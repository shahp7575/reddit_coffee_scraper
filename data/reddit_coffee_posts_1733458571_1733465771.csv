My spider plant which i grew from a baby spiderling into a gorgeous bushy plant has seemingly decided to wither away after a year of growth. Pics 5-6 are from baby to glory, and 1-4 are the sad present. It’s thinned out considerably despite not changing my watering habits, the amount of sunlight, and taking care to repot the plant with the utmost care. The leaves yellow with black/brown at the base and fall off. New ones grow with black tips and only seem to want to grow as skinny, sickly looking leaves. I fear it’s root rot- but don’t know what to do. Is it just repot and hope for the best? I’m heartbroken to see her like this. ",1,1733465432.0,plantclinic,0,1.0,False

1h7urup,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1h7urup/advice_appreciated_family_in_law_entitled_to/,Advice Appreciated - Family in Law entitled to their adult son?,"!!Trigger warning: abusive parents, ableism

Hello there. Here is my TLDR: 
Family (especially MIL) don't want son to move out and don't approve of our relationship. They have time and again proven their ableism and superiority, calling me things like stupid and slow, because I have a speech impediment and autism. They only want me to be a housewife, and live in subservience to them. They are so obsessed with my boyfriend (20M) that they won't let him move out even if it is in his range of possibilities. I (19F) stayed under their roof for a year and finally decided I have had enough, so I packed my bags and left. I told my boyfriend it was his decision whether or not he wanted to join me. They had the audacity to give him an ultimatum and just wait a year to see how he really feels as if I am disposable and replaceable. We've been together since high-school. They won't let him move out. 

Here's more context and the full story:

My boyfriend's parents hate me, more than they should. I am not a morning person. I am not a people's person. I do things on my own time. I have diagnosed depression anxiety and I am neurodivergent.

This comes off as lazy, spoiled, entitled, selfish. I lived with them for a year now. Of course housework and chores are a part of running a house, especially if you pay no rent. It's a different ball game when said people are hoarders(in no way derogatory), and leave me to tend to their whole house and serve 8 people. Cook and clean, the whole perfect traditional housewife ordeal.

They are well aware that I want to study, and work, and they practically forbade me. Their exact words to me were ""If you can't even speak to us properly (because they always berate me) and look at us as if you are stupid and (r-slur), can't look us in the eyes when you talk to us, how will you ever be on your own or work with clients?""

Mind you I have some troubles speaking to them as I am heavily intimidated and cowering in submission, so I stutter and look away when they talk to me. I have, though, worked countless jobs in customer service before and the only problems people ever had with me was to speak up. When it comes to my job I always look people in the eyes and mask, and make sure to speak clearly even if I stutter here and there. People never seemed to have an issue with how I carried myself, I am a completely different person to them in a social situation and I have learned to carry myself better through therapy. I guess that I just come off as a slightly shy and reserved girl to people in customer service, but my I hate that they have so much power over me and use a very real flaw of me as a means of degrading me.

Every morning I wake up at 06:00, make 8 cups of coffee, pack my boyfriend lunch for work and do the dishes. Typically I get back into bed after that until around 09:00, and to them that is unacceptable. It's my duty to be up earlier then everyone else and stay up.

5 times out of 7 days a week, I am expected to sweep, mop, dust, vacuum a whole house. Fair enough the house gets dusty, it's in a rural area, but to ""prove myself"" and ""earn their blessing"", I should be able to ""run the house on my own."" Yes, of course I will do housework and keep my side clean if I am unemployed living under their roof, but asking for help with laundry or skipping a day or ""sleeping in"" is such an awful sin to the point of beratement and shame. Boyfriend works a 9-5 and does all the yardwork, tends to the 7 dogs on his own, helps around in the garage... and still financially contributes 80% of his earnings directly into his dear moms pockets as its his duty.

Their word is law. Children owe their parents. Don't speak back. They can't take accountability. They will never admit fault. They will never apologize. Children must serve them. They still see us, legal adults, as children. 

We thought it would be smart to live with his parents. On the outside they always presented themselves as nice people, we could live there without paying rent, so there were pros. 

This dream died quickly. MIL had too much wine, and told me to my face that I am abusing my boyfriend by having made him pack his own lunch for work one time on a Saturday morning, because I had a flu. She also said that over her dead body will she ever allow him to marry me. 

FIL always takes MIL side, and because of that he always resorts to threats and what not. He is not afraid to hit his sons with a fist. See where I'm going? 

Boyfriend told them respectively he needed time to himself and thought it good that me and him be on our own for some time. They all threw a fit, and convinced (more like threatened, coaxed, forced) my boyfriend not to move out even if he has the opportunity. 

Am I the just no? 
Even if bf might come off as a coward for not defending us (understandably) against his abusive parents, does he still have the right to move out whenever? What laws are keeping him there?
Is it normal for a dad to crack his 14-year-old son's ribs in anger?
Even if I was 100% in the wrong and the rumours were true, does boyfriend still have the right to move out regardless of his parents' textbook spoiled, diva, ""she is disrupting our family"" daughter in law?

If any more context is needed let me know. Yes I had mental health days where I just stayed in bed all day, drew or painted, ""neglected"" my house wife duties, I still came around to my chores on my own time. I've been broken down so much I start to feel like I'm the problem, but I've talked to therapists, my own parents, close friends and everyone as a second opinion, even explained why I might feel like I am the villain, they all give me their unbiased answers, and they all had a similar tone:

We are adults. 

How can my boyfriend move out without his dad hitting him, mom throwing a tantrum, threatening to write him off (when the opposite is in progress)? How to just go? 
If they pick a fight should we call the police?

Please help identify artist and/or help determine value. ,"Hi, I'm new here and hope this is the right subreddit and that I'm not breaking any rules. My grandparents lived overseas for much of their lives including France, Japan, and Vietnam. They had the most amazing house full of treasures and discoveries on every wall and in every drawer. I loved wandering and they let me snoop all I wanted. After they passed, I inherited  a great deal of these treasures. Some are worthless to anyone but me and other things are wildly valuable such as a hand carved marble coffee table commissioned by my grandma from a tradesman in Japan. I've never had any intention to sell any of it despite encouragement from others because I want my home to also be filled with an eclectic bounty of oddities, curiosities, fine art, and more. 

Tragically, we experienced a catastrophic house fire about 3 weeks ago. It destroyed our second floor and caused damage throughout the home. We lost two of our beloved furry family members: our dog and one of our cats. Our smallest kitty was the only survivor. We are grieving hard for them. 

We are having to inventory everything deemed non-salvageable for our insurance claim. I would like to at least give this item a fair value. My mom tried to have it appraised because it is an original but there was not enough information on the piece. I am by no means an art expert but I would guess this was purchased in Paris, France. If not in France, then somewhere on the East Coast US. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for pricing this piece? Thank you!",1,1733464946.0,artcollecting,2,1.0,False

**AITA for laughing at my cousin when she asked me to hang out with her teenage kids?**

&#x200B;

Okay, so this literally JUST happened and I was like “yo, I gotta post this ASAP because what the fuck?”

I just posted recently about my grandfather’s funeral (which was a shitshow within itself), but this started BEFORE the ceremony.

I live in a different state than the majority of my family, I’m 28, work full-time, doing stuff with my day and my life…y’know…being twenty-fuckin’-eight.

OF COURSE, that doesn’t matter and I should always make time for family yada-yada-yada. Let’s just ignore the fact that I actually KNOW about 15% of you by face and maybe 7% by name (sorry, but between the 400 Mildred’s, the 250 Linda’s, 800 Stephanie’s, Chelsea’s and Janet’s that I see once every full planetary alignment…someone’s bound to get lost in the weeds).

I obviously make time for my parents, grandmother, siblings when we’re all available (I’m the youngest out of three and while my job is pretty good, compared to theirs, it’s definitely the most lenient) and anyone else that I see on a regular basis.

ANYWAY, back to the funeral. During the pre-ceremonial gathering, I’m being showered with “do you remember me?”, “do you know who I am?”, “it’s been a long time!” I say yes, yes and yes to avoid the bullshit.

So in the midst of that, one of my cousins whom I have zero memory of, but she apparently regularly talks to my mom, comes up to me and introduces me to her kids. We exchange pleasantries and they seem SUPER happy to meet me and their mom says that’ve been “absolutely dying to meet me”…..

My brain is like “what the fuck”, but I just shake it off at that moment because I wasn’t in a good mood and just didn’t wanna focus on it. My cousin tells me they’re around my age and that they also live in my state and are actually about a 40 minute drive from my place.

Oh, that’s awesome! (I don’t care).

She suggests a little get together sometime later this year and says she’ll talk to my mom about it. Which sure, that’s fine. I mean, it’s not like I’m 14 and have to ask her permission to do anything anymore, but I took it as a “cool, I don’t have to worry about it then” and left it at that.

FAST FORWARD to about 45 minutes ago.

It’s almost midnight.

I get a call from a number that’s based in the city most of my family lives in the other state. Not only that, but it’s a VERY specific location. Too specific to just be a spam call so naturally I kind of panicked. My grandmother was down there at the time and she’s only a few years younger than my late grandfather so call me a little paranoid.

I answer.

“Hey (my name)! It’s (cousin)! How’re you?”

“Heyyyyy! (I don’t know who the fuck). What’s up? What’s going on? Everything okay?”

“Yeah! (Sounding confused by my question). Everything’s fine! I was just calling to see when you were available to meet (son & daughter) for lunch this weekend!”

After I was finally able to put together who this was, I felt like that meme with all the equations floating around because there is NO WAY this woman called me at near midnight to schedule a fuckin’ play date.

I said “I’m sorry, what?”

“Remember at the funeral? We talked about you and (kid’s names) getting together sometime later? (Daughter) is transferring to (university in my city) for her junior year and (son) is applying there too so they’re taking a tour on Saturday morning so I was thinking we could meet you afterward and you could take them somewhere for lunch. Just nowhere with alcohol just (son) is only 18”.

YO, WHAT?????

I remember her saying that they were around my age, but homie can’t even drink???? Then she starts rambling about how her daughter isn’t allowed to drink unless she or her husband are present because she’s 22 and doesn’t know what moderation means.

Maybe this is just me, but what in the God’s green Earth would a 28 (almost 29) year old have to talk about with a 18 and 22 year old that isn’t “don’t do drugs, focus on school and don’t go gettin’ nobody pregnant” not to mention the fact I DON’T EVEN KNOW THESE PEOPLE.

Before I knew it, I had started wheezing and squawking in the phone and cuz did NOT appreciate it.

I couldn’t hear what she said under my laughter, but I was like “yeah, I don’t think so. I work a double on Saturday so I’m not getting off until like 8pm”.

“Well, first of all, I don’t know what was so funny about what I said and you could easily just do a nice dinner or something. 8pm isn’t that late”.

My little patience is gone at this point.

“Ma’am, I work a good 40 minutes away and this isn’t Star Trek. I’m not gettin’ home until around 9 and I am not itchin’ to babysit after an 11 hour shift. I can recommend some spots for y’all to check out yourselves, but this is a college town. You’re not going to find many places with ZERO alcohol, but it’s not like they don’t have other drinks”.

“Excuse me! I know your mother did not raise you to be rude like this ESPECIALLY to family!”

“DUDE, I don’t know you! I have no idea who you are and you’re calling me at witching hour to schedule a hang out with your kids who are in fact NOT around my age”.

“Girl, y’all are all YOUNG adults!”

“I pay for my OWN medical insurance. We are not the same. PLEASE, do not call me again”.

I hung up and had a small cackle fit with my fiancé who was awoken by this nonsense. Obviously I’m not going to hear about this until normal waking hours, but I lowkey hope she wakes my mom and bitches to her about me so my mom can cuss her out for calling either of us at such an ungodly hour.

But I know mom’s going to tell me that I could’ve been a little nicer which honestly, I think I did just fine by not cussing during the conversation, but maybe that’s just me and my zero bullshit tolerance talking.

So AITA?

**Update - some hours later**

&#x200B;

For those of you who saw the original post and were wanting to know how this whole mess ended, I just got off work so I am just now able to post an update.

Turns out, I cursed my mom by making a joke about my cousin calling her to bitch about me after she got off the phone with me because THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT SHE DID.

Woke my poor hardworking mother up to tattle on me. Now my mom’s an absolute peach (in front of me anyway), but I’ve seen her cut up at people like a runaway chainsaw so she wasn’t foolin’ me with her cutesy fairy act. (Tinkerbell can be petty bitch).

While she didn’t tell me what exactly she said, she mentioned that she said “some words” which is her way of saying “I cussed” and she hung up the phone after one sentence.

Once she got up and had her coffee, she called my cousin back and got the full details of the story and that’s when she called me.

I knew my sweet mom was having the worst time trying to keep a straight face and be a mother in that moment because the first thing she asked me when I answered was “did you make a Star Trek reference during a conversation with (cousin) as to why you wouldn’t be able to have dinner with her kids?”

“Yes, I did because she was making it sound like I had a transporter in my pocket, but still just have a car because I like to buy gas or something”.

I could totally hear her trying not to crack up through the phone.

“I don’t think she quite understands your humour, honey”.

“Well, no surprise there because WE DON’T KNOW EACH OTHER”.

She immediately broke and cackled so loud that my dad heard from another room and I heard him crack up through the speaker.

As much as I know she wanted to, she couldn’t bring herself to tell me to apologise just yet and told me to just hold off until (cousin) calms down some, but she’d keep me posted.

This was the part that almost made me crash my car (I was driving to work during this call).

“So, I know what (cousin) did was ridiculous, but do you think it was appropriate to laugh at her?”

I’m not gonna say exactly what he said, but apparently mom made up a very colourful name that included the N-word when my cousin woke her up this morning (don’t worry, we’re all black).

In all of my years of life, not one time have I heard my mom say that and I’m surprised she was able to recover from that amount of rage to even call this woman back let alone have a normal conversation.

So I think it goes without saying, I’m definitely not the way anyone needs to really be worried about pissing off from now on.

Compared to my mom when she’s tired, I’m a box of kittens.

Your mom is amazing, and so are you. Honestly, if someone is calling me after 10 pm, there had better be a damn good reason for it, and if not, I would be using some colourful, creative language too.

Glad to see that the family experience is pretty universal. When I hit 18, I told my mom I wasn't playing nice with her sisters anymore (not outright rude, but I would not be putting up with the passive-aggressive bs). Aunties did not like it, would complain to mom, and she'd just shrug and say ""she's an adult"".

&#x200B;

**Update - 4 days later**

&#x200B;

Alright, guys, I’ve finally gotten some time to sit down to write this out. This will be my final update on the situation with my cousin because I have officially had enough of this raccoon dog of an individual (which is what I will be referring to here as from here on as that is now her name in my contacts).

If you all thought the audacity and entitlement could not be topped, prepare to be just as wrong as I was. And if you did think so, well, I guess I’m just a fuckin’ idiot.

ANYWAY.

Since I was off today, I decided to work on a new beer recipe I conjured up so I’m in the kitchen stove with my brew pot.

Now for context, when you home brew beer, the first thing you do is make the wort which is basically your sugar water. It’s made from a process of boiling grains in a kettle/pot then removing it from heat to add the malt extracts which you have to mix until it’s dissolved before boiling the mixture again. Afterward, you add the hops (what provide bitterness and a variety of flavours). My brews, in particular, are a little more complicated because I used different ingredients that I grow myself in the initial boil. Because of this, I take very great care to not waste any of it because these ingredients do take a long time to grow. This will be important later.

So, I’m chillin’, doing my thing when I get a call from THE RACCOON DOG FROM HELL.

After contemplating whether to send her to voicemail or not, my curiosity got the best of me and I answered.

“Hello?”

“Hey Bleh, it’s RD”.

“Oh, hey…what’s up?”

“So, I just wanted to apologise for the other day. I didn’t even think about what time it was. I’m usually up pretty late chatting with somebody (can’t relate) and I just went ahead and called”.

“Yeah, I feel that, no worries”. (Seething internally).

“So listen, I know we got off to a bad start, but I was hopin’ you’d reconsider hanging out with \[bleh\] and \[bleh\] since they don’t know anyone in that town and…I know you were concerned because you don’t know each other, I get it. I just want them to have someone present that they could be comfortable around”.

Now, as I said in previous comments, I think that’s totally fair. After all, she is their mother and she’s probably just trying to make sure college isn’t a drag for them. I personally hated going to classes and being around people I didn’t know for that long and I really wasn’t feeling the whole college mingle vibe so I took online classes and stayed home so I completely understood where she was coming from and I expressed that.

“Thank you for understanding. Now your mother told me that these things need to be scheduled in advance for you because of your job so I was thinking around Thanksgiving or Christmas time since we’ll all be gathered together anyway”.

“Yeah, sure, since we’ll all be in the same spot anyway. I don’t see why not”.

“Great! Thank you so much! They’re going to be so excited”.

“Awesome, sounds good”. Enter click clack of brew pot being returned to the hot stove.

“Are you cooking something?”

“Yeah”.

“Oh! You know how to cook?? What’re you making?”

“I’m making wort for a new recipe I’m trying out”.

“Wort? What’s that?”

“Oh, it’s the sugar base for beer”.

“…I’m sorry, did you say BEER?”

“Yeah”.

“You’re making BEER?”

“…yeah?”

“Oh, um…does your mother know you’re doing that?”

“She knows I know how to make it, so yeah, I guess?”

“Oh…”. Awkward silence.

“You did hear that I said beer and not cocaine, right?”

“…YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE THAT TOO?!”

“NO! I asked because you’re acting like I’m breaking bad or something”.

“I mean, I’m just concerned about how that might influence the kids so maybe don’t mention that when you hang out?”

Now, I already know that my career choice/hobbies aren’t ideal for some traditional families, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t get a little offended about how she reacted and treated something I’m so passionate about. The only reason I didn’t decline the hang out and hang up was because of the fact that 1. I was going to see them during the holidays anyway and 2. I don’t really talk about my passions in front of my family anyway out of respect and to avoid any extra bullshit so it’s not like it really would’ve been an issue.

So I just rolled my eyes and agreed.

“AWESOME! Okay, so last thing, I know there’s a lot of student housing in that area and cheap apartments so I was wondering which ones we should look into that would be close to the school, but also close to you too”.

Now, THIS is where shit got real and, I’ll be honest, I grinned a little bit.

“Well, my apartment is about a 5-10 minute walk from the school and the rates are pretty decent for a 2-bedroom…”.

“THAT’S FANTASTIC. You guys could be neighbours!”

“Yeahhhh, about that…we actually won’t be in the area because WE’RE MOVING to \[city that I work in that’s almost 40 miles away\] before the new year”.

“Okayyyy…? I’m not really following. You’re saying you won’t be able to come see them?”

Insert Britney Spears WTF face.

“Well…no, not really. The whole purpose of the move is for us to be closer to our jobs so we won’t have to drive that far”.

“But you do it all the time so…I just don’t see why you wouldn’t be able to do it like…once or twice a week to go see them”.

“Uuuuhhhhh…that would actually be super inconvenient for me I don’t think that would be very plausible”.

“It’s inconvenient to spend a few hours of time with your family? Don’t you drive further to get to \[city where my parents live\]?”

“I mean, yeah, but it’s usually because of traffic”.

“So, you’ll be even further when you move and you’d go see them anyway so I don’t understand what’s so inconvenient about you driving halfway to spend time with your cousins. Especially on days like today where all you’ll be doing is making alcohol when you could be spending time with your family. I mean, it’s just…I feel your priorities here are a little backwards”.

Now I have PAINFULLY and CAREFULLY picked and chose my words while talking to this person during all of our conversations, but my brain pushed Civility in the closet and locked it for the rest of this conversation.

“I’m sorry, did you really just compare the level of importance between your kids that I have said exactly one word to in my entire 28 years of life to my fuckin’ PARENTS?”

“Okay, first of all, honey, I don’t know who the HELL you think you talkin’ to-“.

“Who the fuck are you again? What do I owe you again? What part of my day or time do you deserve a piece of again? What meaning are you in my life again? What would I miss if we hadn’t met again? OH, NOTHING BECAUSE I DON’T FUCKING KNOW YOU and I don’t care if you decide to move in my fuckin’ attic (I don’t have an attic) I’m going to go see why parents and bring them all the homemade booze I want YEARS before I even remember your fuckin’ NAME and FUCK YOU for distracting me because my pot boiled over and now my fucking wort is RUINEEEEED!!!!”

That last part was in the heat over the moment, but I almost lost it when I heard my fiancé bust a laugh in the next room. From what he described to me later, he said I sounded like an angry Bubbles from the Powerpuff Girls.

After that, I don’t even remember if she said anything because I was trying to clean up the sticky mess of my ruined concoction off of my stove and floor before my cat could get to it and was just cursing under my breath and all my irritation could muster was an angry “see you on Thanksgiving” before I hung up.

I haven’t heard anything else from anyone, but considering that blow up was so out of character for me, I’m almost 120% sure no one will have the nerve. It’s rare that I actually get mad so when I do, my parents have always just made sure I was okay and left it alone and would gatekeep anyone that tried to bring it up later.

My fiancé came to help me clean the mess and I gotta give him props for being able to quickly make me laugh about how the sound I made when I saw the pot boil over.

I jokingly asked if he thinks I’d get in trouble for that, but he said that he thinks I scared her enough to send back to trash den for the a while.

I hope you guys have enjoyed this train wreck that I’ve unleashed upon you and that your Thanksgiving is going to be as interesting as mine will be this year.

**Update - 7 weeks later**

ALRIGHT.

For everyone that was super invested in my family drama and wanted this last update, I did not forget you!

This is just the first time I’ve had since Thanksgiving where I’ve had absolutely nothing to do.

This will be the last update of this rollercoaster of mayhem so thank you everyone that took time out of their day to read all this and I’m happy that I was able to entertain you.

NOW for the moment you’ve all been waiting for.

I know most of you guys were thinking it was going to be some sort of media circus monstrosity family dinner because I did too, but the Goddess of Chaos decided to be my bestie this year and make this holiday just oh, so perfect for me.

Thanksgiving with my family…WAS CLOSED.

My parents went to visit my brother, my grandmother went to home in honour of my grandfather, AND my fiancé and I BOTH had to work Black Friday so we spent our Thanksgiving AT HOME IN PEACE.

We had a delicious meal, delicious drinks brewed by moi and cuddly PJ’s with a horror movie marathon.

It was absolute perfection and I was lovin’ it like a fat cat in a canned tuna factory.

But then…

MY PHONE RANG.

It’s a number I don’t recognise so I ignore it. They go to voicemail. I’m on holiday vacation mode so that can wait until tomorrow.

A few minutes later, another call. Same number. Then another few minutes, another. Then another. Then another.

At this point, I’m about to put a salt barrier around my phone like that would somehow repel a phone stalker.

Then my fiancé, being the rational genius he is, suggests that I listen to the voicemail…that I had completely forgotten about.

I put it on speaker for us to listen to…

“Hey \[SFM\] this is \[LANDLORD!!!!!\]…I’m using my personal phone because obviously…the office is closed. I am so sorry to interrupt your holiday, but I’m going to need you to call me back AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE”.

Well, I’ve missed about 8 calls from this woman at this point, so I panic call her back.

Now at this point, you all are probably wondering where the Racoon Dog comes in. Oh, baby, it’s about to feel like Christmas.

Now, as I’m typing this out days after this went down, I don’t have the conversation memorised word for word, but I know I can get it pretty close. I remember what I said and my landlord was less than professional during this conversation (no judgment, I would’ve been pissed to) so I think I’ll be able to get the gist across.

I call my landlord.

“Hello?” (Her tone like she found the whole turkey in the toilet).

“Hey! I’m so sorry, I didn’t know this was you and I was-“

“Nah, nah, honey! I get it. You were enjoying your holiday like WE ALL should be. Don’t even worry about it”.

“Okay (insert nervous chuckle here), so…what’s up? What’s going on?”

“Do you know a woman by the name of \[RACOON DOG\]?”

Dude, the fact that I STILL forgot her name so I said “not off the top of my head, no”.

“Alright, well she knows you and has been giving our courtesy officer hell for the past hour and a half because she said you invited her kids over and now she can’t get ahold of you”.

TELL ME THIS BITCH DIDN’T TAKE THE “SEE YOU ON THANKSGIVING” COMMENT I MADE DURING OUR LAST PHONE CALL AS AN INVITATION TO COME TO MY HOME!!

Now at this point, I’m STILL not putting two and two together since it’s been A MONTH since my last interaction with this human. So I’m over here panicking like a squirrel trying to cross a busy intersection because for my landlord to call me from her CELLPHONE on THANKSGIVING…my brain said “eviction notice”.

I explained that I have no idea who this could POSSIBLY be because neither of us invited anybody.

Landlord goes full nail salon black lady mode at this point.

“See, that’s what I thought because you guys don’t ever really have nobody around like that anyway. (RIP my landlord knowing that my fiancé and I antisocial hermits) But she knows your name, she didn’t mention \[fiancé\] and has been demanding we give her your room number, like really? No respectable establishment would just give out their tenants information like that even if we did you still breaking the law”.

“What’s she doing???”

“She parked in front of the fire zone with her kids in the car and is shouting ‘police brutality’ because our courtesy officer gave her a fine and told her that if she don’t move, we’re going to have her car towed”.

Mind you, the fine here for parking in front of a fire zone run between $500-$2,000 depending location and severity of the situation. My apartment is VERY close to the university and the main road to the separate properties is a very commonly used route directly to many of the university buildings as well as the a third of the fraternities.

So if there was a fire in that area, that section would most definitely be blocked off so they take this VERY VERY VEEEEERY seriously.

“Did she move???”

“NO! She got a fine for the fire zone and a then she threatened the courtesy officer so he had to call for BACKUP AND HER KIDS ARE STILL IN THE CAR”.

I CACKLED while I’m obviously still panicking because I STILL don’t know who this is because I’m an idiot.

My fiancé started laughing like a maniac next to me.

“YOOOO, IT’S RACOON DOG (He’s in on the joke)!! I just texted your mom!”

“BIIIIIIIIIITCH, WWWWHAT?!”

My landlord’s like “what dog??” and I explain EVERYTHING to her from the beginning and I can hear all the energy leave her body because all she can do is laugh.

This poor woman sounds so beaten down and exhausted as she asks me if I can officially state that I didn’t invite her and don’t want her here. I confirm this and this beautiful woman goes “alright, I got this bitch. Y’all have yourselves an ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL Thanksgiving”.

We ended the call and just in a silent mixture between disbelief, shock and trying not to laugh.

I kept thinking about this woman’s kids and how fuckin’ embarrassed they must’ve been. How I haven’t heard from somebody that they’ve run away at this point is beyond me.

I tried to muster SOMETHING to say and all I did was open my mouth before my fiancé stopped me with a…

“NOPE. Nope, nope, nope. Nope. Eat. Watch” and just pressed play on our movie. Honestly, I had no idea what to say so I just complied while trying to hold in my laugh and not choke on my food.

I found out from my mom later that RD had contacted her and threw the BIGGEST TANTRUM because I apparently lied to her about spending Thanksgiving with her kids (during a phone call where I had literally cussed her out) AND caused her to get fined $2,000 by the courtesy officer (directed by my landlord) AS WELL AS her husband having to bail her out of jail for $3,500 AS WELL AS $7,500 fine for resisting arrest, trespassing, and threats of violence toward a police officer.

Yeah, aren’t I the fuckin’ worst?

And I didn’t even have to lift a FINGER.

I still have barely any words on the situation and am still trying to convince myself that it actually happened and that it started from a random unsolicited phone call in the middle of the night a couple of months ago.

Now, did you guys think that was the best part? WRONG.

The pièce de résistance…

Two days ago…

Her kids made a group chat on one of my social media accounts with the three of us…and APOLOGISED FOR THEIR PSYCHO MOTHER AND ALL THE SHIT SHE’S GIVEN ME ABOUT HANGING OUT WITH THEM.

They said they had wanted to apologise for a while on her behalf, but were so embarrassed that they figured they’d just leave me alone, but what happened on Thanksgiving was the straw that broke the camel’s back for them which…YEAH.

The fact that instead of spending Thanksgiving with loved ones, enjoying a huge feast and a whole day to chill, these kids spent the majority of their day in the middle of a spectacle of pure insanity brought on by their delusional mother in a car at a random apartment complex and had to sit in a police station for who knows how long until they able to be picked up by the dad knowing their mom would be in jail overnight and getting her out alone would probably blow half of their Christmas fund…

All I could say in response was…

“There’s a really great pizza place up the street. I don’t know what you guys’ schedule is like, but I’m off next Friday and it’s on me”.

Now I’ve got a restraining order and a pizza date this weekend.

Combo made in heaven.

I hope y’all had as much fun reading this as I did writing it out. This whole thing has been SUCH a clustefuck dumpster explosion and I’m glad you all enjoyed sitting in it with me. Hope you guys had an awesome Thanksgiving with tons of love, food comas, sweatpants and NO cops (unless you’re a cop).

*I think it’s hilarious that after all she went through to strong arm you into having contact with her kids you are having lunch with her kids because she is psycho Sally.*

I don't know, maybe I overthink it but I do think small actions count and show your interest.

We with my LDR boyfriend pretty much every night and and morning say goodnight/good morning.

I am a couple of hours ahead of him so in most times I am the one who writes that first. And some times in the mornings he replies late. About 3 hrs after he woke up. When we talk during the day it's pretty clear he wasn't busy in the morning, like he woke up, had his coffee, read news or something else. (He doesn't have a job, so he almost never needs to hurry somewhere in the morning.)

So am I overreacting by thinking that it is strange to see a message from your partner and just simply not answer?
For me, if a person does that, it feels like replying is seen as a chore and not something you are happy to do. For instance when I receive his messages I am always eager to reply as soon as I can. And usually I am quick with that unless I am busy, like I am in a work call or I have a lot of work (but then I write him beforehand that I'll be busy and write him later) or my phone is simply not with me/put away to not distract me.

So in my opinion it's something that should happen naturally because when you like someone you just feel happy to reply and want to talk/be with that person as much as you can. It could be that I am reacting more sensitive because of his replies overall. Like one evening we supposed to clarify some things but I didn't feel that we did. Wrote him I still feel pretty sad could we have a call. He replied after 1.5hr sure, I just need to do couple of things. After another half an hour I said I am going to sleep. It was already midnight for me. And he was annoyed and felt I did something wrong by asking for a call and then going to sleep.

Anyway, now I just want to stop writing it. Because I see it as just him not interested enough.

P.s. It would be a different thing if we wouldn't be LDR. But now texting and calling are the only things we can do.
And he doesn't have a problem with texting. We chatted a lot in the beginning and that was mostly initiated by him. He was even the first to write good morning every day, that's why I picked it up from him",1,1733464593.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

As a child, I assumed everyone saw them, a mind's attempt to make sense of what it saw.  My whole life I’ve seen them. I'd turn a corner, catch the glimpse of something, and vanish on a double take. I never really saw what they were, never really thought more about them. That was until about a month ago, when things started to get worse.

I stared blankly at my computer screen, struggling to keep my eyes open, like any other day. My desk, situated in a high-traffic area of the office, faced the main walkway.  It was a spot I’d grown accustomed to over the years, and I found myself glancing up whenever someone walks by. It's a habit, really - a way of staying connected to the world around me.  The computer screen started to blur, I had been staring at the same excel sheet for too long.  That’s when I noticed it.  From the corner of my eye, a shadow, creeping in slowly from around the corner.  So slow, hardly any movement.  Flicking my head over to where it was, was being the keyword.  It was gone.  I remember getting up from my chair, cautiously, because my mind was still racing from what I'd just seen. I had to check, though - I had to make sure I hadn't just missed someone walking by.  Normally when I had seen them, it was just a black shapeless silhouette. No details, no other color. This time it was in a more defined shape.  This time I swear I saw tendrils.  The shadow figure I'd seen earlier seemed to be seared into my brain. I found myself glancing over my shoulder, expecting to see it looming around the corner again.  But was I really seeing it? Or was it all just a product of my own fevered imagination? I started to wonder if I was losing my grip on reality.

I found myself staring blankly at the corner, my breathe coming in rapidly, the tendril wrapping itself around my mind.  What did I see? A shadow.  No.  But what made me look over there?  A shadow of a tendril. No, how could there be a shadow of nothing?  I couldn’t let the questions take over, so I threw myself into my work.  Shaking off the experience.  Letting out my breath slowly, dropping my shoulders.  Going through all the skills I knew for anxiety; I was soon calm.

These shadows never seemed to happen frequently.  At most 2 to 3 times a week at most and that didn’t change.  What did change was the shape. Now I saw detail. I saw the tendrils.  They seemed to extend out from the black body.  At first, I tried to brush it off as mere paranoia, but as the days passed, I found myself becoming increasingly obsessed with catching another glimpse. I started staying awake at night, scouring the room for any sign of movement. And then, it happened. I saw one.  Stretching out from behind the door, I kept my eyes on the tv, not daring to move or blink.  My eyes burned with the need to blink, but I knew I couldn’t look away.  I got you, I thought.  As I watched, the tendril began to move, creeping slowly across the carpet. My breath caught in my throat, and I felt my heart racing with anticipation. But it was no use. My eyes, pleading for relief, burned with the need to blink, but I knew I couldn’t look away.  Ever so slowly I closed my right eye, ignoring the increasing pain in my left. They stayed.  I tried the same process for the left, but as my eye lid started to move, the tendrils retracted with it.  My hands trembled, teeth clenched, I fought.  I couldn’t bare it any longer and blinked.  They were gone. I cursed at myself, frustrated and defeated.  Hours of waiting, wasted with one blink. And now, I have to be at work in an hour. Grumpily, I got up, rubbed my eye, and stumbled towards the coffee maker. Work was going to suck.",2,1733464538.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

A warm brown has gained the title for 2025
In excited as a true spring in Australia where the fashion market is currently overflowing with black white and beige hopefully this will have some impact and I will.be able to source some items harmony in pallette.

Thoughts? 
Do you like this brown on you?

Article below: 
Pantone has named an ""evocative soft brown"" its colour of the year for 2025, continuing a tradition that has now run for more than a quarter of a century.
In a statement published today, the global colour specialist said Mocha Mousse was ""a mellow brown infused with a sensorial and comforting warmth"".
""A warming rich brown hue, PANTONE 17-1230 Mocha Mousse nurtures with its suggestion of the delectable quality of cacao, chocolate and coffee, appealing to our desire for comfort,"" it added.
Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, said the colour evokes ""thoughtful indulgence"".
""Sophisticated and lush, yet at the same time an unpretentious classic, PANTONE 17-1230 Mocha Mousse extends our perceptions of the browns from being humble and grounded to embrace the aspirational and luxe,"" she said in the statement.
Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute, added that Mocha Mousse feeds into a desire for harmony.
With that in mind, for Pantone Color of the Year 2025, we look to a colour that reaches into our desire for comfort and wellness, and the indulgence of simple pleasures that we can gift and share with others,"" she said.
Each December, Pantone names a colour of the year for the following year, and this is the 26th time that it has done so.
To make their pick, experts at the Pantone Color Institute trawl through high-fashion runways, interior design trends, pop culture moments and human psychology.
The first Color of the Year was Sky Blue in 1999, while more recent choices include Peach Fuzz- ""a light, fruity tone that conjures peace and serenity"" - in 2024 and Viva Magenta - ""an unconventional shade for an unconventional time"" - in 2023.

A warm brown has gained the title for 2025
In excited as a true spring in Australia where the fashion market is currently overflowing with black white and beige hopefully this will have some impact and I will.be able to source some items harmony in pallette.

Thoughts? 
Do you like this brown on you?


Pantone has named an ""evocative soft brown"" its colour of the year for 2025, continuing a tradition that has now run for more than a quarter of a century.
In a statement published today, the global colour specialist said Mocha Mousse was ""a mellow brown infused with a sensorial and comforting warmth"".
""A warming rich brown hue, PANTONE 17-1230 Mocha Mousse nurtures with its suggestion of the delectable quality of cacao, chocolate and coffee, appealing to our desire for comfort,"" it added.
Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, said the colour evokes ""thoughtful indulgence"".
""Sophisticated and lush, yet at the same time an unpretentious classic, PANTONE 17-1230 Mocha Mousse extends our perceptions of the browns from being humble and grounded to embrace the aspirational and luxe,"" she said in the statement.
Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute, added that Mocha Mousse feeds into a desire for harmony.
With that in mind, for Pantone Color of the Year 2025, we look to a colour that reaches into our desire for comfort and wellness, and the indulgence of simple pleasures that we can gift and share with others,"" she said.
Each December, Pantone names a colour of the year for the following year, and this is the 26th time that it has done so.
To make their pick, experts at the Pantone Color Institute trawl through high-fashion runways, interior design trends, pop culture moments and human psychology.
The first Color of the Year was Sky Blue in 1999, while more recent choices include Peach Fuzz- ""a light, fruity tone that conjures peace and serenity"" - in 2024 and Viva Magenta - ""an unconventional shade for an unconventional time"" - in 2023.

Hello, everyone. Thank you for your time.

I'm looking to move away from my current job as a barista due to lack of hours (can't keep up with financial demands comfortably) and into a more stable 40-hour work week career. I am wildly comfortable with computers, including the Microsoft Office Suite and the Adobe Creative Suite, which I've used for many years. I'm technically savvy and capable of solving nearly all problems.

Due to life's events, I did not finish college after entering as a first year (when it was practically free for me) and am now unable to attend due to financial restrictions. I'm looking to progress into something that is climbable. Voice over is my passion and career, but it too demands financial backup, and I will continue to make progress there where and when possible.

I am located in Nebraska and am looking to apply for jobs around the Omaha area. I will likely be utilizing a staffing company that I was recommended to by my friend who was very happy with them. I am currently unwilling to relocate.

I am mostly here seeking fine-tuning for my resume and any advice on how I can make my resume more confident or enticing.",1,1733463498.0,resumes,1,1.0,False

And here are our questions regarding them. I'd be very grateful to anyone who answers them, thanks, because my mind is sunn enough to not even being able to process the taste of coffee.

1) Does the gold digging exploitative tendencies run through the entire Namdaar family, along with then acting all righteous about it? Mirza saab was so against his daughter working for BA, given his reputation, but was ever so eager to accept the car sent for her for no conceivable reason? His wife is of course a league of her own, Gucci Prada making here go yada yada. The brother was still somewhat sane, atleast trying to talk sense into his sister. And the said sister, Cleopatra of the Age, Aphrodite's reincarnation, Sadaf Namdaar herself? Chef's kiss woman she is. Pure chef's kiss.

2) Everyone going up in arms against Humsha for being manipulative and all, granted that she is morally convoluted, but she is not exactly the reason behind everyone acting like a bimbo, is she? When Sadaf first asks her about Bilal, she gives a very professional answer, sharing her experience with her, and clearly mentioning that Bilal has never been inappropriate with her. Even when Bilal asked her about Sadaf, she clearly praises Sadaf. She only starts with the manipulation once Sadaf joins BA group and starts acting all fishy, and thus Humsha starts considering her as a threat to what she wants. And frankly, that's animalistic  instinct, you try deviating any threat to you, no matter how. But Sadaf approached BA inspite of being told only good things about him by Humsha, meaning her notion about him was already  set. So how is Humsha the only one to be blamed for every baffling thing everybody else, especially Sadaf sweetheart does? 

3) Is Bilal really such a naïve little boy that he gets no inkling whatsoever about Humsha's intentions towards him, inspite of having multiple 'marasims'? The woman comes close enough to smell your breakfast from your breath, and you don't even flinch or step back? You ask her to come over with you for a dinner she has not been invited to but says she'll go wherever you ask her to and you just smile and nod? You call her over for dinner and arrange for a date setup only to talk about your toota phoota dil, and expect the woman to not get any ideas seeing the setup? Either he really is a saint who has for long now been performing abstinence, or is a plain and simple, what we lovingly and charmingly call 'ASSHOLE'. Because if Humsha would obviously not care for boundaries, but if you are so deeply in love with Sadaf, atleast you step back a bit, keep your distances?

4) Is Sadaf, the lovely girl that she is, suffering from personality disorder? Because none of her words and actions actually align with each other. And the way she treats everyone? Pure acchi ladki display of kindness and grace. 

5) The production spent so much money, effort and grandeur for the wedding of the heroine to the second lead? They really did that? And imagine all of it coming out to be purely cringe and impactless in spite of it all. And on a side note, I guess it's a bestie thing to pose like the main couple in each other's wedding to other people, whether it be reel or real. The dip was such a classic tribute to another similar event not long back, that it brought tears to my eyes. Such distinct friendship we stan and cherish. 

In conclusion, the stellar script, direction and performances has rendered me at least very dazzled. Pakistan now has its KJo, SRK and Kajol and we cheer for them.  ",5,1733463361.0,PAKCELEBGOSSIP,1,1.0,False

🌸 So, earlier this year, my cousin told me about this guy she had fallen for. He studied with her and had been in a long-term relationshio with his then girlfriend. 

**They had been together for 3 years and counting.** 🦋

Good for them. But not so hot for my sis, lol 😂

🌸 Now I heard her talk about this dude for the longest time but didnt do anything about it at all because, well, I was not convinced lmao 😂

***She does have this habit of getting obsessed with someone and then after a few weeks, she'd have a new crush*** 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️😂

So I let it be. 

🌸 Until around July, I realized that she was really depressed about this 3P situation. **It hurt her to see him walking around with his girlfriend.** 

She indirectly mentioned it many times how she wished they could magically be together somehow! 

🌸 Well, THAT was my cue. 🦋

I was already satisfied with my love life by then and wasn't actively working on anything for myself so ***I decided to manifest her dream realtionship for her.*** 

🌷 Mind you, she did not and still don't know what I did and I prefer it that way hehe 🩷

🌸 ***SOOOO, WHAT DID I DO?!?*** 

I am a STRICT follower of Neville's **Golden Rule** - 

> *""Do unto others as you'd like to be done unto you.""* 

So I knew I had to approach this carefully becaise personally? I did not know what kinda relationship the guy had with his current girlfriend. 

> **And Neville ALWAYS asks us to assume the fulfilemt of any desire from a state of love, especially where a person is involved.** 

🌸 So, that's EXACTLY what I did! 

***I imagined my cousin telling me excitedly, how happy she was with the guy, who we'll call M, and how the 3P and her were good friends too!*** 

I made sure I kept my feeling as noble and positive about it as I possibly could every single time I looped this scene. 

🌸 Keep in mind, I try to saturate my mind with a SINGLE SENSE in any given scene so **I mostly focuaed on hearing her excited voice, instead of worrying about seeing her face vividly.** 

Because it all comes on it's own anyway. 

So, I let the rest of the scene come up on its own. My focus is always on ONE ACTION. And here it was, hearing her voice. 

🌸 I started towards the end of July and around mid-August, she told me that M and his girlfriend had broken up because **she decided to focus on her studies and thought the relationship was distracting her.** 🤷🏻‍♀️

Meanwhile, M and my cousin became good friends. They'd begun playing badminton together and going on coffee-dates. 

***""Just as friends""*** she said! 

AS IF! 😂

🌸 Fast forward to now, they are currently in a loving relationship and my cousin recently introduced him to her mom as well on her birthday!!! 

How cool is that! 

🥳 I am so very happy! Especially because, as she tells me, the 3p in question has no negative feelings towards M at all! And if they ever see each other somewhere, they always talk nicely and she's happy focusing on her goals to get into a uni of her choice. Excited even, as my cousin last told me! 

🌸🌸🌸

Soooo, there you go, guys! 

A boost of positivity for you to keep going, hehe. 🥳

Until next time,

56 yr old married male looking for an on-line connection/relationship.  I’ve been married 25 yrs and in a stable relationship.  Not looking for change and have a zero drama life.  However, as is so common, I am missing things in my life.  I miss the daily connection with someone - working from a home office since 2008 doesn’t help either.  Would love to find a gal in a similar situation (prefer married/divorced mom, just more in common but all welcome to reply) who would like someone to talk with, and share, someone to connect with.  Looking to find someone with common ground and similar experiences. 

I will not bug you to “hook up”. I’m not opposed to eventually meeting/coffee date but that is not the end game.  If you are not in the area, that’s fine too.  I do travel a lot for work, especially up and down the west coast.
I will not bug you for pictures.  If you want to swap a couple face pics that would be great.  But it is not a deal breaker if you don’t want to do that, or do it right away.
You will not get unsolicited pics from me - re: no announced dick pics.  Ugh.
I don’t chat with multiple people - first reply gets 100% of my attention.
I am a mature, kind person.  No judgement, no drama, good listener, empathetic.  I like to ask questions.  If it matters, I am attractive and take very good care of myself and my body.  I am a business professional and I have lots of things to talk about - I’m big into music, fountain pens and inks.  I can hold intelligent and coherent conversations.  Looking to discover passion in ordinary things.  I have done the OLA before and I do have a lot of time to invest into it.  I’m emotionally in a good position to do this.  Please be at least 30 yrs old and in the U.S.A.  If you reach out, please write me a couple of sentences introduction.  It helps to weed out the spam.

I’m using google sheets for managing the expenses for two years. This will be my third year and every year I make upgrade to make the system perfect.

Chatbot will add entries and I need to perform actions.  So my question is, How to calculate total amount spend in particular year and month with the particular category. And one more thing, me and my wife adding these vales thats why the username column is there. SO at the end, I need to compare the Expense column with the Category array and find out which is the category is that and according to that It will sum the values with filter of year and month.

**Posted January 29, 2019**

I work at a small company with about 10 employees. Because it is such a small team, and most people have been there for a long time (10+ years for most), it is a very relaxed environment — and unfortunately, this has bred some bad habits and toxicity into the culture. Nothing especially groundbreaking, and for the most part it was being ignored since most of the negativity was coming from one source — our main admin, Karen.

This fall, an opportunity opened up for me to work exclusively from home, due to the nature of my particular position, and I jumped on it. I go into into the main office about twice a month, and for the most part, it’s been a dream. I am vastly more productive, work hard to ensure that I maintain good work-from-home habits, and have found that my mental health has improved drastically.

Since the transition, I have done everything I can think of to set clear expectations as far as when I am available. I have specific, set hours when they can expect me to be at my desk. I use Google Hangouts’ away messages to say if I’m up from my desk for a quick break to stretch my legs, use the bathroom, etc. (with a time I’ll be back). I also always have my personal cell on me in case it’s a (rare) emergency.

I do most of my communication with clients and our team via email, but I do have a VOIP phone that dials out with the main office number, and I can be inter-office paged via this phone as well.

Almost the whole team is great with this arrangement, with one exception: Karen cannot seem to respect these boundaries. She’ll page me outside of my work hours, or regardless of whether I have an away message set, and if I don’t get to my phone fast enough (I can hear it elsewhere in the house), she’ll call my cell — usually for a very simple question that could have waited, or could have been an email. If I point out that I set an away message, she’ll say, “Sorry, I didn’t see it.” I have even paged her and told her I’ll be unavailable for an hour, and she’ll agree pleasantly, and then turn around and page me 15 minutes later, followed by the usual call to my cell if I don’t pick up. I will also often come back to see that she’s IM’d me in an effort to get my attention, as well.

When I politely point out that I had set an away message/was away for a short time/this question could have been an email/etc., Karen will often reply with, “Well, I didn’t think it was a big deal since you’re already there!”

My position does have a certain degree of needing to be on-call — if certain things happen with my projects at any time of day, I do need to act — but Karen’s questions are rarely about that so much as spellchecking and nitpicking coworkers’ work, which is another problem she has and one of the chief reasons I leaped at this opportunity to keep my job but not work in that office.

I should note that working from home is a perk offered to everyone as an as-needed thing, and there is one other employee who works from home full-time. I asked him, and he says that he has not experienced this level of intrusion at all, and then when he says he’s busy, Karen leaves him alone — no away messages needed. Meanwhile, when I say I’m busy, Karen says, “Oh, I knowwww, we all are,” and continues with her question/behavior.

What can I do differently to enforce these boundaries? I have stopped running to the phone if I’ve communicated that I’m away and I hear a page or IM, but that doesn’t stop the inevitable tide of calls and texts to my cell phone, or sometimes she’ll just page and page and page until I get sick of hearing it and answer, even though I’m taking a break. I pride myself on being just as available now as if I were in the main office, but at this point, I’m being forced into being much more “available” at home than I ever was when I worked in that building.

How do I keep from turning my work-at-home situation into, “Haha actually I just live at work, now”?

P.S. I had this open as a draft, got up to refill my coffee after setting a “BACK AT 10:30” away message — yes, with the all-caps — and what do I hear from my kitchen but a page and a “Hello? Helloooooooooooooooooooooooo?”

**\[Allison writes back and asks if the paging can be muted or turned off\]**

I don’t know if I can mute it — I can turn it down so I can’t hear it elsewhere in the house, and I have, but then I get bombarded with texts and passive-aggressive comments when I come back to my computer. Right now I have it at a volume where I can hear it if I’m up, but it’s not startlingly loud if I’m sitting at my desk, either.

I suppose I’m also worried about drawing the boundary too firmly, and seeming unavailable to my colleagues who aren’t Karen, you know? I can definitely see the value in being able to communicate within the office quickly, and it definitely does make working from home easier. But there have been plenty of times when I’ve tried to page a colleague, can’t get ahold of them in that moment, and either make a note to try back later or write an email if it’s urgent, and move on. That’s the overall staff’s approach (regardless of whether working remote or in the brick-and-mortar building.) It’s just Karen who seems to think that since I literally live at my office, I should be able to respond instantaneously to the pages and IMs.

[Update 1](https://www.askamanager.org/2019/02/updates-my-coworker-wants-me-available-24-7-my-boss-had-his-wife-do-our-work-and-more.html)

**Posted February 25, 2019 (27 days later)**

First of all: thank you so much for publishing my letter! Your advice, along with the commentariat, was perfect. I keep my phone super-quiet now, and don’t jump when she calls. I also think that a lot of the commenters picked up on the fact that I was trying to “prove” I was working just as effectively from home and not doing anything helpful with my minutae-based away messages.

I was all happy to let this go and move on with my life, but we actually had a fairly bizarre outside incident happen the other day and Karen’s boundary-pushing is actually about to get her in trouble with someone besides me!

As I mentioned before, we are a small, family-owned company. Very sadly, our owner suffered a stroke and passed away last week. The owner’s son, Norman, is our CEO, so the status quo is remaining relatively the same but we’re all pretty sad. Norman has missed a few days of work due to the loss, but we’re plodding along, business-wise.

However, at the funeral this week, apparently Karen decided to bring some contracts that needed to be discussed and signed off on. And decided it would be a good idea to ask Norman to review/sign these documents while he was meeting with the other pallbearers, while they were all gathered around his father’s casket. (!!!!)

All of us from the office saw this happen and frankly none of us knew what to say — it was so surreal! Fortunately, Norman just shut her down with a firm, “This is really not a good time,” which is much more diplomatic than what I think I might have said in that situation.

I suspect Karen will be spoken to about this, since Norman is aware of my complaints re: Karen as well (and I’m not the only one who’s had issues with her boundary-stomping in the past), and I might have a pretty strong ally moving forward, now.

[Update 2](https://www.askamanager.org/2019/04/update-i-work-from-home-and-my-coworker-wants-me-available-24-7.html)

**Posted April 4, 2019 (65 days from the first post, 38 days from the update)**

I just want to give everyone a wee update-to-the-update — to cut to the chase, Karen wasn’t fired.

However. This is horrible and gossipy, but I am friends with the guy who has the office next door to Karen in the brick-and-mortar building, and he mentioned that our CEO, Norman, came into the office (he has been absent lately due to stuff with his dad’s death). Norman had an hour-long closed-door meeting in Karen’s office. The walls in that building are pretty thin, but my friend said they didn’t need to be — Norman apparently got “fairly animated” (friend’s words) about being approached to sign things at his dad’s funeral, and then brought up that this isn’t the first time this has been an issue. (My friend didn’t elaborate, just said that my complaints “among all the others” had been brought up — and then he decided he didn’t want to be essentially caught with his ear to the door when Norman left, and he found a project elsewhere in the building.)

Karen went home for the rest of the day after this talking-to, and that was on Tuesday. When she came back in on Wednesday, my friend said that she stuck mostly to herself, and is almost…hiding? People are coming to her for things rather than vice-versa, and she hasn’t paged ANYONE — not just me, but anyone. (I really don’t think anyone is missing it.)

I think she is embarrassed, probably mostly by her behavior at the funeral, and is now laying low. I’m hopeful that this will be a wakeup call to her, and that she’ll understand that her need to get work done doesn’t trump EVERYTHING. My friend with the neighboring office also offered that he thinks Karen isn’t very happy at home, and that with our grandboss dying, she was probably trying to really sublimate herself in work and get through it — I can be sympathetic to that, even if I think bringing contracts to a funeral is WILDLY inappropriate.

Anyway. Cheers! Thanks for all your validation and outrage on my/Norman’s behalf! You guys are all great (especially you, Alison!)",86,1733461948.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,18,0.97,False

Unfortunately, I am unable to leave quickly. Many of you may have read about it. I have to stay in the same house with her. Went NC with her mother as she was encouraging her daughter for all the behaviors and justifying that she is a child like individual (38 year old child).


I am having minimal conversations mainly through texts because she has changed her words every time. 

We are staying at the wife's place, and the wife has been trying to hoover me because i have kept very strict boundaries since last 7 months. 

First, she said about her not getting her periods because there is no sex (I have not had sex with her for over 7 months). She got her periods all the other months previous to this, and there was no problem. Since I said no it she was upset.

The next day she asked about visiting my home. She hasn't even looked into how they are except calling them to say about arguments and fights. Now she wants to visit them. I said no to this as well.

Today, she has come with an oversized shirt and asked me to fold the sleeves for her. I told her to do it herself but she insisted on it. I said I dont know how to do it, and I walked into the kitchen pretending to make coffee. 

I have tried to keep boundaries, and she has been trying to break them. Have you also experienced anything as such because I don't want to lose my cool and have that as a reason for reactive abuse. ",1,1733461710.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

1) 50/50 glue and water on bases
2) buried in coffee grounds and tea leaves, extra shaken off.
3) let dry

4) 10 / 90 glue to water ontop to make the tops stay
5) let dry
6) paint dark, drybrush light, wash, drybrush light again
7) varnish, if necessary

1) remove the coffee/  glue disk

Basically some behaviors other than the standard ones listed in literally every internet article google spits out.  They were really good actually and I thought I’d share them here.

Below is a list of less obvious or less commonly discussed signs that, taken together, might raise concern about possible infidelity. It’s crucial to remember that these signs are not definitive proof; there are often innocent explanations. If you are concerned, the best approach is open, honest communication.
	
       1.	Unusual Knowledge in Specific Areas:
They suddenly know a lot about a topic (a niche hobby, a particular restaurant scene, a specific sport) that doesn’t align with your shared interests or their known pursuits. This can happen if they’ve been spending time with someone who’s introducing new interests.
	
       2.	Shift in Vocabulary or Speech Patterns:
Adopting new slang, catchphrases, or mannerisms (such as different laughter or intonation) that seem out of character, potentially picked up from someone else they’re frequently around.
	
        3.	Subtle Changes in Music, TV, or Food Preferences:
A sudden change in tastes—like listening to a certain artist nonstop, watching shows you’ve never heard them mention before, or preparing unfamiliar dishes—could reflect someone else’s influence.
	
        4.	Atypical Interest in Self-Help or Relationship Advice Materials (Without Discussing It With You):
They might start reading relationship books or listening to personal growth podcasts, not to share insights with you, but perhaps due to guilt, confusion, or an external suggestion.
	
        5.	Becoming Overly Accommodating in Some Areas and More Dismissive in Others:
They might suddenly become extra helpful or generous in ways that seem forced (cooking elaborate meals, buying unexpected gifts) while simultaneously brushing off or avoiding meaningful conversations.
	
        6.	Avoidance of Sharing Future Plans or Long-Term Goals:
Someone who previously enjoyed discussing vacations, home renovations, or family events may now sidestep talk about the future, feeling uncertain or conflicted due to a hidden relationship.
	
        7.	Erratic Mood Improvements After ‘Breaks’ or Time Away:
They return from a trip out—running errands, gym sessions, or coffee breaks—displaying an unexplained boost in mood and energy that doesn’t align with the stated activity.
	
        8.	Strange Gaps in Their Personal Narrative:
Consistent “I don’t remember” or vague explanations about certain parts of their day, or stories that always end right before what you’d expect to hear next.
	
        9.	Non-Specific Hostility or Impatience:
Instead of classic distance, they may show more irritability or impatience with minor things, potentially out of guilt or stress over maintaining a secret.
	
        10.	Changes in Attention to Digital Privacy or Personal Data Sharing:
Beyond hiding their phone or changing passwords, they might become strangely protective of calendar entries, social media friend lists, or even innocuous email newsletters—subtle shifts in what they choose to keep private.

	11.	Newfound Emotional Reserve or Hesitation in Conversations They Once Enjoyed:
They might no longer volunteer stories about their day, favorite hobbies, or mutual friends, as if they’re compartmentalizing their life.
	
        12.	Uncharacteristic Investment in Appearance Only Outside the Home:
They may not bother to dress nicely or groom themselves when with you, but show meticulous attention to detail before leaving, even for routine errands.
	
        13.	Overly Specific Complaints About You or the Relationship:
Criticisms may shift from general (“We don’t talk enough”) to oddly detailed (“You never smile at the dinner table anymore”), reflecting new comparisons or standards formed elsewhere.
	
        14.	A Noticeable Pause Before Answering Routine Questions:
Simple queries like “How was your afternoon?” may cause them to hesitate, as if they’re mentally filtering or editing what to share.
	
        15.	Increased Interest in Their Own Privacy While Not Respecting Yours:
They may insist on personal boundaries—locking their social media, guarding their phone—while showing less concern for your comfort or information.
	
        16.	More Frequent Mention of a ‘Busy Period’ or ‘Stress at Work’ Without Clear Evidence:
They talk about long hours, pressing deadlines, or challenging colleagues, yet cannot provide any concrete examples or outcomes from all this extra effort.
	
        17.	Shifts in Sleep Patterns Not Explained by Lifestyle Changes:
Suddenly staying up much later than usual (online, on their phone) or waking unusually early may create private windows of communication with someone else.
	
        18.	Becoming Vague About Financial Details:
Changes in spending habits—strange credit card charges, secretive handling of bills—without any corresponding explanation or visible purchase might point to undisclosed outings or gifts.
	
        19.	Distancing From Your Social Circle or Family Without a Stated Reason:
They may have enjoyed attending gatherings with your friends or family but now avoid them. This could be out of guilt or fear of being questioned.
	
        20.	Showing Unexplained Sensitivity to Certain Locations or Situations:
They might react oddly when you suggest going to a particular café, store, or part of town, quickly steering you away or appearing nervous for no clear reason.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gvdn7c/aita_for_telling_my_brother_to_stop_coming/)**: November 19, 2024**

My brother, Chris (27M fake name), moved in with my BF (28M) and I (26F) 7 years ago. We took pity on him after he was kicked out of my childhood home for drug use and was sleeping in his car. At first, chris and my boyfriend got along great. After a few years of living together chris became more reclusive and distant from us both. Chores were not being done around the house and I was getting sick of cleaning up after him and his negative attitude. Six months prior to the end of our lease I told Chris that he had to find another living situation. He did finally move out a few weeks prior to the end of our lease and i thought we all agreed about splitting up shared appliances and valuables. One thing we did not discuss was our shared robot mopping device. We acquired this one day at my grandmother's house a few years ago. She was moving and offered it to all three of us as she would not be using it. So we brought that little robot home! This thing is nothing fancy, just a small device you fill with cleaning solution and attach disposable mop pads. Let me be clear, in the 4 years we have had this thing Chris has not ONCE paid for any replacement moping pads. NEVER had even turned the thing on. It was always BF or I splitting the cost of pads and setting this thing up to run nightly so we'd all wake up to clean floors downstairs.

Chris hasn't returned his key because he's still slowly moving things out. It's been over a month now. He always showed up unannounced to our home to gather boxes and his belongings. Sometimes we wouldn't even realize he was there while we had been out.

Last night BF was looking for our little robot friend as we had just gotten new pads delivered for it. Turns out after going crazy looking for this thing and texting Chris he did take it, claiming ""yeah, he is mine"". This was the last straw. We had been so accommodating to this man for years. I just can't believe Chris had the AUDACITY to take our beloved robotic cleaning friend without a word. I have let Chris know that we are no longer comfortable with him coming by unannounced and if he needs anything we will look for it ourselves. I also said he can return his key to the office and we will pick it up. His response? ""Stop being weird i dont want any of your trash shit i already had all my useful grow equipment stolen anyways stop texting me before you make me mad"" (The grow stuff referred to here is indoor greenhouse and hydroponics. Which was verbally agreed for an even split of materials since both Chris and BF acquired the equipment together.) BF ordered a camera that will be here tomorrow, I've contacted the leasing office to make them aware of the animosity between us and requested the locks to be changed. I just want to know, am I going to far? This robot is not at all expensive, but it's more about the principle to me. I feel disrespected. We all have to see eachother next week for Thanksgiving and i know it will be awkward. Update posted in comments.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: NTA

Your freeloading brother took the final step over the line.

>**OOP:** I appreciate your reply, thanks for taking the time to read. I agree he's a freeloader and an arrogant one at that.

*Living situation:*

>He's officially moved out more than a month ago now, and has his own new residence.  
Also, we have only been staying at this townhouse for one year and a month. We had all moved out together from our previous living situation.

*The robot:*

>Additional Information: We absolutely loved this robot. One of my BF and my favorite pass times was to get stoned and watch this little guy go back and forth cleaning our floors. I almost feel like this was intentionally taken from us to prevent enjoyment and as an intentional inconvenience.

Commenter: you took in a drug user.what did you expect?

>**OOP:** I thought I had almost lost my brother, so that had probably clouded my judgment.  
It was an unintentional overdose from a laced substance, was supposed to be just psilocybin. At least that's what I was told.

*Did HE tell you?*

>Hey told me the story of being kicked out, but it was corroborate by my mom and siblings. It does seem like he didn't realize what the substance actually was, but i guess play stupid games win stupid prizes fits.

Commenter: has he ever taken any responsibilty for what got him kicked out or was it never his fault? what kind of housemate was he?bf was very patient cause thats a lot of drama noone needs.have you apologized to bf for disrupting his home?

>**OOP:** The main reason we wanted him to move out was space for BF and I as a couple. We're planning engagement soon and want to move on with our own lives. He was quite weird to live with, especially towards the end.. didn't clean up the mess on the stove or coffee area after himself. I don't think he took out the trash once, and I had to ask. I have apologized to my BF for letting this go on for so long, but I should really put a note or something together for him. Thanks!  
I see what you actually mean by getting kicked out, and yes, he fully admitted that he was at fault for the drugs. As far as I know he doesn't do hard drugs, only legal weed and psychedelics.

Commenter: Your brother's an a$$hole who seems to have some entitlement and anger management issues. I'd go no contact with him asap.

>**OOP:** We were low contact as it was while LIVING together. We hardly spoke at all and he would walk in and ignore us, no hello or goodbye.

Commenter: Please tell me you charged him some sort of rent.

>**OOP:** Oh yes, originally we all stayed in BFs childhood home and we didn't have rent so he didn't either. But when we all moved on to rented spaces he did contribute 1/3.

*What does he want with the robot anyway?*

>He only wants the moppimg robot now that he ""has hardwood floors now"". But we've always lived in a house where this robot was useful, he just didn't want to contribute to our shared space. He also had the audactity to say his contributions to cleaning the floor was the robot itself.. that was given to us and he did not pay for??

Update: I decided to reach out to my brother and ask him nicely to bring our robot friend to Thanksgiving so we can bring him back home. Here's the messages so far:

Me- I've gotten some time to think about this and gotten some different perspectives. I don't believe the robot belongs to you, I'd really appreciate if you could bring it with you to Thanksgiving so we can bring it back home. I feel as though we've been very accommodating to you over the years you've lived with us, and taking a shared appliance without any discussion is not only disrespectful but shows your lack of consideration for us. So we'd like our robot back, since really he is ours after years of using and upkeeping without any help from you.

Chris- I’ve gotten some time to think about it and I want the TV from grandmas as well so go ahead and bring it over when you get a chance thanks

Me- TV was also given to us specifically I'm not sure why you think that's yours as well?

Chris-Everything was given to you apparently She asked me if i wanted the robot while I was in the kitchen and I said yes thats how it went end of story i dont give 2 shits what you think is yours or not if I let you borrow something because im not using it it doesnt make it yours

Me-As I remember it, we were all there at the time she offered. And I even tried to decline since it's still useful but she insisted. It was given to all of us as a shared household. If you thought it was yours, you should have had a discussion with us first before taking it while we were out.

Chris-You remember wrong and I dont need to have a discussion about my own things. Not to mention BF moving shady taking shit out of the tent while I was gone thinking I wouldnt notice lol how is that any different? I didnt bring it up because im a bigger person and dont really care anymore I want to put this terrible part of my life behind me and if you dont leave it be Im going to leave you behind as well.

Me-You and BF had a discussion about splitting up the grow stuff which he thought went amicably. You aren't being very mature and I don't want someone that can't have a simple conversation about shared items in my life anyways.

So I guess that's it, looks we will not be getting our little friend back. Thank you all for your support and interacting with this post. This was my second post ever, and to see it blow up was a crazy feeling!

*2 hours later:*

Actually... after the convo BF just had with him we might be seeing our friend again soon. Look out next Thursday for an update!!

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1h2rg8y/update_aita_for_telling_my_brother_to_stop_coming/)**: November 29, 2024 (10 days from OG post)**

Hello again! I just wanted to start by saying thank you all for your judgments on my last post. I read every comment and gave each perspective some thought. Ultimately you guys helped me gain the confidence to stand up for myself and ask for our robot back! I included my text conversation with my brother Chris in the comments of my last post. To summarize, I asked as politely as I could for our mopping robot back as well as stated the reasonings why it belonged to us. Chris refused to see reason and pretty much said he would be cutting me out of his life if I kept bringing this up. My wonderful BF couldn't sit back and let him be disrespectful to us anymore. He had his own conversation with Chris, which for privacy reasons cannot be shared. BF ended up taking some of your guys advice and threatened to reveal specific information to our family if our robot was not returned on Thanksgiving. This was last Thursday, so he had one week to make a decision.

After a quiet week I was preparing myself to drop a bomb on family dinner. But then, I went out to start warming up my car Wednesday night and there was a box on my front step. I didn't order anything and as I picked up the box noticed it wasn't sealed.

GUYS OUR ROBOT FRIEND FOUND HIS WAY HOME!

I guess Chris decided that a mopping robot was not worth ruining his reputation with our family. He will not be bothering us anymore, and we will be low/no contact from now on.

Now a positive from all this drama! BF and I are utilizing our new home monitoring cameras to watch our pets. Our dogs and cats activities while home alone are so entertaining it's brought us a lot of joy to check in on them. Family photo will be posted in comments of pets and robot!

Have a great holiday season everyone!

I've reached a point where I knew deep in my heart that I had to quit. I wasn't getting enough energy or focus to do anything. I was always tired, sleeping late, waking up later, compulsory nap throughout the day, drink a shitton of coffee to compensate for the lack of sleep... I was miserable. I got so dependent to the point that my brain wasn't even braining anymore in a job where I had to use it quite often. It truly felt terrible. 

I took a Friday off around that time and I heard the audio book of Alan Carr's Easyway of quitting smoking. The book has a lot of substance and value in it, but what really stuck with me and what really kept me going and the main message i got from that book is this. 

We love incorporating habits that make us feel good. The easier the habit is to engage in, the easier it can be assimilated in our routine and daily life. Our brains are very good at justifying these new habits and behaviors. Our capacity for human intellect is effectively our blessing and curse at the same time. We tend to create justifications for shitty behaviors out of thin air (very important point). Let me give you an example. 

* I woke up late, ouh, I feel shitty, let me smoke to feel better and actually wake up
* I just had coffee, caffeine is great for mental sharpness, nicotine will only accentuate that effect, time for a cig
* I just had lunch, won't be complete until I smoke 
* I just walked my dog, feeling kinda tired, time to smoke 
* I'm playing my favorite videogame, I'm having fun, time to smoke so that I may feel even better 

  
You see what's going on there? The act of smoking and whatever it is that you're attaching it to are 2 completely separate events, they do not relate to each other, nicotine will never make u feel more woken up, it won't make your gaming experience better, it won't give you mental sharpness, it won't do any of that, BUT your brain is good at associating any type of events that happen with its favorite substance. And that's what you get. Once you deeply realize that nicotine is not necessary to live your life, that indeed, it won't fix your problem, it's not the solution, it won't add anything to the equation but actually make it worse, **once you truly wrap your head around that** that's when it becomes easy to quit, at least according to my experience and Alan Carr's. 

What will further embrace this realization is actually how fucking bad nicotine makes you feel, I can still remember the misery of a life I was living when I was smoking. 

I have no desire to go back, and this time it just feels very different, it's like something deep in my brain changed and there's no going back. When I quit it in the past, I'd still crave it, I'd still reminisce about it, I'd yearn for it and miss it, but now, it just disgusts me, it feels unnecessary, uncalled for, depraving and destrying. 

I have so many other things to say on the matter.  ",2,1733460742.0,quittingsmoking,1,1.0,False

Dishes have ALWAYS been adhd enemy number one. 

You know the “everything has a place, and it goes back in its place when you’re done with it every time so things don’t get lost and so the house stays clean” thing we all struggle with? Making sure everything *has* a place has really helped me as I’ve settled into living alone and having freedom to do what I want/need these last few years. I plan to apply this (everything has a place) to dishes now that the dishwasher is here!!!

Where do dirty dishes go? They go in  the dishwasher, that’s their place!!! I plan to run the dishwasher every night or at least every other, then I’ll empty the dishwasher in the morning. I have, like, no dopamine most mornings… but I saw a girl on Instagram saying that she EMPTIES IT WHILE HER COFFEE BREWS AND THEN SHE GETS A LITTLE TREAT/REWARD: COFFEE!! Coffee and my cat are, like, the only reason I get out of bed sooooo I think that’s gonna work for me. Plus it gives me 5 minutes to try to beat the timer so my coffee doesn’t get cold, which helps me stay focused on one task and not get distracted by other things that need doing. 

Anyone else have a countertop dishwasher? I’ve seen some posts here about them over the last few years that I’ve wanted one. Anything I need to know to increase its longevity? It was like $300 that I can’t really afford (why I waited literally years) but the piles of dishes are too much, it’s time to take care of myself and provide an accommodation I REALLY need. Since it’s expensive and an important tool for me, I want to make sure I take care of it and make it last. Like, does it matter for the life of the machine if I rinse dishes first? Because if I could just throw them in it’d be great, but if I need to rinse first I’ll make it a habit. ",3,1733460560.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I don’t smoke or do drugs, but I love a good cup of coffee, the occasional drink, and staying active. When I’m not working, I’m usually diving into something exciting—scuba diving, riding motorcycles, experimenting in the kitchen, or taking on a DIY project (I renovated my entire house solo!). I also enjoy woodworking, boating, binge-watching a great show, and spending time with family. Living a healthy, active lifestyle matters to me, and I’d love to find someone who feels the same.

I’m a 38-year-old fit guy who’s looking to meet someone special for a meaningful connection, adventure, and lots of laughs. A little about me:  

Fitness-focused: Staying active is a big part of my life, whether it’s hitting the gym, hiking, or exploring new ways to keep moving. Bonus points if you’re into staying active too!  

Passionate about the outdoors: I love nature—whether it’s a quiet walk in the woods, a weekend road trip, or just appreciating a good sunrise with coffee in hand. 

Curious and ambitious: I’m always striving to grow and learn. I’m the kind of person who enjoys deep conversations about life and its many layers.  

What I’m looking for:  
- Someone who values honesty, humor, and is ready to build a genuine connection.  
- A partner who’s open to exploring life’s adventures, whether that’s as simple as a great dinner or as exciting as trying something new.  
- Someone who can match my energy but also appreciates downtime when it’s needed.  

If this sounds like something you’re looking for, drop me a message or tell me something about yourself—what you love, what makes you tick, or even your favorite random fact!

Couple of days back I took an immediate decision to slightly change analysis and presentation for client team meeting (clearly mentioned changes and rationale to client 3-4 hours ahead of meeting)

Then, in my night (US morning) I got a slew of angry messages from client in Teams channel where my other team members can also see messages. Client chose harshest of corporate acceptable words.

I was confused (since I had explained everything clearly well in advance) and also the change was. Very small, they wouldn't have noticed if I did not mention it. I apologized for perceived communication miss  and redo all the slides to revert to original analysis.

3 hours later I got a call from the client, telling me that they went ahead with my updated analysis!! also mentioned that he didn't mean those words and that's not how he like to work. He also deleted his harsh messages from teams chat.

But I am finding it extremely difficult to move on from the incidence. I literally cried in bathroom that night. I was peeled in front of my team, juniors, colleagues.

Now I have following questions:

1. Why do low cost/ outsource employees treated as expandable punching bags? At client side they make biggers mess in different teams, that we identify and sometime also resolve later in nights. 


2. Why can't US/EU clients treat Indians as human beings of similar human limitations?

We take calls well late in nights 9,10 pm IST (EST morning) when they come well relaxed a good breakfast, cup of coffee while we are already in 11th hour of slogging, most likely in our 5th call of the day, then they expect use to brainstorm complex business situations and present solution on the go!!!! 

3. When something is required later in the week or timelines can be pushed, why don't we get the courtesy of logging off early and put our kids to bed, or least have dinner with family?

4. If team is logged off, then how can they think it's okay to send us request and expect response immediately?

I am exhausted being an inferior counterpart, who get just a ""Thank you for all the hard work"" after weeks of late night, acidity filled coffee drinks, anxiety, panic attacks.

I am done being an outsourced employee

I am done being treated as a slave

I am done not seeing my daughter whole day

I am going to put in my papers. Will try to do something as a freelance.

Recently, I posted on Facebook about wanting to meet new people and share hobbies since I’ve been in a new country for a year now. A woman reached out to me and invited me for a walk at her usual spot.

We had a great conversation, discussing relationships, business, politics, and personal topics. She even opened up about her past relationships, including being cheated on (something I asked about in the flow of the conversation).

After the walk, she invited me to her place for coffee/tea, and we had coffee there as well.

Now, here’s where I’m confused: I’m interested in her romantically because I admire her thoughts, ideas, and how she views life. I told her about my interest over WhatsApp, but I’m unsure if she sees me as just a friend or if she’s also interested romantically.

What do you think? Could her actions (inviting me for a walk, having coffee at her place, and sharing personal stories) indicate romantic interest, or is this just her being friendly? How should I proceed without making things awkward?

Timeline:

* Nov 21 - Started AR's Udemy course. When I got to the part about how to apply I started writing up my PM experience. Continued to add/edit as I finished the course since the material would remind me of things I'd done in projects.
* Nov 25 - Finished the course and immediately applied to write the PMP exam. Was easy to just plop in the experience I'd written up.
* Studied a lot with Joseph Phillips' practice exams but I don't recommend them. Questions were suspect and a bunch of material was tested that freaked me out because it wasn't in AR's course. Ultimately none of that stuff was on the exam either, so my time researching it was wasted.
* Nov 30 - Application approved, weird that it was approved on a Saturday but I got the Black Friday discount for the exam and SH so that was great. Scheduled my exam for earliest available time (Dec 4).
* Read through all of Third3Rock's notes in a day, then wrote the first SH practice exam the next morning. The notes brought it all together so well, they were my favorite resource. Got 85% in the practice exam and I knew I was golden for the real thing.
* Dec 3 - Day before exam day. Tried to follow the same procedure as my SH practice exam by reading all of Third3Rock's notes the day before. Slight hiccup though, got an interview that day (yay!) so my focus was split. Not too bad but turned into more of a skim of the notes.
* Dec 4 - Exam at noon. Let my body wake up on it's own (no alarm) and did no brain work in the morning. Just coffee, a little walk, and an early lunch. Got to the exam center at 11:30 and they seemed annoyed that I was there early even though their instructions say to get there 30 minutes before exam time. Took both breaks and had some light snacks. 10 minutes goes by FAST and it takes time to get checked out and back in, so realistically you have like 5 minutes per break. Don't dawdle or you lose exam time.
* Exam end screen doesn't give you results, just got a printout that I had a provisional pass. Next day (\~24 hours after exam) got the email with full results breakdown.

Advice:

* Reading exam questions for 4 hours is exhausting. Don't try to study the day of the exam or you won't have the brain power left to focus on the questions.
* Third3Rock notes and Study Hall exams are the best resources. Review the sections of any questions you get wrong or mark as low confidence.
* Take your breaks but make it quick. 10 minutes shrinks to 5 with the check out/check in process.",19,1733458655.0,pmp,6,1.0,False

25/f

Been working since age 16- before that I babysat here and there- but have worked in grocery stores, butcher shops, summer camps, digital customer service, various student jobs in undergrad, and now work in journalism (local TV station, digital side of things).

To make things simple- I like work- I like feeling useful- I like writing- I like researching- I like reading. Most importantly, I like the idea of securing a life for myself that enables a stable retirement, the ability to see the world (at a realistic and fiscally conservative rate), and the ability to buy an overpriced coffee without guilt.

I have arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, a neuromusculoskeletal condition that, though I did not realize it until now, truly puts a limit on what I am able to do with my life.

As a child, I dreamed of joining the Navy and seeing the world while working hard and enjoying the benefits that veterans are offered- unfortunately I cannot do a push-up.

I can't be a server or bartender (disability stuff).

Then I wanted to be an English teacher, then a history professor- but the schooling/payoff ratio did not seem worthwhile,

I wanted to work in Forensics, but the loan debt/payoff ratio (something which my Dad loved to tell me about) steered me away.

I have a communication/broadcasting degree. I don't want to work in news forever, and I am so grateful for the $40K I make. I am grateful- but I want more.

I know I need some more years of work experience- but It just feels like the track is laid for a life that I wasn't even aware that I signed up for.

I've considered law school, but my uGPA sucks. I don't know where to go from here. I want a better life for myself and my future family.

Maybe this post is pointless and without meaning, and if this was a waste of your time, I apologize. ",1,1733458591.0,findapath,2,1.0,False
