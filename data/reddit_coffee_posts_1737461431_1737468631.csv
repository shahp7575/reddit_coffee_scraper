sertraline 50mgs, propranolol extended release 80mgs, levothyroxine 25mgs, cetirizine (don't know the dose but once or twice daily), HRT - progesterone and oestrogen 

Supplements iron spray, vitamin D and K spray and the coq10

POTS / ME / CFS / MCAS / known bigimeny and trigimeny and short NSVT runs. 

Structurally normal echo and normal stress test summer 2023 and normal MRI summer 2019. 


Im a bit concerned because I've just had the longest run of NSVT I've ever had, it was about 5 or 6 beats when the longest I've had was 3. 

I'm pretty sure it was NSVT and not SVT due to the way it felt and it felt the same as my NSVT that's been captured on recording before but obviously I can't be certain. 

Sudden onset and sudden offset with a few single skipped beats in the minutes after (which makes me think it's even more likely to be NSVT). Felt like a fluttering in my heart. 

I started coq10 enzyme (100mgs coq10 and 0.17mgs thiamine) about 4 days ago because I have been sleeping through the day alot and feeling exhausted. Though I did skip today's dose as I was out. 

And the last few days I've had more energy than I have in months. 

Today I had a whole day where I didn't need to sleep at all but this evening I have been feeling like I have too much energy (wired) and feel hot and a bit like I'm on fire and like I can't settle down. It's 2am and I'm nowhere near sleep. I have felt like my heart is beating faster and more strongly since I started on the coq10. I feel basically like I've had a coffee but I avoid caffeine so don't. 

So yeah I was just laying on my back in bed and it came on. 

I'm wondering if it could be being caused by the coq10 enzyme or related to an interaction with any tablets or supplements I'm taking. 

I do have a history of increased skipped beats with alot of tablets including vitamin D and magnesium especially and that's why we started me on a baby dose of levothyroxine but I've only ever had NSVT 3 times I'm aware of including this one 😬

Before I go running to my cardiologist and bothering him I just wanted people's thoughts on coq10 as a possible cause. 

Long term monitoring except a loop recorder would be pointless as luckily these events so rarely happen but I am concerned that each time I have had one it's increased in length and Im wondering if that's a reason alone to see my cardiologist. 

I will obviously stop the coq10 but would it even be still in my system if I last had it 33 hours prior to me having this run of beats now. 

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated as I don't want to run to my cardiologist if it's not necessary.

Hey guys, 

Wife and I enjoy a good coffee on the weekends and when we work from home. We drink black only (right now brewing coffee in cup). But after moving in a new house, considering finally a set up with machine.
Don’t want any milk stuff (I want a slim machine with not a lot of cleaning). 
Grinder is on separate budget (she has no clue how much those are in I will sneak it in ;))
For guests (her family is big on coffee), we will remain for the brew in cup method 

Located in EU, espresso / americano only.
Budget 500-1000
Mostly weekends / rarely guests to entertain with coffee from machine
First serious Machine
Space could be an issue, the smaller the better but open to adapt my layout

I lied about being in a higher role than I actually am and the guilt has been eating me alive. My parents and one close friend know that I am not in this role. In fact, I just now earned my degree. I pretended to go to work the past 6 months so no one would catch on but in reality I was going to libraries/coffee shops to work on my online classes. I know it’s awful that I lied and this sounds a little insane, but if I hadn’t taken off work I know I would have never completed those classes.

I go through an on-the-job training that lasts for a few months (clinical experience) and while I am thrilled I would love some emotional support from those who are close to me. It’s a horrible combination of feeling proud of myself for doing the work and overwhelming guilt for lying. 

I’m not sure how to navigate this situation. I could come clean to my friends but I don’t want that to ruin our relationships. I do understand actions have consequences though and I should not have lied. Otherwise, I could continue with this lie until I actually earn the title of the job I said that I already have.

I'm preparing for this really, really important life-changing exam of my life and there are only 3 months left but I feel so depressed.. please- like I'm not that lazy to spend months doing nothing. Previously, a few months ago, I was studying like 8 hours everyday but right now, i can't even bring myself to get out of bed but I still force myself. I get up at 7 every morning. First thing, I clean my room and set up my table and take a shower because I cannot study when I feel dirty. I do everything. I even take care of the smallest things that might distract me but I then go and sit at my table and ...nothing. It's not even burn out because it feels even worse. I really hate it. It feels like there is this heavy feeling in my chest and I feel so repulsed by my books. I can't even describe it, it's a very strong feeling like sitting on lava..I open my laptop and try to focus, focus, focus but there's this very very strong feeling to close it and just not do anything at all. I don't even have any social media, try not to use youtube even but it's like I'm doing so much preparation only to end up doing nothing.
I have thus very weird mindset towards life these days. It's like nothing's gonna change even if I did get into med school, I'll still have to grind a LOT. So, I'm just stuck in this stupid loop of grinding to grind more and more. I don't know how anyone else not feels this way? It's like everyone else is gaslighting themselves and I'm so fed up with manipulating myself..I dont want this. Why do I have to waste my only chance at consciousness in this stupid capitalist dystopia? I see everything through a negative light and it's like I feel every negative emotion times 3. Why's life so fucking unfair to me because I've worked so so hard and I'm definitely going to fail this exam and everything will be wasted because I'll be on the same level as those who do nothing. And even if I do crack the exam, med school is going to kill me. I'm not even meant for it but i literally have no other option. No amount of money would change how much I hate this world and I don't even care about this. Like, why should i even work hard? I don't care about money and would rather live my life my own way but my parents hate me so much. Everytime they look at me, Even if they're nice, i can feel how much they despise me. 

Please. How can I study despite all these stupid thoughts? I am so deeply dissatisfied with my life and spend most of my life having random breakdowns in my room. I even abandoned my friends and everyone. I hate how I could just end it in 2 hours and save myself a life's worth of suffering but I'm a literal coward. I see no future for myself and I don't even see myself in my future. Maybe I'd once find the courage to do it but like do you notice this? It's like the entire world, all the supernatural and natural forces are against me. Also, i have this weird notion that i can't do anything unless my brain is completely quiet, like a blank slate..So, I abandoned everyone but my thoughts are still so loud sometimes even when im not caffeinated. Like i wish i could put my hands on my ears and stop that. I have so many weird 'notions' like I can't study without cleaning every corner of my room or that If I don't  have coffee, i can't study (even though I very well can). Like I'm not saying I have OCD because I'm not diagnosed at all and I'm not going to self diagnose but I have so many compulsions very often. ",1,1737468159.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1i6j7u9,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1i6j7u9/magnifica_s_and_supermarket_beans_cant_reconcile/,"Magnifica S and supermarket beans, can't reconcile brew time and coffee not being too bitter","The common wisdom here, so far from everything I've read, much of it in regard to De'Longhi (not Magnifica S mostly though):

\- set temperature to highest

\- measure beans used and determine yield by 1:3 to 1:4 ratio for superautomatic of this type

\- set grind size to the lowest one where the stream is not dripping and there is no clogging

I have done this. \~10g of beans, 30-40mil shots, grind size 1.5 (it does not clog at this).

The ""issues"" I am having:

lots of people use brew duration as a measure for quality of extraction. They say 15sec at the minimum, 20sec ideally.

But at the settings I said, just above the grind size where it clogs, and with yields 1:3 or 1:4, the brew duration is still at most \~13-14sec.

Now, the brew duration itself, I could not care less about, so long as the taste was good. But it's not. It IS stronger, but less pleasant compared to a coarser grind (2.5), more beans (maximum, \~13g) and shorter brew duration (\~11-12sec).

Now, I am not very refined in coffee. So my beans are supermarket beans, value, as is my machine. So basically I am just trying to see if I can do better within those parameters. So long as it's equal or slightly better compared to Nespresso, that is fine by me..

I did try with slightly better commercial coffee, like Lavazza, but it's the same scenario. My next step up is like the cheapest specialty roaster beans.",1,1737468106.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

1i6j7ga,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1i6j7ga/diy_furniture_upcycling/,DIY Furniture Upcycling,"Ah, the thrilling world of secondhand furniture—the arena where old becomes new again, and something downright shabby can end up as the crown jewel of your living room. It’s like being a superhero for furniture. You find treasures hidden in plain sight, breathe new life into them, and send them off to their next adventure. Let’s dive into brainstorming how to source, refurbish, and then sell these fabulous finds, all without breaking the bank—or your back!

### Sourcing Used Furniture

1. **Thrift Stores and Charity Shops:**
   Always keep an eye out for local thrift stores or charity shops. They can be like treasure troves filled with pieces waiting for someone with a vision (that’s you!). Plus, every dollar spent often goes toward a great cause, and that’s a win-win.

2. **Garage Sales and Estate Sales:**
   These are the quintessential hunting grounds for hidden gems. Wake up early, grab a coffee, and chat with the sellers. You might score some amazing bargains and great stories!

3. **Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist:**
   Here’s where the magic happens. Set your alerts to get notified when things pop up in your area. Be prepared to negotiate like a pro and don’t forget the all-important “Can you deliver?” question.

4. **Local Buy Nothing Groups:**
   This is where people give away items rather than sell them. It’s incredible what some folks are willing to part with just because they want to declutter. You could snag a couch that just needs a little love.

5. **Flea Markets:**
   A day at a flea market can be like a mini-vacation. It’s fun, bustling with activity, and filled with potential finds. Plus, it’s a great place to meet like-minded DIY enthusiasts.

### Refurbishing Techniques

1. **Painting and Distressing:**
   A fresh coat of paint can work miracles. For some rustic charm, try distressing the edges to reveal the wood underneath. It’s like giving a tired piece a little spa treatment mixed with a makeover montage from a feel-good movie.

2. **Reupholstering:**
   If you’re feeling adventurous, grab some vibrant fabric and a staple gun. Reupholstering can give an old chair or sofa a brand-new personality. Plus, you’ll look super impressive when you tell friends you did it yourself!

3. **Staining or Refinishing Wood:**
   A beautiful stain can highlight the natural beauty of the wood. It’s like putting the finishing touches on a masterpiece. Sand it down, apply some stain, and watch the transformation happen like magic.

4. **Adding New Hardware:**
   Sometimes, all it takes is a simple change—like swapping out tired old knobs for shiny new ones. It’s the equivalent of giving your dresser a whole new wardrobe. 

5. **DIY Décor Accents:**
   Consider adding fun stencils, decals, or even a little decoupage to personalize your pieces. It’s where your creative juices can flow, and you can let your personality shine through.

### Selling Through Facebook Marketplace or Etsy

1. **High-Quality Photos:**
   No one wants to buy a sad-looking piece of furniture. Bright, well-lit, and inviting photos can make all the difference. Show off all angles and any unique features. It’s like having a little photoshoot for your furniture!

2. **Compelling Descriptions:**
   Use vivid adjectives and tell a little story about the piece. Describe its charm, the time it was built, or the transformation it went through. Make your potential buyers feel the emotional connection—like falling in love at first sight.

3. **Pricing Strategically:**
   Research similar listings to find the sweet spot for your price. Remember, the goal is to make a profit while being fair to the buyer. Consider offering incentives for local pick-up to save on shipping costs.

4. **Engage with Your Audience:**
   If you're listing on Facebook Marketplace, respond quickly to inquiries and be friendly. Like, truly think ""customer service superstar."" Building rapport could lead to future sales or referrals.

5. **Utilizing Etsy’s Niche:**
   For unique, handcrafted, or refurbished items, Etsy is a fantastic platform. Make sure to tell your story; people are often willing to pay a bit more for something that has a narrative behind it. 

### Wrap Up

Diving into the world of secondhand furniture can be incredibly rewarding, both creatively and financially. Plus, transforming something that’s been tossed aside into functional art is a beautiful metaphor for life, isn’t it? We are all a bit like old furniture—sometimes we need a little refurbishing to shine brightly once again. So gather your tools, your favorite playlist, and maybe a friend or two to join in the fun.

Some of my favourite examples :

Dedra - working late into the night with her assistant, trying to find the evidence she needs to connect the various stolen pieces. We see her popping a couple of pills. Maybe just paracetamol for a headache or perhaps stimulant pills to keep her going. Either way - extremely relatable, and also humanising of a character we genuinely root for right up until when we see just how horrifyingly appalling she really is. 

Brasso calling out to Cassian “ …and tell your mother she can afford to put the heating on – it was freezing there last night!” This tells us just as much about Brasso and Cassian as it does about the harshness of life on Ferrix. Brasso, concerned and nurturing. Cassian, thoughtlessly neglectful. Brasso wearily accepting Cassian’s need for the alibi but throwing in a bit of “your mama” humour that also shows how close they are. 

Bix, the morning after her unenthusiastic booty call, saying to Timm “Tell me you have caf…?” Not just being very relatable in a “ I need morning coffee to function!” kind of way but also suggesting the relative newness (and therefore fragility) of their relationship. If she had spent the night here before or often, she would know whether he is a caf drinker and wouldn’t need to ask this.

I don’t think there’s a wasted line or action in the whole season. What are your favourite details of these kinds?

**ANNAPOLIS, MD  (January 20, 2025)—**  The Maryland Department of Agriculture announced the first presumptive positive case of H5 avian influenza in a commercial broiler farm in Dorchester County. This is the fourth case of highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza (HPAI) on a commercial poultry farm on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. Confirmation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) is pending with final results anticipated in the coming days.

This new case arises just six days after a presumptive positive result was identified at a commercial poultry farm in Caroline County. In total, there are now seven commercial operations in the Delmarva region confirmed to have HPAI, including two premises in Kent County, Delaware, and one premises in Accomack County, Virginia. 

State officials have quarantined all affected premises, and birds on the properties are being or have been depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from affected flocks will not enter the food system.

Confirmation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory is pending with final results anticipated in the coming days.   

Avian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among birds through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. This virus affects poultry, like chickens, ducks, and turkeys, along with some wild bird species such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and raptors.

According to the Maryland Department of Health, the risk of transmission between birds and the general public is low. Those who work directly with poultry or dairy farms may be more at risk and should follow key biosecurity practices. 

The Maryland Department of Agriculture continues to urge growers and backyard flock owners to enhance biosecurity practices and become familiar with what to do if HPAI is suspected in a flock. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention share more [guidance here.](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/prevention/worker-protection-ppe.html)

* **Look for signs of illness.** Know the [warning signs](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/defend-the-flock/signs-illness) of infectious bird diseases.
* **Report suspected sick birds:**
* To report a possible case of HPAI in a commercial or backyard flock, call the Maryland Department of Agriculture at 410-841-5810.  
* Commercial chicken growers and backyard flock owners can email questions about the outbreak to [MD.Birdflu@maryland.gov](mailto:MD.Birdflu@maryland.gov).
* To report a sick wild bird in Maryland, call the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Wildlife Services hotline at (877) 463-6497 between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. 

Key biosecurity practices:  

* **Clean and disinfect transportation**. Don’t walk through or drive trucks, tractors, or equipment in areas where waterfowl or other wildlife feces may be. If you can’t avoid this, clean your shoes, vehicle, and equipment thoroughly to prevent bringing disease agents back to your flock.  This is especially important when visiting with farmers or those who hunt wildfowl such as when gathering at a local coffee shop, restaurant, or gas station.  
* **Remove loose feed.** Don’t give wild birds, rodents, and insects a free lunch. Remove spilled or uneaten feed right away, and make sure feed storage units are secure and free of holes. Wild birds can carry HPAI.
* **Keep visitors to a minimum.** Only allow those people who take care of your poultry to come in contact with your birds,  including family and friends. Make sure everyone who has contact with your flock follows biosecurity principles.
* **Wash your hands before and after coming in contact with live poultry.**  Wash with soap and water. If using a hand sanitizer, first remove manure, feathers, and other materials from your hands because disinfectants will not penetrate organic matter or caked-on dirt.
* **Provide disposable boot covers (preferred) and/or disinfectant footbaths for anyone having contact with your flock.** If using a footbath, be sure to remove all droppings, mud, or debris from boots and shoes using a long-handled scrub brush BEFORE stepping into the disinfectant footbath, and always keep it clean. 
* **Change clothes before entering poultry areas and before exiting the property.** Visitors should wear protective outer garments or disposable coveralls, boots, and headgear when handling birds, and shower and/or change clothes when leaving the facility.  
* **Clean and disinfect tools or equipment before moving them to a new poultry facility.** Before allowing vehicles, trucks, tractors, or tools and equipment—including egg flats and cases that have come in contact with birds or their droppings—to exit the property, make sure they are cleaned and disinfected to prevent contaminated equipment from transporting disease. Do not move or reuse items that cannot be cleaned and disinfected—such as cardboard egg flats.

As promised, here’s my detailed review of **Khadlaj Magnate Noble**. I received the perfume on December 30, 2024. That day, I tested it a bit, spraying it on and giving it a quick trial. After that, I let it rest for a few weeks to allow the scent to settle and mature.

As I mentioned in my previous post, this is a dupe of **Dior Sauvage Elixir**. The resemblance to the original fragrance is striking—if I had to express it in percentage, I’d say it’s about 90% similar.

Last week, I tested it in various situations. For example, one morning, I sprayed it on before heading to the office and didn’t reapply throughout the day (this was to test its longevity). I also wore it to a formal gathering in a suit (I wanted to see if it would draw any compliments, which would test its projection and sillage). Additionally, I used it on a date night with my wife, spraying it on to see how it performed in her eyes. If she likes it that means it's a good quality perfume.

Let’s start with **longevity**! As I mentioned, I sprayed it on at 5 AM before heading to the office. By the time I arrived at 7 AM, I could still smell it strongly on myself—and even at 8 AM. I can confidently say the fragrance was prominent throughout the morning and still noticeable after lunch. By the afternoon, it wasn’t as bold, but I would still catch whiffs of it from time to time. At that point, it was likely detectable only in close proximity. By 5 PM, I could only smell it on my skin if I brought it very close to my nose. However, it lingered much longer on my clothes.

How much did I spray? Six sprays on my skin (two behind each ear, two on the back of my neck) and four on my clothes (one on each side of my shirt collar and two on the chest area of my shirt).

**Projection and Sillage!**  
At 5 PM, I applied my usual 10 sprays and arrived at the gathering by 5:30. The fragrance was nicely noticeable on me throughout the entire 2.5-hour event. I received several compliments about how good I smelled, and one of my friends even asked for the name of the perfume. For around 2.5 hours, my scent was clearly detectable from arm’s length (and I dare say, possibly even farther).

**Quality!**  
My wife has an excellent nose—she’s actually the one who introduced me to the world of fragrances, so her opinion carries a lot of weight. She really liked this one as well and felt that its quality is on par with any designer perfume. Comparing the two, they’re very similar. Both my wife and I noticed that Magnate Noble seems to have an added coffee aroma, which makes it slightly more aromatic. On the other hand, the lavender in Sauvage Elixir feels of higher quality and gives a slightly more complex impression, whereas Magnate Noble comes across as a bit lighter and more airy. I really like that the atomizer is pressurized.

**Summary!**  
This perfume has won me over. I genuinely love Sauvage Elixir, and I’m thrilled to have found an affordable alternative. If you enjoy the masculine, barbershop vibe of the original, you’ll like this one too. For me, it’s a solid 9/10.",1,1737467459.0,fragranceclones,2,1.0,False
1i6izq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1i6izq7/portafilter_basket_spins_inside_portafilter_when/,Portafilter basket spins inside portafilter when locking in.,"I got my E24 a month ago and it's my first real espresso machine.

Since the beginning I noticed that locking the PF in had a sort of rough and grinding feeling to it.

At first I thought this was the ears of the PF grinding against the group head, and that they would smooth out over time as they wore into each other.

Yesterday I realized that I think it's more likely this feeling actually comes from the basket spinning inside the PF. Like under very little pressure the basket doesn't want to turn against the gasket anymore and then it's just PF turning while basket stays stationary.

Is there anything to do about this? Will it go away over time? It sort of makes me wonder if the grinding will produce any metal dust, but mostly it's just not a nice tactile feeling.

I could try oiling the gasket but that's not something you can really undo and might be a bad idea. Maybe coffee oils normally lubricate them over time?",1,1737467428.0,gaggiaclassic,0,1.0,False

1i6ixn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Target/comments/1i6ixn4/my_horrible_experience_working_at_target/,My horrible experience working at Target,"I previously worked at Target, specifically in the Starbucks Department. I’ve worked for over a dozen companies throughout my life with a variety of different job responsibilities and I have never had a work experience as horrible as my experience working at Target

I want to start by saying that I think Target is a probably a fine company and I’ve personally shopped there my entire life. I also worked at 2 different Target locations and I very much enjoyed working at the first one. I have no hate for Target as a whole, I think I just unfortunately had to work at a bad apple

The people there were horrible to work with and be around. They were very mean, inconsiderate, self absorbed, entitled people who only cared about themselves. Next to them I seemed like the hardest worker ever but that’s not the case, I only seemed that way because I was standing next to them. Most people work just as hard as I do that I’ve worked with since then

Most people I work with are nothing like that. I’ve never worked with people like that. I had a co worker who laughed at another’s self harm scars, I had a coworker who got to high on his vape in the back room so he had to leave early because he was “feeling sick”, almost every shift I would be taking orders/making drinks with a line while my co workers are all in the back talking

But most of all, they were just mean mean horrible people. They were bullies. They lacked any sort of empathy for others. I’m the kind of person who has a lot of empathy and I feel I care more than others, honestly to a fault, but these people only cared about themselves, they were mean people that were a nightmare to be around and I don’t feel that way about any one else I’ve ever worked with

The places I’ve worked in the past and the few places I’ve worked at since then have all been good. I’ve liked my co workers and they’ve all really liked me. I mean most of my co workers really really like me it seems and that made me happy in the past and somewhat helps now. There are good people, most people are good, people at Scooters, local coffee shops I’ve worked at, my other coffee shop, Quiktrip, Best Buy, premium retail, grove, they were all good people that I had no issues with at all and they even really missed me when I left but this place was filled with the most horrible people I’ve ever met at Target.

I had one specific coworker who kept harassing me and bullying me. I thought this person was a friend, a friendship I valued, but then we had one conversation they didn’t like where I asked them to stop doing something and they completed turned on me

They decided in that moment they were going to do everything in their power to be as horrible towards me as possible and to make me miserable to make everyone there hate me. And they did. Before this I didn’t have any issues with anyone that worked there. Everyone there really liked me which was how it normally was. This one coworker made that place a nightmare for me and did everything they could to make everyone there hate me and to make me sad and feel bad about myself

I considered this person a friend, someone I was always nice to and joking around with, someone I would’ve never treated the same, and they bullied me and harassed me and yelled at me and made mean comments towards me and spread lies about me for 6+ months and it destroyed me and my mental health

I tried asking for help from my co workers, I tried making complaints with hr and calling corporate but nothing helped. I made the complaint because I just wanted to be left alone, I couldn’t take any more, but after they continued making comments and bullying me. There was nothing I could do so I had to quit even though I could barely pay my bills and really needed that job

A big part of the blame is management. Hr and my etl did nothing to help. They treated everything like it was a joke and were too laid back to a fault. My Starbucks manager was the same way. She could’ve helped me but never even once tried. And I thought she was a friend to but I was wrong to think that. I was the hardest worker there and my manager pretended to be my friend so I would keep working hard. She used me to make her life easier but when I was being bullied and needed her help she did nothing to help me. She was too busy smoking weed and getting high at work to help me out even though the bullying was destroying my mental health she did nothing to help me or hr or the etl.

Luckily since leaving there I’ve worked at a few different locations with all great people who have been kind, mature, hardworking, considerate and overall good people. I worked at Target for so long that I let those people convince me that there was something wrong with me, that I was the issue, and I let them drag me down. I know now that im a good people, most people I meet now or have met in the past really really like me and they’re always commenting on how helpful I am or how im their “bestie” or how it’s a pleasure working with me. It helps to be surrounded by good people because for a while I was surrounded by the meanest most inconsiderate people I’ve ever met and I let them convince me that there is something wrong with me but I know better now.

I just wanted to share my experience working here. It truly was the worst experience of my life having to be around those people which is why it still bothers me even now and why im making this post. I truly care about kindness and helping people more than anything and that shows from me everyday. Which is why the way the people here treated me and others bothers me the way it does. They were horrible people and it’s wrong to treat others that way. Bullying someone for 6+months with the intention of trying to make someone as sad and miserable as you can, not caring at all about how it affects that person or their well being and worst of all to act that way towards someone who was nothing but nice to you and just came to work and constantly joked around with you and tried to be your friend, someone who thought they were your friend. I don’t want to be friends or anywhere near someone horrible like that. I want nothing to do with people who treat others that way

That place and all the people there made me miserable and management did nothing to help. They ignored an employee getting bullied for 6 months and even encouraged the people there to act the way they did. I hope other people on here had better experiences working at Target. I hope these people I worked with understand what they did was wrong and how much it affected me and really really hurt me then and still hurts me now

I don’t even remember the drive home. My hands were locked on the wheel, knuckles white, sweat dripping down my forehead. My stomach churned, but I didn’t stop, didn’t pull over—I just needed to get away. Away from the gas station, from that parking lot, from him.

The name echoed in my head like a goddamn curse. He said it so casually, like it was supposed to mean something. Like it was supposed to stick. And it did.

The smell of burnt flesh lingered in my nostrils, thick and acrid, no matter how many times I rolled the windows down. Every time I blinked, I saw that man’s face—twisted in shock and pain, the glowing red beams punching through his chest and leaving nothing but smoke and silence.

By the time I got back to my apartment, my legs were shaking so badly I could barely climb the stairs. I fumbled with my keys, dropped them twice, and finally shoved the door open. The second I stepped inside, I locked the door, bolted it, and pushed a chair under the handle for good measure.

I collapsed onto the couch, my heart pounding in my chest. My hands were still trembling, my palms slick with sweat. My brain kept screaming, This isn’t real. This can’t be real.

But it was real.

I grabbed my phone, desperate for… something. Answers, maybe? I don’t know what I thought I’d find, but I started searching. “Man with glowing eyes.” “Laser vision kills.” “Sonic boom sound.” Every search brought up nothing but comic book characters and fake conspiracy theories.

The world didn’t even know he existed.

I didn’t sleep. Not really. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw his face, that goddamn smirk, those eyes that burned like molten steel.

In one dream—or maybe it was real—I was back at the gas station. The parking lot was empty, silent, except for the hum of the neon sign. I turned, and there he was, standing just a few feet away, his hands shoved into his hoodie pockets.

“Still scared?” he asked, his voice calm, almost playful.

I couldn’t move, couldn’t speak.

“You should be,” he said, his grin widening. “This is only the beginning.”

I woke up drenched in sweat, gasping for air. The room was silent, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone. I sat there for hours, staring at the door, waiting for the knock I knew was coming.

The next day, I tried to go to work. I thought maybe if I could get back to some kind of routine, I could forget about him. But nothing felt right.

The fluorescent lights in the gas station were too bright, the hum of the coolers too loud. Every time a customer walked in, I flinched, expecting to see him standing there, grinning at me from behind the counter.

By the time my shift ended, my nerves were shot. I drove home in silence, every shadow on the road making my heart jump.

When I got back to my apartment, I found the door unlocked.

I stopped cold, my breath hitching in my throat. I knew I’d locked it—I knew I had.

Slowly, I pushed the door open, my hands trembling. The apartment was quiet, but something felt wrong. The air was heavy, the kind of pressure that makes your ears pop.

“Hello?” I called out, my voice barely above a whisper.

No response.

I stepped inside, every nerve in my body screaming at me to turn around and leave. But I couldn’t. I had to know.

The living room was empty. So was the kitchen. I checked the bathroom, the bedroom, every closet. Nothing.

But when I came back to the living room, I saw it.

Scrawled across the wall in black marker, messy and uneven, were two words:

“Still watching.”

I didn’t sleep that night. How could I? He was in my apartment. He was here. He was playing with me, watching me, waiting for the right moment to show up and ruin my life all over again.

The next morning, I packed a bag. Clothes, cash, a flashlight, anything I could think of. I didn’t have a plan—I just needed to get out.

As I was stuffing the bag into my car, I heard it again. That low, rumbling sound, like a sonic boom in the distance.

My blood ran cold.

I turned, my heart pounding in my chest, and there he was.

He was standing across the parking lot, leaning casually against a lamppost. His eyes weren’t glowing this time, but that smirk was still there, sharp and cruel.

“Going somewhere?” he called out, his voice carrying easily across the lot.

I froze. My hands clenched into fists, my entire body trembling with a mix of fear and rage. “What do you want from me?” I shouted.

He pushed off the lamppost and started walking toward me, his hands in his hoodie pockets. “You know,” he said, tilting his head, “you ask that a lot. It’s almost like you think this is about you.”

“It’s not?” I asked, my voice shaking.

He laughed, shaking his head. “Oh, man. You really don’t get it, do you? This isn’t some grand plan, some master scheme. This is just me… having fun.”

“Why me?” I demanded.

He stopped a few feet away, looking me up and down like I was some kind of joke. “Why not?” he said, grinning.

I don’t know what came over me, but I snapped. “Fuck you,” I spat. “I’m not your toy. I’m not going to keep letting you do this to me.”

His grin widened, and for the first time, his eyes began to glow, faint but unmistakable. “Oh, you’re not? That’s cute.”

Before I could react, he reached out, grabbing the bag from my car. He cocked his arm back and threw it across the lot like it weighed nothing, the contents scattering everywhere.

I stumbled back, my heart pounding.

“You’re not going anywhere,” he said, his voice low and dangerous. “Not until I decide I’m done with you.”

“Bud, if I wanted you dead, you’d be dead by now.”

His voice was calm, almost bored, but it hit me like a punch to the gut. He tilted his head, that smirk never leaving his face. “And I see you tried to tell my story on Reddit a few months ago. Too bad it didn’t get much attention, huh?”

My heart sank. My chest tightened, and it felt like the air had been sucked out of the parking lot. How the hell did he know? My mind was racing, trying to make sense of it. Who was this guy? What was he?

Before I could even open my mouth to ask, he cut me off with a mocking laugh. “I have an iPhone, dumbass.”

I froze, staring at him. That… made no sense. What did that even mean? My confusion must’ve been written all over my face because he leaned in closer, his smirk widening.

“Oh, come on,” he said, rolling his eyes. “What, you think I don’t keep up? You think I’m some, what, ancient cryptid who doesn’t know how to Google his name? Newsflash: I love seeing how people talk about me. Keeps me entertained. And you?” He pointed at me, his tone dripping with mockery. “You, my little chronicler, didn’t exactly light up the internet with your story, did you?”

I stammered, trying to find words, but nothing came out.

He laughed again, shaking his head like I was some kind of joke. “Oh, don’t feel bad. It was a good read. A little melodramatic, but hey, points for effort. I mean, you really tried to make me sound scary.” He stepped closer, his eyes narrowing. “But do you know what’s actually scary?”

I swallowed hard, my throat dry. “What?”

“This,” he said, and in a blur, he was standing inches away from me, his face so close I could see the faint glow of his eyes reflecting off my own. “The fact that I’m standing here right now. That no matter what you write, what you think, or what you do, I’ll always know. And you? You’ll never know what’s coming next.”

I stumbled back, my heart pounding in my chest.

“Don’t bother trying to delete the post,” he added, his smirk returning. “I already screenshotted it. Thought it’d be funny to keep for the memories.”

I couldn’t speak. My mind was spinning, my legs trembling.

“Relax,” he said, stepping back and shrugging. “I’m not gonna kill you. Like I said, if I wanted you dead, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation. But you’ve got potential, bud. You’re entertaining. And I like entertaining things.”

I couldn’t stop myself. “Why? Why me?”

Lavoix let out an exaggerated groan, throwing his head back like I’d just told the lamest joke in history. “Why do you always say ‘why me’? Seriously, bud, you sound like a fucking broken record.” He stared at me, his smirk widening into something sharper, more condescending. “Do you think if you keep asking, I’m just gonna suddenly go, ‘Oh, you’re right! My bad, wrong guy!’ and fuck off? Is that the plan here?”

I opened my mouth to respond, but my brain was too scrambled to come up with anything. Finally, I just mumbled, “I don’t… I don’t know what else to say.”

Lavoix snorted, shaking his head like I was the most pitiful thing he’d ever seen. “You don’t know what else to say? Really? Out of all the words in the English language, that’s what you’re going with? Christ, you’re even more boring than I thought.”

He started pacing lazily, hands in his hoodie pockets, his voice dripping with mockery as he continued. “You could’ve asked me literally anything, y’know. Like, ‘What are you?’ Or, ‘How do I make you leave me alone?’ Hell, even a ‘Please don’t hurt me’ would’ve been more original than why me.”

I felt the heat rising in my face, equal parts fear and humiliation. “I don’t know!” I snapped, my voice cracking. “I just… I don’t know why this is happening. I don’t know what you want from me!”

He stopped pacing and turned to face me, his smirk softening into something… different. Almost pitying. Almost. “Oh, buddy,” he said, shaking his head. “That’s the thing—you don’t get it. I don’t want anything from you. This isn’t some cosmic karmic punishment, or some secret destiny bullshit. You’re just… there. And I’m just… bored.”

He paused, letting the weight of his words sink in before leaning in slightly, his glowing eyes narrowing as he spoke. “You’re not the main character in some grand story. You’re just the poor schmuck who happened to walk into mine.”

My stomach twisted, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might break through my chest. I couldn’t tell if I was angry, terrified, or both.

And just like that, the smirk snapped back onto his face. “But hey,” he said, his voice light and teasing, “if you keep asking ‘why me,’ I might just laser your fucking head off for variety. At least that would be something new, huh?”

I gritted my teeth and forced the words out before I could stop myself. “If you were gonna ‘laser my head off,’ you would’ve done it by now. So what do you achieve by saying this? Do you think you’re scaring me? Because I’m not afraid of you anymore.”

The moment the words left my mouth, I felt the air change. Lavoix’s smirk froze for a split second before it shifted—wider, sharper, like a wolf spotting its prey. He tilted his head, his glowing eyes narrowing as he stepped closer, slow and deliberate.

“You’re not afraid of me anymore?” he repeated, his voice low and mockingly soft. “That’s a big statement, bud. Really big. I mean, I’d clap for you, but…” He raised his hands, fingers twitching slightly. “I might accidentally crush your tiny little ego.”

I stood my ground, even though my legs were shaking so bad it felt like they’d give out any second. “Yeah,” I said, forcing the words past the lump in my throat. “You keep talking about how much power you have, but all you do is threaten me and play these games. If you’re so untouchable, why not just do it?”

His eyes flared brighter, and for a moment, I thought I’d crossed a line I shouldn’t have. But instead of exploding—or, you know, lasering my head off—he laughed. Loud, sharp, and so sudden it made me flinch.

“Holy shit, you’ve got some balls after all!” he said, doubling over as if it was the funniest thing he’d ever heard. “Man, I almost feel bad for what’s coming next. Almost.”

He straightened up, wiping an imaginary tear from his eye, and leaned in close, so close I could feel the heat radiating off him. His voice dropped to a whisper, deadly calm and dripping with menace. “Let me explain something to you, buddy. You’re not not afraid of me. You’re just stupid enough to think this is bravery. And you know what? That’s fine. I like it when people try to act tough. Makes it so much more fun when I break them.”

I didn’t move. I couldn’t. My chest was tight, my heart pounding so loud I thought he’d hear it.

“Not afraid of me,” he muttered, shaking his head with a grin. “That’s cute. Really, it is. But let me give you a little reminder.”

Before I could react, he reached out and grabbed the chair I had been sitting on. With zero effort, he squeezed it in his hand, the wood groaning and splintering until it collapsed into a pile of broken pieces. He let the remains drop to the ground and leaned in even closer.

“You don’t have to be afraid of me,” he said, his voice low and ice-cold. “But you’re gonna wish you were.”

And with that, he stepped back, that smirk plastered across his face again. “Anyway, I’ll see you around, champ. Don’t get too comfortable.”

He was gone in the blink of an eye, leaving me standing there, staring at the pile of broken wood and shaking like a leaf.

I wanted to believe what I’d said. I wanted to believe I wasn’t afraid anymore.

But deep down, I knew I was lying.

The next day, I dragged myself to work, desperate for some kind of normalcy. My shift at the convenience store was mind-numbing as always—ringing up cigarettes, stocking shelves, cleaning up spilled soda from aisle two. It was the kind of monotony I used to hate, but now, I’d take it over the constant feeling of being hunted.

For most of the day, nothing happened. Customers came and went, oblivious to my barely-contained anxiety. I started convincing myself that maybe, just maybe, he was done with me. That what he said yesterday was just more of his twisted games.

Then, with about thirty minutes left in my shift, the door’s bell jingled, and I froze.

It was him.

He strolled in like he owned the place, his hoodie pulled over his head, his hands stuffed casually in his sweatpants pockets. That smirk—the one that made my stomach turn—was plastered across his face.

“Afternoon, champ,” he said, his voice cutting through the silence like a knife.

I swallowed hard, forcing myself to keep my expression neutral. “What do you want?”

“What, no ‘welcome to the store’? No ‘how can I help you today’? Man, your customer service sucks,” he said, chuckling as he wandered down the aisles.

I clenched my fists, my palms slick with sweat, and kept my eyes on him as he lazily browsed the shelves. He picked up a pack of gum, turning it over in his hands like it was the most fascinating thing in the world.

“You know,” he said, not looking at me, “I’ve been thinking about what you said yesterday. About how you’re not afraid of me anymore.”

I didn’t respond. I just watched him, my heart pounding in my chest.

“I gotta say,” he continued, tossing the gum back onto the shelf, “that was ballsy. Stupid as hell, but ballsy. So, I figured I’d stop by and see how that new ‘fearless you’ is holding up.”

He turned to me, his glowing eyes faint but unmistakable. “Spoiler alert: you don’t look fearless.”

“What do you want from me?” I said through gritted teeth.

He grinned, walking up to the counter and leaning on it like we were old friends. “I told you already: nothing. You’re the one who keeps asking that dumbass question. I’m just here for the vibes, man. To hang out. Keep you on your toes. Y’know, make sure you don’t get too comfortable.”

I stared at him, my hands shaking as I gripped the edge of the counter. “You can’t keep doing this.”

“Can’t I?” he said, raising an eyebrow. “Who’s gonna stop me? You?” He laughed, loud and sharp. “Yeah, sure, buddy. Go ahead. Stop me. Right here, right now. I dare you.”

I didn’t move.

“That’s what I thought,” he said, his grin widening. He straightened up and gestured around the store. “Relax. I’m not here to burn the place down or melt your face off. I’m just… curious. Wanted to see where you work, what you do. And now that I have, I gotta say…” He glanced around at the dingy shelves and flickering fluorescent lights. “Wow. This is depressing as hell.”

I clenched my fists tighter. “If you’re just here to insult me, you can leave.”

“Oh, but then I’d miss all the fun,” he said, leaning forward again. His voice dropped, low and taunting. “Here’s the thing, bud. You don’t get to tell me what to do. This is my world. You’re just living in it.”

I opened my mouth to respond, but before I could say anything, a customer walked in—a middle-aged man in a business suit.

“Afternoon,” the man said, glancing between me and Lavoix before heading toward the coffee station.

Lavoix didn’t take his eyes off me. “Tell you what,” he said, his voice soft but menacing. “I’ll let you finish your shift. I’m feeling generous today. But don’t get too comfy, champ. I’ll be back.”

And just like that, he was gone. One second he was standing there, and the next, the door jingled as it swung shut behind him, though I never saw him leave.

The customer came up to the counter, a cup of coffee in hand, and gave me a weird look. “You alright?” he asked.

I nodded stiffly, forcing a weak smile as I rang him up.

But I wasn’t alright. Not even close. Because I knew he meant it.

Many of you might not believe what I’m about to say next. Hell, if I were reading this, I probably wouldn’t either. But I swear on my life, on everything I’ve ever known, that this happened. It sounds impossible—like something ripped out of a comic book or a bad movie—but it’s real. And it’s terrifying.

When I was walking to my car after my shift ended, I saw him again. Lavoix. He was leaning against my car like he’d been waiting for me, his arms crossed and that ever-present smirk on his face.

“Long day?” he asked casually, as if we were friends meeting up after work.

I stopped dead in my tracks, my heart racing. “What do you want now?”

He pushed himself off the car and started pacing in front of me, his hands in his hoodie pockets. “You’re always so tense. Relax, bud. I’m not here to mess with you—well, not just to mess with you. I figured it’s time we had a little chat. A heart-to-heart, y’know?”

I didn’t respond, just stared at him as he continued.

“You’ve probably figured out some of my tricks by now,” he said, his eyes faintly glowing as he gestured toward himself. “But let me lay it out for you, just so we’re clear. I’m not like you. I’m stronger, faster, tougher. I can fly, I can shoot lasers out of my eyes—you’ve seen that firsthand—and if I wanted to, I could break every bone in your body before you even blink.”

My throat went dry, but I forced myself to stay calm.

“And here’s the fun part,” he continued, leaning in slightly. “Time isn’t exactly… linear for me. If I want to, I can go back, forward, sideways—whatever. Your little ‘clock’ doesn’t mean shit to me.”

“You can… time travel?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

“Bingo,” he said, grinning. “But it’s not as simple as hopping into a DeLorean. You’ve gotta hit a certain speed—fast enough to break the rules, y’know? And lucky me, I’m just fast enough to make it work.”

My head was spinning. This couldn’t be real. It just couldn’t.

“So, here’s the deal,” he said, stepping closer. “You’ve got questions, right? About why I do what I do, why I picked you, all that ‘why me’ crap you love so much. Well, let’s go find some answers. Let’s take a little trip.”

“A trip?” I asked, frowning. “To where?”

“To when,” he corrected, his smirk widening. “January 21st. A couple months back. You remember that day, don’t you?”

I froze, my mind racing. January 21st. That was the day I first saw him. The day everything started.

“Why?” I asked.

“Let’s just say I have a feeling you’re gonna find it… enlightening,” he said, his tone dripping with amusement. “Now, you can come willingly, or I can drag you along kicking and screaming. Your call.”

I wanted to tell him to go to hell, but something in his voice, in the way he said it, made me hesitate. Against my better judgment, I nodded.

“Alright,” he said, clapping his hands together. “Buckle up, champ. This is gonna be a wild ride.”

“Buckle up, champ. This is gonna be a wild ride,” Lavoix said with a grin. Before I could ask what the hell that meant, he grabbed me—literally scooped me up in his arms like I weighed nothing—and the world vanished.

It wasn’t just fast. It was incomprehensible.

One second, I was standing on solid ground, the cold night air on my face, and the next, everything around me dissolved into a blur. It wasn’t like running or even falling—it was something entirely beyond explanation. I couldn’t move, couldn’t scream, couldn’t even think. The sheer speed of it was overwhelming, like my body had been ripped out of reality itself and hurled into some impossible void.

And that’s when I saw it.

The tunnel.

At least, that’s what my brain wants to call it, but nothing about it made sense. It wasn’t a tunnel in the way you think of one—it wasn’t cylindrical, it wasn’t confined. It was infinite. A kaleidoscope of colors, shapes, and patterns stretched out in every direction, folding and twisting in ways that shouldn’t be possible.

The colors… I don’t even have words for them. They weren’t colors you’d see in a sunset or a rainbow. They weren’t colors you could paint or recreate on a screen. These were hues that didn’t belong in this universe, shades that made my eyes water and my brain ache just trying to process them. They shifted constantly, blending into each other, forming new colors that I didn’t even know could exist.

And the shapes. Jesus Christ, the shapes. They defied logic. They defied reality. Some of them looked solid, others looked fluid, and some were both at the same time. They’d stretch and compress, fold into themselves, and then unfold in ways that made my stomach churn. It was like looking at geometry through the lens of madness.

For a moment, I thought, This is it. I’ve lost my mind. This is what it feels like to go insane.

The only thing I could compare it to was an acid trip—but no, that doesn’t even come close. I’ve dabbled with psychedelics before. I’ve seen the swirling colors, the melting edges of the world. But this? This wasn’t like LSD, or shrooms, or DMT, or any drug you could find in this life. No substance on Earth could make you feel what I felt in that tunnel. It was like I was staring at the raw fabric of existence—seeing reality stripped bare, its guts on full display, and it was too much. My brain wasn’t built for it.

I couldn’t breathe. The air wasn’t air anymore; it was something denser, thicker, like the pressure of being miles underwater. My chest felt like it might implode. My eyes watered, not just from the wind whipping past us but from the sheer wrongness of what I was seeing.

“Hang tight!” Lavoix yelled, his voice cutting through the madness, smug and carefree like this was nothing to him. His grip on me tightened as he sped up—sped up—and somehow, impossibly, it got faster.

The shapes started folding inward, spiraling toward a single point ahead of us. It was like we were rushing toward the center of the universe, the very heart of time itself. I wanted to close my eyes, to shut it out, but I couldn’t. I was transfixed, terrified, and helpless.

And then, just as quickly as it had started, it stopped.

The colors vanished. The shapes were gone. And we were standing in the parking lot of my apartment complex.

The cold air hit me like a slap to the face, and I stumbled, barely catching myself before falling to the ground. My legs felt like jelly, my chest heaving as I tried to suck in breaths.

I looked around, my heart still racing, and that’s when I realized it wasn’t March 15th anymore.

It was January 21st, 2025. Though, I had no idea yet.

“Where the fuck were we?!” I gasped, doubling over as my knees threatened to give out. My voice was hoarse, my chest heaving like I’d just run a marathon I didn’t sign up for.

Lavoix, of course, looked completely unfazed, standing there with his hands casually stuffed in his hoodie pockets, his smirk plastered across his face like he’d just finished a Sunday stroll.

“You liked that?” he asked, tilting his head, his voice smug. “Pretty trippy, huh?”

“Trippy?!” I snapped, my voice cracking. “What the fuck was that? Where the fuck were we?! That wasn’t normal! That wasn’t fucking… anything!”

He laughed, shaking his head. “Man, you humans are so dramatic. Alright, fine, I’ll explain it, but you might want to sit down. Not that it’ll help your little pea brain wrap around it.”

I glared at him, but I didn’t argue. My legs were trembling so badly I half-considered actually sitting down.

“Okay, so here’s the deal,” he said, gesturing with his hands like a teacher explaining quantum physics to a kindergartner. “That place we just went through? That’s… let’s call it the time tunnel. Sounds cool, right? Basically, it’s what you get when you break the speed of light and start fucking with time itself.”

I stared at him, my mind struggling to catch up. “The… time tunnel?”

“Yeah,” he said, rolling his eyes. “It’s not a real tunnel, genius. It’s more like a… layer of reality. When you move fast enough—like, really fast—you stop playing by the normal rules. You punch through space and time, and what you saw back there? That’s the in-between. The guts of reality. The place where all the boring shit—like physics—stops working the way you think it should.”

I felt my stomach churn at the memory of those colors, those impossible shapes. “That… that was the in-between?”

“Bingo,” he said, snapping his fingers. “Most people can’t handle seeing it, but lucky for you, I kept you in one piece. You’re welcome, by the way.”

I wanted to throw up. “It felt like I was gonna… I don’t know, fall apart. Like my brain couldn’t even handle looking at it.”

“Yeah, that tracks,” Lavoix said with a shrug. “It’s not meant for you. You’re like a cheap phone trying to run next-gen graphics—you overheat just trying to process it. But me? I’m built for it. I can zip through that place all day and not even break a sweat.”

I stared at him, the weight of his words sinking in. “So… you can just do that? Anytime you want?”

“Pretty much,” he said, grinning. “But it’s not like I take a scenic tour every day. It’s a tool, y’know? A way to get from now to then without having to sit in traffic or deal with your stupid human concept of time.”

“This is insane,” I muttered, shaking my head. “This is completely fucking insane.”

“Welcome to my world,” Lavoix said, spreading his arms dramatically. “Or, y’know, the timeline I let you live in. You should feel special. Most people don’t get to see that place and live to talk about it.”

I didn’t feel special. I felt small. Insignificant. Like I was standing next to something so far beyond me that it could crush me without a second thought.

And the worst part? He knew it.

“But why January 21st?” I demanded, my voice shaking with frustration. “What’s so special about this day? Why’d you bring me back here?”

Lavoix’s smirk widened, his glowing eyes narrowing just slightly. “Well,” he said, drawing out the word like he was savoring it, “you haven’t made a part two to your story yet. And so many people asked you to do so—figured I’d give you a little creative inspiration.”

I blinked, my confusion quickly boiling into anger. “So this is all about you?”

He raised an eyebrow, amused. “Of course it’s about me. Who else would it be about? You?”

“That’s… pathetic,” I snapped, cutting him off. “You just want attention? That’s what this is? You’re screwing with my life, dragging me through some psychedelic nightmare, just so you can get your ego stroked? Jesus Christ, you’re worse than I thought.”

For a moment, his smirk froze, and the air seemed to thicken. His eyes flared briefly, the glow intensifying, and I felt a shiver crawl down my spine. Then, to my surprise, he laughed.

“Pathetic?” he repeated, his voice sharp with mockery. “I’m pathetic? You’re standing here, in the middle of time itself, because I brought you here. You wouldn’t even know what pathetic is without me, bud.”

He leaned in, his face inches from mine, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. “You’re not wrong, though. I do like the attention. But don’t get it twisted. This isn’t about needing anything from you. This is about me choosing to make you squirm because it’s fun. And right now? You’re doing a great job of entertaining me.”

I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms as I glared at him. “So what happens now? You just keep playing your little games until you get bored?”

“Bingo,” he said, grinning like a kid who’d just won a prize. “But hey, look on the bright side—at least your story has a part two now.”

I didn’t respond. I couldn’t. The sheer arrogance, the cruelty of it, was suffocating. And yet, deep down, I knew he wasn’t lying. This was his game, and I was just a piece on the board.

“Anyway,” he said, stepping back and cracking his neck, “we’ve got some time to kill. Let’s see if you can make it interesting.”

I don’t know what came over me after that. Maybe it was exhaustion, or maybe I’d finally reached the point where fear just didn’t have room to live in my head anymore. But instead of arguing, instead of yelling or throwing more insults, I just sighed.

“Fine,” I muttered.

Lavoix blinked, his smirk faltering for the first time. “Fine?”

“Yeah, fine,” I said, rubbing my temples. “You win. I get it. You’re stronger than me, smarter than me, faster than me, whatever. You’ve made your point. So, what now? Are we just going to keep bouncing around time while you stroke your ego, or is there an actual plan here?”

For a second, he just stared at me, clearly caught off guard. Then, to my surprise, he laughed—a real, genuine laugh, not the mocking kind I was used to.

“Holy shit,” he said, shaking his head. “I didn’t think you had it in you. Looks like the little human’s finally growing a backbone.”

“Yeah, well,” I said, crossing my arms, “if you’re going to keep dragging me into your bullshit, I might as well make the best of it.”

“Make the best of it?” he repeated, his grin returning. “I like that. Alright, bud, let’s call it a truce. For now.”

“Truce?” I raised an eyebrow. “What does that even mean with someone like you?”

“It means,” he said, shrugging, “I’ll stop messing with your head as much. And in return, you stop whining about ‘why me’ every five minutes. Deal?”

I hesitated, trying to read his expression. As much as I hated him, I couldn’t deny that he wasn’t exactly what I’d expected. He wasn’t just some mindless monster. There was… something else.

“Deal,” I said finally.

He clapped his hands together. “Now we’re talking! Who knows, this might even be fun.”

I rolled my eyes, but I couldn’t help the small smile tugging at the corner of my mouth. “Yeah, fun. Sure.”

For the next few hours—or maybe it was minutes, or days, because time didn’t seem to mean anything around him—we talked. Not about anything serious, at least not at first. He’d crack jokes about how slow humans were, or how boring my job was, and I’d throw back half-hearted jabs about his need for attention.

It was… strange. Almost normal.

At one point, as we sat on the curb outside my apartment, he looked up at the sky and said, “You know, it’s not all bad being me. Sure, I could crush everything around me if I wanted to, but… sometimes it’s nice to just sit and watch.”

“That’s the first non-asshole thing I’ve ever heard you say,” I said, half-laughing.

“Don’t get used to it,” he shot back, smirking.

It wasn’t friendship—not exactly. But for the first time since I’d met him, I didn’t feel like he was going to destroy me at any moment. And that was… something.

“So, what happens now?” I asked, looking over at him.

He leaned back, his hands behind his head, and grinned. “Now? Now we figure out how to make this timeline interesting.”

“No,” I said firmly, standing up and brushing off the curb dirt. “You brought me here for a reason. You want me to tell people about you. Admit it—this is your chance to become known in the world, to stop hiding in the shadows like some… cosmic prankster.”

Lavoix snorted, rolling his eyes so hard it looked like they might get stuck. “If I wanted to be known, I would’ve been already,” he said, his tone dripping with condescension. “Trust me, bud, it’s not exactly hard to get attention when you can blow up a building by blinking.”

“Then why all this?” I snapped, gesturing wildly. “Why bring me here? Why mess with me in the first place? If you’re not trying to make a name for yourself, then what the hell are you doing?”

He stood up lazily, brushing imaginary dust off his hoodie. “What am I doing? I’m living, man. That’s the whole point. You think I need the world to know my name to feel validated? That’s such a you problem.”

I clenched my fists, frustrated at his nonchalance. “Then why me? Why any of this?”

Lavoix leaned in closer, that smirk back in full force. “Because I like you, bud. You’ve got… potential. You’re boring, sure, but you’ve got that spark. The way you fight back, even when you know you’re outclassed? That’s entertaining as hell. You think I’d waste this much effort on someone I didn’t find interesting?”

I took a step back, trying to process his words. “So, what? You’re just keeping me around for laughs?”

“Pretty much,” he said with a shrug. “And because, whether you admit it or not, you’re learning. Every time you push back, every time you try to figure me out, you’re getting stronger. Smarter. Maybe even a little… like me.”

The thought sent a shiver down my spine. “I’m nothing like you.”

“Not yet,” he said, his grin widening. “But who knows? Maybe you’ll surprise me.”

I shook my head, sitting back down on the curb. “You’re insane, you know that?”

“Yeah,” he said, sitting beside me again. “But at least I’m honest about it.”

“I’d rather you be honest than sugarcoat it,” I said, exhaling sharply.

Lavoix grinned wider, leaning back like he was basking in my reluctant acceptance. “See? You get me! This is why you’re still around. There’s potential in you, even if you don’t see it yet.” He stretched his arms above his head like this whole situation was nothing more than a casual hangout.

“Anyways,” he continued, standing up with that same effortless swagger, “I’ll leave you be for now. Go write that second part. Post it, get your clicks or whatever, then come talk to me. We’ve got more fun ahead.”

And just like that, he was gone. No dramatic exit, no flash of light. One second he was standing there, and the next, he wasn’t.

I sat there on the curb, staring at the spot where he’d been, my head spinning. How do you even process something like this? The fact that I’m writing it all down right now feels… absurd. But I need to, because if I don’t, I think I’ll go insane.

It’s January 21, 2025. I don’t know how to explain it, but somehow, Lavoix brought me back here—back to this date, months before my reality. He told me to write this, to post it, and I know how ridiculous that sounds. I know no one will believe me.

But it’s the truth.

I don’t know why he’s keeping me here in the past, or if he even plans on bringing me back to where I came from. Hell, maybe he doesn’t even know. To him, it’s probably just another game, another way to screw with me.

The thing is, it doesn’t feel like a game to me. If I’m stuck here, if I’m forced to live these next few months over again, it’s going to feel… wasted. Like I’m running in circles, watching my life play out with the knowledge that none of it is really mine anymore.

But here’s the kicker: I don’t think he cares. To Lavoix, I’m just a passing amusement, a distraction. And maybe that’s all I’ll ever be.

So, here it is. Part two, like he wanted. Believe me or don’t—I don’t care anymore. Him and I are still in our past, and I don’t know if I’ll ever get back to my present.

If Lavoix lets me, maybe I’ll write more. But for now, all I can do is wait. And wonder. And hope that, somehow, I’ll find a way to escape this nightmare.

I’ve been married for seven years and only found out I was autistic two years ago. We have a kid together and I stay home full time but it’s just really hard for me to be a parent and a loving wife. My husband works full time and pays for everything and all he asks is that I cook and keep the house clean and be more affectionate and I struggle with each task. I feel like a burden to him and our kid because I know they deserve better. I also know it’s exhausting dealing with my mood swings and insecurities and I’ve been to therapy for it but I just don’t think I should be in a relationship. I flip out over everything and being with someone who doesn’t understand why I get upset makes me feel like I’m going crazy. Recently we had a friend of my husband and his new wife come for a visit and I spent 3 days deep cleaning the house which meant I was in a bad mood because I’m overwhelmed with the constant list of things I need to take care of before they get here while also worrying about grocery shopping which was the same week and school work because I’m taking online courses. 


His friend’s wife was gorgeous and so polite and respectful but I felt like my husband was being overly friendly because he was making her coffee every morning and he asked if it was okay for her to use my special mug when we had plenty of other mugs available and her own husband would make his own coffee. It’s stupid and I know it’s stupid but I can tell the difference in how he treated her but anytime I bring up how much nicer he is to certain women he says it’s not that deep and I’m making a big deal about nothing. 


This isn’t the first time he’s been more friendly with pretty women like when he was on a work trip he was carrying some other woman’s purse when he doesn’t offer to carry my bags at home. He told me everyone was taking turns carrying it which was true but it still didn’t sit right with me. He’s also been in such a good mood since they left like almost giddy and here I am crying and trying hard not to ruin his mood but he can tell something is wrong with me. It’s just exhausting being like this and I don’t know what a healthy relationship looks like because everyone in my family has either been abused, cheated on, or divorced. I know I’m better off than the women in my family but it still doesn’t feel as good as I expected. ",4,1737466710.0,AutismInWomen,6,1.0,False

Today was different tho as I went with my father and siblings to get some chips before heading to school I saw him buying something he bought it and left quickly I thought he just left quickly as he didn't like me or as usual just not wanting to say anything but when I told my best friend that he asked him jokingly how was the coffee he remembered seeing me and apologised for not saying anything saying he didn't want my dad to think I was friend with a  delinquent like him self.

1i6iofi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1i6iofi/my_new_year_financial_resolution_is_tracking/,My New Year Financial Resolution is Tracking Every Dollar,"This year I have decided enough was enough, 2025 is the year I take full control of my finances. My New Year’s resolution is to track every single dollar I earn and spend, no exceptions. I have set clear goals, save $10,000 by the end of the year, pay off $5,000 in credit card debt, and stick to a monthly budget of $2,500 for all expenses.

To give you some context, I earn $4,500 a month after taxes. My fixed expenses (rent, utilities, insurance) come to $1,800, and I aim to limit my discretionary spending (groceries, eating out, entertainment) to $700. That leaves me with $2,000 a month to save, invest, or use for debt repayment.

Today is January 21st, and for the first time in years, I can proudly say I’ve tracked every single expense so far this month. From the $3 coffee at the corner café to the $150 I spent on groceries last week, every penny is accounted for.

The most eye-opening moment came when I reviewed my spending in the first week. I realized I’d been spending $120 a month on random subscriptions I barely use. Cancelling those felt like an instant win, and I redirected that money straight into my savings account.

I’ve been using a budgeting app that’s made the process ridiculously easy. (Not sure if I can mention names here, but if anyone’s curious, I’m happy to share!) It sends me alerts when I’m nearing my limits and breaks down my spending into categories, which has been a game-changer for spotting wasteful habits.

So far, I’ve saved $1,200 this month—$500 toward my credit card and $700 into my emergency fund. It feels amazing to see progress so quickly, and I’m finally feeling hopeful about reaching my $10,000 goal by December.

How’s everyone else doing with their New Year resolutions?

**Game:** Go Fish

**Venue:** Coffee House  
**Player Limit:** 5

**Rules:**

• This game will be a standard game of Go Fish, but with a catch, the game will be using tarot cards, instead of the regular deck.

• Players will be dealt 5 cards each, all of the Minor Arcana, the rest of the cards including all 22 Major Arcana cards will be in the draw pool.

• The starting player will ask the player on their right if they have any cards of said value, if the other player does have a card/cards of that value, then the other player must hand them over to the player.

• If the other player does not have the card that is asked, then the player who asked must draw from the draw pool, if they pull out a card from the Minor Arcana, there will be no benefits, but drawing a card from the Major Arcana will add the value of that card into their total set values (Example: If your set value is a total of 11, receiving ""The Moon"" Card will add 18 to your total set value)

• The game will continue as on until all 78 cards are off the table, the players must all then count on how many sets they have gotten, and must add the number of the card of the set. For example, if you have a set of 9s, then the set's value is 9. The value of Pages will be 11, Knights are 12, Queens are 13, and Kings are 14.

• The player with the highest value of sets will win the game.

If anyone's interested in trying it out or has suggestions, I'd love to hear from you. Just trying to make entrepreneurship a little less lonely, one coffee at a time.

My job is located in West Roxbury, and I will have to commute via car every day. I also want to live in a place that also connects to the T so I can have at least somewhat of a walkable lifestyle going downtown outside of having to drive to work. I am a 27 year old gay male, and from my research I have found that Jamaica plain has a lot of what I’m looking for- walkable, connects to the T, 15-20 minute drive to work, significant queer population, cool shops/restaurants, etc. I am just wondering how a commute via car from JP to West Roxbury is traffic wise. Google maps shows that I will need to take the VFW Parkway, will this be terrible and congested? The bus doesn’t seem to get where I need to go in a reasonable time so I don’t see another option. I’m also wondering how close to my relocation date should I start looking for housing. I still have about 3 months before I get there so I’m wondering if now is too early. And are there any places within JP that may be best suited for me? Looking at a budget for around 1500$ give or take for a room with roommates. 

I’m also wondering if there are any notable third spaces in the area that I should check out or where I can find community with other gays or people my age (or just in general), and how I can go about making new friends. This can be literally anywhere in the city, I love exploring and getting around. My interests are running, gym, music, walking with coffee, exploring, history, world events and politics, art, etc. I’m not a big partier or drinker  but I do like to go out and have fun. And yes I know about no happy hour and places closing early. 

Really appreciate any advice or insight, the city is still very new to me. Thanks :) ",1,1737465725.0,bostonhousing,0,1.0,False

I'm in a bit of a dilemma with my mother-in-law. I don't know whether or not I should just back off or I should stand my ground in my in my situation, so I'll just jump right in! 

So a little backstory on my relationship with my mother-in-law, we are not close at all I've only met her one time before this incident. Ever since I've known my husband she has never been around, no birthdays, no family get togethers, no calls or texts. All I've been really known about her is that she's a drug user who's been using drugs since before her kids were even born and didn't stop when she was pregnant. Luckily all of her children are healthy and flourishing adults. The one time I did meet her was when me and my husband were going into the grocery store and she was begging for money outside. A small meeting yes but I already had the opinion that I really didn't like her. She's stolen from her children and all the other family members. She pulled my husband's younger sister out of high school to live in a trailer and do drugs. If she ever does call it's because she's in jail it wants to tell her kids how much she loves them but as soon as she gets out she never texts calls or even wants to visit. 

So I'm not very fond of her, because I know how much pain that brings my husband, especially after my father-in-law's passing it made him even more sad that he couldn't have his mom in his life. The last time she texted about a month ago she said she was getting clean and that she would love to see my husband, myself, and our children. (We don't have kids, she so uninvolved that she don't know that) Now on to the situation at hand. 

I support my husband 100% in meeting his mom and spending time with her, but I have only three rules, we do not give her money at all, she's not allowed to know where we live, and when we do have children she will not be allowed to be unsupervised with them. Which to me I feel like that is fair due to her previous drug use and habits of stealing from other people, I don't trust her in that way. Now I completely support her getting clean and I would love for her to be able to have a relationship with our family. 

Now on to the situation at hand, she texted on my husband's birthday a very lovely message about the day my husband was born, it was really sweet and sentimental even though the last paragraph of the message was her talking about how she thinks she's god and has white magic, we just chose to ignore that last part. She asked if we could maybe meet up sometime and catch up I was open to the idea, but was not expecting much. We decided we would meet up that next Saturday. The day comes and we meet up at a local coffee shop in our area, as soon as we get there she wants to give me a big hug and my husband I give her a side kind of awkward hug and order my coffee and sit down she starts going on about how she's found God and she's getting clean and that ""the white magic"" that she has has given her strength. Basically the whole time just talking about herself never asked me or my husband any questions or trying to learn about our lives. She goes on for about 45 minutes until we get to the end of her speech. 

She straight up no joke asks if she could come stay with us since she was kicked out of our local women shelter for breaking their rules. We kind of look at each other very awkwardly and I can see in my husband's eyes that he doesn't want her to come stay with us not only because of my rules but just because they're not that close yet. My husband is very shy and doesn't like confronting people me being the person I am with a sturdy strong golden backbone, I tell her nicely that I don't think that's going to be possible right now. She looks at me gives me a dead-eyed stare and says well I better be going then since I have to find a new place to sleep tonight, and she leaves without even a hug. 

Now after that incident I just was so done with her, I don't care if my husband wants to continue to talk to her or whatever but I made it clear that I don't want to have a relationship with her. My husband understood. A couple days later she text my husband saying that I am unworthy of being with her son and that my husband should divorce me, and find himself a more proper and kind wife. 

So I guess my question is should I just back off to keep the peace or should I stand my ground? ",25,1737465435.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,7,0.96,False

Originally I was okay with this because I don’t mind helping. It’s honestly come to the point where I’m asked to make her coffee, I’m asked to pass her something that’s right next to her. I’m asked to do things that she is fully capable of doing, she doesn’t get off the couch if she doesn’t have to, that’s leads her to asking me to do everything for her, I often feel like a maid and it is getting frustrating, I’m finding it hard to leave the peacefulness of my room because as soon  as I get down there I know she will ask for something, Now when she asks for a favour I say “depends on what it is” The downstairs living room is also where she sleeps so while I am allowed free rein of the house she gets upset if I wake her up making myself food, She doesn’t clean. I often pick up the slack because I can’t stand anything dirty. She says she’ll clean the downstairs cause I’ve talked to her about it once, she said she’ll clean it up and that I’ll be able to relax while I’m down there. Not once has she made the move to clean/tidy any of it up, it’s been a few months. She sleeps and sleeps because she doesn’t sleep at night. She has multiple cats and it’s made downstairs smell so bad, it’s amazed me how she can’t smell it. Occasionally she will clean but boy sitting downstairs watching a show or movie I can’t help but feel gross, if I do bring up issues she often gets defensive, if I don’t do the favours for her she often gets passive aggressive and sometimes will ignore me. My friends also don’t want to come over because it’s gross downstairs and they can’t stand the smell! I’m genuinely asking, how the heck would you address these issues if you were me? I feel I shouldn’t have to tell a grown woman to keep the common areas clean but I guess I’m wrong, Also how do I not sound like a massive hypocrite because I did tell her I was originally okay with her sleeping down there?

1i6i7wu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifts/comments/1i6i7wu/gift_for_me/,Gift for me,"Edit for context: People are calling me an ungrateful jerk. The last time they got me a gift without talking to me about it, it was a pair of high-quality noise cancelling headphones. I got myself those headphones a day before my birthday and met up with them while wearing those headphones. That year, we all agreed it was a funny but frustrating experience that none of us want to ever repeat. 


Hello everybody!

I have ADHD and I struggle with receiving gifts, if that's a thing. Nobody can ever get me a gift that I actually enjoy because I never wait to get something I really want and consider useful. 

My birthday is coming up, and people have started asking me the (dreadful) question ""What do you want for your birthday?"". I don't really want experiences, vouchers or money. At some point I almost got myself a GoPro but reached the conclusion that I would be excited about it for 2 days and then forget about it because I'm not big on physical activities so I told the to absolutely not get me one. 

I have been looking into getting a SteamDeck recently, but I already have a pretty good gaming PC, which I don't use. I also think it would be above their budget, which I'm guessing would be 300-400$. I also have a PS5, but I'm not fancying any game at the moment. I also have pretty much any piece of technology I could wish for and a good coffee machine.

Oganisers, calendars, and books are not really my thing.

I've had my hand grinder Timemore C2 Chestnut for about 3 years now. Everything was fine until like 2 months ago. I noticed that coffee got progressively more bitter without changing grind size. When I brew V60 the drawdown time is very very long. It doesn't change even when I set grind size to coarse. It produces coffee that not only is bitter, but also sour. It's just impossible to set the grinder to produce somewhat drinkable coffee.

I wonder - what might be the problem? Is it just the way it is with grinders over time? Is it damaged?  
Note: I cleaned the burrs and insides of the grinder many times. It's clean.

Water - bottled ones, changed from low mineralisation to high, same result.

What do you think? Is it time to get a new one?

While I am very happy with the machine/coffee it makes I am looking for an upgrade. There’s a few things I’d like to have improved/ would like the new machine to have:

1) better steam wand. The steam wand does its job, but it’s annoying to keep clean in comparison to rounder wands.
2) higher clearance. The 820 can fit espresso-cups and smaller flat white cups. That’s it. I would like to be able to fit latte glasses to be able to experiment with iced drinks.
3) some more functionality like PID, better OPV and flow control if possible. 
4) the quick mill is really easy to service, repair and mod, so I would like to have that option here as well. 
5) would prefer a thermoblock/boiler combo or a thermoblock, personally not too bothered to upgrade to an e61 machine, unless people suggest otherwise.
6) the quickmill uses their own portafilter and filterbaskets which means I can’t use EMS baskets, preferably I’d like a 58,5mm machine where those can fit.

I have looked around and the Gaggia classic or Turin Legato seem like decent options for a new machine. I am happy to get recommendations for good second hand options too!

My Laughland Review,"Teeth whitening is one of those things I’ve always thought about but kept putting off. Professional treatments seemed too expensive, and the DIY options I tried didn’t give me the results I wanted. So when I read about **Laughland teeth whitening** and saw that it combined professional-level ingredients with an easy-to-use LED mouthpiece, I decided to give it a shot. Here’s how it went and everything I learned.

# Why I Decided to Try Laughland

Years of coffee, tea, and the occasional glass of wine had definitely left their mark. My smile wasn’t as bright as it used to be, and I felt a little self-conscious about it. I wanted a product that wasn’t just another gimmick and wouldn’t leave me with painful sensitivity. Laughland’s dentist-formulated whitening gel and promise of results in six days caught my attention.

# What’s in the Laughland Whitening Kit?

The kit came with everything I needed:

1. **Whitening Gel Pens**: These made it easy to apply the gel precisely where I needed it.
2. **LED Mouthpiece**: This light helps activate the whitening gel for faster, more even results.
3. **Clear Instructions**: The step-by-step guide was simple and easy to follow.

The overall packaging felt premium, and everything looked well thought out—no confusing parts or messy applications.

# How to Use Laughland Teeth Whitening

The process was surprisingly straightforward and took just 10 minutes per session:

1. **Brush and Dry**: Start with clean, dry teeth.
2. **Apply the Gel**: Use the pen to coat your teeth evenly with the whitening gel.
3. **Insert the LED Mouthpiece**: Turn on the light, pop it in, and let it work for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse**: After removing the mouthpiece, rinse your mouth and clean the device.

I liked that it only took 10 minutes—it fit perfectly into my nightly routine while I caught up on social media or watched a show.

# My Experience: Day-by-Day Progress

* **Day 1**: No visible changes after the first session, but my teeth felt cleaner.
* **Day 3**: I noticed subtle improvements—my teeth looked brighter, and the stains from coffee were starting to fade.
* **Day 6**: By the final session, my teeth were visibly whiter—around 6–7 shades lighter. The results looked natural, not overdone or artificial.

What really stood out was that I had **no sensitivity**. Whitening strips have always left me with sharp pains when eating or drinking cold foods, but this gel was gentle throughout the process.

# What Makes Laughland Different?

After trying multiple teeth whitening products in the past, I realized that Laughland stood out in several ways:

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel**: This gel was made with ingredients designed to lift stains without damaging enamel.
2. **LED Light Activation**: The LED mouthpiece speeds up the whitening process and ensures even coverage.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Ingredients**: The whitening gel is stored in a temperature-controlled facility, so it maintains its strength, unlike other gels that can degrade over time.

# How Laughland Compares to Other Whitening Products

I’ve tried a few other teeth whitening methods over the years, and here’s how Laughland stacked up:

* **Whitening Strips**: These left my teeth feeling sensitive and gave uneven results.
* **Whitening Toothpaste**: Good for preventing stains but not strong enough to remove existing discoloration.
* **Professional Whitening Treatments**: Effective but expensive and often caused post-treatment sensitivity.

Laughland gave me professional-level results without the pain or the high price tag.

# Common Questions About Laughland Teeth Whitening

Here are a few questions I had before starting and what I learned from my experience:

1. **Does it damage enamel?** No. The gel is designed to remove stains without harming your enamel.
2. **Does it work on older stains?** Yes! It worked on both recent and older discoloration.
3. **How long do the results last?** It depends on your habits. Avoiding staining foods and drinks can help maintain the brightness for several months.

# Tips for the Best Results

1. **Stick to the Routine**: Consistency is key. Make sure to complete all six sessions.
2. **Avoid Staining Foods**: Cut back on coffee, tea, and red wine during the whitening process to maximize results.
3. **Maintain Oral Hygiene**: Regular brushing and flossing will help keep your teeth looking bright.

# Final Thoughts

Laughland teeth whitening exceeded my expectations. It was easy to use, didn’t take much time, and delivered noticeable results in less than a week. The fact that I didn’t experience any sensitivity was a game-changer for me.

If you’ve been hesitant to try at-home whitening because of sensitivity or lackluster results from other products, this might be the kit that changes your mind. While it’s not a replacement for professional whitening if you need dramatic results immediately, it’s a fantastic option for gradual, natural-looking improvements.

How to Choose the Perfect Kitchen Gadget as a Gift
--------------------------------------------------

Finding the right kitchen gadget as a gift can be a delightful yet daunting task. With so many options available, you might wonder how to select something that will not only be useful but also bring joy to the recipient. Here’s a guide to help you choose the perfect kitchen gadget gift that fits any cooking enthusiast, whether they are seasoned chefs or beginners.

### Understand Their Cooking Style

The first step in selecting a kitchen gift is to consider the recipient’s cooking style. Do they enjoy baking, grilling, or maybe preparing gourmet meals? Each of these activities requires different tools. For instance:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-gifts  
  
- **Baking:** Look for gadgets like silicone baking mats, measuring cups, or a quality kitchen scale.
- **Grilling:** Consider tools such as grill mats, meat thermometers, or a set of durable grilling utensils.
- **Culinary Adventures:** For those who love trying new recipes, think about items like a spiralizer for veggies or a Japanese mandoline slicer.

### Consider Their Kitchen Space

Another critical aspect is the available kitchen space. A compact gadget is ideal for someone with limited counter space. Options like handheld food processors or collapsible measuring cups can be both fun and functional. On the other hand, if they have plenty of storage and counter area, you might opt for larger items, such as a multi-cooker or a high-quality stand mixer.

### Think About Their Skill Level

The skill level of the recipient can greatly influence your choice. Here are suggestions based on skills:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-gifts  
  
- **Beginners:** Choose user-friendly gadgets like a simple can opener, basic chef knife, or a set of colorful, non-slip cutting boards.
- **Intermediate Cooks:** Consider gadgets like an immersion blender or a quality vegetable peeler to enhance their cooking experience.
- **Advanced Chefs:** Look for high-end gadgets such as a sous-vide cooker or a gourmet knife set for their sophisticated culinary techniques.

### Prioritize Quality Over Quantity

When selecting a kitchen gadget, focus on quality. A well-made product will last longer and provide a better cooking experience, making it a worthy gift. Look for brands known for durability and performance. Check reviews and ratings to ensure you are investing in a high-quality item. This not only benefits the recipient but also demonstrates your thoughtfulness in selecting a gift they will appreciate.

### Select a Gadget with Unique Features

Gadgets that offer something a little unique can enhance the cooking experience. From multi-purpose tools to innovative designs, these can make cooking feel more special. For instance:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-gifts  
  
- **Multi-Functional Gadgets:** Tools like all-in-one egg cookers or peelers that slice and chop can save time and space.
- **Eco-Friendly Options:** Consider bamboo utensils or silicone storage bags that align with sustainable living.
- **Smart Gadgets:** Look for smart thermometers or kitchen scales that connect to apps for those tech-savvy chefs.

### Set a Budget

Before diving into your search, it’s wise to set a budget. Kitchen gadgets can vary widely in price, so knowing how much you want to spend will streamline your options. Keep in mind that thoughtful gifts do not always have to be expensive. There are many affordable yet impressive gadgets that will delight the recipient.

### Personalize Your Gift

To truly make your gift stand out, consider the option of personalization. Engraved cooking utensils or custom aprons can elevate an ordinary gadget to something memorable. This little touch shows that you put in the extra effort, making your gift thoughtful and unique.

1i6i1xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1i6i1xp/little_monkey_game/,little monkey game,"— This time, you screwed up, pal.  
— Forgive me... — the man groaned.  
— You left a huge debt with me, buddy. And Uncle João...  
— I'll pay everything, for God's sake!

There were nearly five guys armed with rifles pointed at my head, standing beside a truck with the casino's logo. The logo featured a little monkey holding cash and laughing. It was funny and terrifying at the same time. Cute, maybe, but not so much now, while I'm stuck in this situation, deep in a thicket in Rio de Janeiro.

We were near a motel still under reconstruction. You could see the roof where the hookers used to hang out, still partially charred. This place was infamous for being where they brought people to be executed. Believe me, here in Brazil, that’s how things work: one misstep, and you're dead.

I glanced at the damp ground; it had rained heavily last week.  
— Pal, you're in deep shit. You know that, right? No need for me to spell it out.

I’ve always liked gambling, ever since I was a kid. It was an addiction. After my mom died of cancer, it only got worse. Her pain seemed to fuel my habit, like it was my fault somehow. I bet everything on the online casino. I didn’t even know they had a branch here in Brazil... and somehow, they tracked me down.

Now, here I am in this thicket. I gambled away everything, even what I didn’t have. I lost my mother’s house—or at least what was left of it.  
— Please, I have kids to raise... and a wife! — I pleaded, trying to appeal to their empathy.

They laughed like it was a joke.  
— We’ll give you a chance, — said an old, dark-skinned man holding a rifle.  
— If you die, you can’t make us money, you get me?  
— I get it, I get it.  
— You’re gonna pay us, whether you like it or not.

I heard heavy footsteps inside their truck. It sounded like something huge was moving around in there.  
— I think you're ready to meet Uncle João.  
— Who's Uncle João? — I asked, terrified.

The man smirked and called toward the truck.  
— Uncle João!

Something emerged from the truck: a towering bald man, over two meters tall, with a massive head. He looked like a monster. His arms were enormous, like they could crush me without effort.

— So, this is the mutt that owes me? — he said in a voice both deep and oddly high-pitched, strange and terrifying.

He reminded me of the giant black man from *The Green Mile.*  
— You owe me, pal.  
— Please, I'll pay, I promise! I promise! — I begged desperately.

He gave a lopsided smile, the kind that makes your spine freeze.  
— I hear you have a pretty little daughter.

My heart stopped for a second. How did he know that?  
— Her name's Ana, right? Goes to the municipal school in Rio de Janeiro, the one with the red building and yellow uniforms. Your son studies there too, doesn’t he? Manuel, am I right?

I felt a chill down my spine, like my soul had left my body. I almost had a heart attack on the spot. Every word he spoke in that deep voice felt like a ton of bricks.  
— Your house is nice too, you know? The one with the red walls and electric fence... I mean, *my* house now, right? You get me, yeah?

I could barely breathe. Reality felt like a nightmare.

— Run, you piece of shit, now! — he shouted with such intensity that I wished I could disappear.

I got home, my heart still racing, and looked at my 5-year-old daughter, Ana, sleeping in her room. Manuel, my son, was there too.

I tried to scrape together the money to pay Uncle João any way I could. I explored every possibility. I was mentally prepared to rob someone if it came to that. The debt was 50,000 reais. I knew I’d never be able to gather that amount in time.

The next day, I picked up my daughter from school, and my son too. At every corner, I looked around nervously, paranoid, imagining that two-meter-tall monster might be lurking. Maybe his goons were watching me.

Suddenly, I saw a boy riding a bike. He was painfully ugly, with a head that seemed like one of those microcephaly cases. The boy was tanned, burnt by the sun, popping wheelies on his bike while yelling:  
— Blim, blim, blim! Monkey! Monkey! Blim! Blim!

He stared straight into my eyes with a smile that seemed to pierce my soul. That laugh reminded me of the victory sound in the little monkey game at the online casino. Blim, blim, monkey! Monkey, blim, blim!

My head started spinning. The sound was hypnotic, as if it wanted to consume me. For a moment, I thought: Does this kid know something?

I shook my head and pushed the thought away. It was impossible. A kid with that face, that head, couldn’t possibly be involved in something like this. The casino was famous; he was just mimicking the sound of the machine’s victory tune.

I picked up Ana and Manuel and took them home—the same house I inherited from my mom after her death. On the way, all I could think about was how I’d have to tell Joana. How was I going to say I lost the house and owed 50,000 reais because of a stupid little monkey game?

When we arrived, I opened the gate. The house was surrounded by tall walls and topped with an electric fence, like so many others here in Brazil. Around here, that’s almost standard: tall walls and electric fences.

As soon as I walked in, Joana came to greet me.  
— You’re home early, love. — She kissed my cheek with that warm smile that made it seem like everything was still okay.  
— I’m making your pasta.

Joana was dark-skinned, with radiant skin and long black hair. A beautiful mulatta. Even with all the turmoil in my head, it was impossible not to notice how she still had that natural way of calming me.  
— Why do you look so strange, love?

I swallowed hard. I almost blurted everything out right then, but I froze. It wasn’t the right time. I need more time, I thought.

I saw Manuel playing with Ana. He had the same brown hair as me and fair, almost pale skin. Ana, on the other hand, took after her mother, with her darker complexion, but her straight hair was like mine. They seemed so innocent, so unaware of the chaos about to erupt.  
— Dad, my teacher taught me the alphabet today! — Manuel said excitedly.

I pretended to be interested, smiling and asking about the letters, but my mind was elsewhere.

When we finally went to bed, I was woken by Manuel crying. He was standing next to my bed, clutching his pillow, his eyes wide open.  
— Dad... there’s a monster in my closet.

I sighed. Kid stuff—fear of the dark, the edge of a shelf, shadows on the ceiling. I got up and went with him to his room. I slowly opened the wardrobe doors, letting him see there was no one inside.  
— See, champ? No need to be scared. There’s no one here, nothing in the closet. Go back to sleep, okay? — I said, trying to sound calm, though my voice trembled slightly.

Manuel stayed put, looking at me like I was the crazy one. His eyes were wide, almost teary, but he didn’t blink.  
— I saw him, Dad. He was watching me from the closet. I smelled him... He wasn’t wearing any clothes, Daddy.

His words hit me like a punch to the gut. My entire body went cold, but I tried not to show it. I took a deep breath, feeling a strange heaviness in the air, and ran a hand over his head.  
— It was just a dream, son. Just a nightmare. None of it was real, okay?

Manuel didn’t reply, but his expression said otherwise. He believed every word of what he’d just told me.

As I left the room, I caught a strange smell. It was subtle but unsettling: a mix of sweat and something worse. Maybe feces. The odor was stifling, like it was seeping from the walls.

I glanced back at Manuel, who was watching me intently.  
— Champ, you didn’t sleep with Rex, did you? — I asked, trying to brush off the discomfort. Rex, our dog, sometimes had a habit of sneaking in and causing trouble.  
— No, Dad.

His response was quick and curt, and something about his tone unsettled me.

I went back to bed that night, but sleep brought no relief. I had horrible dreams—the kind you can’t quite remember but leave you shaken all the same. 

 

that heavy feeling lingered. Only one dream stayed etched in my mind, like a scar.

I was in Rio de Janeiro, walking along the avenues. Usually bursting with life, they were now deserted—no cars, no people, not a single sound. I glanced at my watch: 8 a.m. Even so, it felt as if the world had simply vanished. I kept walking until I saw a man sitting on the sidewalk.

He looked swollen, his skin red like a chili pepper. He was coughing incessantly, spitting up something that resembled blood. Red phlegm dripped from his mouth, and his eyes… God, his eyes were a deep red, like they were about to burst.

I woke up with a start, drenched in cold sweat, my heart racing.

I got out of bed and headed to the kitchen. Joana had made breakfast and was humming softly. I tried to smile at her, but my mind was elsewhere. I decided I needed a shower before tackling the day and figuring out how to deal with Uncle João.

I walked to the bathroom. When I opened the door, the smell hit me like a punch in the face. It was a brutal stench—a mixture of feces and death that clung to my throat.

Holding my breath, I opened the door slowly. The light was off, so I reached for the switch. When I pressed it, I felt something slimy on my finger. My instincts screamed at me, but I still turned on the light.

What I saw made me freeze.

The entire bathroom was… smeared with shit. It wasn’t just on the floor—no. Feces covered the walls, the ceiling, the mirror. Huge chunks were splattered everywhere, as if hurled with force. The sink was clogged with a thick, black liquid.

It was so much filth that I started wondering how any human being could produce such a mess. It was simply impossible. It looked like the scene of a fecal apocalypse.

I glanced at my finger, the one I had used to flip the switch. It was coated in a dark substance, black with brownish hues. Just looking at it made my stomach churn. As I was about to scream, something even worse caught my attention.

On the far wall, in massive, grotesque letters written in black shit, were the words:  
""Where's my money, buddy?""

The words seemed to pulse. Giant. Imposing. Almost alive.

I knew I had to do something, and the only thing that came to mind was calling the police. Even knowing that, in Brazil, the police often do more harm than good, I had no other choice. The situation was entirely out of my control.

But every thought about what was happening made my stomach churn like a whirlpool. The idea that that psychotic giant might have been hiding in my son’s closet gave me chills. My hands trembled as I picked up the phone. My legs felt so weak I thought I might faint.

I took a deep breath and dialed the number.  
— What's your emergency? — the operator asked in a monotonous voice, as if it were just another routine call.

I started explaining everything. I talked about the casino, the debt, and even mentioned Uncle João, the giant man who had turned my life into a nightmare. But the moment I said his name, there was a pause on the other end of the line.

— Hello? — I asked, thinking the call had dropped.

Then the operator responded, but now his voice was hesitant, almost nervous:  
— I’m sorry, sir. Please don’t call us again… And stop playing pranks.

Before I could say anything, he hung up on me.

My mind was in chaos, worse than before. Nausea surged, and I almost threw up right there. I thought about telling Joana everything, but...  I knew that if Joana went into the bathroom and saw that mess, it would be impossible to hide the truth. And what if he decided to kill my children? This guy was a psychopath, a lunatic. What kind of person does something like that?

I washed my finger repeatedly, as if trying to erase the disgusting feeling of having touched the shit-covered light switch. I sat down for breakfast, trying to act normal. The smell of fried eggs and freshly brewed coffee filled the kitchen, but I could barely taste anything. I was in shock.

Joana and the kids were chatting excitedly about their day at school. They talked about teachers, games, and the alphabet, but I could barely hear them. My mind was trapped in the nightmare of the bathroom.

Then I saw it: a massive shadow emerging from the other room.

My body froze. Only I seemed to notice it.

The giant, bald man stepped out of the darkness. His face bore a maniacal smile, as if he knew he controlled everything. In his hands, he held a poster. He lifted it, and the words—written in shit—gleamed under the light:  
""Where’s my money, buddy?""

My heart stopped. The world seemed to freeze in that moment. He was in my house. Maybe he’d been there since the night before. But how? How had he gotten past the walls? How had no one heard anything?

My mind raced for answers, but the terror only grew.

Then he raised another poster, even more grotesque. He was completely naked, with an enormous, smooth butt that looked like an old refrigerator. As he stared at me, he started straining, and feces began to stream down his legs, splattering onto the floor with a wet, nauseating sound that only I seemed to hear.

I nearly vomited.

The new poster, written in shaky, oversized letters, read:  
""I’m coming for you, buddy.""

My body froze. The smell of shit and sweat seemed to fill the room, though Joana and the kids remained oblivious to what was happening. It was as if I were trapped in an alternate reality where only I could see this monstrosity.

— What’s wrong, love? Why do you look like that? — Joana asked, breaking the moment.

— You’re so pale. What’s going on?

I wanted to respond, but no words came out. Before I could react, Uncle João stepped forward and bellowed:  
— GOOD AFTERNOON!

His voice was so deep it seemed to shake the walls.

Joana froze, as did the kids. Even Rex, our miniature pinscher, stopped barking and ran off to hide.

— Joana… what the hell is this?! — she asked, incredulous, looking at me.

Desperate, I tried to lie, stammering:  
— Joana… this is… my cousin. He’s here to visit us…

She looked at me like I’d lost my mind.  
— Cousin?! This guy looks like the giant from Jack and the Beanstalk! He’s a colossus! And he STINKS! Where the hell did he come from?! The depths of hell?!

I didn’t know what to say. My voice came out as a whisper:  
— Joana… Joana…

Uncle João laughed, his laughter rumbling like a roar.  
— Here’s the deal, madam. Your shitty husband owes me money. A LOT of money. I want my cash. He gambled it all on the little monkey game… and lost.

Joana turned to me with a look of pure rage. I could barely meet her eyes. The kids sat in absolute silence, paralyzed with fear.

— How much? — she asked, her voice trembling with anger and disbelief.

Uncle João stepped closer, and his stench became even more unbearable.  
— Fifty thousand reais… plus the house.

She shook her head as if she couldn’t believe what she was hearing. Her expression shifted from confusion to pure fury.

— Either you pay with money, — Uncle João said with a sinister smile, — ...or you pay with blood, brother. You get it, don’t you?

— I won’t be able to get the money in time! — I replied, my voice cracking, my legs trembling beneath me.

Uncle João paused for a moment, staring me down. His eyes, red and piercing like those of a demon, gleamed with something I can only describe as pure evil. He let out a low, disdainful chuckle and stepped closer.

— Is that so? — he whispered, but his voice echoed like thunder. — One more thing... why did you call the cops?

My mouth went dry, and I couldn’t answer. He continued:  
— If there’s a next time... — he paused, the smile vanishing from his face. — I’ll kill your little girl. Or worse, brother... *CABIDE.*

I had no idea what he meant by ""cabide"" (hanger), but just hearing the word made my stomach churn.

Joana, who hadn’t spoken until now, looked at me with horror and fear. The giant was in our home, as out of place as a nightmare come to life.

He then turned his attention to Miguel, my son, who was holding a slice of bread with mortadella. Uncle João’s voice boomed again, now with a tone that was almost playful but still terrifying:  
— What are you eating there, kid?

Miguel answered softly, on the verge of tears:  
— Bread... and mortadella, sir.

— SPEAK UP, YOU LITTLE DEVIL! — he roared so loudly that Rex, our miniature pinscher, began to whimper. Rex, who barked at everything and everyone, now cowered silently in the corner, utterly terrified of Uncle João.

Miguel started crying, his sobs stifled and barely audible. The giant moved closer to him, taking the bread from his small hands with his massive, filthy fingers. The stench was unbearable, as though it had a life of its own, filling every corner of the room.

Joana covered her mouth with her hand, unable to believe what she was seeing.

Then, with no shame at all, Uncle João began to lower his pants.

His enormous, smooth, shiny butt, reminiscent of an old refrigerator, came into view. It was as disproportionate as the rest of his gigantic body. He turned slightly, making sure everyone had a clear view. Joana covered her mouth in horror while Miguel cried uncontrollably.

— HERE WE GO! — he roared as if about to perform a grand feat.

He squatted slightly, arching his back.

The sound came first: a wet, long fart, like the exhaust of a broken-down car. Then, with a wet, heavy plop, the shit began to fall. It was thick, almost black, streaked with brown, as though his diet—or something more sinister—was horribly wrong.

Each splatter made a disgusting sound as it hit the bread, like a bucket of mud being poured onto ceramic tiles. The texture was pasty, but occasionally more solid chunks fell, like clumps breaking off a wall of dried mud.

The smell, unbearable before, now seemed alive. My eyes started watering involuntarily as I saw Joana turn her face away, clutching both her nose and her stomach. Miguel stood frozen, his face wet with tears, as the grotesque act continued.

Uncle João strained, letting out small grunts of effort. For a moment, his face looked satisfied, as if relieved. He let out another loud fart and laughed—a deep, mocking sound that seemed to ridicule all of us.

When he was done, he lifted the bread, now unrecognizable. A thick layer of shit covered it completely, and the stench was even more intense now that it was exposed.

He looked at Miguel and, in his deep, thunderous voice, said:  
— E

Miguel sobbed, calling for his mother with a trembling voice:  
— Mama...

— EAT IT NOW, YOU LITTLE DEMON! — Uncle João roared, his voice so loud and deep it seemed to make the walls tremble.

The shout was so powerful that even Rex, our pinscher, began crying again. Rex, who barked at everything and everyone, was reduced to a terrified dog cowering in the corner.

Uncle João, his face twisted in insane rage, grabbed Miguel’s face with his massive hand, which looked capable of crushing anything. He pressed the shit-covered bread against the boy’s small face, rubbing it forcefully, spreading the nauseating stench onto his skin.

— EAT! EAT! EAT, YOU LITTLE SHIT! YOU SON OF A BITCH! — he bellowed, spit flying from his mouth as Miguel cried even louder, struggling to escape the monstrous grip.

Joana, who had been frozen in fear, suddenly moved. In a desperate act, she ran to the kitchen and returned with a knife in her hand.

But, as if he had eyes in the back of his head, the giant spun around quickly and grabbed her by the neck with a single hand. He lifted her like a rag doll, and Joana began flailing, trying to escape the immense grip that was choking her.

I fell to my knees, crying and begging:  
— PLEASE! PLEASE, LET HER GO!

Uncle João finally released Joana, who collapsed to the floor, gasping and trembling. Ana was crying uncontrollably, screaming for her mother:  
— Don’t kill my mommy! Please don’t kill my mommy!

He turned to me with a cruel smile, his eyes gleaming with pure sadism.  
— Then you’ll eat it now, in his place, buddy.

My stomach churned. Just looking at the grotesque scene made me feel sick, but I didn’t have time to react. Uncle João grabbed me by the neck with his gigantic hand, lifting me off the ground as if I weighed nothing.

He brought the shit-covered bread close to my face and pressed it against my mouth. The stench was unbearable, so intense it felt like it was corroding my throat from the inside.  
— EAT IT, YOU BASTARD! — he yelled as I struggled, but it was futile.

I was forced to open my mouth, and the bitter, rancid taste of the filth overwhelmed me. My body reacted immediately. I vomited on the spot, the acidic liquid mixing with the disgusting bread, but Uncle João didn’t stop.  
— EAT THE VOMIT TOO! — he roared, shoving the bread and vomit into my mouth with his enormous hands.

Meanwhile, Joana grabbed the children and ran upstairs. She might have been calling the police or simply trying to escape the nightmare.

It didn’t take long. Uncle João’s roar echoed through the house like a lion’s growl:  
— WHO CALLED THE COPS?!

Minutes after Joana made the call, he already knew.  
— YOU WHORE! — he screamed, his voice so loud it felt like it shook the walls.

How did he find out so quickly?

When night fell, Uncle João returned. He burst into our bedroom, slamming the door open. His massive head scraped the ceiling, and the man looked like a giant—at least two meters tall. He was the largest man I’d ever seen, like a living tank.

But to our surprise and horror, he was completely naked, filthy, and reeking...

The unbearable stench permeated the air. Without saying a word, he lay down beside us. Joana was already on the verge of insanity. She had called the police, but received the same evasive response as I did: nothing would be done. Could the police have some connection to this monstrosity? That question pounded in my mind.

Suddenly, he grabbed me by the arms, still naked, and began forcing me against him. He whispered things in my ear while doing that horrible act, all in front of Joana. He didn't stop all night. He forced her to watch without looking away. With every moment, his nauseating smell made the situation even more unbearable.

— If you close your eyes, I'll bring your kids here to watch everything... and I'll crap on them too! — he threatened with a disturbing smile.

When morning came, I was exhausted but still alive. Uncle João was still in bed, naked, sprawled like a demon resting after a night of chaos. The smell was unbearable. The hardened filth on his skin seemed to exude even more now, as if it had saturated the air. In the following days, everything got worse—I had brought the very devil into my home.

I couldn't walk. My body was broken, physically and emotionally. He had done things to me I never thought anyone could do. My body ached in places I didn't even know could hurt, but the worst pain was inside me.

I couldn't look at myself in the mirror. The disgust I felt for myself was overwhelming. How did I get to this point? Did I deserve this? Maybe. All of this was my fault.

Uncle João now seemed like part of the house, an unwanted member of the family. He went downstairs to the kitchen, naked, dragging his massive, stinking body as if nothing had happened.

Joana was there, making breakfast. Her face was a mask of hatred and contempt. She blamed me for everything, and rightly so. All this misery was my fault, and that only made everything more unbearable.

She set the plates on the table, and I could barely face her. The weight of shame crushed me. There were no excuses for what I had done, and her gaze said it all: deep down, she wanted me gone. Maybe even dead.

Uncle João, with his deep, raspy voice, interrupted the silence:  
— Give me that.

He grabbed the plate Joana had just placed on the table and began eating like an animal, spilling food everywhere while laughing softly. The scene was grotesque. He seemed to savor not just the food but the sheer fact of being there, in total control.

Joana said nothing. She just looked at me with eyes full of hatred and contempt. I had no words.

As he chewed, he let out a belch so loud that Rex barked nervously, but even the dog knew better than to challenge Uncle João.

He demanded Miguel’s plate and ate it. Then he devoured Ana Júlia’s food as well. In fact, he ate almost all the food in the house. That creature ate like a lion, endlessly.

One night, Miguel screamed, saying there was a monster in the closet again. My heart nearly stopped. I ran to see what it was, and to my horror, I found Uncle João. He was naked, completely naked, crouched in the corner of the room. At first, I couldn’t see him in the darkness, but before I even turned on the light, his white teeth gleamed in the dark, accompanied by a disturbing laugh. His insane eyes stared at me. The scene was terrifying, like something out of a nightmare.

— Want to sleep in Daddy’s room? — I asked, trying to stay calm.  
— You won’t! — he shouted, like a wild animal.

That hoarse, animalistic scream froze me. I couldn’t react. I ended up leaving my son with that horrifying abomination. Maybe you’ll judge me, but you don’t know Uncle João. He is the definition of unpredictable, insane, and intimidating. I started questioning, “Is he human? No, that’s impossible.” And the neighbors? How had they not called the police after all the screaming, crying, and terrifying noises?

The next morning, I went to check on Miguel. He was walking strangely, his eyes wide open. Limping as well. My heart sank.

— Lie on my lap! — Uncle João ordered the boy, his voice laced with twisted authority.

He forced my son to lie on his lap. Joana, overtaken by furious despair, grabbed a knife again. Her eyes were wide, her breath heavy as she charged toward him.

But before she could get close, he reacted. It was as if he had eyes in the back of his head. In a swift, brutal move, he grabbed Joana and hurled her against the wall. The impact was harsh, and for a moment, I thought he had killed her.

It didn’t stop there. He grabbed her by the face and, with a violent strike, broke some of her teeth. As Joana screamed in pain, he pulled out pliers that seemed to appear from nowhere. With chilling precision, he yanked another tooth out of her mouth, all in front of the children, who watched in utter horror.

The cruelty seemed limitless. He took the teeth he had extracted and placed them in Miguel’s hand.

— Eat. Now. — he said, his voice cold and merciless.

Miguel cried, his entire body trembling. With a lump in his throat and tears streaming down his face, he obeyed. The boy swallowed his mother’s teeth while Joana sobbed in pain and despair.

— Next time anyone tries something against me, I’ll rip your husband’s dick off and shove it down your son’s throat. Got it, you worthless hanger? — he said, laughing maniacally.

Joana could only sob, overwhelmed by pain and humiliation. Her parents were on their way, and canceling their visit was impossible. There was no way out. Uncle João, on the other hand, seemed calm. He muttered something as if praying, but a smile lingered at the corner of his lips.  
— I’ll hide until it all blows over — he said, laughing, before disappearing for the first time.

Hours dragged on in silence. When Joana’s parents stopped answering our calls, we started to think they had given up. A strange sense of relief washed over us, though fear still loomed in the air.

Then, at three in the morning, he returned. He appeared in the living room, smiling oddly, as if nothing had happened.  
— I’m cooking today. — he announced.

No one objected. Everyone agreed, though with downcast eyes.  
— Uncle João, are you a good cook? — someone attempted to say, perhaps trying to appease him.  
— Shut up, slut. — he snapped, not even looking.

Soon, the smell of food filled the house. A strong aroma of pork drifted through the rooms. There was something acrid in the air, something nauseating, but no one dared to question it.

When the food reached the table, everyone ate in silence. To our surprise, it was good. The flavor was rich, with well-seasoned pork. But Joana, with her injured mouth and broken teeth, could barely chew.  
— Eat, slut. — he ordered, shoving the plate toward her.  
— But... my mouth hurts — she murmured, almost voiceless.

He stared at her for a long moment.

Uncle João punched Joana so hard that the sound echoed through the dining room. The dry, horrifying noise seemed to freeze time. He stood at the center of the table, wearing a feminine apron, a sight that was both comical and profoundly disturbing.  
— You’d better eat dessert, right? — he said in a high, theatrical voice, as if presenting a grotesque performance.

With a slow, almost ceremonial motion, he removed the cloth covering the dish at the center of the table. What was revealed made the air leave my lungs: the heads of Joana’s parents. Their skulls were exposed, as if skinned with brutal precision.

Joana screamed. A primal, guttural sound emerged from her throat, muffled by her broken teeth and the pain consuming every part of her. It was a scream of pure terror, something from beyond comprehension.

Uncle João leaned forward, smiling, as he pointed to the dish.  
— Eat. — he said, the word sounding like a definitive command. — Eat the brains. They’re still raw, but they’re good.

He made us eat Joana’s parents. Even the children were forced. Now he wanted more. He demanded we eat the skulls. Joana was at her limit. Her breathing was ragged, and her eyes seemed lost, as if her soul had abandoned her body.  
— Eat! — he screamed, with a fury that made Rex, the dog, start crying and whimpering again.

But this time, he didn’t stop at yelling. He grabbed Rex with his massive hands and, in one brutal motion, tore him apart as if he were made of paper. The sound was indescribable: the crack of bones, the animal’s death cries, all blending into a macabre symphony.

The children cried, their sobs echoing through the room like small, desperate screams. Their wide eyes were incapable of processing what they had just witnessed.

He turned to me, his face twisted into a maniacal smile.  
— You two eat now, or I’ll do to the little girl the same thing I did to this worthless barking rat.

There was no choice. I took a piece of the skull and brought it to my mouth. The taste was viscous, metallic, and something inside me began to die in that moment. I don’t know if it was worse than eating filth or excrement. Perhaps I discovered the difference at that instant.

Joana, in tears, did the same. She chewed her mother’s skull with a vacant stare. The children, sobbing and trembling, were forced to eat as well.

Uncle João laughed loudly, his voice booming like a distorted thunderclap.

It was as if he had absorbed all the darkness of that place.

— We’re going to spend a lot of time together — he said, smiling. His voice sounded like a death sentence.",1,1737464464.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

","[storefront signs](https://preview.redd.it/a9xmv10ehcee1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a070513b4c9c6b662b9a0313f2a25125448acfad)

When it comes to attracting customers, visibility is everything. Whether you run a coffee shop, boutique, or law office, your storefront sign is one of the most important elements in driving foot traffic to your business. Storefront signs are not just practical—they're powerful marketing tools that can help you stand out, reinforce your brand, and leave a lasting impression on potential customers.

In this blog post, we’ll explore the many reasons why storefront signs are essential for your business and how they can be a game-changer for your success.

# 1. First Impressions Matter

Your storefront sign is often the first point of contact between your business and potential customers. A well-designed sign sets the tone for what customers can expect when they walk through the door. A clear, professional, and visually appealing sign helps convey your business’s personality, values, and level of expertise.

For example, a high-end jewelry store may opt for a sleek, elegant sign with gold or silver accents, conveying luxury and exclusivity. On the other hand, a quirky café might use playful fonts and bright colors to give off a fun, welcoming vibe. Regardless of the style, a good storefront sign communicates to customers who you are and why they should step inside.

# 2. Attract Foot Traffic and Increase Visibility

In a world filled with distractions, you need to find a way to stand out. Storefront signs are one of the most effective ways to grab the attention of passersby. Whether you’re located in a busy urban center or a quiet neighborhood, an eye-catching sign can make all the difference in attracting new customers.

Think of your storefront sign as a silent salesperson—it’s always working, 24/7, to promote your business. Whether it's the middle of the day or the evening, your sign ensures that people can easily find your location. Whether you’re in a busy commercial district or a residential area, a strategically placed, bold sign helps you make a memorable impression on potential customers as they walk or drive by.

# 3. Reinforce Your Brand Identity

A storefront sign is a powerful tool for building and reinforcing your brand identity. Your sign is an extension of your brand, and it should reflect the values and personality of your business. The colors, typography, logo, and materials you choose for your sign should be consistent with your overall branding strategy.

For instance, a tech company may choose a modern, minimalist sign with sleek lettering and neutral tones to emphasize innovation and professionalism. A children’s bookstore might go for a whimsical design with bright colors and playful fonts to attract families and create a fun atmosphere. By ensuring that your storefront sign aligns with your brand, you enhance customer recognition and help your business stand out from the competition.

# 4. Cost-Effective Marketing Tool

One of the key advantages of storefront signs is that they provide long-lasting value with minimal maintenance. Unlike other forms of advertising, such as online ads or print campaigns that require ongoing costs, a storefront sign is a one-time investment that continues to work for you day and night. Once you’ve installed your sign, it’s up and running, drawing attention to your business around the clock.

In comparison to other forms of advertising, such as TV, radio, or digital marketing, storefront signs provide a cost-effective way to reach a local audience. The return on investment (ROI) is high because your sign works continuously, bringing in potential customers who are already in the area. You’re targeting individuals who are passing by and may be ready to purchase or engage with your services right then and there.

# 5. Customization to Fit Your Needs

One of the biggest benefits of storefront signs is their customizability. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach, and the design possibilities are virtually endless. Whether you want a bold, illuminated sign that catches the eye from a distance or a simple, elegant design that blends with the architecture of your building, storefront signs can be tailored to meet your specific needs.

Storefront signs come in a variety of materials—wood, metal, acrylic, vinyl—and can be designed to fit any budget or aesthetic. You can incorporate lighting to ensure your sign is visible at night, or choose a non-illuminated sign for a more traditional look. With endless options for size, color, and design, you can create a storefront sign that perfectly reflects your business and attracts your target audience.

# 6. Directing Customers to Your Door

[Storefront signs](https://baltimoresignsmiths.com/outdoor-signs/storefront-signs/) don’t just help attract customers—they also provide vital information that helps them easily find your business. If you're located in a busy shopping district or multi-tenant building, a storefront sign can guide people to your exact location. This is particularly helpful for customers who may be unfamiliar with the area or navigating a complex with multiple businesses.

For example, if your storefront is inside a shopping plaza, a well-placed sign can direct potential customers to your entrance. Or, if your shop is located in a busy downtown area, a prominent sign can help passersby quickly spot your business from across the street, making it easier for them to walk in.

# 7. A Tool for Seasonal Promotions and Special Offers

Another benefit of storefront signs is their versatility. Not only can they showcase your business’s name and logo, but they can also be used for special promotions, sales, or seasonal events. Whether you’re running a summer sale, promoting a new product, or celebrating a holiday, your storefront sign can be easily updated to communicate current offers.

With features like interchangeable letters, digital displays, or hanging banners, you can quickly update your storefront sign to keep it fresh and relevant. This ensures that your sign remains an effective tool for communicating important messages to customers throughout the year.

# 8. Case Study: How a Storefront Sign Transformed a Business

Let’s look at a real-world example of how a storefront sign can make a significant impact. A local bakery in a small town was struggling to attract new customers. They had great products, but their location was hard to find. After installing a bright, eye-catching sign featuring their logo and a catchy tagline, the bakery’s foot traffic increased by 40% within just a few weeks. The sign not only helped customers find the bakery but also gave it a more professional and established look.

The sign became a local landmark, with people regularly passing by and returning for fresh baked goods. Additionally, the bakery used their sign to promote seasonal treats, drawing in even more customers. The combination of a memorable, attractive sign and strategic promotions contributed to a significant boost in the business’s success.

# Conclusion: Why Your Business Needs a Storefront Sign

Storefront signs are more than just a way to mark your location—they’re essential tools for building your brand, attracting customers, and increasing visibility. A great storefront sign can make a huge difference in how potential customers perceive your business and whether they decide to visit.

Whether you’re starting a new business or refreshing your current signage, investing in a custom storefront sign is one of the smartest marketing decisions you can make. By creating a sign that reflects your brand, draws attention, and provides vital information, you’ll be well on your way to making a lasting impression on customers and growing your business.",1,1737464309.0,u_ComprehensiveScar472,0,1.0,False

Since that day we've had some long talks. Come to find out she's been planning for a couple years. I asked her why she never said anything and she said she gave all she had.

Mind you, there is no abuse of any form, she wants for nothing, we live in an amazing neighborhood, kids are thriving.

I was drinking my coffee this morning and came to realize she's been plotting for at least two years while we laughed, smiled, traveled, celebrated family and career milestones.

The entire time she was plotting. One reason I think is because I just retired from the military so she'll be awarded a good chunk of my retirement.

She's already bought a new bikini and started working out. I begged her for years to workout with me or just generally take care of herself.

She'd always say, ""I'm not a Barbie.""

Feel like I did everything right. Provided, coached all my kids sports teams, put her through college with my GI Bill.

I’m sorry I just need to went because I can’t take this anymore.
Long story short I have had urogenital problems for almost a year now. This started 2 months after I got together with my current boyfriend. Since then I have been to dozens of doctors and I simply cannot get back to normal.
During this time I had e.coli, ureaplasma parvum, atopobium vaginae and multiple yeast infections.
First I only had vaginal symptoms such as pain and discharge but during doxycycline treatment I developed urinary symptoms as well. Since then I cannot go a day without feeling uncomfortable down there either because of my vagina, bladder, urethra or abdomen. (I was STI tested multiple times with PCR via urine, swab and urethra all negative but I just sent away another test today. I also used probiotics orally and vaginally as well as d-mannose, cranberry, herbal remedies, nothing helped. Furthermore I eat clean, no gluten, no dairy, no sugar, no alcohol, no coffee).
Is there a way to do a full reset and try to build everything back up again?
I was thinking about trying out boric acid and after that using probiotic suppositories for an extended period of time.
Any recommendations or insights? I am truly desperate at this point and I am worried that this is something more complex as I might also have Lyme disease and Bartonella but I keep getting dismissed by doctors. I am also being examined by an IC specialist this week.

Edit: we treated ureaplasma at the same time and did not engage in sexual contact during antibiotics and 4 weeks after that. He was also treated for a yeast infection when I tested positive for that. Also, my issues do not resolve if a do not have sex. Throughout all this I went several months without having sex and it did not get better.",5,1737464152.0,Healthyhooha,10,1.0,False

1i6hwad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1i6hwad/celebrity_vs_norwegian_as_solo_sailor/,Celebrity vs Norwegian as solo sailor ,"Last summer I sailed for the first time ever on the Celebrity Ascent on one of the infinite veranda cabins for singles on a cruise on the French and Italian riveras. It was absolutely stunning! The ship, the food, the entertainment, the activities, the excursions, the staff, I could not have asked for more! I ended up meeting some interesting people and had some conversations that I much enjoyed. 

The experience was so amazing that while still on the cruise I booked a back to back Barcelona - Piraeus - Barcelona. The price per night was too good to pass up!

Then, just a few days ago I came back from a cruise to the Canary Islands to escape the winter cold on the Celebrity Infinity. As there are no single cabins on that ship, I had to pay for a double, but it is what it is. Despite the ship having been to the dry dock in summer, the cabin felt largely untouched. 

The cruise itself was lovely, but the buffet did fill up for lunch and dinner and it seemed that there wasn't a ""quiet time"" to go unless it was really early, and then dash for the buffet once it opened. 

The activities were nice and so were the bars. The theatre shows were all good and the staff were absolutely excellent! 

However, the price per night, for what felt like an inferior product, did sting a bit. 

Also, Celebrity doesn't have too many itineraries in Europe and if I can help it, I like to board from the Spanish mainland, as I can get there by train, which is much more convenient and cheaper than flying. 

So I looked around and came upon Norwegian and their solo studio cabins. The price point is very attractive and from what I see, while small, the cabin offers all the necessities plus access to the solo lounge with a coffee machine that makes espresso'ish coffee, so that's a win. 

I will be sailing in the Med in October on the Breakaway. I saw that I couldn't prepay gratuities, but I did get the free at sea drinks package, that seems comparable to the premium drinks package on Celebrity (?). On Celebrity this was always an upgrade for me, as I would only be able to get the basic drinks and WiFi package included at the time of booking. 

Are there any other things I need to consider when sailing with Norwegian as compared to Celebrity? Different costs structures; included/not included? Quality of activities, excursions, entertainment, spa treatments? Times when meals are served? WiFi allotments? 

Any advice is much appreciated! ",1,1737463940.0,Cruise,9,0.6,False

For many of us (me included!), binging and other unhelpful behaviours are used as relief from negative emotions. To move ourselves from ""I'm not binging but it's all I can think about"" to ""I'm not binging and I don't miss it either"", we need to find other ways to deal with those emotions.

There are two ways to deal with emotions: emotional regulation (""Time In"") and emotional discharge (""Time Out"").

\*\***The more you invest in Time In, the less often you're going to need those Time Outs.** Like everything, the more you maintain your emotional needs, the less often they’re going to need emergency care!!\*\*

**Time In is the things that we do** ***before*** **our emotions become overwhelming.** It's emotional maintenance. Time In includes things like:

* meditation (CoSaWe04)
* journaling
* listening to music
* reading (CoSaWe04)
* walking / yoga / swimming / running / other exercise (zodiahck, HappyVanillaBean, CoSaWe04, Future-Designer-6855, Anybody\_Minimum)
* maintaining friendships and spending time with loved ones (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty, HappyVanillaBean, Future-Designer-6855)
* eating delicious and nutritious food to sustain ourselves on a regular basis (not over-restricting!), and staying hydrated (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty, HappyVanillaBean, Future-Designer-6855)
* checking in with ourselves and paying attention to our feelings and needs
* coffee dates with ourselves (Anybody\_Minimum)
* checking in on loved ones / favourite people (zodiahck, Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* phone-free playtime with kids (MSH0123)
* listening to recovery podcasts (smokyoat)
* making sure to get enough sleep (guavatc, HappyVanillaBean)
* taking breaks from work or studies (guavatc)
* Colouring, Cross-stitching, General crafting (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* extended skincare routine, with scented candles and soft music (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* Listening to audiobooks (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* Reading something comforting, usually something I’ve read 100 times before! (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* Planning engaging activities or routines (HappyVanillaBean)
* Arts and crafts (CoSaWe04, Anybody\_Minimum)
* oils on the pillow at night (Future-Designer-6855)
* food journaling (Future-Designer-6855)

**Time Out is the things we do when our emotions are high and we need to discharge them.** It's emotional 911. For most emotions, it usually takes about 20 minutes for discharge to occur (of course there will be exceptions, for example if someone you love has passed away you're not going to discharge those emotions in 20 minutes). Binging is a form of Time Out, a very effective one but also one that creates its own problems... More helpful types of Time Out include things like:

* more intense exercise (CoSaWe04)
* dancing
* crying
* venting (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty, HappyVanillaBean, Anybody\_Minimum)
* writing can also be a discharge activity
* screaming into a pillow
* taking a car ride with the windows down (MSH0123)
* driving or walking somewhere nice (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty, HappyVanillaBean)
* hot shower or bath (MSH0123, smokyoat, HappyVanillaBean, CoSaWe04, Anybody\_Minimum)
* DIY/hammering things! (apragopolis)
* vent art / memes (guavatc, Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* listening to angsty music (guavatc)
* a hot cup of tea (guavatc)
* watching comforting or funny youtube videos (guavatc, CoSaWe04)
* stomping around (apragopolis)
* watching something sad and having a good cry (smokyoat)
* therapy (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* getting into bed, sleeping or napping (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty, HappyVanillaBean, Anybody\_Minimum)
* aggressive cleaning, vacuuming, scrubbing (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* grabbing a refreshing drink (HappyVAnillaBean)
* reading (CoSaWe04)
* heated blanket (CoSaWe04)
* weighted blanket and essential oils (Anybody\_Minimum)
* fidget toys (Future-Designer-6855)
* look at pictures of loved ones (Future-Designer-6855)
* leave the situation (Future-Designer-6855)
* check in with a support group (Future-Designer-6855)
* duvet day (Anybody\_Minimum)

**So the exercise is:** What does your Time In and Time Out look like? Are there any that you are you willing to try (I'll add yours to the lists above!), and are there opportunities for more investment in Time In?

[Unleashing American Energy – The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/)

https://preview.redd.it/r55d314bbcee1.png?width=1263&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2bc657ff78fc4a3256e2e0d3a9841c3b8f996a6

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: 

Section 1.  Background***.***  America is blessed with an abundance of energy and natural resources that have historically powered our Nation’s economic prosperity.  In recent years, burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations have impeded the development of these resources, limited the generation of reliable and affordable electricity, reduced job creation, and inflicted high energy costs upon our citizens.  These high energy costs devastate American consumers by driving up the cost of transportation, heating, utilities, farming, and manufacturing, while weakening our national security.

It is thus in the national interest to unleash America’s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources.  This will restore American prosperity —- including for those men and women who have been forgotten by our economy in recent years.  It will also rebuild our Nation’s economic and military security, which will deliver peace through strength.

Sec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States:

(a)  to encourage energy exploration and production on Federal lands and waters, including on the Outer Continental Shelf, in order to meet the needs of our citizens and solidify the United States as a global energy leader long into the future;

(b)  to establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states;

(c)  to protect the United States’s economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation;

(d)  to ensure that all regulatory requirements related to energy are grounded in clearly applicable law;

(e)  to eliminate the “electric vehicle (EV) mandate” and promote true consumer choice, which is essential for economic growth and innovation, by removing regulatory barriers to motor vehicle access; by ensuring a level regulatory playing field for consumer choice in vehicles; by terminating, where appropriate, state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles; and by considering the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase by individuals, private businesses, and government entities alike by rendering other types of vehicles unaffordable;           

(f)  to safeguard the American people’s freedom to choose from a variety of goods and appliances, including but not limited to lightbulbs, dishwashers, washing machines, gas stoves, water heaters, toilets, and shower heads, and to promote market competition and innovation within the manufacturing and appliance industries;

(g)  to ensure that the global effects of a rule, regulation, or action shall, whenever evaluated, be reported separately from its domestic costs and benefits, in order to promote sound regulatory decision making and prioritize the interests of the American people;

(h)  to guarantee that all executive departments and agencies (agencies) provide opportunity for public comment and rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific analysis; and

(i)  to ensure that no Federal funding be employed in a manner contrary to the principles outlined in this section, unless required by law.  

Sec. 3.  Immediate Review of All Agency Actions that Potentially Burden the Development of Domestic Energy Resources.  (a)  The heads of all agencies shall review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, settlements, consent orders, and any other agency actions (collectively, agency actions) to identify those agency actions that impose an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources — with particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources — or that are otherwise inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, including restrictions on consumer choice of vehicles and appliances.    

(b)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall, in consultation with the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Economic Council (NEC), develop and begin implementing action plans to suspend, revise, or rescind all agency actions identified as unduly burdensome under subsection (a) of this section, as expeditiously as possible and consistent with applicable law.  The head of any agency who determines that such agency does not have agency actions described in subsection (a) of this section shall submit to the Director of OMB a written statement to that effect and, absent a determination by the Director of OMB that such agency does have agency actions described in this subsection, shall have no further responsibilities under this section.

(c)  Agencies shall promptly notify the Attorney General of any steps taken pursuant to subsection (a) of this section so that the Attorney General may, as appropriate:

(i)   provide notice of this Executive Order and any such actions to any court with jurisdiction over pending litigation in which such actions may be relevant; and

(ii)  request that such court stay or otherwise delay further litigation, or seek other appropriate relief consistent with this order, pending the completion of the administrative actions described in this order.

(d)  Pursuant to the policy outlined in section 2 of this order, the Attorney General shall consider whether pending litigation against illegal, dangerous, or harmful policies should be resolved through stays or other relief.

Sec. 4.  Revocation of and Revisions to Certain Presidential and Regulatory Actions*.*  (a)  The following are revoked and any offices established therein are abolished:

(i)     Executive Order 13990 of January 20, 2021 (Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis);

(ii)    Executive Order 13992 of January 20, 2021 (Revocation of Certain Executive Orders Concerning Federal Regulation);

(iii)   Executive Order 14008 of January 27, 2021 (Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad);

(iv)    Executive Order 14007 of January 27, 2021 (President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology);

(v)     Executive Order 14013 of February 4, 2021 (Rebuilding and Enhancing Programs to Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration);

(vi)    Executive Order 14027 of May 7, 2021 (Establishment of the Climate Change Support Office);

(vii)   Executive Order 14030 of May 20, 2021 (Climate-Related Financial Risk);

(viii)  Executive Order 14037 of August 5, 2021 (Strengthening American Leadership in Clean Cars and Trucks);

(ix)    Executive Order 14057 of December 8, 2021 (Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability);

(x)     Executive Order 14072 of April 22, 2022 (Strengthening the Nation’s Forests, Communities, and Local Economies);

(xi)    Executive Order 14082 of September 12, 2022 (Implementation of the Energy and Infrastructure Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022); and

(xii)   Executive Order 14096 of April 21, 2023 (Revitalizing Our Nation’s Commitment to Environmental Justice for All).

(b)  All activities, programs, and operations associated with the American Climate Corps, including actions taken by any agency shall be terminated immediately.  Within one day of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall submit a letter to all parties to the “American Climate Corps Memorandum of Understanding” dated December 2023 to terminate the memorandum, and the head of each party to the memorandum shall agree to the termination in writing.  

(c)  Any assets, funds, or resources allocated to an entity or program abolished by subsection (a) of this section shall be redirected or disposed of in accordance with applicable law.  

(d)  The head of any agency that has taken action respecting offices and programs in subsection (a) shall take all necessary steps to ensure that all such actions are terminated or, if necessary, appropriate, or required by law, that such activities are transitioned to other agencies or entities.  

(e)  Any contract or agreement between the United States and any third party on behalf of the entities or programs abolished in subsection (a) of this section, or in furtherance of them, shall be terminated for convenience, or otherwise, as quickly as permissible under the law. 

Sec. 5.  Unleashing Energy Dominance through Efficient Permitting.  (a)  Executive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977 (Relating to protection and enhancement of environmental quality) is hereby revoked.

(b)  To expedite and simplify the permitting process, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) shall provide guidance on implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 *et seq.*, and propose rescinding CEQ’s NEPA regulations found at 40 CFR 1500 *et seq.*

(c)  Following the provision of the guidance, the Chairman of CEQ shall convene a working group to coordinate the revision of agency-level implementing regulations for consistency. The guidance in subsection (b) and any resulting implementing regulations must expedite permitting approvals and meet deadlines established in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Public Law 118-5).  Consistent with applicable law, all agencies must prioritize efficiency and certainty over any other objectives, including those of activist groups, that do not align with the policy goals set forth in section 2 of this order or that could otherwise add delays and ambiguity to the permitting process.

(d)  The Secretaries of Defense, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Homeland Security, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies shall undertake all available efforts to eliminate all delays within their respective permitting processes, including through, but not limited to, the use of general permitting and permit by rule.  For any project an agency head deems essential for the Nation’s economy or national security, agencies shall use all possible authorities, including emergency authorities, to expedite the adjudication of Federal permits.  Agencies shall work closely with project sponsors to realize the ultimate construction or development of permitted projects.

(e)  The Director of the NEC and the Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs shall jointly prepare recommendations to Congress, which shall:

(i)   facilitate the permitting and construction of interstate energy transportation and other critical energy infrastructure, including, but not limited to, pipelines, particularly in regions of the Nation that have lacked such development in recent years; and

(ii)  provide greater certainty in the Federal permitting process, including, but not limited to, streamlining the judicial review of the application of NEPA.

Sec. 6.  Prioritizing Accuracy in Environmental Analyses.  (a)  In all Federal permitting adjudications or regulatory processes, all agencies shall adhere to only the relevant legislated requirements for environmental considerations and any considerations beyond these requirements are eliminated.  In fulfilling all such requirements, agencies shall strictly use the most robust methodologies of assessment at their disposal and shall not use methodologies that are arbitrary or ideologically motivated.

(b) The Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (IWG), which was established pursuant to Executive Order 13990, is hereby disbanded, and any guidance, instruction, recommendation, or document issued by the IWG is withdrawn as no longer representative of governmental policy including: 

(i)    the Presidential Memorandum of January 27, 2021 (Restoring Trust in Government Through Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policymaking);  

(ii)   the Report of the Greenhouse Gas Monitoring and Measurement Interagency Working Group of November 2023 (National Strategy to Advance an Integrated U.S. Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Monitoring, and Information System); 

(iii)  the Technical Support Document of February 2021 (Social Cost of Carbon, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide Interim Estimates under Executive Order 13990); and

(iv)   estimates of the social cost of greenhouse gases, including the estimates for the social cost of carbon, the social cost of methane, or the social cost of nitrous oxide based, in whole or in part, on the IWG’s work or guidance.

(c)  The calculation of the “social cost of carbon” is marked by logical deficiencies, a poor basis in empirical science, politicization, and the absence of a foundation in legislation.  Its abuse arbitrarily slows regulatory decisions and, by rendering the United States economy internationally uncompetitive, encourages a greater human impact on the environment by affording less efficient foreign energy producers a greater share of the global energy and natural resource market.  Consequently, within 60 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA shall issue guidance to address these harmful and detrimental inadequacies, including consideration of eliminating the “social cost of carbon” calculation from any Federal permitting or regulatory decision.

(d)  Prior to the guidance issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, agencies shall ensure estimates to assess the value of changes in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from agency actions, including with respect to the consideration of domestic versus international effects and evaluating appropriate discount rates, are, to the extent permitted by law, consistent with the guidance contained in OMB Circular A-4 of September 17, 2003 (Regulatory Analysis).

(e)  Furthermore, the head of each agency shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, initiate a process to make such changes to any rule, regulation, policy or action as may be necessary to ensure consistency with the Regulatory Analysis.

(f)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA, in collaboration with the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit joint recommendations to the Director of OMB on the legality and continuing applicability of the Administrator’s findings, “Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act,” Final Rule, 74 FR 66496 (December 15, 2009).

Sec. 7.  Terminating the Green New Deal.  (a)  All agencies shall immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58), including but not limited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program, and shall review their processes, policies, and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts, or any other financial disbursements of such appropriated funds for consistency with the law and the policy outlined in section 2 of this order.  Within 90 days of the date of this order, all agency heads shall submit a report to the Director of the NEC and Director of OMB that details the findings of this review, including recommendations to enhance their alignment with the policy set forth in section 2.  No funds identified in this subsection (a) shall be disbursed by a given agency until the Director of OMB and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy have determined that such disbursements are consistent with any review recommendations they have chosen to adopt.

(b)  When procuring goods and services, making decisions about leases, and making other arrangements that result in disbursements of Federal funds, agencies shall prioritize cost-effectiveness, American workers and businesses, and the sensible use of taxpayer money, to the greatest extent.  The Director of OMB shall finalize and circulate guidelines to further implement this subsection.

(c)  All agencies shall assess whether enforcement discretion of authorities and regulations can be utilized to advance the policy outlined in section 2 of this order.  Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall submit a report to the Director of OMB identifying any such instances.

Sec. 8.  Protecting America’s National Security.(a) The Secretary of Energy is directed restart reviews of applications for approvals of liquified natural gas export projects as expeditiously as possible, consistent with applicable law.  In assessing the “Public Interest” to be advanced by any particular application, the Secretary of Energy shall consider the economic and employment impacts to the United States and the impact to the security of allies and partners that would result from granting the application.

(b)  With respect to any proposed deepwater port for the export of liquefied natural gas (project) for which a favorable record of decision (ROD) has previously been issued pursuant to the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (DWPA), 33 U.S.C. 1501 *et seq.*, the Administrator of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) shall, within 30 days of the date of this order and consistent with applicable law, determine whether any refinements to the project proposed subsequent to the ROD are likely to result in adverse environmental consequences that substantially differ from those associated with the originally-evaluated project so as to present a seriously different picture of the foreseeable adverse environmental consequences (seriously different consequences).  In making this determination, MARAD shall qualitatively assess any difference in adverse environmental consequences between the project with and without the proposed refinements, including any potential consequences not addressed in the final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which shall be considered adequate under NEPA notwithstanding any revisions to NEPA that may have been enacted following the final EIS.  MARAD shall submit this determination, together with a detailed justification, to the Secretary of Transportation and to the President.

(c)  Pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, if MARAD determines that such refinements are not likely to result in seriously different consequences, it shall include in that determination a description of the refinements to supplement and update the ROD, if necessary and then no later than 30 additional days, he shall issue a DWPA license.

(d)  If MARAD determines, with concurrence from the Secretary of Transportation, that such proposed refinements are likely to result in seriously different consequences, it shall, within 60 days after submitting such determination, issue an Environmental Assessment (EA) examining such consequences and, with respect to all other environmental consequences not changed due to project refinements, shall reaffirm the conclusions of the final EIS.  Within 30 days after issuing the EA, MARAD shall issue an addendum to the ROD, if necessary, and shall, within 30 additional days, issue a DWPA license consistent with the ROD.

Sec. 9.  Restoring America’s Mineral Dominance*.*  (a)  The Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, Administrator of the EPA, Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, as appropriate, shall identify all agency actions that impose undue burdens on the domestic mining and processing of non-fuel minerals and undertake steps to revise or rescind such actions.

(b)  The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture shall reassess any public lands withdrawals for potential revision.

(c)  The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey’s list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.

(d)  The Secretary of the Interior shall prioritize efforts to accelerate the ongoing, detailed geologic mapping of the United States, with a focus on locating previously unknown deposits of critical minerals.

(e)  The Secretary of Energy shall ensure that critical mineral projects, including the processing of critical minerals, receive consideration for Federal support, contingent on the availability of appropriated funds.

(f)  The United States Trade Representative shall assess whether exploitative practices and state-assisted mineral projects abroad are unlawful or unduly burden or restrict United States commerce.

(g)  The Secretary of Commerce shall assess the national security implications of the Nation’s mineral reliance and the potential for trade action.

(h)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall assess the quantity and inflow of minerals that are likely the product of forced labor into the United States and whether such inflows pose a threat to national security and, within 90 days of the date of this order, shall provide this assessment to the Director of the NEC.

(i)  The Secretary of Defense shall consider the needs of the United States in supplying and maintaining the National Defense Stockpile, review the legal authorities and obligations in managing the National Defense Stockpile, and take all appropriate steps to ensure that the National Defense Stockpile will provide a robust supply of critical minerals in event of future shortfall.

(j)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.

(k)  The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.

Sec. 10.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

[Trump Includes Critical Minerals in His Energy Bonanza - Heatmap News](https://heatmap.news/politics/critical-minerals-trump-executive-order)

[Heatmap Illustration\/Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/aw283t16ccee1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd83f3067c43fc1e37b6a61b32ec7c0c697e9237)

t’s not just drill, baby, drill (for oil) — it’s mine, baby, mine. Along with the shots at [wind energy](https://heatmap.news/sparks/wind-executive-order-trump) and the previous administration’s climate policy, President Donald Trump’s blizzard of energy and environmental policy announcements and executive orders on Monday included a boost to the domestic mining and refining of critical minerals.

The directives outlined a strategy that would promote both the extraction and, crucially, the processing of critical minerals in America and would look skeptically at importing them — especially from China.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio focused on Chinese mineral dominance as a national security threat in his confirmation hearing earlier this month,[telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that China has](https://x.com/ErnestScheyder/status/1879580327456526419) “come to dominate the critical mineral supplies throughout the world … Even those who want to see more electric cars, no matter where you make them, those batteries are almost entirely dependent on the ability of the Chinese and the willingness of the Chinese Communist Party to produce it and export it to you.”

The German Marshall Fund[has estimated](https://www.gmfus.org/news/chinas-role-critical-mineral-supply-chains) that China makes up 60% of the supply of critical minerals and 85% of the processing capacity. The United States Geological Survey’s list of 50 critical minerals includes commonly used metals like aluminum, as well as a number of metals and minerals crucial for batteries and green energy technology like cobalt, lithium, graphite, and manganese.

While new reserves of lithium are constantly being discovered, China dominates refining of the metal, with 60% market share for refining battery-grade lithium,[according to S&P.](https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/metals/092324-factbox-chinas-lithium-industry-eyes-output-cuts-to-shore-up-market-sentiment#:~:text=Globally%2C%20China%20ranks%20ninth%20in,bearing%20on%20the%20global%20market.) And the Trump administration’s interest in critical minerals may not be limited to the (current) boundaries of the United States; it is also one reason why the president is so interested in Greenland, which likely has [massive stores of rare earth metals](https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-greenland-minerals-rare-earth), including uranium.

In the executive order “Unleashing American Energy,” President Trump called for agency heads and relevant Cabinet officials to “identify all agency actions that impose undue burdens on the domestic mining and processing of non-fuel minerals and undertake steps to revise or rescind such actions,” along with specifically directing the secretary of Energy and the secretary of the Interior to make “efforts to accelerate the ongoing, detailed geologic mapping of the United States,” and “ensure that critical mineral projects, including the processing of critical minerals, receive consideration for Federal support,” respectively.

He also directed Cabinet officials not directly involved with energy and resources policy to lend their weight to the American critical mineral effort.The United States trade representative and secretary of Commerce were tasked with looking at overseas critical mineral projects to see if they’re “unlawful or unduly burden or restrict United States commerce” and to examine “the national security implications of the Nation’s mineral reliance and the potential for trade action,” indicating that Trump administration[may likely continue a version of the Biden administration’s tariffs and restrictions on imports of Chinese critical minerals](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/Section%20301%20Modifications%20Determination%20FRN%20(Sept%2012%202024)%20(FINAL).pdf).

Critical minerals also showed up in [executive orders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/) where President Trump [declared a “national energy emergency”](https://heatmap.news/politics/national-energy-emergency) and an order specific to resource exploitation in Alaska. In the emergency declaration, minerals were included alongside energy as areas whose “identification, leasing, development, production, transportation, refining, and generation capacity of the United States are all far too inadequate to meet our Nation’s needs.” In the Alaska order, “Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential,” minerals were listed alongside “energy, timber, and seafood,” as the “abundant and largely untapped supply of natural resources” that the state possesses, even as the order was largely specific to oil and gas projects like liquefied natural gas and oil drilling.

The Trump administration’s interest in critical minerals is not unique. The Biden Administration also pursued a domestic critical minerals policy, including[approving](https://www.blm.gov/press-release/major-lithium-mine-approved-nevada-latest-effort-support-domestic-supply-critical) and lending money to[lithium mining operations.](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/doe-announces-996-million-loan-guarantee-ioneer-rhyolite-ridge-advance-domestic)

**Date:** Wednesday, December 11, 2024 at 8:11 AM  
**To:** Jim Sims <[Jim.Sims@niocorp.com](mailto:Jim.Sims@niocorp.com)\>  
**Subject:** Five Questions as we head into 2025!

Good Afternoon, Jim!

   As we wait with many....  I've gotta ask a few more questions leading up to a years end 2024 **REDDIT REVIEW** & the AGM! Rumor has it team Niocorp is in talks with the new administration as 2025 approaches. 

Jim - As 2024 nears an end- Trade Tariffs, China, Critical Minerals & a new administration are on deck. The table is set for Critical Minerals to take center stage.

1. *\*\*\*Are several entities such as (DoD, U.S. & Allied Governments & Private Industries) “STILL” Interested securing Off-take Agreements for Niocorp's remaining Critical Minerals (Titanium, Niobium 25%, Rare Earths, CaCO3, MgCO3 & some Iron stuff* ***as 2025 approaches?****) - Should Financing be secured??*

 RESPONSE:

***""Several USG agencies are working with us to potentially provide financing to the Elk Creek Project.  And, yes, we are in discussions with the National Defense Stockpile, which (like much of the USG) is much more intensely interested in seeing U.S. production of scandium catalyze a variety of defense and commercial technologies.""***

QUESTION #2) Niocorp has completed positive bench scale testing of magnetic rare earths from magnetic scrap. Is Niocorp now pursuing ""Pilot Plant studies at the site in Canada"" on the recycling of aforementioned materials? Could you offer comment on how that might continue.

 RESPONSE:

***""We have concluded all testing necessary at this time at our demonstration plant in Quebec to show the potential of our proposed system’s ability to recycle NdFeB magnets.""***

https://preview.redd.it/9g6l99gxdcee1.png?width=403&format=png&auto=webp&s=2188d8a727851b99f31d096139e3a61590c528de

Also, the material news release above mentions the ""Fact"" Niocorp could utilize the new proprietary Separation methods now being undertaken for the separation of **(\*\*Other Feedstock Sources).**

 RESPONSE:

***""Yes.""***

QUESTION #3) Could Coal waste, or other mine feedstock sources be utilized. Please offer additional comment if you can do so on what ""Other Feedstock Sources"" might be in play? Or under Consideration from the team at Niocorp...

 RESPONSE:

***""Post-combustion ash from coal fired power plants is highly unlikely to ever become a commercially viable source of REEs.  There are a variety of other potential sources of REE mixed concentrate that we could possibly process.""***

 QUESTION #4) Is the New Trump Administration seeking to continue to build upon its commitment to mining the production & sourcing of domestic critical minerals? Comment if possible... 

 RESPONSE:

***""Very much so.""***

https://preview.redd.it/o7j5dilzdcee1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=c98a451c04477b17b650440203eeb1f190d3252a

[NioCorp Completes Successful Initial Testing of Rare Earth Permanent Magnet Recycling | NioCorp Developments Ltd.](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-completes-successful-initial-testing-of-rare-earth-permanent-magnet-recycling/)\*\*Also, the material news release above mentions *“As no economic analysis has been completed on the rare earth mineral resource comprising the Elk Creek Project, further testing and studies are required before determining whether extraction of REEs can be reasonably justified and economically viable after taking account of all relevant factors.”*

**Gotta ask.... �**�

*5) Where does Niocorp stand on achieving the funds to complete/update the* ***""early as possible 2024 F.S.""****?     Does Niocorp foresee this completion date now being pushed into 2025 given some further testing is now needing to be completed? Please comment if possible...*

 RESPONSE:

***""We are working on several potential sources of funding to complete the work necessary to update our Feasibility Study.""***

1i6ht2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1i6ht2m/has_anyone_needed_a_medication_adjustment_after/,Has anyone needed a medication adjustment after significantly decreasing caffeine?,"Hi Friends!

I've been on Vyvanse 40mg for around 2 years. I had previously been on sertraline (zoloft) for about 5 years, before I weaned off last summer. Weaning off zoloft was not a great experience and my depression/anxiety came back and I eventually went on fluoxetine (prozac). I am now on 40mg fluoxetine with the 40mg of Vyvanse (not generic). Prozac has been life changing. I am literally, more me, and it is wonderful. I don't even get migraines anymore, when had stopped for the most part when on zoloft ( I think I had 3 during that whole time), but returned with each menstrual cycle when I weaned off zoloft.

Since I have increased to 40mg of Prozac, and I am assuming in December I probably hit ""therapeutic levels"", because December was just magical. The only problem, is that almost every morning I would be almost like manic, yip yapping away, sending lots of texts, and just generally frenetic. 

As usual, it usually takes me a while to connect the dots and to be honest, it was a little fun. But after a while, it is just exhausting. I finally realized, or maybe, came to terms with, that maybe having 2-3 cups of coffee, vyvanse, and fluoxetine was not a great combination. I decided to drastically cut my caffeine intake to see what would happen. Well, low and behold I feel much better just having 1 half caff coffee and the rest decaf, with the occasional afternoon half caff cup.

I started this on Jan 7th (I think), and I did not progressively wean down for caffeine, even through i have been drinking coffee at varying rates of consumptions since I was 14 ( I am 37 now). I did not even consider withdrawals and the caffeine withdrawals have been a bitch, but I have noticed that I feel like my medication is not as effective anymore. I feel more distracted and I am having break through symptoms of jealousy with my husband (definite sign of my depression). I am going to schedule an appointment with my psych NP, but I was wondering if anyone has benefitted from increasing medications to maybe compensate for the lack of caffeine? I have also noticed that my marijuana use has increased as well, which I am assuming is like dopamine seeking behavior.

Thanks for reading all of this!

TL;DR: Drastically cut caffeine and I feel like my ADHD is worse. I think I may need an increase, looking to see if anyone else has had that experience. ",1,1737463635.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I understand not wanting to text a ton, I get pen paled and then let those conversations die. I've also been asked out very quickly, perhaps not that quickly, though. I sent a hello to this guy see if we could have more of an exchange, but they immediately asked again, and in a way lacking tact.

My assumption is that they often if not always lead with this immediate invitation, which would be flattering if the second exchange wasn't so to the point and rather pushy, e.g. ""So are you free?"" I've dealt with a lot of guys being really pushy in various ways, and as soon as it starts, I basically ghost.

Ciao a tutti!  Planning a trip to Italy?  Get ready for some delicious food! But before you dig in, let's talk about Italian dining etiquette.  Knowing the basics will not only make your dining experience more enjoyable, but also show respect for Italian culture.  Don't worry, it's not as complicated as you might think!

**The Pace of the Meal:**

Forget the rushed American-style dining.  In Italy, meals are a social event, meant to be savored and enjoyed slowly.  Don't expect to be in and out in 30 minutes.  Embrace the leisurely pace – it's all part of the experience!  Taking your time is appreciated.

**Ordering:**

* **Sharing is Caring (Sometimes):** While sharing appetizers or side dishes is common, ordering a whole pizza or pasta dish for yourself is perfectly acceptable, particularly during a casual meal. Don't feel pressured to share.
* **Antipasto, Primo, Secondo, Contorno, Dolce:**  This is the traditional order: appetizers, first course (pasta or soup), second course (meat or fish), side dish, and dessert.  You don't *have* to order everything; picking one or two courses is fine, especially during lunch.
* **Bread:**  Bread is typically served alongside your meal.  It's perfectly acceptable to use it to sop up any delicious sauce left on your plate!

**Table Manners:**

* **Cutlery:**  Start with the outermost utensils and work your way in.
* **Hands:**  Keep your hands visible above the table.
* **Saying ""Grazie"":**  Always say ""Grazie"" (thank you) to your server. A simple ""Prego"" (you're welcome) if you are serving yourself.
* **Napkins:**  Place your napkin on your lap.
* **Tipping:**  Tipping isn't mandatory in Italy, as service charges are usually included.  However, rounding up the bill or leaving a small tip (5-10%) for excellent service is appreciated.
* **Noisy Eating:**  While slurping noodles is common in some cultures, it's generally considered less polite in Italy. Eat with a sense of grace and ease.
* **Using Your Hands:** Pizza and other informal street food are acceptable to eat with your hands.
* **Coffee:**  Enjoy your coffee after your meal, traditionally as an espresso.


**At the Trattoria:**

Trattorias are informal, family-run restaurants.  Feel free to be relaxed and enjoy the authentic atmosphere.  Don't be surprised if the owner joins your table for a chat!

**At the Ristorante:**

Ristorantes tend to be a bit more formal, with a more extensive menu and possibly higher prices. Dress neatly and enjoy the refined ambiance.

**Common Phrases:**

* **Il conto, per favore:** The check, please.
* **Grazie:** Thank you.
* **Prego:** You're welcome.
* **Buon appetito!:** Enjoy your meal! (Say this *before* you start eating, not during or after).


**Most Importantly:** Relax and enjoy the experience! Italians value good company and good food above all else.  Don't stress about minor slip-ups; everyone makes mistakes.  Focus on having a wonderful time, savoring the delicious food, and immersing yourself in the Italian culture.  Buon viaggio!

So I told my sister that from now on, each cuddle session costs ten dollars for five minutes. She laughed, assuming I was joking, but I was dead serious. I even set up a little sign that says ""Holding Fee"" on the coffee table. She refused to pay the first time, so I took the baby out of her arms immediately. Now she barely visits, and my parents are furious, saying I am making motherhood look transactional.

 That was until 14 yo, she wanted different friendship and wasn't interested in a type like myself, she actually pretended to go out with my group to then go away to see other people , basically using us to have the permission from her parents to then go with less than raccomandable friends . 

Now forward to the 20 days ago , I discovered that she got back from the military and she is now back in our home town. I make a funny comment on her IG story and we quickly get along like good friends, we hang out with her friends and I am going through bad things , she has also a lot on her plate right now. 

I open up first about my stuff , she says she doesn't like talking about her problems , but then openly she does and i see like we are matching. 

Then the problem, I presented myself under her house on a saturday to say Hi and then leave, I wrote her on whatzapp that i was there. She says that is creepy over the phone. Like she is really pissed off.

  
I feel like a total shit, I thought since we saw each other and were talking over the phone all days i could do that. She didn't like that at all , I explained her that i just wanted to see her for a coffee and see her parents before we would go out. 

She then explained to me that this reminded her of her toxic ex-boyfriend who used to follow her everywhere with his car. 

I had no idea that my gesture would look like that , i explained how sorry i was. 

Did i do a really bad thing? 

Now we are going to the gym together, she says she is fine with me going, but am i invading her space? 

I am actually really captured by her, not only by her looks , like the more i know her the more i feel like i should go for it. 

Maybe i am going to fast? Do i look pushy? I never truly declared myself to a girl i actually love, i have never suffered this much for a girl in my life, i felt like stone till now.

1i6hii0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i6hii0,Pahadee latte blend review,"Tried something other than BT for the first time. Picked 80:20 arabica robusta from Pahadee coffee. 

250gm is for 410rs, so it's cheaper than competition but they add shipping so door to door it costed about rs. 460.

Grinded at 45 clicks on K6 but the coffee was slightly underextracted. Will need to go coarser. 16gms in 33gms out in 35 seconds. Had it with 200ml milk.

The coffee had a strong bitterness in every sip, but it was so strong that it masked any other tasting notes. Very little hints of chocolate, if any. It probably is due to 20% robusta, but don't think I'll go this route again.

Overall it's ok for a bold cup of coffee, but tasting notes being absent is not a lot of fun. ",2,1737462639.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

Phone number:  902-420-9287

Boiling Water
To boil water
• Fill a pot with water. 
• Heat the water until bubbles come from the bottom of the pot. 
• Once the water reaches a rolling boil, let it boil for 1 minute. 
• Turn off the heat source and let the water cool. 
• Pour the water into a clean container with a cover for storage.

Remember that containers may need to be sanitized before using them to store safe water: 
• Use bleach that does not have an added scent (like lemon). 
• Add 1 teaspoon (64 drops or 5 milliliters) of household liquid bleach to 1 quart (1.14 litres or 4 cups) of water. 
• Pour this into a clean storage container and shake well, making sure that the solution coats the entire inside 
of the container. 
• Let sit at least 30 seconds, and then pour out solution. 
• Let air dry OR rinse with clean water that has already been made safe, if available.
• Never mix bleach with ammonia or other cleaners. Open windows and doors to get fresh air when you use 
bleach.

Water Filters
Boil tap water even if it is filtered. Water filters do not remove bacteria or viruses.

Household Water Usage

Preparing and cooking food
• Use boiled water to wash all fruits and vegetables.
• Bring water to a rolling boil for 1 minute before adding food. 
• Use boiled water when preparing drinks, such as coffee, tea, and lemonade

Feeding infants and using formula
• Continue to breastfeed. If breastfeeding is not an option use ready-to-use formula, if possible.
• Prepare powdered or concentrated formula with bottled water. Use boiled water if you do not have bottled 
water. 
• Wash and sterilize bottles and nipples before use. 
• If you cannot sterilize bottles, try to use single-serve, ready-to-feed bottles.
Ice
• Do not use ice from ice trays, ice dispensers, or ice makers.
• Throw out all ice made with tap water.
• Make new ice with boiled or bottled water. 

Bathing and showering
• Be careful not to swallow any water when bathing or showering. 
• Use caution when bathing infants and young children. Consider giving them a sponge bath to reduce the 
chance of them swallowing water.

Brushing teeth
Brush teeth with boiled or bottled water.

Washing dishes
Dishwashers are safe to use if the water reaches a temperature of at least 160 degrees or if the dishwasher has a 
sanitizing cycle.
To wash dishes by hand: 
• Wash and rinse the dishes as you normally would using hot water. 
• In a separate basin, add 1 teaspoon of unscented household bleach for each gallon of warm water. 
• Soak the rinsed dishes in the water for at least one minute. 
• Let the dishes air dry completely.

Laundry
It is safe to do laundry using regular methods.

Pets
Pets can get some of the same diseases as people. It is a good idea to give them boiled water.

1i6hhx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1i6hhx3/sour_coffee_please_help/,Sour Coffee. Please HELP!!!!!,"Hey there, I recently got an Aeropress—my first brewer ever. It allowed me to make some of the finest and most satisfying cups I've had at home. I'm new to coffee brewing, and AP got me hooked with its versatility and ease of use. However, I couldn't replicate the same cup of coffee. It was due to my cheap hand grinder giving out uneven grinds. I upgraded to a Timemore C2—an instant game changer. 

For the last 4 days, I've been brewing sour cups with an oily layer at the top consistently without a break. I've tried to fine-tune my recipe and adjusted it as per the most common and famous recipes. This whole process is stressing me out and being unable to brew a simple cup is causing me to lose some sleep over it. 

Here's the recipe:

* 1:12 (I love a strong, concentrated cup), 1:14 (for a smoother cup)
* Inverted.
* 12g of coffee, 144ml water; 14g of coffee, 196ml water
* 92-96 C  water (I don't have any tools. I simply let the water rest up to 45 seconds from the boiling point. Always worked before.)
* Pour, stir gently 3-4 times, steep for 2.5 mins, Press for 20-30 seconds.
* Medium-fine grind, 15 clicks on the C2. Tried 14 as well as 16. (I changed the timings to 2 minutes 15 seconds for 15 clicks, and 2 minutes 30 seconds for 14 clicks.)
* I've tried to adjust the timings to 1 minute 30 seconds with medium fine and medium-slightly-coarser-than-table-salt with 20 seconds extra at the end. 

Every attempt is consistently giving me a sour cup with an oily layer at the top. I've no idea what I am doing wrong. Pls help me figure this out. 

Btw, the beans are not specialty beans. It was my first time buying beans and I went with A/AA medium roast beans. The sizes of the beans are a little uneven with uneven shades of brown as well. It might be THE variable that's disrupting everything but I cannot tell since it was fine till 4 days ago and I haven't used specialty coffee beans (ordered it tho, its coming this week.)

I used to watch every game I could but now I rarely watch any game more than about 20 minutes.  I don’t know why.  Probably my kids.

No school yesterday or today.  Yesterday because MLK and today I guess cause it’s cold?  It isn’t slick out.  Not sure.  Anyway, they’re home another day.  I’m hoping to clean a little and maybe play a little.  Not sure.  We definitely could clean but that never ends.  

I know we need to do a craft.  I think we need to get the rock tumbler out and play with it.  That may be a good one to do today.  

Hamburger steak, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob and gravy for supper.  No idea what else.  

My kids and I have been fighting.  Mostly it’s them ignoring anything I say and me losing my temper.  We’re going to start fresh today and I am not going to lose my temper.  Here’s the thing.  I’m not happy.  My mood is neutral to grump all the time now.  I didn’t used to be as easily angered as I am now, but it seems to come from nowhere.  I need to get a grip on it.  Today is the day.  Instead of letting my anger take hold, I take a breath and control my anger.  Hopefully my kids give me a little help here.  Hehe.  I need all the help I can get cause I really don’t like being unable to enjoy things.  I have little flashes of enjoying things then the sadness creeps back in.  It’s hard to maintain positive thoughts and feelings.  I need to get that gratitude journal out and write.  

I’m going to go write about my blessings right now.  Well, as soon as I make coffee.

Everyone can write here, but let’s try to keep it positive.  We have plenty of negative in our lives.

1i6hdgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1i6hdgm/camping/,Camping,"(Disclaimer: this is probably gonna be bad, ngl, but atleast pretend to like it :sob:)

After realising that I hated the city life, I wanted to test out how I’d fair out in the woods. I packed a tent, campfire materials, food and water to last me a few days (six plastic water bottles and four MREs I had bought) and some other survival bits and bobs. To make it even more interesting, I decided to go into a supposedly haunting area of the forest too, filled with sightings of cryptids and fairly childish ghost stories about it, nothing to special.

I drove down here and found a spot that was good, and apparently very windless, calm and very clear, as well as being quite dry and lacking of animals. After setting up camp, I set out, hunting for deer, passing a tree with a scratch mark on it, before finally spotting a deer.

Taking the shot, I put the nearly full magazine in my pocket and holster the rifle. Wandering over to the deer, I take its meat and head back to camp, passing the tree with the two scratch marks and arriving at camp.

 It’s getting late, so I put up the fire and put the meat over it to save my rations, penetrated by a stick. I put a coffee cup on the table to save my drinking water and place the bottles and MREs on the outside of my tent

It's nearing midnight now, so I put out the fire, making sure to leave a few logs for tomorrow, place the half-full cup of coffee back onto the table, tuck myself into the tent, spotting a rip on the side of the tent I hadn’t before, no matter, I’ll fix it tomorrow.

# Tomorrow:

I wake up, reaching for the tent, noticing the two rips on the side of the tent again. Ignoring the future work, I get up and notice the spilt coffee on the floor, likely the wind’s doing…

 I wander over to the rations, stacked neatly in a leather satchel, two MREs and three bottles of water, and the empty magazine from last night, probably should have brought more than one… After re-gathering my bearings, I go to the campfire, still hot with ember and its logs being burnt to a crisp. I needed to find more logs, so I went past the tree, it’s three scratch marks still penetrating the bark. After finding enough logs, I take them home and sit at the table. There is something chewing at me from the inside, I feel like I’m missing something, but then I slowly start to realise… I don’t think I’m alone…",1,1737462121.0,Horror_stories,0,1.0,False
