( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

The big providers are panicking, and it’s entirely because of services like **IPTVGREAT**. After testing it for a month, I realized this isn't just a streaming service; it’s the **Best IPTV 2026** ""life hack"" for anyone tired of being ripped off.

**The ""Cable Trap""**  
We’ve all been there. You sign up for a ""deal,"" and a year later, the price doubles. You want to watch football? That’s an extra package. You want movies? That’s another subscription.

**The Loophole: IPTVGREAT**  
I stumbled upon **IPTVGREAT** in a tech forum where users were discussing how to bypass region locks and expensive bundles.  
This service essentially unlocks everything. And when I say everything, I mean it:

* **The Sports ""Hack"":** Usually, you need three different apps to watch the NFL, NBA, and Premier League. **IPTVGREAT** puts them all in one menu. No blackouts. No ""premium tier"" required.
* **The Cinema ""Hack"":** Why pay $20 to rent a movie that just came out? The VOD (Video On Demand) library on IPTVGREAT is updated faster than any service I’ve ever seen.

**Why They Hate It**  
Cable companies hate **IPTVGREAT** because it exposes their pricing model for what it is: a scam.  
When you see that you can get 15,000+ channels in 4K quality for the price of two coffees, you realize how much the big giants have been overcharging you.

**Is it Reliable?**  
I expected a ""hack"" to be glitchy. I was wrong. The connection is rock solid. It uses advanced servers that seem to bypass the throttling ISPs usually do to streaming traffic.

**The Bottom Line**  
If you want to play by the rules of the big corporations, keep paying your $150 bill. But if you want the **Best IPTV 2026** experience—unlocked, unlimited, and affordable—it’s time to switch to **IPTVGREAT**.

Don’t let them gatekeep your entertainment anymore.

Well built, that thing. It would outlast his time at the company. 

He waved off his driver with a nod. Young lad in his twenties. Polite, respectful. The boy could go far if he had a bit more ambition.

That was the problem with the youth in Japan nowadays. Grown soft on idols and manga and maid cafes. 



The tarmac was hot. The low rumble of an airbus taking off vibrated through his feet. 

Boeing, Lockheed. 

American.

That’s all this airport flew nowadays.

A shame.

He walked towards the hangar a few feet away where his associate would be waiting.

As he opened the door, a cool gust of air hit him.

*Refreshing.*

It did a little to assuage the aches and pains that were adding up to his body.

A man in his late forties, slightly older than himself perhaps, dressed in a fine suit. He recognised the make. A traditional clothier, well respected in elite circles, he could tell by the quality of the stitch. 

It could only have been done by hand.

That’s what made this nation great.

Effort.

Perseverance.

Dedication. 

For four decades he lived and for four decades he saw those values erode away. Death by a thousand cuts. With more foreigners coming in, with focus shifting on trivial issues, the next generation would forget what made this country an overwhelming force, worthy of respect.

“Good morning, Akira-san. It is good to see you.”

“Likewise, Sato-san. How are the kids?”

Sato beamed.

“Good, good. My boy is looking at Tokyo University this year. Based on his scores, I am confident he will get in.”

“That’s great to hear. My cousin is on the board, you know. If there’s any help you need–”

Sato waved him off. “No, no, I want him to do this himself. He understands that. It builds character.”

“Of course, of course. And your daughter?”

“Ah, she is still young. Passionate about the piano. I don't mind as long as her grades keep up.”

“In our days the pressure was not so high, Sato-san. They need to live a little.”

Sato eyed the massive silhouette under thick canvas covers on the side of the hangar. His expression hardened.

“In our days the pressure was whether we would have enough food on the table. Whether everyone in the family would make it through the cold nights to see the next spring.”

“A different kind of pressure,” Akira smiled sadly. “It forged us into what we are.”

The familiarity of two self-made men settled comfortably in the knowledge of what did not need to be said.

“Well then, shall we get down to business?” he asked.

“Indeed. The tariffs have been murder on our profits. Nagoya is waiting for this to blow over. ‘Diamonds are formed under pressure’, the chairman told me.” Akira shook his head. “ but they squeeze us because they think we cannot fight back. Plain and simple.”

Sato sighed.

“Weakness.”

It was a chain that they let themselves be bound by. Decade after decade, generation after generation. Japan channelled its engineering genius into cars and electronics while its aviation ambitions were effectively capped by the Americans. But it was not enough. 

“There was a point where a man with a pair of wings and the rising sun painted on his back could silence the entire Pacific.”

Akira studied him carefully for a moment. “They burned that fight out of us, Sato-san.” A glance at the silhouette before looking away.

Sato stared right back. Piercing.

“Did they?”

The other man shifted uncomfortably in his seat. Coffee had been bought in for them. Both cups lay there, cold, untouched.

“That’s why the company requested secrecy for this?” Akira finally asked.

“No. The government.” he replied. “They finally see what men like us always did, Akira.”

Sato stood, Akira following. A hand went to the first of the three rhombus-shaped buttons on his blazer.

“Foreign hands, slowly clamping round our throats. Births, declining. Our technology stagnating. Where do you see us in a hundred years if we follow this path?”

Akira clasped his hands together, to stop fiddling. “Dead, or worse. Sato-san. I see it clear as you do. But our families, their future–”

“Is not in our hands.” Sato's words made him shiver. “It has not been in a long time.”

“The Chinese tighten the noose around our seas.""

""Yes,"" Akira nodded.

""You heard about the fishing ships.""

""Two sunk last week."" 

""Our so-called allies sit and watch, and we are not allowed to even defend ourselves.”

Akira said nothing. There was much he wanted to say.

""Our fathers did not die so that their grandchildren could apologise for existing.""

Sato walked to the silhouette. He did not look back.

“So what do you propose, Sato-san? Empire? To march on the world once more? Bring it to heel?

So that our children, our children's children may see the scars those bombs leave again?”

“Yes,” Sato replied softly. He looked at the roof of the hangar. The rust on the beams. Age and decay. That's what it felt like. What happens to purpose when no future is visible.

“But this time they have to learn that the knife cuts both ways. Or else they will never let us be.”

The older man stared at Sato’s back. Burdened, came to mind.  

""Akira-san. You asked about our families' futures.""

His hand found the canvas.

""This is their future.""

The cover fell.

Neither man spoke for a long time. The prototype did not need them to.

They simply stared at the rising sun painted on the side, resplendent in red and white.

Sato finally turned.

""Let the world know.” His voice was barely a whisper, but Akira felt each word land like an anvil strike in his ears. 

“Mitsubishi makes planes again.""

1r72hti,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menscomeback/comments/1r72hti/phone_addiction_is_killing_your_attention_span/,Phone addiction is killing your attention span: here’s how to get your brain back,"You’re not lazy. Your brain is just under siege. Most people scroll for 4+ hours a day and call it “rest.” But what’s really happening is constant micro-distraction. You check your phone during a 30-second wait in line, during meals, even while watching Netflix. When you don’t check it, your body feels restless. Like you’re missing something. That’s withdrawal. Not boredom.

This post breaks down what’s happening to your brain and what actually works to fix it, based on the best research from psychology, neuroscience, and productivity experts.

**1. Your phone is designed to hijack dopamine**  
Apps like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube are built on variable reward systems, same as slot machines. Sometimes you see a like, sometimes a message, sometimes nothing, this randomness keeps you hooked. Dr. Anna Lembke, author of *Dopamine Nation*, explains how overuse of these instant-reward systems leads to a “dopamine deficit state” where everyday life feels dull by comparison. You’re not depressed. You’re desensitized.

**2. Short bursts of scrolling kill your brain’s ability to focus**  
A 2021 Harvard study found that frequent task-switching between apps trains your brain to seek novelty at the cost of sustained attention. The result? You sit down to do deep work and feel itchy within 3 minutes. Your mind is trained to expect a reward, fast. This is also why books feel “boring” now. Your brain forgot how to slow down.

**3. The fear of “missing out” rewires your self-worth**  
The Center for Humane Technology revealed that “time spent on social media platforms is inversely related to life satisfaction, especially in young adults.” Every scroll reinforces a subconscious comparison loop. You start to feel behind, even if your life is fine. The emptiness is manufactured. And still, we scroll.

**4. Reclaiming focus starts with boredom**  
Cal Newport, author of *Digital Minimalism*, says you need to let your brain feel bored again. That’s how it resets. Try this: set a 24-hour no-scroll zone. No TikTok, no Instagram, no YouTube shorts. Let your brain normalize quiet. Yes, it’ll suck at first. But by Day 2, you’ll feel your thoughts get clearer.

**5. Replace, don’t just remove**  
You can’t just delete the apps and sit there. Replace scrolling with long walks, reading, journaling, podcasts while doing chores. Doing *something* intentional helps break the loop. James Clear, in *Atomic Habits*, suggests pairing a new activity (like reading) with an existing cue (like morning coffee). It builds a new reward system.

**6. Your attention is the most valuable currency**  
A 2023 Deloitte Digital Media Report confirms that younger people feel “always online” but rarely present. The brands fighting for your attention know its value. When you reclaim your own attention, it’s not just focus you’re getting back. It’s agency, creativity, and peace.

You don’t need to quit your phone. Just stop letting it own you.",1,1771324072.0,Menscomeback,0,1.0,False

Phew, it's exhausting!

Some days I genuinely wonder who decided that working full time *and* building a business on the side was a sustainable personality trait.

You clock out… but you don’t really clock out. There’s always another email, another idea, another “quick thing” to fix. Weekdays blur into weekends. Your screen time is embarrassing. Your brain never shuts up.

And being single while doing all this? It’s peaceful… but also sometimes you just want someone to split the mental load with. Or at least remind you to eat something other than cereal at 11pm.

But then I step outside here in Malta. The sea’s right there. The sky is dramatic. Yes, it’s ridiculously windy. My hair has accepted defeat.

Still, I’m building something. I’m growing. I’m in Malta. And even on the chaotic days, that feels like a pretty good place to be.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

Like many of you here, my morning ritual has long revolved around a **Double Espresso**. We’re all chasing that mental clarity and physical drive to power through the day, but I was tired of the inevitable 11 AM ""crash.""

Recently, I’ve been experimenting with **Shilajit**, specifically sourced from the **Altai Mountains**, and the difference compared to typical Himalayan sources is quite remarkable.

**Why Altai over Himalaya?** In doing my due diligence and talking to other enthusiasts, I realized the Altai region remains one of the most pristine and less-traveled areas compared to the highly commercialized zones of the Himalayas.

* **Raw Purity:** Higher elevation and less industrial/tourist interference.
* **Mineral Density:** The fulvic acid concentration seems to provide a much more stable absorption rate.

**My ""Focus"" Protocol:** Instead of stacking more caffeine, I now add a small pea-sized amount of Altai Shilajit directly into my first espresso.

1. The earthy flavor actually complements the bitterness of the coffee surprisingly well.
2. **The Result:** No jitters, consistent energy levels, and most importantly, a very ""calm"" and sustainable sense of focus.

Has anyone else experimented with the difference between Altai and Himalayan origins? I’m curious to hear your thoughts on long-term energy stability and if you've noticed a difference in mineral potency.",1,1771323969.0,AltaiShilajit,0,1.0,False

She walked past my table, and I swear the entire atmosphere shifted. It wasn't overpowering.. or synthetic like most perfumes. It was warm, layered, and somehow both elegant and inviting at the same time.

She had everything together. Her outfit, her confidence, her presence. But it was the scent that I couldn't stop thinking about even hours later.

I couldn't pick out which specific fragrance it was, and I wouldn't be surprised if she'd mixed multiple oil perfumes together to create her own signature blend. That's what made it so unique and captivating.

I wanted it so badly to just walk up to her and ask what she was wearing, but I completely froze. I didn't have the courage or the right moment to approach her without seeming weird. So she left, and I was stuck with this incredible scent memory and zero information...

The second I got home, I started researching. I looked up oil perfumes, fragrance layering techniques, and different scent profiles. The more I read, the more fascinated I became. But it's also pretty confusing. There are so many options, so many combinations, and I have no idea where to even start.

I found some highly rated oil perfume sets online, but I'm worried that knowing myself, I might just end up buying a bunch and never actually using them because I'll be too overwhelmed by choice. I'm also thinking about making a bulk purchase on alibaba and gifting a starter collection to my younger sister. She's been talking about wanting to start a small business, and I think curated oil perfume sets could actually be a really unique niche for her to explore.

But back to that woman. I still can't stop thinking about her scent. And her entire outfit was a whole vibe on its own too, but that's a story for another day.",1,1771323918.0,FemFragLab,1,0.67,False

1r72d9d,https://i.redd.it/g6ddga1j61kg1.jpeg,A Former Gangster Boss’s Possession of a Housekeeper in an R-19 Novel chapters 70 to 72,"Unfortunately, I failed to knock down Park Ha-joon, the scammer.

That day was the last time I saw him, and before I could even catch him, he kissed me and ran away as if he was fleeing for his life.

And so, my farewell with Park Ha-joon ended with a kiss.

And the next day….

""Hello.""

'Park Ha-na…'

A savory smell wafted out, and when I came out of my room, I saw Park Ha-na cooking.

For a moment, I thought I wasn't fully awake. I reflexively rubbed my eyes.

Even after looking again, it was definitely Park Ha-na. She looked just like Park Ha-joon, but her overall vibe was quite different.

I heard she was coming today, but she arrived so early?

I nodded my head slightly and responded to her greeting. Park Ha-na smiled brightly at my greeting.

Her flower-like smile and the apron with flowers painted on it suited her quite well, no, very well.

Judging by her demeanor, it seemed like she, not me, was the one who had been working here longer.

""...Are you cooking?""

""Yes. I'm a little embarrassed, but I tried making something. I made it, but I don't know if it will taste good. Would you like to try some?""

Park Ha-na's cooking….

Come to think of it, Park Ha-joon's cooking wasn't great. What would Park Ha-na's cooking be like?

In the novel, it was described that Park Ha-na's cooking was really delicious. That's why I wanted to try it at least once.

With a hopeful heart, I approached Park Ha-na's side.

""Kimchi stew?""

""Yes. Here you go. Ah~""

She's got the charm down pat.

I paused for a moment, taken aback by Park Ha-na's aegyo, as she naturally blew on the spoon and brought it towards my mouth.

Should I eat it, or not?

I hesitated for a moment, but I didn't want to refuse her offer, and I was also curious about the taste of Park Ha-na's food, so I took it.

""How is it?""

""Hmm. It's good.""

I was impressed.

I was being sincere. It was really delicious.

The description in the novel wasn't a lie. It's really good.

At this rate, even Jung Hwan-gyu, who throws a fit if it's not my cooking, would probably say, ""It's delicious?"" and let it slide.

""It's delicious, right? I'm quite good at cooking.""

Park Ha-na shrugged her shoulders.

Her confident face seemed genuine, unlike the fake pretense she had displayed earlier. Maybe that's her true self.

Of course, Park Ha-na shyly smiled again, as if she had never been so confident. It didn't even take a second for her to change.

She's really amazing….

I stared blankly at her and then moved away, pretending not to notice.

No, I was about to move away.

""Hey! You two, what are you doing!""

If it hadn't been for Jung Hwan-gyu's shout.

It seemed that Jung Hwan-gyu, who had come downstairs earlier than usual today, saw me and Park Ha-na unintentionally sticking together.

With his face flushed red, Jung Hwan-gyu strode over and reached out to grab my wrist.

But I was faster.

'Not a chance…'

I avoided Jung Hwan-gyu's hand and stepped back. Jung Hwan-gyu's hand stopped in mid-air.

If it were any other time, I might have let him grab me, but Park Ha-na was watching.

I was already bothered by Jung Hwan-gyu's unnecessary nonsense, and I didn't want to cause any unnecessary misunderstandings by having physical contact with him.

It would be a problem if Park Ha-na, who had to seduce the brothers, felt a sense of rivalry towards me.

I should keep my distance from now on.

""Let's have… let's have a meal.""

I quickly corrected myself to use polite language, when I was about to speak informally without realizing it.

Jung Hwan-gyu glared at me with a constipated expression.

""Hey, you! You dodged my hand?""

""Please, take a seat.""

""...You!""

Jung Hwan-gyu glared at me fiercely, but I wasn't the kind of person to be intimidated by his gaze.

When Park Ha-na wasn't looking, I glared back at Jung Hwan-gyu.

Aren't you going to sit down? Do you want to die?

Fortunately, my gaze seemed to work, and Jung Hwan-gyu hesitated for a moment before sitting down.

But his eyes were still blazing.

He had a lot to say to me, but I ignored him.

""Hi, brothers…. Oh? A pretty lady.""

""Hello. Youngest Master. My name is Park Ha-young, and I'll be working here from today. Please take care of me.""

""Huh? Oh. I heard. You too, please take care of me.""

Soon after, Jung Hwan-young came to his seat and sat down. Jung Hwan-young was very disappointed that Park Ha-joon had left.

But as if this wasn't the first time this had happened, he quickly composed himself.

That probably meant that many housekeepers had worked and quit in this house.

""Huh~? What's with the atmosphere?""

At that moment, Jung Hwan-seo yawned and approached the table and sat down.

These days, he hadn't been showing his face in the morning because he was running errands for Jung Hwan-hee, so it had been a while since we had a meal together like this.

""Hello. Maid Two.""

""...Hello. My name isn't Maid Two... it's Park Ha-young.""

In an instant, Park Ha-na's brow furrowed slightly as Jung Hwan-seo called her Maid Two.

It was such a subtle change that no one seemed to notice, but I had experienced her true personality firsthand, and it was mentioned in the book, so I knew that Park Ha-na was quite upset right now.

Well, of course, Park Ha-na, of all people, wouldn't be happy to be called Maid Two….

She had always been treated like a princess wherever she went, so it was inevitable that she would be annoyed.

'But Jung Hwan-seo…. He doesn't seem interested at all?'

Even in the book, Jung Hwan-seo didn't know Park Gyu-min's name, but he always called Park Ha-na by her name.

Last time, she went into Jung Hwan-seo's room, so I thought their love line would continue, but there wasn't anything special after all?

""Oh, right. I'm hungry. Give me food. Gyu-min.""

""Huh? Oh, yes.""

""What's this? Why are you calling Park Gyu-min by his name so affectionately all of a sudden? You usually call him housekeeper?""

I was also surprised. What's gotten into him suddenly?

Jung Hwan-seo rested his chin on his hand with a look that said, ""Is that even a question?"" and said lazily.

""We have Maid Two now. If I call him Maid One, it'll be confusing, so I'm calling him by his name. How is it? I'm smart, right?""

Jung Hwan-gyu scoffed at Jung Hwan-seo's words.

""Tsk, there's so much to be confused about. Where's the eldest brother?""

""He'll probably come around lunchtime? He must have a lot of things to take care of.""

""...Brothers. Is eldest brother coming later?""

In an instant, Jung Hwan-young's face brightened up as he listened to their conversation in silence.

He had been waiting for Jung Hwan-hee to come since yesterday, so it was a natural reaction, in a way.

""Yeah. He's coming. He's here. You'll be seeing him all the time now. The eldest brother you like, you little rascal.""

""Yay!""

Jung Hwan-young shouted excitedly. Was he really that happy?

Well, Jung Hwan-hee was the one who cared about and took care of Jung Hwan-young the most out of the three.

It was only natural that he would be more attached to the one who cherished him more.

I listened to the brothers' conversation with one ear and let it out with the other, diligently setting the table.

Soon, the table was filled with dishes made by Park Ha-na.

I wonder what the brothers' reactions will be?

Because Park Ha-na and I were in the kitchen together, Jung Hwan-gyu didn't seem to realize who had made the food yet.

At that moment, Jung Hwan-gyu picked up a spoon and put the soup in his mouth.

Even though the taste might be a little different from what I made, Park Ha-na's kimchi stew was quite delicious.

In the book, as soon as Park Ha-na came to this house, she immediately won over the brothers' taste buds with her cooking.

I watched Jung Hwan-gyu's reaction with interest. Jung Hwan-gyu's Adam's apple bobbed up and down.

Soon after, Jung Hwan-gyu's brow furrowed terribly.

""...It's not good. You didn't make this, did you?""

""Pardon?""

I looked at Jung Hwan-gyu with surprised eyes. Park Ha-na was the same.

""...Yeah, it's not good.""

""What is this? It's not good. Housekeeper hyung didn't make this, did he?""

It wasn't just Jung Hwan-gyu. Jung Hwan-seo and Jung Hwan-young, who tasted the food after him, had the same reaction.

""N-not good…? I'm quite good at cooking, you know…. It can't be not good….""

Park Ha-na stammered in embarrassment.

Jung Hwan-gyu frowned at Park Ha-na's reaction, realizing that I hadn't made the food.

Jung Hwan-gyu immediately put down his spoon.

""No, it's not good. And why are you cooking? Before, your sister did the cleaning and Park Gyu-min did the cooking. So you should just do the cleaning. Don't do unnecessary things.""

""I agree. Maid Two should just do the cleaning.""

""I'd like that too.""

Jung Hwan-young, who was watching cautiously, said hesitantly.

In the midst of the commotion, I subtly watched Park Ha-na's actions.

Was she going to get angry? If it were her usual personality, she would have gotten angry a long time ago.

But perhaps because her sense of professionalism was strong, Park Ha-na showed desperate patience.

No, she even bowed her head deeply and then raised it again.

""I, I didn't know you wouldn't like my cooking. I thought I did my best….""

In that short amount of time, Park Ha-na's eyes were filled with tears.

She looked so helpless and frail. It seemed like she was trying to stimulate the men's protective instincts.

Is this what they call a tearful attack? That was definitely Park Ha-na.

But unfortunately, it didn't work on the brothers.

""If that's your best, then don't do it again.""

""I agree~ I don't usually picky with food, but Gyu-min's cooking is better.""

""It's more delicious when housekeeper hyung makes it.""

""...Yes. I understand. Then I'll go clean.""

The tears disappeared from Park Ha-na's eyes.

I thought they would at least be a little shaken by the tears of a beauty, but I was also a little surprised that no one paid any attention to her.

Park Ha-na pouted her lips and lowered her head again like a dejected puppy.

It was a pitiful gesture, but again, no one paid any attention to her.

Jung Hwan-gyu left with a warning not to cook again, and Jung Hwan-young also left, as if he couldn't swallow his food even after eating half of it.

Jung Hwan-seo seemed to be counting the rice grains and then went upstairs, saying he was sleepy.

'It was quite delicious, but is it not as good as what I make?'

Now, only Park Ha-na and I were left in the kitchen.

I glanced at Park Ha-na. As if she had never been dejected, Park Ha-na chased after the figures of the brothers as they left, her eyes filled with murderous intent.

'This is a big problem…'

Park Ha-na was the type of person who couldn't stand being taken advantage of.

I had a feeling that the things that would happen in the future would be quite difficult, unlike in the book.

""Hello.""

Around lunchtime, Jung Hwanhee finally came home.

I was in the middle of explaining the layout of the house and how to clean to Park Hana when I saw Jung Hwanhee entering through the front door, and I stopped walking.

""Hello, CEO.""

I bowed my head 90 degrees as I greeted him.

Jung Hwanseo said he would be here around lunchtime, and he really did arrive right at 12 o'clock.

It's been a while since I saw Jung Hwanhee, and although he looks a little tired, he's still as handsome as a sculpture.

Jung Hwanhee, pushing up his glasses, looked back and forth between me and Park Hana.

Then, Park Hana stepped forward.

Park Hana, whose mood had been quite soured by the brothers, smiled brightly, unlike how she had been listening to my explanations with one ear and letting them out the other. She greeted Jung Hwanhee affably.

""...Nice to meet you, CEO. I've heard a lot about you from my sister. My name is Park Hayoung.""

""Ah, that...""

I never imagined I'd be watching Jung Hwanhee and Park Hana's first meeting like this, so I watched them with a fascinating look on my face.

Jung Hwanhee looked at Park Hana with a slightly surprised expression, but then his face became expressionless again as if he had never made that expression.

...Is he smitten? Is he smitten?

I stared intently at Jung Hwanhee's face, trying to read his expression.

Then, Jung Hwanhee's gaze turned to me.

""I look forward to working with you too. And Park Gyumin.""

""Yes?""

""Is everyone out?""

""Yes. They're all out. I think they'll be back around dinner time.""

""Is that so? I'm hungry... Could you prepare a meal?""

""Yes, I understand.""

With those words, Jung Hwanhee said he was going to go wash up and went upstairs.

It was a more subdued reaction than I expected.

It was lunchtime, and I was about to prepare a meal anyway, so I headed straight to the kitchen.

But as a housekeeper, this is my first time preparing a meal for Jung Hwanhee, isn't it?

Whenever Jung Hwanhee came, we always ate out, so there was no need for me to prepare a meal separately.

Wait a minute... But what if he notices something after eating my cooking?

Suddenly, I felt uneasy.

Nah, no way. How much time has passed? There's no way he'd remember that...

I tried to dismiss it, but I kept thinking about Jung Hwanhee calling out Kim Han Yul's name without forgetting it.

But even so, I can't just not give the CEO food when he asks for it.

I pushed aside my uneasy feelings and approached the refrigerator.

""Excuse me.""

""...Yes?""

Then, when I turned around at the sudden call, Park Hana was standing behind me, having followed me all the way to the kitchen. I stopped walking and looked at Park Hana.

Park Hana's eyes sparkled, and she gave me an earnest look. I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable.

Whenever Park Hana made that face, she would ask for a favor, so I wondered what she was going to ask this time.

""...The CEO hasn't eaten a lot of meals cooked here, right?""

""I think this is the first time, as far as I remember? He always ate out whenever he came.""

""Really?""

At my words, Park Hana's face brightened up. It was as if she thought, 'This is it!'

Her eyes momentarily shone sharply like those of a predator trying to catch prey, but soon returned to the gentle eyes of a lamb, as if she had never made such an expression.

""Then, would it be okay if I prepared lunch?""

""...Yes?""

""Gyumin unni prepares breakfast and dinner, right? And you helped me clean earlier... I'm so sorry. Please let me make one meal a day. I want to help Gyumin unni.""

She sure knows how to talk.

She's really beating around the bush saying she wants to look good to Jung Hwanhee.

She says it's for me, but I doubt it's really for me.

But I hesitated for a moment and then nodded.

Her excuse was absurd, but this wasn't a bad idea for me either.

I was worried that Jung Hwanhee would recognize me as Kim Han Yul after eating my cooking, but if Park Hana cooked, I wouldn't have to worry about that.

""Then, I'll leave it to you.""

""Yes!""

At my words, Park Hana answered cheerfully.

I left the kitchen to Park Hana and went outside.

From behind, I could hear Park Hana humming as she cooked.

I pondered for a moment and then headed to my room.

I had finished most of the housework, so I thought I'd rest in my room for a while to avoid disturbing Jung Hwanhee and Park Hana.

I went into my room and lay down on the floor.

'...I'm sleepy.'

As I lay still, sleep began to overcome me.

I checked the time. Should I just sleep for a little while and wake up?

If there's anything urgent, Park Hana will call me, so I closed my eyes slightly.

* * *

""Hmm.""

I slowly opened my eyes.

How long did I sleep?

I slept soundly without even dreaming.

The room, which had been bright before I went to sleep, was now dark. It seemed I had fallen asleep for quite a while.

I hurriedly turned on the light in the room and turned on my phone to check the time.

'It's already 7 o'clock?'

It was time to prepare dinner. I quickly got up and went outside.

I didn't expect anyone to not wake me up even at this hour.

""Are you going to work?""

""I'm sad. I wish you could eat the dinner I made before you left...""

""I'll prepare a lunch box for you starting tomorrow.""

""Is there anything else you need?""

Then, I heard a chattering voice from the front door.

I wondered what was going on and went over to see Park Hana standing close to Jung Hwanhee, dusting off the dust from his shoulder and adjusting the fit of his suit.

The words from just now were all addressed to Jung Hwanhee.

The apathetic look that Jung Hwanhee had when he came during the day was gone, and he was looking at Park Hana with a slightly relaxed look in his eyes.

'...Oh, their relationship has gotten incredibly close while I was sleeping?'

Come to think of it, Jung Hwanhee was the first target to be seduced. It must have been easier to seduce him since there were no obstacles.

Judging by his expression, Jung Hwanhee seemed to have fallen completely for Park Hana's charms.

""I'm off.""

""Yes. Have a good day!""

Jung Hwanhee left the house after receiving Park Hana's warm send-off.

""...Oh? You're awake?""

Park Hana, who had turned around after closing the front door, looked at me with surprised eyes as if she had just found me.

""Yes. You've gotten very close to the CEO, haven't you?""

""The CEO is very considerate of me as a new worker. I'm so grateful.""

Yes, yes. I'm sure you are.

""But where is the CEO going?""

""The CEO said he has some business to take care of in the evening. He said he'll be busy with work for about a month, so he'll be going out often. He doesn't usually eat breakfast, so he only asked me to prepare lunch. I'm planning to take full charge of the CEO's meals starting tomorrow. Is that okay?""

""Yes, go ahead.""

Well, a mafia boss isn't going to be so free that he's just at home all the time.

I nodded and subtly checked beside me to see that Park Hana had a determined and confident look on her face.

It seemed that the frustration she had accumulated from being ignored and mistreated by Jung Hwanseo and Jung Hwankyu had been greatly relieved by Jung Hwanhee.

I headed to the kitchen to prepare dinner.

But when I entered the kitchen, I couldn't help but frown.

The lunch dishes were still left in the sink.

What time is it, and they're still like this?

""Oh, I was chatting with the CEO, so I forgot to do the dishes. What should I do?""

Park Hana looked at me with an earnest look again.

Because I had often accepted her requests when she made that expression, she now tries to use it from time to time.

What do you mean, 'What should I do?'

""You should do them since there's still time.""

""...Yes?""

""I said do them. Call me when you're done.""

I left the kitchen, leaving Park Hana, who had a dumbfounded look on her face, behind.

It seems like she left them thinking I would do them, but no way.

If I accept it once, I'll have to do everything.

I won't do everything for Park Hana like in the book, no matter what.

Of course, I'm willing to support her love line, but that's that, and this is this.

'Come to think of it, I wonder if Jung Hwanyoung is home yet?'

I turned around to go to Jung Hwanyoung's room. Then, I heard a small voice in my ear.

""...Damn it. Did I get him or not?""

'Hmm, I think she's talking to me?'

Thinking I had gone into my room, Park Hana was cursing and talking to herself, so I stopped and eavesdropped.

""I have to get revenge from last time too... Just you wait.""

It's so strange.

Why is she bothering to talk to herself in a house where she came to be a spy? Is it a novelistic license?

I didn't realize it when I read the book, but actually hearing the heroine's soliloquy like this is absurd.

What if the other brothers had heard it if I hadn't? Tsk.

I clicked my tongue inwardly and listened carefully.

But I didn't hear any more soliloquies, and I heard the sound of water running. It seemed she was going to do the dishes.

I moved my steps again.

Before long, I saw Jung Hwanyoung's door. I approached the door and knocked.

""Young Master, may I come in?""

I didn't hear any noise from inside.

It was quiet, so I wondered if he was taking a nap, so I carefully opened the door and went inside.

The room was dark.

I closed the door and turned on my phone's light slightly, then used it as a light and approached the bed.

On the bed, Jung Hwanyoung was breathing softly as he slept.

'He's sleeping soundly.'

His cheeks moving whenever he sleeps are so lovely.

I want to poke his cheeks, but I'm afraid he'll wake up, so I moved my steps.

I haven't prepared dinner yet, so I was going to let him sleep a little longer until I finished preparing the meal.

Then, I suddenly noticed a notebook on the desk.

I wondered what it was and looked at it, and I saw some scribbled letters.

'Oh? Is it handwriting practice? Or a diary?'

He's from a great Alpha family, so he seems to write the letters quite neatly even though he's a kindergartener.

Curiously, I looked to see what he had written, and it was a diary with his daily life written in it.

And after reading all the written words, my face slowly began to harden.
My oldest brother is coming home today.

I had been waiting for this day, so I rushed home as soon as kindergarten was over.

But when I got there, my brother was with the housekeeper.

They seemed closer than me and my brother.

I felt left out.

The series of slightly awkward yet endearing sentences pointed to jealousy towards Park Hana.

It seemed that even with Jeong Hwan-yeong's arrival, Jeong Hwan-hee was too busy talking to Park Hana to pay proper attention to him.

Or perhaps he was too engrossed in their cozy interaction.

But that wasn't what bothered me.

The problem was the sentences below.

I keep feeling like someone is watching me.

Am I imagining it? Whenever I play in the playground, a man in black clothes stares at me.

He disappears in a flash when I run to the teacher.

It's strange. It's scary.

I hope he's not a bad person like last time.

Should I tell my brother?

But what if he's busy and worries because of me?

Let's just not say anything. I probably just imagined it.

'Could it be…'

The beginning of a kidnapping?

In fact, the previous kidnapping was a story that occurred before the episode even began.

But now that Park Hana has officially appeared, and the paused episodes have started to play out again?

Jeong Hwan-yeong's kidnapping was also one of the episodes that happened after Park Hana came.

If that's the case, then Jeong Hwan-yeong might get kidnapped again, just like I worried before.

'...This isn't necessarily a good thing, if it's going back to the original story.'

Jeong Hwan-yeong was already terrified from the previous kidnapping...

Fortunately, their relationship recovered afterward, and everything ended well, so it doesn't seem like he has any lasting trauma, but if the same thing happens again, there's no guarantee it will end well this time.

I should give Jeong Hwan-hee a heads-up.

""I'm sorry, Master.""

I felt bad for Jeong Hwan-yeong, but I took a picture of his diary with my phone and went outside.

'I couldn't protect him last time...'

I'll make sure to protect him this time.

So Jeong Hwan-yeong doesn't get hurt the same way again.

* * *

Since Park Hana came, the usual morning scene had changed a bit.

It used to be Jeong Hwan-yeong and Jeong Hwan-gyu bickering, but now it was Jeong Hwan-gyu and Park Hana.

""Aww, why don't you like the food I made?""

""Because it's not good.""

""Just try one bite, please~""

""No. Ugh, Park Gyu-min. Do something about her!""

Park Hana was amazing. She wasn't fazed by Jeong Hwan-gyu's attitude and instead became even more proactive.

Jeong Hwan-gyu couldn't bring himself to get angry at Park Hana, who kept approaching and taking care of him, so he hid behind me, unable to do anything.

It seemed like he was weak against that kind of approach.

Park Hana's tactic was working well. At this rate, she'd become close to Jeong Hwan-gyu in no time.

""...Are you having breakfast?""

Just then, Jeong Hwan-hee came into the kitchen, yawning.

As soon as Park Hana saw Jeong Hwan-hee, she quickly made coffee and brought it to him, sitting next to Jeong Hwan-gyu, as if she hadn't been paying attention to him at all.

""Sir, I made this coffee myself. I hope you like it.""

""Ah, thank you.""

Jeong Hwan-hee usually had coffee for breakfast, so he was glad he didn't have to prepare a separate meal.

""First Brother!""

Jeong Hwan-yeong came out rubbing his eyes and, noticing Jeong Hwan-hee sitting in the chair before him, ran and hugged him.

Jeong Hwan-hee stroked Jeong Hwan-yeong's head with an adoring look and said,

""Did you sleep well, our youngest?""

""Yeah! I slept well!""

Jeong Hwan-yeong answered energetically, like a little chick.

Jeong Hwan-hee smiled warmly as he looked at Jeong Hwan-yeong.

""You're going to go to kindergarten strong today, right?""

""Yeah! I will! But, um...""

""...Hmm? What is it?""

Jeong Hwan-yeong trailed off. He seemed to want to say something.

Jeong Hwan-hee met Jeong Hwan-yeong's gaze as if telling him to speak.

""Um, it's nothing!""

After hesitating, Jeong Hwan-yeong shook his head.

Jeong Hwan-hee studied Jeong Hwan-yeong for a moment before whispering kindly,

""Youngest.""

""Yeah?""

""Your brothers are always on your side. If something happens, or even if nothing happens but you're worried about something, you need to tell us right away. We'll help you with anything. Okay?""

""...Yeah! I understand!""

Jeong Hwan-yeong's face brightened at Jeong Hwan-hee's words. At that moment, my eyes met Jeong Hwan-hee's.

I had sent him the picture I took of Jeong Hwan-yeong's diary in the morning since it didn't seem like we'd have time to talk separately.

We often exchanged texts about Jeong Hwan-hee and Jeong Hwan-yeong, so it wasn't awkward to send a text.

Judging by his expression, he seemed to have taken the contents of Jeong Hwan-yeong's diary to heart.

Jeong Hwan-hee cares about Jeong Hwan-yeong a lot, and he regretted not handling the previous kidnapping properly, so he wouldn't take even a child's diary lightly.

He'll probably strengthen the security even more, right?

Still, I should be more careful just in case.

""Where's Jeong Hwan-seo?""

""Ah, Second Brother? He said he was too busy because of you to look for his Pretty, and he's going to start looking again today.""

It was Jeong Hwan-gyu who answered Jeong Hwan-hee's question. I paused at Jeong Hwan-gyu's words.

I had been relieved that he hadn't been talking about his ""Pretty"" lately, but it seemed like it was starting again.

He's so persistent. How can he not forget?

""Pretty...""

Jeong Hwan-hee also knew about the ""Pretty,"" and sighed.

At that moment, Park Hana, who had been observing, subtly joined the conversation.

""Um, who's Pretty?""

""You don't need to know.""

""Jeong Hwan-gyu. I told you not to be so aggressive.""

""What did I do? You're always like that with me.""

Jeong Hwan-gyu pouted. Still, while Jeong Hwan-gyu would talk back to Jeong Hwan-seo, he couldn't defy Jeong Hwan-hee.

""She exists. Jeong Hwan-seo's destined omega.""

""Ah, destined omega?""

Park Hana's eyes sparkled. She must have heard it from Park Ha-jun, but that's her reaction... Was she pretending not to know?

Or maybe she was trying to get information about the ""Pretty.""

But they probably don't know much about the ""Pretty"" either.

That's because it's me.

That's how things can be hidden in plain sight.

""We've never seen her either. According to Hwan-seo, she came and went like the wind.""

""...Huh?""

Park Hana looked like she didn't understand.

""Is that omega really the Second Master's destined omega? If it's destiny, the omega would have noticed too... For her to suddenly disappear... It doesn't make sense.""

Park Hana whispered, as if trying to plant a seed of doubt in the brothers' minds.

It was a lighthearted comment, but the brothers paused at her words.

The truth about Jeong Hwan-seo's destined omega might be starting to waver.

It seemed like Park Hana didn't like the idea of Jeong Hwan-seo's destined omega.

Don't worry, Park Hana.

I have no intention of appearing as the ""Pretty.""

Jeong Hwan-hee nodded at Park Hana's words.

""We're also half-doubtful. Well, if she exists somewhere, he's looking so hard that he'll meet her soon.""

""...Yeah. I hope he finds her.""

Park Hana replied soullessly.

As breakfast ended, all the brothers except Jeong Hwan-hee went out.

Jeong Hwan-hee leisurely sat on the couch, reading documents and watching TV.

Then, Park Hana, who was cleaning nearby, kept glancing at the documents Jeong Hwan-hee was holding.

'She must be curious about what's written there.'

Well, Park Hana is a spy after all.

I secretly watched Park Hana as I dusted around.

Park Hana seemed to hesitate for a moment, then stopped cleaning and went into the kitchen to bring out a plate of snacks.

Then she approached Jeong Hwan-hee.

'Oh?'

Is she finally starting to make her move?

""Here, have some while you work.""

""Ah, it's okay.""

""Just have a little bit. It's not good to only work. You need to take breaks in between.""

With those words, Park Hana grabbed Jeong Hwan-hee's sleeve.

Jeong Hwan-hee's eyes went to his sleeve that Park Hana was pulling.

I couldn't see what kind of look he had since I was a bit far away, but he was probably swaying with Park Hana's charm.

Sure enough, Jeong Hwan-hee nodded after a while.

At Jeong Hwan-hee's nod, Park Hana naturally sat next to Jeong Hwan-hee.

Then she picked up a cookie and held it in front of Jeong Hwan-hee's mouth.

""Here, say 'ahh' and eat it.""

""...I'll take it myself.""

Jeong Hwan-hee took the cookie from Park Hana and put it in his mouth.

I thought he would gladly accept it, but has he not opened his heart that much yet?

No, maybe he was too nervous and refused.

I watched them with great interest, feeling like I was watching a morning drama.

""Have some tea, too. You had coffee this morning, so I prepared black tea this time.""

""...It's good.""

Park Hana poured tea for Jeong Hwan-hee.

Jeong Hwan-hee took a sip and put the tea down with the cliché remark that it was good.

'Jeong Hwan-hee doesn't like black tea... Why did she choose that of all things?'

She should have asked me instead.

Still, Jeong Hwan-hee took a sip out of courtesy, but he didn't touch the tea after that. The same went for the cookies.

Jeong Hwan-hee completely lost interest in the snacks and picked up the documents again.

At the same time, Park Hana's eyes sharpened.

Park Hana got up as if to clear the dishes, then stumbled and fell onto Jeong Hwan-hee.

""Eek! I-I'm so sorry. My legs gave out... Are you okay?""

'...Wow, impressive?'

I was genuinely amazed.

Park Hana, who had fallen onto Jeong Hwan-hee, rubbed her chest against Jeong Hwan-hee's chest and then naturally placed her foot between Jeong Hwan-hee's legs, subtly brushing his private parts with her foot.

To do so much in such a short time...

Park Hana, with a seemingly innocent look as if it were all a mistake, looked at Jeong Hwan-hee.

Jeong Hwan-hee's face was hidden by Park Hana.

'Is this where the 19+ content comes in?'

The contents of the book, which described their licentious lives where they would strip and have sex just by making eye contact, came to mind, and I reflexively wondered if I should leave.

Just then, Jeong Hwan-hee's voice was heard.",1,1771323616.0,u_AssistantNo6987,0,1.0,False

Whenever I tried to “live in the end,” it felt forced. Either too dramatic, or too vague. Big celebrations, huge business wins, people congratulating me… it never felt natural in SATS. It felt like I was trying to convince myself.

Recently I experimented with using AI to help structure scenes in a more Neville way. **Not to replace imagination, but to help me articulate it**. I asked for simple, ordinary moments that imply the wish is already fulfilled.

And something shifted.

Instead of imagining success itself, **I started imagining the** ***texture of daily life after it’s done***. 

The calm. The normalcy. The absence of tension.

These are some of the scenes I’ll be looping:

* I wake up without tension in my chest. I stretch slowly. The day feels spacious.
* I’m walking outside. My shoulders are relaxed. My mind is not racing ahead.
* I’m lying in bed at night. My thoughts are soft. I think, I handled today well.
* I’m cooking or making coffee. No podcast, no noise. Just quiet presence.
* I notice I’m breathing slowly without forcing it. My jaw is relaxed.
* I’m sitting with someone I care about. I’m fully there. Not half in the future.
* I go to sleep feeling complete, not chasing tomorrow.

What struck me is that the “end” doesn’t feel euphoric. It feels ordinary. Quiet. Stable.

It made me realize that maybe the feeling of the wish fulfilled is less about excitement and more about the absence of striving.

I’m honestly excited to add these to my evening SATS session tonight and see how they settle in.

If I should bring it up, i don’t really know how. 

I am 27 (f) and I started seeing ‘Jacob’ 42(m) in nyc about 8 months ago. He has a nesting partner (39f) who he has been seeing for around 12 yrs now (not nesting for all of that time). They have been poly for the whole relationship but when they started did not immediately start dating other people. 

I started thinking this would be a kinda casual thing but we are now very much in love and I sleep over at a few times per week at his apartment (My place doesn’t allow guests). Np and I get on and have a burgeoning independent friendship. I didn’t find the poly aspects TOO hard at first and have been on dates and kissed other people, and have someone who lives too far to see regularly who is a kinda comet partner. However since I fell really intensely for this guy, I am finding the polyamory much harder. 

I’m specifically finding it hella tough that me and ‘Jacob’ don’t seem to have “”our own experiences””. One super random thing which is bothering me is this; if he takes me to see a broadway show, bar on one occasion, it has been something him and his np have seen together before. The time we went to see something new, which was awesome, he then took her to see a coupla weeks later. He has seen (3) new shows with her in this time and hasn’t taken me to see any of them. It turned out his Christmas present to me was tickets for us for a show that him and his np saw two years ago. Theatre is a huge part of all our lives (I work in it) and it feels like this means we are not building our own new relationship. 

In addition, when we are in the house, if he is making coffee or a drink he will also always offer to np and once when we were out for lunch near his house recently, I asked what he had in the bag and he had also picked up lunch for her. Because we don’t have anywhere else to stay, this has the added impact of making me feel like we don’t have time which is just ‘for us’. 

If we go to restaurants locally to him, they are places he has been with NP before and likes and goes on dates with her there. The types of holidays we go on are the same types he’s been on with NP. The dates out of town that I thought were ‘our thing’ turn out to be also something he does with NP. He’s invited me to a big theatre event that means a lot to him, NP will also be there. 

I’m starting to feel like I don’t have my own relationship with this guy and he’s been really supportive recently and I don’t want to lose him because I keep talking about issues that I am having with a relationship which should be great. 

Please help! Any support or advice would be super appreciated. 

PS. He is able to stay at mine maybe one weekend in 4 months. We are going on our own short holiday to europe but this was my idea. ",1,1771322839.0,polyamory,6,1.0,False

1r724m5,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1r724m5/opening_a_petfriendly_specialty_coffee_café_in/,Opening a pet-friendly specialty coffee café in Hyderabad — would love input from this community,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been lurking here for a while and have learned a lot from the discussions, so I wanted to get some honest input as I’m in the process of opening a specialty coffee café in Sainikpuri, Hyderabad, over the next few months.

The concept is a pet-friendly, garden-style café with a strong focus on consistency and good espresso fundamentals. I want it to be a place where the coffee holds up on its own, not just something that looks good on Instagram.

On the equipment side, I’ve shortlisted a Rocket Espresso commercial machine (likely the Boxer or similar) because I’ve heard good things about their temperature stability, reliability, and overall shot quality in café settings. It also feels like a solid long-term investment rather than something I’ll outgrow quickly.

On the beans front, one of the roasters I’m seriously considering is Caramelly. What stood out to me is how approachable and espresso-friendly their profiles are. Their house blend felt balanced, forgiving, and something I can see working well as a daily-driver espresso that appeals to both enthusiasts and casual drinkers. Their pricing also seems sustainable from a café perspective without compromising quality.

I’m still evaluating other Indian roasters too, and I’d love input from people here who’ve worked with different beans in a café environment.

Some specific questions I’d really appreciate input on:

What makes you trust a café’s coffee program?

Is having a rock-solid house blend more important than rotating single origins?

How important are manual brews (V60, AeroPress, etc.) in Hyderabad?

What’s something cafés often get wrong with espresso?

What makes you return regularly to the same café?

How much does a barista's skill and knowledge influence your perception?

We’re also planning to bake croissants and bread fresh on-site and focus on creating a calm, slower experience rather than a high-turnover setup.

The goal is to build something sustainable and genuinely good — a place that coffee people would actually respect.

Would really appreciate honest input, even if it’s critical.

1r723u1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1r723u1/aio_for_thinking_my_office_mate_is_entitled/,AIO for thinking my office mate is entitled?,"Today started as what it seemed to be a promising day. After all, it’s gotten tens of degrees warmer and I was in a good mood overall. Well, that quickly changed once I got to my office.

I work as a researcher at a research institute within a university and I share an office with 3 more people. Generally, I am always kind of locked-in once I get to the office; I say “Hi” to whoever is there and will occasionally have small talk about work with some of my peers but I am primarily focused on getting work done—the more I yap the less I get done. I am actually the most senior office occupant. I have been using that office about 4 years now. Previous office mates have left and they were pleasant people to deal with.

The office has a mini fridge that people can put stuff in. I noticed as far as 2 weeks ago that someone left a 32 Oz Coffee Mate Creamer bottle (the $5 ones) and a written note next to the fridge saying: “feel free to use the creamer.” The bottle I believe was already partially opened and these things need to be consumed relatively fast as they can go bad rather quickly. So, I normally used the bottle over the last couple of days to the point where I actually ended up finishing it (only myself). As far as I know, I’m the only one in the office who drinks coffee regularly, and I thought whoever left the bottle there wouldn’t want it to go to waste since it been there for over a week.

Once I get to the office today, this guy ask me about the creamer and I respond: “the note states to use the creamer and since it’s been siting there over a week I used it over the past few days so it doesn’t go to waste.” He is like: “the whole bottle?” I reply back with “are we talking about the same creamer, this was a 32 oz bottle.” Then, he kind of start going off like: “this was for the whole office… \[blah blah, whatever\]… I didn’t expect for someone to use it all.” Note that I fully understand that I didn’t buy this $5 creamer and I am not entitled to use it unless given permission (which was given). However, the way he spoke to me, like lecturing me, pretty much ruining my mood, I didn’t like. I immediately stopped him and said: “I’ll be back in a few minutes.” I went to the nearest convenience store and bought the same bottle. Oooh, when I came back his face; he said: “oh, this was actually not necessary, I should have been a bit more clear with my note…” I said: “it’s ok, I don’t want to talk about it, in fact, I don’t want to talk at all” cutting him off completely and rather rudely, and immediately turning my focus towards my computer, so I could actually get work done.

Now, what really it’s been eating me is that this is the same guy who has been using pretty much all my books, taken them home, not telling me about it, and thus assuming that everything around him is for him only, whether it is his property or not. This actually has been bothering me for a while, as far as Summer 2025. I am very proprietary of my textbooks (call me a nerd idc), which aren’t cheap either (between $150-$300 each). I am happy to lend whatever (expensive) academic textbook I have but I would like to be asked first so I can keep track of where they are. After all, I have closer to $3000 spent on physical textbooks on the office shelve that I have bought over the course of my studies and research tenure. I don’t use the books daily but they are my property, and I believe it is disrespectful to just take whatever you need that isn’t yours without consulting the appropriate parties first. You don’t go to the library and take any book with you without officially borrowing them first; I believe this is considered theft and the university will literally hunt you down and withhold your degree (lol).

Naturally, I am not confrontational, especially in my work environment. But, I can’t conceptualize the idea that someone is throwing a fit because their about-to-be-expired $5 creamer was used while they have indiscriminately been using anything (mostly my stuff) they deem useful without even thinking of asking first as if everything that’s around them is public property and they are entitled to it. I have tried to find “nice corporate ways” to bring this up (not today but for a while) without causing drama. Also, the books are what bother me the most, but this “everything-is-for me” behavior has extended to my umbrella too, which I purposely leave at the office so I don’t have to carry it with me everywhere. There was an instance where I went to look for it on my way home because it was raining and the umbrella was nowhere to be found—I learned the next day the same guy took it the day before because “he thought it was shared office property.” WTF???

If I were to use things that aren’t mine without permission I wouldn’t certainly throw a fit because, well, I would be conscious that “oh shit, I actually have been using everything around here without even knowing who it belongs to, so perhaps it’s best for me to not say anything about my $5 creamer.”

**Summary:** office mate threw a fit because I used his $5 creamer which they stated it was fine to be used, while they been using mostly all my office property and I have not said anything about it… the fact that they aren’t conscious about, what I believe to be, their entitled behavior pisses me off so much.",2,1771322660.0,AIO,2,1.0,False

I've spent some time testing how to get the exact same HD/4K streams legally without the massive regional markup.

**The short version:** You can get legal UFC access for about **$3.10/month** if you know where to look.

**How it works:**

* **The Platforms:** In countries like Indonesia (Vidio) or India (Sony LIV), the UFC is significantly cheaper than in the US, UK, or Canada.
* **The Tool:** You need a VPN with solid servers in those specific regions to bypass the geo-blocks.

**Top 3 VPNs for this (Tested for 2026):**

1. **Surfshark:** Best for this specific hack because their Indonesia/India servers are extremely reliable and you get unlimited device connections.
2. **NordVPN:** The fastest for 4K. If you have a high-end setup and want zero latency, use NordLynx.
3. **CyberGhost:** Great if you’re new to VPNs—they have servers specifically labeled for streaming platforms.

**Quick Steps:**

1. Connect VPN to Indonesia.
2. Go to Vidio.
3. Enjoy the fight for the price of a coffee.

1r71zla,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1r71zla/rf_252_am/,[RF] 2:52 AM,"It was a Tuesday evening like any other in the cold, grey evening of Frankfurt. Veronica checked her Casio. It read 21:03—a solid three minutes after the time Abhishek was supposed to be back home. Veronica went back to reading her book with mild annoyance. For some reason, all of their wedding photos were missing from the living room. She didn’t notice it. Her book was on the wrong chapter. Everything was so annoying at once.



Abhishek Sharma was the son of the biggest businessman in India. He was handsome, tall, fit, polite, calm—everything a girl would want. Veronica remembered her mother adjusting her dress that night, whispering, ""Treat him well, okay? Let him touch you if he wants. His father is a goldmine. Satisfy him."" Veronica's father was an investor in Indian business. He thought marrying his daughter off to the Sharmas would bring his family closer to Abhishek’s rich father. Veronica took a deep breath, prepared herself for any ""touching"" Abhishek might do, and entered the room shyly. In the span of fifteen minutes, she found out that she had married one of the most innocent and soft souls she could imagine. Abhishek didn’t invade her privacy at all and talked like a gentleman the whole night.



Veronica checked her phone. There was no text, no call, no email, no voice notes—nothing.



""It's only been three minutes,"" she said to herself aloud in the empty room and went back to reading her book. She was only reading the words; her mind was somewhere else. She checked her watch again, and it had only been one more minute. She wouldn’t admit it, but she was scared.



She kept pacing around her room, making coffee, reheating dinner, reading her book, watching TV—anything to distract herself from the thought, What if something happened to Abhishek? A bead of sweat dropped from her forehead.



She checked her watch again. ""21:17."" She walked slightly faster than normal toward her phone, grabbed it, and with shaky fingers dialed Abhishek's number.



""The person you are trying to call has their phone switched off.""



Veronica was really jittery now, asking herself a million questions at once.



""Why would his phone be switched off?""

""He always keeps his phone charged.""

""He didn't even send a text.""



She closed her eyes. She was not religious, but the words slipped out of her mouth. ""God, please keep him safe.""



As her eyes were closed, her phone started ringing. A wave of joy hit her as she desperately opened her eyes. It was an unknown number.



""Abhishek must be calling from someone else's phone, right?"" she tried to reassure herself.



She picked up the phone and said too quickly, ""Hello, Abhishek?""



There was a pause on the other side, and then a lady spoke up in an official yet soft and sad voice. She must have been in her thirties.



""Hello, is this Veronica Seed?"" the lady asked softly—too softly.



""Y-Yes?"" Veronica's voice trembled with distant fear.



""Are you the wife of Abhishek Sharma?""



""Yes, is he alright?""



""I... don't know how to say this, um..."" The operator hesitated, and with all her resolve, she said, ""When Abhishek was driving on the southern highway, his car caught on fire. The details are still unknown, but he kept driving unknowingly, and in the middle of the road, his car exploded.""



A part of Veronica died on the spot. Tears fell. She froze. Her voice trembled.



""N-n-no, this can't be. He always comes back by 9 PM! Stop! This is a sick joke!""



The operator replied; it felt like she was on the brink of tears too. ""I am sorry, Veronica. I wish it was a joke.""



Veronica felt like she was about to puke, her whole body shaking violently. Her body had only shaken this badly during her nightmares. Even then, Abhishek held her tight so she could sleep. But now everything was done. Abhishek was gone. The pain was already too much as the operator spoke again.



""We... we, um... we..."" The hesitation was clear, but she spoke in a trembling voice. ""We were only able to find his... pieces.""



Veronica couldn’t take it anymore. She screamed and sobbed loudly, threw her phone, fell to the floor, and started shaking from sheer terror. Her mind imagined things—a burning car, pieces of a human on the road, blood, and many vile images.



She started hyperventilating and felt immense pain in her chest. She cried through it all. Slowly, the pain subsided, her vision went dark, and she fainted. The pain spread to her left arm. She tried breathing, but air refused to go in. Her head started to spin. She was puking without knowing it. Veronica passed away from a heart attack. Just like her beloved, her death was quick but painful. Every single sense was gone from her body. She saw nothing—not even black, just nothing. She heard nothing. It felt like she was not even in her body.



Suddenly, in front of her eyes, a scene played out. On the night of the marriage, Veronica's father had called Abhishek. In an overly polite tone, he asked, ""Abhishek, how are you? Do you need anything?"" Abhishek was polite; he couldn’t read people being cunning. ""Yes, I am fine, Dad. How are you? I don't need anything."" ""Oh no, you don't care about me, son! But one thing I forgot to tell you—Veronica has a weak heart, literally. Just don't give her too much stress. She has a condition. Tatsu—Tatsu—"" Abhishek cut him off, ""Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."" The father was embarrassed and happy at the same time. ""Yes! Yes! That! So just don't be too rough with her tonight, okay? Bye!""



Warmth...Warmth around her waist, like someone was holding her. Her back felt something warm too. She was sweaty, hyperventilating, and felt like she had just faced death. It felt like one of her nightmares. She opened her eyes, touched the hands surrounding her softly, turned around, and saw Abhishek sleeping peacefully, holding her after her nightmare. She felt happiness—pure, sudden, extreme happiness. She smiled—no, she grinned—and hugged Abhishek tightly. Abhishek was a deep sleeper, so she shook him.



""WAKE UP!""



Abhishek asked, ""What happened?"" in his sleepy, deep voice she loved. Veronica's eyes were teary as she woke him up and kissed him hard. Abhishek immediately woke up with wide eyes and his now rosy cheeks. After pulling back, Abhishek whispered, ""M-My first kiss..."" while Veronica just grinned, getting ready to kiss him again.",1,1771322248.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

My nan died last January, and we got my granddad moved much closer to us in the summer so he wouldn't be too lonely. We found a nice little retirement community where everybody gets their own flat and gets to live independently with low rent prices and some support where needed. 

Since he moved, we've been encouraging him to get involved in the activities put on in the community and make new friends, one of which involves a Thursday morning breakfast get-together. The staff members make the residents a bacon roll and a tea or coffee for a few quid, and then everyone sits down for a nice long chat. Granddad started talking to some of the ladies there to get the lay of the land, and he noticed after going for a few weeks that out of the 80+ residents, only about a dozen regulars ever showed up. One day he asked why, and one of these little old ladies claimed that many residents never even leave their flats these days because they're scared of ""The Gang"". 

  
When my family first heard about this, we were obviously concerned. We grew up in some rough areas in London and thought he meant that there was legit gang activity around the local neighbourhood, and that was what the elderly residents were justifiably scared of. Yeah... not the case. What this lady was referring to was a group of friends who lived in this retirement community who had apparently scared off some of the more timid residents. Granddad has tried setting up outtings like a bowling trip or the local cinema, and people have refused to go in case any members of The Gang are there. Members of the Gang are apparently also on sort of members' board that dictates how the place is run. Granddad's a bit wishy-washy on the details of that part of the story, but they don't seem to actually have much of a say.

We'll never know the whole story because people won't open up about it, but my parents and I have theorised that the real story is likely that this group are a bit loud, boisterous and opinionated about how the place should be run, and the the people outside this group got a bit scared off and now just convince any new residents that they're utterly terrifying. The Gang just make me thing of The Plastics from Mean Girls, but I do love a bit of old people drama!",5,1771321987.0,h3h3productions,0,1.0,False

**The Scientist**

   

Can you kill God?

   

That question irritated Yang Xiaoming like a particularly annoying scab.

  

He passed by a man in a lab coat. The man bowed briefly. Yang Xiaoming kept walking, papers in hand.

   

A month ago, his research on nuclear fission engines was terminated, its budget stripped after his partner's sacrilegious statement at the 2106 Global Scientific Summit: 

   

*We must kill God.*

   

That statement alone caused his research to be ruined, his reputation tarnished, and his career destroyed. All because of a single statement. And now he treats my house as his personal post office! Xiaoming thought furiously.

   

The papers were delivered to his house this morning. At first, he was puzzled. Then he read the letter. He abandoned his breakfast, donned his favorite cardigan, and rushed to campus. Yang Xiaoming decided this farce ends *now.* After defending *that man,* he suffered nothing but mockery and ridicule. He must stop Liu Wei from his own madness. He’ll admit him to an institute if he has to.

  

With a heart full of resolve, Yang Xiaoming turned the knob to Liu’s office.



It was a rat’s nest.

   

The air was thick with the scent of coffee and cigarettes. Books were ragged, discarded, and scattered about. Messy stacks of research papers lay carelessly on the floor. Liu Wei himself stood behind an ebony wooden desk, cramming papers into his leather briefcase. As Yang Xiaoming entered, Liu Wei turned to face him.



“Ahhh, Xiao. Perfect timing. Hand me those papers, will you?”

   

But Xiaoming was far too occupied with his shock to answer.

   

“Stop staring, man! And give me those papers.”

   

He tried to snatch them away, but Yang Xiaoming was faster.

   

“What in the hell happened to you?” Xiaoming said.

   

Indeed, Liu’s current appearance could have made his own mother look twice. In the span of the year they were apart, Liu Wei’s once clean-cut hair had grown wild around his shoulders. His face was gaunt and pale like a ghost, save for his eyes, which still shone with the same piercing brilliance.



“I’m fine,” Liu said. “Outrageously fine. In fact, I feel reborn!”



He attempted a grin.

   

It reminded Xiaoming of a Homo habilis skull a paleontologist friend once showed him. 

   

Xiaoming suddenly grew conscious of truly how much Yan Er had fed him this last few months. He puffed his chest up like a great general going to war—moustache bristling.



“What the hell do you keep mailing to my home?” He slammed the papers down on the desk. “As if it wasn’t enough that you bother me with your silly antics.”

   

Liu gasped in delight and snatched them up like a boy receiving Christmas presents early. He read the letters eagerly, as if trying to pry out their secrets. Finally satisfied, he greeted Yang Xiaoming’s glare with a smile.

   

“Well, you were hardly less controversial, Xiao. What was it you called the Minister of Science?”

   

Xiaoming stiffened.

   

Liu tapped his chin. “Ah yes. ‘A brat still wet behind the ears, playing frog in a well.’”

  

“I was drunk!”

   

“Drunk. And addressing half the Senate. Fair is fair, old friend.”

   

Xiaoming collapsed into a nearby chair. His anger simmered down to annoyance. Rubbing his temples, he watched as Liu Wei stowed away the last of his prize in the briefcase.

   

“What do you plan now?” he asked.

  

“Want to come and see?” Liu replied.

   

Xiaoming closed his eyes. Knowing he would regret the coming words out of his mouth.

  

“Let me first call Yan Er.”

I need to type this out because I don't know who else to tell. My wife thinks I'm losing it. Maybe I am. But I know what I saw, and I need someone—anyone—to tell me I'm not crazy.

My daughter Lily is six. She's in that phase where she draws everything. The dog, her teacher, our house—you name it. The fridge is wallpapered in crayon. I love it. Every stick figure with its wild spaghetti hair makes me smile. That's what dads do. We stick the pictures up and we tell them it's beautiful, and we mean it.

Three weeks ago, Lily handed me a drawing of our house. It was good, for a six-year-old. She got the color right—that faded blue vinyl siding we keep saying we'll replace. She drew the red front door, the two big windows on the first floor, the two on the second floor, and the little round attic vent near the peak.

Except she also drew a window on the second floor that doesn't exist.

I didn't think much of it at first. She's six. Kids add stuff. They put chimneys on ranch houses and give dogs five legs. I stuck it on the fridge with a ladybug magnet and forgot about it.

Then she drew the house again two days later. Same window. Same spot—between our bedroom and the bathroom, on the east-facing wall. In real life, that wall is just drywall on our side and siding on the outside. No window. Never has been one. I checked the original listing photos from when we bought the place in 2019. No window.

I asked her about it.

""Lily, what's this window here?""

She didn't look up from her coloring. ""That's the window where the man watches.""

I want to tell you my blood ran cold or whatever people say in these stories. It didn't. I felt annoyed. I figured one of her friends at school had been telling ghost stories again, or she'd seen something on that damn iPad when we weren't looking. Kids say creepy shit all the time. I have a buddy whose four-year-old told him ""you were nicer in your last life."" Kids are just like that.

""What man, sweetheart?""

""The man who lives in the middle.""

I asked her what ""the middle"" meant. She shrugged the way kids do when they're done talking about something. Went back to giving a dinosaur purple spots. I let it go.

I should not have let it go.



Here's some context about our house. It's a 1987 colonial in a subdivision outside Raleigh. Four bedrooms, two and a half baths, 2,400 square feet. When we moved in, the previous owners had already gutted and redone the kitchen and both bathrooms. Everything else was original—including, presumably, the layout.

The wall Lily keeps drawing the window on sits between our master bedroom and the hall bathroom. On our side, there's a dresser pushed up against it. On the bathroom side, there's the linen closet. I've never given it a second thought in five years of living here.

After the second drawing, I went upstairs and stood in the hallway. I looked at that wall. It's maybe twelve feet long, running from the bathroom door to where it meets the exterior wall. The linen closet takes up about three feet of it. Our dresser is pushed against the bedroom side and covers maybe four feet.

That leaves about five feet of wall that nothing is pushed against on either side.

I knocked on it. I don't know why. I think I expected to feel stupid and move on.

It sounded different.

Our interior walls are standard drywall over studs. You knock on them and you get that hollow thud that everyone knows. This section—the section with nothing on either side of it—didn't thud. It was deeper. Flatter. Like there was more air behind it than there should be.

I told myself it was probably just a difference in insulation. Maybe a duct ran through there. Maybe the stud spacing was wider in that section. Old houses are weird. Ours isn't even that old, but whatever. I rationalized it and moved on.

Then I went outside.

I don't know what made me do it. Some nagging part of my brain, maybe. I walked out the front door, down the driveway, and turned around to look at the east side of the house. I counted windows.

First floor: kitchen window, dining room window. Correct.

Second floor: master bedroom window, bathroom window, guest room window. Correct.

And about five feet of blank siding between the bedroom window and the bathroom window. Just vinyl. No window. No patch. No outline of anything that had ever been a window.

But I stood there staring at it, and I swear to God, the spacing was wrong.

Here's what I mean. On a house like ours, the windows are evenly distributed. They line up with the rooms behind them, and the gaps between them are proportional. But the gap between our bedroom window and the bathroom window was wider than it should have been. Not by a lot. Maybe two feet. But once I saw it, I couldn't unsee it.

Two feet isn't much on a wall. But two feet is enough for something to be between them.



I couldn't sleep that night. I lay there staring at the ceiling while my wife Sarah breathed slow and steady next to me. I kept doing math in my head. Our master bedroom is fourteen feet wide. The bathroom is eight. The hallway is three and a half. That's twenty-five and a half feet of interior space.

I got up, went downstairs, and pulled up the county property records on my laptop. The house footprint showed the second floor as thirty-one feet across on the east-west axis.

I did the math four times. Every time I got the same answer.

There were five and a half unaccounted feet in that wall.

Not two. Not a duct chase. Five and a half feet.

At 2 AM I went back upstairs with a tape measure. I measured the master bedroom wall to wall. Fourteen feet, two inches. I measured the hallway. Three feet, eight inches. I measured the bathroom. Eight feet even. I measured the guest bedroom on the other side. The thickness of interior walls accounted for roughly another ten inches total.

I was off by five feet, four inches. There was a space inside our wall that was five feet wide and I had no idea what was in it.

I pressed my ear against the drywall in the hallway, the section that sounded wrong. I held my breath. The house was dead silent—that 3 AM silence where even the refrigerator feels loud.

I didn't hear anything. I think that's what scared me the most. Because I was *listening* for something, and the silence that came back was the wrong kind. You know how you can hear the difference between an empty room and a room where someone is being very, very quiet?

It was the second kind.



The next morning, I told Sarah. She gave me that look—the one she uses when I'm on my third cup of coffee and spiraling about something I read online at 1 AM.

""Bryan, it's an old house. There's probably a plumbing chase or a mechanical shaft or something. You're going to tear our wall open because Lily drew a window?""

She wasn't wrong. Not entirely. Plumbing chases exist. HVAC shafts exist. But five feet wide? Every chase I've ever seen in a residential build is maybe sixteen to twenty inches. You don't need five feet to run some PVC and copper.

I called my buddy Marcus who does contracting work. He came by that Thursday with a stud finder and an inspection camera—one of those little borescope things you snake through a hole.

We started in the hallway. The stud finder picked up framing at normal sixteen-inch intervals across most of the wall. Then it hit a section where it went haywire. The readings were inconsistent—like there was framing, then open air, then something else, then more framing.

Marcus drilled a small hole in the drywall about four feet up. Quarter inch. Nothing structural. He fed the camera in.

He looked at the screen for maybe five seconds before he pulled back.

""What?"" I said.

He looked at me with an expression I've never seen on his face before. Marcus is a big dude, built like a linebacker, and he's been doing construction for twenty years. He's crawled through attics with rat infestations and gone under crawl spaces that smelled like something died. Nothing fazes him.

He handed me the camera without saying a word.

The screen showed a narrow space—maybe five feet wide, just like I'd calculated. It ran floor to ceiling, rough framing on either side. The camera's LED illuminated raw plywood flooring. No insulation. No pipes. No ductwork. Nothing mechanical at all.

It was just a room. A tall, narrow room sealed inside our wall. No door. No window. No access point that we could see from this angle.

But that's not why Marcus looked like that.

On the far side of the space, pushed up against what would be the exterior wall, there was a chair. A wooden chair, like a kitchen chair. It was facing the interior wall—facing toward our bedroom.

And on the plywood floor around the chair, arranged in a pattern I couldn't immediately make sense of, were dozens of small, dark objects. The camera resolution wasn't great, but I could make out shapes. They looked like little bundles. Little fabric bundles, tied with string.

""Is that—"" I started.

""We need to call someone,"" Marcus said. ""Not me. Someone else. I don't—I'm not going in there, man. I'm sorry. I can't do that.""

I didn't understand his reaction until I tilted the camera up, toward the ceiling of the space.

Scratched into the raw wood of the subfloor above—the underside of our attic floor—were tally marks. Hundreds of them. Organized in neat groups of five, covering almost the entire visible surface.

And below the tally marks, in letters that had been carved slowly, deliberately, with something sharp:

**I CAN HEAR THEM SLEEP**



I called the police. Of course I called the police. Two officers came out, and then a detective, and then more people. They opened the wall from the hallway side—cut through the drywall in a wide rectangle. The smell came first. Not rot. Not decay. It smelled stale. Like air that hadn't moved in a very long time, but also faintly sweet, in a way that made my stomach turn.

The space was exactly what the camera showed. Five feet, four inches wide. Ran the full depth of the house, about twenty-four feet front to back. Floor to ceiling. Framed out with proper studs and joists. This wasn't a gap or an oversight. Someone had built this space on purpose. It was in the original construction.

The chair was a standard wooden kitchen chair, the kind you'd buy at a yard sale for five bucks. It was positioned facing the wall shared with our bedroom. Directly on the other side of that wall was the spot where our bed's headboard sits.

The bundles on the floor were small fabric pouches, hand-stitched from what looked like old cotton. The police collected twenty-six of them. They wouldn't tell me what was inside.

I found out later from a friend at the sheriff's department. Hair. Each pouch contained a small lock of hair, tied with brown thread. Different lengths. Different colors.

Our house has had four owners since it was built in 1987. That's four families. Multiple people in each family. People who slept on the other side of that wall, never knowing.

The tally marks on the ceiling numbered over three thousand.

The detective asked me if I'd ever noticed anything unusual in the house. I said no. Then I stopped. Because that wasn't true.

I'd always wondered why our bedroom door wouldn't stay open. You had to wedge something under it or it would drift shut on its own, slowly, like the house was exhaling. We always assumed the floor was slightly uneven. Old house. Settling.

But I realized now that the floor wasn't uneven. The wall was. Five feet and four inches of hidden space will do that. The weight distribution of our second floor was asymmetric in a way that no one had ever noticed, and it pulled our bedroom door gently closed, every single time, sealing us in.

The police found one more thing that I haven't told Sarah about. On the wall facing our bedroom, at about chest height, someone had made a hole. Not a big one. Maybe the diameter of a pencil. It went clean through the framing, through the drywall, and came out behind our dresser.

I moved the dresser. The hole was there. Clean, round, and angled slightly downward.

Toward our bed.

It had been patched on our side at some point with a tiny circle of matching paint. You would never see it unless you knew where to look. I've been sleeping six feet from that hole for five years.



The police are investigating. They pulled the original building permits and are trying to track down the contractor who built the house in '87. The original owner died in 2004. The second and third owners have been contacted. No one knew about the space.

But here's the thing that keeps me up at night. The thing I keep circling back to.

Those tally marks. Over three thousand. If you assume one mark per night—and the neat, methodical grouping in fives suggests that's exactly how they were counted—that's over eight years of nights.

Our house was built in 1987. The first owners lived there from '87 to '96. Nine years.

The second owners: '96 to 2008. Twelve years.

Third owners: 2008 to 2019. Eleven years.

Us: 2019 to now. Five years.

Three thousand tally marks don't fit inside any single owner's timeline. But they could fit across several.

Which means either someone sealed themselves in that space for eight straight years—no food, no water, no door—or someone has been getting in and out without any of us ever knowing.

I've looked. I've looked everywhere. There's no hatch. No hidden door. No panel. The space is sealed. Framed, drywalled, and sealed on every side. The only opening was the pencil-width hole behind our dresser.

But the chair wasn't dusty. I keep thinking about that. The bundles on the floor were carefully placed. The tally marks were sharp, not faded.

And when they opened the wall, the air that came out was stale, yes. Old, yes.

But it was warm.



We're staying at my in-laws' place. Lily seems fine. She hasn't drawn the house since we left. I asked her one more time about the man who watches from the window.

""He's not there anymore, daddy.""

""How do you know?""

She looked at me like I'd asked the dumbest question in the world.

""Because he left when we did.""

I don't know where we're going to live. I don't know if I'll ever feel safe in a house again. But I keep thinking about those other families—the ones who slept in that bedroom for years, their heads against that wall, while someone sat in a chair on the other side and listened.

Three thousand nights. Someone counted every single one.

And I think about all the houses in our subdivision. Same builder. Same year. Same floor plan.

There are forty-six houses on our street.

I wonder how many of them have a window that isn't there.

1r71opx,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/1r71opx/hotel_breakfast_is_a_relic_of_the_past/,Hotel breakfast is a relic of the past,"Our industry started providing continental breakfast as a free perk to guests in the 70s. Then brands took it and ran with it to full free buffets with hot options and rotating menus. Because at the end of the day it doesn’t cost the brand a dime, it only takes profits from their franchisee slave owners. 

Come to today, if you provide a FREE continental breakfast it is reviewed poor and every guest might have perfect stay but will still give a very low overall score due to a breakfast that was given to them free. The guest doesn’t care it was free but sees it now as a right and not a perk. And when the guests thinks it’s a right it is no longer serving its original purpose. This goes for hot full breakfast offered at the brands also. So many foreign guests come and eat the food then give a low rating because they didn’t get glass plates and silverware. 

The average guest isn’t booking a room when checking in they are getting a room for free and the actual thing they are coming for is eating microwaved eggs and microwaved sausage patties. A hotel is not a restaurant and this industry has backed itself into a corner largely due to the big brands forcing down their franchisee’s throats. 

Our hotel was rated 7.9 on booking when serving breakfast, then we cut breakfast out fully and our scores jumped to 8.9 on booking, 9.6 on exp, and 4.8 on Google. Yes you heard it we cut the FREE PERK and changed nothing in operations and our scores skyrocketed to the highest in the area. Now guests don’t get food or coffee in the lobby in the morning and can go down the street to the breakfast restaurant and pay $15 for two boiled eggs per person. 

I find it so funny the guest complained themselves out of free food and now are happier, and now getting robbed at the restaurants. We are rolling out no breakfast to 3 sister properties in town, our town will have no hotel serving breakfast except for the big brands who are all rated lower than us.

1r71nk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1r71nk6/do_i_know_how_to_compromise/,Do I know how to compromise?,"Hi,

First time posting here and I would love to get others' opinions below.

Been married to my husband for 3 years. When we met, I told him I am not close with my family, he accepted this and told me he is close with his.m Which was fine by me, no issues. I was very happy for him.

My understanding of closeness might be different to others, because I am constantly judged by my husband when I raise something and he tells me how I would know, I am not close with my own family etc.  
Examples; He loves spending time with them. Again, I have no issues, I do spend time with them but I feel like we do spend too much time and when I try to find compromise with my husband we clash.  
We spend 3 weeks in the summer at my in-laws house. I have asked my husband to rent airbnb and he can see them daily. No, he does not like this. From the moment we wake up, to the moment we go to sleep we literally do everything together. Their house is filled with expired food from many years ago, they are hoarders. We don't have a car in their house and we are literary strained in the middle of nowhere with minimal transport.  
In the winter they visit us in our apartment and they stay anywhere between 2 and a half to 3 and a half weeks. I ask him if they can stay in airbnb no, that is not an option.  
When they visit us they are very difficult. They don't shower, wash their clothes and collect junk like empty bottles and they store them in my spare room. Like an empty pack of chips, coffee cups etc. Husband does not say a word to them. He tells me not to throw out their trash for example,which I think he is almost encouraging them to carry on collecting rubbish.

We just spent another 3 weeks with them and went on holiday with them. Before we decided on this holiday, my husband promised we would spend a good amount of time alone, just me and him. Wasn't really the case, whenever i would bring it up we don't have to walk all together to x,y,x place he would get annoyed at me.

MIL is very controlling (I think?) She hates her own husband and was sticking next to my husband whenever we would be together. Like my husband will try to touch me and she would turn and stare at his hand. If we try to have a conversation, she would listen actively and start to ask what is that bla bla. I am pretty sure that she talks about me as well.

The other two sons are not big fans of the parents and barely even see them. MIL talks poorly of the sister in laws, how they are fat, and racist comments. Husband cannot say no to his parents.  
For example, her younger 26 year old son was not picking up her calls and she brought my phone from the kitchen, my husband and her and she told us now we all three need to call him once after another. I find this ridiculous, he is an adult, he is not obvi a fan of them and having to do this is on another level.

For example, I try to compromise with him by going to his own country for three weeks but just to stay in a different house. He says I don't know how to comrise and this is normal, this is how normal families spend time together. He keeps telling me they will die soon and I will never need to see them again. It's impossible to find middle ground with him. Whenever I try to express my feelings, he will listen but then he will circle back to the same thing that his parents will be dead soon.

I don't know what to do. Do you think I don't know how to compromise? Have you been in a similar situation ?",1,1771320977.0,Marriage,3,1.0,False

One was about a guy who was joining a school club, \*any\* school club, on the first day of school. So he just kinda picks one at random. And he would run into this one girl who would maybe be his rival or something, as well as into a fortune teller.

And then each and every episode would restart with him picking a different random school club and then exploring that alternate universe.

As a bonus, I also recalling a sit com anime about a guy working at... I think a coffee shop or ice cream shop.

1r71jaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1r71jaj/limerence_age_gap/,Limerence (age gap),"I was going to use 'discussion' for the flair.   I wasn't sure what to use.   But, I fear being really judged and 'harshly.' 

But, I am posting because I don't have any outlet, well, not much of one.   There's a couple of sites I can at least bring it up but to be honest, I don't think posting here or talking about it will help.   I just don't know what else to do.   Some ppl say to 'talk about it' or 'write about it' so I'm trying that since I don't know what else to do (again).

I am not even sure how to explain or talk about it since I don't want to ramble on and bore ppl.   Anyway, I was interested in a couple of threads or posts.

E.g.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/122flit/limerence\_v\_strong\_crush\_what\_is\_the\_difference/](https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/122flit/limerence_v_strong_crush_what_is_the_difference/)

Is therapy even going to help (me)?

I just don't see how it will/would.

The girl I'm interested in is way younger.   I tell myself, it's not surprising she's not interested.   I asked her out (she accepted coffee but we didn't go out) and since nothing materialized (she didn't make it explicitly clear, the lack of interest or the 'no interest') so it has added to my depression I've had.   I also have a disability that was at least, an initial catalyst or source for my depression.  Now, that is exacerbated or a million times worse.   

I am not interested in dating or meeting someone else even though I can (objectively) find other women attractive and believe they'd be good partners (in general, not just 'for me'), I just don't feel anything.   I am simply not interested and at the same time, I think it's depressing (being alone and resigned to the predicament).   I entered this in AI and the output was actually, positive, 'it's actually a sign of **emotional depth and specificity in your attachment style**.'

Actually, it was positive to an extent since there wasn't sufficient context?   Anyway, I thought it was an intense crush originally but I haven't 'moved on' or stopped thinking about her.   I guess, I can somewhat function although thoughts or feelings about her 'surface' repeatedly and although, I can 'get things done,' it is a bit of a struggle and I find it's really interfering.   

I don't like the term 'LO' - since, I don't perceive her as an 'object' per se but a person and I don't like feeling like this.   I have texted her a couple of times - I did receive a reply but when I 'hinted' my feelings, it wasn't replied to.   I texted recently asking how she was doing (that was it - I thought it was neutral) since I had her phone number.   But, I didn't receive a reply either.  

She's been cordial, friendly and used me for emotional support but that's it.   I don't know what to do and the depression has led to dark thoughts.  I don't want it to be understood that this would be the main reason but for me, it's just information or confirmation that I am hopeless and I really don't have interest in continuing or that life has really become empty since I feel so stupid and I don't have interest in anything else.   

I don't know how to describe or explain it.   I also think that most women (or practically all?) won't be interested in someone who is depressed or feels like this.   It is absolutely my  worst fear or it pains me to think I'd be considered 'a creep' or 'weird' or 'not respecting boundaries.'   That's another reason I want to be 'done.'   I just wanted to be someone who she could rely on (she has been cheated on, mistreated etc.) and despite my 'weirdness' - I thought it was good to be someone who would be reliable.   But, it seems that so many women choose guys who are not good for them and not loyal.   Well, that's my perception.   

I wanted to say more but I am afraid I'm rambling on at this point?   I know, if I am more specific, I will probably be judged, if not here then on other subs or from other ppl who don't care about someone's feelings or whatever.   She is around 23 or so and I'm much older.    I have a disability but I try to go to the gym when I can and I was trying to 'live my life' and improve myself but nothing helps.    I will probably be told to get over it and 'find someone your own age' or something similar but nothing helps.   Thanks for reading.   ",2,1771320532.0,limerence,3,1.0,False
1r71izx,https://i.redd.it/01zpv097x0kg1.jpeg,How to trick your brain into doing difficult things,"Picture this: it’s 6 AM, your alarm goes off, and you know you should get up and go to the gym. But your bed feels like the most comfortable place on Earth.

Your brain starts negotiating:

* “Five more minutes.”
* “Actually… I’ll work out tomorrow.”
* “I’m tired today anyway.”

Sounds familiar right?  
You’re not broken. You’re not lazy. You’re not lacking willpower.

Your brain is simply doing what it evolved to do: avoid discomfort and conserve energy.

**Why your brain fights you**

Before we get into solutions, it helps to understand what you’re actually fighting. Your brain creates resistance in two predictable ways, and recognising these patterns is the first step to beating them.

**Resistance type 1: Emotional pushback**

Your brain isn’t judging tasks logically - it’s judging them emotionally. 

Here’s the key insight:  
The bigger a task looks, the stronger the emotional resistance your brain creates.

Examples:

* “I need to clean the entire house” → major resistance
* “I’ll just wash one dish” → manageable
* “I have to study for eight hours” → dread
* “I’ll review one page” → doable
* “I need to lose 30 pounds” → impossible
* “I’ll do five pushups” → achievable

Your brain is constantly doing quick, subconscious math.  
Big task = big emotions.  
Small task = small emotions.

**Resistance type 2: Ego protection**

The second kind of resistance comes from your self-image, the story you tell yourself about who you are.

Your brain’s main priority? Protect that story at all costs.

How it shows up:

* If you believe “I’m smart” → you avoid anything where you might look clueless.
* If you believe “I’m not a math person” → you feel resistance before you even openthe book.
* If you believe “I’m not athletic” → the gym feels threatening, so your brain pushes you away.
* If you believe “I’m a perfectionist” → starting becomes terrifying because the first attempt won’t be perfect.

In other words:  
The resistance isn’t about the task, it’s about protecting your ego.

**The practical solutions that actually work**

These are simple, low-effort techniques that work with your brain instead of against it.

**Strategy 1: The 2 minute trick**

Your brain resists big commitments. So don’t make any.

Commit to two minutes. Nothing more.

* Instead of “work out,” do one exercise.
* Instead of “study,” read one paragraph.
* Instead of “write the chapter,” write one sentence.
* Instead of “clean the room,” pick up three items.

Once you start, you’ll probably keep going.  
But even if you don’t, you’ve beaten the resistance.

**Strategy 2: Preparation**

If two minutes feels like too much, don’t start the task, start the setup.

* Put on gym clothes
* Fill your water bottle
* Open the laptop
* Lay out your books
* Clear your desk
* Open the document
* Read the last sentence you wrote

Physical movement bypasses emotional resistance.  
By the time you’re prepped, momentum is already working for you.

**Strategy 3: Reward yourself**

Your brain loves rewards, hates effort. So sandwich the effort between incentives:

Small reward → Hard task → Bigger reward

Examples:

* Morning: Coffee → Work task → Your favorite lunch
* Evening: One YouTube video → Study → Netflix episode
* Weekend: Sleep in → Clean the apartment → Meet friends

Make the second reward conditional. Your brain will chase it.

**Strategy 4: Make it fun**

Pair something enjoyable with the task itself.

* Listen to your favorite podcast during cardio
* Drink your nicest coffee while doing deep work
* Use your comfiest chair only for studying
* Light your favourite candle when writing
* Play specific music while cleaning

Your brain starts associating the difficult task with a pleasant experience, lowering resistance automatically.

**Strategy 5: Tell yourself you’re experimenting**

When failure feels dangerous, shift from performance to experimentation.  
Experiments don’t need to be perfect, they just need data.

* Instead of: “I have to give a perfect presentation.” Try: “I’m going to experiment with getting more people to engage.”
* Instead of: “I need to impress everyone at the gym.” Try: “I’ll run a quick experiment: can I add 1 pound to last week’s lift?”
* Instead of: “I must write a perfect draft.” Try: “I’m experimenting with writing fast, messy ideas for 10 minutes.”

Experiments don’t threaten your ego, they create curiosity instead of pressure.

**Strategy 6: Pretend to be someone you’re not (yet)**

Don’t try to achieve something. Become someone.

Creates resistance:

* “I need to get in shape.”
* “I should eat healthy.”
* “I have to study more.”
* “I need to be organized.”

Removes resistance:

* “I’m someone who works out.”
* “I nourish my body.”
* “I’m a student.”
* “I’m an organized person.”

Your brain resists tasks that contradict your identity.  
It cooperates with tasks that match it.

**Strategy 7: Be a beginner**

Protect your ego by embracing beginnerhood.

Say:

* “I’m learning Spanish” (not “I’m bad at it”).
* “I’m new to weightlifting” (not “I’m weak”).
* “I’m practicing cooking” (not “I can’t cook”).
* “I’m developing my writing” (not “I’m not a writer”).

You can’t fail at being a beginner.  
You can only improve.

**The bottom line is:**

Your brain is always going to send you dramatic messages:

“Too hard.”  
“Too much.”  
“Not today.”

But half of that is just your brain being… dramatic.

Tomorrow morning, don’t try to win the day, just win the first two minutes.

(p.s. I am almost 18 do not fret) 

For the past few days we've been chatting and he has been occasionally flirty but overall most of our conversations were enjoyable and I was having fun. All was going well until I sent a streak yesterday of myself studying in a cafe. That's when he suggested to pull up. I've personally never met up with a guy before, and I don't plan on it (at least not so soon). That's why I told him straight up not to come. We went back & forth for a bit with me being stern with my no's, then I switched to a joking tone after I figured he got the hint (I never said yes).  I continued my studies and forgot about the situation, and an hour later he texts me saying he can see me and describing my movements/seating. I get creeped out and leave, later come back as he's leaving, and text him telling him that his actions scared me. 

He was struggling to grasp why I was upset as he never approached me or spoke to me, simply brought a coffee just like everyone else. I try to explain to him that it's not the same since he was there to see me as well, but he doesn't understand and insists that he would've never done anything to make me uncomfortable. I then turn harsh and when he asks me what bothered me, I reply ""Your presence.""

This is when he got visibly upset and now refuses to talk to me. I think I may have been too harsh and spoke out of anxiety rather than truth, which is where I recognize I may have been the AH.

Your brain is simply doing what it evolved to do: avoid discomfort and conserve energy.

**Why your brain fights you**

Before we get into solutions, it helps to understand what you’re actually fighting. Your brain creates resistance in two predictable ways, and recognising these patterns is the first step to beating them.

**Resistance type 1: Emotional pushback**

Your brain isn’t judging tasks logically - it’s judging them emotionally. 

Here’s the key insight:  
The bigger a task looks, the stronger the emotional resistance your brain creates.

Examples:

* “I need to clean the entire house” → major resistance
* “I’ll just wash one dish” → manageable
* “I have to study for eight hours” → dread
* “I’ll review one page” → doable
* “I need to lose 30 pounds” → impossible
* “I’ll do five pushups” → achievable

Your brain is constantly doing quick, subconscious math.  
Big task = big emotions.  
Small task = small emotions.

**Resistance type 2: Ego protection**

The second kind of resistance comes from your self-image, the story you tell yourself about who you are.

Your brain’s main priority? Protect that story at all costs.

How it shows up:

* If you believe “I’m smart” → you avoid anything where you might look clueless.
* If you believe “I’m not a math person” → you feel resistance before you even openthe book.
* If you believe “I’m not athletic” → the gym feels threatening, so your brain pushes you away.
* If you believe “I’m a perfectionist” → starting becomes terrifying because the first attempt won’t be perfect.

In other words:  
The resistance isn’t about the task, it’s about protecting your ego.

**The practical solutions that actually work**

These are simple, low-effort techniques that work with your brain instead of against it.

**Strategy 1: The 2 minute trick**

Your brain resists big commitments. So don’t make any.

Commit to two minutes. Nothing more.

* Instead of “work out,” do one exercise.
* Instead of “study,” read one paragraph.
* Instead of “write the chapter,” write one sentence.
* Instead of “clean the room,” pick up three items.

Once you start, you’ll probably keep going.  
But even if you don’t, you’ve beaten the resistance.

**Strategy 2: Preparation**

If two minutes feels like too much, don’t start the task, start the setup.

* Put on gym clothes
* Fill your water bottle
* Open the laptop
* Lay out your books
* Clear your desk
* Open the document
* Read the last sentence you wrote

Physical movement bypasses emotional resistance.  
By the time you’re prepped, momentum is already working for you. 

**Strategy 3: Reward yourself**

Your brain loves rewards, hates effort. So sandwich the effort between incentives:

Small reward → Hard task → Bigger reward

Examples:

* Morning: Coffee → Work task → Your favorite lunch
* Evening: One YouTube video → Study → Netflix episode
* Weekend: Sleep in → Clean the apartment → Meet friends

Make the second reward conditional. Your brain will chase it.

**Strategy 4: Make it fun**

Pair something enjoyable with the task itself.

* Listen to your favorite podcast during cardio
* Drink your nicest coffee while doing deep work
* Use your comfiest chair only for studying
* Light your favourite candle when writing
* Play specific music while cleaning

Your brain starts associating the difficult task with a pleasant experience, lowering resistance automatically.

**Strategy 5: Tell yourself you’re experimenting**

When failure feels dangerous, shift from performance to experimentation.  
Experiments don’t need to be perfect, they just need data.

* Instead of: “I have to give a perfect presentation.” Try: “I’m going to experiment with getting more people to engage.”
* Instead of: “I need to impress everyone at the gym.” Try: “I’ll run a quick experiment: can I add 1 pound to last week’s lift?”
* Instead of: “I must write a perfect draft.” Try: “I’m experimenting with writing fast, messy ideas for 10 minutes.”

Experiments don’t threaten your ego, they create curiosity instead of pressure.

**Strategy 6: Pretend to be someone you’re not (yet)**

Don’t try to achieve something. Become someone.

Creates resistance:

* “I need to get in shape.”
* “I should eat healthy.”
* “I have to study more.”
* “I need to be organized.”

Removes resistance:

* “I’m someone who works out.”
* “I nourish my body.”
* “I’m a student.”
* “I’m an organized person.”

Your brain resists tasks that contradict your identity.  
It cooperates with tasks that match it.

**Strategy 7: Be a beginner**

Protect your ego by embracing beginnerhood.

Say:

* “I’m learning Spanish” (not “I’m bad at it”).
* “I’m new to weightlifting” (not “I’m weak”).
* “I’m practicing cooking” (not “I can’t cook”).
* “I’m developing my writing” (not “I’m not a writer”).

You can’t fail at being a beginner.  
You can only improve.

**The bottom line is:**

Your brain is always going to send you dramatic messages:

“Too hard.”  
“Too much.”  
“Not today.”

But half of that is just your brain being… dramatic. 

Tomorrow morning, don’t try to win the day, just win the first two minutes.

1r71hby,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1r71hby/how_to_actually_flirt_without_being_creepy_the/,How to Actually FLIRT Without Being Creepy: The Psychology Your Dad Never Taught You,"look, most guys in their 20s flirt like they're trying to defuse a bomb. awkward pauses, weird compliments, zero idea when she's into it or just being polite.

i've been there. spent way too long thinking charisma was something you're born with, not something you can learn. turns out that's complete BS. after going down a rabbit hole of research (books, psychology studies, even some cringey pickup artist stuff just to see what NOT to do), i realized flirting isn't about lines or tricks. it's about understanding human psychology, reading social cues, and actually being interesting.

here's what actually works:

**1. learn how attraction actually functions in the brain**

most guys treat flirting like a transaction. say the right thing, get the number, done. but attraction doesn't work like that. it's biological, psychological, and weirdly predictable once you understand the patterns.

read ""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer, former FBI special agent. this dude literally interrogated terrorists for a living and figured out how to make anyone like him. won multiple awards for his behavioral analysis work. the book breaks down friendship and attraction signals that your brain processes subconsciously. stuff like proximity, frequency, duration, intensity. sounds technical but it's insanely practical.

the chapter on nonverbal communication will make you question everything you think you know about body language. you'll start noticing things you've been blind to your entire life. best book on human behavior i've ever read, hands down.

**2. stop trying to impress, start getting curious**

biggest mistake guys make is turning conversations into personal resumes. she doesn't care that you deadlift 315 or that your startup just got seed funding.

""How to Talk to Anyone"" by Leil Lowndes teaches 92 specific techniques for conversations. she's a communications expert who's coached executives and celebrities. the ""big baby pivot"" technique alone changed how i approach strangers. instead of interview mode (where are you from, what do you do), you learn to find genuine connection points.

the section on making people feel like they're the most interesting person in the room is gold. this isn't manipulation, it's about actual curiosity. when you're genuinely interested in someone, they feel it. and that's magnetic.

**3. fix your insecurity first, then worry about technique**

you can learn every conversation hack in the world, but if you reek of insecurity, none of it matters. women can smell desperation from across the room.

""Models: Attract Women Through Honesty"" by Mark Manson (yes, the guy who wrote The Subtle Art). this is the anti pickup artist book. his whole premise is that neediness kills attraction and vulnerability creates it. he breaks down the difference between demographic interests (your job, hobbies) and narcissistic interests (being right, being impressive) versus relational interests (connecting, understanding).

read this before you touch any other dating advice. it'll save you from becoming that guy who memorizes openers and wonders why nothing works. the chapter on polarization (being honest about who you are so you repel wrong matches and attract right ones) is uncomfortable but necessary.

**4. understand the actual game being played**

here's the thing nobody tells you: flirting is collaborative improvisation, not a conquest. you're not trying to ""get"" her, you're creating a vibe together where both people feel excited.

check out [""The Definitive Book of Body Language"" by Allan and Barbara Pease](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/262731.The_Definitive_Book_of_Body_Language). they've studied nonverbal communication for decades across different cultures. the section on courtship signals is fascinating. you'll learn the 13 ways women signal interest (most guys miss like 10 of them) and the stupid things men do that kill attraction instantly.

this book will teach you to read the room. you'll know within 30 seconds if she's open to conversation or wants to be left alone. saves everyone time and awkwardness.

**5. practice in low stakes environments**

reading is useless without application. start conversations everywhere. coffee shops, grocery stores, dog parks. not to hit on people, just to get comfortable talking to strangers.

if you want something more structured that pulls all this together, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), a learning app built by Columbia grads and Google AI folks. you tell it what you're working on, like ""become more confident with women as an introvert,"" and it creates a personalized learning plan pulling from dating psychology books, relationship experts, and actual research.

what makes it useful is the adjustable depth. start with a 10-minute overview while commuting, then switch to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples when something clicks. the voice options are weirdly addictive too, there's even a smoky, sarcastic narrator that makes dense psychology way more digestible. it basically takes all the books mentioned here plus expert talks and turns them into audio you can absorb during your commute or at the gym.

**6. remember women are humans, not slot machines**

this should be obvious but apparently isn't. she's not a puzzle to solve or a challenge to overcome. she's a person with her own goals, fears, sense of humor, and standards.

[""Attached"" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9547888-attached) explores attachment theory in relationships. sounds academic but it's incredibly readable. helps you understand why you're attracted to certain people and why some dynamics feel easy while others feel like constant work.

the book explains anxious, avoidant, and secure attachment styles. once you understand your own style and can recognize others', dating becomes way less confusing. you'll stop chasing people who are fundamentally incompatible and start noticing the ones who actually want what you want.

the science here is legit. this isn't pop psychology, it's based on decades of research. changed how i view every relationship in my life.

**final thoughts**

look, you're gonna be awkward sometimes. you'll misread signals, say dumb things, get rejected. that's just part of being human. but understanding the psychology behind attraction, learning to read nonverbal cues, and fixing your own insecurity issues will put you miles ahead of most guys.

flirting should be fun. playful. if it feels like work, you're doing it wrong or talking to the wrong person.

these books won't turn you into some smooth operator overnight. but they'll teach you the fundamentals that actually matter. the rest is just practice and being willing to look stupid occasionally.

He told me the campaign had slight horror elements, but would be mainly about mystery and case-solving. 

(He mentioned that he expected me to be an Asian woman (because I studied Japanese at the time and have a name that could be interpreted as Asian as well, and said he was a bit disappointed that this was not the case.))

His descriptions were so graphic and torturous that I left the campaign immediately. Went out of the door, gut wrenched.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

i’m actually staring at my phone screen right now and i feel like i’m about to black out. like my vision is literally going blurry and i’m shaking so hard i can barely type this. i want to scream until my lungs give out. i’ve been planning this for two years. two years of working double shifts, skipping meals, not buying a single thing for myself, just so i could finally get out of this hellhole. i’m 19. i was supposed to leave for my study abroad program in literally 10 days. 1.5 weeks. i already have my bags packed. And payed for my tuition. i have a side job lined up at a cafe over there so i could actually survive while studying. this was my exit. my one chance to finally breathe and not have to look over my shoulder every time i hear a door open.

and now it’s gone. all of it. i checked my banking app this morning to send the deposit for my student housing the final step and my balance was $12.

twelve. dollars. there was over $1,000 in there 3 days ago. i thought because i turned 18 last year that the account was private, but apparently because my ""dad"" helped me open it when i was 16, he still had access to it. i went downstairs and he’s passed out on the couch smelling like a literal brewery and god knows what else. he spent my entire future on a three day bender. a thousand dollars of my blood and sweat gone in 48 hours so he could stay high for a weekend. and my mom i went to her crying, literally begging her to help me or tell me he’d pay it back and she just looked at me with that pathetic, tired face and told me to ""stop being so dramatic"" and that ""your father is sick, he didn’t mean to do it, he was just in a bad place.”

sick? HE STOLE FROM HIS SON. he knew that money was for my housing. he knew if i didn’t pay it by friday i’d lose my spot in the program and the job i had waiting for me. he literally sabotaged my entire life and she’s standing there in the kitchen making him coffee like he didn’t just commit a crime. she’s an enabler. she always has been. she’d rather see me rot in this house with them than admit her husband is a thief and a loser. i have no one to ask. no grandparents, no aunts, no friends who have that kind of money to just loan a 19 year old.i’m completely stuck. i worked so hard. i did everything right. i stayed out of trouble, i got the grades, i saved every penny, and it didn't even matter.

i'm sitting in my room looking at my suitcase and i’ve never felt this much hate in my life. i hate him. i hate her for letting him do it. i hate that i’m 19 and my life is already over before it even started because i happened to be born into this family.

i have to email the program and tell them i can't come. i have to tell the cafe manager i'm not coming. i have to stay here in this room hearing him stumble around and hearing her make excuses for him while i try to figure out how to even get 5 dollars for lunch. i feel like i'm suffocating. i actually can’t do this anymore.

PTSD for Three Years. Plot Twist: It Was All Cap

My hero cop husband got t0rtured for a month saving some hostage girl.

When he got out? Covered in scars. Couldn’t even perform in bed.

“It’s trauma. Don’t push him.” Doctor’s orders.

So I played the perfect wife for three years.

Drained every penny on his treatments.

Worked two jobs to pay for that poor girl’s tuition.

Slept on the couch for just because “the se//x triggered his PTSD.”

Until at his award ceremony, someone played the wrong video.

There’s my “broken” husband—

Bending that girl over a desk, going at it like a animal.

“You like that? Say my name. Beg for it.”

“Good girl. Take it all.”

Grunting. Moaning. Zero problems performing.

He lunged to cover my eyes.

“Baby don’t look! I had to make that mafia boss trust me!”

“He was watching! It was just part of the mission!”

“Tech team!”

“Who played that video! Shut it off NOW!”

Captain Marcus Webb’s shout exploded across the auditorium.

The blinding light vanished from the screen, and the whole hall went dark and silent.

I sat frozen with ice-cold hands.

The hand covering my eyes smelled like his cigars—familiar.

But that same hand was just gripping another girl’s hair on that screen seconds ago.

“Evelyn. Don’t look.”

Grayson’s voice stayed steady in my ear, but something was tight underneath.

I didn’t move or speak.

My fingers twisted my dress into a hard knot—my nervous habit.

The lights slammed back on and everyone’s eyes locked onto me like spotlights.

Pity. Curiosity. Disgust. Schadenfreude.

Grayson dropped his hand and pulled off his uniform jacket to drape over my trembling shoulders.

“Just a misunderstanding. Special interrogation tactic.”

He said it loud enough for everyone to hear, calm as ever.

“Please continue. Don’t let this ruin the ceremony.”

Like that se//x footage wasn’t just broadcast to the entire department.

Captain Webb rushed over with guilt written all over his face.

“Evelyn, you okay? Those tech idi0ts screwed up. I’ll deal with them.”

He looked at me like a worried father.

For three years the whole department knew about Grayson’s condition.

They knew I quit my job to care for him.

To them I was the saint, the selfless cop’s wife.

Now I was the punchline.

“I’m fine, Captain.”

Grayson’s arm locked around my shoulders, heavy and possessive.

“I’m taking her home.”

He didn’t give anyone a chance to ask questions and walked us straight out.

Cold air hit me in the corridor and I shivered.

In the car, he finally let go.

His scent—sweat and something wild—made my stomach turn.

I stared out the window.

“That was fake.” He started the engine.

“What was fake?”

“The video. I was playing a role to gain the dealer’s trust.”

His explanation came out smooth and flawless.

“That girl Aria was in deep. I had to use special tactics or she wouldn’t talk. I thought that footage was destroyed.”

He glanced at me while driving.

“I know this is hard, but it was my job. You need to understand.”

Understand.

That word again.

For three years I understood his trauma, his condition, every fragile piece of him.

But I can’t understand how he could screw another woman on a desk, when touching me felt like t0rture to him.

The car stopped outside our building.

I didn’t move.

Grayson unbuckled and leaned closer, his face right there with those exhausted eyes.

“Stop being upset, okay?” His voice went soft and coaxing.

“Aria’s waiting upstairs. She’s scared after today.”

Ice water dumped over my head.

I whipped around and stared at him.

“Why is she in our house?”

Grayson’s face darkened and irritation flashed in his eyes.

“She’s scared living alone. Moved in a few days ago.”

“I thought I told you.”

He said it like it was obvious, like this wasn’t my home, but some motel he could let anyone crash in.

I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms.

He never told me. He never said a word.

I shoved the car door open and stumbled toward the building.

It took me several tries to get the key in the lock.

The door swung open and a wave of unfamiliar perfume hit me in the face.

By the entrance sat a pair of pink heels that weren’t mine.

A woman’s jacket was tossed on the couch.

Half-eaten snacks and a fashion magazine covered the coffee table.

Everything screamed that another woman lived here now.

Aria walked out of the master bedroom wearing my silk nightgown.

The one I bought for my birthday and never had the heart to wear.

Now it hung loose on her thin frame with the neckline gaping open, showing off a trail of red marks.

“Grayson! Evelyn! You’re back!”

She froze like a startled rabbit, clutching the collar.

“I’m so sorry, Evelyn. Your nightgown…”

“All my clothes are in the wash. Grayson said I could borrow yours.”

She looked at me with those teary puppy eyes, like I was the villain invading her space.

Grayson walked in, casually taking the glass from her hand and drinking.

“Scared, huh? It’s okay now.”

He ruffled her hair—tender, natural, intimate.

That kind of tenderness—I’d only seen it when he first came back from the mission at his most broken.

“I’ll make dinner.”

I threw out the words and bolted into the kitchen.

Cold water ran over my hands, but I felt nothing.

My body bu//rned from the inside out like lit cotton.

I could hear them talking in low voices.

“Grayson, is Evelyn mad? This is all my fault—” Aria’s voice cracked.

“Don’t overthink it. She just needs time.” Grayson’s voice was low.

“You had a rough day. Go rest.”

“But I’m scared. Every time I close my eyes I see that footage…”

“Then I’ll stay with you for a bit.”

The door clicked shut.

I turned off the faucet and leaned against the cold counter, shaking all over.

So he wasn’t broken.

He just didn’t work for me.

I made dinner—three dishes and soup, all his favorites.

At the table I didn’t serve him like I usually did.

The silence was suffocating.

Aria kept her head down, eating in tiny b!tes, her eyes red-rimmed.

Grayson barely touched his food before pushing his plate away.

“I’m full.”

He stood up and pulled a thick stack of bills from his wallet, dropping it on the table.

“This month’s living expenses. Let me know if it’s not enough.”

I stared at the crisp bills and felt a sharp sting.

When did we become this?

“Is that where Aria’s tuition and rent money comes from too?”

The question slipped out before I could stop it.

Grayson froze and turned to look at me with cold eyes.

“She’s a girl with no one. Helping her is only right.”

“Evelyn, I didn’t think you were this petty.”

Petty?

I drained our savings for his so-called condition.

I sold my mother’s jewelry to pay for his poor girl’s education.

And all I got was called petty.

“Yeah. I’m petty.”

I lifted my head and met his gaze.

“Grayson. Tell her to move out.”

“This is OUR home.”

Aria’s fork clattered to the floor. She flinched and tears streamed down her face.

Grayson’s expression darkened completely.

He didn’t look at me.

Instead, he walked over to Aria, shielding her behind him as if facing a vicious enemy.

“Evelyn Hart, are you done yet?”

I watched him shield another woman and laughed, but tears streamed down my face anyway.

“Grayson, who’s really causing a scene here?”

“For three years I’ve lived like a ghost because of you.”

“I don’t dare speak loudly. I don’t dare sleep with the lights on. I’m terrified of disturbing your fragile nerves.”

“I made you my entire world, but what about you?”

“You screw other women, then come home and tell me it was for work!”

“How am I supposed to believe you?”

“How am I supposed to understand?”

My voice got louder until I was practically screaming.

Three years of hurt and humiliation finally exploded.

Aria trembled behind him, crying.

“Evelyn, please don’t blame Grayson, this is all my fault, if he hadn’t saved me he wouldn’t—”

“Shut up!”

Grayson suddenly growled, cutting her off.

His eyes were ice cold.

“Evelyn, you think I’m lying to you?”

I bit my lip and said nothing, but the distrust in my eyes said everything.

He suddenly laughed, bitter and exhausted.

“Fine. Since you don’t believe me, I’ll show you proof.”

He pulled out his phone, tapped the screen a few times, then tossed it in front of me.

On the screen was a hospital diagnosis report.

Severe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder with accompanying sexual dysfunction.

Black and white. Clinical. Brutal.

Below it were video files of Dr. Sullivan’s hypnotherapy sessions.

In the videos he looked like a helpless kid curled up on the couch, drenched in sweat, mumbling things I couldn’t understand.

This was Grayson at his most broken—a side I’d never seen.

“See that?”

“The doctor said my trauma stems from that month of t0rture. I have an instinctive fear and resistance to all physical intimacy.”

“Aria’s the exception.”

He paused, as if searching for the right words.

“The doctor thinks it’s because she went through the same he11 I did. My subconscious sees her as safe, so my defenses drop.”

“It’s a pathological response. Not betrayal.”

His explanation was airtight, almost scientifically sound.

So I wasn’t his exception.

“So I’m the problem. Is that it?”

The words slipped out in a whisper.

Grayson looked caught off guard. He stepped toward me like he wanted to hold me, but I je//rked back.

His hand hung in the air, his expression unreadable.

“Evelyn, it’s not like that.”

“I love you. I just want us to have a normal life.”

“Give me some time, okay? I’ll fix this. I’ll fix myself.”

His voice went soft, almost pleading.

I felt like I was losing my mind.

That night, Grayson didn’t sleep alone for the first time in three years.

He lay beside me, his body rigid and tense—but our hearts were miles apart.

The next morning I woke up and Grayson was already gone.

I numbly threw some clothes into a suitcase.

I needed to leave—get some space, calm down.

I texted Grayson saying I’d stay at my mom’s for a few days.

He didn’t reply.

Dragging my suitcase downstairs, I saw Grayson’s car parked not far from the gate.

He hadn’t left.

Something twisted in my ch//est.

I pulled my suitcase toward the car step by step.

The window rolled down, but it wasn’t Grayson’s face staring back at me.

It was Captain Webb.

“Evelyn, where are you going?”

His expression was serious.

“I… I’m staying at my mom’s for a few days.”

Captain Webb sighed and opened the passenger door.

“Get in. We need to talk.”

The car didn’t head toward my parents’ place.

Instead, he drove in circles through the city’s most congested streets.

“That kid Grayson—stubborn as he11, terrible temper.”

“I know you’re hurting, but you also know what he’s been through these past three years.”

“That month wasn’t something a human being should endure.”

“If it were me, I would’ve lost my mind.”

I’d heard this speech a thousand times.

“I know.”

“You don’t just know. You’ve been incredible.”

Captain Webb glanced at me in the rearview mirror.

“Everyone at the station says Grayson must’ve saved a country in his past life to end up with a wife like you.”

“But Evelyn, sometimes being good isn’t enough to fix things.”

My heart tightened.

“Captain… do you know something?”

Captain Webb went quiet for a long time—so long I thought he wouldn’t answer.

He pulled over by the river and lit a cigar, taking a deep drag.

“About Aria. What Grayson told you wasn’t the whole truth.”

My stomach lurched.

I never expected that what he said next would drag me straight into the he11.",2,1771319735.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

He glanced at me while driving.

“I know this is hard, but it was my job. You need to understand.”

Understand.

That word again.

For three years I understood his trauma, his condition, every fragile piece of him.

But I can’t understand how he could screw another woman on a desk, when touching me felt like t0rture to him.

The car stopped outside our building.

I didn’t move.

Grayson unbuckled and leaned closer, his face right there with those exhausted eyes.

“Stop being upset, okay?” His voice went soft and coaxing.

“Aria’s waiting upstairs. She’s scared after today.”

Ice water dumped over my head.

I whipped around and stared at him.

“Why is she in our house?”

Grayson’s face darkened and irritation flashed in his eyes.

“She’s scared living alone. Moved in a few days ago.”

“I thought I told you.”

He said it like it was obvious, like this wasn’t my home, but some motel he could let anyone crash in.

I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms.

He never told me. He never said a word.

I shoved the car door open and stumbled toward the building.

It took me several tries to get the key in the lock.

The door swung open and a wave of unfamiliar perfume hit me in the face.

By the entrance sat a pair of pink heels that weren’t mine.

A woman’s jacket was tossed on the couch.

Half-eaten snacks and a fashion magazine covered the coffee table.

Everything screamed that another woman lived here now.

Aria walked out of the master bedroom wearing my silk nightgown.

The one I bought for my birthday and never had the heart to wear.

Now it hung loose on her thin frame with the neckline gaping open, showing off a trail of red marks.

“Grayson! Evelyn! You’re back!”

She froze like a startled rabbit, clutching the collar.

“I’m so sorry, Evelyn. Your nightgown…”

“All my clothes are in the wash. Grayson said I could borrow yours.”

She looked at me with those teary puppy eyes, like I was the villain invading her space.

Grayson walked in, casually taking the glass from her hand and drinking.

“Scared, huh? It’s okay now.”

He ruffled her hair—tender, natural, intimate.

That kind of tenderness—I’d only seen it when he first came back from the mission at his most broken.

“I’ll make dinner.”

I threw out the words and bolted into the kitchen.

Cold water ran over my hands, but I felt nothing.

My body bu//rned from the inside out like lit cotton.

I could hear them talking in low voices.

“Grayson, is Evelyn mad? This is all my fault—” Aria’s voice cracked.

“Don’t overthink it. She just needs time.” Grayson’s voice was low.

“You had a rough day. Go rest.”

“But I’m scared. Every time I close my eyes I see that footage…”

“Then I’ll stay with you for a bit.”

The door clicked shut.

I turned off the faucet and leaned against the cold counter, shaking all over.

So he wasn’t broken.

He just didn’t work for me.

I made dinner—three dishes and soup, all his favorites.

At the table I didn’t serve him like I usually did.

The silence was suffocating.

Aria kept her head down, eating in tiny b!tes, her eyes red-rimmed.

Grayson barely touched his food before pushing his plate away.

“I’m full.”

He stood up and pulled a thick stack of bills from his wallet, dropping it on the table.

“This month’s living expenses. Let me know if it’s not enough.”

I stared at the crisp bills and felt a sharp sting.

When did we become this?

“Is that where Aria’s tuition and rent money comes from too?”

The question slipped out before I could stop it.

Grayson froze and turned to look at me with cold eyes.

“She’s a girl with no one. Helping her is only right.”

“Evelyn, I didn’t think you were this petty.”

Petty?

I drained our savings for his so-called condition.

I sold my mother’s jewelry to pay for his poor girl’s education.

And all I got was called petty.

“Yeah. I’m petty.”

I lifted my head and met his gaze.

“Grayson. Tell her to move out.”

“This is OUR home.”

Aria’s fork clattered to the floor. She flinched and tears streamed down her face.

Grayson’s expression darkened completely.

He didn’t look at me.

Instead, he walked over to Aria, shielding her behind him as if facing a vicious enemy.

“Evelyn Hart, are you done yet?”

I watched him shield another woman and laughed, but tears streamed down my face anyway.

“Grayson, who’s really causing a scene here?”

“For three years I’ve lived like a ghost because of you.”

“I don’t dare speak loudly. I don’t dare sleep with the lights on. I’m terrified of disturbing your fragile nerves.”

“I made you my entire world, but what about you?”

“You screw other women, then come home and tell me it was for work!”

“How am I supposed to believe you?”

“How am I supposed to understand?”

My voice got louder until I was practically screaming.

Three years of hurt and humiliation finally exploded.

Aria trembled behind him, crying.

“Evelyn, please don’t blame Grayson, this is all my fault, if he hadn’t saved me he wouldn’t—”

“Shut up!”

Grayson suddenly growled, cutting her off.

His eyes were ice cold.

“Evelyn, you think I’m lying to you?”

I bit my lip and said nothing, but the distrust in my eyes said everything.

He suddenly laughed, bitter and exhausted.

“Fine. Since you don’t believe me, I’ll show you proof.”

He pulled out his phone, tapped the screen a few times, then tossed it in front of me.

On the screen was a hospital diagnosis report.

Severe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder with accompanying sexual dysfunction.

Black and white. Clinical. Brutal.

Below it were video files of Dr. Sullivan’s hypnotherapy sessions.

In the videos he looked like a helpless kid curled up on the couch, drenched in sweat, mumbling things I couldn’t understand.

This was Grayson at his most broken—a side I’d never seen.

“See that?”

“The doctor said my trauma stems from that month of t0rture. I have an instinctive fear and resistance to all physical intimacy.”

“Aria’s the exception.”

He paused, as if searching for the right words.

“The doctor thinks it’s because she went through the same he11 I did. My subconscious sees her as safe, so my defenses drop.”

“It’s a pathological response. Not betrayal.”

His explanation was airtight, almost scientifically sound.

So I wasn’t his exception.

“So I’m the problem. Is that it?”

The words slipped out in a whisper.

Grayson looked caught off guard. He stepped toward me like he wanted to hold me, but I je//rked back.

His hand hung in the air, his expression unreadable.

“Evelyn, it’s not like that.”

“I love you. I just want us to have a normal life.”

“Give me some time, okay? I’ll fix this. I’ll fix myself.”

His voice went soft, almost pleading.

I felt like I was losing my mind.

That night, Grayson didn’t sleep alone for the first time in three years.

He lay beside me, his body rigid and tense—but our hearts were miles apart.

The next morning I woke up and Grayson was already gone.

I numbly threw some clothes into a suitcase.

I needed to leave—get some space, calm down.

I texted Grayson saying I’d stay at my mom’s for a few days.

He didn’t reply.

Dragging my suitcase downstairs, I saw Grayson’s car parked not far from the gate.

He hadn’t left.

Something twisted in my ch//est.

I pulled my suitcase toward the car step by step.

The window rolled down, but it wasn’t Grayson’s face staring back at me.

It was Captain Webb.

“Evelyn, where are you going?”

His expression was serious.

“I… I’m staying at my mom’s for a few days.”

Captain Webb sighed and opened the passenger door.

“Get in. We need to talk.”

The car didn’t head toward my parents’ place.

Instead, he drove in circles through the city’s most congested streets.

“That kid Grayson—stubborn as he11, terrible temper.”

“I know you’re hurting, but you also know what he’s been through these past three years.”

“That month wasn’t something a human being should endure.”

“If it were me, I would’ve lost my mind.”

I’d heard this speech a thousand times.

“I know.”

“You don’t just know. You’ve been incredible.”

Captain Webb glanced at me in the rearview mirror.

“Everyone at the station says Grayson must’ve saved a country in his past life to end up with a wife like you.”

“But Evelyn, sometimes being good isn’t enough to fix things.”

My heart tightened.

“Captain… do you know something?”

Captain Webb went quiet for a long time—so long I thought he wouldn’t answer.

He pulled over by the river and lit a cigar, taking a deep drag.

“About Aria. What Grayson told you wasn’t the whole truth.”

My stomach lurched.

I never expected that what he said next would drag me straight into the he11.",1,1771319714.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

Tiptoed Around His

PTSD for Three Years. Plot Twist: It Was All Cap

My hero cop husband got t0rtured for a month saving some hostage girl.

When he got out? Covered in scars. Couldn’t even perform in bed.

“It’s trauma. Don’t push him.” Doctor’s orders.

So I played the perfect wife for three years.

Drained every penny on his treatments.

Worked two jobs to pay for that poor girl’s tuition.

Slept on the couch for just because “the se//x triggered his PTSD.”

Until at his award ceremony, someone played the wrong video.

There’s my “broken” husband—

Bending that girl over a desk, going at it like a animal.

“You like that? Say my name. Beg for it.”

“Good girl. Take it all.”

Grunting. Moaning. Zero problems performing.

He lunged to cover my eyes.

“Baby don’t look! I had to make that mafia boss trust me!”

“He was watching! It was just part of the mission!”

“Tech team!”

“Who played that video! Shut it off NOW!”

Captain Marcus Webb’s shout exploded across the auditorium.

The blinding light vanished from the screen, and the whole hall went dark and silent.

I sat frozen with ice-cold hands.

The hand covering my eyes smelled like his cigars—familiar.

But that same hand was just gripping another girl’s hair on that screen seconds ago.

“Evelyn. Don’t look.”

Grayson’s voice stayed steady in my ear, but something was tight underneath.

I didn’t move or speak.

My fingers twisted my dress into a hard knot—my nervous habit.

The lights slammed back on and everyone’s eyes locked onto me like spotlights.

Pity. Curiosity. Disgust. Schadenfreude.

Grayson dropped his hand and pulled off his uniform jacket to drape over my trembling shoulders.

“Just a misunderstanding. Special interrogation tactic.”

He said it loud enough for everyone to hear, calm as ever.

“Please continue. Don’t let this ruin the ceremony.”

Like that se//x footage wasn’t just broadcast to the entire department.

Captain Webb rushed over with guilt written all over his face.

“Evelyn, you okay? Those tech idi0ts screwed up. I’ll deal with them.”

He looked at me like a worried father.

For three years the whole department knew about Grayson’s condition.

They knew I quit my job to care for him.

To them I was the saint, the selfless cop’s wife.

Now I was the punchline.

“I’m fine, Captain.”

Grayson’s arm locked around my shoulders, heavy and possessive.

“I’m taking her home.”

He didn’t give anyone a chance to ask questions and walked us straight out.

Cold air hit me in the corridor and I shivered.

In the car, he finally let go.

His scent—sweat and something wild—made my stomach turn.

I stared out the window.

“That was fake.” He started the engine.

“What was fake?”

“The video. I was playing a role to gain the dealer’s trust.”

His explanation came out smooth and flawless.

“That girl Aria was in deep. I had to use special tactics or she wouldn’t talk. I thought that footage was destroyed.”

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Yet a five-foot-nothing woman with glowing green eyes comes in for an interview, and he is immediately under her spell. Yandere Alpha king and Hidden Fae Royalty. The bond wanting  the forest to meet the moon. 

\[Scene 1- The interview begins\]

\[Papers shuffle, door opens\]

Yes, thank you, Barbara. You may leave for the evening. I'll finish up here.

Come in, Miss..sit

(Pause)

I dislike repeating myself, so sit, please

(Chair sounds)

Good

Welcome to Draven Industries

you've had quite an impressive yet..elusive resume trail.

Quiet school, Quite jobs, Quiet reference.

(pen tapping slowly)

Almost..to quiet

(inner monolog whisper, distant mic)

That scent.. forest rain. Moonlit leaves... impossible

(out loud)

you seem nervous. Don't be. I only bite when provoked.

(soft chuckle)

Tell me... where were you born?

\[Scene 2- The test begins\]

(pen scratching)

Family history?

No.. further back

Grandparents? Great grandparents? 

Any sensitivity to moonlight?

(Pause, leans closer)

Do you ever wake up restless.. when the moon is full?

(small amused breath)

No? Shame. I find it.. invigorating 

(inner monolog)

she doesn't flinch. No scent of fear. Only.. green leaves and storm light.

(out loud)

what about wolves?

Do they frighten you?

\[Scene 3- First slip\]

(chair creaks. He freezes)

Dont..

(Low growl slips out)

Don't bite your lip like that..

(Desk cracks under grip)

.. apologies 

long week

Coffee?

(inner monolog)

Those eyes. Green like the heart of an ancient forest. kryptonite. My ruin.

(out loud)

you have unusual eyes

almost.. glowing

\[Scene 4- Corporate Predator Mode\]

You need to understand something before we continue 

I didn't build empires by tolerating mysteries

I've spent my life making myself unassailable 

I won't give my enemies a map to my only weakness just to fulfill a biological urge. 

(Pause. Quiet intensity)

So answer carefully 

Who are you?

\[Scene 5- Alpha Command attempt\]

(Chair scrapes. He stands)

Look at me.

(Voice drops into Alpha Command)

Look. At. Me.

(silence)

... you didn't 

You should have..

There isn't a wolf alive who can defy an Alpha King Command.

(steps around, fascinated)

Are you deaf...or immortal?

(soft laugh of disbelief)

That.. is interesting 

very interesting 

\[Scene 6- Humor Frustration\]

You know, I ruin companies for sport

I've crushed unions, governments, entire markets

Yet here you are.. a five-foot-nothing in a borrowed blazer.. ignoring an Alpha command like it was a polite suggestion 

(Dry laugh)

This interview is becoming very dangerous 

for both of us

\[Scene 7- Control Slipping\]

(inner monolog)

Mate. Impossible. Weakness.

The moon demands a pair, but I demand victory.

(strained, out loud)

You don't understand what you're doing to me?

I am the most dangerous man you will ever meet for one simple reason...

There is nothing in this world I am afraid to lose

because there is nothing I have allowed myself to keep

(Quiet breath)

until you walked into my office

\[Scene 8- Circling Predator\]

(slow footsteps around chair)

You smell like rain on moss

like pine bark after lightning 

like something.. ethereal

You seem human

but you are not 

what are you hiding, my little mystery?

(soft inner monolog)

And why are you fighting this pull.. just like I am.

\[Scene 9- The offer\]

Leave.

Take triple salary somewhere else

I'll buy you an apartment. A car. A life.

Just.. don't stay here

Go. And don't look back.

(whispered desperation)

Please

(inner monolog)

Before I claim you.

(Pause, out loud)

You refuse?

of course you do.

stubborn

beautifully stubborn 

\[Scene 10- Recognition\]

(sudden calm, breath slows)

You calm the wolf

do you know that?

when you walked in.. the beast went silent

for the first time in years

(soft laugh of disbelief)

You are the only thing in this world I can't afford...

yet here I am wondering how much of my kingdom I would burn to keep you.

\[Scene 11- He pushes harder\]

What are you?

Wolf?

Witch?

Vampire? 

(lean close) 

hunter?

(Pause, soft intensity)

You can't lie to me forever

I've looked for weaknesses in my armor for years

I didn't think for a moment it would have your eyes

\[Scene 12- Losing Control\]

(desk slam)

I fought a thousand wars to have nothing to protect!

And in one look.. you've given my enemies exactly where to aim!

(Breathing hard)

The wolf in me wants to claim you..

The king in me knows you are the rope they will use to hang us both. 

(voice soft)

Do you understand now.. why you terrify me?

\[Scene 13- Her Magic Reacts\]

(faint wind, leaves rustle)

You're eyes glow again

Green fire

Ancient forest

...fae

You're fae

(soft wonder)

And powerful

stronger than I've ever felt before 

(small smile)

No wonder you ignored my command 

\[Scene 14- Dark Decision\]

You're not leaving 

Not until I know everything 

Not until I understand why the moon screams your name in my blood.

I told you to leave and you refused 

Now that offer is off the table 

You WILL work here for me

Under me

where I can watch you

where I can protect you

(soft possessive whisper)

where I can keep you

\[Scene 15- Ending Whisper\]

(intense whisper, leans in)

I dont know what you are yet

Enemy

Mate

My ruin

Or salvation 

But hear me clearly

(slightly louder whisper, possessive)

If you're my mate..

I will burn kingdoms to keep you

If you're my enemy..

I will keep you..(sinister) but in a much different way

(sniffs the air, low growl)

Just remember 

from now on

You. Belong. To. Me.

(Low growl)

Mine

My mate

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

So 

I don’t really know how to start it but let me just say that I will play with the years and names to keep my anonymity. 

So I(F23) hooked up with Eric (M23) and now I’m overthinking everything. 

So let’s get a little back story in 2 parts. Part A will be about me and part B will concern mostly Eric. 

Part A

Relationship wise, I’m not that well off although in the moment I always thought I was. I had a crush on a boy, Arnold, back when I was 14, we started dating when we were 17, broke up when we were 19 and got back together at 20, got engaged at 22 and we just broke up because of family issues, value issues and mental health issues basically. So family wise, his parents didn’t like me but acted as if they did, and when he tried to take my part, his household ended in fighting mode because of me. (Where I live, it’s normal to stay with your parents until you marry). Values because he did drugs in the past during the time we were broken up (which I knew of but my parents don’t approve of). Mental health because he’s depressed and I tried so hard to be here and do things but he just gets mad and cornered himself. I love him, I still do, but with everything we couldn’t hold it. 

So then I started going out with another guy, Alex, who was one year older than me. Notable point is also that Alex and I were studying engineering and we met in class as compared to Arnold who didn’t quite complete his education. Alex and I vibed well and started dating last year, it was awesome, basically like in the movies, he waited for me after classes and hold my bag( the heavy ones filled with project components). We went to uni parties and all. And this year we both started working, in the same vicinity. Alex and I tho had lot of fights about Arnold. Maybe for this I might be the A hole because I always tried to help out Arnold (texting only). At first I did told Alex, but then the Arnold thing was less frequent so I just stopped texting him until November last year. We were in exams, and I didn’t told Alex about it. Alex got mad, said stuffs like well Arnold is right for wanting to finish himself because it would made my life easier. I didn’t said anything to that. It hurt but I did understand that Alex didnt like that. But then one day after work (we both work from 8am to 5pm), I didn’t text Alex because well I was talking to my mom and generally having family time, he got mad saying that I only know him during the day and during the night( I usually call him when I go to bed). I talked it out and we were fine for 4 more days before he did the same thing, that is not texting after 5pm. So I thought haha taste of your medicine, I’m gonna “fight” him but he just accepted it. Stopped talking completely. Then when I asked him why he’s acting like that, he said it was over since November and that I need to accept it. It broke me. And we didn’t talk ever again. ( well it’s been like 1 week) 

Part B

So now about Eric. Eric and I met back when we were 17, when we were participating in MUN. A common friend of ours introduced us so that we can plot against the others. We really vibed during that time generally and it was all amicable. It was also just one week before Arnold asked me out. So over the next 2 years, we met here and there because we took some common private tuitions but on different days(another very common thing here where I live). We followed each other on instagram and during mun we talked a lot too. Then we basically just talked about homework, revision notes and stuffs like that, not much. But idk, I had my radars going off when we were 17 tho because the nervous awkwardness just signal a crush but well I was basically a nerd so I didn’t quite understand, plus I was head over heels for Arnold. 

So ig we talked some more during covid, asking where and what we were thinking for uni and he told me that he’s going to study law, weird choice according to his science background but whatever. Then last year, all of a sudden, he replied to my insta story. Ok quite normal ig. The photo was of my back, I was facing the sea, wearing a cute red dress and he answered something like looks quite nice and hi. The looks quite nice is referred to the sea because he went abroad for his studies and don’t have the nice beaches no more. Then we started texting and talking about everything, he told me that he’s going for pilgrimage and he will be back to our home country and that we must meet. He did hint stuffs like when I said I need to watch my niece and nephew, he was like I really want to meet them. I just thought well, he’s outgoing and extroverted ig, which he is. Well anyways, while doing his pilgrimage, he be talking to me a lot, like sending me pics and all. Then he went back to his study country to get his stuffs, he texted less but still a lot, and then he got back. We did meet for coffee and talked a lot again. He was nice company. Different from my usual company but a nice one. Then I got hit with end of year project, dissertation and exams and tbh I quite ghosted him but it was within reasons and I always texted him within the week to say that I was busy. Then after it was all done, he started working too and told me that we should meet again but after 5pm. I remember his exact words, ‘just make yourself pretty, I will be there at 5’. But my mom was like “told him that it’s not ‘study country’ anymore and that maybe he forgot but girls here don’t go out late”. This was half true in general, but fully true for me and well a dinner is a date, not a catchup. I turned him down but he was fine with it. Then he started flirting hard. I told him about Alex and still he was flirting. Then well, work got ahead of us and we got that vicious cycle of responding each week, was weird. Most texts were like I’m gonna slap you for making me wait for your respond. But then when Alex told me this ‘we were over since November’ thing, I texted Eric and told him, let’s meet up. 

I covered my tracks with my mom and I went to meet him. It was too early for dinner, and well I needed to have dinner at home and so did he, so we just snacked and talked for like an hour about how’s work is going, then he kissed me on the cheek, and I turned my head, and we kissed gently. In a soft voice, he whispered hi, just like we just met. It was so nice, like in the movies. Then we made out, penguin kissed and hold hands. Then our time was up and we both headed home. He did check in on me when I got home. So that was Wednesday 11th February. Tbh we are both very busy professionals and we didn’t quite text a lot, between me falling asleep at 8pm and him just being busy and going to the gym and all. I didn’t knew what to expect for valentines. Obviously I wasn’t expecting like a bouquet, but like a message yk. And he texted me, saying his friend died( fact checked out). I understood and today(Sunday) we texted a bit, he told me that he is going out with his brother. 

It’s just idk what to think anymore. 

Maybe some bullet points now

\- \[ \] When we talked before, he did say stuffs like I’m gonna talk to your parents so we can go out

\- \[ \] No, we don’t have labels and that’s what is making me feel weird 

\- \[ \] He showed me his phone when we met, and he was only talking to boys ( I didn’t ask to see or anything but even if there were girls I would understand because my chats are filled with men since I am the only girl on my team at work)

\- \[ \] We did agree to meet again

\- \[ \] His eyes were freaking sparkling 

\- \[ \] Also eric is like a giant. All of them were tall, Arnold was like 1.88m, Alex was approximately the same as Arnold but Eric is 1.92m or more. Also Arnold was like normal size, Alex was thin (and he did kind of fat shamed me) and Eric just have those brood shoulders like rugby players. 

\- \[ \] Yea at first I did regard him as a rebound because Alex told me the November thing on Saturday( the same Saturday he came to see me at the hairdresser and got me food) and we met on Wednesday with Eric. 

So I really need advice. He seemed experienced enough and well I’m not really and everything got me thinking like a lot. So please send help 🥲

\#Update before even posting lmao 

So he did text a bit Sunday night and on Monday we did kind of hold a conversation of 30min over texts. Nothing intimate but more like something you would talk to a close friend. But then he left me on read!!! I texted him at 5pm to ask something (he left it on delivered, ok he’s getting out of work), I send him a video at 8ish pm(ok he’s having dinner or whatever) I text him goodnight at 11pm. He read them all at 2am. No response. 

I think I’m just gonna protect myself at this point and stop caring, put my energy towards more constructive activities. Your advices are still welcome tho. 

Do y’all believe that the effort that I’ve been trying to put out was more likely what’s drawing him away?",0,1771319194.0,relationship_advice,5,0.33,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

This is part 1 of a tool I am building to completely rotate DNS servers automatically, as well as set fallbacks in the case that they go down. 

I'm hosting this on github pages but it's running the benchmark locally (when you press the run benchmark button). **Your config ID stays completely private**, it's only used to build a link to easily copy / paste into wherever you're setting it. You can literally set it to abc123, the benchmark will still completely run.

I started going to this school back in september.

I already know his mom from community work, and she told me he said i'm pretty. At that time i didn't know it was him. I'm also friends with his sister.

His friends say his name when they see me and push him a little. I think he's flustered when they do this.
His friends sometimes say something to me (like one time i had canned coffee in my hands, and one of them said ""girl, you can't buy that"". He probably tought it was an energy drink, you can't buy that in Hungary if you are underage).
They used to say my name too, but i never introduced myself to them.

When we're walking next to eachother on the hallway, he doesn't look at me, just goes with a straight posture, altough one time i was going up the stairs and he was staring at me.

2 weeks ago i posted a story about myself on ig and he watched it.
He didn't like it, so i was a bit sad, but all of his best friends watched my story, even tough we don't follow eachother with his friends.

So i actually don't know what to do in this situation, any advice?

1r71392,https://www.venclikovi.com/does-cyberghost-work-in-japan-my-full-review-2026/,I spent 3 months working in Tokyo/Osaka. Here is the raw truth about using CyberGhost in Japan,"What’s up everyone. I’ve just wrapped up a 90-day stint living the ""Nomad Life"" in Japan—mostly based out of Shinjuku and a bit of time in Kyoto/Osaka.

Japan’s internet is famous for being 10/10 fast, but the **geo-blocking** and **ISP tracking** have become a massive headache. If you’re planning a trip or moving there, you probably know that accessing your home Netflix library (or even basic banking) can be a pain.

I’ve been using **CyberGhost** daily, and since I see a lot of people asking about VPNs for Japan, I figured I’d drop my real-world data here.

**The Speed (Shinjuku Test):** I was on an NTT Hikari line.

* **Without VPN:** 510 Mbps / 3ms Ping
* **With CyberGhost (Tokyo Server/WireGuard):** 445 Mbps / 5ms Ping
* **The Verdict:** Less than 10% drop. If you’re gaming or on Zoom, you won’t notice it.

**The Streaming Situation:** This is where it gets tricky. Netflix has gotten aggressive.

* **Netflix Japan:** Worked 100% using their ""Streaming Optimized"" server. Great for exclusive Anime.
* **Netflix US:** Worked flawlessly from Tokyo.
* **Local Apps (AbemaTV/U-NEXT):** Usually a coin flip with most VPNs, but CyberGhost’s Tokyo IP worked on the first try.

**The ""Bullet Train"" (Shinkansen) Test:** The Wi-Fi on the Shinkansen is... well, it’s there. The constant tower-switching usually kills VPN tunnels. CyberGhost was surprisingly stable, though I did lose connection in the tunnels near Nagoya (nothing fixes that, unfortunately).

**The Reality Check (Privacy):** Japan's anti-piracy laws are stricter than ever this year. Even if you're not doing anything ""shady,"" having your ISP log every single packet is a no-go for me. The No-Logs policy and the ""Wi-Fi Auto-Protect"" in busy cafés (like Blue Bottle) gave me the peace of mind I needed.

**Is it worth it?** For the price of about one Onigiri and a canned coffee a month (\~$2), it’s a no-brainer if you need to bypass blocks or secure your data.

I wrote a much more detailed breakdown (including full speed tables and setup tips for Kyoto Ryokans), which you can find here if you’re interested:

1r710hl,https://www.reddit.com/r/PaymentProcessing/comments/1r710hl/the_stripe_trap_why_99_of_you_are_getting_banned/,"The ""Stripe Trap"": Why 99% of you are getting banned (and why it’s actually not your fault)","I’ve been lurking here for a while, and every day I see 5+ posts like: ""I sell \[Peptides/Kratom/SaaS\], I had 0 chargebacks, my site is compliant, but Stripe/PayPal just nuked my account and held $15k. Why?""

I want to explain exactly **why** this happens from the backend perspective, so you can stop wasting time trying to ""appeal"" decisions that were made by a bot.

**1. You are not a Merchant. You are a Sub-Merchant.**

When you sign up for Stripe, Square, or PayPal, you do not have a merchant account. You are riding on their Master Merchant Account.

Think of it like this:

* **A Real Merchant Account (MID):** You are driving your own car. If you speed, you get a ticket. If you crash, youcrash. The bank assesses your personal risk.
* **An Aggregator (Stripe):** You are a passenger on a massive bus with 5 million other people.

If **one** person on that bus pulls out a bomb (fraud), the driver (Stripe) doesn't have time to check every passenger. They just kick off everyone who looks even remotely similar to the bomber.

If you sell Peptides, and another Peptide merchant on the same ""bus"" spikes their chargebacks to 4%, Stripe's algorithm often mass-purges the entire vertical to protect their Master MID. You aren't being judged on your performance; you're being judged on your category's risk to their infrastructure.

**2. The ""Velocity"" Tripwire**

This is where most of you get caught. You start a fresh account. You warm it up. Then you have a great month and scale from $5k to $30k.

**BAM. Frozen.**

To an aggregator, a sudden 300% spike in volume looks exactly like ""Bust-Out Fraud"" (where a scammer pumps a card, takes the money, and runs).

A dedicated merchant bank wants you to scale because they make money on fees. An aggregator fears you scaling because they are liable for your refunds if you disappear.

**3. The ""Compliance"" Fallacy**

""But my lawyer reviewed my Terms of Service!""

It doesn’t matter. Compliance is for the FDA/FTC. **Underwriting** is for the bank.

You can have the most legally compliant site in the world, but if your MCC (Merchant Category Code) is flagged as ""High Risk"" and you are processing on a platform designed for low-risk retail (t-shirts and coffee), you are a ticking time bomb.

**How to actually fix it (No, I'm not selling you anything):**

If you are doing real volume ($30k+/mo) in a grey-area niche:

1. **Get off the Bus:** Stop looking for ""Stripe alternatives."" You need a direct ISO/Acquirer relationship. You need your own MID (Merchant ID).
2. **Own the Data:** If you don't own your customer data and billing tokens, you are held hostage. When Stripe bans you, you lose your subscriptions.
3. **Fragment the Risk:** The big players don't rely on one pipe. They have a primary MID, a secondary MID, and a backup.

Stop trying to trick the aggregators with ""clever"" descriptors. They have more data than you. Build the right infrastructure or accept that fund holds are just the cost of doing business on borrowed land.",3,1771318556.0,PaymentProcessing,2,1.0,False

At work, I’m in the lowest position since I just graduated and joined as a finance assistant. Alongside finance tasks, I also handle other responsibilities like transporting documents to banks, printing, and general office work. Because I’m new, I didn’t mind—it felt like part of the job.  

There’s an older lady who takes care of the kitchen and serves coffee, and we also have an office assistant for cleaning and other duties. Sometimes, when the assistant isn’t available, I help the lady by some small works like refilling the water filter and other small tasks. Initially, I did it just to help, but now it feels like everyone expects me to do it. People leave the bottle empty, and most of the time it’s me who ends up refilling it. What started as kindness has become a silent responsibility.  

I also try to greet colleagues with “good morning,” not because I always feel cheerful, but because I want to build good connections. Yet, their responses feel mechanical, without warmth. Similarly, I wish friends happy birthday when I see it on social media, but they rarely acknowledge or respond.  

I’m not being nice because I want something in return—I just want to build friendships and good connections. But instead, I feel like I’m the one who suffers. Sometimes I wonder if I’m being “too nice” or if I come across as weak or pathetic. I don’t want to be rude or inconsiderate, because that’s not who I am.  

A few people who know me well understand that I’m quiet, shy, and introverted. They don’t take advantage of me or look down on me, which makes me question why others do. Am I doing something wrong? Am I being overly nice in a way that seems strange?  ",1,1771318442.0,Healthygamergg,3,1.0,False

1r70xs9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1r70xs9/price_of_food_in_gaza_through_january_2026/,Price of Food in Gaza Through January 2026,"The price of food continues to fall in Gaza. Notably, about half of all consumable items appearing in the consumer price index are cheaper in Gaza than they are in the West Bank.

The overall consumer price index for food items decreased about 5% from December to January. It appears that there was some balancing that happened where some items that were very cheap, like rice, increased in price (but are still cheap), while some items that were more expensive significantly dropped in price, like eggs and beef. So it appears that people in Gaza are able to afford a wider variety of foods now.

Here's the usual comparison table:

I believe the table above shows a well rounded set of data, but now I've also made a new table with all consumable items in the dataset so you can see the entire picture. I am very happy to see that all oils have become cheap, as well as a few different frozen vegetables, and even some meats. It seems like people are able to get far more well rounded meals now.

Prices are an indicator of how much supply is entering the area. For example, if there is commercial rice and humanitarian rice, an influx of humanitarian rice will lower the price of commercial rice because people will no longer need to buy as much commercial rice when they can just get more through humanitarian channels. This improves the situation for everyone.

Prices have been dropping since August 2025.

I’m a ’90s kid who didn’t grow up as a full-on Trekkie, but caught enough sporadic episodes of **Star Trek: The Next Generation** and **Star Trek: Voyager** that it eventually pulled me in. In college, I watched all of the “big three” and still hold them in very high regard.  
*Katherine “There’s Coffee in That Nebula” Janeway remains my favorite captain.*

I never gave **Star Trek: Enterprise** a proper chance. Prequel friction played a big role for me — visual upgrades clashing with earlier timelines, and (from second-hand knowledge rather than direct viewing) story choices that felt like they reached too far forward into established lore.

That same disconnect is why I bounced off **Star Trek: Discovery** very quickly. I tried the first episode and immediately lost immersion, especially with the Klingon redesign.

On the other hand, I casually enjoyed **Star Trek: Prodigy** and *loved* **Star Trek: Lower Decks**. Both felt like they did their own thing while clearly respecting what came before.  
**Star Trek: Picard** was uneven for me, but I still appreciated the connection to my favorite era.

I’m even watching **Star Trek: Starfleet Academy**, though mostly because Robert Picardo is a national treasure. So far it feels far more like science-fantasy teen drama than sci-fi, and even the one episode I thought was decent (“Vox in Excelso”) felt like it took far too long to reach an obvious conclusion.



**Why I’m Posting**

After reading a number of reviews and discussions, **Strange New Worlds** seems like it *might* align more closely with what I enjoy about Star Trek. Before diving in, I’m trying to understand the *best way to approach it* given my background and hang-ups.

Rather than asking whether I’ll like it, I’m interested in how others with similar Trek histories approached it.

Specifically, I’m looking for:

* Viewing approaches people used before starting SNW
* Whether certain prior series meaningfully enhanced the experience, or were largely optional
* Any spoiler-light viewing guides or “context primers” that helped things click
* Perspectives from fans who struggled with prequels or modern Trek but still found SNW engaging

I’m not looking to be convinced one way or another — just trying to figure out how much context (if any) actually mattered for people who value the TNG/VOY era.

Overall, our relationship has been good. We have normal fights and arguments like any couple, but nothing extreme. I’ve started thinking seriously about marriage and building a future together. I genuinely see him as my life partner.

Recently, we were at a get together with friends. Some are single, some engaged, some in committed relationships. One friend asked everyone if they had ever thought about breaking up during arguments or doubted their future together.

One friend shared that she and her fiancé once had a huge fight that almost ended their engagement, but they talked it through and are now planning a spring wedding. Most people agreed that sometimes during big arguments you might briefly question things, but that doesn’t mean you don’t love the person.

When it was our turn, I said yes  during arguments it’s normal to sometimes wonder if things will work out, but that’s part of conflict and growth.

My boyfriend said he has never really thought about breaking up during fights, but then explained that he doesn’t think much about the future in general.

That comment shocked me. Later, when we got home, I asked him why he said that. He told me he was just being honest and that he doesn’t really think about the future that much. He said, “I don’t think that far ahead. I just like to enjoy today.”

I asked him directly, “Do you think we’ll be together in the future?” and he said he has never really thought about that.

After that, I went quiet and left the room because I was hurt. He didn’t follow me. He just changed and went to sleep like everything was normal.

The next morning, he said good morning as usual, made coffee for himself, asked if I wanted some (I didn’t respond), and then got ready for work. At lunch he texted asking if I wanted to cook dinner or go out to eat. I didn’t reply. When he came home, I stayed silent. It’s been 2–3 days now. He hasn’t asked why I’m upset or if his words hurt me. He’s acting like everything is fine.

Now I’m feeling frustrated and angry. I’m thinking  if I confront him again, will I look pathetic? But at the same time, it hurts that he doesn’t even seem concerned about my feelings.

The quantity of drugs floating around the campus at Inter in the early 1960s meant the club was equipped like “a small hospital”, to borrow an expression used about the doping culture at Juventus in the 1990s. Inter’s coach Helenio Herrera – or “HH”, as he was known in the world of football – used the players on the youth team as “guinea pigs” for his drug experiments, according to Ferruccio Mazzola, who was on the books at Inter’s academy at the time (and a younger brother of Sandro Mazzola, one of the team’s star players).

“I can describe the effects of those white tablets,” he wrote in a confessional memoir. He said he couldn’t sleep after taking HH’s pills. The hallucinations left him like a fish thrown up on the bank of a river. “I was shaking all over. I looked like an epileptic. I was scared. Also, the effect lasted for days and was followed by a sudden, tremendous tiredness.”

He said a lot of players were reluctant to take them. Taking advice from senior players, they hid them under their tongues and spat them out in the toilet. But it was hard to dupe HH. “Herrera didn’t let himself be played so easily: he dissolved them into coffee, checking as much as possible in person that we took the medicine before the game.”

It was almost impossible for a youth-team player to refuse the juice. It wasn’t the done thing to question HH’s authority. “Herrera encouraged us to take [amphetamines], to use sugar,” said Egidio Morbello, a first-team player. HH was the boss. It would have been fatal for a young player’s career prospects to go against him.

“They were like bombs. They gave you a real kick,” said Pierluigi Gambogi, a youth-team player at the time. “We knocked them back. We wanted to get noticed – to get into the big leagues.”

The side-effects from amphetamines can be brutal. Marcello Giusti was Gambogi’s best friend. He was small, a joker, who played as a centre-forward. Giusti was called up for a midweek reserve game in 1962 away to Como. He travelled with the team but didn’t play. Perhaps as a joke or by coercion, he took one of the white pills that was going around. After the final whistle, he freaked out, climbing the walls in the dressing room and drooling at the mouth like a rabid dog. He was so out of it that his teammates thought he was kidding around.

When the players got on the team bus, Giusti was missing. HH didn’t care and nodded at the driver to leave: “He can catch up with us at the toll bridge.” It was 2km to the highway. Giusti took off running. Luckily, the bus was held up in traffic, so he caught up.

The Italian Football Federation introduced doping controls for the 1961-62 season, but they were easily overcome. “There were a thousand ways to get away with it,” said Franco Zaglio, one of Inter’s midfielders. For European competition, there were no doping controls. “Things changed in the international cups,” said Zaglio, “because you know when a game is worth three million in prize money, anyone can decide to take a risk.”

For doping controls in Italy, vials of urine from a “clean” player – often a substitute – were given to a doped player going for a test. Or HH would put forward a player like Egidio Morbello because he knew he was clean. Teams in Serie A went to elaborate lengths to hoodwink the testers.

Carlo Petrini was a striker for Genoa and Milan in the 1960s. He gave some insight in his autobiography about one of the ploys used at Genoa: “Before the game, the ‘clean’ urine of some Genoa players who were on the bench was put inside five vials: the masseur then hid those vials in a double pocket inside our bathrobes, with a tip coming out of a slot protruding from inside the garment: it was enough to exert a slight pressure and the ‘clean’ urine came out of the spout, filling the anti-doping bottle. An easy, easy operation, also because there was no type of control in the anti-doping room.”

It seems most Serie A clubs did it. “It’s naive to think [Inter] was the only culprit, the only ‘white fly’ in the ointment, amongst the great teams of Italy, Europe and the world,” said Ferruccio Mazzola, who died in 2013. When he published his whistleblowing football memoir in 2004, detailing HH’s doping practices, it caused a feud with his brother Sandro Mazzola, and the club sued Ferruccio Mazzola for libel in 2005, claiming it was “desecration” to suggest HH’s team resorted to doping to achieve its glorious results.

The case was a sensation, as details filtered out about the concoctions HH got his players to ingest, including altered coffee, sugar mixed with strange powders, and vitamins that weren’t vitamins. All the living greats from HH’s Grande Inter were hauled into court, one by one, to give testimony. In 2008, the judge ruled against Inter. The club couldn’t prove that the facts in Ferruccio Mazzola’s book were not true, and incurred the costs for the lawsuit. Mazzola’s old Inter teammates said he was a bitter man. That he bore a grudge because his time at the club was a failure. “If I wanted to hurt Inter in the book, I would have talked about match-fixing and the referees who were bribed, especially in the cups,” he said.

When I asked his brother, Sandro, about HH’s doping programme, I discovered that his stance has softened since he first refused to accept his brother’s whistle-blowing campaign almost two decades earlier. He explained HH’s process, how his amphetamine pills were doled out. “There was a massage therapist in Herrera’s staff who was a close friend of mine. We grew up together in football. He told me everything. He recommended to me not to take those ‘tablets’, but I couldn’t be seen to be avoiding them by Herrera, so I would put the tablet under my tongue, faking it.

“The massage therapist was the one who gave you the tablets, but Herrera was also there to check everyone swallowed them down. I stood there, the tablet under my tongue, without doing anything – then, as soon as he went out of sight, I would put the tablet inside one of my boots. I always brought four pairs of boots with me, for every kind of pitch, rainy conditions, hard surface, and so on. I remember taking those tablets home. I used to see another massage therapist in Como – he was called Ferrario – because one year earlier I had had a muscle problem that was difficult to heal, but Ferrario fixed it.

“So, I kept seeing him for massages and, once, I took the tablets with me and asked: ‘Can you check what’s inside them so that I know? Maybe it’s nothing.’ After a week, Ferrario wanted to speak to me: ‘Thank God, you didn’t take them – it’s Simpamina [the product name for amphetamines sold by a pharmaceutical company in Italy in the 1960s],’ he said. ‘You could’ve collapsed while running! It has very strong side-effects. It’s dangerous.’ Since then, I didn’t take anything else.”",36,1771317842.0,soccer,16,0.88,False

Even 30lbs ago, I use to have a chiseled jawline, I’ve always had full cheeks tho, but after my weight gain my face looks so chubby in photos, I have a slight double chin. I never take selfies of myself anymore. My boobs are huge while I still have a smaller frame but in selfies it makes me look like I’m 300lbs. 

Now I’m trying again to make myself feel pretty and have accurate photos. I’m so disappointed when I look at them. Yes I know the answer is “lose weight then” but it’s not that simple. I’ve been telling myself that for the past 3 years and I haven’t lost any. My weight has just stayed the same. While I don’t have the most physically demanding job ever I also don’t have an office job. I work long shifts 10-12 hours typically, I get off work and I’m fucking tired. I don’t want to go to the fucking gym. 

Then cooking/preparing meals takes 2 hours of my time, so I’d rather order out on days I don’t have that kind of time. The only thing I drink is water and coffee. I occasionally drink alcohol, that’s my “drinking calories”. I’m not out here drinking sodas daily, eating cake, candy, fried foods, McDonald’s, etc. I’m not ready to give up drinking. Even before I started drinking more regularly I was still the same weight I am now. I gained 50lbs and now I just stay there apparently. I eat twice a day, I just have larger meals instead of “6 small meals a day” I don’t have that kind of time, also what a fucking pain in the ass to have to make. 

I’ve finally accepted that I just need to embrace my weight gain and not be afraid to put myself out there. There are woman wayyy bigger than me who are so confident and I’m like how do you do it. 

The thing is no one calls me fat, if I go to the bar I still get hit on by plenty of people. If I dress nice in public I still get attention, so I’m not totally chopped but my photos just suck.  When I put makeup on and a cute outfit I feel good about myself, but then I take pics and they just come out like trash. Idk how to pose, good angles. Before you say “have your friends take photos of you” I have none, and whenever other people take photos of me it’s literally the worst photos I’ve ever seen of myself so not interested. 

I’m so fucking miserable, 25 hit me like a train. Now I feel l’m on the downhill. Never going to have 21 year old skin again, never going to look like I did when I was 18. Just getting older, saggier skin, age spots, even shittier metabolism. Even if I do manage to lose a couple pounds I turn around the next week and gain it right back.
