Is she flirting or just being nice? ,"So I (19m) been friends with a girl (18f) for the past 5ish years. We've gotten very close.She always asks me to do things with her. Random things like visiting universities and calling me in the morning to go do something. She's even signed me up for activities without me asking. We sit together in class and are always talking.

The other day we were having coffee and she starts talking to me about how l'd make a good husband and how her mom told her that l'd make a girl very happy one day. She then preceded to tell me how I'm wasting my time with these girls that don't deserve me (she's usually very critical of the girls I'm talking to, even when they are genuinely nice girls).
‚Ä¢ to me it seems like she's either interested or she's just trying to be a good friend and is looking out for me.

What doesn't make sense to me is she does all these suggestive things but she has a boyfriend. What should I do? I wanted to mention it to her but idk how to do it without making it weird.

Just needed an external perspectives because I have no clue what I'm doing. I can give more detail/examples but im trying not to disclose too much. There is quite a bit of things I found to be suggestive over the past 2 years

","Hey Reddit! I wanted to share my personal experience with something that has genuinely changed my life. Like many of you, I‚Äôve struggled with weight loss for years. I‚Äôve tried countless diets, intense workout routines, and supplements, but nothing seemed to work long-term. I was stuck in a cycle of frustration, feeling like I‚Äôd never achieve my goals.

Electroslim Reviews

Then, I stumbled across something called Electroslim. At first, I was skeptical. I mean, how could electrical impulses help with weight loss? It sounded like one of those gimmicky products that make big promises but deliver nothing. However, I was desperate for a change, and after reading a few reviews and doing some research, I decided to give it a try.

**How Electroslim Works**

Electroslim uses electrical impulses to stimulate fat-burning in targeted areas of your body. It‚Äôs non-invasive, and you can use it while going about your daily routine. The idea is that these impulses help boost your metabolism and make your body burn calories more efficiently. I know it sounds strange, but there‚Äôs some science behind it.

For me, it wasn‚Äôt about replacing my lifestyle but enhancing it. I didn‚Äôt have to overhaul my diet completely or spend extra hours at the gym. Instead, I incorporated Electroslim into my existing routine, and I started noticing changes pretty quickly.

**The Results**

In just a few months, I‚Äôve managed to shed about 40 pounds. I know, it sounds unbelievable ‚Äî but it‚Äôs been a steady and noticeable transformation. What really amazed me was the energy boost I got. I felt more alive, more motivated to stick to my goals, and the weight just kept coming off. The best part? I didn‚Äôt have to give up the foods I love. I kept things balanced and realistic.

**Rose Dawson‚Äôs Inspiring Story**

One story that really inspired me to try Electroslim was that of Rose Dawson, a 57-year-old woman who lost 77 pounds using this method. Her transformation gave me the hope that I could also take control of my health, and honestly, seeing those kinds of results helped me push through the initial skepticism.

**A Simple ‚ÄúSoda Hack‚Äù**

I even used this neat little trick I call the ‚Äúsoda hack.‚Äù It‚Äôs not about drinking a bunch of soda (don‚Äôt worry!). It‚Äôs more about finding a small, manageable routine that works for you, just like Rose did. For me, it was about consistency and using Electroslim daily ‚Äî even if just for a few minutes. Over time, the results spoke for themselves.¬†**If you want to read or buy then click on this Official Website.**",1,1728972380.0,watchantsdieinside,0,1.0,False

1g411g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1g411g7/am_i_taking_this_too_seriously_or_its_normal_that/,Am i taking this too seriously or it's normal that I was so trigerred and disturbed hearing this?,"I am the scapegoat... Lost my mom when I was just 9 years old, and my father when I was 18 years old. He was abusive alcoholic.

I was raised by my aunt and her husband and my grandmother. All of them could easily be placed in Cluster B disorders. My aunt(golden child) is the most dangerous and scary one - high functioning psychopath and the most powerful and dominant one in the family. Then comes my grandmother who fits the criteria of sociopath, and in the end my aunt husband who shows mostly traits of the covert narcissist but also has some psychopathic ones.

My cousins who i grew up with and love them very much are two girls, one is 18 years old and the older one is 24 years old. 

Just a little background...

I am so worried about the younger one way of thinking and behaving and so sad, cause I had so much hope that this could maybe end with us, that none uf us would be like them, although i knew its not realistic based on statistics and other people experiences i seen...

I want to share this with you to hear your opinion, I guess I am writing in hopes someone will tell me that I should not be so worried, that it doesn't mean anything and she might grow out of it...

Sooo lets start... my older cousin was complaining to me few months ago how the younger one is not treating her very well. I asked her what happend, what did she do?

She said to me that she is becoming very selfish and entitled. That she steals a lot of times her money, then when she finds out and is hurt because she didnt just ask her. She if can't deny it anymore she attacks her, insults her and then tells her that its not her fault she is so frustrated.

She also told me that when she buys some new clothes for herself, she takes it without asking and wears it first and acts like its completly normal to do that. But then when she buys some new piece of clothes she says to her: ""This is mine, don't you dare to touch that...""
I feel for my older cousin because she really isn't stingy person and was always protective of the younger one and would share everything with her, so I can understand why this is hurting her.

I was shocked when she told me this because i didn't expected it, but when i asked her does she at least after some time acts remorsful, shows any signs of guilt and apologizes to her??? She said that she does, that sometimes she cries and says sorry to her and that she is not evil, which was weird because I never said that. We ended with this, and I was not thinking much about this because of her positive answer that she shows ""guilt and remorse"" because of treating her sister like that...

Then, on summer I witnessed some disturbing way of thinking with my own eyes and ears that left me speechless...

All 3 of us were going on electronic music festival in our town but seperated. Older one was working there, younger one was going with her friends and me with my friend. I met with younger one at a coffee bar before we went to take our tickets. I remember telling her how i don't plan on staying all night because I couldn't afford to pay all night for astronomical prices of food, drinks and even water... she started laughing and saying ""who even pays for any of that..."" And I am like, what do you mean, I need to drink and eat and i need to pay for that..."" She then goes, You don't, befriend some drunk tourists, ""kiss their ass a little bit"" and they will pay for it all... i do that every year and i get everything for free.
If my mother doesn't want to give me enough money i need to find my own ways...

She was literally saying to me that its ok to use people, just because her mother doesnt want to give her any money or doesn't give her enough.

Then the even crazier and shocking part goes...
She proudly told me how she has idea for the next year to make money... and idea was to buy brownies bring them to festival and sell them to tourists on that festival for 20 euros each, but lying to them that they are cannabis brownies... I was SHOCKED... I told her are you aware that you could put yourself in big trouble with that, that its not ok to cheat people and that she could have police on her neck if someone reports her or even worse if someone decides to go after her because she cheated them...

I (25f) got back to my home country last year after spending 5 years somewhere else. I moved in with my parents after having deteriorated mental health and it was great but just for a while. 

Almost my whole life, my mom has been the sole earner for the family. Despite having a husband, she raised my sibling & I, single-handedly. My dad had no input in raising us, in any aspect. He comes from a generationally wealthy family, had tons of assets (property) in his name. My grandmother was also a single mother of 4 as my grandpa passed away when my dad was only a few days old. My dad‚Äôs older brother had a drinking problem and my dad really wanted to help him but things did not work out. My dad & his siblings were raised along with his extended family so they were all very close. He had so much faith in all of them but his family betrayed him left & right. Almost all of his assets were sold off by family members by forging his signatures. Things went downhill and my dad started to really rely on alcohol (this was all before I was born). 

He made a lot of bad decisions with the money he had left. We could‚Äôve lived a great life still but he didn‚Äôt want to work. We‚Äôve seen how he got after drinking and let‚Äôs just say, he‚Äôs a horrible person. We tried sending him to rehab but can‚Äôt do that unless the person consents. Fast forward to a few years ago, he completely stopped drinking. He said he will never drink and it was great. He was getting back on track, working on suing people who had sold his share of assets and trying to liquidate the ones he still had. 

In 2022, he asked me for some help with money with the promise that he will get it all back to me. There were days when I had just a $110 and I‚Äôd live with $10. Last year, things got so tough for me that I had to go 3 days without food and survived on coffee that was available at work & water.. I was in a dark place and had contemplated ending it all multiple times. One of my really close friends pulled me out of it and suggested that I should take a break & go back home. My dad had promised me to give me $20k that i had given him so far so I can start the business once I was back. 

Its been almost a year since I‚Äôve been back, not able to work because I don‚Äôt have enough experience here & no one would hire me and no savings because well with all that I‚Äôve mentioned above. On top of that, my dad asks for money everyday because he found out I had $300 that I was saving for the festive season & my birthday which is coming in 15 days. I still did give him some and last week, I refused. I found out that he was drinking with that money and that broke my heart. He got drunk and yelled at me & my mom. I told him he needs to give me all my money back and gave him he has till 20th October. He told me that all I talk about is ‚Äúmy money,‚Äù that I am a manipulative & selfish person who cares about no one but herself and for some reason because I gave him money I should be worshipped. These were all his words and the fact that he said all of that killed me inside. To make it worse, he came into my room and told me that he has cancer. My mom confirmed that he never went to see a doctor, no diagnosis absolutely nothing. I love my dad but this wants me to no longer associate with him.

I‚Äôm turning 26 soon & I have no plans. I wanted to give my mom a beautiful life but I feel like an absolute failure now. Life does not feel like living and my dad‚Äôs words sit fresh in my mind. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm in the wrong here‚Ä¶",1,1728971463.0,TwoHotTakes,2,1.0,False

I'm in 3 different minds of which Pok√©mon to put in my team to take advantage of the good sleep day exp boost.

1. Low-Level Pok√©mon (Aron, Shinx, Grubbin, etc). These Pok√©mon are undoubtedly going to be useful when they read Lv. 30 quickly, especially if you have a mono-coffee Grubbin and mono tomatoes Shinx. 

2. High-Level usual Pok√©mon that you already play with daily: the grind from 30-50/60 is a lot. Would it be more beneficial to use the bonus exp a month on 'mons that are already high level so the grind is cut slightly shorter?

3. Whatever ingredient you need the most. For example, I have a level 19 Wartortle who when reaching 30 would be my best Cacao farmer compared to what I already have.

I live in an apartment with three girls, specifically with one I‚Äôll call Lana (F19). The apartment lease says it‚Äôll pay 30 bucks each month for electricity and charge us if we ever go over that amount, and in August, we were charged $4 each. 

‚Ä¶Then in September, we were charged $20 each. Yikes?! That‚Äôs a big jump of price to me when my other two roommates and I have been trying our best to save power. Lana got mad about it a few days ago, saying that she always unplugs everything after she uses it and rent is already too expensive for her. This pissed me off: Lana has an electric scooter, a coffee maker, a hair dryer, a griddle, and an ice maker even though our fridge has an ice maker. She also uses the washer dryer several days a week and uses her hair dryer for a while (tonight she used her hair dryer for OVER 40 MINUTES while on the phone!). She uses a lot of electricity for someone who can‚Äôt afford it!

We are trying to be patient with her and make up for whatever electricity usage she needs by minimizing our own. My roommates have stuff themselves like mini fridges, so they‚Äôre especially trying to be fair with Lana, but I don‚Äôt have anything that uses electricity besides my phone/computer chargers and two lamps. I‚Äôm extremely frustrated that I have to pay 20+ dollars when I not only try my best to save electricity, but barely have anything that uses much power. I‚Äôve tried everything from charging my stuff on campus, avoiding doing my laundry until I run out of clothes, not using the microwave, anything. I am getting mad and desperate.

I‚Äôm horrible at math and science‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know how much this collective electricity usage could be, I can‚Äôt calculate the watts and whatever it‚Äôll cost, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôll be a lot and I feel like I‚Äôm going to lose my mind if our bill gets any higher. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs moral or even legal to force my roommate to pay my share of the utility bill, but at this point I‚Äôm genuinely considering it because I don‚Äôt think this is fair to me. Call it stupid but Lana using that hair dryer for 40 whole minutes was the thing that drove me over the edge. I don‚Äôt want to pay money for a charge I have fought tooth and nail to try and avoid when it wasn‚Äôt even me using the electricity.

I will be upfront in saying I don‚Äôt like her. We don‚Äôt get along for many reasons, too many to get into in this post. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm biased against her, and my other two roommates have already told me this is not worth getting mad over and that I need to stop. I don‚Äôt know. They‚Äôre not on my side, so now I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm overreacting way too much by going as far as considering that she pay for my utility charge.

I don‚Äôt know what to do now besides resisting temptation via stewing in anger in a corner. I would love to get feedback of if I‚Äôm overreacting or not. AITA?",1,1728970210.0,AmItheAsshole,4,1.0,False

Upgrading to a LMLU, so I'm letting go of my Lelit Anna 2 (PID) PL41TEM. As you may know, the PL41TEM is a 57.5mm portafilter machine, so I bought/had custom made a crap ton of accessories to work with it as I went down the espresso rabbit hole. So here we go:

* Lelit Anna 2 PL41TEM in original box with instructions, original portafilter, plastic tamper, all original parts
* Lelit PLA570V 57mm VIP Handle bottomless portafilter (in addition to the one that came in-box)
* Bravo calibrated spring-loaded tamper (custom-ordered from Gilberto Santos in Brazil)
* IMS Precision Competition Basket, 14-16g (B642TH22N)
* Ascasco Precision Double Basket
* 1st Line 57mm tamper with beech wood handle
* Puck screen, 1mm (150um) (custom-ordered)
* Puck screen, 1.7mm (150um) (custom-ordered)
* Walnut wood portafilter tamping station (custom-ordered) (left to right the holes are for puck screen, portafilter, tamper, sworksdesign WDT holder that's not included, and thermometer)
* 57.5mm oak wood magnetic dosing ring (custom-ordered)
* Crema Coffee walnut knock box with lid
* Replacement gasket (Lelit MC047Sil 57mm)
* Cleaning/maintenance tools (can't remember if this came in the box or I ordered it separately)
* Lelit MC747Plus in-tank water softener/particle filter

Not everything is in the photo linked, a bunch of things are kept in the original machine box.

I'm looking for all of this for $600. Included is $200+ of accessories, and I've taken loving care of this machine for the past two years, including regular backflushing and changing out the water softener/filter. Why do I have so many accessories? I've enjoyed a range of light roasts to dark roasts with this machine, but it's required me to use a different basket depending on the roast level to get the right extraction for an 18g dose, and both baskets are sized/shaped differently, thus necessitating a different tamper. Finding good accessories for 57mm was also hard, so I had a lot of stuff custom-made for it. I've also made the recommended OPV adjustment to reduce the pressure coming out to 8.5 to 9 bars (rather than the 10-11 it ships with).

I have a preference for local pickup, but will ship it at buyer's cost (it will be in two boxes, one for the machine and one for the accessories).",1,1728970025.0,coffeeswap,1,1.0,False

What is Alpha Tonic?  
Alpha Tonic is a dietary supplement formulated to boost testosterone levels naturally. Targeting men who struggle with energy, stamina, and muscle-building challenges, the supplement aims to rejuvenate the body's natural testosterone production. With a blend of carefully selected ingredients, Alpha Tonic not only supports hormonal balance but also promotes overall health, vitality, and mental focus.  
  
[üåü Risk-Free Trial: Enjoy our 180-Day Money-Back Guarantee ‚Äì No questions asked!](https://shorturl.at/NMFjU)  


Ingredients in Alpha Tonic  
A key component of any dietary supplement is its ingredient list. Alpha Tonic features a range of natural ingredients that are well-researched and believed to enhance testosterone production. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the core ingredients:  
1. Fenugreek Extract  
Fenugreek is a well-known herb that has been traditionally used for centuries to improve sexual health and boost testosterone levels. Research suggests that fenugreek contains compounds that may help regulate the hormone insulin, which can indirectly aid in maintaining healthy testosterone levels.  
2. Ashwagandha  
Ashwagandha is an adaptogen that has been used in Ayurvedic medicine to combat stress and promote overall vitality. It helps reduce cortisol levels, which can be a contributing factor in lowering testosterone production. Studies have shown that ashwagandha can enhance physical performance, increase muscle mass, and improve stamina.  
3. Tongkat Ali  
Tongkat Ali is another potent herbal extract that supports male hormonal health. It helps the body utilize free testosterone, which can lead to improvements in libido, energy levels, and physical endurance.  
4. Zinc  
Zinc is an essential mineral that plays a key role in testosterone production. A deficiency in zinc is often linked to lower testosterone levels. Alpha Tonic includes zinc to ensure your body has enough of this vital mineral to support optimal hormone production.

# ‚úÖ¬†[Click to Visit the Official Website‚Ä¶](https://shorturl.at/NMFjU)

5. Magnesium

Magnesium is involved in over 300 biochemical reactions in the body, including those linked to muscle function and testosterone regulation. Magnesium deficiency can negatively impact testosterone levels, making this mineral a crucial part of Alpha Tonic‚Äôs formula.

6. Vitamin D

Vitamin D has long been associated with improved mood and bone health, but research has also linked it to testosterone production. Alpha Tonic includes Vitamin D to ensure that testosterone synthesis is supported, especially in men who might have lower levels of this nutrient due to insufficient sun exposure.

7. Boron

Boron is a trace mineral that has been shown to influence testosterone production and improve its bioavailability. It helps the body convert more testosterone into its active form, increasing the hormone's potency.

Stress Reduction: With adaptogens like Ashwagandha, Alpha Tonic helps lower cortisol levels, reducing the body's stress response, which can negatively impact testosterone.Nutrient Support: Ingredients like Zinc, Magnesium, and Vitamin D are essential for healthy testosterone production and overall well-being.

1g40g4r,https://imgur.com/a/D9WE5lM,Bone Graft Membrane Fell Out ,"Apologies for length, I am a very detail oriented person and want to be as thorough as possible to give the best context. 

Questions: 
Should I be concerned and do I need to try and get a sooner appointment with my dentist? 

Should I resume the 850 mg Amoxicillin to prevent infection? 

Should I be concerned about the graft being exposed? 

Info about my habits that may be important:

1. I do not drink alcohol 
2. I do vape, however my partial abstinence is explained later in post 
3. Foods eaten (with one exception explained later in post): Mashed potatoes and Gravy with beef chunks (soft), chicken noodle soup, 1 milkshake, sorbet, potato soup with soft potato chunks, clam chowder, mac and cheese, alfredo pasta, rice pudding, cheesecake bowl (cream cheese filling, with cherry sauce), instant oatmeal. 
4. Drinks: Water (a lot), coffee since 10/11, celsius energy drinks since 10/10. 
5. Have completely abstained from Marijuana since tooth pain started 10/4
6. No bleeding since membrane fell out 10/14


On 10/7 I went to a dentist due to tooth pain. 
I had visited another dentist 10/5 and they told me I‚Äôd need #19 extracted due to severe decay and infection that ended up causing abscess. My gf (clinical worker for a dentistry) had a coworker find a dentist same day to extract due to getting extremely dizzy getting ready for work Monday morning (the 10/7 visit). I had a bone graft done as well as I plan on getting an implant.  

I had been following instructions well, flossing, cautious brushing, alcohol-free mouthwash, salt water rinse several times a day, soft/liquid diet. 

Prior to procedure, I smoked marijuana, and vaped. 
I made it to 10/10, and ended up buying a vape. Have been very sparing with it, but withdrawals day 3 and beyond were causing panic attacks. I have abstained from marijuana completely as I had beat my dependency on it a while back.

I have primarily been eating soups, and mashed potatoes and gravy with beef chunks that were very soft. 

Noticed the stitches (non dissolvable) were getting a bit loose, but I assumed it was from the swelling going down. Stitches are still going through gums where they were put in and have not fell out. 

I decided Friday to dry and eat a quesadilla and fries. Felt mildly uncomfortable so resumed a primarily liquid diet. 

Yesterday morning 10/14, I ate potato soup for lunch, and at one point accidentally bit down on the bone graft side. Was slightly painful, but not bad at all. Around 2:30 PM I had done another saltwater rinse, and I felt the membrane covering the bone graft come out, along with a very small piece of what I assume was graft material. 

It doesn‚Äôt hurt any more than a mild soreness, which was present before. I did however notice that when I did my saltwater rinse, and mouthwash about an hour ago that there was a slight stinging sensation. 


My dentist had prescribed me 500 mg Amoxicillin to be taken 3 times a day for 1 week, and to stop taking the 850 mg 2x a day that the first dentist had prescribed. 
Yesterday (10/14) I finished my last of the 500 mg Amoxicillin. 

I have a follow up appointment on 10/22 that was to remove the stitches and membrane, as well as check the status of the bone graft. 

In case it is important, the disposable vapes I purchase usually last me 3-4 days. The one I purchased on 10/10 has 75% life left on it. I also have not been fully closing my mouth around it, and more so using a normal breath to activate it to try and avoid more than necessary suction. 

I do have a physically inclined job, but have been fortunate to have coworkers willing to pick up the slack where I don‚Äôt want to over exert myself. 

My partner and I have abstained from kissing further than just lip contact, we have however resumed ‚Äúadult activities‚Äù as of Saturday, but have tried to be careful to not overly exert myself physically, and have avoided oral entirely on part to avoid bacterial exposure. 

TL:DR: 1 week after #19 extraction and dental bone graft, graft membrane fell out. Is this bad?

1g4074r,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1g4074r/i_think_i_may_be_autistic/,I think I may be autistic ,"Hello, all.

 I am a 47 year-old man who has recently become aware that I may be on the autism spectrum. I had never considered it until recently when my first girlfriend (when I was 30) and I reconnected on the phone and she told me that she had been clinically diagnosed a few years ago, and that it was such a relief to have ""a reason"" for how awkward and at odds with people she had been her entire life. She also mentioned that she thought that I should be tested, as she saw/sees so many traits or behaviors in me that seem to point to it.

 Again, I had never considered it, as I thought all of my ""quirks"" were results of having been sexually abused when I was younger. The thing is that I have had therapy for this and learned many tools to grow through it, and for many years now it really hasn't been a main source of my problems. That said, I have wondered after so much self-work why I *still* feel like an ""alien"" in society; why I can't ever seem to make/keep friends; why I can't find a romantic relationship; why I can't find a band to play with; why I end up declining going out if I *am* ever invited out, even though I feel so lonely. I spend more time with animals than people. They seem to like and understand me very well.

 So I began looking into it, even taking some non-clinical self testing online, though I am reticent to agree with my results until I can afford the proper in-person testing. I must admit the more I research, the calmer I've become about being me (whoever that is) - just seeing others who have felt such similar feelings has given me a modicum of peace.

 It wasn't until I read about masking that I began to wonder if I'd been lying to myself and others about who I [thought] I was my whole life. 

 So I began compiling a list of these ""quirks"", and if it's alright to share them here, I would like to - and I'd appreciate any thoughts you all may have to offer. I hope that in doing so I will not be offending anyone.

 Here is the list as it stands today:

 ‚Ä¢ putting something down in the exact position that it was found (dust marks, indentations, between two other things, or from memory)

‚Ä¢ putting things down softly (i.e. coffee mug), closing doors softly

‚Ä¢ walking softly, being hyper-aware to remain innocuous as a neighbor or houseguest or second-floor tenant

‚Ä¢ cleaning a host's kitchen rather than socializing at parties I've been to

‚Ä¢ always putting items back in exactly the same place/way I found them every time 

‚Ä¢ hanging clothes on walls instead of folding them; arranging by color/type of clothing

‚Ä¢ one day my clothes feel perfect, but the next the very same outfit wouldn't ""fit"", and so oftentimes I wouldn't leave the house

‚Ä¢ obsession with patterns/seeing faces in everything/numbers/license plates (e.g. one + one = 3 + 3 = 6 = six = 3 = three = 5 = five = 4 = four = 4)

‚Ä¢ weaving window/windshield spots over and under things on the street/highway/interstate (or things in foreground over and under things in the background)

‚Ä¢ taking things so literally that it is impossible to fill out certain forms online or even taking tests (like the online RAADS, etc.) because I don't want to lie to the test/feeling like the test is judging me

‚Ä¢ preferring to write down instructions/have them written so that I do something exactly as it was asked

‚Ä¢ seeing infinity symbol/triangle/lightning bolt/circle depending on the kind of breathing I'm doing

‚Ä¢ obsession with anti-racism/sexism/misogynoir (I can go on and on and on)

‚Ä¢ obsession with over-explaining so that I am sure I'm understood and/or not offending anyone or making myself look bad

‚Ä¢ obsession with making people feel comfortable/safe around me (dating especially)

‚Ä¢ preferring to sit in my own space rather than next to people 

‚Ä¢ saying the thing others won't (which sometimes people like and sometimes they don't)

‚Ä¢ wiping hand down my face/shaking my head violently/repeatedly when stressed

‚Ä¢ spreading my fingers as wide as they can go when I'm talking 

‚Ä¢ periodic tics like small head jerks when stressed

 ‚Ä¢ critiquing commercials/shows/movies for disruption of continuities 

‚Ä¢ hating CBS's ""graininess""/certain types of cinematography or colorization

‚Ä¢ synesthesia (mirror, and color/scenes have tastes and smells)

‚Ä¢ connecting dots, both literally and figuratively 

‚Ä¢ obsession with not stepping on cracks/certain tiles, and obsession with gait length (to avoid as many cracks as possible), or stepping into certain ""complete"" patterns (like a diamond made by leaves) which I feel a ""power up"" from (like in a video game)

‚Ä¢ obsession with bathroom hygiene (both 1 and 2)

‚Ä¢ obsession with cleaning/arranging/notating/filing/alphabetizing

‚Ä¢ obsession with ordering tasks so that they are completed efficiently 

‚Ä¢ repeating myself in conversations but being unaware of it (so I am told)

‚Ä¢ I think I  am cool, but I can't seem to make/keep friends 

‚Ä¢ being ""too intense"" to people 

‚Ä¢ difficulty in reading fiction (except for 'Illusions' by Richard Bach, which I've read over 150 times)

‚Ä¢ obsession with appearance/practicing expressions/poses in the mirror

‚Ä¢ realizing that I'm maybe not sitting correctly in public 

‚Ä¢ talking to myself out loud to ""coach"" myself when I'm too stressed

‚Ä¢ eye contact obsession (too much, not enough?) except with people I really know

‚Ä¢ I was a talented visual artist, but gave up drawing because I would start over with a new sheet of paper if I made even one error

‚Ä¢ obsession with making sure people actually like my company vs tolerating it because I am helpful person

‚Ä¢ patience in relationships (cutting people off if they don't respond as I'd like them to, or perception that they didn't)

‚Ä¢ hating certain textures (clothing, foods, etc.)

‚Ä¢ aversion to sharing food/drink

‚Ä¢ obsession with remembering/playing detective/debunkery/patterns

‚Ä¢ overarching feeling of being ""alien""

‚Ä¢ meticulousness in craft (woodworking)

‚Ä¢ telling myself/other people that I'm an extrovert/super social (but avoiding it when I have the opportunity to be)

‚Ä¢ care not to look at womens' bodies/shapes for fear of being perceived as gross (I never look below the neckline)

‚Ä¢ not really enjoying many tv/movies because of plotholes/interruptions in continuity/being able to ""see"" actors acting

‚Ä¢ repetition of sounds/phrases (usually in private), or quotes from movies/tv/books

‚Ä¢ obsession with appearance *but also* an aversion to vanity 

‚Ä¢ hearing/smelling/sensing things others don't/can't 

‚Ä¢ excelling at detail-oriented tasks/jobs

‚Ä¢ hating authority, but still using care to ""follow their laws/rules""

‚Ä¢ feeling ""too much"" empathy (?), crying in the middle of sentences even if they're not about sad things

‚Ä¢ esier to talk with ""societal outcasts"" (homeless, lonely people, etc.) than others

‚Ä¢ obsession with times + battery percentage on my phone (e.g. 7:44 + 74%)

‚Ä¢ thinking about how I'm running during a run 

‚Ä¢ talking for too long but not realizing it in conversation 

‚Ä¢ binge-watching relationship reality shows/feel good videos/animal videos

‚Ä¢ I don't ""miss"" my family/friends if I don't see them (but I still like when I do)

‚Ä¢ I'm not sure if I can fall in love/unsure if I've ever been in love

‚Ä¢ looking in oven repeatedly before leaving the house (childhood)

‚Ä¢ everything having to be even (e.g. a welcome mat more to one side of door than the other has to be moved so that both edges are equidistant from door frame on either side)

‚Ä¢ hating crumbs/grit/smears on surfaces

‚Ä¢ finger/toe nails must be neatly trimmed, feet must be clean

‚Ä¢ fits in car (yelling, hitting steering wheel) because other drivers are so horrible at it

‚Ä¢ inability to understand what people are actually saying sometimes 

‚Ä¢ obsession with having clean nostrils/no nose hair

‚Ä¢ being unable to eat certain foods if someone plants a mental image (e.g. my friend calls ripe figs _______, so I can't eat them anymore; I won't say what because I don't want to ruin them for anyone here)

‚Ä¢ sleeping/lounging/relaxing in stress positions (hand bent severely at wrist, sleeping on it)

‚Ä¢ obsession with music/same song or album on repeat, sometimes for a year

‚Ä¢ inability to order from large menus


Ok, so that's it so far, but I'm sure I'll add to it. Thank you for your time and attention. I hope that this was okay to do.

&#x200B;

**AITA for breaking up with my fianc√©e for telling her best friend she was not engaged?**

&#x200B;

My now ex-fianc√©e (30F) and me (M27) got engaged 3 weeks ago. We've been dating for 5 years and I finally got the money to give her the wedding she wanted. Well, 3 days ago we were discussing our guest list, and I asked if she wanted to invite her best friend, let's call him James (M30). James lives in another state, but since they were friends for 10 years, I thought I could even pay for his travel expenses since it would be great to have her best friend at the wedding.

She denied, saying that it would take a lot of work to bring him, and she wanted to be a ""family"" event. Countless times she mentioned that James was like family to her, so I insisted, she got annoyed and said ""I didn't even told him we were engaged"". That took me by surprise, I tried to ask why, but she started stonewalling me, and I left her alone. After a couple of hours, I tried to ask her again why she haven't told him we were engaged, and she still refused to tell me, and I admit, my insecurity got the better of me.

In the past, James had confessed he had feelings for her, which she turned down and basically friendzoned him. But by the way she told me, it always sounded like she had him as a backup, something not only me, but her exes realized. She ""married"" him online, they always made they WoW characters look like a couple (like wearing the same transmog and shit like that), when she had a fight with her exes, he was ""always there for her"" and etc.

I told her that made me uncomfortable and if she was not planning to tell him, she might as well consider herself single, cause I would not marry someone who couldn't be honest. Yes, I was pretty immature, but she did something even more immature, she texted him while showing me her phone something like ""hey, just so you know, I was engaged, but not anymore"" and send it to him. I told her to pack her things and leave my house.

Ever since she left, she has been calling me, but I refused to answer. My mom called me (because she apparently called my mom), and said that I was an asshole for ending things for such a ""ridiculous"" thing.

So, AITA?

Edit: sorry for the typo in the title

Edit 2: hey guys, I made some dinner and I think I'm gonna go with u/DoneOver69Position (cool username btw). I'm gonna ask her to meet up and ask to see their messages. And to u/FoxySlyOldStoatyFox, I'm already low contact with my mom, but I'm going to make my decisions after I clear everything up. So I'm kinda promising an update.

*NTA, there is a reason she won't tell her ""best friend"" that she plans on getting married. I mean most women think getting married is one of the biggest things in life, and tells everyone she knows. Unless it will put a damper of something. You know boyfriends hate hearing their girlfriend is getting married*

*So your ex fiancee didn't want to tell her boyfriend about you. Unless you poly sounds like a great reason to end an engagement.*

*If you want to confirm that she was cheating, offer to meet up with her for lunch. When you get there, tell her if she wants any chance with you she needs to unlock her phone, and you read all of her messages between him and her on all media. I'm sure you will find more than enough to confirm that leaving is the best choice.*

*.... Even in a poly relationship that's still messed up, lying, and cheating. Polyamory requires honesty and transparency on each of the relationships*

**DoneOver69Position**

*Poly allows you to make rules based off of how you and your partner agree. I have known a couple of people who have had successful don't ask don't tell polyamorous relationships. That is their choice and how they choose to be. That is the only time I could figure out how this could possibly be okay. That is why I put that exception. But some people who are poly don't accept don't ask don't tell us a viable relationship, and to that I say allow people to make their own choices on how they choose to be in a relationship the same way you would like people to allow you to choose. Personally with my 16 years experience with polyamory, I prefer kitchen table poly, but I also accept that people have different things that work for them.*

**Update - 1 days later**

&#x200B;

Hey guys, I just got home after talking to my (still) ex-fiancee, and since a lot of people asked for an update, here it is. But, I want to clarify a few things.

As commented on my original post, I pay for the house since I bought it before dating her and I asked her to move in, since it was close to her job. I work from home since I'm in tech, but she had to go to work, that's why I paid for her car, to help her commute (and honestly her salary is shit). I was her partner, so I didn't see any problem with that. I thought she was the one, despite everything, she is smart, funny, we had chemistry, but I felt betrayed.

To the update.

We met at a coffee shop on the premise we would discuss how to save our relationship, at least, that's what she thought. As soon as we sat down, I asked to see their messages. She got defensive immediately and told me she had deleted everything. I asked to see her phone anyway. She started to cry, ugly cry, asking me to stop. At that point I had already decided I was not going to be part of the relationship anymore, but damn, I was curious. It took a good 20 minutes for her to hand me her phone, a lot of crying, even a waitress asking her if she was ok.

So I read the messages. There wasn't any cheating like nudes being exchanged, them professing their love for each other, but what I read still stung. There was a lot of shit talking about me. A LOT. Texts and texts of them saying how terrible of a person I was, criticizing my hobbies (i like video games and pro wrestling) saying I wasn't a real man because of them and stuff like that. But there where two topics that caught my eye. One where she had told him I was having trouble getting hard and that was frustrating for her. And one where she was complaining about how she didn't want to be ""stuck"" in our relationship.

Yes, I was having problems in bed... because I was sad because my father had passed away (6 months ago) and the ""stuck"" thing, I remember telling her that when we got married, IF SHE WANTED she could leave her job, and I would provide for both of us. I don't know if she took this the wrong way, but I guess it was related to that. I honestly don't know.

By the time I gave her the phone back, she was already giving excuses on why she was saying those things to him, how he was like a ""therapist"" for her, and then she asked me ""don't you complaining about me to your friends?"" and I simply replied ""no, I don't"". She started crying again. I took a pretty deep breath and just said ""just give me the ring back"" (I didn't had the ring with me, like some suggested). She hesitated a bit, but gave it to me anyway. I stood up and asked her to delete my number and to not bother me anymore.

I called her mom and asked her to pick up her daughter's stuff at my place. Her mom is a good person, I'm just realizing I'm going to miss her as I write this. She understood why I decided to end it, but she didn't asked much, and to be honest, I'm glad she didn't. As for my mom, I didn't called her, I just blocked her for things unrelated to this post, I just realized she never had my back in anything, I was always trying to save an already failed mom-son relationship.

Before I leave, I just want to clarify. I was never against her having male friends, or any type of friends. People are going to cheat, friends or no friends. I remember my dad saying something to me when I was a teenager, he always said ""opportunity makes the thief"", but I do not agree with that. Anyway, since I have the next two weeks off work, I going to figure what to do with the wedding money, drink some booze, play games and watch Monday Night Raw later.

Peace.

PS: sorry for any typos, but I fixed the title now.

Edit: a couple of people are asking about the car. Is a 2015 Nissan Versa which she crashed 2 times, both times she rear ended someone. Never liked the car, weak engine, the interior feels cheap and overall bad, so for all I care she can keep that piece of shit. I would have more luck throwing it off a cliff than selling it.

Edit 2: Little update. Her mom called me a few hours ago to check on me and to ask when she could come and pick up ex's stuff. We spoke about the car and she basically ""forbid"" me to let her daughter keep the car because: 1 - I paid for it. 2 - Ex wouldn't be able to maintain it. So I'm going to keep the car until I'm able to sell it (god help me).

Also, some people called the story fake, cause they said I wasn't a ""real man"" for playing games, and yet they played WoW. To be honest, that's on me, cause I wasn't very clear. The ""real man"" thing was more about the pro wrestling hobby than the gaming hobby, but in some messages they clearly mocked me for playing some games (Life is Strange Series) in one I remember James saying something like ""How could a grown ass man play such a girly game and cry?"" Yes, I cried playing Life is Strange. I also cried to RDR2 (the I'm afraid cutscene still makes me emotional). I'm a crybaby I guess.

Also I want to thank everyone who message me to talk about wrestling and games, it really helped me take my mind out of everything. I haven't replied to everyone, but I intend to. If anything happens, I'll let you guys know. Be good people.

*James saying you‚Äôre not a real man because you play video games, while simultaneously creating his WoW character to match a girl who smacked him into the friendzone/backup plan option, is galactic levels of cuck fuelled irony*

*Dodged the ballistic missile! She did not want to be stuck to you, then why cry for a marriage she doesn't want. Oh, but she is going to miss the wedding, that's what she wanted. Let's see if her best friend/boyfriend can provide her with one. Oh man, there are four billion women in this planet, be patient yours will find her way to you, but not this POS.*

So here's the situation,

I (35m) working met somebody (25f) studying fashion in October last year. Everything I could ever want in a woman. We got together pretty fast, we got physical really fast, just two in love inseperable people.

Ater a few months I sometimes felt like I was giving more than her. she never really wanted me to invest in her. I don't mean going on fancy dates or buying her things, I mean emotionally. While also she was very very reciprocal for love and affection. She had her way of showing it but it was just always less. I even threw out an I love you, but never got it back. Already some red flags. Mind you I was never really all over her constantly, I gave her enough freedom and space.

She's an expat studying here, so during the summer she went back to Spain to visit her family for three whole months, she never asked me to come with her, but she did send me updates of her life there. So I feel she kept me secret to her family this whole time. Cause when she got back she came with her dad who stayed there for another week,  and I could only see her after her dad left. So again hiding me. I didn't think much of it and let it slide cause I would just be too nosy.

We didn't hang out that much in September and this month now, cause she is is busy with her master year, which is asking a lot from her.

Two weeks ago we went on a date, things felt off. And it made me frustrated that we weren't as close as before, I jokingly said I would need a new girlfriend after some stupid thing we were joking about. She laughed and said it would be ok we would be going for coffee. So the day after I texted that I felt she was waiting for me to break up with her cause I felt nothing more than a friend. I felt unloved. And she didn't have the balls to do it herself. The thing she said bugged me hard and rubbed me the wrong way. I said if you wanna make this work then I need more time from you, I was hardly seeing her. Like if you care you would find more time right?

She said she cares for me a lot but she needs time and space, that we go in circles cause I ask more, she can't give more, we talk, I ask more. It's taking half of her mind, and she can't do that cause she needs to focus on her priorities which are her studies. She doesn't want me to wait for her and feels we are living two different realities. She thinks I think she's the woman I want for the rest of my life, and said she's not.

She doesn't want me to change but she said she needs a bit of distance cause our lifestyles are not compatible right now.

So all this time I felt like she just used me to fill that lonely void of being alone in a city, not wanting anything serious but never really fucking telling me straight to my face, always just stringing me along. Just somebody to keep her warm at night and give her validation. Feels good right? So never really giving the guy back what he deserved.

The keywords here are give her time and space, incompatible lifestyles **right now**. She never mentioned the words breaking up. She would love to go for coffee in a few months but thinks it's a bad idea right now.

So.. I don't want to wait but I also don't want to move further. I was happy with her, and I know if she ends her studies she could give this a lot more energy. She never really fought for this, just let it happen, giving in to the situation which can't be changed. Why let a person go like this this easy? I could find another woman sure, doesn't bother her apparently.

She knows I would be an amazing partner, I gave her my best while putting myself first a lot.

Will she come back or am I a fool that got used?

Either way I'm disappearing from her life, no contact.

1g3zlss,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1g3zlss/why_did_rory_think_she_was_supposed_to_just_be/,Why did Rory think she was supposed to just be Mitchum‚Äôs assistant?,"To preface this, I am not a Rory hater, I think Rory is a brilliant and hardworking girl. But I believe Rory squandered her role at the paper by focusing her efforts on being a good assistant, rather than a journalist. Mitchum told her that she should take this opportunity regardless of the circumstances and prove herself. I think Mitchum was testing her, by purposely giving her little instruction in her role, to see what she would do with it. And Rory completely self-assigns herself the assistant role when her role is an intern, which is a lot more ambiguous.

When Logan gave her advice on how to make a good impression on his dad, he gave her a couple tips that could have improved Mitchum‚Äôs perception of Rory as a journalist/ as a person, but what did we see her act on? She picked the one thing that would make her a better assistant, making him a decaf coffee.

I also notice that she always waits for Mitchum to ask her to do anything meaningful before she does it herself. But on her first day, he tells her to shadow him. Shadowing a CEO isn‚Äôt the role of an assistant. It‚Äôs so obvious from the beginning that he expected her to do more than just make coffee and organize his schedule, but that‚Äôs really most of what she did. (That we see)

I understand how hard it is to know your place in this situation, and I get not wanting to overstep. But I also know that when you are given the opportunity to exist in a sought after environment like this, at an up-and-coming paper with a special invitation from one of the most successful journalists in the world, you have to shove through and grab your success rather than waiting for it to be handed to you. Rory had ample opportunity just being there to show that she was talented and capable. She could have offered to read over some of the journalists‚Äô stories and left insightful comments, she could have started her own side project and pitched it to Mitchum. Worst case scenario she gets told no, gets shot down and told to stay in her lane. But at least she would have been perceived as driven, having passion, having an urgency to break into the world she‚Äôs chased her whole life. But she didn‚Äôt do any of that. 

Given this, I think Mitchum‚Äôs feedback to Rory is more than fair. He was expecting her to proceed with at least a fraction of the ambition that he would have demonstrated at her age. And when he saw what she decided to do with her shot, he concluded that she didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúit‚Äù. I think that‚Äôs completely fair. 

I would love to know what other people think about this! I know Mitchum is pretty hated and I definitely think that he‚Äôs not a good person but I think I can at least understand his perception of her, regardless of his statement‚Äôs accuracy.
