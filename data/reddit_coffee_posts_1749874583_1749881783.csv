We have had our ups snd downs over the years but the last 4 have been very difficult. We don't have relations any more, whenever I try its a no, she never shows any affection, I am the one who try's to hug but she just keeps her hands down. She says she does not want to live here. She has been a housewife , she did have a job for about 4 weeks at my place but got let go. I live in a granny flat downstairs which was part the the house we purchased 7 years ago. She looks to start an argument all the time, and she has said she wants a divorce on 3 separate times. The last time I saw real hatred in the eyes. She does not gledn up much, just orders takout slot for the kids, My parents live near and have tried to be supportive but she says they are interfering and just gets mad again, I feel like I sm walking in eggshells I think she wants to take the kids to Thailand, but I cannot work there, I would  not be able to earn money . I understand her situation but she agreed to marry me and live in the uk, she is a uk citizen now. I do want my kids to choose where they want to live when they are older, they all can get thai citizenship and be duel nationals etc but while they are young I want them to stay here where we live and I can provide for them. I don't want to move out as I can't afford to rent anywhere and would miss the kids. I have said I don't want s divorce anf we are in this limbo land. They kids are great. We always holiday in thailand where her mum snd bro live, and her family are kind and so are her friends with the kids. The kids love thailand but everytime they are on holiday there and get treated everyday and stay at a nice vomplex with a swimming pool etc I rent know what the future holds, Wether she wants to sell our house here which I never want to do as its going to be a safe place you all my kids in he future etc. I am still paying the mortgage. I work 6 days week 9 to 5 wolith alternate weekends and try to take the kids somewhere on my dad off but dhe makes yhings very difficult; or maybe I fo with poor commuition. I am trying to at least say 5 things to her each day new subjects like would you like a coffee is one.

I am trying to do best but sometimes I get very down, I have lost contact with alot of my friends and find it had to even make small talk at the school run I welcome any advice, I have tried some anti depp in the past but would have to pay for them so not sure. I am trying to tidy up alot now and trying to help round the house more . She really does not do anything now; she is late ip everyday the kidsxsre late to school, my rudest wants to be home-schooling now as my wife is saying she does not want to live here.

1lb1phb,https://i.redd.it/hiitwtj04u6f1.jpeg,Let the testing commence.,"A few weeks ago I started looking at getting something to listen to music to when I get up when the family are still in bed. I have. SONOS Beam and Play One’s in the lounge but this can be a bit much when I’m up at 6am on weekends and the family are still asleep.

I bought a SONOS Roam but again you have to have it louder than what I would want it to hear anything. It also doesn’t help that I’m a few years away from 50 and my hearing seems to be slowly declining.

I have had AirPod Pros for the last 3-4 years but rarely use them because I find as soon as I move they tend to fall out so thought some over the ears would be a good fix. I also occasionally travel for work so again over the ears would help in that regard.

I saw a lot of adverts recently for the new Sony XM6 and the XM4 was in the budget that I wanted to spend so thought it would be a simple purchase and then the rabbit hole opened and I fell head first into it. As soon as you look into the XM4s, Sennheiser Momentum 4S come into it and eventually Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S2e rears its head as well.

After going back for forth for a week or so I couldn’t decide on which ones to get so I decided to get all three and return the two that don’t do it for me. 

It’s now 7:05am on a Saturday morning, the coffee is on and it’s time to start testing. I will update this post on some basic thoughts and which ones I preferred just incase it helps someone else.",0,1749881471.0,headphones,0,0.5,False

1lb1p5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lb1p5u/impulse/,impulse,"I wasn’t supposed to be there that night. No contract. No objective. No instructions waiting in some encrypted message. Just me, parked across from his building, engine off, watching. Not out of duty. Out of curiosity, maybe. Out of boredom.

He wasn’t important. At least, not to anyone who mattered. Just a name I’d been given weeks earlier, with no follow-up. A placeholder. Someone to look into, not someone to remove. I’d already finished my last job. Wasn’t even on the clock. But I followed him anyway. Something about him stuck.

He kept to himself. Lived a simple life. No wife, no kids. Some finance job. Walked the same route every day. Same sandwich shop. Same coffee. Carried a reusable water bottle. Like he was proud of that. He moved through the world like it owed him nothing and he expected even less in return.

And for whatever reason, I kept watching.

That night, I sat in the car longer than usual. It was cold, but I didn’t feel it much. I didn’t feel anything much. Just a stillness, and that small pull that had been getting stronger each day. Something in me wanted to see it play out. No reason. No justification. Just a feeling.

At some point I stepped out of the car. Didn’t think about it. Didn’t psych myself up. The gun was already in my coat pocket. I crossed the street. He was just ahead, walking like he always did, earbuds in, keys in hand.

Three shots, mid-step. He collapsed. No sound, no struggle. It was over in seconds.

I turned around and walked back to the car. Drove two towns over. Checked into a motel under a name I didn’t use often. Sat on the bed for a while, staring at my hands.

I didn’t feel panic. No racing heart. No shaking. If anything, I felt calm. Completely calm.

This wasn’t like the others. There’d always been rules before. Plans. Escape routes. Timetables. Clean entries and cleaner exits. I took pride in that control. I thought that was what mattered.

But this—this felt better.

Not because it was easier. Not because it was messier. Because it was mine. I wasn’t following orders. Wasn’t acting on someone else’s decision. I chose it.

And I liked it.

I liked the way it cut through the noise. The way everything else—money, people, time—just disappeared for a moment. All that existed was the movement, the act, and the silence that came after.

I keep seeing his face. Not in a way that haunts me. I remember it like you’d remember a painting. Something still and complete. That flicker of awareness in his eyes just before he dropped—it stuck with me. It wasn’t fear, not really. Just surprise. That something could actually be happening to him.

I think about that moment a lot. The way it felt. How natural it was. How right.

And I know I’ll do it again.

It won’t take much. Another face. Another quiet street. Another evening with nothing on my calendar. That feeling will rise again, and I’ll know it’s time.

I won’t need a reason. I don’t want one.

Because I don’t regret it.

Because I liked it.

And because part of me is already waiting for the next time.",1,1749881437.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Two characters, A and B, with some deaging shenanigans involved. 

A (late twenties male) has not been eating full stop for at least a week, almost certianly more, though they've been eating less and less for about a month. They have been drinking water, though are likely dehydrated, and is mostly subsiding on coffee. They are also under tremendous amounts of physical and emotional stress, and are receiving lots of soft tissue injuries - incredibly painful, but largely to extremities and not intended to kill. They are also very sleep deprived and engaging in strenuous activites in intermittent bursts (hours of activity between days of relative rest).

B (same age as A) has not eaten for at least a day, likely more. They haven't been eating well before, and are also under lots of emotional stress, as well as living out of their car (so poor physical conditions). Their food was not very nutritious before, and largely consisted of whatever can be stolen from gas stations and did not need to be cooked or otherwise prepared, with fast food to occasionaly supplement it. 

Both are de-aged to twleve years old, with their physical conditions being transfered to their younger selves as well, and are stuck in a remote cabin with either some cans of soup and a few packets of saltine crackers, or nothing at all. How long this could go for without the characters being at high risk of refeeding syndrome, if they could go any longer at all. If the latter is the case, would they be able to have the soup and crackers, and what might help avoid refeeding syndrome without the involvement of professional healthcare?

In addition, would they still be able to walk for multiple hours in the snow, presuming that they have appropriate clothing, or is that too physically demanding. Also, any additional information on starvation and its expereince is appreciated.",0,1749880614.0,Writeresearch,0,0.5,False

But my issue was to save a bit of money spent in Starbucks. 3 coffees from Starbucks = month long coffee supply at home. 

Never was interested in drinking for taste or something. Dark roasts and medium dark roasts from Devans, BT and Starbucks Signature roast.

Last week, I purchased a MHW-3Bomber Blade R3. The coffee I bought was Hunkal Estate Aranya Gold (dark roast) and Nandan Coffee (light roast).
I have not been able to taste anything different, and know that it is a long process with dialling in the grind settings.

But the question I thought about and my father posed to me is:

Since we (especially my family) are heavy on tasty spicy non-veg food 3/4 times a week, maybe the heavy palette and blasting spicy masalas are stopping me from tasting the subtle notes? 
PS: maybe the coffees i bought are not that great lol.

tl;dr - does heavy palette of indians, especially non vegetarians influence the ability to pick tasting notes faster?

Just a discussion, no opinion from my side. Coffee recs and advice for myself appreciated.",2,1749880499.0,IndiaCoffee,2,0.75,False

1lb1fie,https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/1lb1fie/there_arent_really_that_many_opportunities_to/,There aren’t really that many opportunities to meet people in 2025,"blue pill likes to emphatically proclaim that there are ample opportunities to meet people, mingle, and date in 2025- even outside of college … yet at the same time will denounce cold approach.

I think a lot of men’s major hurdle is just finding good, quality opportunities to meet compatible women. You have bars and clubs- where women tend to be isolated in cliques and it isn’t am optimal environment for a lonely or awkward man to meet people. Additionally music is always blaring loudly which reduces chances for conversation.

Singles events are hard to come by in a number of cities and it very much depends on the location if many women will even attend or if it will be crowded with desperate men.

There are hobby and meetup groups- however these tend to be attended by older people or else people are already coupled. The ones which are specially targeted at younger people do seem to be more promising… but these are intermittently scheduled and not abundant- and many are overcrowded with men looking for women. I went to one last week and it was like this. Hobby classes like cooking lessons are mainly attended by married people, in my experience.

You can attempt to approach in somewhat warm settings like a coffee shop but cold approach is pretty much irrelevant in 2025 and for good reason- it’s intrusive and bothersome. 

Dating apps are cited as a place men need to avoid due to how ruthlessly lopsided they are… and I find this to be correct. It’s not so much that a guy can’t get a date from these apps… it’s just that the amount of effort you have to put in isn’t worth the results- women who aren’t compatible with you and wasted time.

In my opinion, there aren’t really that many good opportunities for a young man, particularly a post college age 23-29 yo young man to meet people. 

It is no mystery why many young men are seeking out the gym, video games, or AI to distract from their dating struggles as these tend to be more fulfilling, even if it’s just short term pleasure.",3,1749880441.0,PurplePillDebate,4,0.8,False

1lb1dse,https://youtu.be/VaBRY6PYNLI?si=RcwjBGcQXF2ENXmy,"☕️ Had a Cry, Made a Caramel Latte, Resumed Life Like a Soft Queen With a Spine 👸","The other day I had what can only be described as a low-key emotional spiral, the sort where one small thing (in my case, a rogue sock) sends you into a minor existential crisis over everything from your five-year plan to whether you’re just fundamentally annoying.

So, naturally, I had a bit of a shower cry. Not dramatic, just quiet weeping into the steam like someone who once read a Virginia Woolf novel and got far too into it.

But here’s the twist… I didn’t push it down or tell myself to snap out of it. I got out, wrapped myself in my fluffiest dressing gown, and did the one sensible thing left:

Marched straight to my coffee machine and made a caramel latte, with full fat milk, because comfort is king and I refuse to apologise.

And you know what? I felt human again.

There’s something weirdly powerful about facing your feelings head-on—just letting them happen, without judgment or trying to “fix” yourself immediately. That latte tasted like emotional clarity. Suddenly I could answer emails, reply to texts, and remember my Amazon password like a fully functioning adult.

So I’ve decided:
Vulnerability is chic now. 🐣
Crying is cathartic. 😭
Caramel lattes are therapy. ☕️

I’m not calling it a breakdown anymore. I’m calling it a seasonal emotional reset, followed by frothy self-respect and a generous pump of syrup.

If you’ve had one of those quietly unravelling moments lately that somehow left you stronger on the other side,tell me about it. Let’s normalise the tears, hype the recovery, and toast to emotional resilience with something espresso-based.

so to give a brief background, yung tita ko at yung mga 3 na anak niyang lalaki ang nakikitira dito samin. sa bahay ng dad ko so it’s really ours. they moved here samin a year ago to originally look after lola and para malapit nalang, and for tita to also take care of me since my parents and brother are abroad. 

3 lang yung mga naka built in na kwarto so its my tita, her bunso and panganay, that are also living in here w me. yung middle is nakatira kay lola pero malapit lang so talagang nakakasabay sa kainan at minsan tumatambay dito.

so what seems to be the problem? i honestly can’t stand the 3 of my boy cousins. napakadugyot yung galawan, as in. NAKAKAINIS. naaawa na lang ako sa tita ko minsan kasi not only she does most of the household chores (though i always help everyday), she also manages a sari sari store pa. though tinutulungan naman siya ng mga anak niya na magbenta pero that asides, wala na. 

after every kainan, these boys will literally just leave their plates at the sink or worse, sa dining table lang talaga tapos si tita nalang mag aayos. e syempre ako since si tita na nagluto and all, ako na naghuhugas ng sarili kong pinggan. especially dun sa panganay, deretso sa kwarto after kumain. like how lazy could you get. same thing dun sa bunso. uupo deretso sa sala and watch tv or play ml. not even one is willing to help clean the living room unless pagsabihan e. 

then every morning when i’ll go make coffee, pansin ko hindi tinatapon yung coffee sachet deretso sa basurahan at iniiwan lang dun kung saan nakapwesto. like tangina dude, ang lapit na nga lang ng basura, hindi mo pa kayang itapon. ano pa silbi ng mga paa mo. tapos hindi hinuhugas yung mug na ginamit pang inom at spoon to steer. deretso sa lababo when washing those could just take LESS than 5 mins. 

there was even this one time wherein nagbiro yung panganay habang naghuhugas ako ng plato ko at nagbiro at nagsabi na isabay ko na rin daw yung mga pinagkainan nila. ULOL. tinarayan ko nga by saying na “pinagkainan mo yan so ikaw maghuhugas at hindi ako”. ayun medyo natameme tapos sinabi nalang in his defense na “act of pakikisama lang e”. DUDE, PAKIKISAMA MY ASS. kasimple simple na nga lang yung paghugas ng plato, hindi mo pa magawa. TAMAD. 

and lastly, pansin ko rin minsan sa pag gamit nila ng banyo at iihi sila, makikita ko na may naiiwan na yellow drops ng ihi nila. hindi pa pinupunas. sobrang kadiri talaga. mga sarili talaga ang iniisip, pwe.

ito naman si tita, sobrang soft hearted sa mga anak niya. di ko alam kung bakit hindi niya kayang pagsabihan at hinahayaan lang. tapos maglalabas ng sama ng loob sakin minsan na wala daw tumutulong sakanya sa gawaing bahay. e bakit hindi mo kasi pagsabihan. jusko. kainit ng ulo.

(di ko talaga pinapansin yung mga pinsan ko dahil anti-social at introverted ako pero most of the time talaga i cant help but notice these nasty shit they be doing).

1lb1baf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lb1baf,SCP and Canonicity/Continuity,"The sub has a growing sentiment that SCP is made by *anyone*. You’ve read two articles, and want to write your own? Well, it seems this sub thinks that you can, and with no oversight or quality control from the community.
     
The idea anyone can write, and publish an article is, and always has been the main argument people use to try and say that *”You shouldn’t/CAN’T scale SCP.”* which I want to make a post about to clarify. 
    
I also want to point out the main problem with discussions involving SCP in here which is: A lack of understanding. 
    
The people who complain about SCP, and those who use it to shut down every argument with *”SCP-XXXX solos”* both argue in bad faith and don’t actually understand what they talk about.  
     
**WHO CAN WRITE FOR SCP, AND HOW?** 
    
despite what I said above, *anyone* could hypothetically write for SCP. 
   
I’ve attached 10 photos that show the content creation process for writing an article, and the content policy to make sure you follow SCP’s format. 
     
Their is an 8-step process, involving a few drafts, green lights from peers and reviews on (if used) javascript and html. 
    
Their is also the scrutiny of the community, which your article is subject to once it makes it past idea review, peer review, rough drafts etc and is posted to the wiki. If it falls below -10, you’re article is deleted and can’t be re-made. 
     
SCP’s content guidelines also effectively “ban” the creation of certain genre’s of SCP’s once they’ve been written about in abundance. For example, The **Original SCP-096** wasn’t the Shy Guy, it was an Air Conditioning unit. The Original SCP-096 froze anyone who turned on the AC unit. Currently, ***”No anomalous objects that over-do their trait”*** is a guideline due to objects similar to this existing in abundance like SCP-536 (Knobs that can change fundamentals of science), The Coffee Machine, SCP-018, and more. 
     
This is just a small fraction of the many checkpoints you have to pass through if you want to even begin the rough draft of an idea you have. The average 13-year old from TikTok wanting an OP character to solo, is not going to make it through these hoops. 
     
The quality control, writing guidelines and content policies also help to fortify the wikidot from poorly written articles, as well as blatant OC fiction. Fans of SCP aren’t trying to be pretentious if they say quality control is strict. It is strict to keep a consistent theme, and quality. Something you’ll come to appreciate after reading so many article is the scientific tone, a consistency **required** in everything. 
     
Everything discussed above, **are effectively identical to how other fictions deal with continuity**. 
   
DC Comics? Barry Allen is the flash, and he’s fast. Grant Morrison uses the Flash bound in a wheel chair, teams him up with Swamp Thing. Other’s use Wally West as a civil protector, or in Flash Forward, he’s a cosmic being (This is the Mobius Chair Variant.). 
     
Wally West / The Flash is the best comparison since SCP has a similar representation with SCP-682. 
    
As mentioned, in the Flash Forward run, Wally West obtains an amp in The Mobius Chair. 
    
in SCP, during the **Admonition** “run”, SCP-682 becomes a Constant by integrating into the cosmology. 
     
Both are examples of a character being taken out of their typical environment, and gaining a significant boost in power through a cosmic amp.  
    
Both are *also* examples of A character being represented differently, but still abiding by the same core concepts that comprise them. (Wally’s heroism, SCP-682’s hatred.) 
     
I’ve attached 8 Photos from the following page:   
https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/admonition   
    
This is the home page, and shows the chronology of The Admonition series. 
    
This is where the popular SCP-6820 comes from. This is also where SCP-6747 comes from. 
    
The attached photo after “Departmentalized”, is just a simple note explaining to those who are still unconvinced, that the articles in Admonition are a connected (canon to eachother) story told across multiple SCP entires and tale articles. 
Admonition Chronology: 
- Episode 1: SCP-6820. (SCP-682.)   
- Episode 2: SCP-6747. (SCP-2747.)    
- Episode 3: SCP-6659. (SCP-3125)     
- Episode 4: SCP-6488 
- Episode 5: SCP-6183        
- Episode 6: SCP-7243     
- Episode 7: SCP-8190      
     
This type of story telling is the same as DC, Marvel, and Image Comics. 
    
Establish a baseline. In Marvel/DC/Image, this is the universe that characters originate from. For SCP, that universe is just the initial SCP Entry. 
   
Alternate Versions, in the case of Comics, like Superman One Million, The Marquis of Death (Dr.Doom Variant), and Galactic Spider-Man, are simply explained as being from alternate timelines that branch from the baseline universe.    
     
Alternative Versions in SCP are treated the same. SCP tends to tell it’s stories while dabbling in **metafiction**, so while the alternate timeline explanation is common for some character variants like SCP-173 and SCP-049, some characters like SCP-3812, are explained to differ by continuity. This second explanation is effectively the same as the comic explanation when you understand that SCP’s cosmology in continuities that use this idea have **literal narratives** built into reality, that are capable of being effected by Swanns. 
    
Swanns are the Euronymous, The TOAA’s of SCP. They’re just a lot more involved, and used as the cause of differing variants. Often times, the difference in character by who is writing them is pointed out by the character themselves, hence the emphasis on SCP’s heavy use of Metafiction. 
    
Please, if you are still confused, comment your confusions and I can hopefully explain, or link you to pages that can explain everything you need to know in regards to SCP, and Continuity. 
    
I’m making this post because I love SCP. I’ve read it for close to 11 years now, and it’s a lot of fun to include the anomalous weirdness of SCP in powerscaling. 
   
I understand however that most of the powerscalers who like to use SCP do so in bad faith, to troll, or shut down any type of conversation. They’ve also hounded the authors on social media for clarification on statements that are intentionally open for interpretation given the nature of SCP.  
     
It’s sort of brewed into a toxic cesspool of people who always have to have a character who can one shot the other. No close fight, fun talk of tactics. Just, the scp one shots, and you’re stupid if you don’t agree. 
    
I hate those people, just as much as I do the people who spout that you can’t scale SCP. 
   
r/SCP has understandably distance themselves because at the end of the day, myself included, most who read SCP care more about the interesting science, mysterious anomalies, or any other aspect since SCP has so much to love about it besides powerscaling. Metafiction is inherently powerful, and SCP is heavily meta. It is simply a by-product that SCP is powerful. 
   
Hope this helps those confused about SCP’s continuity. No, not anyone can write it. Fred Jr. can’t create an SCP that’s just his OC Bob who solos fiction.

I decided I wanted to get healthy and I wanted to lose weight in January so I began going to my apartment gym and running for about 30 minutes 2 days on 1 day off. I got to the point where I decided to add maybe 10-15 minutes of lifting specific muscles at the end of my cardio. Then eventually cut cardio all together and started only lifting. I also was eating about only 1800 calories a day and quickly shot back down to 160 (probably about 18-19%bf just a guess)(could not even see my abs tho) by march and plateaud there. In late April I decided I wanted to join a real gym and really work on my physique, I started running a Jeff nippard upper lower split 4 days a week and quickly got frustrated that I wasn’t progressing in my lifts every week and wasn’t noticing any changes so I started eating more/bulking  in the middle of may (wasn’t tracking as intensely) cause I figured I’d be fine as long as I’m working my ass off in the gym and quickly have shot up to about 169-170 but am feeling stronger and progressing more than I ever have in my life.

I wasn’t home, so I wrote the OTP on a paper for my mom. She doesn’t know how these things work. The delivery guy came, asked for the OTP, and opened the box himself. Then he gave her the box with just one coffee packet inside.

My mom didn’t realize it was supposed to be two. Later I come home, check, and I’m like “wtf?” — it’s a combo, there should be two. I contact Flipkart, file complaint, even get a call from their social media team. They ask me for photos, which I sent. Still nothing.

I'm 100% sure the delivery guy took one packet. That’s straight up theft.

And this isn’t the first time it’s happened.

On Zepto, I ordered two biscuit packs once. The delivery guy came, I saw both packs in his bag. He gave me the bag and dipped. I go inside — only one pack inside. I called him — he cut the call. I complained to Zepto and they gave me a refund. At least they did something.

People aren’t always home

Family members won’t check the order properly

Apps will take forever to do anything

I’m unsure how to gauge my recovery progress because I’m still unemployed and managing day-to-day. I became ill right away but unfortunately took a total of 6 pills before stopping the prescription. About two months in, NSAIDs caused a significant flare-up, making symptoms much worse. Since then, I’ve had only one episode of intense anxiety around 9 months post-exposure, which lasted about a month. My tendonitis symptoms are sporadic and don’t seem related to activity levels or proportional to my movement.  I have days where it feels a little less dark or more normal and I keep going.  I am able to ride my stationary bike at 150bpm for 45 minutes every other day.  I also do DDP yoga a couple times a week.

***Things that have improved:***

Right leg achilles pain is not as bad, somedays doesn't hurt at all.  It initially would throb and was comparable in pain to post op shoulder surgery.  The burning that I had in the leg has been gone since the first two months.  I have a rule, when i'm standing and it starts to hurt, I sit down.

Tachycardia and irregular heartbeat, went away after first few months.

Bottom of both feet still hurt, but not as much as they used to when standing.

Both thumbs have calmed down, not as much pain or tingling.  Right thumb inflammation just went away one day about two weeks ago.  I couldn't grip things with my left thumb palm side without extreme pain and it would tingle constantly.  I also couldn't bent my right thumb without snapping and pain.  I wasn't even able to touch the thumb joint without extreme pain.  They were both like that for over a year.  I hope they stay this way.

The pain that was in my ribcage and around into my back has gone away.

Anxiety has episodes but nowhere near as intense and prolonged as it was before.  It was intense 24 hours a day for a few months initially.

I can do light weight lifting and my shoulders have strength again.  I have to be careful at the angles I have my wrist flexed at while pushing or pulling this can hurt in what i suspect are the tendon sheaths.

The skin around my eyes has calmed down but I am required to put Eucerin on the area.  If I were to rub them the skin would blister/split initially.  They are still susceptible to this but not as much.

Bloodshot right eye with pain behind it.  This randomly still happens but it's just the pain and it's not like it was.  The used to also water profusely.

I don't have the rash on my scalp like I did, much less and not as noticeable.  There were kinda like really itchy zits.  If I scratch my scalp it reappears mildly.

The lines on my nails have cleared up and my skin isn't splitting easily on my finger tips around the nail beds.

Popping tendons/joints.  I have it in my neck, shoulders, ankles, feet, chest, jaw, wrists.  I know it's different because the pitch of the popping or cracking is different than it was preflox.  It's also more constant than it would be before the abx.  This has calmed down a bit since the start but it's still there.

***Things that have remained the same:***

Red inflamed gums that bleed easily when brushing, flossing, eating.  It's not every time, but it sure is often.  They also will hurt and ache.  I suspect this inflammation is related in someway to the fissure I developed as well.  It's a similar thing with any kind of impact and there's bleeding.  I have had to take Miralax daily to get this under control.  I also take Metamucil.  Both of these issues are not normal for me and happened after the floxing.

Vision issues, hard to explain but it's not quite right.  Visual snow I can see in pitch black and some image burn in.  I also have alot of floaters that i didn't notice like I do now.

Tinnitus, woof.  I had it before flox but this is worse.

Insomnia, comes and goes.

Skin a bit wrinkly.

Brainfog it's pretty weird.  Something about the buzzing ears, slight depersonalization, vision issues, and impaired cognitive function really seem interconnected.  The anxiety has gone which is great but these CNS issues are challenging.  It's the main culprit of ""somethings still not right"".  Somedays I can totally ignore it if i'm busy but it's always there.

***I haven't had any immediate issues or reactions with the following :***

GTN / Nitroglycerin ointment

Zoloft (daily)

Ativan (as needed sparingly maybe 30 pills over the last 18 months)

Tylenol

Alka Seltzer Severe Cold and Flu

MRI Contrast Gadolinium

Fluoride

THC (daily after stopping cold turkey for 9 months due to flox concerns)

Coffee (one cup daily after stopping for 9 months see above)

***My current stack is :***

ALA, NAC, Probiotic, CoQ10, Perfect Amino, astaxanthin, Whey powder, Multivitamin, Omega 3, Mag L-Threonate, Collagen gummies, Collagen powder, Taurine

I slowly added these one by one each week to figure out if I was reacting to them.  I did not agree with any form of Magnesium besides threonate.  They all caused intense anxiety, this was preflox as well.  I also didn't like L-theanine or melatonin and how they made me feel.

I saw a hematologist, and a rheumatologist.  The hematologist found no bleeding issues.  I tested positive for a few things on my AVISE CTD test but overall was found to be negative for lupus.  Running my results through ai leans more towards Sjogrens but I have no issues with dry mouth or eyes.  The elevated numbers are only slightly elevated too like just over.

I'm writing this for anyone following my story, and for anyone searching certain keywords regarding medicines or symptoms.

Tired of this online scam shit.,"I ordered Continental XTRA Instant Coffee (2 x 200g combo) from Flipkart — supposed to be 2 packets, right? Guess what? Only 1 came.

I wasn’t home, so I wrote the OTP on a paper for my mom. She doesn’t know how these things work. The delivery guy came, asked for the OTP, and opened the box himself. Then he gave her the box with just one coffee packet inside.

My mom didn’t realize it was supposed to be two. Later I come home, check, and I’m like “wtf?” — it’s a combo, there should be two. I contact Flipkart, file complaint, even get a call from their social media team. They ask me for photos, which I sent. Still nothing.

I'm 100% sure the delivery guy took one packet. That’s straight up theft.

And this isn’t the first time it’s happened.

On Zepto, I ordered two biscuit packs once. The delivery guy came, I saw both packs in his bag. He gave me the bag and dipped. I go inside — only one pack inside. I called him — he cut the call. I complained to Zepto and they gave me a refund. At least they did something.

I’m starting to feel like this is becoming a pattern. These delivery guys know:

People aren’t always home

Family members won’t check the order properly

Apps will take forever to do anything


And so they pull this shit. What pisses me off more is how slow Flipkart is. If I hadn’t kept following up, they’d have done nothing.

Trying to **burn fat and build muscle at the same time** feels like wanting cake and abs. You’re either starving or losing strength, and honestly? No one signed up for that.

You drop a few pounds, but suddenly your arms look like linguine. Emotionally, it’s frustrating. Physically, it’s just... flat. You want to lean out, not waste away.

That’s why [Anabolic Fasting](https://theworldhealth.org/anabolic-fasting-official) got my attention. It’s a plan that lets you keep your muscle while burning fat, *without* eating six times a day or giving up carbs forever.

# 📦 Product Overview

**Product Name:** Anabolic Fasting  
**Category:** Nutrition ➝ Body Recomposition Diets  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.7/5

# 📘 What Is Anabolic Fasting?

Brad Pilon—fitness coach and probable avocado enthusiast—designed **Anabolic Fasting** to combine **intermittent fasting and muscle gain** with **low-carb eating** and carb refeed weekends.

You eat in a **16:8 intermittent fasting** window. During the week, carbs stay low, fat goes up, and protein keeps your muscles happy. On weekends? Carbs return like a food-loving ex.

It's a mix of **structured carb cycling meal plans** and strategic timing. Basically, it flips your body between fat-burning and muscle-support modes—no wizardry needed.

# ⏰ How It Works: Weekly Format Explained

Here’s the routine: Monday through Friday, you eat low-carb, high-fat meals inside your eating window. **Fasting methods that don’t cause muscle loss** are rare, but this pulls it off.

Saturday and Sunday become **beneficial refeed days**. That’s when your body soaks up carbs, refills glycogen, and gets primed for growth instead of going limp like overcooked tofu.

This **carb cycling to lose fat and gain muscle** helps avoid energy crashes, preserves strength, and gives your workouts an actual purpose beyond survival.

# 🧬 Fat Loss Without Muscle Loss: The Science Bit

During the fasting period, insulin drops and your body taps into fat stores. Then, your refeed restores energy and keeps **testosterone and growth hormones** humming along.

You’re now using **an anabolic-style diet for body recomposition**. One that triggers fat loss while protecting lean muscle—no extreme calorie cuts or dangerous gimmicks.

Unlike crash diets, this **weight loss plan preserves muscle**. Your [metabolism stays intact](https://theworldhealth.org/anabolic-fasting-official), your gym progress doesn’t vanish, and you actually look stronger—because you are.

# 👥 Who Is This For?

If you’re training hard but still struggling to **burn fat while maintaining muscle**, this is probably for you. Especially if you're over macro-counting and food scales.

Busy schedules, work stress, and lifting don’t always blend. This plan fits a wide range of people, from gym rats to weekend warriors trying to **lean out while staying strong**.

Even **cutting fat while keeping your muscle** becomes manageable. Just prep your meals, drink your water, and avoid weekend donut spirals (unless they’re planned, of course).

# 📣 Real Results: What People Are Saying

People in fitness forums rave about this plan. One guy claimed **before and after results from Anabolic Fasting** helped him finally see his abs without feeling like he was in boot camp.

Others love the **recomposition results with intermittent fasting**. They’re dropping fat and noticing better definition in their shoulders, arms, and midsection.

There are mentions of improved energy, easier digestion, and *less guilt*. Especially since weekend carbs feel like a reward, not a cheat. It feels balanced, not extreme.

# 🧪 Tanya’s Experience

One of my close yoga clients, **Tanya D**, is a 38-year-old spin instructor I met at a weekend wellness retreat in Ojai. We bonded over our love for plant-based snacks and our mutual obsession with leg day.

Tanya's a total powerhouse—but even she was struggling to balance her muscle tone with her nutrition plan. She’d vent during our chats about how every time she cut calories, her quads seemed to vanish right along with the belly fluff.

So, she [gave Anabolic Fasting a try](https://theworldhealth.org/anabolic-fasting-official)—mostly because she loved the idea of structure without micromanaging every meal.

Tanya followed the **16:8 intermittent fasting** window, trained five days a week (with my workouts on Tuesdays and Thursdays!), and was surprisingly consistent with her low-carb meals during the week.

By week three, she looked noticeably tighter—her words, not mine—and said she felt more focused during her morning classes.

The refeed days became her favorite part of the plan (she lovingly dubbed Saturdays “Sweet Potato Day”), and she actually looked forward to them instead of dreading diet fatigue.

Her only gripe? The weekday meals got boring fast, especially since she doesn’t love eggs. She got a little creative with tofu and zucchini noodles, but still missed variety.

Still, she stuck with it for six weeks, lost about 9 pounds of body fat, and gained visible definition in her arms and shoulders.

Tanya told me this was the first time she felt like she could **build muscle while burning fat** without feeling like she had to choose one over the other. And coming from someone who lives in Lycra and teaches three spin classes a day? That’s saying something.

A few examples;

* Wegmans REFUSES to expand here. A spokeswoman has plainly said; ""we're not interested"". And of course they favor New England, over us. And IT'S NOT because of Price Chopper!
* Chik Fil-A. It's taken -- how many years? - for them to build a self-standing restaurant outside of Albany airport. I hope the reception to them here is favorable.
* Shake Shack. They've announced they're coming... but AFTER locations in western NY have already proven successful. Sorry; I forgot about the ""seasonal"" operation at the Saratoga race course.
* Krispy Kreme Donuts. Like them? Hate them? Obviously it didn't work here. The company opened ONE store in Latham, back in 2004!! - which was closed by 2006!
* Tim Horton's (Canadian coffee/donut shop). Been popular in Canada for 50 years. Rapidly expanded in the US during the 80's - 2000. No locations ever in Albany-proper that I'm aware of. But they built some stores in eastern New England instead. (unfortunately they've since closed the MA stores)
* Costco. Only recently have they expressed an interest in the area...only to have received backlash from nearby residents.
* Finally.... ShopRite. Loved them when they were here!!! -- TWICE -- and I'm sure they don't think ""3 times is the charm"". No chance they'll be back, but of course, downstate, they're everywhere!

These are the examples I'm most familiar with. Any others??

1lb162v,https://v.redd.it/n3jre1i0yt6f1,Leaky espresso machine [Delonghi La Specialista Arte],"Hey! Any help would be appreciated!

I got a second hand Delonghi La Specialista (no cold brew) espresso machine from my mom since she wanted to upgrade to the Breville one that does the tamping for you with a lever since she’s getting older, but still loves herself a good cup of coffee. 😂

She has kept it in tip top shape and is always on time on descaling the machine and it was fine when I got it. I also kept it in the same descaling/cleaning schedule as she kept it.

But recently, I notice that when I pull a shot, it doesn’t give me enough water to pull either a single or double shot. The most I’ll get is maybe 5-10g of water. I’d have to pull at least 2-3 times to be able to get the right amount. Instead, it starts leaking from underneath and on the sides of the machine under the drip the tray. I asked my dad to make a base so I can have a separate drip tray so we’re not flooding, but it still doesn’t solve the problem of it leaking at the sides. It’s still dripping from underneath the machine as well but that’s where a good amount of water comes out too.

It leaks as well when I use the steamer. And the hands of the temperature/pressure control dial does not move at all when I pull a shot. It stays at the starting point.

I’m at loss for words because I don’t even want to use it anymore because I feel like I have to spend time cleaning up after a flood instead of enjoying my coffee.

Also unsure if it’s worth it to get this fixed or just get a new one all together if the price to get it fixed is going to be roughly the same as a new machine.

And in regard to warranty questions, I’m unsure when my mom bought it and it may be way past the warranty timespan since she’s had it for 2 years before she gave it to me and I’ve had it for 1.5 years after receiving it from her.

I used ai’s help to articulate this well. Long post.

Hi everyone,

I’m 30F, 130kg (286 lbs), 5’3”, and on a mission to lose weight—not just for looks, but because my health depends on it. I’ve been doing this seriously for the past 10 days and I’m not seeing any change. Not on the scale, not in measurements. I’m hoping someone here can help me figure out what’s going on.



What I’m Doing:

	•	Walking: 45 minutes a day

	•	Core strengthening: 20 minutes a day

	•	Full-time mom: Taking care of my 16-month-old (which is a workout in itself!)

	•	Breastfeeding

	•	Tracking intake: Averaging around 1900 calories per day

	•	CICO focus: I’m trying to stay in a consistent calorie deficit




My “Flaws”:

	•	I have coffee/tea 3x a day, each with milk and ~20g total of jaggery for the whole day

	•	I haven’t cut carbs completely (but I eat within my calorie limit)

	•	I had one cheat day in the last 10 days

	•	Occasionally have a sweet or indulgence maybe twice a week




What’s Bugging Me:

	•	No weight loss at all in 10 days. Not even a little.

	•	No inch loss that I can notice either

	•	I’ve been consistent, motivated, and realistic—no extreme fad stuff

	•	I’m doing my best with limited time and energy (hello, mom life)


I know 10 days isn’t a lot in the grand scheme of things, but with this much effort, I expected at least something—even 0.5kg or just feeling slightly leaner. I’m doing the work, and the scale not moving feels so defeating.


What am I doing wrong? What should I tweak?


Is my calorie estimate too high for my weight? Should I cut sugar entirely? Is breastfeeding making it weird? Water retention from exercise?

I’m open to any advice, suggestions, or even just support. Please help this girl out.

	•	I’m doing my best with limited time and energy (hello, mom life)


I know 10 days isn’t a lot in the grand scheme of things, but with this much effort, I expected at least something—even 0.5kg or just feeling slightly leaner. I’m doing the work, and the scale not moving feels so defeating.


What am I doing wrong? What should I tweak?


Is my calorie estimate too high for my weight? Should I cut sugar entirely? Is breastfeeding making it weird? Water retention from exercise?

I’m open to any advice, suggestions, or even just support. Please help this girl out.

I am a 30 y/o F, who lives with her 50 y/o mom. We have always been close, and my mom has recently been sober for 8 months (im extremely proud of her). That being said, about 2 years ago (2023), my mom had a late night and drunkly walked to get food from a restaurant not far from our (then) house. There were 2 homeless men that set up camp at a neighboring business. She went over and sat in the middle of their camp and started talking to them. They shared alcohol and chatted all night. The next morning, a now sober mom walks into the house to make coffee for the 3 of them and asked if I could help bring out the cups and meet her new friends. I helped and chatted to be nice and didn't think anything of it. Until a few days later, one of them, let's call him man(36 y/o), started staying the night. I was very uneasy because he was a literal stranger, and we knew nothing about him. Im also shy and have a hard time trusting people due to her having an extremely toxic relationship with my step dad of 21 years, which ended because he died the previous October. Man was quiet and polite at first, but then he and mom started gradually started getting drunk most nights, and both are mean drunks, so there were lots of arguments. It even got physical, and he went to jail for battery against my mom at one point. He stole money from her and told her it was her fault he stole and he wouldn't have had to steal had she just given him the money for alcohol. He was constantly being kicked out or leaving to go sleep in the streets. He is so addicted to alcohol he will have seizures if sober toi long. This went on for about 9-10 months in this house. In March the following year (2024), we had to move rather quickly into a new home. I was asked how I felt about him signing the lease, I said I didn't want him to for all the reasons mentioned and to the fact he had no job with no aspiration to get one, but ultimately agreed in the end. The whole cycle started again, but this time he literally stayed drunk 24/7 for the whole month of July, where he stole, berated her, fought with both of us, created messes, was constantly lon and off living on the streets, and talked bad about us to an old ex who worked with my mom and made it a hostile environment and another lady who messaged my mom calling her a pedophile, a b-word, and more. He never took responsibility for any of it. It got so bad that O was aked to change to door knob to my moms room to one with a key so he would stay out of her stuff and my mom filed a restraining order (she now tells me she feels like I and few friend made her feel pressured) and it was granted, meaning g he wasn't allowed within 500 ft of her, her house, and her job. She still allowed him to be around. The cycle still continued, but it never got to that level. My mom got him a good job with a friend of hers, and man showed up drunk the second day and was asked not to come back. Man blames that on my mom. Fast forward to June 2025. She's been sober since October, and he's still in and out. Still drunk, high, or both. Still causing problems. There have been days he entered the house without us being there  and been caught sleeping on the floor and quickly ran out of the house when we caught him. There have been times he's entered the house with us there with no invitation. I am now paranoid of him being there when I come home for lunch. I have told mom this, I have told her I do not feel comfortable in our house because of him and that I did not want to live with him. He has gone to AA with her, but has no plans to stop drinking ( he's admitted this) My mom has made it clear solhe does not want him drinking or drunk at the house due ti her sobriety. I will admit I have been mean recently, not talking to him, and even being upset and cold with mom for letting him back again, so I'll fully admit I'm the ass for that. I recently went to a friend's house and when I got back, mom asked if I wanted to go hang out with a few of her friends (ive hung out with them before and like them), her, and man. I told her no. She asked if it was because man was going and I told her yes. She got upset. I told her I hated him and wanted nothing to do with him. She said I've said that about step dad (i did)."" He says that because of me, she can't have boyfriends unless I approve of them. She also said she feels like I've been talking about moving out, I told her I've thought about it because I want peace and I never got that with stepdad and I don't get it with man. I have talked about moving out before both in fights and not, but neither of us can afford being on our own. She also keeps bringing up a friend I've had since highschool she disliked, saying she's never liked her but dealt with her (my mom's made it very clear many times she doesn't like her to the point my friend knows without me telling her)I'll admit my friend can be abrasive and is very opionated. I told her her bringing her up is getting old, and she's allowed to not like her as im allowed to not like man. She told me that I said I hated step-dad and only started caring when he died. He cause a lot of turmoil, too, was in and out, and was abusive at times.  She also compared me to her abusive mother and my abusive dad, saying I was just like them, not the first time she told me that. My mom also said that I'd rather see her homeless than happy. She made man leave and asked if I was happy. I said not, really. She keeps telling me I threatened to move out, I just told you I'd thought about it. She says she's lonely and she doesn't doesn't want to be lonely like I am. I am not a saint, I have been cold to her for keeping on letting man back in, I have not been very nice to man (though I do cook dinner for all three of us when he's here). This all stemmed from me saying I didn't want to go hang out if he was going to be there. I didn't want to start an argument. I feel like shit for making my mom cry and hurting her. I do actually feel bad for her kicking him out, I don't wish man ill, I just don't want to deal with the bs anymore. 
Also, I know addiction isn't easy. I've watched it, I've seen how people act, but I'm tired of watching it. I've dealt with it my entire life.

I took the pill as soon as possible which was around 7pm and had no problems at all that night. Woke up with my face swollen which I have alot of reactions normally so I didn’t think much of it. I took two Benadryl and another Augmentin. Took a nap and my face was horribly swollen and full of hives but they stopped at my neck which was odd to me like a solid line almost of hives. Went and had coffee with my bf and he strongly advised that I go to the er because it was getting much worse in just 20 min. Went in to the er as my throat was getting tight and almost full of mucus. Went in they gave me an epi pen and a some blockers. I had started using adapalene gel that night but I had previously gone through many tubes a few months ago and wanted to try it again. I told them this and they said it wouldn’t cause my throat to swell but very weird that I only had hives on my face and the hives stopped at my neck.

1lb0y7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1lb0y7r/mr_gwumpy_pants_is_gwumpy_again/,Mr Gwumpy Pants is Gwumpy again,"I have a roommate,T. I wonder when he’s going to commit suicide. T is clearly miserable. He works for the fire department here in Cordova and it is driving him insane, and everyone knows it but him.

I say good morning to him every morning. He grunts in response if he responds at all. I eventually give up on saying good morning to him. T has moments where he’s almost cool, nearly enjoyable, but then he ruins it by being a little rain cloud so much of the time. He stomps around the apartment, he slams doors, and he is clearly miserable.

At first, I assume it’s me that is pissing him off so badly. But he was very welcoming after I first got to Alaska. He offered me instant coffee. He made me a cup of tea. One day, he and I met at the museum and later walked along the tide break in the harbor. But then the next day I say good morning to him and he grunts at the eggs he’s cooking.

It is not humanly possible to placate T’s neuroses. I’m not a psychologist, nor any other kind of mental health professional, but I have two eyes and two ears, and a brain between them. T has something wrong with his brain. I don’t know what, but I know that he cleaned the same load of dishes in the dishwasher three times. As the third time finished, I figured, okay, I’m going to help him out and put the clean dishes away. T runs out of his room saying “Are you putting the dirty dishes away?” 

T throws half the kitchen into the dishwasher. Some of these spoons are getting washed in the dishwasher for the fourth time. He cleans like a man possessed. T cleans like he believes the KGB will murder his family if he doesn’t vacuum the couch. He comes home one day and sets to bleaching the outside of his chest freezer. He’s the only one who touches his chest freezer. He says and I quote “I’m a neat freak and a germ freak.”

I’m no psychologist, but I see a compulsion. He tells me he’s worried about getting sick from dirty dishes. He has three half-gallons of heavy whipping cream that are at least two months past their use by date. I want to tell him that he’s worried about the wrong germs and that he’s going to give himself listeria. 

But mostly, I want to tell T to quit his job and lighten up. He is miserable to be around. I don’t think he has any friends. I’m absolutely certain he’s never had sex with a woman. I have to remind myself that having sex is not how a human being derives their value, but it is low hanging fruit. When T is being a grouch, In my mind I pretend that I call him out on being a 30 year old virgin. Sometimes I imagine myself calling him out on being a closeted homosexual. I know this is wrong. He’s clearly a closeted homosexual, but calling him out on it would probably only hasten his suicide. I say nothing.

I take to calling him Mr. Gwumpy Pants under my breath. Aw, Mr. Gwumpy Pants had someone piss in his cheerios this morning didn’t he? Does Mr. Gwumpy Pants need a diaper change? Is this that so called toxic masculinity? Yes, probably. I know my reaction should be along the lines of “hey man, I had a lot of benefits from therapy and you probably would too” but my impulse in my own private thoughts is, “toughen up buttercup.” Every interaction I have with T makes me less and less charitable toward him.

One night T comes out of his room to tell me my laptop is loud. He doesn’t ask me to turn the volume down. He makes a statement that it’s loud. I turn it down to placate him. There is nothing humanly possible to placate this person. I should have told him, “That was a statement, what was your question?”

I hate passive aggression. I really don’t like T at this point, but he still deserves the minimum level of respect that all humans deserve. He does not make this easy. I wonder if he has autism and I’m just being a dick. Then, just when I’m in a charitable mood to give T the benefit of the doubt, he starts banging the vacuum into my bedroom wall. I want to ask him when he’s going to have sex with a woman. I bite my tongue. I leave on my trusty dirtbike piggy and go to the store. I didn’t even want to buy anything at the store, I just wanted to be away from T for a minute while he vacuumed the couch like his mom’s life depended on it.

Speaking as someone who was a firefighter and has also extensively contemplated suicide, T is fucked unless he starts intensive therapy immediately. I will try to keep the common areas of our apartment clean but I will not cater to his untreated compulsions. Sorry you had to see some dust, you live next to a gravel pit, get over it.

I don’t want T to commit suicide. I want him to lighten up and be happy. I just refuse to be surprised when he does the former instead of the latter. And frankly for me in my day to day life, the vibe in the apartment would be the same regardless of which he chooses. I wouldn’t bother with going to his funeral.

T walks out of the bathroom. I guess the microwave wasn’t closed all the way. He slams the microwave door shut and goes into his bedroom without a word. I pity him. I know how miserable it is to be that pissed off all the time. I try to not to cheer for his suicide but I wish he would go away. His problems are his problems and I wish he would stop making them my problems. I am out of sympathy at this point. Your mental health isn’t your fault but it is your responsibility. He owes it to everyone who cares about him to attend anger management classes but he doesn’t do that. 

T sucks. I hope he knows he sucks because not knowing he sucks makes me even less charitable to his struggles. Mr. Gwumpy Pants is gwumpy again. I’m so sowwy that other people’s existences piss him off so badly but I just think Mr. Gwumpy Pants needs some talcum powder on his chapped ass. Either that or he can go fuck himself. Actually he can just fuck himself anyway and then wonder why he doesn’t have any friends. (hint: it’s because he's the type of person who slams the microwave door and then slams your bedroom door). Like Jesus Fucking Christ I remember being a moody teenager but we’re both in our thirties. Figure your shit out dude because I’m not going to do it for you.

That was it, I couldn’t take it anymore. All of the classes and the words and the work; I realized that it wasn’t what I wanted it to be. I realized that not everyone is cut out for school, even if you really think you are. I didn’t go home, at least not yet. I stayed in the city, renting out an old basement suite and working a shit nine-to-five at the college convenience store. I lost my motivation and I had simply given up. If I couldn’t be a computer scientist or a video game developer or even a mere student, then I would slide smoothly into the stereotype I was already blossoming into: a college dropout nobody. 

I was drained. I had taken the blame. I drank, I smoked and I spent most of my days off at the nearest bar, drowning my hopes and dreams with every drink I consumed. 

I wasn’t at all who I’d hoped to become, and I just kept feeding into the nothingness that surrounded me. 

	If manifestation can bring your dreams into reality, then the opposite can be true. Self doubt is a powerful drug and it was all I was able to take. 

No one called me, not even Caleb. I continued to lie to my parents and tell them that I was going back to school in the fall and that I was just so busy in the city. The only thing I didn’t do was make up a fake girlfriend, but I was on the verge of it.



One night at the old college bar, I sat at the end of a booth with my head in my arms. I felt just like some washed up movie character with my hair hanging low and an uneven stubble growing across my jaw. Acne had riddled my face and I was becoming unrecognizable from the clean faced, overly excited kid I was when I’d left that town. 

That town. I thought about it a lot, almost too much. The cries of Alison’s mother at her funeral were like audible hallucinations that I couldn’t shake. I’d looked her in the eye once or twice at the wake and each time I did, I can remember the most agonizing guilt punching me in the stomach. 

That night I was humming to myself, my hand around my next round of beer. 

“I’m so sorry I’m so sorry….” Was all I could get out through my drunken stupor. 



“Kurt?” My head shot up when I heard my name. My vision was blurred but I could see someone standing in front of me. They slipped onto the stool to my right and kept their concerned gaze on me. It was Bradley, a friend from my old computer science class. He looked too put together to be here, or at least to be seen with me. He looked scared, or disappointed. Both. His hands were wrapped tightly around a can of Bohemian and his legs were crossed.

“Brad.” I mumbled back half-heartedly. His expression grew deeper, more concentrated.

“How…have you been, buddy?”

“Next question.” I snorted and shot myself a smirk, pleased with my quick response. I brought the rim of the mug to my mouth and chugged about half of my beer, burping so hard it was painful. I could feel poor old Brad’s posture stiffen.

“How….er….what have you been up to lately?” 

I just shook my head at this question. I was looking straight ahead at the giant mirror behind the bar. Between the dozens of unopened bottles and decorations, I could see my own reflection. It made me sick and I almost threw up right there and then, but I suppressed it. Then I looked over at Brad’s reflection and paused.

His curly black hair and glasses were all in the right place; he was fixed so still and so certain that he almost looked like a statue. I looked like a monster.

Then I stopped to examine his reflection a little deeper and noticed that he wasn’t moving at all. Not even breathing. And he was staring right at me. I turned to look at him slowly. There he was, staring and not moving an inch. His fingers didn’t stir, his button-up shirt didn’t rise or fall. He was a carving, just…staring and not speaking. I looked into his eyes.

“Brad….?”

Nothing. I poked him and he felt like brick. My heart thudded. This went on for nearly a minute before he finally let something out. These words sent me back almost three years:

“You don’t have anything to eat, do you?”

	With those words I could feel a panic attack on the rise. I clutched my chest and stared at him with newly widened eyes. Then he snapped back out of it.

“What, are you okay? Hey, Kurt, what’s…”

He reached out his hand. He was acting as if nothing had happened, like he didn’t just go full psycho on me. How did he know what to say to scare me so bad? Why would he do that? Did he even do that? Was I going insane? That had to be it.



I got the hell outta dodge. I was back at my place in no time and once I laid in my bed I realized I hadn’t paid my tab. Oh, well.

I was going crazy, hallucinating. I wondered if alcohol can make you see or hear things. Maybe Bradly wasn’t even there. His words stunned me to my very core. I could only remember that man-thing in the woods that night all those years ago, that voice and that terror that had gripped me. I shut my eyes tightly as I lay in my bed and as everything was spinning around me, I was made aware of one thing: That old town is coming back to haunt me…or worse. 



	I was nearing my last straw when I’d come to work hungover again. It was early fall and what was meant to be my second year in school was just beginning. I didn’t want to think about it. 

My head was spinning as I clocked in and leaned over the counter, looking across the store at all of the canned goods, drink machines and the like. My eyes latched onto a can opener on one of the cheap plastic shelves, sitting beside a few cans of beans. I almost scoffed, but instead my throat closed up on itself and I could feel something bubbling up inside of my head…tears. I was about to cry and I had to turn quickly away from the sales floor. 

I leaned backwards now, with my eyes now set on a poster behind the counter. It pictured a college student standing with books in hand, grinning wildly. I grunted and stooped into the break room where my boss was sitting. He didn’t look up, he only lifted a finger from the binder he was going through.

“Kurt,” He started in his grumbly voice. I froze.

“You fucked up again, kid.”

I didn’t say anything.

“I thought we talked…you can’t keep coming in here clinging to dear life.”

Then he looked up at me and grimaced.

“Jesus, Kurtis, you’re not even trying anymore, are you? Shit, what even happened?”

I looked away to try and hide my disheveled appearance. 

“I…uh…I’m sorry, it won’t ha--”

“Yes, it will. It’s gonna keep happening until you’re dead in the ground with a rotten liver, just like ol’ pop-pop.”

I couldn’t respond to that. 

“Fuck, don’t just stand there like a lost dog, go home. I don’t wanna see you until you look halfway sober. Hell, I can’t even recognize you anymore.”

I didn’t have anything else to say or do, so I left. I went back to my miserable apartment and sulked. I poured myself a couple of shots and I was out like a light.

	But the phone rang. It must have been going for a while by the time I opened my eyes. I was laying on my couch in my own filth, but it didn’t faze me anymore. Somehow I’d stopped even caring how any of this made me feel. 

I grabbed around on the coffee table until I found my phone and mindlessly answered it.

“Mmm…hello?”

My voice was shot.

“Kurt?” 

Caleb’s voice was like a terrible, beautiful song to my ears.

“Oh, hey, man.” I sat up slowly, clutching the back of the couch.

“Are you…doin’ okay, man?”

“Uh, yeah, yeah. I’m just…tired from uh…studying.” 

There was a pause and I had the horrible feeling that Caleb knew I was bullshitting him. He was always smart about that stuff.

“Don’t lie to me, Kurt. It’s fine, I get it. I was never good with school, either. You remember.”

He chuckled softly and I felt a short burst of elation from his words. Someone was finally understanding.

“Anyway, don’t explain. I have something important to tell you.”

I was all ears. It seemed as if Caleb’s voice had shaken me out of whatever stupor I was in and I was instantly intrigued.

“I did it.”

Was all he said at first. I wasn’t sure what he meant for exactly two seconds, but then, in the pause between words, I completely understood.

“No.”

“Yes.”

“Oh.”

More silence. Time was frozen. I could only wonder how he pulled this off. Into The Wild.

“I don’t know, man. It’s nice. I mean, of course it is, this is what I was made for.”

“You’re in Salmon Challis?”

I asked quickly.

“Where else?” His voice was upbeat and almost whimsical. 

“How long…”

“I’m not ever going back. I’m not, don’t even ask me. I can’t even tell you how good this feels.”

“So…why are you calling me…?”

“Because I need you.”

I scoffed.

“You…need me?”

“Yes, I need you.”

His voice started cutting out.

“There’s bad reception out here but when this call is up I’m destroying this phone.”

His words shocked me to my core. I was lost, confused, and terrified. He sounded so serious about it, so certain. I should have known he wasn’t done with his outdoors shit, how could he be? It was always a part of him.

“Okay, what do you need from me?”

“I need you to help me. I know this is a big ask but I wouldn’t call if I didn’t think you could do it.”

“Help with…?”

“Supplies, food. Preservations, you know. You wouldn’t have to leave the city, you could just…come out every few months and bring me stuff. Of course I’ll be moving camp every so often so I’m not discovered, but…this is the only way I know how to do this, and you’re my best friend. Put it this way, you’ll be saving my life. Keeping me safe. Feeding me.” He paused for just a moment and added, 

“You’ll take the main hiking trail up to Red Rock Point. There’s an abandoned ranger’s cabin at the top of the hill from there.”



I hung up after giving him a short, ‘I’ll think about it.’

And I did. I couldn’t stop thinking about it, actually. I didn’t go to work the next day, or for my next scheduled shift. As far as I was concerned, I could be fired and tossed into the fiery depths. I was done with this city, this sad and pathetic attempt at a life I sought before my overpowering guilt and self pity took hold. 

That call is what really sent the rest of my life in motion. I wasn’t old, I wasn’t even close. I was a broke, drunken twenty one year old with nowhere to go and this magical voice from years past had just asked me to ‘save his life,’ as he put it. At the time I hadn’t even thought about the odd part at the end of our conversation, where he’d added a second time that I would feed him.

It knew he wasn’t coming home, I knew I could never ask him to and I also knew that I couldn’t let his parents know.

Of course, a part of me thought for the next while or so that I should let the Marshs’ know where he had gone, but another part of me, the part that loved Caleb and explored with him for most of my life, that I could not let him down. I couldn’t let anyone else down again. This was my chance at redemption, my chance at moving forward and at trying something new.

I left the city that week.



The last thing I wanted to do was come clean to my parents. They had been under the impression that I was still doing well. When they called I would tell them that I was enjoying school and that everything was fine. I’d even added details about the girls I’d seen in my classes or at parties and when they responded with such excitement I became too trapped in their manufactured pride in their only son that I just didn’t have the heart to let them down.

At this point, I knew I had to say something.

	When I’d gotten onto the bus headed home with all of my belongings, I didn’t even turn around one last time to say goodbye to the city. I wasn’t too entirely attached to care if I never saw it again. 

The leaves were just beginning to leave the trees and with my head against the cold window, I watched the world pass by me and tried not to think of the little town that was quickly approaching with unwavering arms. 

Of course I didn’t tell anyone I was leaving, I couldn’t have my parents freaking out about their poor son falling off the wagon. Still, I wasn’t sure how I would approach the subject once I’d made it home.



	I decided to stage a visit. If I was going to lie to a degree such as this, I might as well go all or nothing. As the bus weaved through the little town, I gazed around at all of the familiar surroundings. The fishing shop, the local goods and the little brick library were almost comforting to me if it wasn’t for my impending circumstance. I began kicking myself for not planning this out better. I could have told them I was coming home to visit, or anything like that but it was too late now.

I walked quickly through the bus terminal and around the corners until I reached my neighborhood. With my bags in hand and my face bare in the brisk autumn wind, I set forth to my demise.



I rang the doorbell once and my other came crashing through the door, calling my father to come outside. She must not have seen the state I was in when she hugged me tightly, and I loosely wrapped my arms around her back. My father walked through the corridor and up to the doorframe, his face almost dropping when he’d seen me. He must have taken notice fairly quickly of my appearance and I could see something in his eyes that I’d always feared: disappointment. 



	I ended up staying for dinner and talking half-heartedly about my college escapades, all the while my mother kept close and tender eyes on me. I hated lying to her. I told them I was just visiting and that it was my weekend off. I didn't say a word about Caleb or the things that I’d left behind in the big city. As far as they knew I was going right back to school after my surprise visit.



Friday into Saturday I layed low. I decided to stay for the weekend, telling them both that I would be heading back into the city early Monday morning. I wasn’t sure what I was going to do when that time came, but I couldn’t think that far ahead.

My mom went to work and my dad was busy with his hardware job. I was packing everything I could into my suitcase, trying to find every little thing I needed to give to Caleb out there in the woods. A pillow, a hunting knife, cans of soup and beans, socks, scarves, gloves and, to top it all off, a can opener.

I was ready by the time Monday morning graced me with its heat through my window. When I was laying in bed I almost felt like a child again, waiting for another big adventure with Caleb the madman. For a moment, I was thirteen and nervous. My stubble which was threatening to grow into something more questionable was simply a phantom sensation on my face, and my heavy mind felt lighter the more I indulged in this fantasy. 

But, as I was sitting up and gathering my things to head up into the forest behind our little town, my father came into the room. He looked like he knew something and I wanted to get out of there as fast as possible.

“Kurt,” He muttered gruffly. When he sat down I realized just how a child sees their parents. He never really seemed to change from when I was a kid, but he had changed in so many ways. The lines around his mouth and forehead were far deeper and the skin around his cheeks and neck was beginning to sag. I tried not to think about it.

“Hey, dad.” 

“Heading back today?” 

I glanced around the room anxiously.

“Uh, yeah.”

He sighed and there was something to his presence that was daunting.

He put a firm hand on my shoulder.

“Son, I want you to know how very proud I am of you, my boy. Truly.”

I just stared at him, dazed.

“And I think…your mother is very worried about you.”

I didn’t respond. He scoffed and shook his head, looking across the room.

“I mean, we worry. After all, you’re all we’ve got. I just want you to know that we care about you, son. If you ever need anything, you just give us a call.”

I started to stand when he gripped my forearm and sat me back down on the bed. My heart thudded and my throat was closing up. Then he leaned in and hugged me; a real fatherly hug. I could feel his compassion from the tightness in his hands around my shoulders. I felt so angry…angry at myself for becoming such a terrible son. A liar, a failure. Something in me knew at that moment, with my father’s arms wrapped tightly around my body that he wasn’t as stupid as I thought he may have been this weekend…he knew I wasn’t going back to school. But I wasn’t about to have that conversation.

	Before he left the room to go to work, when I was finally ready to gather my things and leave for Salmon Challis, he stopped in the doorway.

“You haven’t heard from the Marshes', have you?”

My heart dropped. I just stared with wide eyes until I was able to lie straight into his face again. Why did he say “The Marshes’?” Of course I don’t talk to Caleb’s parents. I sighed.

“No, we don’t really talk anymore.”

“Ah, I see. Well Caleb’s mother says she has you in her thoughts. ” He muttered and closed the door behind him. 

That didn’t make any sense. Why would she have me in her thoughts when she has a whole son of her own to worry about? I tried to let the confusion subside and think about heading out to meet my best friend in the woods.

so i have a friend im really into but i need a stable objective opinion from someone else and i cant tell my friends or family any of this. 

We became friends in January and have been getting closer since then. Hes done a lot of subtle flirtatious things, especially when drunk. But I cant tell if the other things he does are something a super kind friend would do or if there is more. 

* I notice he looks at me a lot when we're in a group, even when im not talking
* He helped me tour apartments, drove me back and forth to the real estate office and all the related errands, translated the lease for me (im a foreigner and dont speak the local language that well), and used his car to move all my stuff.
* He walked me home on my first night at my new apartment even though his house is a lot closer.
* He changed his profile picture for the first time in forever to a photo I took of him and called it the best picture he has.
* He cut my steak during a meal after i had just offered him a bite (he cut the whole steak then took a piece). When a friend pointed out that he's too nice to me, and that's why she thought he likes me, he just laughed and pretended to cut her rice. He also asked who else thinks that he likes me (in our office)
* He pays attention to the things i do or do not like. and he proudly points out that he remembers whenever its brought up, or tells people (like when i put too much spice on my food, he tells them ""oh she really likes spicy food""
* When his friends teased him about a wet spot on his pants and i played along, he got panicked and defensive, and has been getting more embarrased by small things when his frineds point them out in front of me
* When a man stalked me and asked me out in the office, i told him how it made me uncomfortable and explained what happened, so he called the guy a creep and went to look for him to make sure hes not around still
* When his friends were hyping him up about his body, he pretended to lift his shirt up and looked at me and smiled and tilted his head as if asking ""Should I?/Do you want to see?""
* His friends might be on to it?
   * When he was asking us what hairstyle to get, his friend emphasised my opinion, even though it was different from the others, and basically told him he should listen to me
   * When me and him were talking in the lounge area one time, his friend (who was on his phone) smiled slightly and got up to leave, even though he didnt have to
   * his other friend makes sure to make space for him to sit next to me sometimes
   * We were grabbing food and his friend told me to take a fruit plate back to the table specifically for my crush, even though his friend couldve just done so himself 

Signs he may not like me:

* He’s deflected my invitation to go walk by the river twice, first time he was hungover and sick, second time he had to work.
* He showed no visible jealousy when the other guy asked to talk to me alone—only commented after i told him i was uncomfortable and acted like he had no clue that this is what the guy was up to. He asked me about the ""creep"" again today, and told me if hes contacted me, he also asked what the creep does and i said i think hes in the medical department, so my crush said ""oh maybe hes rich you dont like rich guys?"" i said not this guy lol
* He’s never taken much initiative to spend time one-on-one, except for twice, once for dinner (everyone else was busy) and another to grab coffee.",0,1749878256.0,NoStupidQuestions,3,0.25,False

You know the type: the **fashionable**, **sassy**, **clapback king**, who’s always dressed like he’s on the cover of VOGUE even when it’s 8 a.m. and they’re just going to class.

Like I genuinely thought we were getting the **""stylish but secretly loyal best friend""** character. The kind of guy who walks in like he owns the place 💅, roasts everyone without blinking 🫢, and always has a one-liner ready that makes the whole room go silent. The one who seems bitchy at first, but then you realize: *wait… he's actually one of the most loyal and emotionally grounded people in the cast* 🥲.

And let’s be honest, this archetype is **usually gay** in teen shows. Like, Kurt from *Glee*, Eric from *Sex Education*, Nathan from *Euphoria* (but way less emotionally stable 😭), or even the classic Damien from *Mean Girls*. So I thought they were gonna give us a little **twist,** same energy, but make him straight this time. A straight, savage fashion icon who becomes Kitty’s chaotic, judgmental, but ultimately ride-or-die best friend. The kind of bestie who drags your outfit but will also fight your ex if they hurt you.

I imagined their dynamic being peak *enemies to frenemies to besties,* with Kitty constantly being like “ugh why are you like this??” and Minho just sipping his overpriced iced coffee, saying, “Because I have taste, babe.” Like, full sass energy. Zero romance. Just ✨vibes✨ and savage support.

But THEN… surprise, he’s the **love interest**??? I was honestly like...HUH??? Not mad about it, but completely thrown off(not in a bad way). I had already mentally placed him in the ""scene-stealing, emotionally unavailable best friend with hidden softness"" box.

And I know we already have Q in the show, and yes, he’s our sweet, supportive king 👑, but it's *not the same.* Q gives me calm, level-headed **therapist friend** energy. You know, the one who keeps the group grounded, helps everyone with their emotional crises, and somehow always has snacks in his bag. But Minho? I thought Minho was gonna be the one who’s a little **toxic**, a little **extra**, but also **undeniably iconic**.

So yeah, I’m just saying… my first impression of Minho was that he’d be the straight version of the classic gay best friend character. Turns out he’s the leading man, and I did *not* see that coming 😭. I had already mentally filed him under “chaotic bestie with a skincare routine and a superiority complex who’d end up giving Kitty dating advice, and be there whenever she need.”

Anyone else got that vibe at first or was it just me projecting my love for fabulous besties with secret hearts of gold?",4,1749878133.0,XOKittyNetflix,0,1.0,False

Deal breakers for me are:  
Smoking (cigars and pipe tobacco are exceptions)  
Doing weed  
Not wanting children in the future (I'd like to be a dad thanks)  
Having children of your own (but not be a dad that fast)

Only Robbo \[Mark Robinson, New Zealand Rugby CEO\] and the board know the answer to that. All I know is my version of events, which began when Sam Cane and Ardie Savea bailed me up in the tunnel as I was making my way to the press conference.

“Right, everything is all sorted now,” Sam said.

“What do you mean by that?” I replied.

“You’re not going to resign now,” he said firmly.

I was surprised that he thought that had been an option, because I’d never said anything to anyone about resigning. I didn’t ask where they’d got that idea from, but it seemed they felt that would be my solution.

But now they said it wasn’t an option: that they had put everything on the line to win, and they were urging me to think again.

“I have no idea what the future holds or whether I’m going to be the All Blacks coach tomorrow,” I told Sam and Ardie, “but I promise you one thing: I won’t be resigning.”

That was where I left it, but they said: “We’re going to do something about this.”

I didn’t think they had any cards to play and assured them they’d done everything they could already.

“You’ve done everything you can do by winning,” I replied. “It’s in the CEO’s hands now.”

I didn’t direct them or encourage them, but they said they wanted to talk to Robbo. All I said was: “That’s your choice. This is not my game anymore. I’ve done what I have to do, and now it is everyone else’s choices.”

When I got back to the hotel, I found out that the All Blacks leaders had decided to call a meeting with the CEO. They didn’t tell me directly that they were doing that, and the whole time I was All Blacks coach, I never knew what was said at that meeting, because I never asked.

That evening, there was a rooftop barbecue held for the team at the hotel, and when Robbo came back after he had finished that meeting, he sat down near me and tried to chat normally. That was good. I was pleased he was there and enjoying the moment, but the respect I’d had for him previously had changed. It was a hard relationship for me to figure out how to be because I felt there were so many things happening around me and behind me. There was not a lot of trust between us anymore. In fact, I would even say there was zero trust.

I went to bed feeling satisfied with what we’d achieved that day. As I was about to turn out the light, my phone lit up with a message from Robbo asking if I was available for a chat. I knew he was going to do a media conference the next day and what he wanted to do was say he’d spoken to me before he announced whatever he planned to say the next morning. I didn’t want to ruin my night, so I turned my phone off.

The next morning, I started packing and reviewing the game. Matt \[Manukia, All Blacks communications manager\] came up and told me Robbo was going ahead with his media conference, and that I would do mine an hour and a half later. Matt asked what I was going to say, and I said I’d just talk about the game.

“What about your future?” Matt asked, but I said I didn’t know.

Matt told me everyone was talking about what I’d said to Jeff Wilson after the match, which I took to mean that NZR \[New Zealand Rugby\] weren’t happy about it. But I’d just been honest. I told Matt to come and find me after the CEO’s press conference so he could tell me how it went.

A little while later, Matt reported back to me and said, his words, “It was a disaster.”

He said that Robbo had said nothing and had looked scruffy. The media were spewing, wanting to know why the CEO had called a conference if he had nothing to say. Robbo’s basic message had been that he was going home and would talk to his board about my future.

Like I say, only Robbo will know the answer, but I think we forced NZR into changing their plan – or at least we put enough pressure on them that they were no longer willing to commit to definitive action until they had reconvened and talked it over.

After Robbo had finished with the media, he texted me to ask if we could have a coffee. I said yes, but was quite specific that we would meet in the foyer of the hotel, where everyone would be able to see us. I didn’t want to be tucked away in a secluded corner for this conversation.

I asked him how his conference had gone and he said okay, and then straight off the bat he told me that all the leaks to the media had to stop. I had no idea to what leaks he was referring to.

“Why are you talking to me about that?” I asked. He doubled down: “There is too much stuff coming out and we have got to stop it.”

“Do you think I am doing that?” I said in disbelief.

“Well, if it’s not you, it’s people around you, or people you can control.”

It felt like we were going well off-piste, but as he’d brought it up and seemed keen to talk about, I decided to make a few things clear. “Robbo, I haven’t got a media strategy to undermine you or to leak anything,” I said firmly. “It doesn’t serve my interests when the team is leaked and all that sort of stuff. I don’t know why you’re saying it’s me or someone in my set-up. By the way, have you looked over your shoulder at your own board?”

Robbo told me that he thought he had his board under control and that no one was leaking from inside the organisation.

Whatever the point of this exchange had been, I felt it needed to end. “Why don’t we agree that you’ll look over your shoulder at your board and I’ll look over my shoulder at my group?” I said.

I think we were having this odd exchange about media leaks because Robbo had nothing else to say to me. He certainly didn’t have any clarity about my future. All he told me was that he had to go back to New Zealand and talk to the board, and that he’d be in touch early next week.

It was all so wishy-washy. Nothing like we think you have a job or don’t have a job. It was nothing like that ... just, we will have a chat next week. He was stuck in no man’s land – not prepared to fire me but also not prepared to give me any assurances about my job.

Robbo knew he had to be careful in what he said, because he’d been getting in contact with Razor \[Scott Robertson\] back in New Zealand that week – and he must have suspected that I knew about it. He had been bailed up by All Blacks leaders, and we’d just beaten the Springboks. And now the head coach was sitting across from him and saying he didn’t know whether he still had his job or not. I just don’t think, sitting there in the atrium of the Sandton Sun Hotel that day, Robbo had any idea what his next move should be.

I did my media conference shortly after my coffee with Robbo and basically repeated everything I’d said the night before. Inevitably, the questions came about the answer I had given \[Jeff Wilson, Sky presenter and former All Black\] and I said, ‘Look, the reality is that’s not my decision. But am I going home preparing to play Argentina? Yes, I am. Am I 100% sure about things? No, I am not.’

\*\*\*

I arrived home on the afternoon of Monday, 17 August and was straight on the phone to Joe Schmidt. I needed to see if I could persuade him to change his role from analyst and selector to attack coach.

“I’m assuming, for the moment, that I still have the job,” I told him. “I enjoyed doing the attack and it was the right thing for the guys to hear me a lot more in South Africa. I think I could do it for the rest of the Rugby Championship.”

But I suggested to Joe that he should have a talk with his wife, Kelly, and consider joining the team on the end-of-year tour so he could help me with the attack.

Joe told me he’d already spoken to Kelly and he was ready to start work next week. Robbo and Lendo \[NZR general manager, professional rugby and performance Chris Lendrum\] were back at my house the next day with some news. The NZR board had decided to stick with me as coach and was backing me through to the 2023 World Cup.

Our conversation was matter-of-fact, perfunctory, but that was fine with me. I told them that Joe was going to join us as an assistant coach, and they were pleased with that.

I would be very surprised if Robbo hadn’t spoken to Joe about this beforehand at some point, because they’d already been speaking to him about Razor. So I don’t know how surprised they were by my news, but I felt it was clearly the right thing for the team.

The next day, I went up to Auckland and did a media conference with Robbo and the NZR chair, Stewart Mitchell, who both said they were backing me 100% to the Rugby World Cup.

What I found most interesting about this whole period was that Robbo had let the media define his strategy. I never felt that he or the NZR board had a clear strategy of their own.

They were constantly coming up with ad-hoc plans. Within the All Blacks, we had a defined strategy that was guided by a simple principle of always doing the right thing for the team. I don’t think Robbo ever understood that, and it was becoming almost impossible to function effectively because of the lack of alignment and unity.

The latter group had better kidney function.)

But it starts with the foundation…
Post. Share. Start the conversation
On Reddit, in real life, wherever people talk about coffee bring your voice and your passion to the table

Every tag, every photo, every review
It all compounds
It signals to roasters, brands, and partners that this is real, alive, and worth investing in

I’ve got exclusive partnerships waiting to go live
But I won’t pull the trigger until the effort and enthusiasm reflect the ambition Rotation is capable of.

I get hundreds of DMs every month about Rotation
But almost zero posts in r/coffeerotation
That disconnect is loud. If you want Rotation to continue you have to do your part and make the effort.

If you believe in Rotation
Match the energy

Because this is just the beginning

If I’ve built all of this running on fumes
Imagine what happens when the real ones lock in
And we start turning this into something that cannot be ignored

Trust the vision
Let’s build something legendary

29F from BSB here — just putting it out there that I’m looking for a chill buddy to hang out with. Could be coffee runs, deep or random convos, cafe-hopping, or just vibing and getting to know each other.

Tried dating apps and honestly? Kinda grossed out by how fast some guys jump straight into sexy talk 🙃 Like… can we not? I’m all for good vibes, good convo, and maybe a chill night out (or in) — not trying to get spicy from the first “hi.”

If we vibe and things naturally heat up later, that’s cool — but let’s not make that the main mission from the start. I’m just here to make genuine connections and keep my days a little brighter 💫

Open to all genders and ages — as long as you bring respectful energy and good chat, I’m down to meet. Slide into my DMs if this sounds like your vibe! ☕💬✨

I’ve already made the “I’m crazy” jokes, and we literally had a conversation about being “double trouble” in a bar fight if it comes to it lol. But I know my bpd can affect my relationships a lot, I’ve been struggling with a fwb situation too and have been kinda down on myself. Again, whollleeeeee other thread.

She wouldn’t notice. 

I’m sitting with my fiancé and parents attempting to plan our wedding. She’s texting/calling multiple times to get me to leave the group and hang out with her one on one. I “calmed” her by promising to get coffee with her in the morning. I feel like a prey constantly trying to escape my predator. This is so embarrassing that she doesn’t care that she’s doing it in front of him. She waited for me to come upstairs to make me feel guilty about not reposting an instagram story of us. She gets offended that I would repost my cousin’s story and not hers. 

For years she’s manipulated me into being her personal assistant. I’ll give one example; one time she left me to do HER COLLEGE HOMEWORK to go to a hookup. She didn’t care about my time, my own homework, my own life. If she had it her way (AND SHE TRIED) I would’ve been living at home with my parents and everyone would be happy to accept that my role is to be there for her, to give her all of my free time because; “sisters need to stay together and help each other”.

I sprinkled some cinnamon over my coffee to-go, put on my charmed bracelet, rolled my protective oil on the way and did my tarot reading for the day on the bus (in my phone) as I went. It wasn't until I was on the elevator to my class that it hit me just how fluid all those layers of magical practice simply happened. 

For the longest time, whenever I took time to practice it was a whole ordeal; no one could be home, I took out every single ingredient I could find, must do an hour long meditation, yada yada yada. And though, yes, doing solemn rituals has its own lovely charm and power, it didn't feel integrated... It was like an extra thing I had to summon into my day when the conditions were precise. That made me drop my practice all together a couple of times, it just wasn't solid. 

Now? It happens in the most natural way, so much so that I just noticed how present it is in the smallest ways and this feels like it's here to stay. I still can't go all out, I'm in the broom closet after all and will continue to be until I move, but I'm so content with how my magick has interwoven itself to become almost mundane.

Earlier that evening I'd encountered a bug in which I'd used my bene gesserit sprint and spawned 100 meters in the air far off, landing in the middle of the desert, and was eaten by my first worm, so I was very aware crossing this time would be extra dangerous. To my surprise, I made it across successfully, but I was hit immediately by a sandstorm on the other side and died of exposure.

I know this time around I can't risk faffing about and I need to get a copy of my Hagga base copy situated immediately to avoid dying from the elements. I've got my solido replicator packed, some cash, granite and scrap metal, but I'm having so much trouble this afternoon working up the nerve to make the crossing again. I'm totally new to survival games, and I know half the fun is risking the wipe and starting over. I'm sort of enjoying that element, but understanding the systems is slow going for me so I'm feeling quite nervous. Maybe I've had too much coffee this afternoon.

Let’s be real for a sec

This might run long. It might feel like a lot. But if you’re someone who feels things too damn deeply, overthinks life during those 2:27 a.m. silences, or just quietly wants something real... something slow, honest, and not just a vibe curated for social media, then maybe this is for you.

Maybe this isn’t a coincidence. Maybe it’s a weird little sign. Maybe this is that leap of faith we've both been avoiding but kinda need.

I don’t think people show up in our lives by mistake.
Some are distractions. Some are detours.
But a few rare ones feel like destinations we didn’t even know we were searching for.
And when they show up, it’s like your soul just whispers, “this. this is what i’ve been missin.”

So hey, 

I’m 26. I’m a doctor.
And no, I’m not gonna diagnose you unless you sneeze in a really suspicious way and my reflex kicks in.

But I’m not just a guy in a white coat. I’m a certified nerd.
Like, not the aesthetic Tumblr-type nerd. The real kind.
I drop Marvel quotes in casual convos, question what timeline we’re even in, and I’m still lowkey mad at how certain movies messed up basic physics.

I fall in love with characters that don’t even exist.
I get stuck thinking about time, death, consciousness, memory, and whether we’re all just walking collections of nostalgia wrapped in flesh.
Sometimes I sit with chai like I’m the main character in a slow detective story, trying to solve a medical case mixed with a metaphysical crisis.
Other times I disappear into deep dives about marine biology, nanotech, or quantum stuff because my brain said, ""dig deeper bro, we ain't done.""

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a little Arabic (barely survival level).
Oh and I’m learning Klingon. Because why the hell not. Curiosity and chaos kinda are my love languages.

There’s this voice in my head

Not always nice. Not always soft.
But it pushes me.

It says things like:
Think harder.
Fix what’s broken.
Don’t settle.
Show up. Even when no one else does.

That voice keeps me going.
Not for grades. Not for a resume.
But because I need to understand the world. The people. The pain. The purpose.
From nanotech in medicine to how grief rewires the brain… I need to know.
Because surface-level stuff bores me. Always has.

So what am I looking for?

Let’s keep it simple. I want someone real.

Not someone who ghosts for a week and shows up with “hey”
Not someone who starts with “wyd” and ends it with “lol”
Not someone chasing aesthetics but scared of actual connection

I want the long weird convos.
The kind that start with memes and end with life, death, and what our childhood still haunts us with.

Someone who can say “I’m not okay today, can we just exist together for a while” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who sends a lyric because it hit too hard.
Someone who smells something and is instantly back in a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs at dumb memes like a gremlin and then goes dead silent thinking about souls, the stars, and why we hurt the people we love.

You don’t have to be perfect. Just human. Just honest. Just... there.

But more than anything right now, I want a study buddy

No, not the “we’ll do one Pomodoro and disappear forever” type.
I mean a real one.

You don’t have to be in medicine. You could be studying architecture, poetry, law, quantum physics, or just figuring out your life.
Hell, you could just be healing. That counts too.

I want someone to sit with, even virtually.
We don't have to talk all the time. We just have to exist in the same digital space while we both work on becoming better versions of ourselves.

Picture this:
Late night grind.
Lo-fi or rain sounds in the background.
Cups of coffee or chai.
That quiet presence that feels like a hug.
And every now and then, a break where we drop the dumbest memes or the deepest thoughts.

We keep each other accountable.
We remind each other why we started.
We check in on tough days.
We say, “hey, you got this. you're not alone.”
We don’t need to study the same topic. Just show up with the same fire. That’s it.

Maybe we start a weird little ritual. Like sending a quote before we begin. Or ending the night with a mini trivia game or a stupid challenge.
Doesn’t matter. As long as we’re growing together.

Some things I’d love to do with you outside study hours

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re trading pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, alternate realities
Debate which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad British or Russian accents just for laughs
Send 4 a.m. voice notes when life’s too loud to type
Make dumb inside jokes that no one else gets
Build a little digital home made of shared silences and late-night chaos


---

Just a few confessions

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more times than I should admit
Neuroanatomy got interesting for me because of a throwaway Sherlock line
I’ve been broken, badly. But I always show up
I’ve walked alone, but never stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth
I want someone who isn’t afraid to sit in the silence with me, and still feel connected

So if you’re

A lil cracked but still showing up
Empathetic but steel-strong inside
Smart but weirdly soft in ways that count
Funny but carrying some quiet heaviness
Brilliant in your own messy, chaotic way

Then maybe, just maybe, this post makes some sense to you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No cool-guy act.
Just me. Tired. Honest. Still hoping.

So if any part of this made your chest feel warm or your brain go “same”, drop a meme, a quote, a song, a thought, anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with study sessions.
Two nerds in different corners of the world.
Showing up. Holding space. Growing stronger.

Together.

Because we’re all just stories.

So what am I looking for?

Let’s keep it simple. I want someone real.

Not someone who ghosts for a week and shows up with “hey”
Not someone who starts with “wyd” and ends it with “lol”
Not someone chasing aesthetics but scared of actual connection

I want the long weird convos.
The kind that start with memes and end with life, death, and what our childhood still haunts us with.

Someone who can say “I’m not okay today, can we just exist together for a while” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who sends a lyric because it hit too hard.
Someone who smells something and is instantly back in a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs at dumb memes like a gremlin and then goes dead silent thinking about souls, the stars, and why we hurt the people we love.

You don’t have to be perfect. Just human. Just honest. Just... there.


---

But more than anything right now, I want a study buddy

No, not the “we’ll do one Pomodoro and disappear forever” type.
I mean a real one.

You don’t have to be in medicine. You could be studying architecture, poetry, law, quantum physics, or just figuring out your life.
Hell, you could just be healing. That counts too.

I want someone to sit with, even virtually.
We don't have to talk all the time. We just have to exist in the same digital space while we both work on becoming better versions of ourselves.

Picture this:
Late night grind.
Lo-fi or rain sounds in the background.
Cups of coffee or chai.
That quiet presence that feels like a hug.
And every now and then, a break where we drop the dumbest memes or the deepest thoughts.

We keep each other accountable.
We remind each other why we started.
We check in on tough days.
We say, “hey, you got this. you're not alone.”
We don’t need to study the same topic. Just show up with the same fire. That’s it.

Maybe we start a weird little ritual. Like sending a quote before we begin. Or ending the night with a mini trivia game or a stupid challenge.
Doesn’t matter. As long as we’re growing together.

Some things I’d love to do with you outside study hours

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re trading pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, alternate realities
Debate which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad British or Russian accents just for laughs
Send 4 a.m. voice notes when life’s too loud to type
Make dumb inside jokes that no one else gets
Build a little digital home made of shared silences and late-night chaos


---

Just a few confessions

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more times than I should admit
Neuroanatomy got interesting for me because of a throwaway Sherlock line
I’ve been broken, badly. But I always show up
I’ve walked alone, but never stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth
I want someone who isn’t afraid to sit in the silence with me, and still feel connected

So if you’re

A lil cracked but still showing up
Empathetic but steel-strong inside
Smart but weirdly soft in ways that count
Funny but carrying some quiet heaviness
Brilliant in your own messy, chaotic way

Then maybe, just maybe, this post makes some sense to you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No cool-guy act.
Just me. Tired. Honest. Still hoping.

So if any part of this made your chest feel warm or your brain go “same”, drop a meme, a quote, a song, a thought, anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with study sessions.
Two nerds in different corners of the world.
Showing up. Holding space. Growing stronger.

Together.

Because we’re all just stories.

Let’s make it a damn good one.

Let’s be real for a sec

This might run long. It might feel like a lot. But if you’re someone who feels things too damn deeply, overthinks life during those 2:27 a.m. silences, or just quietly wants something real... something slow, honest, and not just a vibe curated for social media, then maybe this is for you.

Maybe this isn’t a coincidence. Maybe it’s a weird little sign. Maybe this is that leap of faith we've both been avoiding but kinda need.

I don’t think people show up in our lives by mistake.
Some are distractions. Some are detours.
But a few rare ones feel like destinations we didn’t even know we were searching for.
And when they show up, it’s like your soul just whispers, “this. this is what i’ve been missin.”

Other times I disappear into deep dives about marine biology, nanotech, or quantum stuff because my brain said, ""dig deeper bro, we ain't done.""

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a little Arabic (barely survival level).
Oh and I’m learning Klingon. Because why the hell not. Curiosity and chaos kinda are my love languages.

1lb037q,https://www.reddit.com/r/aftergifted/comments/1lb037q/just_thinking/,Just Thinking,"🌌 Big Bang, Relativity, and the Quran — A Personal Revelation

It happened right after I graduated from vocational high school.
I didn’t have a job yet, and one quiet afternoon — after finishing my Dhuhr prayer — I sat down with a cup of coffee and a cigarette in hand.

I found myself thinking:
""How did the universe really come into existence?""

That question didn’t just float by — it triggered a cascade of thoughts.
My mind began spinning rapidly, not in a straight line, but like gathering scattered puzzle pieces from different fields: physics, cosmology, religion, philosophy…
until it suddenly all started to connect.

I remembered the Big Bang, and the concept of Relativity.
Then it clicked.

> Imagine a glass filled with water falling to the ground.

When it hits the floor, the glass shatters, and the water spreads everywhere —
just like how the universe exploded outward in all directions at the beginning of time.

But that movement doesn’t go on forever.
The spread slows down and stops — because of friction and gravity.

That’s Relativity at play.



And then, a verse from the Qur’an came rushing back into my memory:

> “Do not the disbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were a single entity, then We split them apart? And We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?”
— [Surah Al-Anbiya: 30]



That verse struck a deep chord.
It wasn’t just metaphor anymore — it lined up beautifully with modern physics:

The Big Bang explains the initial explosion

Relativity governs how everything unfolds and interacts

Water as the origin of life, mentioned in scripture

And the Qur’an spoke of it long before any modern theory existed


In that moment, something within me changed.

> My faith deepened — not in spite of science, but because of it.



All of it… packed into a simple yet profound analogy:
A glass of water falling, shattering, and spreading — only to be stopped by the laws of the universe.

That was the moment I realized:

> “My brain may run at high speed... but it’s still limited. And Allah? He is boundless, wise, and far beyond comprehension.”

1lazz1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lazz1m/i_pooped_my_favorite_pair_of_pants_while_driving/,I pooped my favorite pair of pants while driving today,"Well it happened. While relocating across the USA with my partner, I sh*t myself while driving. We had just stopped for a delicious lunch with green chile sandwich, a New Mexican delicacy. Plus a coffee for energy. Big mistake.

After about an hour of driving on the highway, a sudden urge came rushing over me. I knew I didn’t have much time, as I felt this demonic bubbling in my stomach. I saw there was a gas station, at the next exit, and I floored the gas pedal with all my strength. As I was pulling into the station however, I felt my sphincter open. I just couldn’t stop it. Hot bubbling sh*t flowing out of me like lava. I’ve had a few close calls in my day, but nothing could have prepared me for this flood. My gates could not contain it. It was not a small amount.

Luckily my husband saved my life. He helped me gather a change of clothes, bought me wipes, covered up my car while I changed my pants, and even booked me a shower stall at the gas station. He then cleaned up any residue in my car while I showered. Unfortunately my favorite pair of pants were coated in so much poop I just couldn’t save it. Maybe I could have, but I wasn’t going to drive hundreds of more miles with poop soaked pants in my car, boiling in the hot summer sun.

I just can’t believe this happened. One of the most embarrassing things that’s ever happened to me. I probably won’t be eating green Chiles again for a long time.",12,1749875174.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,0.84,False

1lazyt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoetryWritingClub/comments/1lazyt5/when_god_forgot_to_press_save_after_i_finally/,when god forgot to press 'save' after i finally healed,"hi. my name is arun.  
i am 27 years, 4 months, and 29 days old. emotionally printed in black & white.  
and if you're reading this, it probablly means the healing didn’t stick.

i think i was fine for 3.5 days.  
i smiled at a dog. i whistled in the lift. i even replied to a work email with a “sure thing :)”  
do you know what kind of mental delusion it takes to type a smiley in lowercase?  
i thought i was healed.  
but turns out, i was just running on the free trial of stability.

on day 4, the crash came like my mother’s chappal unexpected, precise and karmically deserved.  
it began with a loose bedsheet corner that kept slipping off at night.  
i fixed it 4 times.  
on the 5th time, i stared at it and thought,  
“this is love effort that never holds.”

i tried to make coffee but the decoction spilled.  
the stain looked like my old therapist. i apologized to it.

the thing is no one tells you that after healing, the world doesn’t pause and give you a certificate.  
you just return to the same ceiling fan. same toothpaste. same traffic jam that smells like capitalist depression and hot idli steam.

i texted a friend:  
“i feel empty again.”  
he sent back a mrme.  
a cat wearing sunglasses saying “vibe check failed.”  
we laughed.  
i muted him for 3 days.

my mother asked why i haven’t been talking much.  
i said “throat infection.”  
truth is silence has become a comfortable language in my echos.  
i speak fluent awkward nods and passive aggressive Spotify playlists now.

i downloaded Bumble again.  
matched with a girl who said she’s “emotionally available but mentally on Airplane Mode.”  
i sent: “same. i’m emotionally delivered, mentally returned to sender.”  
she unmatched.

i made maggi. overcooked it.  
added lemon. added guilt. added crushed red hope.  
tasted like loneliness with a dash of “i should call my dad”

sometimes i sit in my bathroom with the shower off, just letting the echo of water from the neighbour’s tap pretend like it’s raining.  
i call it “method acting for sadness”

once a crow brought me a rubber band.  
not a sign. not a miracle. just a soggy rubber band.  
i wore it around my wrist like a friendship band from the universe.  
it snapped in an hour.

i walk past couples and pretend i’m part of their montage.  
like if i walk slow enough, someone will loop me into their forever.  
but no.  
i am always the “meanwhile” guy  
the background glitch.  
the one you remember 3 years later and go “oh damn wonder how he’s doing”

i went to a therapst again.  
new one.  
he had LED lights in his room.  
the kind you see in Twitch streams.  
i told him, “my heart feels like a pdf that won’t open”  
he nodded. gave me a worksheet.  
i haven’t opened it.  
because even healing now comes in downloadable form with password protection and guilt updates.

my ex posted a reel with the caption “self love is a journey”  
i wanted to comment: “hope the journey has potholes”  
but i didn’t.  
i’m mature now.  
i just screenshot it, sent it to my best friend and wrote: “godspeed to whoever dates her next”  
and i kept laughing for 3.5 days, thinking danm i'm so funny.

i saw two pigeons fighting over a paper straw.  
watched them for 11 minutes.  
felt more real than most of my relationships.

sometimes i look at my ceiling and think  
if i hang a dreamcatcher here will it trap all these recurring 3am thoughts?  
but then i remember dreamcatchers don’t work on guys who dream in error 404s.

but yeah.  
if you ask me how i am today,  
i’ll say “fine”  
because it’s easier than explaining that i’m a half-downloaded person trying to live in a fully-updated world.  
still buffering. still glitching.  
still alive.

if you're still reading this:  
hi. i love you. not in a weird way.  
or maybe yes, in a deeply weird, IKEA-instructions level confusing way.

let’s rot with grace.  
let’s laugh with broken teeth.  
let’s drink coffee like it’s a hug from the void.  
let’s scroll endlessly and pretend we’re looking for meaning.  
maybe one day, healing will come and stay.  
maybe god will remember to press ‘save.’

until then,  
i’ll be here, in the lift, not pressing any buttons,  
listening to elevator jazz and crying in lowercase.

1lazwkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsThisBagWorthIt/comments/1lazwkg/is_horse_clementine_bag_worth_it/,Is Horse Clementine Bag worth it?,"The Horse Clementine is an Australian-designed leather bag that gained popularity through TikTok and influencer marketing. But is it actually worth it? We looked through Reddit posts from late 2023 to early 2024 to find out what real users are saying about the quality, style, and value.

# The Good

* **Surprisingly good leather for the price** ""The leather is absolutely beautiful—so soft, thick, and luxurious."" (14 upvotes)
* **Tough enough for daily wear** ""My bag is abused daily and you can’t tell at all. Great quality for under $200."" (15 upvotes)
* **Softens beautifully over time** ""I’ve had one since it came out… it has a gentle droop now. I’m happy!"" (112 upvotes)
* **Roomy and practical** ""Easily fits 2 cans side by side."" (180 upvotes)
* **Easy to open and use** ""I don’t find getting in or out difficult at all."" (12 upvotes)
* **Magnetic closure is a nice touch** ""I prefer the Clementine because of the magnetic opening. It just works for my lifestyle."" (20 upvotes)

# The not so good

* **Some bags arrived stiff or underwhelming** ""I ordered two and the quality was not it. Sold both immediately."" (44 upvotes)
* **Chemical smell (especially taupe)** ""It has a very strong chemical smell—my whole living room smelled like chemicals."" (16 upvotes)
* **Hardware could be better** ""I wish the hardware was a bit sturdier."" (14 upvotes)
* **Strap might be too short for some** ""I’m short and even at the longest setting, it sits a bit high. Taller folks, beware."" (12 upvotes)
* **Doesn’t look quite like the ads** ""It gives more of a rectangular look crossbody—like a brick."" (58 upvotes)
* **Skepticism over marketing** ""There’ve been like 5 posts this week—anyone else feel like this is a coordinated marketing push?"" (200 upvotes)



# Compared to Alternatives

* **Not quite a** [**Loewe Puzzle** ](https://go.shopmy.us/p-19617302)**dupe** ""Everyone calls it a Puzzle dupe but it’s its own thing, honestly."" (27 upvotes)
* **Still gets compared to the Puzzle a lot** ""I have both this and the Puzzle. Both soften over time for the slouchy look."" (32 upvotes)
* **Some prefer it over the Puzzle** ""I like this WAY more than the Puzzle. Probably because I see that one so much."" (23 upvotes)
* **Songmont Drippy Roof is a strong contender** ""It slouches nicely and still looks brand new after months of daily use."" (12 upvotes)
* **More realistic expectations for $200** ""We can’t expect it to match Loewe—those are handmade with next-level leather."" (16 upvotes)

# Worth it?

* **Feels worth the price to many** ""I bought Clementine in coffee and beige too. Happy with all of them."" (20 upvotes)
* **Affordable and worry-free for daily use** ""It’s affordable enough to use without a care and fits a lot!"" (14 upvotes)
* **Good customer service** ""They refunded me $50 because I missed a sale by 48 hours. That was nice."" (52 upvotes)
* **Not everyone thinks it’s a deal** ""Nothing about The Horse is premium. For $170 USD, you get what you pay for."" (16 upvotes)

Tips & tricks

* Give it time to break in ""Just push the middle down with the strap a bit and it’ll slouch like the photos."" (27 upvotes)
* Be careful with liquids ""Always put cans in a plastic bag—I've ruined two bags from soda leaks."" (41 upvotes)
* Reuse liners from other bags ""I use my small Puzzle bag liner in the Clementine—fits perfectly."" (20 upvotes)

Final Take

Reddit users generally agree the Horse Clementine is a solid mid-range option. It won’t rival high-end designer bags in craftsmanship, but it punches above its weight in value, style, and functionality - especially after breaking in.

That said, don’t expect perfection. Some batches had chemical smells, others showed quick wear, and the marketing feels a bit too polished. But if you go in with reasonable expectations, the Clementine delivers as an affordable, stylish everyday bag.",1,1749874932.0,IsThisBagWorthIt,0,1.0,False
1lazw2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/comments/1lazw2r/520_while_studying_full_time_doing_2_part_time/,"520 while studying full time, doing 2 part time jobs, research, and managing adhd , a very chaotic guide","TLDR: Scored a 520 on the MCAT while juggling jobs, research, full-time classes, and ADHD. Used a flexible, energy-based study routine instead of a rigid schedule. Prioritized high-yield resources (UWorld, AAMC, Aidan Anki deck) and heavily relied on ChatGPT for structure, feedback, and logic refinement. Focused on mastering weaknesses, reviewing mistakes deeply, and optimizing efficiency over perfection. Wouldn’t recommend this approach for everyone, but it worked because of strong time management, self-awareness, and constant pivoting. unconventional tips at the bottom.

hello!

I'll try to keep this as non-repetitive and helpful as possible. I'm still really surprised at my score (520), I tested 5/10. A lot of people previously asked for my routine so I'll try to split up my tips for each section, as well as miscellaneous life style things that really helped me. Feel free to scroll to what you wish.

**CONTEXT:**

I took the MCAT in spring of my 2nd year and iwll be graduating in 2.5 years. I didnt think I would be so taking the mcat wasnt in my plans.

I didn't realize I would be applying so soon and so I booked it in December and had no idea what I was doing. At that point, I had only taken gen chem, genetics, basic bio, psychology, sociology, and kinematics/fluid based physics (1 and 2). I was learning ochem, biochemistry, and molecular bio as I took the Exam, with a quarter system school (10 weeks).

I wanted to take the exam once and be done, and I also didn't want to sacrifice everything else I was doing to take it . My commitments were as below:

**research** ( I published a paper and 3 posters this year so it took more time ) , would estimate 13h/week between both projects

**1st job (4-10h/week)** \- I cut down my hours towards the end

**2nd job (4-9h/week)** the reason this is so vague is because it really depended on the nature of the owrk. some weeks were very light, others were really intense, so 9h would be a conservative estimate for those heavy weeks.

**School** : was taking 16 units per quarter. this was ochem lecture, lab, bio, and another course as applicable for my major. It was a lighter schedule but still tough for me because of organic chemistry and the pressure of the MCAT.

**- side hustle/ passion project:** this definitely took up its own chunk of time but I dont have a set hours for it. it took a backseat and I definitely delegated a lot more.

I maintained a 4.0 though, so I'm proud of myself for that :D

**\*\*towards the end of my studying, I reduced any hours I could. so keep that in mind LOL**

**RESOURCES:**

\-uworld (didnt finish)

\-Aidan deck (highly rec) (didnt mature this all lol)

\- kaplan set, uworld book set (tbh I found them online for the uworld book set , would just flip to certain topics that I couldnt visualize)

\- aamc sbs, cars qpack, all aamc fls, (I did not use the subject qpacks much)

\-CHATGPT PREMIUM THE HOLY GRAIL

**Scores:**

BP HL: 508 (this was taken with no practice problems, only content review)  
AAMC unscored : 514 (this was taken after doing some uworld a few weeks later)

AAMC Fl1 ; 514 (I think I was pushing off chem/physics memorization here)

fl2: 519 (decided to tackle c/p)

fl3; 517 ( was putting off biochem memorization here)

fl4: 519 (tackled biochem)

fl5: 518 (idk I was tired and was chill with this score but reallyyyy wanted a 520, I knew I had certain subtopics and strategies to hone in on)

**real deal: 520!**

**STUDY SCHEDULE:**

I wish I could tell you I had a really rigid and structured schedule. I didn't. my adhd causes me to veryyy quickly get bored so I would lean into the flow of what I was feeling and needed to push through. I very very frequently changed study tactics, used pomodoro, body doubling, classical music, etc. No matter what though, I was absorbing something. Even when I was sick I would just lazily flip thorugh anki, and while you think you aren't absorbing it, it adds up. So do as much anki as u can!!!

I had NO socials at this Time. only reddit if u count that and tbh this sub helped me a lot with different tricks and tips, but I also doom scrolled too much worrying about ""studying the right way"" rather than just studying. easier said than done but just do something.

I would wake up generally around 6-8 am. Instead of scrolling on my phone in the morning, I did anki, usually pscyh or b/b because it's lighter. I highly recommend Aidan for B/b and psych. I didn't really use it too much for c/p, but I'll entail what I did to study instead below.

I ALSO VERY HEAVILY USED CHATGPT TO HELP ME. (it will also help me organize some things better in this post ;p)

I fed it my date, my study topics, my weaknesses, my time blindness and routine, and it would always redirect me. I dont think there is a better scheduler than it, especially if you're someone like me who needs validation but also structure. I didn't like the idea of courses because I believed they forced you to sometimes waste time on mateiral u already are strong in. I very frequently jumped between topics depending on what I was feeling.

With lots of fragmentation due to jobs, research, and emotional burnout, instead of a strict hour-by-hour schedule, I used a modular routine based on energy and focus level -- aka I was studying whenever I got the time! if I was at work and nothing to do? flashcards! at home tired from school? blurting some formulas! no two days were the same but I always focused on 3-5 hours a day of focused studying, and anki in between.

**Here's what a typical day might've looked like:**

1. review a previous uworld set
2. BIO CLASS: watch lecture, do homework ,t things like that
3. 1 hour of ochem CLASS: watch lecture, do textbook problems (I have a bad habit of never attending lecture lol I would just go home and 2x it)
4. uworld - 20 questions ochem, 20 questions gen chem, 10 questions physics/bio or whatever I felt weak on
5. anki -- do some from corrections, finsih a subtopic from each subject (if u know Aidan its ALOT, I didnt always finish everything and at one point I just reset the entire deck 3 months in cuz I got frustrated and thought I was forgetting material)
6. make a cheat sheet mcat for a topic I was weak on
7. amino acid quiz
8. 1 cars passage

This would be a typical day when I was going to class. I commute and only had commitments 3-4 days of the week. If I was fully at home, I would aim to either study more uworld or section bank, or do more things for my classes.

I would go to sleep doing anki-- it would bore me enough to rather just sleep instead. During this period, I had a goal of also gaining muscle, so I would aim for 30-40 minutes of exercise (some days it would just be walking, others it would be hiit/strength. just movement to not feel like I was wasting away in mcat facts)

**Another Sample Routine Closer to MCAT Day: (very close to how I would generate everyday from ChatGPT)**

☐ 10 hard flashcards

**TIPS BY TOPIC:**

CARS: Idk man my bp diagnostic had a 131 cars and I was always around 130-132 cars . I only did AAMC and no third party. I think the logic of AAMC is different and I didn't wanna over complicate things. I think it dropped to 128 during my real test day because I was maybe either tired , stressed, or overconfident.

I ALWAYS HIGHLIGHTED THOUGH! I think cars is truly a matter of active reading and engagement, and seeing what answer is directly supported by the passage. I always did POE here.

I highly attribute my success though to ChatGPT. I made logs on what went wrong for every single question. Here's an example of the log below. I would use voice mode to explain my thought process and untease exactly where I went wrong. my scores very quickly went up.

The log below is from the qpack or tests so just skip it if u are worried about a spoilers for a question (sorry I have no clue where from.. ;') )

    🧠 CARS Error Log – Passage 5, Q29
    ❌ Your Pick: A — Substantial performance gains from small classes occur in early grades and don’t accumulate past 1st or 2nd
    ✅ Correct Answer: D — When class sizes are reduced, the improved performance of teachers who already use methods well suited to smaller classes pulls up the average
    🧩 Question Type: Reasoning Within the Text
    ⸻
    💥 What Tripped You Up:
    •You hovered between A and D — which means your brain spotted the logic chain but didn’t quite lock in where the supporting evidence pointed.
    •You went with A because it sounded true (and it is stated in the passage)… but that’s not what the specific observation in the stem is supporting.
    •You were basically mixing up a result (A) with the reason (D) behind it.
    ⸻
    🧠 Why D Is Correct:
    •The passage says some teachers already use small-class-friendly methods.
    •When class size shrinks, those teachers thrive, and their boosted performance lifts the class average.
    •That’s exactly what D states — it’s the interpretation the observation is there to back up.

    🧠 Why A Is Wrong (Even If It Sounds True):
    •A is a consequence mentioned later: class size reductions help early on but not later.
    •That’s a finding, not what the observation supports.
    •The observation about teacher methods is used to explain why class size reduction works at all, not when it works.

    🔁 Fix-It Strategy:
    TrapFix
    Picked a true-sounding statement that wasn’t what the evidence supportedAlways ask: “What is the point this specific sentence is being used to prove?”
    Confused result vs. explanationAsk: “Is this choice the cause or the effect?” For reasoning questions, they usually want you to spot the cause or support for a claim
    ⸻📌 Takeaway:
    When they ask “What does this support?”, you’re being tested on passage structure — not fact recall. D is the why, A is the what happened. Always aim for the underlying logic the passage is building.
    So I didnt overthink too much on cars.

I would do all of uworld except for CARS. I finsihed almost all non-cars stuff.

**BIO: Fo**r anatomy and physiology, I really just used the Aidan deck. I spent the most time on it and I highly recommend maturing the Bio portion, it's amazing.

Towards the end, instead of rereading the book, I would take a particular sub topic, make it a cram and go in order of the cards created, and make a big picture 1 pager of the topic. This avoids the downfall of anki only showing u details without you losing the big picture (aka visualizing the kidney or the heart), but I liked Aidan because he had integrated details from many different places, so I almost kinda used it like a content review (ONLY TOWARDS THE END)

I blurted very heavily with chatgpt for all topics. I would tell it to quiz me on anything I got wrong and we would have conversations. I made myself say it out loud ""okay.. start from glycolysis and go to tca.."" and would do this for any topic I was weak on, including gen chem/ physics formulas.

**BIOCHEM:** this was just very memorization heavy. Ironically my course didnt help at all and in fact I think studying for the mcat helped in my course than vice versa. dont cram metabolism though.

**CHEM/PHYS:**

gen chem: I honestly skimmed this book in a day and did the practice from kaplan and moved on. I loved gen chem and only had to worry about memorizing formulas and practice. this is what I mean by leaning into strengths and not wasting time.

Same above for ochem , my lecture was more than detailed enough and I didn't see the need. Again, I spent more time focusing on the passages .

Physics: I loved kinematics so took the same approach as above. For fluids and electricity (I hated optics and I had no idea what ohm's law was), I spent the most time here making sure I get it.

**I had a running list of topics I knew I was weak on and instead of avoiding those I would hammer them in the most. I think this was really key to my success and pushing my score up in the limited Time I had.**

P/S: I only did Aidan deck with no content review, and the sb's. I would use chatpgt and reddit occasionally to get the big picture view of theories and terms, but thats it. no 86 300 pg doc. Aidan was more than enough to cover terms and then it was a matter of logic of understanding the terms conceptually (glass ceiling vs glass elevator).

**TIPS IN GENERAL: (HOW I IMPROVED PASSAGE LOGIC) - written better by chatgpt**

1. I Forced Myself to Say Why Every Wrong Answer Was Wrong

I would verbalize why each answer was wrong, and why. Always. I would also ask myself when the answer could be right, or why did AAMC put that answer? Chat helps a lot with this.

2. Experimental Questions

I think I was good at this because of my reserach background but also the Aidan deck has a good experimental deck for control, independent, types of studies, etc. Take a peek at it! UWorld also helped a lot here so just doing a lot of practice.

Flowchart method was also very helpful here.

ALSO: for uworld I did everything from untimed 59q sets to tutored 10q sets. Man honestly I really dont think it matters. I had no time problems and uworld was too hard for practicing it too long. I honeslty was just focused on simplifying it: am I getting questions done in a quality manner? if that meant using tutored to get instant dopamine, so be it.

3. Corrections

For this, I tried everything. new content cards (hated it cuz Aidan had too much), making an excel / log (wouldn't read it agian).

SO I gave up on ALL of that and made my own uworld deck where I would just post the question and then the answer on the back. it forced me to think again about the logic (yes it helps even if u have seen it multiple times). I would put the answer on the back to be why the other answers were wrong and also my chatgpt explanation on my initial error.

4. Practice Tests:  
I only did the AAMC fls in full test conditions and tore them apart. I did FL4 and FL5 within the same week .

**5. Mind Map**: In the last few weeks, I **taped cheat sheets all over my walls** and literally turned my space into a study map. I had:

* **Amino acid structures** on my bathroom mirror
* **NMR shifts** on my closet
* **IR peaks** above my desk
* **Pathways** on doors
* **Acid/base logic + light/optics** near my kitchen sink, etc.

During the test, I genuinely started remembering facts based on remembering my house. For example, I remembered that indole and all those ring structures were a paper on my shoe closet, etc. I think this is a mind palace technique that helped a lot. I got passive exposure to my weakest links aside from Anki.

**6. FINAL WEEKS NOTEBOOK**

I took a blank notebook to make my go to. Here I would do the technique of making cheat sheets based off of Aidan deck and redrawing anatomy a bunch of times (for example, the ovarian cycle), etc.

All FL corrections went here and I kept rereading it.

Any formulas I needed to memorize I kept putting here as well , I memorized almost all of the formulas and constants from Aidan deck. (u can search equation I think in Anki and find them all)

**7. final days before the exam:**  
**I wanted to relax but I am SO Glad I pushed though. all the last minute topics I hadn't reviewed?** really helped My thought process is like ill never do this again I might as well push through now.

Before my exam I redid the c/p sections of the section banks. I would solve it in my head or very passively setting up the answer and just reading the explanation if my logic was right to get through all the questions. If you have time, in the final week, redo both section banks.

**8. AAMC Outline!!!!!**  
I will highly emphasize this because I think it's underrated. I went through the outline 2 weeks out and any topics I was weak on I h hammered it in. too often the practice fls prime us to think we will get similar topics (even subconsciously) and then people freak out when they get ""low yield"". theres nothing truly low yield. just get a general good understanding of everything on the outline.

**9. test day tips!**

\- dress up! for any final or exam I have, I fully dress up . not like crazy, but I definitely doll up more because I believe it makes you feel like ur ready for war. so if u can, dont go in a hoodie and sweats. I think it's psychological tbh.

\- I love caffeine a LOT but I was worried and too nervous to drink it during the exam. I hardly ate except for some trail mix so the only thing to keep me going was coffee candy. highly recommend figuring out what u need and/or getting the candy cuz its less caffeine and I was SO nervous in test day I couldn't have my normal dose.

\- notebook = mental safety blanket , It was the only thing I looked at the morning before the exam as it was all my red-flag topics and it grounded me.

\- **MINDSET: tbh? I** had devoted every minute and second to this exam (not good for ur mental health lol I didnt hang out with friends much) by the time I got the exam I had worried and freaked myself out so much I just stopped and was so calm. I really told myself ""f this im so done lets just get it over with"" and thats the attitude I kept. wiring myeslf too tight was not doing any good. also on the exam, anything I was freaking out over or wasn't remotely sure? flag and skip. **if I couldnt think of it in 20 seconds , skip. in each section I had 30-40 flagged AND THAT WAS OKAY. I would finish each section with minimum 30 minutes and tehn go back adn refine . I had a lot more time that way.**

CLOSING THOUGHTS:  
Would I recommend studying like this? Honestly, only if you’ve ***built up stamina*** and know how to recover from intense burnout. This process was **s**o grueling, especially with quarter system pressure, jobs, and research. I had really hard quarters.

But I also grew in ways I didn’t expect. I stopped chasing “perfect study methods” and instead built **systems that worked for my messy and tired brain.**  I was never a crammer before this but I do better in school exams now because it's made me more efficient. I think it's because I didn’t just study content, I studied myself and what ebbs and flows work for me.

If ur fl averages are not where u want them though? push back. this wont work for everyone and I do attribute a lot of it to my classes overlapping . if ur a different major either I wouldnt do it on this timeline or would severely cut back. its just not possible.  
If you’re in the thick of it:

\- You don’t need to be perfect.

\- You just need to **keep showing up**, pivot when something’s not working, and trust that every broken-down blurt or half-asleep flashcard is still stacking the win.

My mindset was not the healthiest and I definitely obsessed over this test. but tbh, I wouldnt change what I did because the mental peace of never taking this test again nor sacrificing my extra time made it all worth it.

1lazvoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutdoorOasis/comments/1lazvoi/fundamental_question_what_are_the_first_steps_in/,Fundamental Question: What Are the First Steps in Planning an OutdoorOasis?,"So, you're thinking about creating an outdoor oasis! Awesome! But where do you even BEGIN? I think the very first step, before you even look at furniture or plants, is honestly brutal honesty about how you realistically plan to *use* the space. Is it for quiet morning coffees? Rowdy weekend barbecues? A dedicated kids' play area? Identifying the primary function (or functions) dictates everything else.

Second, and related, is taking a good hard look at your space *as is*. Sun exposure is HUGE. What direction does your yard face? Areas that are baking in direct sun all afternoon will need very different plant choices and shade solutions than a shady, north-facing spot.Also consider existing features – any awkward structures,trees you want to keep (or remove!),slopes,etc. Work *with* the space, not against it.

and this one's frequently enough overlooked, spend some time observing the space during different times of the day and different seasons. what looks great in a summer afternoon might be a mosquito-infested nightmare in the early evening, or fully unusable in winter. This helps you plan for lighting, pest control, and seasonal adjustments to your oasis. Anyone have any other ""must-do before you buy anything"" tips?",1,1749874846.0,OutdoorOasis,0,1.0,False

I’m currently in the MSCM Co-op stream at Asper and actively exploring how to secure a Co-op position in supply chain/logistics.



So far, I’ve been building up local experience through volunteering — including at a thrift store, Canadian Blood Services, and the Manitoba Museum. I also previously interned with Tim Hortons' overseas HQ and other international firms in supply chain roles, so I’m hoping to bring that experience into the Canadian job market.



I’d love to hear from fellow Asper students:

\- How did you secure your Co-op (UM portal / cold email / referrals)?

\- If you didn’t get one, what did you end up doing?

\- Any Winnipeg companies you’d recommend I keep an eye on?



As an international student, I’m also trying to build more local connections — if you're open to a short coffee chat, I’d love to hear your journey and share experiences.



Thanks in advance — any advice or insights would mean a lot!

I finally got diagnosed a few months ago and saw my doctor a month ago and my approval has been sent off to start medication. 

I'm just wondering, anyone else here very anxious? I have panic disorder and have experienced prolonged derealization - I usually don't like anything stimulating like I enjoy coffee but can only do two or so before I completely panic and start to dissociate so I am a little afraid of medication. 

I am aware medication isn't the same as caffeine but I'm really sensitive to meds, SSRIs have ruined me but that's another story. 
(Also if anyone has had their libido ruined by SSRIs and ADHD meds have helped do let me know because that would be a very welcome bonus) 

Also has anyone else got the blood test to see which ones would work best for them? My GP said he usually doesn't bother and vyvanse is probably best (psychiatrist said vynavse too) due to it being more gentle and less likely to completely rock my world but I'm still curious. 

Alsoooo I've heard people talk about a ""crash"" and that scares me a bit too, I'm pretty prone to getting really sad and irritable. 

Any advice appreciated. ",1,1749874780.0,ADHD,8,1.0,False
