1it242b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1it242b/desperate_sensations_when_using_glycine_whats/,Desperate sensations when using glycine. What's happening to me? Pelase help me,"I have been taking 3g of glycine before bed, a B vitamin complex (I have the MTHFR mutation), microdoses of 150mg psilocybin, 5 drops of CBD, as well as omega 3 and 50mg of losartan.

I was noticing an increase in my anxiety, but I was associating it with the fear of using psilocybin, but nothing that I hadn't experienced before.

After 2 doses of 150mg of psilocybin (1 week of use), I decided to increase to 200mg and had strong anxiety reactions, which improved after 1 hour. This happened on Sunday. On that same Sunday, I decided to start using 120mg of ginkgo biloba. I had a Sunday without major problems.

On Monday I needed to do some fasting tests, after the tests, I ate a small piece of cake and had a cup of coffee. I don't usually drink coffee, so I already felt more awake. When I got home, I had my first meal of the day and used my supplements.

A while after using the supplements, I started to feel a very strange reaction, which I had never felt before. It is extremely difficult to describe. I felt as if I was having a hard time focusing on something, as if my attention was directed inward (empty, dark) and as if my focus was inside my head and not outside. As if I wasn't fully in my own body. Everything I'm reporting may be inaccurate, as I had never experienced this sensation before. I researched for this sensation and what most closely resembles this description is brain fog and dissociation.

I associated it with the psilocybin I had used the previous day and tried to follow my routine normally, imagining that the sensation would decrease and it really did decrease during the day. On Monday night, I used 3g of glycine, 5 drops of CBD, and went to sleep. During the night, I woke up and noticed that the sensation was more intense. I panicked. I researched and saw that glycine can cause the effect of brain fog in some people. I decided to stop using it.

I only used CBD before bed and during the night from Tuesday to Wednesday (today), I woke up again and noticed I still had a remnant of that sensation. However, I imagined it could just be my anxiety, from experiencing something so frightening.

I decided to stop everything until I felt 100% normal again.

I have some suspicions that I would like help to confirm.

Can this be caused by glycine or by the mix of stimulants such as caffeine and ginkgo biloba? Has anyone experienced anything similar before? Help me not to think I'm going crazy or that I developed some kind of disorder.",1,1739959670.0,Biohackers,1,1.0,False

What do i do!,"So I first met him at a private house party, everything clicked. He was out to a few people as bisexual, which felt safer somehow - like he had a built-in cover story with his girlfriend. We kept things discrete. Late-night meetups, coded messages, all the usual games you play when your love is illegal.

That morning I surprised him was supposed to be special. I'd gotten a promotion at work, wanted to celebrate. Had his favorite breakfast in a paper bag - those overpriced croissants he loves. I had a key to his place. But when I walked in, there she was in his kitchen, wearing his t-shirt, making coffee like she owned the place. And him, coming out of the bedroom in those grey shorts, hanging low on his hips. No shame, no hurry to explain.

'Oh, babe, I was going to call you,' he said, like this was some minor schedule conflict. She just stood there, confused, until it clicked. Her coffee mug hit the floor. The sound of breaking ceramic mixed with her shocked 'What the fuck?'

I left the croissants on the counter and walked out. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely drive. The betrayal wasn't even about him having a girlfriend - I knew about her, technically. It was the casualness of it all. Like I was the afterthought. The side piece.

That's when I downloaded Tinder. Found this girl, Sara, who'd been flirting with me at work. She knew I was gay, thought it was 'exciting.' A few drinks later, we were at her place. The sex was... different. Not bad, just mechanical. Clinical. Like following an instruction manual. But I made sure to get it all on video. Every moan, every fake smile, every moment of straight-passing performance.

I watched that video ten times before sending it. Each time feeling more numb. The message was simple: 'Guess we're both good at pretending.'

His response came within minutes: 'Why would you do this to me?'

Then the drinking started. The calls. The threats to hurt himself. By midnight, his sister was calling me, screaming that he was in the hospital. That's when I realized I'd started something I couldn't control. In trying to hurt him back, I'd given him ammunition. Evidence. Power.

Now every time he shows up uninvited, every time he threatens to tell everyone, I remember - I gave him that power. In a moment of hurt, I handed him the very thing he could use to destroy me in this country where being gay is seen as a crime, a sin, a disease to be cured.

And I still don't know what to do...""",1,1739959423.0,Zimbabwe,1,1.0,False

1it21kt,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1it21kt/coffee_delivered_7_months_off_roast_what_do_we/,Coffee delivered 7 months off roast - what do we think?,"TL;DR - Ordered coffee, received 7 months off roast. Company says below 12 to 36 months is fine. 

I ordered coffee at MaxiCoffee (France). With their own roast, Lugat, the beans were 1-2 weeks off roast. Excellent!

However I also ordered coffee from third parties, Terres de Cafe and Amadito, which were respectively 2 and 7 months off roast. 

I contacted MaxiCoffee with the question whether this was common practise or a slip of QC, and this is their reply:

""To meet your requests, only the Caf√© Lugat brand is roasted in our premises, we therefore ensure fresh roasting for less than 1 month only for this brand.
The other coffees are delivered to us by the different brands, most often without specifying the roasting date, nor any particular guarantees, which absolutely does not alter their excellent quality.

An unopened pack of coffee can be stored perfectly for between 12 and 36 months depending on the brands and types of roasting, without losing its aromatic character.
Coffee is a non-perishable product, so after 36 months, it begins to gradually lose its aromas, but will always remain consumable.""

I got a tm2 approx 3 weeks ago now so it's pretty much brand new. 

Im using it through a globe bubbler, i have both a glass 18mm wpa and a knock off 18mm t bowl from aliexpress. Im using a straw pack method with no additional tamping, so nice and loose.

I have it set to standard calibration (green) and have run through the calibration procedure to double check settings. I've run it at every setting from 1 to 8 in session mode. I had combustion at just over 8 a couple of times, so haven't gone any higher than that.

 I feel my draw is about right, through my globe with a whip it's about 3 - 5 seconds before I get any vapour, then it white walls the bubbler.

I get massive clouds out of it, with 2 BIG lung fulls per load ( rimmed basket screen ) and then I dump out my avb and it's a nice dark brown instant coffee colour.

Ive got 3 batteries in rotation, and I swap it out for a fresh one when the battery light goes purple

The trouble is, it's not getting me high!! 

I know it's not the weed because using the same weed in my arizer air max or my arizer eq I get nicely baked, the air max bowl is about half the size of the tm2!!

Up to now i feel like ive tried everything Can anyone give me any pointers to try and get my method sorted before it gets sold off!!!

# üèÜ Non-Scale Victories

* **Food noise is gone**, and my mood is way up. The stress of constantly thinking about food‚Äî""Is this impacting me?""‚Äîis just not there anymore.
* **Coffee intake dropped** from 3 cups a day to just 1.\[with no effort\]
* **Coke Zero? Completely lost interest.** I was on 10-12 cans per week, and now... nothing.\[with no effort\]
* **Chocolate? Meh.** Used to be 1-3 bars a day, now I just don‚Äôt care for it.\[ with no effort!\]
* **Snacking? Nearly eliminated.** But‚Ä¶ I struggle to hit my protein. I used to easily eat 180-240g daily, and now I just don‚Äôt want meat. Protein shakes are my saviour.
* **Protein actually fills me up now.** Before, I could eat 2 chicken breasts and *still* have 300-400g of Greek yogurt for dessert. Now? No chance.
* **Go-to breakfast** if I‚Äôm not hungry: whey protein + banana.

# ü§Ø The Weird Stuff

* I have what I call **""Mounjaro noise""** instead of food noise‚Äîthis weird mix of wonder, awe, and excitement about my newfound freedom from food.
* **Sleep struggles** ‚Äì If my kids wake me up at night, I find it *way* harder to fall back asleep.
* **Sulphur breath** ‚Äì My wife noticed (she never did before). ""Smell like rotten eggs"". Would welcome anyones tips on how to manage this?!
* **Dry mouth** ‚Äì Brutal from days 1-5, now just random during the day and every morning.
* **Digestion feels sluggish** ‚Äì Not fully constipated, but not as regular as I‚Äôd like.

He has dementia and she is too frail to even cook after two strokes and she has COPD. I have been making their meals for over a year. It all started when I called my dad just to check in and asked what he was doing and he replied ""looking at some sketchy ham."" I asked ""why are you looking at sketchy ham?"" and he said ""well I am trying to figure out if I can eat it or not."" That was the first time I realized my stepmom had stopped making meals and things were getting pretty bad in their house. Things can get bad without us knowing, people hide their difficulties, whether out of shame or pride. I started making their meals after that. My dad was losing weight. He went from 150 to 130 in a year. He was never a big guy, only 5'6 and maybe 180 at his highest, but 130 makes him look ill. He was ashamed to go to holiday gatherings thinking relatives would think he was sick and judge him. I made him go anyway. He was 76 at the time, he is the youngest of his siblings... these gathers, few and far between, each one may be the last they are all together. His oldest brother is 10 years his senior. We are looking at limited years here. Their dad lived to 92 so all us youngsters think we are gonna live forever, My dad is 77. Every time I see a celebrity death headline and its reads about someone in their 70s it remind me my dad is technically old. Money doesn't save anyone. If the millionaires are dying in their 70s, money isn't saving them, life just decides when its time. Noone is every ""old enough"". My grandfather was 92 with dementia and when he died we still didn't think he was ""old enough"". Noone is. We want them forever. No matter how old, we still think its too soon.   
When I was 20, I thought 40 was old. My mom was 42, I remember her saying she wanted to get her high school diploma for her 50th birthday. Now I am 44 and I think about all the things I want to have before I turn 50. The world is wild. Life is wild. We never feel old. We are just our age, but never old. My parents don't feel old in their minds, but their bodies are. I have learned through my friends who are in their 60s and 70s and 80s that we never are old in our minds. We feel the same as if we were in our 20s. We get wiser, we learn, we grow, we get better, but we always feel 25 even if our bodies are 75. I am just realizing now why my thoughts at night, when I lay awake thinking, always go back to 2005. I was 25. I have wondered for the longest time why my brain always go back to that time, like it was yesterday. Maybe we are all 25 in our heads.   
My oldest daughter told me recently she was having a hard time turning 26, that in her mind she never imagined she would live past 25. At the time I didn't really understand completely. I understood that at that age its so hard to see in the future. Your aren't a child, you aren't a young adult, you are at the cusp of being a full blow adult with all these responsibilities. At 25 you are making decisions that can determine the rest of your live.  At 25 my whole life changed too. I met my husband, never went back to VA like I intended to, created a whole new life that I still have to this day (no matter how uncertain at this point, its been a good run for 19 years). There is the Forever 27 club of those that are no longer here, but I think most of us are part of the Forever 25 club and we are still here living and  building on the foundation of who we were at 25. We will never be old, no matter what our bodies say.   
My husband is having a midlife crisis, he is 39. We have been together since he was 20. He hasn't said it, but I know he is going over in his mind how he has spent his 20s and 30s and now looking into to his 40s he is wondering if he made the right choices. He did. He may not see it and the women he talks to will tell him he deserves better than me. But here is the deal, the life he has at this moment wouldn't have existed if he hadn't have had this life with me. I helped him start his business. I created the website, promoted it, set up all the licenses, accounts, made it all official. I put everything in my name to make it a real business. I drove him to every job, I was by his side, even doing the work (mowing lawns, painting cabinets, removing popcorn, painting, everything) for two years. I helped him build this company he has. It started as a lawn care business doing yards for $30 and turned into a half a million dollar a year remodeling company. We did this together. But now, he says I never supported him. This is the lie he tells the women that coddle him. The ones that affirm he deserves better. I am not surprised he has forgotten, most do, and there is always an eager woman to want to take the place of the one that helped create them. Those women didn't do the work, they just want the rewards. I spent all those years investing in this man. My dad invested in this man. Why do you think he is where he is now? He was invested in because we all loved him and wanted him to succeed. He is good, he is smart, he is hardworking, but he didn't make this life alone. The odds of him being where he is now without meeting me, maybe he could have, but I don't see it. I am not trying to claim I am some savior, but I met him poor, sleeping on the floor on a blanket pallet in his brother's 300 sqft apartment. I was poor too. I had a coffee table and a mattress in  my apartment. We built this life together. I believe we are equals, but he seems to believe I am less and he is more. I believe his is ""more"" because I helped him be more. Honestly, I believe without meeting me, the way he was in his 20s, running the streets, clubbing, drinking, drugging, his hot temper, he would have been deported before he made it to 30. Why do you think I drove him EVERYWHERE for 10 years? I would even pick him up from the clubs at 3am two or three times a week. He forgets. He forgets all the times I saved him from the consequences of his actions.   
Actually now that I write that, it makes me realize I may have created this whole situation I am in now. I have spent our whole relationship saving him from consequences. He has never really had any. He has been able to do whatever he wanted for 19 years. I was there to pick his drunk ass up wherever and whenever he called. I saved him from fights. I saved him from the police. I saved him from angry tirades. My nature is giving grace. I try to understand the other side. I try to process facts and stay in the positive because being pissed off all the time isn't something I want to do. I realize now that I may have created this whole situation myself. For 19 years I have let this man off. He has never suffered a single consequence to his actions. Even through all the betrayal, I am still here. No consequences.   
WOW... this is crazy to realize. Looking back over all these years... never has he ever suffered from his actions. The only time was when I made him leave in 2020 after he acted insane and we separated for 7 months but even then I found him a nice apartment in The Domain and he lived like a well off bachelor being coddled by other women, creating some story that fit his best scenario. OMG WTF... I have enabled all of this. I have saved him from so many things... pulling him by his collar out of bars, dragging him out of fights before the police came, lying to police fluffing up the story... even the night his friend got deported, I intervened moments before saving him from the same fate.   
My mind is boggled at this moment. No wonder he has no sense of right and wrong. I have been the only source saying to him something is wrong. And now that he doesn't see me the same as he did, he doesn't have a basis wrong anymore. I was his pillar of wrong. Me giving him so much grace, so much leeway all these years, my stance on wrong no longer has any leverage. That is why these last two years have been so off, so insane to me, because he doesn't respect my position anymore. I was the only consequence he had. When he stopped caring about my opinion, there was no wrong anymore. This explains a lot about the last two years. No wonder I became the enemy. I couldn't understand why all of a sudden I became a villain in his life story. Now I see. Holy hell! I have been going back and forth with man for two years about these different women, not understanding why if he wanted to be with them he wouldn't just leave me. Its because he doesn't see any consequence. I have been his safe place and he believes I will continue to be that for him no matter what. That isn't true. We built a life together. I benefitted and he benefitted. He benefitted some things that are pretty monumental, like a green card. Not saying he didn't deserve it, he does. Our daughter deserve that security and he loves her so much. I would never want her to be without him. But on the scales, what he gained from our relationship was pretty freaking big. Life changing. Life altering. It means a lot of extra advantages over not having it. He can yell all he wants about ""take it back"" but I would never and he knows, even if his pride won't let him, that its a really big thing that millions of people are dreaming of having. Whether he wants to admit it or not, he lucked up. He can claim I am a useless, do nothing piece of garbage, but I am not. I am smart and resourceful. I helped him create and build his business, still do. I had my own separate business for 11 years. My dad sponsored his visa. His life is better because we met. And throughout all these years, he still did whatever tf he wanted. He was never held back. It's only been recently, as he's gotten closer to 40 and he has comingled with some new ladies being earworms  and feeding his ego making him believe I am some kind of villain holding him back from whatever super life he could have with them. Honestly if that's really the case, I wish him the best, go be your best, I don't want to hold him back. I mean its shit, because I helped him get here to be qualified to be whomever they think he can be, but that's just life I guess. If he wants them, if he believes he's better off, maybe he is, because I am tired. I am and have been at my limit. I did it. I served him all these years. I supported and invested and did all the things... when you invest in something there is the idea that you reap a reward. I am not wrong to think that I invested all this work and effort into this life to believe that at some point we get to just be, to just live. Its not my fault he is never satisfied. We have a home, vehicles, every need is met, we can afford our basic wants, life is good... but he wants MORE. Nothing is ever good enough for him, the line moves every time. No goal can be reached because the goal always gets bigger. I don't want an empire and a huge house and 5 brand new cars and and and... I am happy where I am. Life is good. I am content. But his ego, its needs so much more...  I can't make him happy because he will never be happy. Noone will ever make him happy, because he doesn't have a limit. He isn't happy with himself. He has told me so. He can't be content. He won't ever have peace. If I could give him one gift, it would be contentment. I wish so much that I could, or anyone could give him that. If a woman knocked on my door right now and said ""I am taking your husband. I can give him peace and contentment. You will never see him again, but he will be happy for the rest of his life."" I would let him go this instant. I wouldn't be sad about it. At least he would stop hurting people and finally be happy. I want that for him.  I have told him before ""I love you enough to let you go"". I really mean that.   
I think that is why he stays. He knows I have his best interest at heart. I have and always will protect him. He is safe with me. That is why he says even if I don't want this relationship anymore, he won't leave. I am his safe place. I always have been. I have always protected him. Getting his visa was so important to me because it meant he was safe., our daughter's father was safe.  I spent 16 years terrified, protecting him, watching over him, saving him from every bad decision he made.  2022 he got his visa and his attitude changed, he felt powerful on his own and he forgot about me. He doesn't appreciate what I have done. Maybe he does somewhere in  the depths of him, but not on the outside. He doesn't recognize all I have done for him, to keep him safe. He has listened to those planting ideas in his head, whispering in his ears. I know he will never fully see, but I know. I know he is lying in our bed right now, safe, because of me. Those women, these women, any women, they don't know and will never know all I have been through to get this man where he is right now. They just reap the rewards of the work I did. He doesn't see. He forgot. He used to appreciate me, but once his business got bigger and he got the idea he didn't need me, it all changed. These new women, I call them vessels, they are just resources for him, they provide for him something he needs. When they run dry, he will find a new one. He keeps me because I am his constant. He is safe with me. I am stable. I give grace. I understand him in a way he doesn't understand himself. I am not proud that I have this position. This doesn't make me better or on a pedestal. I am not saying that like it makes me better. I actually don't even want this position, it sucks! This is a hurtful, trying, wearing, degrading, exhausting role to play and I don't wish it on anyone. I can't pass it on, because its a nightmare I wouldn't bestow upon my worst enemy, let alone an innocent new comer to his life.  
 I got laughed at when I told one of his 'ladies"" that being with him was my own cross to bear and  they should move on with their lives and not let the circumstances of being with him effect their emotional state or self esteem.  I have cared more about the women he has destroyed over the years that he has. That is why I never took revenge. I wanted to. I wanted to raise hell and call their husbands, I wanted to ruin their lives, especially the ones that knew I existed.  I could have ruined them, but what would I gain? I wanted to show their husbands the texts, the pictures, the call records. I wanted so badly to be a savage bitch, but that isn't me. I worried about the domestic abuse that might come from such information. I worried about their well being. I worried about them more than he ever did. I cared about the wellbeing of the women that didn't give two fucks about mine. They didn't care about me at all, but I cared about them because I knew the damage my husband could and did cause.   
This whole story started because I took food to my dad. He was not mentally ""well"". I left distraught. But what triggered this story was the fact that when I drove down the property and got to the gate, it was closed. When I go, I open the gate, drive up to the house, drive down and out the gate, close it, and leave. But tonight when I got to the gate to leave, it was already closed. I opened it, it should have been open and drove in and up to the house, but it was closed when I went to leave. I got out the van in the darkness, no moon, no lights besides the headlights, and opened the gate, drove up out of the passway and stopped. My anxiety and irrational thoughts said ""Someone closed the gate so I would have to get out and now I am going to get hatched to death when I get out to close the gate."" Country is scary. Its dark, so dark.  You are alone and noone is there to witness a murder. Its irrational thinking. I called my husband so he could be on the phone when I got out the van to close the gate, just for reassurance incase some psycho that closed the gate came out the trees to kill me, but he didn't answer. I called our daughter and she answered on the first ring. I explained my hysteria which she completely understood because she has opened and closed that gate in the dark on a few trips out to my dads. While we were on the phone, I saw the gate close behind me in the rearview mirror and I told her ""nope, whatever fucking phantom just closef that gate can just fuck off."" and drove away. I am sure it was the wind.  I was moments from a panic attack about that gate in the darkness. When I got home my husband was on his phone watching videos. I told him ""you didn't even call me back. I was calling you because I was in a panic and scared."" ..... ""you didn't even call me back"". He said he was asleep when I called. I said ""but you're awake now and you didn't even call me back!"". And that kinda just says it all about where he is in his feelings about me. He didn't even call me back. He knew I was out in the country where I rarely if ever have cell service. I was gone for over 2 hours. I called him and he didn't even call me back. Anything could have been wrong. I could have hit an animal, had a flat, been stranded, got attacked by a gate goblin... and he didn't even call me back. So this... this is why a few weeks ago I stopped caring about who and what and where  he was, because it  shouldn't really concern me, because I don't concern him.

1. Mrs Flood is something akin to The God of Stories. She can manipulate probabilities from afar and has been manipulating events around the Doctor.
2. Mrs Flood is responsible for it snowing whenever Ruby thought of her mother. This was to make the mystery of her irresistible to Sutekh who she needed out of the way - she knew he'd keep the Doctor alive to solve mystery which would allow him to save the day.
3. Mrs Flood is also responsible for Ruby's mum's dramatic pointing - it made it more mysterious, WoOOooOooo!!
4. The Doctor bi-generated because of Mrs Flood. She knew the best way for the Toymaker to be defeated (in a game involving a lot of chance) was to make sure there were two of him.  Like Sutekh, she needed the Toymaker off the table.
5. The Doctor went back to 10's face because of... Mrs Flood.  She needed the Toymaker gone so she had to make sure The Doctor went to the edge of the Universe to draw him out, for that she needed Donna in the Tardis to coffee things up, for that she needed The Doctor and Donna to reconcile, and for that she needed to make it near impossible for The Doctor to hide from Donna. Giving him his old face, then making him bump into her as an alien space crashes nearby... how unlikely... and how could he resist?
6. Mrs Flood has trapped The Doctor in a new reality which is actually a form of TV show - and she's the show runner. This is how she can control the story and how The Doctor now knows about non-diegetic music being played. (Depending on how long he's been trapped, may be why he's more aware of 'canon' now too.) This is the reason why the series numbering has been reset, this is actually a new series at the end of which The Doctor will return to reality and pick up at the end of Series 13.
7. The Doctor will be reunited with Susan.

From the walls to the lighting, everything should reflect an old-world charm. One of the most important aspects of achieving this look is selecting the right furniture. Antique-style pieces bring elegance, history, and warmth to any space, making guests feel like they have stepped into another era.

Choosing the perfect designs can be challenging, especially with so many options available. Understanding different styles, materials, and finishes is essential to creating an authentic atmosphere. In this blog, we will explore how to select the best furniture to give a hotel a timeless and elegant vintage appeal.

# Understanding Antique-Style Furniture

# 1. What Defines Vintage Designs?

Antique-style furniture is inspired by past eras, often reflecting craftsmanship and intricate detailing. These pieces are typically made from solid wood, featuring ornate carvings, rich finishes, and classic upholstery. Some designs also include metal accents, glass panels, or hand-painted details that add character.

Different periods, such as Victorian, Baroque, or Art Deco, have distinct characteristics. Choosing a specific era or blending elements from multiple styles helps in achieving the desired look. Whether the goal is a royal palace feel or a cozy countryside charm, selecting the right pieces makes a significant impact.

# 2. Importance of Quality Materials

Authentic antique-style furniture is made from high-quality materials such as mahogany, oak, teak, and walnut. These woods are known for their durability and beautiful grain patterns. Upholstered pieces often feature luxurious fabrics like velvet, leather, or brocade, which enhance the vintage appeal.

Metal accents, including brass, wrought iron, and bronze, add elegance and durability. Handcrafted details such as inlays, gold leafing, and tufted cushions further elevate the overall aesthetic. Investing in well-made pieces ensures long-lasting beauty and functionality.

# Choosing the Right Pieces

# 1. Statement Sofas and Armchairs

A vintage hotel lobby should feel inviting and luxurious. A classic sofa with curved legs, button-tufted upholstery, and rolled arms creates a grand impression. Wingback chairs or high-back armchairs with carved wooden frames add sophistication and comfort.

For a more relaxed setting, chesterfield designs with deep tufting and nailhead trim are perfect. Choosing rich colors like burgundy, emerald green, or royal blue enhances the antique charm. Mixing textures such as velvet and leather provides depth and visual interest.

# 2. Elegant Wooden Tables

Tables play a vital role in both aesthetics and functionality. Coffee tables with carved legs and glass tops create a refined look. Dining areas should feature large wooden tables with ornate details, matching the overall theme. Pedestal bases or cabriole legs add a touch of old-world charm.

Side tables with marble tops, brass handles, or painted floral motifs work well in guest rooms. Bedside pieces with antique brass lamps complete the vintage ambiance, offering both style and practicality.

# 3. Classic Beds for a Regal Feel

Hotel rooms should feel luxurious and comfortable. A four-poster bed with intricate carvings or a tufted headboard in rich upholstery adds elegance. Canopy designs with flowing curtains bring a romantic and sophisticated touch.

Wooden bed frames with inlaid patterns or gold accents give a royal appearance. Pairing them with matching nightstands and dressers creates a cohesive and stylish look. Soft lighting and vintage-style bedding enhance the overall experience for guests.

# 4. Antique-Style Cabinets and Wardrobes

Storage solutions should be both practical and visually appealing. Wardrobes with detailed carvings, mirrored doors, or brass handles fit perfectly in a vintage-themed hotel. Wooden chests and cabinets with ornate patterns provide additional storage while enhancing the decor.

For a more authentic touch, distressed finishes or hand-painted floral designs bring character and charm. These elements make each piece unique and add a sense of history to the space.

# 5. Decorative Accents and Accessories

Small details make a significant difference in creating an antique-inspired setting. Vintage-style mirrors with gold or silver frames add elegance to hallways and bedrooms. Wall clocks with Roman numerals and metal pendulums enhance the classic appeal.

Candle holders, chandeliers, and table lamps with crystal or brass elements contribute to the old-world atmosphere. Rugs with intricate patterns and rich colors tie the entire theme together. Adding these decorative touches ensures a truly immersive vintage experience.

# Selecting the Right Suppliers

# 1. Finding Authentic Craftsmanship

Choosing reliable furniture manufacturers in Delhi is essential for sourcing high-quality antique-style pieces. Skilled artisans and workshops in the city specialize in creating handcrafted designs that replicate historical aesthetics. Visiting showrooms or working with trusted suppliers ensures the best selection.

Customization options allow businesses to tailor pieces according to specific themes and dimensions. Working with experienced manufacturers guarantees durability, authenticity, and attention to detail.

# 2. Checking Material Quality and Finishing

Before purchasing, it is important to examine the materials and craftsmanship. Solid wood should have a smooth finish, sturdy joints, and natural grain patterns. Upholstery fabrics must be of high quality, resistant to wear, and easy to maintain.

Metal elements should be rust-free and well-polished. Painted or distressed finishes should appear natural rather than artificial. Carefully selecting each piece ensures consistency in design and long-lasting appeal.

# 3. Balancing Cost and Quality

Investing in antique-style furniture does not always mean spending a fortune. Comparing different suppliers and exploring bulk purchase discounts can help manage costs. Some manufacturers offer customized solutions at competitive prices, making it easier to achieve the desired look without exceeding the budget.

It is essential to prioritize durability over cheap alternatives. Well-made furniture lasts for decades, making it a valuable long-term investment. Choosing timeless designs also prevents the need for frequent replacements.

# Maintaining Antique-Style Furniture

# 1. Regular Cleaning and Care

Proper maintenance keeps furniture looking beautiful for years. Wooden surfaces should be dusted regularly with a soft cloth. Using mild cleaning solutions prevents damage to finishes and protects the natural texture.

Upholstered pieces should be vacuumed to remove dust and dirt. Leather items require conditioning to maintain softness and prevent cracking. Metal accents can be polished occasionally to retain their shine.

# 2. Protecting Against Damage

To prevent scratches, placing coasters under glasses and using table runners is recommended. Avoiding direct sunlight helps preserve the color and quality of wood and fabric. Keeping furniture away from moisture prevents warping and deterioration.

Regular inspections help identify any minor issues before they become serious. Tightening screws, fixing loose joints, and reapplying protective coatings ensure longevity.

# 3. Restoring and Refinishing

Over time, some pieces may require restoration. Polishing wood, reupholstering seats, or repainting decorative elements refresh the appearance without losing authenticity. Consulting professional restorers ensures that original charm is maintained while enhancing durability.

# Conclusion

Choosing antique-style furniture for a vintage hotel creates a unique and memorable experience for guests. By selecting high-quality materials, elegant designs, and authentic craftsmanship, businesses can achieve a timeless look. Investing in well-made sofas, tables, beds, and decorative elements transforms spaces into elegant retreats.

https://reddit.com/link/1it1it5/video/7p2y1llmnd7e1/player

Hi everyone!  
After using several different laptop brands, I must say that Lenovo's Legion series has one of the best thermal designs. For most cases, simply elevating the base, keeping the laptop clean, regularly repasting thermal paste, and using it in a clean environment will keep it cool. If you want further optimization, debloating Windows, undervolting CPU/GPU, and adding a cooling stand is more than sufficient.

However, watercooling is not exactly ‚Äúbudget-friendly‚Äù or ‚Äúnewbie-friendly,‚Äù and modding a Legion laptop for watercooling isn‚Äôt really necessary. I did it mainly for the joy of DIY, so if you enjoy modding as much as I do, this is for you.

# Concept and Design

Inspired by the XMG Neo 16‚Äôs watercooling setup, I created a *plug-in watercooling mod*. It‚Äôs completely detachable, portable for work or a coffee shop, doesn‚Äôt require soldering or invasive modifications, and can easily revert to stock configuration. Plus, it‚Äôs reusable for other laptops with minor adjustments if you upgrade or switch devices.

I purchased an extra bottom cover, cut holes, and applied pressure on a waterblock (similar to RAM cooling blocks) against the vapor chamber of my Legion Pro 7. I used *putty* for the thermal interface. An AIO system with a **30W pump, 240mm radiator, dual 3000 RPM fans**, and a water tank circulates coolant through the waterblock via **quick-disconnect fittings** for easy installation and removal.

https://preview.redd.it/c8fm4bjxnd7e1.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a35f1c47b403b4683b7838abbff5bf8ae6e66f9d

https://preview.redd.it/kvlkdajxnd7e1.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77a4bf79a9d6d4dee40a9f15959185fed5c2e51e

https://preview.redd.it/3d3jqajxnd7e1.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a79660a63eeeb271e3aa67f416bc16880dba0edf

**Hardware used:**

* **Custom CNC coldplate**: Standard RAM blocks have a 4mm thick coldplate, but the Legion Pro 7 only has a 2mm gap, which can put unwanted pressure on the vapor chamber. I had a custom **2.5mm coldplate** designed. Alternatively, you can use the EK Monarch RAM block (2.7mm thickness) for an easier, budget-friendly solution. I can also share CNC-ready acrylic designs if needed.

**Note:** While direct cooling to CPU/GPU would be more effective, this mod only cools the vapor chamber (acting like the IHS), so stock fans remain operational, and portability is preserved.

# Installation and Reverting to Stock

All components are mounted on the custom bottom cover. To revert to stock:

1. Remove the modded cover.
2. Wipe off the putty (reusable).
3. Attach the original cover.

Reinstalling the watercooling is just as easy: reapply the putty and mount the modded cover. And voil√† ‚Äî your Legion Pro 7 becomes what I call the *Legion Pro 10*! üòÑ

# Cooling Performance in Games

With this mod, I recorded **GPU temperatures dropping by 20-24¬∞C** and **CPU by 23-29¬∞C**, depending on the game. All tests were performed in **custom mode, tuned software, and 4K+ resolution (3840x2400)** to push the laptop near its design limit (\~230-240W CPU+GPU combined). Actual temperatures will be even lower during regular use.

Stress tests also showed reduced temperatures for RAM and SSD, proving that cooling the CPU/GPU vapor chamber indirectly benefits other components.

I (28F) am 5‚Äô3 and have always been pretty active, but over the past two years, my weight went from 135 lbs to 164 lbs. I went off of birth control, and my body started going cuckoo. It was hard to see, because I could still fit into a majority of my clothes, but looking back at photos, my goodness weight blindness is a thing. During this time frame, I also was very depressed and in a relationship where I was drinking a lot and eating poorly. About a year ago, I started running again and gained a lot of muscle, but somehow was weighing in at 164 lbs. I haven‚Äôt drank alcohol since July, but what actually made me lose weight recently was discovering that my boyfriend of two years had cheated on me back in November. 

Since November, I have gone from 164 lbs to 144 lbs (a majority of that stemming from the side effects of heartbreak and walking many miles a day to cope). I‚Äôm determined to get back to my toned, 130 to 135 lbs days. I‚Äôve slowly weened back into mat pilates and just renewed my cycling membership. Due to health reasons, my doctor has urged me not to run anymore (due to it being a lonesome exercise/I don‚Äôt do run clubs haha), so that was an adjustment since it was a major outlet for me. 

To note, my appetite is finally getting back to normal after dealing with severe GI/inflammatory issues over the past year. I‚Äôve always drank a lot of water, I don‚Äôt drink alcohol anymore, and I drink black coffee or peppermint tea without anything added. I‚Äôve cut back on a lot of gluten (my weakness) as well. I‚Äôm seeking any advice to help me get through my plateau in a healthy way (fitness wise and diet wise). I‚Äôm still going through a lot of medical testing, that has now gotten me a referral to the Rheumatologist, so hopefully that can help alleviate certain issues moving forward.

Hi, 

I‚Äôm 34M from Britain (East Midlands in England). I‚Äôm open to meeting new people to hang out and socialise with, and making new friends. I am a caring, kind, honest, loyal, patient, and sociable person and it would be great to meet other people with the same qualities. It would be great to build close male friendships with other guys, where you can chat/call, and socialise in person. I am particularly keen to meet other guys from Britain, as it would be great to have a friend who is in same country geographically, and where you can chat and meet up in person  regularly where possible and do different social activities together, e.g going to gym/working out, playing sports together, going to socialise at pubs and restaurants etc, going out for coffee etc. 

My interests and hobbies include (but are not limited to): playing sports (badminton, squash, table tennis etc); fitness/gym; watching movies 
(my favourite film genre is horror movies); reading; socialising; going out for coffees; going out for dinner; going to pubs and clubs; learning about new languages and cultures; cooking; playing pool, and bowling; travelling and sightseeing; gaming etc. 

If anyone is interested in chatting and looking for the same thing, or feels they may share some of the same interests or values as me, please feel free to send me a message anytime. It would be great to hear from you, and chat and connect.

My goal with this is to not force what Kendu is down your throat, I want you to form your own opinion and let this serve as an introduction.

  
Okay, moving on to the title. Recently, we have seen relentless rugging on the Solana blockchain where public figures are extracting millions upon millions of liquidity out of memecoin traders/investors. The recent Libra rug which was done by the OFFICIAL government of Argentina reached billions of volume meaning these billions were essentially stolen from us. Even today, Dave Portnoy launched a coin called $GREED and rugged it after explicitly saying he wouldn't sell. I could go on forever but as I said, I want this post to be short.

My point is though, if you are buying memecoins lately chances are you've been incredibly rekt and lost a lot of money. Personally I have gone through many public forums such as telegram lounges, crypto twitter etc and seen a lot of people fairly upset about this and there seemingly being no light at the end of the tunnel. This will eventually lead to a mass exodus of the memecoin space leaving very little liquidity behind meaning all real projects will suffer. 

This made me think... the people obviously need a saviour, but this saviour may not be in the form you might expect. Many people expect someone like Murad to come forth and lead them to salvation, which in my opinion just simply is not possible. But what if I told you that your saviour can come in the form of a huge group of people lifting each other up?

Welcome to Kendu, your saviour is here. We are completely organic without any paid marketing, artificial candles on the chart and simply no bullshit. Our community members come from all around the globe and have joined forces to create this movement. Some members have already made their mark on the world through their own initiatives such as a Kendu branded energy drink, Kendu coffee, leaving stickers in public areas, making unhinged irl shilling videos and so much more. 

This is the saviour DeFi needs. Real people with good intentions pushing a movement.

I grew up in a very rural area where we didn't brush our teeth often and relied on a yearly dentist trailer to come to our area and do cleanings/check/etc. 
So because of lack of education, personal issues, and just how it goes - I used to only brush my teeth every 5 days or so (until recently when I started doing it daily!) I never felt pain or anything when I was not brushing them regularly but I did use mouthwash daily and flossed when I brushed. 

The last time I went to a dentist was in 2007. I had 3 cavities and the dentist did NOT use any numbing on them. No gas. No needles. It was not a fun experience. 

I do not smoke except the once or twice a year social cigarette.
I drink coffee daily
No medical issues I'm aware of
I have never had my wisdom teeth come up (I am 27 years old now) and I've not got pain anywhere in my mouth even when I floss
No dental surgery records

Bago siya ipasa ng gf ko sa akin, my gf asked her already kung ok lang na canva ang gamit since that's what I use and ok lang naman daw kay client. May photos na siya so layout and design nalang daw ang gagawin ko. I quoted her 1500 for 20 pages since sabi niya 20 pages lang daw. She asked me if I can finish it asap and I said yes. 

Feb 1, I gave her my email so she can share sa gdrive yung pics. What she shared to me contains 80+ folder (artist) and sabi niya pili raw ako 2-3 photos per artist. That is 80+ artist so it'll be more or less 164 photos if I'll edit 2-3 photos each of them. I tried to renegotiate dahil syempre, hindi yun kasya sa 20 pages na sinasabi niya. Sabi ko I want it to be 3k kahit lugi ako sobra doon pero sabi niya 2,500 lang daw. Edi sabi ko lugi ako doon since sa isang client ko, 300 ako per poster. Then nag-go na siya.

Feb 2, I started it agad. Nung makailang page na ako, I sent her the draft to ask her kung ok ba siya sa design, and also reminded her na I'll ask for a downpayment. She replied na wednesday (feb 5) niya raw sana ako bayaran ng full but she's rushing me to finish it in 2-3 days. Nasa bakasyon daw kasi siya and Feb 5 pa ang balik niya. Sabi ko hindi pwede and I need a downpayment para sure din ako. I said willing ako to finish it asap pero kung sa Wed pa siya makakabigay ng downpayment, doon ko nalang itutuloy.

Feb 3, she tried to renegotiate. She said na hindi niya raw need yung 80+ artist na malagay sa book since ang gusto daw niya ay 25-30 pages lang. I asked her to edit the file she shared sa akin para tanggalin yung mga hindi need. Since mababawasan, I know na ire-renogotiate niya rin yung price so inunahan ko na na 2.5k ang last offer ko. Sabi niya 2k lang daw pero hindi ko na binigay since sayang din yung naumpisahan ko na kasi paiba-iba siya. She agreed naman na 2.5k na talaga then she asked na if ever may revisions, ok lang daw ba. For me kasi, I don't do unli revision. Kapag napagkasunduan yung design, that's it and if they want magpa-edit, that will be an additional payment. So sabi ko sa kaniya, I will send her naman the drafts and kung goods siya sa design, margins etc., then that's what I'll do sa lahat ng page. Once na naipasa ko sa kaniya yung whole work, may 1 day siya to check it. Kung may ipapa-edit, maximum free edit of 3 pages. Kapag lampas 3 pages, ‚Ç±70 per page. Sabi niya ok daw as long as may maipakita akong draft para matignan niya yung design.

Feb 5, I sent her the drafts and the different designs I made. She said ok siya sa margin and design. She also asked if real account ko ba (fb) yung gamit ko since 18 friends lang. I said yes kasi hindi talaga ako naga-add or accept ng friend request nang wala lang, I am very private sa socmed. 

She's always telling me na ako na bahala sa design blah blah blah. Maybe because ayaw niya maistorbo sa bakasyon niya. Anyways, Feb 5 siya nag-send ng dp 1,250. She even said na dapat daw quality para if ever na may ipagawa, ako na ang kukunin niya. Doon ko nalaman na she's outsourcing me pala to do her task which is I don't mind. Feb 5, tinanong niya na agad ako if pwede ko matapos kinabukasan which is Feb 6. Need niya na raw kasi mga gabi so nira-rush niya talaga ako which is ok lang kasi wala naman akong ibang project that time. 

Feb 6 3:23pm, I sent her the whole work. Sabi niya ipapa-approve niya raw sa client niya and she'll update me raw mga gabi since American time. Naguluhan ako kasi I thought approved na nila yung draft na ginawa ko but ipapa-approve ulit. But I didn't say anything, sabi ko lang sige. 

Feb 7 6:41pm niya na ako nabalikan. Sabi niya may mga gusto raw ipatanggal and ipa-add na pics. So I asked agad which pics para magawa ko na. Sabi niya she'll update me nalang daw ulit since mahina ang signal niya dahil nasa bakasyon siya. Mind you, sabi niya sa akin Feb 5 ang uwi niya galing bakasyon pero Feb 7 nasa bakasyon pa rin siya. 

Feb 8 - Feb 10, nagf-follow up ako sa kaniya. I reminded her about my terms na since it's been 4 days since I passed her the project, kung may e-edit man, 3 lang ang free and I'll charge her ‚Ç±70 per extra pages. She replied Feb 10 1:06pm saying ""Hi. Sabi ko po nasa vacation ako. Pauwi palang po ako. Wala akong signal kasi nag bundok ako. Asikasuhin ko to later pag ka uwi."" And I said na no worries kasi nire-remind ko lang naman siya. 

Feb 11 - Feb 15, nagf-follow up pa rin ako. Lagpas 1 week na nung naipasa ko yung project and I'm asking her to settle her balance. Nakakainis din na nakikita kong nago-online naman siya pero hindi niya ako nire-replyan. Feb 15 3:20pm, she replied na busy raw kasi sila sa ibang project. First reason niya nasa vacation siya and suddenly, busy na siya sa ibang project. She said na medyo hindi nagustuhan ng client since ang initial request daw ay lightroom dapat ang gamit sa pag-edit. Second, gusto raw kahit may small name yung artist sa gilid. Third, papalitan yung ibang photos. Nainis ako kasi lahat ng reklamo niya ay naitanong ko na sa kaniya before I start working on the project. My gf asked her kung may text, she said wala and pics lang. Nung kami na magkausap, I asked her again kung may text, wala talaga. And before we started, she agreed sa canva. And I've been following up to her kung ano yung mga need tanggalin na pics but she's not replying. I still replied nang maayos tho I said na hindi excuse na naka-focus siya sa ibang project when she rushed me to do something and I did it right away pero kapag oras na ng payment, hindi ko na siya makausap. Hindi na siya nag-reply niyan.

Feb 16 - Feb 18 (kahapon), i keep on following up kasi hindi niya ako nirereplyan. I saw her post sa Valorant PH 2 days and 1 day ago. May time mag-valo pero walang time mag-reply sa akin? I screenshot her post and sent to her. Wala pang isang minuto, nag-seen na siya. Sabi niya ise-send niya raw bukas yung mga need i-edit pati yung payment. Sabi ko no, I need the payment now since I wasted enough time waiting for her reply. I got mad kasi ginagago niya ako intentionally ignoring me. I also said na maghanap na siya ng ibang editor. 

Then she started blaming me. Sabi niya she gave me an inspo naman daw. Medyo napahiya raw kasi siya sa client. Parang sinumbat niya na pa na she even paid me the half first which is yun naman talaga dapat. She said na ipapa-approve daw sa client pero hindi raw talaga nagustuhan. This is my reply:

""but you approved it. i told you everything, i gave you the look of the pages and margins. i said gusto kong approve sa inyo before I continue. yoh approved it kahit hindi naman pala kayo ang need mag-approve. napahiya ka dahil sayo.

you outsourced me to do your task and I did it with your approval. settle your balance.""

then nag-bump siya ng chat niya sa akin where she said na ipapa-approve niya sa client. so I bumped 3 chats wherein she approved the drafts. but still, pinaglalaban niya na sinabi niya raw na ipapa-approve niya muna sa client. here's my reply,

""after you approved it and after i finished everything? kung sila pala ang may final say, you should've sent them the drafts I sent to you first. that's what the drafts are for. you approved it kahit hindi naman pala ikaw ang may final say. and now hindi nila nagustuhan, you want me to revise it with the same payment?"" 

tapos sabi niya gawin ko raw yung last edit. pumayag ako pero sabi ko i-settle niya muna yung balance since wala na akong tiwala. she said ""fine para tapos na"" so sabi ko I'm waiting then hindi nanaman siya nagre-reply. so I chatted her na I'll wait until 5pm then she replied ""wow. Di mo naisip nasa trabaho yung tao?"" then she blocked me.

sobrang kapal ng mukha for her to think na may pake ako sa time niya when she made me wait for how many days for her reply. I chatted her using my gf's messenger pero nagpakilala ako. I said na sending the payment will only take less than 5 mins and don't expect na may pake ako sa oras niya since ganon yung ginawa niya sa akin.


sorry this is such a long read. but inis na inis talaga ako until now. I know her gf's fb and ig nila pareho. this is not about the money anymore and I wanna let go pero hindi ko matanggap yung kakapalan ng mukha niya. 

any advice? may mali ba ako? what would you do kung ikaw ang nasa situation ko?

I'm convinced there is a gap in the market, and I'm thinking of taking some courses and starting a side gig fixing residential machines (for a ¬£50 fee going to houses to fix machines to build some experience). If that works, going full time and working with local companies. Perhaps one off fixes, or offering maintenance contracts year on year.

  
The question I have is how do coffee shops, restaurants etc. keep their machines maintained? I don't know if you're leasing these machines and manufacturers are providing a maintenance service so I'll have no chance, or if there's a need for someone (""oh it'll cost me ¬£500 and 2 days to get the manufacturer in, but I can call a local guy for ¬£350 and he can be here this afternoon""). Or perhaps you buy these machines outright and pay a big yearly fee for call outs etc?

What‚Äôs That About?,"Then there was that bombshell statement of John 6  that drove the crowds away! The crowds had shown up for a free meal and were steadily disappointed because Jesus just wanted to talk about spiritual stuff‚Äîbut then he finally reached this next corker, and it drove them all away:

‚ÄúWhoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life, and I will resurrect him on the last day; for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.‚Äù (John 6:54)

Whoa! They didn‚Äôt see that coming! ‚ÄúWhen they heard this, many of his disciples said: ‚ÄòThis speech is shocking; who can listen to it?‚Äô‚Äù (6:60)

Now, Jesus had been setting the stage for some time but they hadn‚Äôt been listening. It‚Äôs like when my wife suddenly drops a grenade on me that will set me back a half year‚Äôs salary and when I spit out my coffee in horror she says, ‚ÄòWell, I‚Äôve been speaking for weeks about it! You might try paying attention on occasion!‚Äù

Jesus had been doing that too. It was another thing explored during that Watchtower Study of February 16, 2025: ‚ÄúYou Can Have Everlasting Life‚ÄîBut How?‚Äù He had fed the crowds. The next day they showed up for more. He told them: ‚ÄúMost truly I say to you, you are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate from the loaves and were satisfied. (6:26)
 
What did he advise them to do instead?

‚ÄúWork, not for the food that perishes, but for the food that remains for everlasting life, which the Son of man will give you.‚Äù (6:27)

Then, he referred back to how God fed the ancestors with ‚Äòbread from heaven.‚Äô It was called manna. (6:31) The stuff was versatile and nourishing, but in time the grumblers grew sick of it. Then he said that he was the counterpart of that heavenly bread: ‚ÄúI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will not get hungry at all, and whoever exercises faith in me will never get thirsty at all. (6:35)

Okay? So, he gave plenty of notice where he was heading. Same thing with the ‚Äúdrink.‚Äù He had told the woman at the well that those ‚Äúwho drink from the water I give will never thirst again‚Äù and that woman ran off to tell the whole town. (4:14) It is enough for the crowds to have said, ‚ÄúOkay, he talks that way.‚Äù It‚Äôs on them if they‚Äôre going to choke afterward, which most of them did: ‚ÄúBecause of this, many of his disciples went off to the things behind and would no longer walk with him.‚Äù (6:66)

***

Now, having said all this, it is a fact that among the slanderous things said about early Christians was that they practiced cannibalism. And don‚Äôt you think their enemies would have pointed to these words of Jesus to make their case? How could they not? The words can be so easily misconstrued. I know it‚Äôs the Lord and all, but it seems like a very impolitic thing to say. 

Moreover, if Witness organization ever said something so seemingly provocative, their opponents would be blasting them for years over it! Such as with a Watchtower that called certain apostates ‚Äúmentally diseased,‚Äù citing a scripture that says exactly that. That was 14 years ago and they are still howling about It! 

Sometimes the Witness channel will say something true enough on the surface but easily misconstrued (like calls for ‚Äúobedience‚Äù) and I will say, ‚ÄúSheesh! You guys don‚Äôt know how easily that can be weaponized?!‚Äù But I don‚Äôt write in to tell them about it. I am afraid they might say, ‚ÄúYeah. Well . . . Jesus did it. Why don‚Äôt you trying telling him off, Tom?‚Äù

Frankly, I‚Äôll bet they use Jesus‚Äô remarks as a template, same as they do Acts 15 for their own role. They probably go there and conclude, ‚ÄúOkay, you say what needs to be said. Never mind if the soreheads twist it around.‚Äù They probably don‚Äôt want to find themselves in the shoes of Lot, whose sons-in-law thought he was joking. If they think something needs saying, they say it. But it sure does make life . . . interesting.",1,1739956380.0,Eutychus,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone,


I am a male in my 30s, and I am from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, Britain (England). I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. üôÇ

But today I felt tired and had a headache even after getting good night's sleep yesterday. And i really needed to work on something important so can't take a long break.

So I thought of trying out some coffee and kid you not, within 15-30 mins I'm back to working like normal. I mean is this what people feel everyday?

Obviously I've had coffee before, even when I'm in the office but it rarely does anything substantial for me in terms of productivity, it's only the taste that I like. 

So, this is just a dumb discovery for me of why other people need coffee, couldn't really understand what they meant by this. I just liked the taste similar to any other beverage.",3,1739956289.0,RandomThoughts,7,1.0,False

I was told here in reddit that i have Familial Hypercholesterolemia and i panicked... i contacted with my GP who prescribed me Rousvastatin 10 mg **which i did not take yet**. I tried to take my numbers as down as i can with only dietary changes and started to inculde more cardio in my weighlifting gym sessions. I'm kinda don't know what should i do, to take the Statin for a few months and keep my numbers in range with only diet later on or do not take the meds and only continue my lifestyle changes.

So the numbers:

[45 days](https://preview.redd.it/osiokqx6b2ke1.jpg?width=836&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4b054b21f2d5591e31a739db6ef802acdfa5c2c)

My diet changes:

* Completely stop dairy, milk.. i ate like 3-4 slices of Gouda the past 1 month.
* Completely stop red meat and pork.
* Completely stop sweets, sugars.
* Mostly stop alcohol (a few times i drink like a glass of red wine a few evenings)
* Eating only chicken breasts a few times.
* Switched Coffee to Matcha.
* Eating a lot of salmon, pollock, tuna (frozen and from a can too)
* Eating a lot of brown rice, sweet-potatoes, broccoli, cauliflower and fresh veggies and avocado.
* Eating brown bread, wholemeal and sourdogh bread.
* Eating a lot of porridge with fruits. Mostly apple, banana and berries.
* Eating a lots of cashews, nut mixes and walnuts.
* While eating out i mostly ordered Pho or Ramen or Pad-Thai with Tofu.
* The first in the morning is drinking a glass of water with a big spoon of Psyllium husk.
* Started to take a lots of vitamins: B complex, C, D, Selen, Iodine
* Supplements: creatine, collagen, cholin, aswhagandha.
* Important supplement for anyone which affects liver: Milk Thislte.

Started to run for like 3-5 km every other day, maybe like 3-4 times a week.  
Thats it.

I hope my experience can help someone.

Tho, i would like an advice about taking the statin or not or some explanation about how the hell my numbers go down so drastically in just 45 days... is that still can be Familial Hypercholesterolemia or the problem caused by my trash diet with a lot of fatty meat and sweets, and drinking alcohol in october, december?

I don't really know how to start this because of how burnt out my mind has been for the past month & a half, the title I guess is a good start. I apologize in advance if it ends up being disjointed

We met in our first year of High School, I was even more naive than I am now & we kinda realized we weren't on the same wavelength so it faded after 2 months & I didn't think I'd see her again.

Flash forward to late 2023 & she gets hired at my job, same department & we reconnect. She was in a very long term relationship that she was very vocal about fizzling out & I had just gotten out of a prior but way less serious thing myself so we kinda connected **too** well over that. Long story short, we were together from the second they broke it off which is something I realize should've been a red flag in hindsight (fucking hindsight, man)

We were officially together for only just over a year and I wholeheartedly realize that's a drop in the bucket for a lot of you here and for a lifetime in general but the sparks flew, the idea of that fairy tale-high school romance hubbaloo was the only thing in my head so I was kind of blinded. That's the reasoning for the title.

It's great for the first 4-5 months, in that time I help her move into a new place, things transpired & I left my job in winter under the impression I had interviews set up but (this is totally my fault) none of them even happened. She was very understanding & every moment I spent at her new place I would do the chores, make her coffee & breakfast before she even woke up, typical & basic boyfriend stuff. I also had savings for a short amount of time so I wasn't just on her couch when not doing busywork

Let me preface this part by saying she was the type, & I love(d) this about her, to follow me anywhere but any time applying for EI/welfare came up she would tell me that it was ""something I have to figure out on my own"" which always left me with both a sinking & burning in my gut as I just wanted my partner for moral support.

It was around here that we both started to drink a bit heavier than we used to, stop going out as much, arguing more, passive aggressive comments. I admittedly became just low & let it affect my time spent with her, I felt like & frankly was becoming a deadbeat. I also took note but didn't make a big deal about it, that she hid her relationship info on all socials & didn't have a picture of me or anything we did together on any of them nor was her pfp one of us (I know, so juvenile but sometimes these things count for something)

I knew & still know I was trying my hardest to pick up whatever slack I could but only now do I realize how easily people in her life & she herself could perceive me incredibly negatively & rightfully so

Flash-forward to this past fall, I'm still job hunting. We had a few more spats. The main one being that I had taken up a youth coaching position & she said ""I don't know why you're doing that, you don't even get anything out of it."" off the bat cuz it doesn't pay. To hear that your passion/hobby & the one thing getting you out of the house at the time meant nothing to your partner.

It's at this point we are bickering once a week over the smallest things, almost looking for flaws in each other, typical communication breakdown. She would frankly overshare details of our relationship to her half-sister who would then throw it all in my face whenever she'd drink & I was around...

This is getting pretty self-pitying for what is basically puppy love compared to what a lot of you go through so I'll wrap it up. Christmas comes, I found temporary work so I could at least get her something nice, I notice my name is not on any of the cards addressed to her & ""our"" cat but didn't make a big deal out of it (there's that fuckin' hindsight again) New Year's was great between us, I got her a beautiful ring that she was eyeballing. About a week or so after that, big fight cuz I admittedly had a few morning brews & didn't feel fit to go over to her place, it spiraled into an argument & I will admit this was not the first time I had unfortunately pulled that shit on her. We agreed to part ways.

We exchanged what we had to 2 days later, I told her at the car I would always care about her & I was sorry it went down that way. I fell into a dark place & basically just drank and smoked for 4 days, snapped out of it, showered.

Got drunk again that night, made the **\*ROOKIE\*** mistake of checking out some of her socials, & seeing that she was already moved on to someone new. We were broken up so I can't be too mad plus look at how fast the turnaround was when we got together, I'm an asshole not a hypocrite.

She was out of sight, out of mind, I cut back on the booze after my little stupor, got hired on the spot at a new job, I felt surprisingly good until on my 2nd day of work she just so happened to be in my new workplace & we made eye contact. This was very uncomfortable to me because she lives a township away with 3 stores near her house, plus she works at a similar store with a discount... regardless it put me right back to square one ever since.

Checked her socials again on the most recent holiday & saw she's already living with the new guy or at least has a key after about a month.

That's totally self-inflicted, almost all of the situation I'm in is & I genuinely will be seeking therapy because I do not wanna be that guy in any way shape or form, I want to move on and pick myself up & her to have whatever semblance of happiness she needs/wants, which honestly it seems like she may have found that already and while it stings, I will put a face on and say that I'm happy for her.

I will not diagnose myself before I get help but I'd say just based on how long I've made this post about skeletons in my closet tends to make me think I'm a bit self-centered. No Contact means No Contact that's something I have to start respecting both for her & myself to be quite honest. I have no way of drunk texting or having that avenue of ""how are you doing"" months from now which is honestly for the best and I should embrace it instead of hurting myself more & frankly, getting obsessive.

Any night I have a dream it's a dream about either getting back together with her or a memory we made together to the point I don't even want to risk it despite being dead-tired.

I'm fairly young, still have time to get back on the horse & get my life together but old enough to be a bit more emotionally mature & plain respectful than I should've been if that helps break the ice on how much sympathy I'm expecting which is not a lot. I really did not mean to treat this post like it's a journal, I already have been doing that as well but sometimes it feels cathartic to say it into the void. I have a lot of working on myself to do.

This has happened under load and also while idol where it's working fine and I go make a coffee and come back and it's frozen.

I am also getting issues with my AIO and RGB on some fans where they are stuck on dim and the AIO has no logo lighting up. And finally my monitors have been slowly getting worse where I boot the PC and one power cycles for about 5 minutes before finally being recognised and the other turns on but shows a black screen unless I turn it on and off a few times (each time I get a flash of my desktop but the screen then goes blank, seems like just a visual thing).

I first tried swapping out the power strip to the wall with a brand new one thinking it was power delivery issues, that didn't work so I tried a new PSU, same issues persisted. During this time I also upgraded my ram but had issues before and after the upgrade.

I have also just replaced the motherboard and still having the exact same issues.
I just had a 10 min cinebench stress test finish for the CPU which hasn't caused any crashes.

The last thing I haven't really tested was the GPU but even with it removed and not connected to the monitors at all I'd have the monitor power cycle and the fans / AIO still not changing at all. The fans have a manual controller that they plug into before the sata which can change the brightness / colour and pressing the buttons does nothing with or without the GPU in. 

Finally I have swapped out the sata cables and the CPU cable into the mobo to no avail. 

I am at a loss as to what to do next since I had an electrician out to check the power in the house since I noticed an issue elsewhere with the bathroom fan dropping to low voltage occasionally but having someone come out and fix the powerline on the street with a grounding fault has solved that but not the issues I am seeing here.

Yet fate is a cruel mistress, for his beloved daughter lingers upon the threshold of life and death, beyond the reach of mortal healers.

Through years of desperate seeking, word has reached him of ancient artefacts that may yet restore his child to wholeness. Bound by love and duty, Thaddeus may not forsake her side, and so he sends forth a summons across the land. He seeks those of courage, those of might, those whose hearts are bold and whose wills unyielding.

Every digital marketer knows the grind of crafting that perfect Meta ad description: it has to be catchy, concise, and convert. Enter the CAPM Tool for Marketers - a web-based wizard that's like having your very own AI-powered copywriter. ü§ñ‚úçÔ∏è

What's it do? It takes the details of your product or service, mashes them with your target audience's desires, and outputs ad copy that ticks all the right boxes for Meta's advertising platform. The best part? It's tailored to your brand's voice, whether you're all business or keeping it casual.

Let's say you're launching a trendy eco-friendly coffee mug. Just plug in your product details, mention that your audience is eco-conscious millennials, and voil√†! You get ad copy that could read: ""Keep your beverages warm and the planet cool with our new EcoMug!"" Add in your CTA preference, like ""Order now for a greener tomorrow,"" and your ad is ready to roll out.

And for those times when writer's block hits or Meta's ad compliance feels like a maze, the CAPM Tool is the ace up your sleeve.

It's not just for products either ‚Äì local yoga studios, SaaS platforms, and anyone else looking to ace their Meta advertising game stand to benefit.
