Made the switch during the hysteria of COVID in fear that my lungs would be compromised from vaping. I tried to quit a few months ago but the brain fog/dissociation was so bad that I couldn’t get anything done at work. Decided to postpone quitting until my vacation (which began two days ago). Instead of going “cold turkey” this time I’m stepping down each day. Sunday: 5 pouches, Monday: 4 pouches, so on and so forth. Today I’m “allowed” 2 pouches. The cravings were much worse on Sunday and Monday, but haven’t really been an issue since. Once again the “brain fog” / fever-dream-reality is much more of a concern. It goes away within minutes of my first “allowed” pouch of the day. I think this “step down” method is much more manageable than quitting all at once. Biggest thing I’ve tried to do is use the pouches at atypical times (i.e. no zyn with morning coffee or after a meal). instead, battle that urge and wait until the brain fog is so bad that I can’t participate in a conversation. I also find myself thinking about how I’m quitting constantly; really dwelling on it… some vacation im having lol, but if i come out of it being off the stuff or at least down to 1 or 2 3mg pouches a day with a clear path to 0 nic at all, it’ll all be worth it. At the moment my mentality is that of Fleetwood Mac in that I’m “Never Going Back Again” :) just thought id share… godspeed to all on their journey of quitting",1,1734552623.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False

1hhahat,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hhahat/i_m18_broke_up_with_my_now_ex_f18_and_i_think_i/,I (M18) broke up with my now ex (F18) and I think I regret it? ,"I apologize for the legnth of this post, and thank you to everyone who is willing to take the time to read and respond. That means the world.

Bit of back story. My now ex and I have known each other since middle school, nearly seven years. I’ve always had feelings for her and she felt the same way about me. We never worked out in high school since we both went to different schools and long distance never worked out with us at a young age. We were always on and off until we just broke contact for like a year a half. 3 months before we both graduated high school I contacted her and told her I still had feelings and she felt the same way. From the beginning of April to the beginning of October we had an incredible relationship. Both each other’s first kisses, we both became intimate with each other for the first time ever with anyone. We truly loved each other and it was such a cute young relationship. We were both in dumb young love and I truly believed we were gonna get married 

Only issue was, she’s a huge avoidant. Doesn’t like to show emotions over text, the phone, etc.  Her parents never knew about me so we didn’t see each other that often but when we did she was super physical and I can tell she loved me by the way she treated me in person. When we weren’t in person, she was always super dry, I always had to initiate being lovey and mushy, and I always felt like I had to beg her to show some emotion. I always felt neglected and felt more in love than she did. I was fine with this because I understand she might not be used to showing emotion but to what extent? I expressed this to her a few times and she would always tell me she would change..and never did. 

Fast forward to late September and she started to have a lot of issues in the house. Her parents were constantly arguing and were on the verge of divorce, she tacked on an ample amount of work for college, and she was just stressed all the time. I know this was effecting her a lot and she started to not text me often, wouldn’t update me on anything, and she just lacked effort. The last two months of our relationship we didn’t see each other once. We used to FaceTime at least twice a week but now I hadn’t heard her voice for maybe a month. She never put in any effort all she would do is give me a cute goodmorning message when she woke up  or got to college and never text me again until like midnight when she’ll tell me she finished all her college work. Every time we would make plans she would always cancel. It was always something new. She would rarely even apologize. It was just the norm. I just gave up and stopped making plans and waited on her to initiate something..and she never did. 

I understand she was super stressed and had a lot on her mind, but I didn’t feel prioritized anymore. I always told her I was available to talk if she ever needed it and she never did. She always kept to herself. I knew everything was effecting her and I wanted to help as much as I could but I didn’t know how. She never gave me the green light for anything. This was so egregious where I didn’t even know what my role in her life was anymore. I would always question if I were even valuable to her, if I even made a difference. If me just merely staying there helped her in anyway? She just became super unavailable, unreliable, inconsistent, frustrating and difficult to love. 

I felt incredibly disrespected because she never apologized, never explained the lack of availability, and was never there for me. Not to mention I felt like I was practically begging her to hang out anytime I would ask. If she was bothered by everything at home..tell me. She left me in the dark completely, always expecting something to change and it never did. She never told me just wait on her, be patient with her, About a month before I broke up with her I told her we had to speak in person. She gave me a time, place, and date..and she canceled last minute. A week later? Canceled last minute. We eventually called for the first time in a month and a half I explained myself to her. She apologized and told me she would change but to be honest, I already mentally broke up with her, but I gave her another chance. A week later I told her let’s grab coffee (with the intention of finally breaking up) and she canceled AGAIN. Enough was enough and I broke up with her over text. I let everything out in a very respectful manner. She reciprocated the same energy and said she understood.  

Breaking up with her was one of the easiest things I’ve ever done. She made it incredibly easy and not heart breaking in the slightest. It’s crazy to think how in love with her I was but now I just feel repulsed. This was my first ever relationship and I feel like I've grown so much and matured tremendouosly. I feel like I now know my worth and what I want and don't want out of a relationship. I also feel my self respect has increased tremdendously as well. She was an amazing girl just sooooo inconsistent. Did she become uninterested? I just don't understand. Despite how busy my life was and or would be (working full time, school full time, hobbies, etc) I would always make time for her regardless of circumstance. I can say with confidence she would've never done that for me at the end of our relationship. Was it really her avoidant personality or something more? If more, why did she stay and leave me in the dark? Was it her problems at home? Why didn't she tell me that if so? Could I had been a better partner or should I had stayed out of sympathy for her? 

Despite how easy it was to break up with her, a part of me misses something. I don't think it's her. I'm no longer attracted to her as a person, and I wouldn't want to get back with her, but I miss being in a relationship, and sometimes I think I won't connect with someone better. We had such a strong bond and so many expereinces I will always appreciate. We built such a strong connection and I'm not sure if I'm ready to let go of the idea of her. She was my best friend and I loved her so many years. Will I truly find someone better or is she just going to be the one that got away in my life? Was this relationship a lesson more than anything? I know I will find someone better but it is tough to accept. 

TLDR: Broke up with my ex of seven to eight months due to her lack of avalibity. I felt great and she made it super easy to break up with her when I did. I'm no longer in love but I sometimes feel I did the wrong thing. ",1,1734552569.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1hhah3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATHELP/comments/1hhah3u/behavioural_help/,behavioural help?,"hi!! sorry I just don't think this is a vet issue (I'll get to why in a minute) and I truly don't know what to do about this.

okay so! I have 4 cats, 3 are adults and 1 is a year old.The issue lies right now with one of the adults, her name is Minerva and since the little one (the 1y/o) got here, she's been peeing on stuff other than their litter boxes. I thought it was territory marking at first (?) because she doesn't like children of all species. But then she got chill with the little one, she doesn't love him, but is chill with him most of the time.

And yet the peeing on stuff persists. Now, my roommate of a few months expressed concern, and suggested a visit to the vet. But the thing is, the cat actively chooses where she pees. Sometimes she goes on one of the litter boxes (we have 2), other times on the floor of the shower or on the mop. But most of the fucking time she goes on the dinner table (we don't eat there, I use it as a work table but it's clumped with my work stuff and she pees on it). 

She has peed on my clothes, my roommate clothes, some plushies, but her top two favorite places are the diner table and the coffee table. 

is there a way to get her to stop? I can't scold her because she does it when we don't see her (I KNOW it's her because she's the only one with history of doing her business outside the litter boxes), and I'm starting to hallucinate the goddamn vinegar smell to get the pee smell out.

They did xrays, digestive exams, ultrasounds and even unfortunately a colonoscopy and everything was fine. The last thing that they suggested was IBS, which makes sense because recently I've started to get cramping and my bowel habits changed which was weird, although I didn't know if ibs could show up out of nowhere (I've never asked). I now deal with so much pain, I get full very quickly when I eat and I'm always bloated, not to mention tired and lightheaded. 

I keep getting ads for Ryze, some coffee brand that uses mushrooms in their coffee which it supposed to help with gut health among other things. I didn't know if anyone had any experience with them and if they noticed that it works. I see people saying it does on their ads, but those are sponsored posts so I tend to not trust those. I see mixed reviews about flavor which I don't care about, I honestly just don't know if those mushrooms will make me sick.

I'm just looking for some sort of cure since I feel like I've tried everything. I just started bentyl last week too but so far all it's done it make my mouth dry and very nauseous lol. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much:)",1,1734552376.0,ibs,0,1.0,False
1hhaeih,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1hhaeih/whats_the_best_way_to_lose_belly_fat_quickly/,What’s the Best Way to Lose Belly Fat Quickly Without Dieting?,"Losing belly fat is a struggle most of us have faced at some point. But what if I told you there are ways to target that stubborn fat without diving into strict diets? Many are now turning to alternative methods, such as supplements like **Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic**, that claim to work alongside your regular lifestyle. Let’s unpack the science, the options, and whether it’s really possible to lose belly fat quickly without dieting.

# The Problem with Belly Fat

Belly fat isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s also linked to health risks like heart disease, diabetes, and inflammation. Reducing it is often about balancing lifestyle factors such as metabolism, gut health, and sleep quality.

However, not everyone wants to or can follow a restrictive diet. That’s where approaches like **Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic** come into play, claiming to help without overhauling your eating habits. If you’re curious, check out more details on this product [**here**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/2B2JG9GF/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST).

# What Are Your Options Without Dieting?

# 1. Boost Your Metabolism

A sluggish metabolism is often the culprit behind stubborn belly fat. Natural metabolism boosters like green tea, coffee, and MCT oil can help, but supplements like **Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic** include ingredients like spirulina and berberine specifically designed to enhance calorie burning, even during rest.

# 2. Improve Gut Health

Poor digestion can lead to bloating and fat storage. Prebiotic-rich foods or supplements like inulin, found in Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic, can support gut health by feeding good bacteria and improving digestion.

# 3. Focus on Sleep Quality

It’s surprising how much sleep impacts fat loss. Poor sleep increases cortisol, a stress hormone linked to belly fat. Supplements that include calming agents like hops (also found in Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic) can help improve sleep and indirectly reduce fat storage.

# 4. Try Tummy Fat Burner Drinks

Drinks like **Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic** are designed to work overnight, helping you burn fat while addressing sleep and digestion issues.

For a more detailed breakdown, explore the product’s mechanism [**here**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/2B2JG9GF/?uid=24430&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST).

# Does It Work?

The short answer: it depends. Many users report visible reductions in belly fat when they pair supplements like Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic with light activity or mindful eating. While it won’t replace a healthy lifestyle, it can complement it by addressing the root causes of fat accumulation.

# Final Thoughts

If you’re looking for a way to lose belly fat without strict dieting, focusing on metabolism, gut health, and sleep could be a game changer. Supplements like **Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic** offer a practical solution for those looking to make progress without sacrificing their favorite foods.",1,1734552370.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False

But the truth is, specialty coffee doesn’t have to be complicated to be enjoyable. You don’t need a $500 setup or a science degree to appreciate a great cup. Sometimes, it’s as simple as learning a few basics—like how to choose the right beans or brew with what you already have.

Ever felt like your office chair was slowly turning into a medieval torture device? Yeah, me too. That's why I embarked on a wild, wobbly adventure to find the perfect ergonomic standing desk. Buckle up, folks, we're in for a ride as we dive into my personal, painfully honest ergonomic standing desk reviews. Let's find out which desk turned my workspace from a wooden nightmare to a standing oasis!
  
  
## The Standing Desk Conundrum: Sitting Is the New Smoking

Sitting is sneaky, isn’t it? One moment, you’re cozy in your chair, sipping coffee, and the next, you realize you’ve been glued to that seat for an eternity. I can still recall the day I had my lightbulb moment—it was a regular Tuesday, and I felt like a slug after an 8-hour workday. Then, I stumbled upon an article that labeled sitting as “the new smoking.” Wait, what? My mind sprinted back to images of my grandmother, her constant warnings about not sitting too long because “it’ll kill me.” Who knew she was such a prophet?

Research shows that extended sitting can lead to all sorts of health issues—heart disease, diabetes, you name it. A study published in the Journal of Physical Activity & Health revealed that people who sit for more than eight hours a day have a 20%-30% increased risk of dying prematurely. Yikes! That’s a sobering thought, and I’d much rather not join the ranks of early leavers.

As I digested this info, the allure of standing desks beckoned me. Could standing while I work really help flip the script? Health experts claim that using a standing desk can improve posture, boost energy, and even ramp up productivity like nobody’s business. I was ready to dive into this quest—less slouch, more stand! 

## The Great Desk Search: Where to Begin?

Embarking on my quest for the perfect standing desk felt a lot like browsing a device shop without my glasses—everything looked a bit fuzzy, and I was completely overwhelmed. There are so many choices! I jumped into research, scouring online reviews, articles, and videos until my eyes practically bled. Let me tell you, the standing desk world is like a wild jungle of options, and I was the confused explorer, lost among vines of reviews and opinions.

Read more: <https://tedsadvice.com/ergonomic-standing-desk-reviews> 

First up were the types of desks: fixed, electric, and manual. Fixed desks are just what they sound like—solid and non-adjustable. They remind me of that determined friend who refuses to change their mind, no matter how compelling the argument. Pros? They are sturdy and often cheaper. Cons? They’re about as flexible as a rock.

Then, there's the electric standing desk. Ah, the beauty of pressing a button and watching it rise like a phoenix! The pro here is ease and instant gratification—who doesn’t love that? But hold your horses; the con is they require a power source, and if your power goes out, so does your desk height.

Finally, we have manual standing desks, which are like cranky old machines at a carnival. They are adjustable and usually less expensive, but cranking them up like you're trying to win a stuffed bear can be exhausting. Imagine my face when I realized I had to do that several times a day! I found myself in a hilarious struggle one day, trying to shuffle around my office like a contortionist while adjusting the desk—honestly, my cat was judging me. 

Through this chaotic adventure, I realized that finding the right standing desk is more than just a purchase; it’s a hilarious journey of trial and error, with every angle of research providing another silly story to tell.

## The Desk That Wouldn't Budge: Manual Standing Desk Showdown

Manual standing desks can be a real workout—if you’re not careful, you might develop biceps worthy of a superhero just from the height adjustment! Picture this: you’ve settled in for a productive afternoon, only to realize your desk is lower than a limbo stick at a toddler’s birthday party. You’ve got two choices: bend like a pretzel or whip out the cranks like you’re trying to start an old tractor. Talk about an upper body challenge!

So, after a brief wrestling match with the crank (I swear it had a mind of its own!), I achieved a height that I thought was perfect. But alas, about 15 minutes into my typing escapades, I noticed I was leaning forward like a cat stalking a stray bug. Perfectly ridiculous and totally counterproductive! 

The pros of manual standing desks? They’re often more affordable and straightforward—no fancy tech to break down, just good ol’ human muscle. But the cons…oh boy! Lack of an electric motor means every height adjustment feels like scaling Mount Everest. Also, I must say, they can be as stubborn as a mule. That stubborn crank often leaves you questioning your life choices while you’re tugging and pulling, silently cursing ergonomic innovation!

## The Electric Slide: Plugging In, Standing Up

Navigating the world of electric standing desks feels a bit like entering a sci-fi device shop. You’ve got cords and buttons everywhere, making you wonder if the desk is smarter than you, or perhaps it’s just waiting to take over the world one height adjustment at a time. When I finally plugged mine in, it was as if I’d summoned a futuristic friend. The buttons beeped cheerfully while the desk transitioned from sitting to standing like it was doing a little dance. 

Standing up and down became a power trip—literally! I felt like I was on some secret mission: “Activate Standing Mode!” Who knew I could feel that dramatic just from adjusting a desk? But, alas, not all was rosy in my electric Eden. The cords! Oh, the cords. They had a sneaky habit of tangling around my feet like stubborn vines. More than once, I almost tripped over the power cord while trying to impress my cat with my newfound agility. Spoiler alert: it was not impressed. 

And let’s not even get started on those moments when the desk unexpectedly shoots up mid-email. You’re typing away, deep in thought, and suddenly, you’re doing a stand-up comedy routine—just trying to keep your coffee from spilling! As much as I love the convenience of a button-operated desk, you have to keep your wits about you. But hey, who doesn’t love a little thrill during their workday?

## The Workspace Alchemy: How to Make Your Desk Work for You

Ergonomics isn’t just a fancy word used by office supply salespeople; it’s a game changer for how we work, especially when standing at a desk. I remember the day I proudly set up my standing desk. I felt like a champion! But, oh boy, was I in for a learning curve. Your goal should be to create a setup that makes you feel like you’re ready to take on the world, not like you’re stuck in a medieval torture device.

First things first, monitor height is critical. I learned the hard way that if your screen is too low, you’ll end up tilting your head like a confused puppy. Yikes! My monitor is now eye-level, which keeps my neck from feeling like it went ten rounds with a boxing champ. And guess what? My keyboard? It’s just below my elbows. I’ve seen folks place theirs way too low, making them look like they’re trying to play a piano while standing on tiptoes.

Ergonomic accessories can turn your workspace from blah to brilliant. I added a soft mat to stand on, which feels like hugging a cloud. Trust me; your feet will thank you! A wrist rest for the keyboard has also been a total lifesaver. Pro tip: Stay aware of your posture. Keep your back straight, shoulders relaxed—less like a slouchy potato and more like a confident superhero! What’s your setup like? Are you standing tall or stuck in a work slump?

## The Grand Finale: My Top Picks for the Best Ergonomic Standing Desks

After countless hours of research, trial and error, and maybe one too many cups of coffee, I’ve finally settled on my top three ergonomic standing desks. I mean, who knew that finding a desk could turn into a full-blown adventure, right? Each desk offers unique features, pros, and cons that cater to different users. Let me break it down.

First up, we’ve got the desk that’s perfect for those who love a bit of flexibility. This beauty effortlessly transitions from sitting to standing at the push of a button. Seriously, it’s like having a mini workout session every time you adjust it! It’s sturdy, spacious, and has enough room for a laptop, maybe a snack, and perhaps a plant (because, you know, plants are life). However, it's a tad heavy, so if you're planning an impromptu office move, you might want to enlist a friend—or two.

Next is a sleek model that’s incredibly stylish. It looks good in any office setup, and let’s be honest, looking cool while working is half the battle. It's super easy to assemble. That’s a huge plus! But, a few users have noted that the height range could be a bit limited for taller folks. 

Last but not least, there’s the desk that goes above and beyond with customization. Need a built-in charging station? Check! Want a spot for your morning coffee? Double-check! This desk is like the Swiss Army knife of desks. But, be aware: with all these features, it does come with a higher price tag. So, if you’re on a budget, you might have to save those pennies for a while. 

No matter what your needs are, these desks have something to offer. Now, let’s get you standing taller and working happier!

## Conclusions
  
  
So, there you have it, folks! My wild, wobbly journey through the world of ergonomic standing desks. I hope my personal experiences and expert insights have steered you towards the perfect standing desk for you. Remember, standing up to your desk is the first step in standing up for your health. Now, go forth, stand tall, and work happy!",1,1734552118.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False

Download the Costa Coffee app and enter a referral code to get a **free** sweat treat of your choice. You **need to opt into receive marketing comms** to get the free cake voucher emailed to you.

New customers will **also receive 5 free “beans”** (Costa Loyalty scheme) following your first purchase. This is in addition to the 1 point awarded for downloading the app. You collect 1 bean for every purchased drink (2 beans if you bring a reusable cup). Once you have accumulated 10 beans you can claim a free drink.

———————————-

Steps:

* **Download the Costa app**. Direct from your App Store or find a link ([here](https://www.costa.co.uk/costa-club#app-promo)).
* **Register** and enter the referral code **C9HgF**
* Remember to opt into comms to receive the free cake email on your birthday!
* To receive the “free” 5 beans first **make a purchase at Costa and scan the app when paying**.
* The 5 free beans will be **credited to your account within 48 hours** (it was immediately for me).

Pro tip, if it’s anything like Caffè Nero then you only get 1 free bean per drinks order maximum (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 beans (or 4 if using reusable cups).

Enjoy the free cake I recommend the Mini Cherry Bakewell!

We would really love to put a sectional ( thinking a sofa with a bumper chaise and an ottoman), coffee table, nice rug and maybe one accent chair in the space.

The pics are all with staged furniture and we are not attached to any furniture so full blank slate here. Any suggestions/insight would be greatly appreciated! :)

DC commentary:
>! Our studio is going into the holiday schedule from tomorrow so there was a lot of pressure being placed on the coach today to open up the 4:55am class tomorrow (we are dropping the early morning class and the evening classes). Offers of a coffee and wake up calls to try and convince her to come in :) Anyway back to today - we have an ESP today which means you get a bit of everything. Endurance, strength and power blocks on the treadmill and floor. A few rows but nothing too difficult here. \
\
With the treads they all follow a very similar format - you break them into smaller 3 x 2 minutes of effort and recovery with a 45 second all out to finish. Each two minute effort is broken into a push like effort and a recovery. For the endurance block this means you start with a 90 second push into a 30 second base, then this decreases over the next two parts before you finish with the all out. On the strength block you are at base the entire time but the pushes are replaced with bases at incline. On the power block you get build blocks into 30 second all outs before finishing again with that 45 second all out. \
\
I didn’t think this was too bad. Your longer efforts are still only 90 seconds which is very doable given everything else we have been doing lately. Good distance of 5.51km (3.424 miles) in the tread blocks this morning. Lots of recovery, especially in the power block. \
\
Two blocks on the floor. Your ESP workout is all in the first, longer block. You have the same four exercises - split squats, sumo deadlifts, high rows and a hollow hold chest press. The thing that changes for each part is the number of reps and the length of the row that you do at the end of each part. 16 reps for endurance, 8 for strength and 4 at an explosive tempo for power. The idea is that you will change your weight selection for each part to suit the focus. Once you have finished all parts you get to repeat your favourite (mine was strength). You should have enough time to get through all parts and maybe some of the bonus. \
\
Last block is a core blast. It is a little different as I haven’t seen the TRX being used in the core work that much in the past. Essentially you are incorporating the TRX as part of the core work. Hold the TRX up above you for the sit up with your legs facing away from the wall - the idea being that you keep tension in the TRX by pushing out against the band as you do the sit up and then the same for the straight leg raise. It kind of felt like the straight arm sit up when doing it and you probably have to focus a bit more on keeping the tension on the band as you are doing the sit up. Your finisher today is pretty lame - just increase your intensity for 45 seconds as you go through the core exercises. \
\
I didn’t think today was too difficult. Only managed 8 splats so pretty average I guess. I would give today a 3 (🪶 🪶 🪶) out of 5 for gentleness. !<

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you’re searching for a simple and effective way to enhance your smile, you may want to consider sheer white teeth whitening strips. These strips are designed to brighten your teeth at home, helping you achieve a radiant smile with minimal effort. Here are some of the key benefits to keep in mind.

### Easy Application

One of the biggest advantages of sheer white teeth whitening strips is their convenience. Unlike professional treatments that may require appointments or complex procedures, these strips allow you to whiten your teeth in the comfort of your home. Simply peel the strip from its backing, apply it directly to your teeth, and let it work its magic. Most strips can be worn for 30 minutes to an hour, making it easy to fit into your daily routine.

### Targeted Whitening

Sheer white teeth whitening strips are specifically designed to conform to your teeth. This allows them to target the stained areas effectively, ensuring an even application of the whitening agent. Their flexibility means they can adhere well to your teeth, providing contact where it is needed most for optimal results.

### Fast Results

If you’re eager to see results, these whitening strips can deliver noticeable improvements in as little as a few days. Many users report seeing a brighter smile within the first week of use. The gradual process helps prevent sensitivity issues that can arise from more aggressive whitening methods, allowing you to enjoy a brighter smile without discomfort.

### Cost-Effective Option

Compared to in-office whitening treatments, sheer white teeth whitening strips are much more budget-friendly. You can easily find these strips at local pharmacies or online, often without a prescription. For a fraction of the price of professional treatments, you can achieve a similar level of whitening effectiveness at home.

### Safe and Effective Ingredients

Most sheer white teeth whitening strips contain safe, effective ingredients. These strips typically use hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide as their active whitening agents, both of which are commonly found in dental products. When used as directed, these strips can effectively remove stains caused by coffee, tea, wine, or tobacco, ultimately leading to a whiter smile.

### Minimal Sensitivity

Many people worry about tooth sensitivity when it comes to whitening treatments. However, sheer white teeth whitening strips are designed with a balanced formula to minimize this issue. Users often experience less sensitivity compared to other whitening methods, such as bleaching trays or professional treatments. This allows you to achieve a brighter smile without the side effects often associated with teeth whitening.

Comparing Sheer White Teeth Whitening Strips with Other Whitening Methods
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to achieving a bright and radiant smile, you may find yourself comparing various teeth whitening methods. One popular option is sheer white teeth whitening strips. These strips have gained popularity for their convenience and effectiveness, making them a preferred choice among many. However, it's essential to explore how they stack up against other whitening methods, such as professional treatments, whitening toothpaste, and natural remedies.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Sheer White Teeth Whitening Strips

Sheer white teeth whitening strips are thin, flexible strips coated with a whitening gel containing active ingredients like hydrogen peroxide. The application is straightforward; you apply them to your teeth, leave them on for a specified duration, and then remove them. Within a few applications, many users notice a significant improvement in the brightness of their smiles.

#### Advantages of Using Whitening Strips

- **Convenience:** The strips are easy to use at home, saving you trips to the dentist.
- **Affordable:** Compared to professional whitening services, strips are usually within a budget-friendly price range.
- **Discreet:** They are thin and can be worn under your lips, making them a low-key option for whitening your teeth.
- **Quick Results:** Many users report visible results within just a few treatments.

### Professional Teeth Whitening

Professional teeth whitening is another option people often consider. Dentists offer treatments that can include in-office whitening, custom take-home trays, or even laser whitening.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
#### Pros and Cons

### Whitening Toothpaste

Whitening toothpaste is another popular choice, often marketed as a quick and easy option to brighten your smile.

#### How It Works

These toothpastes usually contain mild abrasives and special chemicals that help remove stains. While they can help maintain a bright smile, they may not yield the same level of results as sheer white teeth whitening strips or professional treatments.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages:**
    - Easy to integrate into your daily oral care routine.
    - Generally less expensive than whitening strips and other treatments.
    - Help in preventing new stains from forming.
- **Disadvantages:**

    - Does not target deeper stains effectively.

### Natural Remedies

Thanks to the rise of wellness trends, some individuals have turned to natural remedies for teeth whitening, such as baking soda, activated charcoal, or even fruit peels.

#### Considerations

While these methods can be gentler on the wallet and potentially more natural, their effectiveness varies significantly. Some methods may even harm your enamel over time.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
#### Pros and Cons

- **Pros:**
    - Inexpensive and easily available ingredients.
    - May appeal to those looking for natural solutions.
- **Cons:**
    - Limited evidence supporting their effectiveness.
    - Potential risks of harming teeth or leading to uneven results.

When comparing sheer white teeth whitening strips to other whitening methods, think about your specific needs and goals. If you're looking for convenience, affordability, and visible results in a shorter timeframe, sheer white teeth whitening strips may be the best choice for you. However, if you’re comfortable visiting a dentist and want a more intense treatment, professional whitening might be worth considering. Keep in mind that every option has its pros and cons, so weigh these factors against your unique situation to make the best choice for a brighter smile.

### Conclusion

A brighter smile not only enhances your appearance but also boosts your confidence. Sheer white teeth whitening strips are a popular choice for many seeking an effective and convenient solution. They offer significant benefits, including ease of use, comfort, and impressive results. With these strips, you can achieve a whiter smile at home without the need for costly dental visits or complicated procedures.

When comparing sheer white teeth whitening strips to other whitening methods, such as professional treatments or DIY natural remedies, you'll find that they strike a perfect balance between efficacy and convenience. Professional whitening can deliver rapid results, but it usually comes with a hefty price tag and requires time away from your schedule. On the other hand, home remedies may be appealing, but they often lack the scientific backing and reliability that sheer white strips provide.

Using sheer white teeth whitening strips allows you to maintain flexibility in your routine. You can wear them while watching a movie, working, or even cooking dinner, making it easy to incorporate into your daily life.

Ultimately, if you're looking to brighten your teeth conveniently and effectively, you might find sheer white teeth whitening strips to be the ideal solution for your needs.

1hha2wd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hha2wd,Year End Lookback,"Looking back at this year was fun. I have gotten to experience over 80 different coffees since January. These are some of the more notable ones that i have had this year. I have had a couple more that I am working on, but I am not counting anything that I started drinking in December of this year for the list.
I have tried most of them as a pourover, espresso, flatwhite/latte, and some kind of immersion. These ones pictured were able to stand out in one way. The DAK Gimlet was one of my all time favorites, and I am now on the hunt for a new coffee that will give me the limey flavor that I got to experience with this one.
Looking forward to next year I am excited to try new beans from new roasters, and see if some old reliable roasters produce anything fun. I think I am going to try to get some Tim Windelboe, April, or Nomad to start the year with. ",0,1734551553.0,pourover,0,0.5,False

But I wanted to reach back out to get some input. So I stopped Abilify cold turkey back in early August after taking it for 7 months. I am feeling a lot better than I was..but I still am experiencing a few withdrawal symptoms I think. Every day I wake up with this internal shakiness. So I have to take a Propranolol. After about 6-7 hours it wears off and the shakiness comes back! I try to just power through though instead of taking another Propranolol. Has anyone else experienced the shakiness? I have never had this until I cold turkeyed Abilify. I don’t want to have to rely on Propranolol for the rest of my life if I can help it. I also have realized that I am very sensitive to absolutely EVERYTHING now. I can’t metabolize things like I used to if that makes sense? Allergy medicine makes me feel like I’m losing my mind now.

I’m participating in a Secret Santa, and my recipient is a 30-year-old guy who runs marathons and is also a doctor. I’d love to get him something thoughtful and useful, but the budget is under $60. Since this subreddit has such amazing taste, I thought you all might have some creative suggestions! 😊

Some ideas I’ve considered so far:

* Skincare products for post-run recovery or to combat long hospital shifts.
* A nice water bottle or portable coffee thermos.
* Maybe something Korean beauty-inspired, like cooling patches, sheet masks, or foot masks (if they’re marathon-friendly).

# From April 2025, Dutch coffee shops will only be permitted to sell regulated cannabis products, as the next phase of the country’s adult-use pilot gets underway.

One year on from the[ launch of the Netherlands’ Closed Coffee Shop Chain Experiment,](https://cannabishealthnews.co.uk/2023/09/19/the-netherlands-cannabis-legalisation-pilot-to-launch-december/) regulators have set a fixed date for the transition to what is referred to as its ‘experimental phase’.

On 10 December 2024, Minister Van Weel (J&V) and State Secretary Karremans (VWS), informed the House of Representatives that from 7 April 2025, coffee shops in the 10 municipalities participating in the pilot will only be allowed to sell regulated cannabis products.

The experiment launched on 15 December 2023, with the sale of regulated cannabis products permitted in coffee shops in Tilburg and Breda. 

In June 2024 it was expanded to the regions of Groningen, Zaanstad, Almere, Arnhem, Nijmegen, Voorne aan Zee, Heerlen, and Maastricht, with coffee shops in all participating municipalities now allowed to sell regulated products, in addition to tolerated products.

After almost a year of regulated supply, 70 of the 75 participating coffee shops are now said to have adopted a regulated supply.

# Tackling the ‘backdoor policy’

The Netherlands is renowned for its [cannabis coffee shops,](https://cannabishealthnews.co.uk/2021/05/07/dutch-cannabis-experiment-could-see-more-patients-turning-to-coffeeshops/) but previously the sale and cultivation of cannabis for recreational purposes was illegal outside of these establishments. Suppliers were prohibited from selling any cannabis to the businesses, creating what was known as a ‘backdoor policy’.

The Closed Coffee Shop Chain Experiment aims to evaluate the possibility of implementing a regulated chain of production, distribution and sale of cannabis in the Netherlands. 

A team of researchers, under the supervision of an independent Guidance and Evaluation Committee, will also investigate the effects of this on public health, crime, safety and nuisance. 

The results of this research will help inform future decisions on cannabis policy in the Netherlands.

# A ‘definitive date’ for the next phase 

The transition phase was initially due to end in September 2024, but the timeline was extended due to insufficient production from growers, according to [local media](https://nltimes.nl/2024/12/10/regulated-cannabis-supply-chain-experiment-enter-new-phase-april-2025) reports. Coffee shop owners are said to have criticized the limited supply and variety, citing quality concerns.

Regulators say the new date is final to ensure a “clear perspective for municipalities, coffee shop owners and growers”.

**The deadline also coincides with the addition of three more growers to the experiment, bringing the total number of licensed suppliers to seven.**

**“With a definitive date in sight, growers will have clarity about when they can start producing in full. This way, the supply of regulated weed and hash can be further tailored to the demand of coffee shop owners,” ministers Van Weel and Karremans said.**

**“In addition, the 5th, 6th and 7th growers are also expected to be ready to deliver in April. This will benefit both the choice of coffee shops and the stability of the supply.”**

**The experimental phase is expected to last four years.**

Drank some Huel Black vanilla for breakfast, and I finally feel like myself. I don't know what's in it that does this; I've taken expensive multivitamins and supplements before, and eaten protein and vegetables. Maybe it's the quantity of protein and the fact it's plant-based so my body can absorb it. Whatever it is, I'm very grateful.

This happens to me a lot. I get lethargic and weak, and then I remember I have Huel Black and feel better. It tastes good, but I get bored of it if I use it every day. Guess I should just power through and drink it from breakfast every day even if it isn't satisfying me.

Thank you to the Huel team for making this product available and easily accessible.

My boyfriend and I decided to get our first machine this month, and we decided on the Gaggia Classic Pro.

I don't know a lot about the specifications but my boyfriend did most of the research and got all of the accessories for the machine. We are having problems with a really slow extraction time. Like 2.5oz in 3 minutes. I work at a cafe as a barista so I know a fair amount, and we are not super beginners in coffee, but it seems everything we have tried won't produce a quicker extraction time so we are beginning to wonder if the machine is defective.

We are using the fellow opus grinder, and we have tried grind sizes between 1.5-3.5. We tried the original portafilters that came with the machine using the recommended ""2 scoops"" which actually produced the best result, but currently we are trying to use a bottomless portafilter from Whole Latte Love, a 20g basket. We have tried between 16-19 grams in the basket and all the results are the same. We're using a normcore spring loaded tamper.

If anyone has any ideas, even something really obvious maybe we just missed. Please let me know, we would rather not have to return the machine.",2,1734550698.0,gaggiaclassic,3,1.0,False

In a text she wrote, “At this point i’m frustrated with everyone. last night all i wanted was to play the piano. i haven’t gotten to play since july and it’s something that really means a lot to me. i understand it’s not mine, its not my house and other people live there. all i wanted was an hour and a half to myself. i like to sit and pla y and be vulnerable for a bit and it’s hard to do that when somebody is staring. then (my husband) angerly walks off, embarrassing me. then later when son(22) was leaving he asked me to move my car and when i asked if he was gonna block me in the next morning the response was “i have a fucking life too.” it hurts my feelings. I left around midnight and nobody seemed to notice i was gone until almost 1 today. i’m not happy being there. i love you but it’s so toxic there and it makes me immensely depressed so fast. it’s clear that everyone hates each other. i’m depressed and anxious about our family and future and it makes everyday hard for me. i don’t want to come home anymore. this has become too much for me to bare.”  
I responded, “I noticed at 9 am. But I didn’t say anything until noon because I honestly didn’t think you would leave without saying goodbye. I thought you might have went out for coffee or something. I’m sorry you are so miserable.”  
I then proceeded to text her upbeat messages daily for the week. My daughter then called her half sis (female 29) that I TOLD HER NOT TO COME HOME FOR CHRISTMAS!. And that I haven’t spoke to her all week. I spoke to her DAILY and all I got was one-word answers. And I never said don’t come for Christmas. I used her words and asked her, “since you feel this is a toxic environment, do you plan on coming home for Christmas? My kid (F21) said there is one thing that you said to me when I was in 9th grade that I’ll never forget. You told me that when I am upset, I effecteverybody’s mood around me. (What I (op) actually said was “when you panic you make everybody around you anxious too.” She has never forgot that. She says we have done the same thing. Because you (Me OP) are upset, you have driven everybody else away, including me. (FYI, I went and lied down in my bedroom with the door closed.) Daughter 21 then said Of course I want to be home for Christmas,  But if this is how I am going to be treated then I will. You say I am welcome, but that is not apparent. I have never felt less welcome in my life. You know I love you, and I know you’re going to be mad that I’m not coming home.

She'll be moving out of her home next month and into a little condo of her own. It's a 55-plus community. She's lived alone for 10 years since my dad passed, and it's been 34 years since they first bought the house, so this is a huge change.

I'm thinking of a Home Depot/Lowe's gift card, and also getting her gift a basket of essentials she'll need in her first week, like flashlights, cleaning supplies, a new shower curtain & liner, and coffee. 

She does *not* drink alcohol and she doesn't cook anymore, except to warm things up. She's all set on plates, kitchen gadgets and tools because my dad had a ton.

Am I missing something that would be useful for an older woman to have around the house? What about services?  I don't think she'd want a cleaning service (she's insanely practical and private) but any other intangibles that may be useful?

After having toto toilets I will never have another brand of toilet, but Their bidets are horribly hunch back designed (and look uncomfy) or the slightly higher end models which are less hunchy require like 1500 watts.. which is  INSANE imo. I just want a slightly warm stream, not keurig hot coffee. - Not to mention expensiiiiive.

The problem I am having is there are no outlets in my bathrooms. I'm considering having an electrician tap into the lines on the other side of the wall but those are in bedrooms. So they'd be splitting duty which means if my bidet is drawing massive amps the breaker will flip constantly either from tv's/video games or 3d printers/computers sharing with the  bidet...

Does no one make a decent quality bidet that self cleans well and has warm water (air dry would be cool too) but doesn't draw such massive amps constantly?

Heck I'd be fine with one that only 'occasionally' warms the water.. or even just room temp (i.e. a little warmer than the pipes, say 80F).. if it meant lower power draw.",2,1734550429.0,bidets,1,1.0,False

I’m not really into social media but I need help with what to do about Christmas and my mom giving me the cold shoulder.

Background: My mom has severe and untreated anxiety from an abusive childhood. She has done a lot of work on herself to not repeat the violence she grew up with on her family. You would never know that she was a victim of childhood abuse other than her super clean house, and constant need to be doing something. She has two kids, me and my half sibling (30M). She has been married and divorced three times. I wouldn't say we have a super close relationship with each other plus we live far away from each other. Except we make a big effort for holidays and birthdays (all birthdays coincide with a major US holiday so it became a thing). I really enjoy these times together.

The Situation: I’ve been busy. Last year I got married. We bought a house and just finished a 5 month reno project. Then in August we adopted a puppy. Plus, my husband (37M) and I both have high paying and demanding careers. Some days are super stressful but I love my life.

Normally, I call my mom once a week to check in on her. But since September it’s been more like twice a month. And we skipped Thanksgiving this year due to my work and my birthday landed on the day of so I wasn’t in the mood to cook and host a big event. Plus, no one else volunteered to host.

Last week, she texts me at 7AM asking to talk. I told her I was walking the pup but would give her call when I was back home with coffee. At 8AM I call. She clearly has been crying. She immediately launches into it.

Mom: “I feel like something has changed. We are not as close. Do I need to apologize for something?” 

Me, “Mom, there is nothing wrong. I’ve been super busy and stressed but looking forward to our time together this Christmas.”

Mom: “When we do talk, it doesn’t feel the same. I know you’re busy but it feels bigger than just you being busy.”

Okay, this is where I wasn’t the kindest and snapped.

Me: “Mom, I need you to be okay without me checking in on you all the time. I’m just busy right now.”

Mom: “Wow. I need to put a pin in this.” Hangs up. 

We haven’t talked since. Originally, she was supposed to come down Christmas Eve and stay with us through Thursday. Last night I received all of our Christmas presents from her in the mail. Today she texted about her dog being hurt and can’t stay over so she is only visiting Christmas day and leaving by 4pm. Now my brother doesn't want to come if it's just him. He has a seasonal job so time off in the winter is a big deal especially to his paycheck. 

My emotional reaction is to tell everyone to stay home. I also believe if you ask to pause a conversation then it’s your responsibility to bring it up again when you’re ready to talk. I also don’t understand where this “everything is different now” is coming from. My husband says it will sort itself out and not to fret. So Reddit strangers, what’s your read on the situation? 

TL;DR My mom has been giving me the cold shoulder after a bad phone call and now Christmas family plans are up in the air and everyone is being awkward.

>[20-100](https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftIdeas/?f=flair_name%3A%2220-100%22)

>She loves talking about her kids and tries to upkeep a polished, professional appearance. She’s really into movies and food—used to be a food scientist, actually. On the surface, she’s polite and kind, but underneath, she’s got some seriously rough edges. She’ll chat about fancy things but tends to be pretty frugal in her everyday life. Every once in awhile star wars collectibles of hers will briefly come up in conversation, but she'll quickly change the subject out of embarrassment.

>I'm not even remotely sure what to get her. I know her inside and out when it comes to her emotions, but I don't know her nearly as well when it comes to ""material"" likes.

It sounds like your best friend is a wonderfully dynamic person with a mix of professional polish and some playful quirks! Based on her love for her kids, her professional demeanor, her background in food science, and the occasional *Star Wars* mentions, I’ve come up with some thoughtful gift ideas that will reflect both her sophistication and those rougher edges she sometimes hides.

# Gift Ideas (in the $20-$100 Range):

# 1. Professional yet Fun: Star Wars-Themed Jewelry (Subtle, Not Over the Top)

* **Why it’s a great idea:** Since she has a secret love for *Star Wars* but tends to brush it off, a subtle piece of jewelry that’s Star Wars-themed but elegant enough for her professional wardrobe could be perfect. A minimalist necklace or bracelet featuring a small, understated charm, like the Millennium Falcon or a Rebel Alliance symbol, might strike the right balance.
* **Where to get it:** Look for elegant pieces from Etsy or **Amazon** that offer more refined, understated Star Wars designs.

# 2. A Food Science Book or Culinary Experiment Kit

* **Why it’s a great idea:** Given her background in food science, she may appreciate a thoughtful book that taps into her passion for food. Look for books that explore food from a scientific perspective or ones focused on modern food culture. You could also consider a **culinary experiment kit**—something she can use at home to indulge in her love of food science without it being too much of a time investment.
* **Where to get it:**
   * **“The Food Lab” by J. Kenji López-Alt** is a great option for a book.
   * [Culinary Science Kits on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=culinary+science+kit&tag=gifts-favspro-20)

# 3. Smart Reusable Coffee Cup or Travel Mug

* **Why it’s a great idea:** As a professional, she probably has a busy routine, and a high-quality **smart reusable coffee cup** could be both stylish and practical. Look for insulated, leak-proof cups or travel mugs with a polished design to keep her beverage at the perfect temperature. This type of gift combines function and style, something she would likely use every day while on the go.
* **Where to get it:** Consider **Contigo**, **Hydro Flask**, or **S’well** for a sleek, professional look. [Contigo Travel Mug](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Contigo+travel+mug&tag=gifts-favspro-20)

# 4. A Professional Lunchbox or Meal Prep Set

* **Why it’s a great idea:** Given her professional nature and love for food, a **stylish, high-quality lunchbox** or **meal prep kit** would fit perfectly into her daily life. These sets often come with multiple compartments and come in sleek designs—perfect for someone who wants to bring homemade meals to work or who just needs a convenient way to organize snacks and meals.

# 5. Premium Skincare or Self-Care Kit

* **Why it’s a great idea:** Since she’s a professional who likes to keep a polished appearance, a **high-quality skincare kit** could be a nice gift.

It’s a small indulgence she can enjoy, especially if she doesn’t splurge on herself often.

# 6. A Stylish, Minimalist Diaper Bag (or Diaper Bag Accessories)

* **Why it’s a great idea:** As a mother of two young children, she might appreciate something **stylish yet functional**, like a sleek, minimalist **diaper bag** that doesn’t scream “baby gear.” Alternatively, a thoughtful set of **diaper bag accessories** like a changing mat, organizer inserts, or a bottle holder could be both practical and personal.
* **Where to get it:** Look for high-quality, stylish options from **Skip Hop**, **JuJuBe**, or **Bag Nation**. [Skip Hop Diaper Bag](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Skip+Hop+diaper+bag&tag=gifts-favspro-20)

# 7. Custom Name or Initials Wine Glasses or Whiskey Tumblers

Look for planners that also offer a section for goal-setting or self-care, something that might help her balance both her personal and professional life.
* **Where to get it:** Consider **Moleskine**, **Erin Condren**, or [**Ban.do**](http://Ban.do) for professional yet fun options. [Moleskine Planner](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Moleskine+planner&tag=gifts-favspro-20)

# 10. A Movie Night Gift Set (For a Little Escape)

* **Why it’s a great idea:** If she loves movies, a **movie night gift set** could be the perfect way for her to unwind. Put together a small basket with some **gourmet popcorn**, a couple of classic movies, and a cozy throw blanket. Add a personalized touch with her favorite snacks or drinks. It’s a practical gift that also allows her to relax after a busy week.

It's great that you’re looking for something practical and thoughtful that could make a meaningful difference in your parents' everyday lives! Given your mom’s gracefulness and the fact that she seems to appreciate functional yet elevated items, here are some ideas that could be a perfect fit for their home and routine:

1hh9cai,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hh9cai/aita_for_crossing_my_best_friends_boundaries/,AITA for crossing my best friends boundaries while struggling with a break up,"

So this year, February 2024, | (F19) broke up with my ex girlfriend (F19). We’ll call her Andrea. We had been together for 2 and half years and we started dating as juniors in high school. Our relationship was never very rock solid, and there were very few times in our relationship that I felt like things were smooth sailing. Our first year post graduation, I moved three hours away from home for college, and she moved two and a half, but we lived about 4 hours away from each other. Our second year post grad, she decided to go to the tech in our home town and work near full time and live at home, while I stayed 3 hours away in a city for my second year of college. During our relationship after high school, I lived with her and her family (Mom, Dad, Sister) over winter and summer breaks, as my mom moved away from my hometown and I wanted to keep working and stay close to my high school friends.

Our relationship started by Andrea trying to cheat on her then girlfriend, with me. (I curbed this, don’t worry). During our relationship, I always said I didn't mind if she was friends with her exes as long as they were respectful of our relationship, and as long as l had a day or so of notice that they'd be hanging out, just because it always made me a little bit insecure. On 3 or so occasions, she would hang out with her ex or old situationships without telling me ahead of time. There was one instance where we were at a party and she left me halfway through to hang out with a girl she used to have a crush on.

When I went to college, she would often try to embarrass me in front of my new friends by sharing intimate details of our sex life or my body with them, and I always communicated with her in private that I hated it. She always ignored it. Whenever I hung out with my friends, she'd often call me for over 20 minutes and made me feel guilty and uncomfortable hanging up on her. I was decent about communicating when I wouldn’t be on my phone because of spending time with friends, too. She didn't like any of my new friends, and would always joke that they were my girlfriends. She didn't respect any boundaries and would often grab my butt, boobs or crotch in public, she'd pick at my skin even when I asked her to stop (I think I started picking at her pimples without consent too, which wasn't right of me) etc.. She also had a horrible habit of making subtle fat jokes targeted toward me, and laugh along, but it started getting out of hand, and I told her it was starting to put a damper on my body image. She continued to make them till the end of our relationship. She also tried to keep me away from my family, and my mom did not like her at all. She'd purposely make me feel bad every time l left to go hang out with my mom, even after I told her that gives me divorced parents trauma flashbacks (it was always like “you like her more than me” and like “i wish you wouldn’t leave” type of language.).

I wasn't the best in our relationship either. I was so checked out and there was a time that I told her that I wouldn't care if she flirted with other people because I flirted with other people occasionally, too. We'd often get in screaming matches because of how constant her critiquing of my driving was. I probably slipped fat jokes in there to fire back at her jokes to me. I wasn't super friendly with her dogs because I'm not comfortable with dogs barking or loud noises. I also have a very short temper and I get snappy if someone is overtly rude to me pretty quick (because of how Andrea would talk to me, I was always decently quick to yell. This didn't really scare her and it was never my intention to, and she'd yell right back at me).

Anyways, my best friend (F19) was so involved in our friendship that my mom asked if we were a throuple. Let’s call my best friend Kacey. She hung out with us near constantly, especially during our breaks from college. We'd get coffee together, make art together, just be in each others' presence. Andrea would often climb on top of me and try to be lovey with me with Kacey over, and after three months of dating, I felt uncomfortable putting Kacey in that position, but it was also my job to not embarrass and stand by my ex, so I never said anything (you'd think it'd be common sense for my ex not to do that to me). Anyways, Kacey had the closest view of our relationship because of how often we were all together. 

As I previously mention, me and Andrea broke up in February 2024 (the day before Valentines actually). I tried to break up with her 3 times before in our relationship, and I basically said it's not you, it’s me. I said because of how close and involved I was getting at college, I felt like I couldn’t give her the time and effort she deserved, and was in a constant state of feeling guilty over this since college started. I told her it had caused me to grieve our relationship while I was still in it, and it started making communication with her feel like a chore. No one deserves that.

The weekend before I broke up with her, I was partying with my friends at college, and when I was super drunk, I had a fleeting thought pop into my head that I might have a crush on one of my friends there. I brushed it off, because I was in a relationship and my friend (F20) was very straight presenting. Let’s call this friend Lexi.  It also isn’t uncommon to be attracted to other people while you’re in a relationship, but it’s important to keep your commitment to that person. I am close with all of my friends, and love taking care of people I love, and I treated her like everyone else, but the way I take care of my friends might sometimes look like the way you’d treat a partner. 

I let Lexi borrow my jacket and clothes to walk back to her house in the morning when she’d stay over at my house, and a couple of times she slept in my bed with me (we didn’t face each other and never touched each other) because she said my couch messed with her back. Because I didn’t want to make a big problem with Andrea, I wouldn’t tell her when Lexi slept over in my bed unless Andrea asked. It didn’t seem fair to me to be angry at me for sleeping in the same bed because I’ve shared a bed at sleepovers with so many friends throughout my life. It made me feel like I was some weirdo gay freak when she’d restrict my friendships with my new friends, especially because she’d say that they’ll think that I have a crush on them (none of them ever thought I had feelings for them).

The point is, Lexi was not a thought in my head when I broke up with Andrea and that is honest. I was excited to get on dating apps and be single and able to flirt with people pretty soon after we broke up, but the reason I broke up with her was simply because I didn’t feel like we were right for each other anymore.

So the night I break up with Andrea, Lexi came over and we talked the whole night. She told me she thought every time I’d come back to a hangout after talking with my ex on the phone I seemed sad, and she also said that she didn’t think my ex was nice to me (this was the first time I realized that maybe she wasn’t a very nice girlfriend). The next day was Valentine’s day, and all of my friends went out, and me and Lexi went back to my house and we fooled around a little bit, both high and drunk. We did the same thing for a week without talking about it, and I still didn’t think she had a crush on me, or was even gay at this point. I thought she was lowkey just experimenting with me if that.

While all of this is going on, I’m keeping Kacey in the loop. Telling her what’s going on every day, how excited I am to be free and realizing slowly that Andrea wasn’t nice to me. Kacey told me multiple times that she didn’t think Andrea was nice to me in our relationship and after we’d broken up. She also said, “I hope it doesn’t come down to picking sides, but I always have your back first.” Makes sense, we’ve been friends for over 10 years. With all the new stuff with Lexi, Kacey seems excited for me and lowkey living vicariously through me. She doesn’t show any signs of feeling uncomfortable when I talk about Lexi.

Andrea, Kacey, and my other childhood best friend all go to the mall together the day after we break up. These are people Andrea has known well for 2 years, but people I’ve been best friends with my whole life. I know Andrea doesn’t have friends the way I have friends, so I kinda made myself a deal in my head that I wouldn’t make a stink about Andrea being best friends with my best friends, as long as she was kind of weening off of them and at least trying to be friends with other people. Because I think my childhood best friends are loyal and that Andrea will understand what’s appropriate, I think this is a decent plan.

Summer rolls around and me and Lexi have started dating (we started dating early April). We signed a lease that starts in June (UHaul Lesbos), and I live in between my college town and home town (my dad still lives in my hometown so I live with him). Being close in proximity to my old relationship makes things sink in and forces me to process things with Andrea. The good thing about being in my hometown is that Kacey is there and we can hang out when we both don’t work. February to May were wonderful because I was embracing being single for half of it, and then the other half, I was so deep into a honeymoon phase. Me and Lexi were together everyday and I found out what it feels like when two people are suited for each other (this didn’t feel anything like when me and Andrea were together).

Everything in my relationship with Andrea hits me at once. It truly sinks in that she was not nice to me, or to anyone really. Being away from Lexi and feeling all of this on my own is super difficult. Of course I can turn to Kacey because she’s my best friend. It’s been almost 4 months since me and Andrea broke up and I’m kind of shocked that Kacey and Andrea still hang out. I knew they were friends but I also thought they’d kind of understand it’d make most sense for Andrea to make other friends, so Kacey can support me, her best friend, better. They were friends because of me. Andrea even told Kacey that she’d understand if they had to stop hanging out because I’m back in town. Of course, I never want to give anyone an ultimatum, and I shouldn’t have to control my friends’ friendships for them to be friends with me. Things are best when they’re not forced.

Me and Kacey often drive around and get coffee and talk about life, and because of how much I’m struggling, I often reveal a lot about my relationship with Andrea to Kacey and after the fact realizations I’m having now. I also ask a lot of questions about Andrea and what she has to say about me. These questions make Kacey uncomfortable because she’s friends with both of us, and I get that, but I also keep pushing for answers. I understand this isn’t right of me. I do not understand what Andrea has that is so compelling (she isn’t very driven, cool, doesn’t have many friends, not very smart (and this isn’t just my opinion, all my friends who have cut Andrea off say this, too)). 

I tell Kacey it’s really hard watching them be friends while I’m starting to realize that Andrea was borderline emotionally abusive and manipulative toward me. Kacey says she won’t pick sides, but to me, it’s feeling like not picking a side is picking a side at this point. Kacey also tells me that she was there for a lot of me and Andrea’s relationship and she didn’t think Andrea was mean, she just thought we weren’t fit for each other (keep in mind Andrea didn’t act different around Kacey, I just kept my cool and never wanted to embarrass Andrea, but Kacey watched Andrea violate me and call me an elephant everyday. She would also watch me laugh along, but not me telling Andrea it makes me feel bad. I sometimes opened up to Kacey about it making me feel sad, too. Kacey did watch me and Andrea have screaming matches that would usually start because Andrea was purposely pressing my buttons to upset me. It can look like one big joke, but it never feels that way to the person whose boundaries are being violated.)

Fast forward to middle of the summer, me and Kacey have had multiple emotional conversations through text about how I’m violating Kacey’s boundaries by asking questions about Andrea. I see how I made her uncomfortable and how she feels in the middle, but I also feel like I should be able to process how I feel with my best friend, because I’d do that for her. At this point, it seems Kacey is upset that I crossed her boundaries and feels uncomfortable and in the middle, and I’m getting frustrated and sad that she feels in the middle because if she was a loyal friend, she’d take what she knows from me and stick to my side. I have no clue what Andrea has said about me because Kacey hasn’t revealed any of it. We stop talking for the rest of summer, and we text now, but Kacey is super cryptic in her texting and it doesn’t feel the same. Of course it’s not going to feel the same, but I confronted her and was like “do you still wanna be friends? are we on the same page?” and she said yes but she’s not ready to hang out in person (I’d asked her multiple times and she’d lie and say she’s busy). She was scared the more we’d talk, the more we’d talk about me and Andrea’s break up so that’s why she wouldn’t communicate. I still believe we need to talk about it to get through it, whether we want to or not. 

I don’t know if I was an asshole to Kacey or if this is reasonable of me. It’s also hard because I sometimes wonder if I’m exaggerating what happened in me and Andrea’s relationship. Like what if Andrea wasn’t that mean and I’m just being crazy? I’ve said that before and my friends say the fact that I’m questioning it is like a sign of me being a victim. Let me know what you think, I don’t really know what to do with Kacey anymore. I miss her more than I’ve missed anyone, but I feel like she’s not as loyal as I thought.",0,1734549646.0,AITAH,0,0.5,False

It is clear to me that he loves me or at least feels an attachment to me, but surely if he respected me, my time, and our relationship he would make more of an effort to change his ways?

The main issue:
I can’t stand when people say one thing and do another, as in when they are flaky and cancel plans. And he does this often. And every time it upsets me and I make this clear. And he rarely apologises. 
For example:

• he will tell me that he can hang out with me on a weekend day, then will show up and say that he’s leaving early to go and have dinner with his parents or watch football with his friends. or he will text me mid-afternoon saying that he will come over later (like after 6pm) because he is doing the above before seeing me - we never spend a whole day together

• he will tell me he is free on a certain weeknight, then when I ask for confirmation of our plans he will say that he has last-minute after-work plans with his co-workers

Specific examples: 
• on one occasion, I asked in advance if he could pick me and my friend up from a concert in another city (45 min drive) because there weren’t many trains running and I was anxious about getting home late because I had work early the next morning. He agreed, then when the concert day came said that he couldn’t make it any more with no explanation or apology, then I had a hard time getting home

* he had two weeks off work as he was changing jobs. I thought we could spend some quality time together and came up with a list of activities but he had made other plans that he had never mentioned to me - he was going on a trip with his parents, then one with his friends, then another one with different friends. I found this very hurtful because if I had time off I would want to spend it with him and he had clearly never considered me so I tried to break up with him but he convinced me to stay 

• he said he would take me out for a birthday dinner. I went on a trip abroad with my friend over my actual birthday. I saw him the day after I came home. I asked if we could have the birthday meal another day because I had ate a lot of indulgent meals on my trip and wanted a healthy nutritious vegetable-heavy meal so I cooked one. We never went on the birthday dinner, as if I had forfeited it by wanting vegetables on that one day. I had only known him a month when it was his birthday and I went for a meal with him (only paid my half) and bought him a small cake with candles (he knew me 7 months by mine) 

• he asked a month in advance if I could get a weekend off of my work so that we could go on a weekend away. A week before the weekend away, he said we couldn’t go any more because his work Christmas party was that Friday. I was affronted and tried to break up with him but he cried and insisted he loved me and wanted us to work it out. However, a week later:

• he stayed at my house in lieu of going on the weekend away (we hadn’t stayed overnight together before as both live with parents and I work weekends). I met him around 1:30pm on the Saturday and believed we were spending the weekend together, because that seemed a natural assumption. We went out on Saturday and on Sunday morning (11:30am), he said he was going to meet his friend in the afternoon (1:30pm). I was very hurt and upset because I thought we were going out - I’d mentioned getting coffee and going a walk and he had agreed - and I couldn’t believe he was doing the same thing I’d just tried breaking up with him over again just a week later. I felt exhausted and said I was fed up with him not prioritising me. I didn’t talk to him for a couple of days but he said he wanted to talk. He had something of mine that I wanted back so once again he cried and was very upset, and once again I felt bad for him because I clearly have no self-respect so gave him another chance. 

I feel conflicted because I feel like this is too many issues to have had in a relatively short relationship. The problem is that, like I said, I feel like it should just be an easy fix - that he should treat me as more of a priority, and honour the commitments to plans we have made, and be open about plans that we do make. He said he would do this, but now I’ve learned that he’s made plans to go on an expensive two-week holiday to a different continent with a friend, when he couldn’t even follow through on plans to go on a weekend away with me to the countryside 2 hours away, or a birthday dinner with me, or a regular after-work dinner date with me. Is it a lack of respect, or is it a blind spot when it comes to thinking of me, like it just doesn’t cross his mind? 

I feel conflicted because I know there is love between us. And because I’ve had a hard time dating, and I read so much about others’ situationship ordeals and I don’t want to re enter that world of dating apps and ghosting and uncertainty. I just feel like I would have worse issues with anyone new, especially based on my past experiences - the three other guys I’ve fleetingly dated (for 1 week to 2 months) also cancelled often, were nonchalant, didn’t text consistently, didn’t listen to me (one forgot my birthday and never made up for it), one was insecure and accused me of talking to other guys when I wasnt, one laughed at me when I got hit by a bike which was his fault (he had pulled me onto the road to cross even though the bike was approaching), and one pressured me into sex which is a situation I would be scared to end up in again if I dated. 

And I have a Christmas present for my boyfriend that would be an awful waste… He is kind (when he isn’t acting the way listed above) and thoughtful and funny and clever. He listens to me talk about my day, laughs at my jokes, holds my hand when we walk because I like it, cracks and massages my back when it’s sore, drives because I don’t like to, drives me home even though it’s 30mins from his, helps cook and washes dishes without complaint, has always texted consistently, and tells me interesting random facts. Even though I doubt how much he respects me, I’ve never had to question if he’s actually interested in me romantically. I do feel a connection with him like I haven’t experienced with previous romantic interests, so I would be sad to let him go (which is why I have given him several chances). 

I recognise that my problem is that I just want to meet the love of my life and love them forever - someone to spend time with, share experiences, talk to, laugh together, etc. I dated the same person from high school til age 22 so I had comfortable future plans and find dating scary and tedious and heartbreaking - i just want someone who could be ‘my person’ again, but for good this time. I recognise my other problem is that I’m quite lonely and have little social life so I’m really anxious when meeting new people and I find it so difficult and painful to let people go because then I’m alone again - my hobbies are really solitary (gym, reading, baking, walking) so I only really talk to my family and people at my work. I’m not sure what to do. 

I always thought that starting to write a reddit post is all the answer you need - but life is complicated and I wonder if anyone thinks this could work out (or if I need to suck it up and cut my losses and try to move on).

1hh9acy,https://i.redd.it/1uvbi8g8qn7e1.jpeg,Passed,"Hello everyone! I recently passed my Step 1 and wanted to share my experience. I personally have benefited a lot from this group. Reading pass write ups and underdog stories can be morale lifting. This is my first post on this group although I comment from time to time as I have been a member for quite a while. Some people might relate to my situation and my write up might help or encourage someone else. I am currently doing my MPH in the US while also working. I recently saw a post about if it is possible to do an MPH and study for the exam at the same time so this is to let you or anyone else know it is possible. 

Resources Used:
- Question Banks: UWorld 
With regard to the UW world, i previously had access to the real uworld which I paid for 1 year and expired earlier this year and then was not able to take the exam at the time. I did about 70% of the uworld lightly and spread across a long time do definitely was just not really into taking the exam at that point. So honestly couldn’t pay again for uworld this time. So this time around, I got the iMD app. And whenever I saw a post about if it is reliable, I always just ignored because I was not in the right place to say yes when I was also yet to take the exam. Now that I have, I can say that the iMD is a very good app. Ofcourse if you have the money to get uworld, go for it because the interface is better and all but if you cannot, iMD is good too as it gives you a test setting unlike pdfs. Also the iMD comes with NBME 20-31 which I did all. This saves you the stress of having to mark the answers yourself. It really help being able to just submit and see your score. The iMD has explanations for the 36-31, and also has the UWSAs, I only used the UWSA 3 because I still had the 1 and 2 that came with my original UW subscription. 
- Practice Tests: NBMEs, UWSAs and Free 120s (I will attach the picture below)
- Content Review: Did BNB initially last year, then Pathoma, First Aid, Mehlman PDFs (if you can read them all if not neuroanat, repro, hema, biochem and immuno. The rest based ok your weakness) 
- Others: Sketchy Micro, Dirty Medicine. For pharm I did the melhman pharm combined PDF i found here along with first aid and dirty med. 

Like I said, I am currently working and doing my MPH degree so I couldn’t take off and do a dedicated as my status in the US depends on being an active student. Anyway, I read anytime I could. Solved Uworld anytime in the bus. One thing I wished I found earlier was mehlmans youtube page. He drops daily nuggets or two which I can just get through in 5-10 mins. Questions that you can just play and attempt and reason. He then explains the logic of why it is and why it is not. I literally checked every day and I think it really helped because I started thinking from a bigger picture and it helped in the exam. 

For my exam day, 
It was long, you already know. I had a light meal before going. Building up to the exams I took practice exams every weekend and tried out energy drinks to see what it would be like since normally I don’t take energy drinks or coffee so I just started programming my body and got used to taking it in bits between blocks. For the exam, I split the block into 2 parts, each 20 questions shouldn’t take more than 25 mins so just used that as a pointer to know when to speed up. 

As for the content, I wouldn’t say everything was from the NBME and FA because there were questions I remembered word for word and checked and the concept was in FA but then the options definitely were not. But in all, there are enough normal concepts on the exam that should make it passable if you get your concepts right. 

Came out feeling not bad but not confident either. Last two weeks have been long especially when your brain is calm and suddenly you start remembering “oh that question should have been that” randomly daily. Was relieved that I got my pass result, not because I was not confident I would pass, but because I got tired of having my sleep ruined by questions I remembered. 

See you all in step 2. I tried to be as detailed as possible because I might not be able to answer questions due to my schedule.

I was so upset to find out they they changed their menu and my meal. I think the worst part is almost that they didn’t completely take the meal away, they just decided instead of a platter where everything is separate they would put it all in a bowl together.  Who TF thinks, oh, let’s pile all of this together WITH a Mediterranean salad. 

I tried to be chill about it and just ordered a couple similar items but I was anxious because I didn’t know if I would like it and it wasn’t what I get.

>[$20-50](https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftIdeas/?f=flair_name%3A%22%2420-50%22)

>Hi all!

>I am looking to get my partner one or two more gifts with each being in the 20-50 range.

>A little about her. She is incredibly practical. She doesn't like having a lot of ""junk"" (her words) like knickknacks or most decor items. She loves video games like The Witcher, Fallout, and Red Dead Redemption. She tends to buy things she needs for herself, so necessities like quality underwear or socks are not an option. The only things that she does enjoy having merch/gear from is video game merch or stuff surrounding her job (she's a police officer).

>She enjoys going out to do things for date nights. She especially loves the aquarium and the gun range. Though she really doesn't enjoy zoos. She's shown some interest when we went to a local theater production, but I think that was because of that particular play.

>I've been able to think to get my partner a spot in a motorcycle class so she can get her license, a t-shirt with a logo from her favorite game (Fallout), and a cologne. My family have already gotten her a multitool for work.

It sounds like your partner has a very practical, minimalist approach to life, with a clear preference for items related to her hobbies and needs. Based on what you've shared, here are a few gift ideas that could align with her interests and style:

# 1. Gaming-Themed Apparel

* **Why it’s a good idea:** Since she enjoys video game merchandise, but likely wants to avoid clutter, a high-quality, subtle piece of clothing could be perfect. Think of a sleek hoodie or a minimalist t-shirt with a logo from *The Witcher*, *Fallout*, or *Red Dead Redemption*—something she could wear often and is functional but still has a bit of personality.
* **Where to get it:** You can customize apparel with her favorite game logos from sites like Printful: [Fallout T-Shirt](https://www.printful.com/personalized-gifts/a/index).

**Budget Tip:** If you want something more budget-friendly, an *official Fallout* shirt or jacket from Amazon could work well. [Fallout Merch on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=fallout+t-shirt&tag=gifts-favspro-20)

# 2. Gaming Mouse or Accessories

* **Why it’s a good idea:** If she’s into gaming, an ergonomic gaming mouse, keyboard, or even a comfortable mouse pad could be an ideal, practical gift that enhances her gaming experience.

* **Where to get it:** Book a session at a local VR hub, or you could even consider a VR starter kit if she doesn’t own one yet (though that may be a little above budget, depending on options).

# 16. Smart Water Bottle with Hydration Reminders

The room felt like a time capsule of chaotic nerd culture: faded posters of ancient sci-fi movies plastered the walls, a “mood lamp” shaped like a lava planet sat in one corner, and the coffee table was buried under piles of snack wrappers and unopened mail. Tonight, the trio had gathered to watch an obscure, cringe-worthy masterpiece that Ellis had found in a dusty bargain bin: “Crimson Starlight Saga: Love Beyond the Asteroid Belt”, a corny anime movie infamous for its melodramatic plot, laughable dub, and gratuitous fan service.

  


From the moment the title sequence started, it was clear they were in for a *ride*. A poorly animated space station spun awkwardly in zero gravity, while a power ballad blared in the background with lyrics that sounded like they’d been translated by someone using a thesaurus and guessing wildly.

  


Ellis, as expected, was hooked. “Oh my GOD, you guys,” he exclaimed, clutching his bowl of chips like it was the holy grail. “Do you see her? Do you *see her*? Look at Princess Lyre! That hair. That attitude. That inexplicably impractical battle armor—she’s *everything*.”

  


Onscreen, Princess Lyre—a space princess whose entire outfit seemed to consist of strategically placed strips of glowing fabric—pointed her plasma sword at the male lead, yelling something about the fate of the cosmos resting in their love. Her hair defied the laws of physics, flowing majestically in a wind that did not exist.

  


“Ellis,” Zara groaned, slumping deeper into the couch. “She’s literally just a walking male fantasy. That outfit wouldn’t protect her from a *light breeze*, let alone a space battle.”

  


“It’s symbolic,” Ellis said, gesturing wildly with a chip in hand. “She’s unburdened by the shackles of convention. Also, it’s fashion.”

  


“It’s impractical nonsense,” Zara retorted. “Her character design was clearly created by a committee of middle-aged men with dubious internet histories.”

  


Meanwhile, Maximillian was furiously typing notes into his tablet. “This entire premise is an insult to logic,” he muttered, glancing up at the screen every few seconds. “You’re telling me this ‘Princess of the Celestial Throne’ has the technical knowledge to reprogram a quantum warp engine, but she doesn’t wear *a helmet* when flying into battle? Are we just ignoring basic safety protocols?”

  


Ellis waved him off. “Max, it’s *not* about safety. It’s about *aesthetics*. Do you want her to wear, like, a boring jumpsuit? She’s the *heart* of this galaxy! She has to look good while saving it.”

  


Zara groaned, tossing a popcorn kernel at Ellis’s head. “Ellis, if you simp any harder for this fictional woman, I’m going to call a doctor. Your thirst is *concerning*.”

  


Onscreen, the male lead—a generically handsome pilot named Rax Starblade—stared broodingly into the distance, his jawline gleaming under the soft, inexplicable light of twin moons. Princess Lyre leaned against him in an overly dramatic pose, her expression torn between love and anguish.

  


Max squinted at the screen, his analytical brain kicking into overdrive. “Why are the twin moons *purple*? That’s not how celestial bodies work. If they’re reflecting light from their star, they should be—”

  


“Max,” Zara interrupted, pointing a pretzel stick at him, “if you try to apply astrophysics to *Crimson Starlight Saga*, I’m going to revoke your movie privileges.”

  


“Fine,” Max said, folding his arms, though his indignation was palpable. “But can we at least address the camera angles? Every shot of Princess Lyre is framed like it was filmed by someone lying on the ground, looking *up* at her. It’s ridiculous.”

  


Ellis laughed, clearly unfazed. “It’s called *dramatic emphasis*. They’re showing how powerful she is!”

  


“Dramatic emphasis, my ass,” Zara shot back. “It’s blatant fan service. Half these angles are just excuses to zoom in on her…uh… assets.” She gestured vaguely at the screen, where the camera had indeed decided to linger on Lyre’s unnecessarily sparkly thigh armor as she struck yet another impractical battle pose.

  


Max nodded sagely. “It’s a well-documented trope in anime. I’ve read multiple essays on the cultural implications of—”

  


“OH MY GOD, MAX, NOBODY CARES!” Zara shouted, hurling another popcorn kernel, this time with more force. “We get it. The angles are weird. Let’s move on.”

  


Ellis raised his hands in protest. “Hey, *I* care! Lyre is a *queen*, and if the camera wants to appreciate her, who am I to complain?”

  


Onscreen, the action ramped up to absurdity. Rax piloted a giant mech shaped like a flaming phoenix while shouting, “LOVE WILL LIGHT THE GALAXY!” Princess Lyre stood dramatically on the mech’s shoulder, throwing glowing star daggers at a fleet of vaguely phallic alien ships. The animation quality took a nosedive as the explosions devolved into a chaotic blur of neon colors.

  


“Why is she on the mech?” Max demanded, his voice laced with exasperation. “She could just *pilot it* like a normal person! Standing on top of it in space makes no sense!”

  


“It’s symbolic,” Ellis repeated, gesturing like a professor explaining art to uncultured students. “She’s above the fray, Max. A beacon of hope. Also, it looks cool.”

  


“She’s going to fall off and die,” Max muttered darkly.

  


“Good,” Zara said. “Then this movie can finally end.”

  


But the movie refused to be outdone. In its final act, Princess Lyre and Rax stood atop a crumbling asteroid, gazing into each other’s eyes as a collapsing supernova loomed behind them. The music swelled to an ungodly crescendo, complete with a key change so dramatic it could’ve shattered glass.

  


“I’ve always loved you,” Lyre whispered, her voice trembling. “From the moment you crash-landed on my moon colony and challenged my honor with your rebel spirit.”

  


“And I you,” Rax replied, his hair inexplicably blowing in a wind that definitely shouldn’t exist in space. “From the moment you stabbed me in the leg during that duel.”

  


Ellis clutched his chest, clearly moved. “This is *art*. Pure, unfiltered art.”

  


“It’s *garbage*,” Zara groaned. “This is the cinematic equivalent of a Hot Pocket that’s still frozen in the middle.”

  


The movie ended with a blinding explosion that consumed the screen, followed by an abrupt cut to black and a single line of text:

  


“Love is the light that guides the universe.”

  


The room was silent for a moment as the credits began to roll, listing names no one could pronounce and thanking an improbably long list of animation studios.

  


Finally, Zara spoke. “That was, without question, the worst thing I have ever seen.”

  


Ellis grinned. “And yet you watched the whole thing.”

  


“Only because I wanted to see if Lyre would finally fall off that stupid mech.”

  


Max closed his notebook with a sigh. “I’ll admit, it had… some moments. But the scientific inaccuracies alone make it hard to enjoy.”

  


Ellis leaned back on the couch, looking smug. “You guys just don’t appreciate the finer things in life. Crimson Starlight Saga is a *classic*. A misunderstood gem.”

  


“Misunderstood,” Zara repeated. “Like a traffic accident.”

  


Max smirked. “Or Ellis’s taste in women.”

  


Ellis gasped, clutching his heart like he’d been mortally wounded. “I’m sorry, have either of you *met* a space princess? No? Then your opinions are invalid.”

  


Zara threw one last popcorn kernel at him, this time hitting him square in the forehead. “Space princesses aren’t real, Ellis. But bad movies? Those are very, *very* real.”

so anyway, about me? I am 26, living in the UK but hopeful to move one day. I work for a very popular company that I cannot say the name of, but you'll have heard of them before. My primary passion in life has always been my work and I feel like it's time that shifted to someone else, so that's why I am here! maybe you'll be the lucky person! What am I looking for you ask? I have no idea, friends, lovers, haters, who knows.

I am an avid reader, my bookcase is full of books i've yet to read and a lot of I have read and cannot come to terms with giving away. If I am not reading I will likely be sat under a blanket somewhere in my house playing video games. As with most people on Reddit, I am indeed a huge nerd. I love to code & paint too! I am really just spraying my thoughts onto this right now, there is only so much you can say about yourself without writing a life story.

As for other things I like to do:

- Stumble into things, I am very clumsy. Drink an ungodly amount of coffee, listen to music far too loud on my headphones, order too much food for myself and regret it later, pretend like I understand politics, suck at boardgames and sing karaoke.

happy to swap photos etc. just don't be super weird or uninterested in talking. I am also not picky about where you are from, so don't let that put you off :) hope to speak to you soon

1hh91xi,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hh91xi/theres_something_in_the_coffee/,There's Something in the Coffee... ,"I’ve been awake for eighteen days. 

That's not hyperbole or any form of exaggeration. I've genuinely gone all this time without any sleep or rest. 

Not even a wink.

And the craziest part is that I don't feel like I need it. I don't know how I'm still alive. These last few days have been some of the craziest of my life, and I feel like it's about to get much worse. 

It all began on the eve of one of my exams. The dreaded finals week had come around, and although I had studied for it throughout the month of November and prepared myself to the best of my ability, it was still getting to me. Something about having a considerable portion of grades dependent on one test… just never sat right with me. 

I had been lying in my bed for the past three hours, tossing and turning, frustrated, unable to allow myself to slip into that glorious world of slumber. It was 4 a.m… and my next final was…. At 8... 

Eventually, I’d had enough, so I decided to get out of bed and pull an all-nighter to do some extra studying. After all, staying up through the night had always been better than dozing off for two hours and then being rudely awoken, surprisingly enough. 

So, with that, I sighed, got up from my bed, and started putting on my clothes. I headed out the door into the warm, humid Floridian air. The campus library was open, as was to be expected; they were always available 24/7 during this time.

The building was entirely still. The information desk was open, and some poor soul who had taken the student job was staffing it overnight. I looked over, and she didn't even move her head to notice me, staring blankly at the screen ahead of her. 

There were other people in here, too, just not a lot. Now and then, you'd see the occasional chair filled by a zombified student, a cup of coffee in one hand, their laptop in the other, and a lovely pie of pizza resting on the table in front of them. 

*Typical.* 

In the center of the main lobby stood a beautifully crafted table with a white cloth draped over it. On top were two big metallic cylinders, coffee dispensers, with a basket containing a bunch of small paper cups to the right. Further to the side a variety of creams, sugars, and sweeteners. 

The sight didn't surprise me. This school had a tradition of offering free coffee to all students in the late hours during this time. It was a nice gesture for everyone stressing out about their upcoming exams, I suppose. 

I'm not a coffee drinker —never was— I despise the taste. Still… it *was* 4 a.m., and I was about to stay up all night. So, with that in mind, I caved and filled up one of the paper shot cups, making sure to load it with so much cream that, frankly, you probably wouldn't be able to call it coffee anymore. 

With that, I made my way up the stairway to the right, which took me to the third floor, the computer lab. 

I approached one of the tens of empty computers, logged into my account, and pulled up my professor's PowerPoint presentation.

I practically gulped the coffee down in a minute, and it tasted about how you would expect.

But the texture, the texture was off…

As the hot liquid slid its way down my throat… I felt… something like a rough surface pass by my tongue. It was almost as if little tiny balls had been in the fluid, like cottage cheese, but a tad less noticeable. I didn't think much of it then, figuring it was probably something I put into the beverage, or something with this particular brand. And a quick look inside the cup revealed nothing unusual, so I quickly forgot about it. 

I was considering getting another one when, just ten minutes later, the caffeine took effect. It was insanely powerful, more than I expected. My heart was throbbing in my chest, as I was jolted into awakeness, and I felt like I had just slept ten hours.

There was an ongoing gag going around the school that they injected the coffee with jet fuel. Well, I guess now I know where that came from. 

Suffice it to say, I'm glad I didn’t follow through on what I was considering. I think I would've succumbed to cardiac arrest almost immediately. 

I continued studying until about 7 a.m. when the sun began to peak over the horizon. As I exited the building, stepping into the crisp morning air, I still felt perfect. The heart pounding in my chest was the only thing telling me that this period of energy was artificial.

I finally understood why people were such avid coffee drinkers, and I thought that maybe I should do this more often. 

It ended up taking until about 2 p.m. that day for the caffeine to wear off. At last, I could feel my body begin to slow down, and the full effect of the stunt I had just pulled came over me like a rock. It was like somebody had snapped their fingers, and I just… crashed… 

I decided to return to my bed and attempt to sleep off last night. Not for too long, though; after all, I had more finals in the morning. And thinking of that got my fear going once again. I said I had prepared the best I could, but the one that was coming up... Oh boy… No matter what I tried, I couldn't figure out half of it. And the thing was worth about 40% of my grade… If I didn't do well on this final, it would tank my class average.

A slight panic set in at the thought of it. I should mention that I have a mild case of anxiety. Not to the extreme where I get regular panic attacks, but just enough to make every testing situation about ten times worse than it is for anyone else. I tossed and turned for about thirty minutes in this pit of dread I was drowning in, when suddenly... something very peculiar happened.

My sleepiness disappeared again. It was just… gone… entirely and utterly vanquished. I didn't know what to make of it at first but blamed it on the adrenaline currently shooting through my veins. I decided to splash some cold water on my face and take a hot shower to calm down.

It didn’t help… two hours of laying there passed… nothing… It didn't make sense to me. It was as if the crash had just… ended…

As I wasn't getting any sleep, I decided to use this time to work some more. Being so worried about what was coming up and all, I did just that until about 11 p.m. that night… 

And again… I just… still didn't feel tired… I spent hours tossing and turning, hoping, begging myself to fall asleep, but no dice. 

I had enough at this point. 

I pulled out my phone and did a quick Google search on how long caffeine is supposed to last. Most results pointed me in the direction of four to six hours, with the more extreme estimates being up to twelve. This had already gone far longer than any of the websites suggested. 

I rationalized it away by saying that perhaps I was just sensitive to caffeine and that since this was my first real exposure, it would take a while for the effects to subside. 

I was going to crash eventually. I just needed to wait it out. 

But that didn't happen. It was now 4 a.m., and I was still lying awake in bed, feeling no different. I decided to spend the night studying again, very decidedly *not* taking any of the coffee this time, slightly annoyed that I would likely regret it in the middle of the next morning's final. 

I didn’t. 

Nothing had changed. And now, I was starting to get concerned. 

Did I have some adverse reaction or something? What was going *on?* I called my mom to ask what she had to say. She was equally concerned for my well-being and suggested I take a trip to the university's health center.

The best they could do for me was to recommend I take some medication and see if that fixed it, and she instructed me to call a doctor if it didn't.

I’m sure you can guess the results of that little experiment. 

Not only did the medication take no effect, but as I lay awake for hours, a chill sweat began to trickle down my skin. It started gradually, but it eventually became intense, such that my sheets quickly became drenched in the stuff. My head as well… was *throbbing; a piercing*, screaming headache shot its way through my brain, only getting worse, as if I had just been shot. 

There was a different kind of thumping in my head, though… one much more unexplainable. On top of the raging headache, I felt something else—a tiny, slight, unrhythmic tapping… seeming to occur in different parts of my brain. I paid close attention as it slowly moved from one side of my forehead to the other, then around the back of my skull, before continuing to wrap itself around. 

I didn’t know what to make of it. And that’s also where I drew the line.

Enough was enough. 

I was calling a doctor tomorrow. 

Well, I did so the following morning, and the response I got was something like, ""Sorry, the best we can do is give you an appointment in two weeks.""

*Great.* 

All praise the healthcare system, I guess. 

But, accepting it was the only thing I could do, I said, ""Okay,"" booked the meeting, and hoped it wouldn't worsen.

The following day was when things started to get a little scary. My mother nearly gasped when she saw me on FaceTime, saying I looked ‘paler than snow’.

I had to agree with her because, in the middle of our conversation, I got a sudden wave of extreme nausea, gagging harder than I ever had before. I hastily hung up the call and sprinted to the bathroom, just in time to empty my stomach contents into the toilet bowl. I sat there, retching for the next hour. All the while, the headache and those odd irregular feelings circling themselves around my brain continued.

And if that wasn’t bad enough, as I was donating my insides to the indoor plumbing, I swear I saw something move in the corner of my eye. It was brief… but it looked like an… odd, elongated shape slowly moving up the bathroom wall. I didn't get a good look at it, as it appeared to hurry out of view entirely before I turned around.

I searched the entire place, top to bottom, but there was no sign of the damn thing. It was like it had just… vanished… 

That was the final straw. 

I assumed the sleep deprivation was getting to me, and I was beginning to hallucinate, even though I still felt as awake as ever. But I didn't care anymore. Enough was enough; I could not, in any way, wait *two* *weeks* for an appointment. 

And so, without any options left, I picked up the phone and dialed 9-1-1. 

The paramedics arrived within minutes and I quickly explained the situation to them, and, after seeing how terrible I looked, they immediately put me on a stretcher and whisked me away to the local hospital. 

The two-hour wait in the emergency room was what I could best describe as miserable. I was stuck sitting on a cheap plastic chair in a sanitary, lit, open room surrounded by patients suffering from god knows what illnesses. The icing on the cake was that my symptoms continued to worsen throughout my entire stay. 

My vision was beginning to go hazy, and I swear I kept seeing something move in my peripheral vision, like what I found back in my apartment. 

Finally, after hours of torture, The doctor finally called me and escorted me to my new room. He introduced himself as Dr. Jones and ran me through some basic questions, you know, the typical stuff.

“How are you feeling, Kevin?”

“Terrible.”

“Have you taken any drugs recently?”

“Other than Nyquil? No…”

“Do you drink any alcohol?” 

“Very rarely.” 

It was just your standard, run-of-the-mill doctor's questioning, but soon, one toward the end caught my attention. 

“Did you drink any caffeinated beverages recently?” the doctor asked.

I stopped for a moment. ""...I mean, I *did* have a shot of coffee… but it was… three… four days ago?""

The doctor made a hum of acknowledgment, his expression considerate before shaking it off. ""Okay… well, that shouldn't be causing this, then… I'm going to be honest with you, Kevin: I'm not sure what's happening… So what we're going to do now is run you through a few tests to hopefully determine an answer… and if we can't find anything… then we might have to keep you here overnight to perform a sleep test.""

I snorted.

*Sleep test… right…* 

The preliminary tests went exactly as expected. They took some fluids, checked my blood pressure, and looked at my heart rate—all the standard stuff. Everything turned out negative for any sort of issue. My vitals were perfect… frustratingly so. 

And so, I was then quickly informed that they would be proceeding with the sleep examination that night. They escorted me to a place that looked more like a hotel room than a hospital. A big window at the far end would let in plenty of natural light during the day. There was another blurred-out window on the right side, and a neat little old-fashioned lamp stood on a nightstand. The bed itself looked rather cozy and had a lovely wooden finish as a headboard. If I weren't so ill, I would've admired it. 

After hooking me up to various pieces of equipment that I couldn’t even explain the purpose of, Dr. Jones spoke again. ""Alright… you're all set up, Kevin. Now, don't worry. We're going to be watching from the adjacent room the entire night, okay? So if you need anything… just ask.""

I nodded my head, the only response I could make in my current state, and watched as he handed me a couple of pills. 

""Oh, and one more thing, here is some Silenor for the night… it's an insomnia medication; it should be more powerful than the stuff you had before… Hopefully, it might have an effect."" 

After I swallowed what he had given me, the doctor made his way out of the room and turned off the lights before closing the door. And just like that, I was left with nothing but complete, overbearing silence, broken only by the gentle hum of machinery. 

As my eyes hadn't adjusted yet, darkness swallowed everything. I gently eased my head back into the pillow and shut my eyelids, hoping to finally catch some Z’s. The bed was really comfortable; in any other situation, I would've fallen asleep within minutes. 

But now… 

One hour passed…

Two hours passed…

I was beginning to get frustrated. It seemed that the tablet the doctor had given me wasn't helping. So I just lay there, staring at the ceiling for some time and holding my eyes shut.

Nothing happened until about midnight, and quite frankly, I wish it had stayed that way. I immediately felt the throbbing in my head return, and the gentle taps that seemed to be circulating around my entire head went into overdrive. It was more evenly spread now, too. Rather than being in specific locations, it was across what seemed to be the entire circumference of my brain all at once. I could almost*...hear…*it inside me, all the little contacts… like crinkling paper.

I sprung up to a sitting position, clutching my face in pain. My eyes had adjusted to the darkness now; what was once pure nothingness had brightened into a shadowy cacophony that ate the corners and walls of the room. The nausea returned, and stars pulsated through my vision, and just then… something caught my eye. 

It sounded in my ears too…coming from the dark, shadowy corner that lay just to the left of me…running smoothly and slowly up the wall. 

I looked over to the source of the noise, which was partially illuminated by the glow of the machinery, and what I saw made my heart drop. Tucked away where the left and back wall met each other was what appeared to be a black, slim, elongated tube of some sort… but no, it wasn't that. I peered closer at it, and I realized it had legs… hundreds and hundreds of little tiny legs squirming and latching onto the surface in unison with the noise. 

The animal slowly crawled its way upward, paying me no attention. Its long body wriggled in perfect harmony as it made its way towards the ceiling. 

 I stayed frozen in fear for a few seconds before I immediately launched up from my bed and screamed, practically ripping the equipment down from where it was standing, unleashing a loud crash.

The doctors stormed into the room and immediately turned on the lights, demanding to know what had happened. I was hysterical. My head was still pounding, it felt like my brain was constrained.

""The-there's something in the corner of the-""

But as I looked to point it out, what I had seen was gone. 

“Kevin… How long did you say you were awake for…?” Dr. Jones asked with concern. “It’s common with severe sleep deprivation that you may experience hallucinations… ”

It made sense, but what I had seen felt so... life-like…

Unsurprisingly the doctors informed me that they would have to cancel the sleep test because my ruckus of throwing everything to the floor managed to break the equipment I was strapped to, so… *yay me*. 

However, They said that they could retrieve all the data up until now and that they would be able to review it as soon as possible and decided it would be best to move me to a standard hospital room while they awaited my results. 

They could barely move me five feet before I started gagging, and soon the floor was greeted with a pristine covering formed from my stomach contents, delivered by yours truly. 

Jokes aside, I finally got a good look at what was coming out of me. It was filled with what looked like… tiny black spheres… I didn't know what to make of it; quite frankly, I was worrying about other things, but it seemed to stun the doctors for a moment, too. However, they quickly got back to the task and escorted me out into the hallway. I didn't see what became of my mess afterward. 

After getting into an admittedly less comfortable hospital bed, I finally had the opportunity to scroll through my phone. It was completely blown up with panicked messages from my mother asking me what was happening and demanding to know why I wasn't answering. I called her back, and the second she saw the medical bed behind me, she nearly exploded into tears. 

“What happened?!” she cried out. 

I explained everything that had been going on since I last called her: the sudden wave of nausea I experienced, calling 9-1-1, and the sleep test. We, or rather, she, came to the conclusion that she would fly down and visit me as soon as possible to hopefully get this whole situation sorted. It was… nice… a silver lining in all this awfulness. At the very least, I was going to be able to see my mother again. 

Doctor Jones interrupted our conversation, and after I said one last goodbye to my mother, he simply sat down and sighed. He was holding what looked to be a couple of sheets of paper in his hand. 

""Hey, Kevin…"" he started. ""So, we've been reviewing your sleep test data as promised, and well…"" He showed me what looked to be a graph with a long squiggly line complete with small valleys and ever-towering hills. ""Your brain waves… they're highly irregular… look."" He began tracing his finger along the jagged line. ""They are much more active than they should be… and they nearly go off the graph here when you had your… episode… It's highly alarming."" 

I stared at him in silence, not knowing exactly what to say. ""One thing's for sure; we're going to have to get a head CT done as soon as possible… I'll see how soon I can get you in for an appointment…""

I could barely utter an ‘okay’ before he left the room, and finally… I completely broke down. This whole thing… It was a massive nightmare. I had no idea why this was happening, and it seemed like even the doctors, the world-class professionals, did not have any semblance of a clue either. I just wanted this all to end; I just wanted to get some sleep, finally. I wanted to stop… *seeing* that creaturein the corner of my eye. But alas, I should’ve known my prayers would all fall on deaf ears. 

A few hours later, Doctor Jones returned and escorted me to the head examination room. It was small and white, with what looked to be some sort of control desk behind a wall in the front, and a large machine resembling an MRI taking up most of the space, making a lot of noise, far more than I had expected.

I lay down on the little bed, feet facing the device, and put my arms over my head as the assistant wheeled me into the machine. I can't lie; I had a certain amount of dread come over me. I knew this was all normal procedure and that it was going to be painless, but something about this was daunting.

Dr. Jones and the others returned to the control area near the entrance and advised me the scan was about to begin. However, I didn't even make it for what seemed like five seconds, when there appeared to be distress from the control center, and one of the assistants practically ran out of the room.

My heart began to pound in my chest.

Dr. Jones approached me immediately, a grim expression on his face. 

""Listen, Kevin…"" He sighed. ""Normally, CT scan results take weeks to get back to you, but we've seen some things here that I believe might have to be taken care of *now.”* 

He ushered me back to the area he had been in during the process and pointed at the computer screen, and I nearly gasped when I saw the image being projected. 

There was a picture of my head, which was to be expected, but there was something else. Wrapped around my brain was a long, bug-like creature with two big antennas at the front and an uncountable amount of legs; the whole thing bore resemblance to a giant millipede, yet, it was slightly fatter and was long enough to cover the entire circumference of my brain twice. There was something else, though; that… creature… looked precisely like the one I had been seeing in my hallucinations, albeit a bit smaller. 

My heart lurched in my chest as I stared at the unnerving image. I was feeling sick to my stomach, but not due to the illness this time. 

“What the *hell?!”* I exclaimed. 

""Yeah…"" Dr. Jones commented. ""I have no idea where this came from; I've never seen anything like it before… but we're going to have to get it out of you pretty fast.""

I could only bob my head in agreement, still lost in my thoughts. This… *passenger*… had been sitting inside me for god knows how long… was *that* what I felt when I experienced that tapping inside my head…? Was it that… *crawling around up there?* 

As if on cue, it started again. I paid closer attention this time, and I could really feel it—all those little legs skittering along my brain. I immediately dissolved into a blind panic, but that only seemed to make it pick up the pace. 

It almost seemed… excited… or stimulated in some way. 

My headache returned, and I collapsed to the ground, my fear briefly forgotten. Doctor Jones stood up to help me back to my feet and looked at me with a concerned expression. 

""Look, Kevin… I'll try to schedule surgery to get it removed as soon as possible… until then… just try not to think about it too hard… okay?""  

*Don't think about it too hard.*

That was easier said than done; how was I supposed to go back to my room and pretend something like this hadn't just made itself a home up there? My terror got worse as I was ushered back to my room. I still felt it the whole time… it had gotten active recently, and my symptoms were starting to flare up again. 

I was overwhelmed with illness the second I got back and immediately sprinted toward the bathroom. The substance I excreted looked the same as before… filled with those… weird black spheres. 

I didn't pay attention to it, though. I was still thinking about that *thing.* It had been *real*… maybe my visions hadn't been—but whatever that was had been living inside me this whole time. I tried, desperately, to calm myself down and tell myself it would be out in a day. That didn't make it any better. 

After finishing my rounds, I got up weakly to wash my hands.

And that’s when I saw it. 

Slightly above my eyebrows, in the middle of my forehead, was what appeared to be a massive bulge. It sat there, completely still. As I looked at it further, I realized it wasn't just that… It was a long, winding… bug-like cylinder that circled itself around my entire head. I could even see the pieces of my hair slightly displaced by the shape, as it sheathed beneath them.

I don't know what came over me. But somehow, all worry and tension immediately disappeared. I found my right hand slowly drifting up towards my scalp as if it had a mind of its own. I'd say I tried to stop it, but that would be a lie. It was almost like… like I was in some sort of trance. My mind had gone completely blank as my arm slowly hovered up further toward the anomaly.

Then… I touched it and squeezed it gently. It was soft, almost like some sort of sponge, but I didn't have much time to register it as it immediately squirmed away, darting out of view and behind my head at a speed that looked similar to a bullet fired from a gun. 

This is what finally ripped me from my state. 

I screamed and leaped backward, almost splitting my head on the bathroom tiles. I sat there breathing heavily for a moment, hyperventilating, nearly crying before I worked up the courage to look back into the mirror.

It was gone. 

I did a complete 360 to make sure, but no matter what angle I checked… it wasn't there anymore. 

My headache intensified once again, and I ran to my bed, curling up in the fetal position, tears streaming from my eyes. I remained like that for hours. The doctors had come in to check on me and see what was wrong… but after I explained what I had seen, they found nothing. Still, their presence helped calm me down a tiny bit. 

That night, I simply lay staring at the ceiling. I don’t think I would’ve been able to sleep even if I didn’t have this odd condition. 

Nothing else happened. But still, it was bad enough. The image of what I saw on the CT scan and what happened to me later in that bathroom was *haunting.* And no matter how hard I tried, I simply could not get it out of my head. 

My mom arrived the following morning, and I explained everything to her. She was understandably just about as freaked out as I was, but she relaxed a tad bit when I told her about the doctor's plans to remove what was now being dubbed a ‘parasite’.

My neurosurgeon, with a team of doctors, an assistant, and my anesthesiologist, came in a few minutes later, announcing that it was time to perform the surgery, and told my mom to remain in the waiting room. With one last hug, we said goodbye and split up, to hopefully see each other again once this was over.

""Don't worry. I'm going to take good care of you,"" my anesthesiologist reassured me as she prepared the machine. 

Bright, blinding lights sprang to life as the doctors prepared their tools and laid them out on the table next to me. I knew I wouldn't be feeling any of this, but still, I have to admit, it did give me a small pit in my stomach to see all of the sharp objects that were about to be used on me.

They stuck an I.V. into my arm and hooked me up to all kinds of equipment, including heart rate and blood pressure monitors. I listened as the rhythmic beeping sprang to life and tried to ease myself, staring into the piercing lights above. 

""Okay, Kevin,"" my anesthesiologist smiled. “Once I set this mask on your face, I want you to count down from ten in your head. I promise you will be asleep before you reach zero.""

With that, she gently placed it over my nose, and, slowly breathing in the chemicals streaming through the tube, I did as she’d requested.

10...

9…

8…

7…

6…

5…

0...

I reached the end of my ten-second countdown. I was still awake. I began to worry; nothing around me had changed. I tried to say something, to get up and tell the doctors that I was still there, but the second I tried to move, I realized I couldn't. I was locked in place, bound to the table, completely paralyzed. I couldn't even do so much as wiggle my fingers. 

My heart beat faster in my chest as I looked over at the anesthesiologist who was viewing my heart rate and other vitals, and thankfully, she seemed to realize something was wrong, too. 

""He's awake,"" she said bluntly, slightly confused as she stared at the screens in front of her. “Don't start yet; I'm going to increase the dosage.""

She turned some nob on the machine connected to my mask, and all of a sudden, I felt an intense surge of the stuff getting pushed through the tube, far more potent than it had been before, forcing itself into my nose. My paralysis was getting stronger, but I was still not falling asleep. 

I began to panic, as evidenced by the ever-increasing beeping on the monitor beside me. The anesthesiologist started to swear under her breath as she turned the dial up even more, almost bringing it to its max. But nothing was working. I lay there, awake on the table, unable to do or say anything, while the doctors all crowded around me, trying to get me to go under. 

Suddenly, the lights above me went out, and the room went completely dark. All the medical staff blurred into the sides of my vision, still and unmoving. What was once a soundscape filled with the frantic movement of personnel and nurses and the rapid beeping of machinery was replaced with complete and utter silence. 

I sat there, breathing heavily, and that thing began to scurry again, rushing as I felt it crawl all around my head. I wanted to throw up. It was incredibly disgusting, and it just wouldn't *stop.* 

There was something else, though. A couple of minutes passed, and something crept through the silence. A soft but noticeable crackling noise came from the far end of the room, something I couldn't see from here, slowly making its way ever closer. 

I stared into the distance in terror as the sound unmistakably began wiggling its way up the foot of my bed before changing slightly, now sounding like small, tiny micro taps on plastic.

It wasn't long before two creepy small antennas became barely visible, peering through the darkness, just into view. A couple of seconds later, the head arrived. It was here… the same creature I had seen on the CT scan, although it looked much larger.

It continued to work its way up the end of my bed and slithered down the other side. I tried to get up, to run, but the paralysis drug that the anesthesiologist had given me was doing its job; I was still stuck. I was left helpless, only able to watch in horror as it slowly squirmed its way over onto the bed and up onto my foot, giving me the sensation of hundreds of tiny little appendages pushing their way up my body.  

It was relaxed, seemingly unphased by all my struggles as it got closer and closer, gently wrapping its way around my limbs. I could look at it now; it definitely resembled a massive millipede, but no exoskeleton existed. Instead, what made up the body seemed to be a pale fleshy mass laced with a pattern of black marks strewn across the entire specimen. 

It reached my stomach and made a straight beeline for my face. I tried as hard as I could to hold my head back and keep it as far away as possible, but it was futile. All the while, the back half of it had just crossed over the far bed frame.

My eyes watered as it slowly crawled over my neck and made contact with my chin, its long antennas now taking up a good chunk of my vision. I didn't seem to be wearing my mask anymore. I don't know when it disappeared, but it was missing, which gave that thing the opportunity to reach between my lips with its little front legs and slowly pry open my mouth with a strength I wouldn't believe it had. 

I tried again in vain to turn my head to do *something* to counteract it, but nothing worked. The only movements I made were the spastic twitches of my muscles as I shook like a leaf. 

Once the creature had opened my mouth just enough, I gagged as it slowly began to crawl its way inside; I felt every movement of the tiny bug limbs creeping on my tongue, the fleshy mass slowly rubbing against the top of my mouth. I wanted to throw up so badly, to cough, but for some reason, those reflexes weren't working; all I could do was gag over and over again as its long, segmented body maneuvered its way in like a snake shedding its skin.

The head reached the back of my throat and began to work its way up towards the top of my skull. As I watched more and more of its body disappear behind my lips, I heard the sound, and then saw more and more of these creatures. Smaller ones began to appear at the sides of the bed and weaved their way towards me. Some crawled toward my face; others maneuvered themselves across every square inch of my body. 

I tried to scream, but nothing came out. I began hyperventilating, looking at the scene in front of me with terror; each time I looked, there were more and more, appearing out of thin air, exploring every little nook and cranny of me. A pounding, throbbing headache ensued, and above all that I felt the original parasite continue to crawl its way around in my brain faster than it ever had before.

I squeezed my eyes shut, praying for the nightmare to end.

After what felt like forever, the lights above me blared to life, and I launched out of the bed and let out a shriek as I flailed my arms around. I nearly smacked the hand of the anesthesiologist dead on as she immediately grabbed hold of my shoulders, trying to ease me back into the bed.

“Easy… easy…” she said.

I wanted to yell at her, but then I realized… everything I had just seen, all those bugs… those *creatures.* They were gone. It was just me and the doctors in an operating room with a highly rapid heartbeat monitor. 

I took a second to collect my bearings and looked at the mask sitting on the bedside table; they had taken me off the medication. 

I instantly collapsed into tears and begged for my mother.

""We're going to have to try something else…"" one doctor said, ""Removing it isn't going to work if we can't get him under."" 

I nearly tackled my mom when I saw her again and explained everything about my horrible experience in that operating room. 

Dr. Jones came in a couple of minutes later, with a grim expression. ""Okay, Kevin…I am sorry about what you just went through. For now, we've decided that we're going to try and give you some anti-parasitic medication and see if that will help your condition. I hate to tell you this, but the medical staff is… a little lost right now because you've been infected with a species we've never seen before, so we'll call in some researchers to better understand your condition. 

My mother immediately stood up in protest. “You are *not* going to run experiments on my son!”

Dr. Jones simply looked at her with professionalism. ""They aren't experiments, ma'am… we're just going to study the best course of action to hopefully kill or get this parasite out of him. And besides, it's Kevin's choice…""

They both looked at me, and I sighed. I desperately wanted this as far away from me as humanly possible, and so, with nothing left to lose, I accepted. 

The next seven days, my condition didn't get much better. I had been awake for thirteen days at this point. But it was weird because despite how horrible I felt, I still didn’t feel the need to sleep. I still felt just as awake as when this whole thing had begun, and at this point, I had resigned myself to not feeling sleepy ever again until this was over. 

I requested to spend my nights with my mother because, after my surgery encounter, I didn't want to be lying in my room alone at night, and the presence of my mother helped put me at ease. She even taught me to laugh about it all a little, and as time went on, mysteriously, the hallucinations became slightly more diluted, something which the researchers quickly picked up on.

Oh yeah, at this point, I was also being watched by a team of them 24/7. I was doing constant tests, scans, the whole deal.

The anti-parasitics they were trying seemed to have no effect. I guess that was to be expected.

The next day, one of the researchers came in and told me he had an idea. My symptoms seemed to calm down when I was at a state of ease and flare up when I was stressed or scared so he proposed giving me a high dose of ketoconazole, a medication that's supposed to regulate my stress hormones. 

I tried it for two days, and the scientists' theories were all but confirmed because my hallucinations and all my other symptoms weakened significantly. A subsequent CT scan revealed the thing had grown much smaller than it had been before… it was starving. This is what led to the current theory that the parasite likely feeds off of stress hormones or other things your body produces during these periods. 

They continued this pattern for the next two days until my symptoms became so mild they almost didn't exist anymore. I was still stuck awake, but everything else had been diluted to an absolute minimum; the parasite on the CT scan looked like a shriveled husk of what it used to be. 

Dr. Jones came into the room that day and delivered a message that almost made my stomach drop. He said that, if possible, he would like to try the surgery again, given the thing had gotten so weak that the researchers didn't think it could overpower the anesthesia as it had before. 

I halted for a moment; on the one hand, I was eager to be done with this, but on the other… I didn't want to relive what I had. Dr. Jones assured me that they would be starting with a very low dose, and if they didn't notice an effect, they would immediately call off the operation. 

After a long debate between my mom and the doctors, we decided to proceed. 

Thankfully, the surgery went off without a hitch. 

When I came to, I finally saw the thing that had caused me all this trouble with my own eyes; it was dead, lying on the bedside table fully stretched out. It looked the same as what I had seen in my hallucinations, albeit a lot smaller. 

I even got to name the damn thing. ‘Neural Sleep Parasite’ had an excellent ring to it. Before long, they hauled off that monster for further study, and I never saw it again. 

They explained to me that I had most likely ingested its eggs when drinking that coffee back in the library, and that, combined with the high-stress response, allowed it to sort of take over my brain for a while. 

But I cut them off. I didn't want to hear more about this. I was done. 

I was released from the hospital a few hours later, got into my car, and drove back to my apartment with my mom. I know you will say I probably should have let her drive, but after all this, I was so eager to get back to a normal life. 

However, I regretted it very soon because the past eighteen days of no sleep hit like a truck in the middle of the journey. Without the parasite continuously stimulating my body, I needed to sleep again, and now my brain was about to demand I pay up the tab. 

Without realizing it, I began to doze off at the wheel in seconds and drifted into an oncoming lane. A shrill scream from my mom sitting next to me was the only thing that stopped us from slamming into a massive 18-wheeler with a combined speed of 140mph. 

I ripped the car back to the proper lane, adrenaline surging through my body. I immediately pulled over and let my mom take the wheel, realizing my stupid mistake. It goes without saying she drove me home the rest of the way.

Upon arriving at my apartment, I immediately made plans to dive into bed. It was time to catch up on those eighteen days of lost sleep. 

Or so I thought. 

Because immediately after I jumped under the covers… my tiredness… vanished… 

I began to panic but forced myself to think clearly. 

They said I ingested its eggs with that coffee… what if there was more than one… or what if it had laid more while it was inside me? Come to think of it, those odd black spheres coming out of me all the time were… unsettling; I just never thought to bring it up because there was always something else of critical importance happening…

I’m writing this now with a piercing headache, as all of my symptoms are beginning to rush back.

He mentioned to me a few months back about the portal and even though I am a gamer I hadn't heard of it. To be fair I'm out of the loop, I just had a baby 3 months ago. I know his gaming time has significantly decreased since then, he is an amazing father and this is our first child. Once in awhile he will unhook everything and bring the PS5 in the bedroom but most the time he is too tired for all that, and our bedroom tv sucks compared to the beautiful new huge one we got for our living room on sale last year lol. 

Anyway, I see so many posts about ""my wife won't let me open it til Christmas"". Meanwhile I am over here doing EVERYTHING I can to entice this man to open his gift. I wrapped it early and put it on the coffee table in front of his spot. (Which he called me out for immediately lol) he had Covid earlier this week and was home sick and I told him opening his gift might make him feel better. I even said that I didn't think the box would fit in the car for the trip to his mother's for Christmas, so he should probably just open it now. He is amused by my antics but also stubbornly telling me I must wait until Christmas. 

I even got him a really nice case with screen protector and a silicone glove thingy. I just want him to be able enjoy his games during his downtime because it's what makes him happy. He deserves it. 

Surprises have always been a weak point for me, along with patience. I feel like a toddler about to blurt it out at any moment. Like it literally feels heavy in my chest holding this secret in. Just open the dang gift!! ",15,1734548877.0,PlaystationPortal,12,0.94,False

I love his parents and getting to see them for the holidays, however both are in their mid-70s and staying with them can be a challenge at times. 
We stay for 6-13 days at at time and as an anxious person having a space that feels private/safe/secluded helps me to decompress day- especially after being “ON” all day. We both work remotely, so in the days around each holiday we are usually teleworking from their house as well- which adds up to a lot of time there. For the most part work days and the holiday itself are usually fine, except his mother is VERY overbearing. Putting it nicely she is an exceptionally attentive host, however so much so that I am bombarded with questions, offers to get me coffee or foods, and immediate hugs and kisses, etc. this starts the second leave our room and enter common spaces. I understand that she is coming from a place of love and kindness, but it’s overwhelming to step out of our room and immediately get offered everything in their home, and being greeted that way every single morning gets old very quickly. This usually continues throughout the day being offered various warm weather clothes, gloves, hats, more food, water, soft drinks (which I have never drank in the 5 years of seeing her)-repeatedly. Additionally, she goes into the room that we stay in to “pick it up”- emptying trash, giving us unasked for items (or items she overheard us talking about), and generally is in and out of our space very casually.  Again I understand the place of care this is coming from and it is her house, it makes me feel like a child with no privacy, and like I’m constantly having to prepare to politely decline things that we are fully capable of doing as adults.
I’ve had conversations with my fiance about how over bearing she can be when it comes to her hosting, and has private conversations with her she reiterates that “it’s just how she was raised” and does not seem to understand at all how uncomfortable this makes me as a guest in her house. When says something to her in front of people (ex-Mom she knows where XYZ is) she gets upset and reminds everyone that “she is still the host in her house”. I fully understand her wanting to host well, but I’ve expressed many times that just having privacy/ the feeling of privacy, will make the largest difference in how comfortable I am in their house & make me feel RESPECTED. However, we have never been able to successfully get this adopted. 
It makes me feel silly to have to keep re-iterating that if she could just ask before going into the room (or not go in at all), but each time I have to and it’s like I’m doing something to be a complaining? It’s starting to feel like my fiance is also getting sick of how I ‘can’t get over this’, but it’s honestly making me feel resentful towards her for not being able to understand something that feels so basic to me?",3,1734548296.0,AmItheAsshole,17,0.71,False

# Before everything, consider these before making a purchase:

* **Material**: Stainless steel for durability, glass for visibility, or plastic for portability.
* **Capacity**: Consider how much coffee you brew daily, smaller or larger sizes for personal or family use.
* **Insulation**: Double-wall insulation keeps your coffee hot longer.
* **Cleaning**: Look for easy-to-clean designs, especially dishwasher-safe options.
* **Durability**: Look for sturdy builds if you're using it outdoors or traveling.

# Recommended French Presses:

* **Mueller Austria 34 Oz French Press** (Best Value Stainless Steel French Press) - A durable stainless steel press with double-wall insulation to keep coffee hot and an easy-to-clean design. Ideal for home, office, or camping use.
* **Bodum 34 Oz Stainless Steel French Press** (Best Glass French Press) - A sleek press with double-wall construction, great filtration, and a comfortable grip. It can brew up to 12 cups and keeps your coffee hot for up to 2 hours.
* **Stanley 48 Oz Double Wall Insulation French Press** (Best for Camping) - Durable and perfect for outdoor use, this 48 oz press has double-wall insulation and a large capacity to keep multiple servings warm.
* **AeroPress XL Coffee Press** (Best Portable for Travel/Camping) - Ideal for travel or camping, this lightweight press makes up to two cups of rich coffee with a fast brewing method and is easy to clean.

I really hope this can help. If you want to see my entire work, you can do it on Requiremints site. I advised the team there and collected all top french presses in different price ranges, sizes and materials.

To preface mine: I'm a 50 year old, Cis/Het Man just making my way through my first RH novel, Hate by Tate James.  I thought RH would be a nice genre to try for some racy, escapist fun without all the trappings of male-authored erotica.  So far I'm enjoying it.  Anyways yesterday I brought the book (hard copy) with me to the coffee shop since there is often a bit of a wait, especially when I'm getting a bag of coffee ground.  When I went up to place my order I turned the book down on its' face but of course the two women behind the counter asked ""Oh what are you reading?""  Literally the first time I've taken the book out in public and busted already, lol.  I told them it was a silly, smutty, escapist romance novel and they laughed and gave virtual high-fives of approval.  I left out the ""Reverse Harem"" part because I was already blushing pretty bad and didn't want to make them uncomfortable.  
  
Anyways, just wanted to share that as I figured some here might get a kick out of it.  I've been enjoying reading the threads, interesting book suggestions and generally positive vibes here in this sub-reddit.  Cheers.

1hh8lrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Astroluma/comments/1hh8lrt/introducing_astroluma_simplify_your_digital_life/,🚀 Introducing Astroluma: Simplify Your Digital Life!,"Hey Redditors! 👋

After months of hard work and countless iterations, I'm thrilled to announce the release of Astroluma, a powerful dashboard designed to bring clarity and control to your digital life. It's live, it's free, and it's ready for you to explore!

# What is Astroluma?

**Astroluma** is an intuitive and feature-packed self-hostable home dashboard solution that combines productivity tools, app integrations, and device management under one roof. It's perfect for anyone who wants to streamline their workflow, manage their favorite apps, and stay organized—all from a single interface.

# Why Astroluma?

The name Astroluma is inspired by:

Astron: (Greek) meaning star.

Luma: (Latin) meaning light.

Together, Astroluma is a star illuminating your homelab galaxy! Astroluma offers feature that no other home dashboard is offering at the moment.

Interested? Let's have a look on the feature set:

# Features of Astroluma

2. Supports dual link. Links can be your internal IP or external domain. When Astroluma is opened using domain, automatically serves the domain link. Inside your network, serves the internal link or IP.
3. Allows copying or opening links in new tab easily.
4. Application integrations on link tile itself. 3rd party application support.
5. Inbuilt todo list allows you to stay organized with tasks. Multiple todo lists can be created. Tasks can be searched, filtered.

8. Inbuilt TOTP Authenticator allows you to generate TOTP MFA codes right on your dashboard, keeping you free from distraction while working.
9. Inbuilt network device scanner scans and lists out the device IP and MACs. You can assign them name for easy identifications.
10. Inbuilt Wake-on-LAN support. So you can turn your computers on right from the dashboard.
11. You can create and publish pages. WYSIWYG editor allows you to write and store rich text.

# User Interface:

1. The whole UI is super fluid and responsive. Specially optimized for mobile devices.
2. Comes with 12 beautiful themed color skins.
3. Inbuilt weather integration displays weather on the dashboard with beautiful icons.
4. Whole dashboard is modular so if you don't need a particular feature, just turn that off.

# Application Integration:

Astroluma comes with its own application engine. These integrations have access to the tile it is added as well as the configuration. This makes the integration independent in nature and easy to build and use. Following apps are supported at the moment:

1. Proxmox
2. NGINX Proxy Manager
3. Portainer
4. GitHub
5. Youtube
6. HTML Block

Further more and more applications are planned. A roadmap is WIP. I'll update the list soon once finished.

# Is my machine supported?

1. Linux/amd64 : 64-bit Intel/AMD CPU running Linux (including macOS and Windows through Docker Desktop)
2. Linux/arm64 : 64-bit ARM CPU (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4, AWS Graviton) running Linux
3. Linux/arm/v7 : 32-bit ARM CPU (older Raspberry Pi) running Linux

# Update Plans:

Astroluma is frequently updated. Bugs are on higher priority then features so reported bugs are treated on priority.

1hh8l2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1hh8l2z/need_advice_former_landlord_deducting_unfair/,Need Advice: Former Landlord Deducting Unfair Charges,"Hey everyone, I’d love your advice on a situation with my former landlord/management company.

I recently moved out of a tiny studio in London after a terrible experience—drunken neighbors, randomers moving in and being evicted for non payment, shady management, etc. I decided I'd had enough so gave my notice. My contract allowed me to give 14 days’ notice, which I did on the day rent was due, asking them to confirm the amount I owed for those 14 days.

Then the management boss called, claiming the 14-day notice didn’t apply unless the contract had ended (despite the contract explicitly saying “14 days notice can be given by either party at any time”). After waffling, he finally said, “Don’t worry, you’ve been a good tenant. Just pay the full month’s rent, and I’ll make sure you get your deposit.” At this point I realised he thought I was stupid, so said ""why would I pay for time I'm not here!"" Realising I'm not stupid, he bargained for me to pay for extra days, eventually settling on 3 extra days—plus rounding up “to buy me a coffee.”

I paid to avoid deposit issues but had alarm bells ringing over the way he tried to trick me. they never put my deposit in a scheme, referring to it instead as “advanced rent” in the contract. But in all email correspondence they call it a deposit plus I think he's used to letting anyone one rent, them disappearing and keeping the advanced rent. I’m of the few that’s actually given notice :|.

After I moved out (leaving the place spotless, with photos for proof), 

He emailed me asking if I wanted to reserve one of his other properties which will be available in Jan.
I’m sure he just wanted to avoid returning the deposit. I said no sorry I can’t commit to anything at the moment. 

Now on the last day they have to return my deposit(10 working days after leaving). They’ve sent an email saying they’re now deducting £300 for:
	
•	Cleaning (even though I cleaned thoroughly, and the place was filthy when I moved in).
	
•	Redecorating walls/ceilings (minor stains, most of which predated me—surely fair wear and tear?).
	
•	Replacing light bulbs (they never worked when I arrived—shouldn’t that be their responsibility?).

Key points:
	
•	No inventory was done at check-in or check-out.
	
•	They initially misled me about the 14-day notice and seem to be avoiding paying back my deposit.

• They’ve have spoke to me 7 days after offering another flat not mentioning anything about the inspection or deductions. 

I feel these deductions are unfair and want to dispute them. Should I take this to Small Claims Court to get my full deposit back (and maybe even the extra rent I paid)? Or should I let it go to avoid the hassle? I’m furious at the injustice but don’t know if it’s worth it.

Here are the photos of the flat’s condition when I left. [Property photos](https://imgur.com/a/b7IILOA)

What would you do? Any advice would be appreciated.

1hh8ku7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dysautonomia/comments/1hh8ku7/autonomic_dysfunction_testing_tomorrow_will/,Autonomic dysfunction testing tomorrow will probably be normal,"I just need to vent about my recent medical stuff. I’m mad that I’m getting better. I know, I’m being ridiculous. But sincerely, I figured it would happen right before this test I’ve waited months to have.

I do not meet criteria for POTS nor did I suspect I did. I don’t have the 30 bpm difference seated to standing all that often.

I was so sick of having normal BP/HR readings at the doctors and that leading them to not looking into dysautonomia. I have Graves’ disease but it’s been stable for a long time. My endocrinologist confirmed my dysautonomia symptoms from this year weren’t due to Graves’. I see that too, as my symptoms were different before I was on meds for it. I’m off my Graves’ meds now too.

So since I knew no doctor would believe me, I went really intense over the summer. I documented everything. I took my HRV and resting HR seated daily for a long time. I took a bunch of BP/HR readings. I even did tests where I stopped drinking my daily cup of coffee and stopped my ADHD meds to prove the symptoms persisted without those things. I’ve been off my ADHD meds for months now as well.

I made charts with all my medical info. My neurologist in October believed me. She saw the evidence. She started talking to me about GET, and I got upset because I have OSFED in my history and used to struggle with compulsive exercise. I also thought I might have ME/CFS bc I was getting what I thought was PEM when I did try to exercise. My neuro was really concerned about my exercise intolerance.

So thanks to my neuro, I finally have this testing. But of course, for weeks now, I haven’t flared as much. I’ve been taking more walks with my dad. I went from barely being able to sustain a 10-15 minute walk some days to handling half hour walks with my dad. I kept having the thought in the back of my mind that all the walking was making me better and that made me so angry, because this is going to be another expensive test that says I’m fine.

I know this is a really weird way to think. But hear me out. I have so much trauma from the mental health system as a late diagnosed autistic person. I know I have CPTSD. It got so bad when I was working in a career that I got sick and had to stop working. I’ve tried therapy so many times and just get more destabilized. I don’t know what else to do. I’ve spent years studying trauma recovery and I’m at a loss for what’s left.

But I feel like my doctors are just going to say it’s all my trauma now, and to treat that. I’ve tried. I do everything I can but I don’t get better. Yet of course, thanks to cold weather and some walks and whatever else, my chronic illness stuff is better.

I feel so awful. I even got a leg biopsy for SFN. I don’t have SFN and got my labs back today, but I have two scars on my leg as a reminder of all I put myself through to find answers. All of my labs my neuro put in came back normal. I have heterozygous MTHFR. My b12 and folate look great. I don’t have myasthenia gravis. My testing for MCAS came back normal even though I tortured myself by going off allergy meds for 5 days for it, which I take daily. I tested negative for Sjorgen’s too.

So after all these months of exhausting appts and labs, I have nothing. Just the diagnoses of Fibro + Graves’. My fibro is fine when I’m not stressed. I’m still seeing an endo specialist next year for that rule out but that’s pretty much it.

I just feel so guilty. That my family are paying my medical bills. It’s been such a hassle all to be left with nothing. I really do believe I have some sort of dysautonomia. I have experienced tachycardia, exercise intolerance, coathanger pain, and I’ve even had low BP a couple times. I fainted the morning after I tried Prazosin.

Idk if this makes sense but I’m so anxious for my testing tomorrow. I’m putting myself through so much stress, fasting and cutting stuff out, all to just torture my body and nervous system for a test meant to flare me that will just come back normal like everything else. It’s supposed to be 2.5 hours of testing. This sucks so much and is making me feel really anxious and ashamed.",2,1734547701.0,dysautonomia,0,1.0,False

I’m dealing with some things with my previous ex (domestic violence case) and it still traumatized me having to relive and tell my story to the police officers and detectives. Anyways, I told him I am not ready for a relationship or even dating— I wanted to focus on myself and my healing. He keeps pestering me and said that he’s been very consistent with me. So I was like fuck it, meeting him can’t be that bad so— on the date, he took me to a fine dining VIP restaurant where his friend who’s the manager works there. He seemed to know a lot of people there, I met them too. During our dinner, he sat very close to me and kept wanting to get physical like touching my hand, my leg playfully. We shared many laughs and joked around with me a lot. He also took a photo of us together and sent it to his Filipino gang(people who work for him), I’m also Filipino. During the date, I was very closed off and reserved - I felt the connection but I wasn’t ready to meet someone like him and I felt like he deserved better so I stayed reserved. But we still had many laughs. Also during the date, every 10 mins — his friend would always pass by our table and talk to us. He made some comments regarding my appearance saying I look like a model and where I’m from, that I’m from now on I’m also his friend. At the end of dinner, he seemed uncomfortable and tired — the manager asked what we will be doing after and we both didn’t say anything. He joked and said if we will be Netflix and chilling— his face got irritated. I jumped in and said maybe we’ll go play to go an arcade so things weren’t awkward. 
During the drive home, he told me that ‘are we seeing each other?’ or ‘are we still friends?’ — I didn’t say anything cause I don’t know how to answer it. The next day, I texted him and he seemed cold and distant — he was probably annoyed cause I kept texting him then finally Monday — he told me he didn’t want to continue the relationship and I’m right I’m not 100% ready and that he doesn’t a good energy right now. He keeps telling me I have a good heart and I should focus on my healing and personal goals. He also said let’s talk maybe in the near future when I’m better. 

I really liked him. I was disappointed that he decided to end things. He’s always the first one to watch my stories tho but doesn’t comment like he used to. His rejection created a little obsession on my end— where I’m constantly looking at his profile and message he sent. I’m really hurt. 

If he reaches out in the future, do I give him another chance? How soon is « near future »?
Before meeting him, he wanted to see me both days on the weekend. But he didn’t follow through. Am I delusional and I was the only one who felt there was chemistry and connection?",1,1734547648.0,u_Puzzleheaded_Job3024,0,1.0,False

[4gotmyusernameagain1](https://www.reddit.com/user/4gotmyusernameagain1/) Let's ask [Gift Ideas Ai](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-41Pnsy6eW-gift-ideas)

>[Is this okay as a gift?](https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftIdeas/?f=flair_name%3A%22Is%20this%20okay%20as%20a%20gift%3F%22)

>Hi everyone, dumb question - I recently bought some fancy whole bean coffee as a gift for my cousin, who loves coffee and is hosting me. However, I just realized she doesn’t have a grinder - only a Nespresso machine (I am already staying with her and noticed this while checking out her kitchen). Now I’m unsure if I should still give her the coffee, since I don’t want to create any inconvenience. This is the only gift I got for her, aside from gifts for her new baby. Should I go ahead and give it to her? I know in the US you can take it to stores to get them grounded, but she lives in a different country where I'm unsure if this is an option :(

It’s thoughtful of you to consider the practicality of your gift! Here are a few ideas to make sure your present is appreciated and useful without creating inconvenience:

# 1. Offer to Grind It Before Gifting

* If you have access to a grinder before presenting the gift, you could grind the beans to a medium grind (the most versatile size) and repackage them in an airtight container or sealed bag. Include a note that explains it’s ready to brew.

# 2. Gift a Manual Coffee Grinder with It

* Include an affordable, compact manual coffee grinder as part of the gift. Many manual grinders are portable, easy to use, and don’t require electricity. This way, she can grind fresh coffee beans whenever she wants. [**Example of a Manual Grinder**](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=manual+coffee+grinder&tag=gifts-favspro-20)

# 3. Check for a Local Coffee Shop

* If you’re uncertain about grinding services in her area, you could research nearby coffee shops in advance. Many cafés will grind beans for customers. Including this information in a friendly note could be a helpful gesture.

# 4. Emphasize the Specialty Aspect

* Whole bean coffee stays fresher longer than pre-ground coffee, so it’s often considered a premium way to enjoy it. If she truly loves coffee, she might appreciate the encouragement to expand her brewing experience—even if she doesn’t own a grinder yet.

# 5. Add Brewing Suggestions

* If she’s adventurous, she could try some creative brewing methods without a grinder (e.g., using a rolling pin to crush beans coarsely for a French press or similar method). Pair the coffee with a note explaining the brewing tips.

# Alternative: Switch to Nespresso-Compatible Pods

* If the idea of gifting whole bean coffee still feels inconvenient, consider switching to Nespresso-compatible coffee pods. This way, the gift aligns perfectly with her setup.

Giving the whole bean coffee can still be a lovely gift if you approach it thoughtfully. Adding a grinder, grinding the beans in advance, or even offering a coffee-related experience like brewing tips can enhance the gift's utility and charm. If you go ahead with the beans as is, you can add a warm note about the coffee’s origins or why you chose it—this personal touch will surely be appreciated!",1,1734547607.0,GiftIdeas4u,0,1.0,False

# 2. Stainless Steel French Press

* **Pros**: Durable, heat-retentive, and sleek. Some models are insulated for longer heat retention.
* **Cons**: Can’t see the brewing process and may slightly affect flavor.
* **Best For**: Those prioritizing durability and heat retention.

# 3. Ceramic French Press

* **Pros**: Great heat retention and offers a unique, artisanal look. Doesn’t impact flavor. 
* **Cons**: Fragile and heavier than other materials. 
* **Best For**: Those seeking style and better heat retention, with careful handling.

# 4. Plastic French Press

* **Pros**: Lightweight, durable, and budget-friendly.
* **Cons**: May affect the flavor and lacks aesthetic appeal.
*  **Best** **For**: Beginners or those looking for an affordable, travel-friendly option.

Since I’m single and not looking for a relationship, I flirted back, and we ended up having a long conversation over text—almost the entire night. This continued for the next two days, and eventually, he asked me to meet him since he lived nearby. I got the same vibe from him, so I agreed. 

We met for dinner, had a few drinks, danced a lot, and really connected. He had a similar vibe to mine and loved dancing, which I found appealing. After the club, we went for a ride and roamed around until late at night, around 3 a.m. At one point, he asked if we could go to his flat. I didn’t feel any creepy vibes from him, so I agreed. At his flat, we talked, listened to music, and eventually decided to sleep since he had work from home the next day. 

While sleeping, he hugged me, and due to the moment’s heat, we kissed. Before the kiss, I told him that I had never done hookups or friends-with-benefits (FWB) and wasn’t looking for sex. He respected that and said it wasn’t an issue. After the kiss, we slept. The next morning, he let me rest, brought me breakfast and coffee, and made me feel comfortable. The whole day felt romantic—he kissed me, made me laugh, and showed a lot of affection. I felt slightly attracted to him but didn’t let it show. 

For the next two days, he kept texting me, saying he missed me. I didn’t want to show much interest because, based on my past experiences, things tend to end badly when I do. However, he was persistent and asked to meet again. He even planned a small, cozy date on his balcony, which was cold and romantic. That night, after a lot of heated moments, we ended up having sex—not once, but four times. He made it clear that he’d never had sex with a condom before, but he used one because I wasn’t ready otherwise. 

Later that night, while we were lying down, he said he wanted to tell me something. He admitted that before meeting me, he was in an FWB situation with a 23-year-old girl for three months. He said she left town two days before we met, and he wanted to end things with her. However, she kept calling and texting him, crying, and threatening to harm herself, so he felt stuck. I told him to explain things to her and end it gently, considering their age gap and lack of a future together. 

We didn’t sleep that night. By morning, we went for a sunrise ride, covering 20 km, even though he had office work later. When we returned, we had sex again, and he dropped me home. 

After coming home, I started feeling conflicted. I didn’t want to be the reason someone else got hurt, so I avoided him for two days. During this time, he texted me, asking if I was on a date because I wasn’t replying. After two days, I texted back, saying I was busy, and we ended up meeting again. 

That night, he confessed that the girl had returned to town and was calling him repeatedly. I told him to talk to her. He then told me how easily he gets attached to people within 15–20 days and described himself as possessive. He was aggressive while kissing and during sex, but he made adjustments because I said I didn’t like it rough. He also said he found himself getting aroused with me more easily than ever before, even with just a kiss. I was overthinking about the other girl and whether he might be a ""f*** boy,"" but he denied it, saying he dates only one person at a time. 

Even though I tried not to, we kissed again. I told him I wouldn’t have sex with him and that this would be our last meeting because I didn’t want to continue. In the morning, he confessed that he had picked the girl up when she arrived in town at 3 a.m. This made me angry, and I sarcastically thanked him for giving me more reasons not to meet him again. He said he couldn’t deny her because it had been three months and admitted he might have feelings for her. 

I asked if he was using me as a rebound, but he denied it. I packed my things, told him this was our last meeting, and asked him to drop me home. On the way, he asked if I wanted to say anything. I said no and reminded him I had already said everything. When he dropped me off, I said goodbye and wished him luck. He asked me not to block him, and I haven’t, but now I’m overthinking everything. 

I miss him but am trying my best not to text him. ",1,1734547163.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I still try to be positive and think at least he showed me that good guys exist, guys who still call and plan dates… 

But all I really want is to have few friends, a partner,  nice job and I can’t get it. 

I go out to bar, visualize that I will meet some fiends maybe potential partner. I have bad time. I get hit on by old people my father age or older. Yes I did talk to some people but that’s all. I go to another bar or place and sometimes I don’t even talk to anyone so don’t want to go out.

Once without any planning I went to a bar because didn’t wanted to be at home, played sudoku for a drink and left. That was actually good night. Few people talk to me or tried to hit on my but they were not what I am interested in and that’s all.

I do enjoy my time at home sometimes but I would like to have few fiends to go out and get coffee or tea, to play some games and it looks like I can’t find that.

Is it because of me?,"Our beautiful girl has a severe heart disorder where her mitral valve is fused together and permanently non-functional (atresia), her aorta is small and her heart with time will become HLHS with the only solution extensive operation to turn her heart into a single ventricle heart. Each week her condition will worsen. 

We were told each operation will carry a great risk of mortality, in the double digits, and she will need 3. If successful, a single ventricle heart will at most last 35 years before the need of transplant. That is in the best case scenario, with variables far and wide in between.

Life will never be normal for her or even close to normal. She won't understand her limitations. Her countless visits for checkup, hoping and praying her condition hasn't worsened. 

We are choosing to carry the pain for her. 

Right now there are many tests being done, mainly genetic, to rule out or be aware of recurrence odds. 

My heart is broken.

My partner feels guilty, heart issues run in his family, he is certain there is a genetic cause. 

I blame myself more, even though I tried so hard to do everything perfect. I quit all my medication before getting pregnant. I never skipped my prenatal vitamins. I didn't even drink coffee, avoiding every possible risk factor. Yet - if there is no genetic cause found, environmental factors could be at play.

What are those? I asked. The answer I got is that I wouldn't be in control of them. But what? Could it have been something I ate? I craved sweet things in pregnancy and ate candy more than I should have, although I monitored my blood pressure religiously for signs of hypertension. I drank diet soda (artificial sweetner) to combat the nausea, it was all I could keep down. Were my prenatal vitamins too much?

What are environmental factors? Is there anything I could have done, anything I could avoid next time to not have this happen again.

I know it's naive to believe in karma but I do feel it's some kind of punishment for previous choices. 

A D&C is planned in the coming week. Our perfect baby girl in every way except for a ventricle that was fused together. That's all it takes.

However that's not what this post is about. It is incredibly vague about hot drinks and substances and has ended up conglomerating a lot of good, and beneficial things with the bad to the detriment of the physical and mental health of its members despite their support for those same substances. 

The reason I bring this up is the legalization of marijuana in Utah, which in no way would have happened without LDS lawyers' assistance, and the passing of the RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act) that (inadvertently?) allowed psychedelic use to be religiously available in Utah. 

The Word of Wisdom strictly prohibits the use of all drugs, yet the use of these substances has become more and more popular within Utah culture and within the church. There's now a psilocybin clinic based in Provo, UT, who the creators of have put in good assurance to me that they have provided their services to prominent leaders of the church (possible Q70, stake presidents, bishops, and members). My TBM family has utilized this as well (the only thing that held them back was the Word of Wisdom) and came out of it saying, ""Where has this form of therapy been my entire life?"" 

The church, despite still being openly against these substances as the use of these medicines is still prohibited in the WoW, has demonstrated a kind of behind-the-back support for things that are not being openly expressed to members like the up and coming medical use of marijuana and psychedelics. The church desperately needs to RELABEL what they define as ""hot drinks""- as teas and coffee and not known to be nutritional detrimentally in any way and in fact can be considered quite healthy- and what they define as ""substances""- as plant medicine is not only being legalized, but UTILIZED by church members and leaders. 

The Word of Wisdom and the substances it includes has been justified for quite a long time with leaders and members saying, ""With time we'll see how these substances are bad for us."" Well, *a lot of time has passed*, and science and research have proven that there are incredible medical benefits to things that continue to be prohibited towards members of the church who could PROFIT from the use of coffee, teas, medical marijuana, ketamine and psilocybin therapy. I am seeing cultural pushback, but the LDS church needs to become vocal about their concealed advocation for things strictly outlined as ""harmful"" in the Word of Wisdom.

Since losing weight last year, had better luck with women. This year, hooked up couple of times and went out on few dates. The twist comes from October. Met a girl in a party (talked about it here before so do check it out on my profile, not gonna repeat it)

Coming to this month, made acquaintance with a girl who was one year senior to me in school (we knew about each other through other people but had never talked). Met her again at the same place, sparks were flying all over the place. Met her the next day, and decided to go out with her (since her brother and friend were always with her and we decided to spend some time alone). Met her, great conversation. She told me that she just came out of a situation so she doesn’t wanna rush it, although she likes my presence (I did too). We sat in my car in an isolated place, talked for almost 2 hours (I wanted to kiss her but didn’t want to do anything since she wanted to take it slow). She initiated the kiss, we held hands for a while and I dropped her home. Met her the next day with her brother and friends and all was well. 
Today, she texted me that although she couldn’t stop herself, she wanted to take things slow but still be cordial and see if we can date again. I met her and told her that I do not have a lot of experience with long-termish dating so she told me her intentions. We then went out for coffee (I told her that there is no obligation but she told me she really wanted to) sat there for 1:15 hour and left (our coffee got finished in half hour but we continued talking). Dropped her at her home, gave her a super long hug which was reciprocated and she told me “do not become a stranger”

Why am I getting all the baggage? Is it too late for me stepping into the dating market? I really like her and empathise (hence, did not make a move regarding the kiss) but first the November situation now this. Is this all I’ll get if I meet other women down the line? Because it seems like everyone has dated everyone and I’m the one getting all the backlash of their bad dating or current marriage planning experiences. I feel super unlucky. Also my mindset is not about just hooking up or just being in a relationship (just going with the flow), so all these things are very heavy on me (though I’ll never throw shit on someone because of my bad experiences) I wish I got slimmer in my early 20s 😩 (PLEASE READ MY OTHER POST FOR CONTEXT)",1,1734546703.0,DatingInIndia,0,0.67,False

I’m 23F and I have a job interview this week for a receptionist/admin position at a Ballet studio. The other jobs I’ve interviewed for before this were either quite casual (coffee shop, build-a-bear at the mall) or on zoom, so I only needed to look presentable from the shoulders up. 

What is a good outfit for this kind of interview? I get the vibe that it isn’t blazer and pencil skirt, but I also know that jeans don’t usually fly. I was thinking a button-up and a long skirt, but should I go pants or khakis?

1hh7xb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1hh7xb2/travel_luxury_and_privilage/,"Travel, luxury, and privilage","I was inspired to write this post by a (now locked) vent post about travel being a luxury that only the privilaged can enjoy. I thought it was an interesting subject and was sort of bummed the post was a vent and then got locked. I wanted to say that while OP is absolutely right that travel is an economic luxury that requires a level of privilage to do, I don't think it needs to be an expensive luxury.

A luxury is any good that increases in demand out of proportion to increases in income. It's an economic category that covers basically everything except food, some utiltities, and rent. It doesn't mean fancy or elite. Tea and coffee are traditional examples of luxury goods. Travel is absolutely a luxury good/activity, but it doesn't need to be an expensive activity. One look at r/Vagabond and it's pretty obvious you don't need much money to go travel.

You also need a certain amount of privilage to travel, but often not the privilage of wealth/financial stabililty that most people picture when they think of travel. You can travel with almost no money, but you usually need to be physically and mentally healthy to do so. That's a privilage. It's also a privilage to not have debt, dependents, or similar responsibilities. I myself am pretty damn poor (I'll make around $24,000 before taxes for 2024) but have spent a good portion of the year traveling and visited half a dozen countries. But I can only do that because I'm privilaged to not have ongoing financial responsibilities, and privilaged that my job is seasonal and I can reliably pick up work.

I think the response to the original vent post about luxury and travel was extremely mixed because many people spend time traveling on extremely tight budgets, and there is a belief that most people CAN in fact afford to travel if they choose to prioritize it. To a certain extent I actually believe this, but I do recognize that my ability to choose to prioritze things is in fact a privilage that not everyone has.

I'm curious what other people have to think about traveling when you don't have a lot of money, and hopefully there can be sort of a discussion without worrying about mod action because someone violated the rules on vent posts.

There's one to two cars there every morning, blocking the bus stop while they sit inside drinking their coffee.

In the scope of things, it's not a big deal. It just really pisses me off that they're so entitled. Park in the ramp and refuse to pay, if you must. Quit blocking the bus stop!

I have never seen someone who is 30 years old before and this 30 year old guy must be a different race to what I am. I am 25 years old and I have met people who are 29, 28, 27, 26 ect but never a 30 year old. I needed to study him, and I have been following him around and watching him get coffee and talking on the phone. I followed him to where he worked and I decided to get a job there as a cleaner. 

As a cleaner I watched the 30 year old guy doing his work and I studied his life pattern. I needed to get closer to him so that I could study him. I had never seen a 30 year old man before and I needed to see what his organs looked like and whether they have any similarities between the 25 year olds and the others in their 20s. I have cut open every age group as we are of a different race, and I have found that we are all the same on the inside. The race of 20 years olds have the same organs as the race of 15 year olds and the race of  26 year olds. 

One day this guy who was from the race of 30 year olds, he was out partying, and I followed him and I watched him. I had my face covered and I attacked him when he was finally alone. I told him calmly ""I have never seen a 30 year old man before, you are a completely different race that I had never seen before. I need to know what your insides are like"" 

Just as when I was about to slice into him the man shouted ""there are other people out there who are 31, 32, 33 and even 40 and 65!"" And I couldn't believe it. I only thought that only races that were alive were between 1-29, it seems I have more to study. I decided to let the 30 year old man go and go after races of 65 year and 70 years olds. Then I will go down the races of age groups. I am really curious to see what these other races have to offer me in knowledge . 

I even heard that there are races that are 80 and 90, I wonder what their insides look like and how different or similar they will be to my race, the 25 year olds.",0,1734545654.0,shortscifistories,1,0.5,False
