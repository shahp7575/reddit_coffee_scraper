We met in the most unconventional way. Was it a just a coincidence or more? You reached out to me with a simple Hi or Hey and then it all began. We chatted non-stop for months, even late into the night when I know I should have been sleeping. Seeing messages from you brightened by day and hearing your voice made it even better! 

Originally, all of our similarities weirded me out but as time went on I actually started to like how similar we were. No one likes a warm pillow, right lol. 

Our first time meeting was like an awkward high school moment but every coffee/car date after that just got better. I knew you could never be mine but that wasn’t going to stop me from liking how you looked at me with that sparkle in your eyes, the way you made me laugh and most of all the way I felt so at ease in your presence. I hadn’t felt that in such a long time, if ever. 

Thank you for bringing so much laughter, calmness, trust, safety and joy into my life at a time when I didn't know I needed it. I enjoyed the time we spent together chatting, getting to know each other (at least I can say I got to know you lol) and having those coffee/car dates. 

I know we are no longer in contact because I just disappeared, but I had my reasons. I could have taken the high road and told you I was leaving but I didn’t think it was going to matter to you. 

I’m penning this letter hoping you’ll see it and for you to know I appreciated our time together OR to help me feel better about just walking away. Maybe both. Either way, my last words to you back in December were “is it weird that I miss you?”. Is it? 

On a side note, Congratulations to your Eagles! Did you think about me during that game since they were playing my Chiefs ❤️💛

1iqg6ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1iqg6ih/please_read_my_short_story/,Please read my short story,"**Fingertips**

    Noah Thompson was only 17, I met him the first day of freshman year. He had just moved in from Illinois and blossomed quickly into popularity. We bonded over our love for tennis, and other things like video games and Sprite Cranberry. I knew Noah was someone special just within the first moments we spoke. He knew how to keep a boring conversation going and it was clear why everyone swooned over him, me included. We were not best friends, but we hung out often enough. I mostly admired him from afar. How he spoke to people, how he was the top in his class, just the general way he carried himself, he was who I wish I could be. He was a good guy, he never put anyone down or judged people, and always wanted to help out. 
    
    
    
    “Come over this weekend. I have something I wanna show ya.” he said to me after tapping my shoulder twice. Getting me to turn and face him.  He was a bit sweaty from practice, yet still glowed as he always did. I wish I hadn't agreed. Maybe if I hadn't, this wouldn't have happened. 
    
    
    
    He owns a white car. I couldn't remember the type, just that it had an oval with a slash through it as a logo on the front of the car. Maybe a Honda or Toyota, I was never big on cars, they were like pencils to me. It doesn't matter if it's wooden or mechanical, just if it could write. I remember the day he got the car, he couldn't stop talking about it and would make any excuse to drive it around, even going as far as to offer to drive me to school everyday. After getting in the passenger seat, I threw my tennis bag on the floorboard, and settled my feet on top of it. He opened the driver's door and poked his head in. 
    
    
    
    ¨I'm going to use the bathroom before we go, I'll be right back.¨ he told me, I nodded as he closed the door. I had plenty of time to leave, to walk away, but I just pulled the seat-belt over my shoulder and clicked it to the latch. We started driving, I remember that he didn't put his seatbelt on, that he had a cold green energy drink in the cupholder and his chain bracelet kept getting snatched on the string that hung loose on the sleeve of his blue shirt. 
    
    
    
    ¨ Where are we going?¨ I asked him. He flashed me a signature smirk and looked back towards the road. 

¨There was this super cool abandoned house I thought we could hang out at. No one goes there, actually, but everyone at school has been talking about it.¨ He turned down a dirt road, the trees surrounding us.¨It's in the middle of Cimarron National Grassland.¨ 

    Cimarron National Grassland was a big forest in Kansas where we lived. I didn't go there often, but its natural life always allured tourists and locals alike. The car ride was long, but we talked alot about tennis and Noah's new girlfriend. Her name was Gemma Carson, he called her as beautiful as she was smart. That she was a goddess and he was a lowly mortal who happened to worship her. I don't do yoga, but I know a stretch when I see one. Not that she wasn't pretty, just not as beautiful as he described her. Though, to be honest, the only imperfection she really had, was that she complained all the time. Her long blonde hair complimented Noah's blue eyes. If our school did traditional yearbooks, they'd be named “Anderson County's most perfect couple.”

We got to the forest and Noah parked his car flawlessly next to some trail map we didn't intend to follow. Stepping out, I could immediately smell the earthy aroma and felt the cold air bite my skin. Noah walked around to my side of the car, I looked up to meet his eyes. His stupidly perfect eyes.

¨Ready? It's like a 20 minute walk.¨ After I nodded, he smiled and started walking ahead of me, into the forest. I should have turned away, or waited in the car, I had plenty of chances, but none of this is my fault. It's all his. 

The walk was way longer than 20 minutes. By the time we actually arrived at the abandoned house, we were beat and my feet were aching. Noah suggested that we stayed the night. I could have declined, I should have declined, maybe things would have turned out differently if I had. Noah pushed the rusty door open, his footsteps loud on the old floorboards. He chuckled as he realized how empty the place was. Only a couch and a coffee table was in the living room, the bedrooms were empty and the floor in the master bedroom was partially gone. Like someone had given up working on it halfway through. We could see the crawlspace that the house was built on, grass growing up into the wood. Yet the walls were full of paintings and pictures. None that stood out, it was just too much. Like a smile with too many teeth, or a bathroom with too many mirrors. All reflecting the same thing just from different angles.  

¨Definitely looks abandoned.¨  I remember saying while looking at one of the paintings. It was of an old woman, her hair was short and she had this melancholy look to her, but that might be me putting my own sad spin on it. The face was ripped and it looked yellow from erosion, making it hard to see altogether, the dark light that engulfed the room didn't help. It was getting late, the tip of the sun sticking out over the horizon. Not that we could see it, the trees around us covered our eyes. 

¨I bet it's haunted.” Noah said while taking a seat on the couch. Dust spawned off when his weight pressed against it. He tapped his index finger on the coffee table twice before he tilted his head back and closed his eyes, relaxing. It didn't take long for him to start snoring. The ride was pretty long, but how he can fall asleep so fast is beyond me. 

The next morning, we walked the half hour back to the car. The early sun made my eyes squint, It made my clothes seem a little more dirty, and tickled my nose to the point of sneezing. I got in the car and Noah started driving back home. It was Sunday morning so both I and his parents were at church. I was never big on religion, so I usually just stayed home on Sundays. We parked the car back at Noah's place and I quickly went in, snatching one of his hoodies. His room was clean, it always was, even when he knew he wasn't having company. He was just so effortlessly perfect. It got to be too insufferable. I jogged my way back to my place. It wasn't far, not as far as the forest was at least, and I didnt feel like making him drive me. 

I think Noah might have been mad. He hasn't answered my texts or calls. He wasn't at school the next day, either. I didn't see him in the first period where he'd shoot out the answer to a question without raising his hand, or at lunch where we normally talked about tennis. He wasn't active online, he's always active online. Posting random stuff like a ladybug on rock, titling it “Good Luck, rock!” He was always a superstitious person. I'm starting to get worried. It wasn't until 5pm when I got the expected call. 

¨Hey, Henry, have you seen Noah?̈̈” his mothers voice echoed through the phone. My heart dropped and my hands began to feel clammy. I rubbed my finger tips together to try and disturbed the sweat. She was sniffing her nose, I could hear the snot going up, only to droop back down and for her to sniffle again, she had been crying. 

¨No, not since yesterday, he wasn't at school today, either.¨ I mumbled, I knew what I was saying, what I had to say. 

“Do you know where he could have gone? No one has seen or heard from him since 9pm on Saturday.¨ His mother sounded really worried, her voice was rattling. Everyone wanted to know where Noah was. It was almost like he disappeared from the face of the earth. 

¨ Have you called the police?”

¨No, I needed to make sure you didn't know where he was first.¨  I heard her sobs. ¨Oh god Henry, where is he?¨ she was hysterical. Makes sense, Noah and his mother were pretty close, when she got sick a year ago he took a month off school to help her. They really bonded, especially after his father passed. 

¨ Call the police Mrs. Thompson.¨ I felt my hands begin to sweat more. ¨I'll call around and see what I can find out.¨ 

¨Thank you, Hon.¨ she hung up the phone. I started to dial numbers I haven't used since middle school, people who I wouldn't have ever talked to otherwise. People who were close to us, I called our entire friend group. No one had heard from him and the nervousness started to set in. I felt sick. After a few hours of holding back my vomit, my dad came into my room, his hands shaking as he patted my back. His voice had sympathy in it, but I could tell he didn't care as much as I did. He was always kind, and gave me plenty of attention, but I hated how he pitied me. 

¨ Hey kiddo, some policemen are here to talk to you. They just want to question you.¨ he told me. I nodded and headed down the stairs to the front door. I knew I'd have to talk to them at some point, but things are a lot more scary when it's actually happening, compared to it just being in your head. It's like you give yourself this power to hold back your fears when you're daydreaming. I'd have to take some kind of drug for something like that in real life.

¨Mr. Mattingly, you aren't in trouble, we just want to ask you a few questions.¨ one of the men said, the one that had the translucent ginger mustache. I nodded, I was nervous, I could feel the vomit about to skyrocket from my stomach.  I felt something empty in the corner of my body, like there was a pocket of air I needed to fill. Part of me was cold. Left out in the snow like a frozen lake, while the other was hot, boiling like a tea kettle turning black on the bottom. ¨When was the last time you saw Noah Thompson?¨

¨Sunday morning. After we came home from a hike in the woods.¨ I said, holding back my shaky voice the best I could. Something I've never been good at. Like when I broke my neighbor's window as a kid, I tried to lie and blame it on a cat. They knew it was me and I got grounded. I wasn't allowed to throw stuff outside again unless it was an open field. Like at my grandma's house. Before she died she had a lot of land that me and the neighborhood kids would play on. 

¨Did Noah ever talk about running away or depression?¨ One of the officers asked. My mother started to cry, she stood not too far behind me, cradled in my fathers arms. She was close with Noah's mom, they had been friends for a while. Even hosting Noah's 16th and 17th birthday parties. Quite the shock when she called this morning. 

¨No, never. He was genuinely pretty happy.¨ I said truthfully. It was hard to see the officer's face as my eyes fogged up with tears, I looked down to hide them ¨Please, find him¨ I mumbled. 

¨We are doing the best we can. Just one more question. Do you know anyone who could have wanted to hurt Noah?̈” The ginger officer asked. The man behind him was writing stuff down on a small notebook. I can't imagine what he could possibly be jotting down, everything I said they already knew. I guarantee his mom answered these questions the same as I have. 

¨No, I mean, no one seemed particularly keen on hurting him. He didn't have any enemies.¨ I answered. My father patted my shoulder, as if telling me to go back to my room while the officers talked to him. 

Over the span of two days the police questioned all our friends, Gemma, and Noah's mom but they couldn't gather any leads. They went through and searched his room, there was no sign of struggle, no note about running away, no clear indication about anyone who was out to get him. It was scary how he was here one second, talking and posting online and then gone the next. My parents let me stay home from school for a few days to gather my thoughts. I remembered calling his number repeatedly, texting, trying desperately to get ahold of him. Part of me knew he wouldn't pick up, the part of me that felt icy. 

After a few more days of searching with no leads the police asked for volunteers to help them. Me, along with my parents and friends joined the search to find him, Gemma stayed stuck to me, like a fly on honey. Asking me questions about where I had last seen him, she was already complaining about her feet hurting. Our group, armed with flashlights, became a diligent search team, it was getting exhausting. We searched for days with no signs of him or his body. His mom looked both numb and hysterical, we all were, but she was sobbing, the chances that he's still alive is low, he's been missing for over 24 hours now. She had just lost the only person who had really mattered to her, the only person who took care of her, him and her husband now gone. There was no trace of where he was or even if he was alive. There were no suspects and no witnesses, which led to no leads. 

The police and the volunteers searched for him for about another month, they did everything they could. They hung flyers, posted him on social media, and still he wasn't found. The police eventually closed the case. Everyone was devastated. I remember attending his memorial, seeing his smiling photo and the roses placed around his empty casket. Even in death he was perfect, the sky was clear, the flowers and colors mixed well. Mrs. Thompson asked me to send her photos of Noah, looking back at all our memories just drove the point home. It allowed the guilt to linger, like a bad smell. 

I was off the hook. Once the police gave up on the case I knew I had gotten away with killing Noah. I felt bad about it at first, but once I had that knife in my hand and we were alone, I knew I couldn't control myself. I knew I should have turned back, to leave, but deep down, I think a part of me really just wanted to see the perfect life drain from his perfect eyes. It was his fault, for always showing off the way he did. Proving that his life was better than mine, then everyones. I bet he got a kick out of looking down at people, people like me who couldn't afford brand new cars or effortless charm and talent.  It was ridiculous how he always got his fucking way, i wanted to be the one to show that spoiled brat what it was like to be dead inside. 

I'm currently 25, no one but me and Noah knows what happened that night at the abandoned house. Only I know that his body is buried in the master bedroom where the floor had been partially removed. Only I know how I had put sleeping pills in his green energy drink. Only I know how the blood stained my clothes, only I know how I meticulously parked his car at his house that Sunday morning. How I stole one of his hoodies to cover the blood. How I started a rumor about an abandoned house in the national grassland. Only I know the way he gasped for air as I watched his blood drain out. How he reached out to me, betrayal in his eyes. How I called his phone so often, attended the search parties, consoled his mom, just to further the narrative of a sad boy who had just lost his friend. The only thing I didn't fake was the lump in my throat when I was questioned. It was a lot easier to imagine it, then actually experience it. But I disguised the nervousness as sadness pretty well. So I guess the reason I'm writing this is so I can finally stop hearing his stupid, 17 year old voice in the back of my head.

After 40+ years of struggling with depression and ADHD, I have a bunch of anecdotally effective food supplements and herbs to keep my brain mostly functional (mostly) (and also my doctor’s office finally gave me a mental health questionnaire and went “waiiiiit….” and got me actual meds, so like. Don’t stop those until and unless you have to.)

These are all YMMV, but may help in the coming years.

Depression:
1. Biotin. Why does this work? Fuck if I know, but when I switched to prenatal vitamins from my regular routine, my depression had a field day. Looking at all of the vitamins included in both the prenatal and my regular routine, biotin was the only thing missing from the prenatal. I went back to my regular routine and my depression stepped back again. (Note that this was in combination with a super B-complex vitamin).
2. St. John’s wort. This does help, and is generally easy to get as a tea, the plants are also very pretty. Same effect as SSRI’s, and you should be careful using it in conjunction with actual SSRI’s.
3. Vitamin D and Taurine. If you get Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), this can be a helpful combo. The Taurine helps your body process the vitamin D.

Anxiety:
1. Valerian root. Smells like feet, but I’ve found it very helpful to reduce anxiety. You can get the roots bulk, or they are stupidly easy to grow. Like, I gave up gardening and they still lasted a few years after that.
2. Skullcap (Scutellaria lateriflora specifically). I find this relaxes me and helps me focus. Native to NA, have not tried growing it (yet). Using too much can give you the jitters, very similar to coffee.
3. Kava kava. This one is pretty well known, but sadly, not easy to grow yourself. I’m planning to stockpile some.

ADHD - this list of alternatives is shakier than the others. Your normal medication is still going to be best, but ya know.
1. Lions mane mushroom. I get mine in a mushroom combo supplement. I think it’s helped? I believe you can get grow kits for them.
2. Ashwagandha. I started this at the same time as the mushroom combo. Combined they did seem to help. I’m going to start trying to grow it at home.

General:
1. Damiana. I use this to help me sleep. Hard to find plants, planning to buy one soon. Apparently it can make your dreams very vivid, so if you generally get nightmares you might want to avoid this one.
2. Passionflower. A lot of people recommend this for help with anxiety and sleep. It makes my ligaments and tendons forget to do their jobs though, so I sprain more easily and my joints hurt when I use it.
3. Asafoetida, aka hing, aka devil’s dung. Should noooot be taken while pregnant, as it can trigger uterine contractions. I’m planning to grow this soon as well. An interesting spice that tastes better than it smells.
4. Melatonin. Easy to get, used to help sleep. I always found it to trigger my periods, so don’t take massive doses when pregnant.

All of this was researched years ago or not particularly thoroughly (and I don’t currently have time to fix that), so I recommend doing some research of your own first. But I hope this helps some of us",3,1739666812.0,TwoXPreppers,0,0.8,False

For example, imagine doing a cheating roleplay with characters from Khabhi Khushi Khabhi Gham. The slutty Pooh (Kareena Kapoor) constantly pushing her limits, always small satin robes or sheer robes and nothing else, the ends of the robe stopping at her mid-thigh, the loosely tied belt the only thing protecting her from flashing. Even though her exposed waist and cleavage told a story of their own, her nipples barely hidden and did slip out every few seconds.

Or Andhadhun, When Simi had to test if Akash was really blind she came to his house to investigate and while he was making coffee, she pulled out her massive breasts in the kitchen to see what visible reaction he would have or maybe down in his pants?

or how about a in-universe sequel to Humraaz?

Following the steps of other successful choreographers before him (Farah Khan, Prabhu Deva, Ganesh Acharya, etc) - now Omi has plans to turn into a director and take the responsibility for an entire film.

Raj Singhania (41) has occasionally financed a few films done by his friends. So he is known in the producers-directors circle. One of Omi’s acquaintances helps in setting up a meeting between Omi and Raj. The men meet.

Omi tells Raj, that he wants to make a movie about a married woman, without her knowledge. The woman will be someone who has a dancing background, but has been away from the dancing world for years. Raj is intrigued by the idea, and decides to fund this movie. And asks him, whom Omi wanna cast in the movie.

Omi drops a bomb, and shows Raj a short film. It’s shot with hidden camera, and features Priya (36) - Raj’s wife. It’s a film where Priya is dancing in a wedding baraat, and bumps into Omi. The two dance happily. Raj is pretty impressed with the way, Omi has used the camera, edit and music. And also, he likes the idea of his wife returning to something dance/entertainment related field. He gives green signal.

Omi and his brother Karan had a ten year age gap, so after their parents death - Karan had practically been like a parent to him. Omi as a ten year old, was pretty fond of Priya (who back then, was his Bhaiya’s girlfriend). Omi used to constantly day dream about living a perfect life with Karan and Priya. Until one day - everything was over!

As he grew up in this harsh world, he found what had happened to his brother. And how Priya was now living a luxurious life. He would often feel his brother inside his mind, and would want to take Priya for himself. In his head, that would unite Priya and Karan. He started learning to dance, his brother’s old videos and memories helped him a lot. And the hatred for Priya and Raj just fuelled his passion.

Meanwhile Raj Singhania is going through a crisis. He has been not able to get his rod hard for any woman since years now. He loves his wife truly, and he knows that she loves him too. But the lack of sex is eating him up. There was no excitement or color in his life. Until Omi walked into his office with that short film…

When Raj saw Omi (a young guy) dancing with his wife. He felt a current flowing through his body. He felt hard for the first time in years. He saw how Omi’s hands had brushed against the naked skin of Priya’s back and waist. How her giant melons had crushed on Omi’s chest a couple of times. He wanted more…

1iqg515,https://www.reddit.com/r/Atkins/comments/1iqg515/updates_in_the_past_30_years/,Updates in the Past 30 Years?,"I did Atkins long ago, maybe close to 30 years ago, and was successful in losing weight. I think I lost about 25 to 30 lbs. Unfortunately I kind of fell off the bandwagon and have been gradually gaining weight over the years, although looking at it being 30 years, maybe I haven't done too badly, but regardless, I need to lose some. 

As many readers will know, there are several approaches to low-carb diets in today's world. I've been comparing Carnivore and Keto to Atkins, and while they share a number of similarities, one of the things I've always thought set Atkins apart from almost all other diet programs -- low-carb or otherwise -- is there is actually an exit plan from Atkins: you gradually add carbs into your diet until the point at which the carbs you're taking in is what you are burning, and that's where you stay. I don't see anything along those lines in either Carnivore or Keto, so I plan to go back to Atkins. Sadly (in my opinion) the Atkins web site has become a sales tool for all the protein shakes, low-carb snacks, etc., with very little information about the diet itself.

Anyway, I noticed in the book realm, there are several books titled ""New"" Atkins, and I'm wondering what has changed in the 30 years since I last really paid attention to Atkins. For example, I remember the plan called for small dinner salads with basically just lettuce and oil and vinegar ""dressing"". Is that still part of the program? 

I don't recall much about beverages, other than no alcohol, at least during induction phase. Obviously water is fine, but I think it used to be that diet sodas were considered OK, although I've pretty much stopped drinking soda altogether now, but I do generally consume VitaRain drinks at a rate of about one bottle every day. The nutrition label says 0 carbs, so at this point I can't see any reason I'd need to give those up. Coffee would seem to be fine, with cream instead of milk, and I would imagine unsweetened ice tea should be fine as well. 

Can't think of anything else right now, but feel free to jump in if there's something you know to be different. I'm getting ready to head to the grocery to stock up. Will probably need second mortgage for eggs....",1,1739666709.0,Atkins,0,1.0,False

As one might expect of a coffee enthusiast like those of us in this sub, that means I try a lot of different coffee. Everyone knows about the popular Tokyo spots by now (Glitch, Leaves, etc), but I’m going to share a couple good spots in Yokohama that I really enjoy. For those who don’t know much about Japan, Yokohama is just south of Tokyo and is only about a 25 minute train ride from Tokyo Station to Yokohama Station (if you get on the limited express train).

Since Yokohama has less tourists in general than Tokyo, these places are smaller and less busy. But their coffee is delicious, and I actually prefer them to the Glitch that I’ve had previously.

1. Minato Coffee - https://minatocoffee.gorp.jp

This place is the easiest to get to. It’s a small hut and is located right outside Minatomirai Station, in between the Landmark Tower and Queen’s Square buildings. The workers there are super friendly, always smiling, and seem to be having a bunch of fun. They have a lot of beans to choose from, but being a specialty coffee shop, the beans will tend to be light roast and “fun”. I’ve recently had some geisha, some pink bourbon, and some anaerobics there that were genuinely delicious.

2. Tsukikoya - http://tsukikoya.com/shop2/

Located right at the entrance to Chinatown in Yokohama, across the street from the Motomachi shopping area. This shop makes some of my favorite coffee that I’ve ever had. The barista working there really knows his stuff. They have a lot of beans to choose from and he will work with you to find what sort of flavor you want to have and provide recommendations based on your taste. He even offers some cuppings first so you can see if you’ll like it before ordering. Truly fantastic. Highly recommended.

3. Ura - https://www.instagram.com/coffeeandbakedura/

This shop is super local. It isn’t in a touristy location or near any big shopping destinations. It’s very local and is a few stops away from Yokohama Station (the station nearest is Higashi-Hakuraku). The owner has won the Japan Hand Drip Championship and his skills are very apparent. This shop was actually recommended to me by the baristas at Minato Coffee that I mentioned above. The owner and his wife roast the beans in house and also make some baked treats as well. During my recent stay in Japan, this cafe made an incredible cup of coffee using some beans from Thailand. There really isn’t anything else to do in this immediate area, but it’s worth going a couple stops away from Yokohama for a good lunch time cup.",1,1739666634.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

2024 I lost my dog, my uncle, my aunt, my appendix bursted had surgery, my wedding got cancelled and found out that my dad is terminal with stage 4 cancer and had to look after him. Saw so much blood, been to hospitals so many times, just too many funerals. 

I started to have panic attacks, then GAD came back and also got diagnosed with major depression. I was shaking, shivering, jitters, morning anxiety, was on alert mode 24/7, was thinking and feeling like dying all the time, was on the verge of screaming and saying that something bad was about to happen, was feeling like I was about to lose my mind, was feeling like I was falling down from the stairs when I closed my eyes, was having sensations I was unable to identify, was dizzy all the time and came to a point where I did not even want to turn the lights of and leave my room. I was so worried that my brain was never going to be able to function the same. My hands were sweaty all the time and I was unable to work since it was like death chasing me 24/7.


I tried not to use pills for 9 months and did therapy , but I finally gave up and now on paxil/paroxetine SSRI for the past 5 weeks. 


I sometimes have panic attacks, but I no longer have any physical sensations that triggers it.Currently it is more like feeling like I am actually dying and I can not think about anything else or feeling this dread in me. I feel confused and do not know how to feel and I feel sedated. But it is not that bad without the physical sensations. I started to leave the house and I can now work at a coffee shop. It is just the feeling/thought that I am dying is still there…. Is 5 weeks on pills too early? Am I permanently damaged? I just need hope…
Is there anyone whose cognitive symptoms or thoughts are stronger than the physical symptoms?

This diagnosis has made me really reflect on my physical and psychological patterns so im curious to see what you guys can relate to:   
  
• constantly snacking, or hyperfixating on a project and not eating the entire day until your stomach is literally screaming at you   
  
• also, eating the same thing every single day and when it stops tasting good you don’t really have an appetite until the next big thing   
  
• overly aware of how your clothes fit on your body - if i overindulge in carbs and get water retention, i can sense the difference in how my clothes fit the next day. Can’t wear certain fabrics and low rise jeans are honestly my best friend. 
  
• anxiety during text conversations because you feel like the person is waiting on your response (not sure if im articulating this quite right)   
  
• this has been mentioned before but getting “sleepy” or brain fog when starting a task you don’t find stimulating   
  
• doing a thousand things as procrastination before doing the “one big thing”   
  
• constant lists and screenshots in your phone from random online rabbit holes    
  
• knowing a lot about random subjects but not enough to be an expert.    
  
• thinking about your response during conversation but then forgetting it, and by the time the other person finishes their sentence you kinda forget what to say lol   
  
• or the reverse, where you interrupt your own sentences as you jump from thought to thought in conversation   
  
• having to wake up super early to get ready because a streamlined morning routine is absolutely impossible     
  
• oral fixations - vaping, gum, picking at your lips, chapstick   
  
• changing outfits constantly because you can’t decide what to wear   
    
• drinking four different kinds of liquids (tea, diet soda, water and coffee on my desk at all times)

So I have a weird concern, I just finished my first week of ADF, I find I end up fasting 38h then normal eating of lunch and dinner, and often a late night snack. So fast starts at 10pm and I eat lunch at around 12pm  38h later.

Only thing I'm having on fasting days is 1 cup of black coffee sipped slowly throughout the entire day.

After first no eat day i lost 1lb(weighing myself before food intake) I thought this is awesome, I've finally found something that works for me.

After second no eat day I lost 6lb, I'm thinking ok weird, just water I assume but I'm sure I drank lots.

Now when I weighed myself today after the 3rd no eat day I've lost 6lbs again.

So I'm down a total of 13lbs since the before times. In under a week.

Is this something I should be concerned about? Iv been doing my normal physical activity on fasting and non fasting days and havnt noticed any less energy, if anything I've had an increase in energy on eating days.

Some history on my habits, I'm quite muscular i can easily do 40 push-ups in a row and 5 or 6 Chinups(remember I'm over 300lb)

2 years ago I lost 80lb by doing a lot of walking(10k minimum per day) and limiting calorie intake to 1200 a day.(but often hitting 1500) since then iv maintained 290 until over this past winter when I let it get back up to 312lb. Once I saw it hit 312 at the end of January I started doing 1.5h of cardio a day and a 5k walk and limited calorie intake back down to 1200(once again 2 or 3 days a week hitting 1500) getting to when I started ADF at 308.

So in a week of ADF I've lost 13lbs and 5 weeks of heavy diet and excercise I lost 4lb. The 4lb seems correct to me, I'm concerned about the quick losses of ADF.",1,1739664899.0,AlternateDayFasting,1,0.67,False

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you feeling tired and drained? If you’re following a vegan diet, one possible reason could be a lack of iron. Iron is essential for transporting oxygen in your blood, and when your body isn’t getting enough, fatigue can set in. The good news is that many delicious and nutritious vegan foods are rich in iron and can help you boost your energy levels.

### Why Iron Matters

Iron is vital for overall health. It plays a key role in producing hemoglobin, which is the protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen to your body’s tissues. Without sufficient iron, you may experience symptoms such as weakness, lethargy, and even headaches. For vegans, it’s crucial to incorporate iron-rich foods because the iron found in plant-based sources is non-heme iron, which is not absorbed as efficiently as the heme iron in animal products. Therefore, combining these foods with vitamin C sources can enhance absorption.

### 10 Iron-Rich Vegan Foods to Energize Your Day

- **Lentils:** A powerhouse of nutrition, lentils offer about 6.6 mg of iron per cooked cup. They are versatile and can be added to soups, salads, or even made into lentil burgers.
- **Chickpeas:** With around 4.7 mg of iron per cooked cup, chickpeas can be your energy-boosting friend. You can enjoy them in hummus, salads, or stews.
- **Tofu:** Tofu is a great source of iron, providing about 3.4 mg per half-cup serving. Use it in stir-fries, soups, or grilled for a tasty meal.
- **Quinoa:** This ancient grain is not just a complete protein but also packs 2.8 mg of iron per cooked cup. Use quinoa as a base for salads or as a side dish.
- **Spinach:** Dark leafy greens like spinach are rich in iron. A cup of cooked spinach gives you around 6.4 mg of iron. Toss it in salads, smoothies, or omelets.
- **Pumpkin Seeds:** These tiny seeds aren’t just a snack; they provide around 2.5 mg of iron per ounce. Sprinkle them on salads, or eat them roasted for a crunchy treat.
- **Blackstrap Molasses:** This syrup delivers about 3.5 mg of iron per tablespoon. Add it to smoothies, oatmeal, or baked goods for extra sweetness and nutrients.
- **Dried Fruits:** Dried apricots and raisins are easy and delicious ways to boost your iron intake. A quarter-cup of dried apricots has around 0.6 mg of iron.
- **Fortified Cereals:** Many breakfast cereals are fortified with iron, sometimes providing up to 18 mg per serving. Check the label to find a vegan option that works for you.
- **Broccoli:** Aside from being a powerhouse of vitamins, a cup of broccoli provides 1 mg of iron. Incorporate it into stir-fries, salads, or steam it as a side.

### Tips for Increasing Iron Absorption

Just eating iron-rich foods isn't enough. Improving absorption is key to combating fatigue effectively. Here are some tips you should consider:

- **Pair with Vitamin C:** Combine iron-rich foods with sources of vitamin C, like oranges, strawberries, or bell peppers. This pairing can increase iron absorption significantly.
- **Avoid Certain Beverages:** Limit tea or coffee around meal times. Tannins in these beverages can hinder iron absorption.
- **Include Fermented Foods:** Foods like kimchi and sauerkraut can boost gut health and may help with nutrient absorption.

Adding these iron-rich vegan foods to your meals can help you fight fatigue and boost your energy levels. By consuming a diverse range of ingredients, you can ensure that you’re not only meeting your iron needs but also enjoying a flavorful and vibrant diet. Start incorporating these foods into your daily meals, and watch as your energy levels improve!

### 3. Legume-loaded Lunch Salads

Salads can be much more than just greens. Add **lentils** or **black beans** to your salad for iron power. Toss in colorful veggies such as bell peppers, carrots, and tomatoes. A sprinkle of seeds like pumpkin or sesame can add crunch and extra iron!

### 4. Iron-rich Wraps

Wraps make for a great portable lunch. Use a whole-wheat or spinach tortilla and fill it with a spread of **hummus**. Then layer in roasted red peppers, spinach, and some shredded carrots. For an additional protein and iron boost, add grilled tofu or tempeh.

### 5. Iron-infused Soups and Stews

Soups and stews are perfect for including iron-rich ingredients. Make a hearty **kale and white bean stew** or a spicy **chili** with kidney beans and black beans. These meals are great for meal prep and can be frozen for a quick dinner option later in the week.

### 8. Delicious Desserts

### 9. Baking for Health

**Background:**

* **3 years ago** – Had to give up gluten after switching probiotics. Took me almost two months to realize gluten was causing constipation (1-2 days) and constant bloating.
* **2 years ago** – Symptoms returned, so my doctor recommended a low FODMAP diet.
* **1 year ago** – Started experiencing weekly constipation, brain fog, and intense sugar cravings. Despite 2 months of stool tests, parasite tests, blood tests, etc., nothing showed up.
* **6 months ago** – Saw a naturopath who had me avoid raw fruits, vegetables, red meat, eggs, dairy, soy, etc., and start drinking celery juice every morning. Huge improvement. While reintroducing foods, I realized eggs were causing headaches and constipation.
* **4 months ago** – Stopped drinking coffee (switched to caffeine pills).
* **2 months ago** – Still fatigued, no gym progress, low energy. Started digestive enzymes, and my BMs went from 2-3 times a day to 15+ times a day. Went back to my doctor, updated him on my naturopath/food experiences, and he referred me to a gastro. The digestive enzyme thing was the most puzzling but it got me thinking that maybe I have low enzyme production or malabsorption causing SIBO (undigested foods just sits and ferments).

**Recent Gastro Visit & SIBO Test**

* Got a colonoscopy and gastro exam—both came back negative.
* Gastro suggested I get tested for SIBO & lactose intolerance.
* Continued low FODMAP, celery juice before breakfast, and stopped digestive enzymes.
* Just got my SIBO results—negative for all three types, but the lab mentioned possible hydrogen sulfide SIBO (intestinal sulfide overproduction)

**Now What?**

I hadn’t even heard of SIBO a month ago, and now my results mention sulfide overproduction. From what I’ve read, the typical treatment seems to be Rifaximin.

Has anyone here dealt with hydrogen sulfide SIBO? What worked for you? Any alternative treatments besides antibiotics?

I 24 (F) and Robert  22 (M) have been together for 4 yrs, unfortunately, I had multiple emergency eye surgeries which made me have to pay $10,500 in deductible and $3,000 for college tuition (we are both students I am doing my masters in psychology and he is soon to be marine biologist) making us lose our apartment and having to live with his parents.

A bit of back story we are Latinos (Is important to know) I am unfortunately not on the skinny side, I am not too big but I am big, the day before I met his mom he had told me that his mom did not like his first gf because she was to shy to speak. I was like bet I am also shy but it can go either way talk a lot or less. When I entered the house she paused and went in a for a hug and then said Robert (fake name) always like his girls on the big side. Take note he is skinny but a bit built but his whole family are skinny.Ever since then they feel entitled to speak about anything that I eat (even when I am a picky eater) and about my body.  Robert has a sister who is disabled, she cant speak, see, walk, or move much.

Now onto the current situation, his parents knew of our situation and one day while we were visiting they stated that we can stay in their house till we get up on our feet and it would be free of charge but to just clean around the house, take care of his sister and save money. We and Robert were peachless and ngl we felt like failures. On that day we cried together because at the moment we had no choice we didn't had money to buy groceries,  pay the rent, or light bill. I told him that we could get part-time jobs or I can take extra shifts so that we can stay here and not intrude in their space. After a week we decided on taking the offer. I warned him that I have been through this before when I was younger and I will get depressed and this might affect our relationship. There is a saying in Spanish that after 3 days the dead stinks is said when you stay at someone else's house for too long.  I gave ourselves 6 months to leave.

We moved around November 2024 and everything was fine for the first week I decided to get therapy because I knew what was going to happen. After the first week, I could tell that we were beginning to be a problem. His mom would comment on anything I would do and eat. I was ignoring her comments, and decided to not say it to my partner. I don't want things to be awkward between me and hi because of his mom. in the 3rd week step dad asked to speak with him directly and ask for rent money, and Robert agreed without speaking to me first. Why would they change their mind not even a month in, I was buying our own food and cooking our own food because IK they would've complain eventually if I were to take their food, even if they offered. Robert came to me irritated, I was like fine then we will pay but it will make it harder on us with saving since I was planing on paying all of my medical bills quicker. we both had to give $350 yes it might be a lot for some people but working in minimum wage is a lot when you barely make $900 biweekly.

I thought maybe they were using to pay some of the bills like water and electricity but from my experience renting and having to pay both I knew we didn't waste more than 400 since we are barely home due to work and school. but I let it slide. Every day would be tiny remarks. Around mid-December Robert approached me and said that he thinks that we are bothering them, even when we are staying in the basement all day only going up to shower and cook. I told him everything that has been happening to me while being there he told me to hold on a bit longer and that we would soon be out. Around that time some kids tried to break into his car breaking the window and ignition, understandably we were upset as we only had 1 car, and chrismas was around the corner and would have a hard time paying the repairs, but we were trying to figure out how to handle the situation within ourselves. But I guess we arent able to get upset his mom stormed downstairs to the basement mad saying to control his emotions, that she has lost more than him, to man up and deal with everything and stop complaining. that we can use his step dads truck, after that she left upstairs. We didn't want to bother them and were going to take public transportation, but they still insisted.

I had gotten sick around this time and since they are very cautious do to his sister getting sick so fast and badly.  I decided to use a mask, wear gloves, cook our meal and I ate it in the basement. Apparently they also have a issue with me wanting to eat snacks, or anything downstairs. and brought it up to Robert they have had other issues with me where they have brought it up to Robert not me which Irritates me because his explanation to why I did something is not true (like me being tired) to keep the peace.

Starting January we were able to pay the car repairs and get our car back, and just like almost everyone we decided to go to the gym ($10 monthly), Robert has gained a bit of weight due to the holidays and his mom has made comments that made him feel bad about himself. I encouraged him to go with his friend as I feel very uncomfortable to go in the gym, I told him I would do them in the basement. We had notified them that he would be leaving the house at 4:30am to go out she had agreed that it is fine. Not 5 min after we let her know that she speed walks to us and talks in a loud tone ""oh you cant do that, there will be a big storm tomorrow, that you will need to move the car behind the truck so that step dad doesn't have to move yours, and you need to take a shower after we are done with the bathroom"" Robert stood silent, so I spoke, yes we know we have to do that we already agreed to do that, as for the winter storm we were not aware but that's fine we can start another day.

The day after the winter storm he left to the gym, I did my exercise, and took a shower very early as to not interrupt their morning routine. The only thing I did was go upstairs at 6:10 am to put eggs to boil I asked Pat (roberts mom) if she wanted some she said yes just 1. I put the eggs to boil and left downstairs. at 6:20 am Robert arrived I went to check on the eggs I told Robert they were not done that we will need to wait a bit before we eat. we both head downstairs again to get out of their way, he notice they were done with the bathroom and went to take a shower ( I was still in the basement) At 6:50 we both head to the kitchen upstairs and I start to serve him his coffee, eggs and crakers.

I notice the tension in the air, and as soon as his step dad left at 7am she started to yell at us that we cant be up there at 6am interrupting her routine at feeding his sister that it cause her distress. Robert stayed silent I was already tired at her shit talking and told her that all I did was BOIL AN EGG. I matched her energy since she doesn't let anyone talk. Then said to next time just come up at 7 and cook and eat. I told her fine ill do prep breakfast meals and eat them at work because we wont be able to cook and eat and be at work on time. She then said to not be mad at her that she just needs her space and we were taking it at 6am. I told her again I was boiling an egg an left while it boiled giving her space. but fine if she wants her space she will have it, we will have our prep means and eat them at work.

She left the kitchen to keep attending his sister and we left for work. While at work at 3p m I got a text her saying "" I want to apologize for what happened In the morning. sorry if I made u feel bad, believe me it wasn't my intention. my morning are very busy, but know  didn't want to offend u. again I'm sorry u are a good human being and I have grown fond of you""  I did not answer to the text I also did not left her on read, I went home and decided to approach it face to face since I believe it has to be done like that not by text.

she was in her craft room, I entered the room and she instantly went in for a hug asking for forgiveness, I patted her and told her ""let me talk to you and then you can decide whether you want the hug"" she told me again sorry you left mad and bla bla bla same thing don't he text. I told her I did not left mad she interrupts me ""yes u did"" I was like no. Believe me it takes forever to make me mad since I was raised with 6 siblings I have lots of patience. I told her that her outbursts could have been avoided if she told me when I went upstairs that I would understand. but she decided to be irritated and talk shit to the step dad cuz I heard it and then proceed to make a scene. that I will respect her wishes and not go upstairs till 7am to just drink coffee (which I don't Robert does) because we have to be out by 7:15 to go to work at a different city. but that this isn't the first time she had her outbursts that she has been coming at us since November but both me and Robert were staying silent. she continued to deny and then start crying telling me that Robert left without saying bye to his sister. I told her u were in there and u made an ouburts and to give you the space you asked we left to keep ""interrupting you.""

She then proceeded to not take accountability and keep blaming robert for everything that ""he has me in the basement"", I responded that we both agreed on their arrangement that it isn't his fault. she then again blaming him that ""he should listen to her and save money to buy a house"" I told her is being taken care of we have been able to speak to some people and are on the verge. she got offended and asked when that we haven't told her anything. I told her that we don't have to tell her our every move and that we just started, that Robert can tell her when he was ready. I explained how uncomfortable we feel because they get annoyed by us just breathing an I get it we are all adut with out own habits that will clash but don't wait to make a scene and just say what bothers you and we can talk it out or work around it. at the end I thought all was fine I headed to the basement to take off my work clothes before I start to cook and told Robert of everything that we talked about. After we both head upstairs she called him in separately in which again she proceeded to blame him and play victim, and not take accountability but Robert stayed silent the whole time and left after she was done, and she kept crying.

We both know that at any moment his step dad will pull him aside and try to intimidate him because his mom felt some type of way. So I told Robert that if they start speaking of anything regarding that day or about us that he should include me, because why would they bring me if I'm not there to speak for myself. he agreed and although she hasn't pulled him aside some shit has happened in between January and feb with his mom and me where I had to defend myself because she wants to make decision for me when I am capable enough to make my own decision.  through November till now we had some issues and even Robert has notice a change in my character, but I keep telling him that I warned him. that I have yet to have a break down because I have to play strong person, but once we are out I will crumble,

The other day she mentioned something about a joined account for us to make. she said for Robert to go to the bank and do that for us. I was like ok when did ""we"" speak about this cuz we had agreed yrs ago that we would do this once we buy a house. he said that since I was going to sign papers to be the pca for his sister that the money would go there. I was confused because I had agreed to it but I told her that I would be putting the money in my savings account so that we can use it for anything. around that time I was going into work at 7am and leaving early due to a project at work, Robert was able to match my schedule for the 2 weeks. on the last day she asked me if I was still going to leave at 4pm I told her no why?

and the conversation about the joined account came to be. I asked her that I was wondering why she brought that up with Robert cuz I never spoke about doing such thing that we had agreed to do that for another thing, and that the money would be going to my personal bank instead. she then pulled an excuse out of her ass and said that his car was fuming this morning (they moved it without waiting for it to warm up In the middle of winter) but I asked what does that have to do with this. then she said ""oh is so that you guys can use the money for emergency"" I told her that thanks to them we were able to save money for that and if Robert struggles I can pay the rest. she then said "" it has to be a bank"" I responded I have a bank it can go there. mind you she was yelling and talking with attitude and I just raised my voice since she wants to do that she gave up and said fine use ur bank.

to finish this I decided some time with Robert that I would not be able to take care of his sister and wont be signing any papers because I will not only have to work, but school and internship and will not have time to care for her or my own little sister.

his mom called him yesterday (2/14) at lunch and for some reason, the conversation about joining our bank account came up again and paying for his classes and when will I sign and he said that I decided that I wont do that but he did not went into detail. she started to blab about random shit and Robert said that it is a conversation that I should be in and we can talk at home. what proceeded to go through her lips was ""oh Isee how it is""  she took offence to what he said and tried to play victim again and guilt-trip him he ended the call.

so reddit again I apologize for big post but aita for not taking care of my bf sister.",2,1739664379.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Sorry to be a downer. Going through the absolute worst time of my life. Ex(33M) broke up with me(36F) over 9 months ago (we have broken NC several times in between) and I seriously cannot move on. Together almost 2 years. I have tried everything from therapy, medication, hobbies, exercise, going out more, meet new people, dating. Absolutely nothing is helping. We met up 3 weeks ago for coffee, it ended badly with him telling me he has long moved on and implying he’s been in multiple relationships since the breakup etc and even subtly bragged about it to me. 

I have been pretty much in bed ever since our meeting. I feel like I am giving up on my life. I have dated so many people in this city throughout the past 11 years I’ve lived here that I truly do not see myself ever going through this over and over again. I gave that relationship everything I had. I have nothing left. I am so tired of fighting for men to love me. Please be kind, I’m suffering a lot and I am neurodivergent with some BPD traits. 

Thinking the psych ward is my last resort. Any recommendations in the city or upstate? Happy to hear other alternatives as well.

All help welcomed!,"I'm going to try to keep this as short and ""just the facts"" as possible but I tend to be wordy.  I've been lurking around here for a bit as well as another message board (FB) to learn as much as possible and to hear of so many experiences with this.  

Female in the U.S., soon to turn 65.  My Medicare starts on March 1 just before my birthday on the 7th.  Type 2 diabetic, many years ignored, currently ""ok"" managed, last A1C was 7.8 (two years ago I pulled a 12.8).  Ranges 7.2 - 8.4 since focusing.  20 units Basaglar long acting insulin daily and glipizide 1x/day for diabetes.  Had a run with Trulicity but not currently.   Graves disease diagnosed in 2008, thyroid irradiated and take Levothyroxine.  Lisiniprol for well managed blood pressure.  Obese with BMI of 36 (I'd like to lose about 50 lbs.... not skinny but a nice size for my height).

For months I've felt ""sickly"" and had some urgent diarrhea.  I didn't think too much about it because I've had IBS-D for over 35 years so I know the drill.  In early January, I began having regular liquid diarrhea, it was yellow and with, no warning.  Sometimes right after eating, sometimes hours later, always seems worse in the morning.  Often daily incontinence despite being just 10' or so from my bathroom.  Gassy and bloated.  Horrible smell like sewer gas.  Fatigue, lack of much appetite, figured it was because I was afraid to eat.  Imodium didn't really help either.  It used to buy me some time with the IBS.  Some minor pain, more discomfort in abdomen and back.  Usually after eating, sometimes after a blow out.

I see my PCP- she ordered a CT scan and sent me home with a stool collection kit.  There are 5 vials to be collected over 24 hours and returned.  Long list of stuff to be tested to include elastase.  CT scan indicates a cyst.  MRI ordered.  Returned the stool specimens a few days later.  Called to follow up after a week, was advised it takes up to two weeks to get lab results.  OK.  

Get your Kleenex out.  Just after two weeks (and me carrying my phone everywhere waiting on them to call), they call.  Nurse says the dr. wants to know when I'm going to turn in my stool specimens.  HUH????  The lab lost my f\*\*ing stool samples.  Now I have to go through the most unpleasant collection again PLUS this has delayed my treatment which I assume will be Creon for at least another two weeks.  Furious, still am.  So I cried and cursed for about two hours straight, my poor partner was a saint, he listened patiently along with my awful poop stories and he has a weak stomach.  I picked up a new kit will try to collect starting tomorrow (Sunday) and hopefully turn back in on Monday.  

MRI was scheduled and I was not more than 2 miles from home on my way downtown and pooped my pants.  Fortunately I was sitting on a doubled beach towel, IBS has taught me a few things.  Cried and cursed all over again.  Going to try again this coming Tuesday and will likely fast on Monday to try to avoid this happening again.

What I've done:

  Almost completely eliminated fat from my diet.  A small amount, even Saltines have fat.  

Eating very light.  My rotation is salmon filet, pork loin chop lean, chicken breast no skin, dry baked potato salt only, canned green beans, canned and/or fresh spinach cooked with cider vinegar.  Daily banana(s), occasional orange.  No dairy, and I miss my cream in my coffee.  I drink 2-4 c. coffee daily as well as hot tea with a little honey.  Caffeine doesn't seem to affect it.

After reading through comments on message boards, ordered some enzymes from Amazon called Wholezymes.  Been experimenting with those for about 4 days now.  They seem to be helping some, at least buying some time to get to the toilet so no pooping my pants going on 4 days now.  Plenty of poop still but hasn't required a shower.

Keep a food journal along with notes as to how many enzymes taken and when, how bad and often the diarrhea is or isn't.  Was keeping even before the enzymes for my own information and get in the habit of doing this.

I am retired thankfully I don't know how you people that have to show up at a job are doing it I honestly don't.  I thought IBS was bad.... I feel certain the poop test will show low elastase and I should get my Rx for Creon then.  Or I assume so.  That's another 2 weeks.  I'm hoping the price will be affordable, my new insurance starts on March 1 probably about the time I will get the Rx.  I'll worry about that later.  

I don't know that the MRI will really show much or any surprises or hope not.  I'm not really concerned about pancreatic cancer it's very rare for a cyst to be cancerous.  My concern is being able to leave the house with some level of confidence and get some nutrients back.  My hair is thinning and stringy looking (I have a lot of hair still so I can afford to lose a little but it looks bad) and my fingernails are pitting and splitting.  I've lost about 20 lbs from December when I weighed at routine dr. appt.  I need to lose but not this way.

I am a smoker too but no alcohol.  I know I have some risk factors for developing EPI (diabetic, smoker, obese).  I do not believe I've had pancreatitis I just haven't been sick enough from what I've read it's terrible and you hurt bad.  Not my situation.  

Something I keep going back to in my mind... I took Trulicity with limited success last year for a while, my complaint was I didn't think it was working anymore even with increased doses.  Discussed with my dr. in early October she sent me home with an Ozempic sample pen.  I was violently ill after taking the Ozempic at the low starting dose.  Three days of migraine (I've barely suffered headaches at all in my life), throwing up, diarrhea, pain, fatigue... about the sickest I've ever been.  I said screw that Ozempic is not for me and really glad that was a sample and not a paid Rx.  So the next week I took the Trulicity I still had in the fridge... same horrible reaction maybe a little less severe but a 2 day migraine and some vomiting and fatigue.  A lighter version of the previous week but still bad.  I can't help but wonder if that Ozempic triggered something.  I explained this to my dr. and she looked at me like I had just explained flat earth theory.  I'm not convinced though.  

I appreciate any tips and suggestions;  I've read through many.  Also if anyone else has had a similar path with this.  And am I the only person here whose freakin' turds got lost?  Still mad.  I can only hope they're rolling around in the floorboard of some courier's car getting all moldy and stinky and maybe the lid will come off if I'm lucky.  

I guess too I'm just looking for a safe and caring place to vent and pick your brains.  Where else can you discuss poo, right?  Thanks in advance and really, thanks for all previous posts I think I've read about all of them and feel I learn something in all of them.

Oh... I'd like to know if my dairy days are over.  Dairy is my favorite food group.  I haven't touched it in a couple of weeks.  Anybody here able to tolerate a little cream and maybe sour cream and cheddar cheese and butter?  I guess that might vary.",1,1739663987.0,exocrinepanins,2,1.0,False

They said no coffee or caffeine ever! It's that true and what else should your avoid with ADHD medication? 

I only ask because I only drink coffee or milk and milk triggers IBS so without coffee I'll possibly struggle. It's not addiction just that I don't like other drinks. I can't drink anything with artificial sweeteners as that makes me ill and the big food companies are reducing sugar content while keeping the addictive sweetness by using sweeteners instead or even as well. If I even take a sip of something that's changed to artificial sweeteners I'll be ill with a severe migraine for hours.

This seems like a minor thing but it's not. Very little remains unadulterated with artificial sweeteners in the soft drinks sector these days. At least coffee out you're safe!

A little backstory; My partner and I work opposite shifts and, except for Saturdays, have different days off. I work Sun, Mon-Fri. 5am-2pm (I get up at 3:30am), he works Sun, Mon, Wed-Fri 12pm-8pm. We have a 5yo and 3yo and a 9mo. He gets the kids up at around 7 and leaves the house around 8 to get the oldest two to school and is home shortly after 9. He does dishes, takes care of the trash and sometimes does laundry but usually it's only his. Once that stuff is done, usually about 20 minutes, he'll play video games until a little after 11 when he leaves to bring the baby to the sitter before work. When I get out at 2 I go pick the middle child up from preschool and then the baby from the sitter's and make it home for a little after 3. I get the baby down for a nap, get backpack/diaper bag/my bag unpacked, a snack for the 3yo and then meet the bus for the oldest at 345. Then it's unpack his bag, do homework if he has some and get him a snack. 

Most nights I start dinner around 5, except for Wednesday's because my oldest has dance from 5-6 so we leave about 445. On that night we eat something when we get home at about 615. Then it's bedtime shortly after that for the baby. Monday's we have scouts 630 to 730 so we eat before then and when we get home I put the baby to bed right away. On Tuesdays when my partner is home I still get the oldest off the bus, do homework, take care of snacks, take care of dinner and hubby takes a nap shortly after I get home. Monday's, my day off, I get up and take the middle one to school while my partner gets the oldest on the bus. On Saturday's he sleeps in and I take care of the kids with everything and he can do whatever he wants uninterrupted for hours ( today he played a video game for 3 hours with no interruption). He might help get the older one's into PJs if he's home or might do bath time but not always. 

As far as household stuff goes I sweep, mop, do a majority of the laundry (which is pretty much a daily task with 5 people), I lay out all the outfits for the the oldest two for the week so he doesn't have to go digging looking for clothes every morning, I pack school bags, diaper bag, I set up coffees to brew every morning for myself and him, I clean the bathroom, I do any meal planning, all the grocery shopping (I admit sometimes it's delivery and there are days we all go but usually it's just me and three kids), the cooking, I take care of Drs/dentist appointments. (Even sick visits which are call morning of to get in. I stop what I'm doing at work to call and then let him know what's going on), school anything, cleaning up toys (I spend the most time home with the kids), I take care of the animals (""because I'm the one who wanted them and he doesn't want them"" even though we agreed to getting all of them together). I make sure 90% of the bills are payed (we do split them evenly I just am the one who sends the money). When it comes to birthdays or holidays I do all the planning and shopping, I get the kids clothes, if our kids need to stay home from school or our regular sitter can't watch them I have to figure out where they are all going, even if I'm at work and he's home. 

Last weekend for my birthday I just asked that I didn't have to do dinner at all. Like no part of it. It's getting on 330 and he has said nothing so I find a way to bring it up and he goes well what do you want? I'm like idk and he goes and takes a nap. So I end up going to the store and getting stuff for dinner and then cooking it while he plays a video game. 

Today (Saturday) I ask what everyone wants for dinner and I get a bunch of idks. Hubby asks what I want I say idk maybe Chinese either bought or homemade. It gets left at that. It gets to 5 and I tell the kids, who are all hungry, I'll figure dinner out and he asks me if I figured out what I wanted. I say idk, I'm tired of planning meals. His response is yeah,  hot dogs and Mac and cheese are so hard to plan. We're both professional chef's, we cook all day at work and it's a wide variety of foods. So when I do plan meals it's a pretty varied menu but lately I've been super burnt out with planning meals and we've been on and off sick for almost a month which doesn't help. After his comment I went into the kitchen fighting off tears, and then kind of passive aggressively made the kids sandwiches and ignored him. He went upstairs and laid down in bed. Anytime I've asked for help with things it lasts for a day or it's a response like 'if you didn't have so many pets it wouldn't be so bad"" (we have a dog, three cats, two tortoises, some hermit crabs and a couple Bettas and once again he agreed to all of them) I feel like maybe I'm overreacting or not being fair. Idk, I just need some outside thoughts.

1iqf566,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1iqf566/whats_my_next_step/,What's my next step?,"Haha, I'd like to start this post by acknowledging there are people out there with real problems and my life, as it is, is fine and I'm super duper grateful for that. Maybe I'm having a crisis due to age (I'm early middle age now) and the fact my health has been on a decline since COVID in 2022, and sadly getting long-COVID after it to which I still experience the affects to this day.

I don't know if it's a lack of meaning, or a lack of excitement, or maybe just life isn't as I pictured at this age - but I'm really really ready to make some changes. And I know what kind of changes they are, in a general sense. But it's the getting there that's hard.

I live an everyday life for a man my age - I work (Mon-Fri, 9-5) in a job I'm not crazy passionate about, but I do enjoy for what it is to support my young family. I come home, maintain the house, wind down with the family and then tomorrow we do it all again. We have fun weekends, and that's fantastic! It's all very normal.

I have a lot of skills, and that's not a brag, but I'm just very aware of my potential.  
I'm a great cook, I was almost cast on a reality show at one time for it.  
I'm a good writer, I used to be a relatively successful blogger 15 years ago.  
I'm a fast learner, I've studied multiple courses (two right now) and have been a top performer at every job I've had quickly despite lack of experience, I just pick things up fast.  
I had sharp social skills I'm not really able to utilize anymore due to time constraints, the quiet life is okay but I had it and I'm sure I could redevelop them.  
I've organized events, been involved in community projects.

These are all things that I don't often allow myself to acknowledge or make public, they make me feel big headed. I'm definitely the type to downplay my achievements, step aside and give others experiences and the like.  
It's something I struggle to snap out of and I really need to for my own sake before, in a few decades, my life hopefully flows down and I ponder what could have been. The way I handle things now, I will absolutely die wondering and I've decided I'm not okay with that.  
When something good does come my way, I question whether I needed or deserve it, without fail every time.

  
Yesterday I was a community event in a big city near me, it was amazing. I wanted so bad to be a bigger part of it, but alas, time is hard for me to manage to really devote myself to those things. Along with that I really lack the social connections people really need, and I know I need to find the right people put myself out there and make myself, what I can offer them known. But it's hard, it's like I'm still good socially when I get to a point with someone, but here in my early-40's what's the ice breaker? What's the thing that leads to the next coffee? Whats the thing that ingratiates you enough to have them go 'I have this thing...You know who'd be perfect for that?'

But I'm ranting and these things are piecemeal. I have a rough roadmap, I THINK.  
It involves somehow sustainably freeing myself up, whether that be starting a business or living on side hustles, or maybe a job with more flexibility (I've been applying for that kind of thing for about a year, nothing yet sadly.) maybe even the gig economy?

So I guess there's a general outline, and any advice is welcome advice. But my first question is, where do people find the time to take steps like this that offer more meaning.

How do people find the time to get involved in community, and ultimately build themselves up as someone opportunity approaches?  
  
I have no doubt this post makes any sense, and for that I'm so sorry.

""The Tiny Terror of Austin""

Joe Rogan wasn’t always a midget. In fact, he used to be a towering figure, both literally and figuratively. But after one particularly wild episode of The Joe Rogan Experience featuring a rogue biohacker, a mysterious serum, and a bet involving DMT, Joe woke up the next morning to find himself shrunk to a mere three feet tall. His muscles were still ripped, his head still perfectly round, but now he was... compact.

At first, Joe tried to laugh it off. He joked about it on his podcast, inviting guests like Elon Musk and Alex Jones to speculate on the science behind his sudden shrinkage. But deep down, Joe was furious. He couldn’t reach the top shelf of his fridge. He had to use a step stool to grab his favorite kettlebell. And worst of all, people started treating him differently. They patted him on the head, called him ""adorable,"" and even offered him kids' menus at restaurants.

One night, after a particularly humiliating encounter with a barista who asked if he needed a ""booster seat,"" Joe snapped. He retreated to his underground studio, surrounded by his collection of hunting knives, elk meat, and psychedelic mushrooms. As he stared into the abyss of his own reflection, a dark thought crept into his mind: What if I could make people respect me again?

And so, the Tiny Terror of Austin was born.

Joe’s first victim was the barista. He lured her to his studio under the guise of recording a special episode about ""the art of coffee."" When she arrived, he offered her a cup of his famous mushroom tea. As she sipped, he began to monologue about the nature of power, respect, and the fragility of the human ego. By the time she realized the tea was laced with a paralyzing agent, it was too late. Joe, with his newfound agility and strength-to-size ratio, overpowered her with ease. He left her body in the shape of a question mark, a cryptic message to the world.

The killings escalated from there. Joe targeted anyone who had ever underestimated him: the bouncer who carded him at a comedy club, the UFC fighter who joked about his height, even the guy at Whole Foods who always gave him the smallest avocado. Each victim was found with a tiny, perfectly round thumbprint on their forehead—Joe’s calling card.

The media went wild. ""The Midget Murderer"" trended on Twitter. Conspiracy theorists speculated that Joe’s transformation was part of a government experiment gone wrong. Alex Jones even claimed it was the work of ""globalist lizard people."" Meanwhile, Joe continued to host his podcast, casually dropping hints about his crimes between discussions about ayahuasca and the benefits of a carnivore diet.

The final showdown came when Joe’s longtime friend and fellow comedian, Duncan Trussell, confronted him. Duncan had pieced together the clues after noticing Joe’s unusual fascination with the concept of ""cleansing the world of ego."" Over a cup of mushroom tea (which Duncan wisely declined), Joe confessed everything.

""Don’t you see, Duncan?"" Joe said, his eyes wild. ""I’m not a monster. I’m a philosopher. I’m forcing people to confront their own mortality, their own insignificance. It’s the ultimate podcast episode—life, death, and the meaning of it all.""

Duncan, ever the voice of reason, tried to talk him down. But Joe was too far gone. In a final act of defiance, he leaped at Duncan with a hunting knife, only to be subdued by a well-placed yoga mat and a swift kick to the shin.

Joe Rogan was arrested, tried, and sentenced to life in prison. But even behind bars, his legend grew. His podcast continued, recorded from a makeshift studio in his cell, where he interviewed fellow inmates about their thoughts on the universe, the nature of evil, and the best way to cook prison ramen.

And so, the Tiny Terror of Austin became a cautionary tale—a reminder that no matter how small you are, your ego can still be your downfall.",0,1739662616.0,JoeRogan,0,0.29,False

I (26/F) have had stomach problems nearly my whole life. They vary between severe constipation, diarrhoea, acid reflux, and I am ALWAYS bloated. I have had an endoscopy and a colonoscopy but nothing was found. I was recently diagnosed with RCPD, meaning I can’t burp (never have as far as I can remember) and I find it extremely hard to vomit as well. Some of my issues can be explained by this disorder, but I highly doubt it’s the whole problem? Some of my most recent symptoms are:


-I wake up with a mildly painful bloat nearly every single morning, despite where I am in my menstrual cycle

-I am extremely gassy nearly all of the time (flatulence)

-I am always bloated, this is worse (by worse I mean my stomach is at its biggest) a week before my period.

-I only pass bowels maybe once-three times a week and they vary between runny to pellets, but mostly runny

-Recently it hurts to even sit up straight at times and I will need to lay down and wait to be able to pass gas or for the pain to just go away

-Unable to lose weight 


I’m currently 5”3/160 cm, 80 kgs/176 lbs, trying to lose weight drinking a lot of water and avoiding foods I know will make my stomach pain worse. 
I know I have a few bad habits that could possibly be making this worse (I vape, drink 2 coffees a day, and take ibuprofen near daily to keep my migraines and other body pains at bay) but I have had a lot of these problems nearly my whole life and don’t think that the cause can be linked to any of these bad habits?



Outside of the colonoscopy and endoscopy I haven’t gone to many doctors for this specific issue, half because they keep giving me laxatives which makes my pain worse and half because this has just always been my life and other issues have always taken priority.



Any direction would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

But when he meets his coworkers, Jack and Teddy, what starts as a simple work dynamic quickly turns into something far more dangerous. Secrets lurk beneath their reserved facades, and before Jay can make sense of it, he’s tangled in something bigger than himself—something centuries in the making.

In a world where the war never really ended, Jay is about to learn that some battles aren’t fought on the surface.

Some enemies cannot be reasoned with.

1iqekb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/satire/comments/1iqekb9/the_penny_war/,The Penny War,"In an office, far from the White House, the Pentagon, and even distant from the many intelligence agencies, a heated debate was raging.

“Our popularity keeps dropping. We promised the people lower prices: no more $12 for a box of eggs. Now the price is $16!”

“We need a new diversion. How’s the dollar-cent distraction panning out?”

“People got bored of it and started making all kinds of nonsensical statements about inflation and economic value. We’re being undermined by logic and left-wing radicals.”

“We should shut it down.”

“How can we shut down the dissent?”

“Not that. Shut down the internet.”

“Shut down the internet? You want to give them more reason to riot and shout about digital censorship?”

“No. We need something more direct. Something bigger.”

A silence fell over the room as the higher-ups exchanged glances, and then—

“Airborne leaflets.”

A low murmur filled the room.

“Airborne leaflets? What, like the old days?”

“Exactly. We print out a mass of ‘em. Drop ‘em all over the country—like a literal flood of freedom information. Let them read it. Let them see it. And let them know: We. Are. At. War.”

“But with who?”

“With them.”

And so it started. The internet went down, and only young people and radicals had access through their VPNs that no right minded senior American would bother to use.

An armada of planes took off to fight the most important war of all, the war for the hearts of the people. Squadrons as big as once flew over Europe dropped their payloads while darkening the sky.

Down below, a man picked up one of the falling leaflets. ""Hey Joe, look. They’re dropping newspapers.""

""Does it have a crossword puzzle?""

""No, it’s about us going to war. They’re going to save our economy. We will NOT surrender our pennies!""

Another neighbor chimed in. ""Even the paper looks like what was used back in the war, non-recycled, chloride-treated paper. Just like the good old days.""

Back in the undisclosed location, they watched the live feeds from security cameras and overwatch drones.

One screen showed a parade of mobility scooters rolling through a shopping mall, stripes and banners flowing proudly from their backs as they chanted, ""MAKE OUR PENNIES AGAIN!""

A data analyst adjusted his headset. ""Our popularity has skyrocketed with the elderly, but it's plummeting among younger demographics.""

The Secretary of Efficiency scoffed. ""It's always them. Idealistic idiots who don't understand what's important—pennies.""

As the sound of approaching planes the next day rattled windows and reverberated through the walls, people massed outside again, eager to see what news would come from the sky.

John fumbled his reading glasses a bit before reading:

""We will not stand for the undermining tactics of autocratic countries!

They tried to steal our wealth. They tried to manipulate our economy. Now, in our hour of need, we must stand strong. For the sake of stability and the security of our pennies, our great leader has selflessly volunteered to remain in office until this crisis is resolved!

Do your part. Support stability. Support continuity. Support the pennies!""

His neighbour proclaimed “We have won! No more woke, no more progression.”

John nodded slowly “No more elections.”

Meanwhile Joe flipped the leaflet over. ""Oh hey, there's another voucher. Acorn coffee—Drink Local Produce. Closed borders are safe borders.”

The newly empowered officials discussed their next step. “How could we use this all?”

“Penny Sneakers?”

“No, that sounds wrong on so many levels, we need big figures.” hands were spread wide to underline big.“

""We could really hark in a lot with crypto, crypto war bonds.”

“But we would need to declare war?”

“Just a technicality, one phone call away.”

“How will we sell this war to the Public?”

“Zinc. they should lower the prices of the metal so we can make pennies again.”

“Call that guy that says nuclear all the time and declare war!”

And so the Penny-war started. Influencers peddled the crypto war bonds, declaring total FOMO. Patriotic bands marched the streets, protesters were water-cannoned. All in all it was a great day moving forward into the old days.

Not to be outdone, the nuclear guy immediately ordered a strike after hanging up the phone. Ancient trains rolled out their bunkers, launch hatches opened. Nobody would come between him and his retirement plans. Plans that involved marrying the young daughter of a mining mogul. He would not let his bride's treasure go to waste.

Then missiles exploded. One might have expected them to launch first. About half of the missiles did nothing. Many others exploded on site. A few intercontinentals managed a couple of hundred miles, before falling back on random locations.

Meanwhile the US went eagerly to Defcon 3. A counter strike was ordered. Even more launch hatches opened. Salivating generals were just a button press away from unleashing doom, as the OHSA interjected. The launches would pollute the air too much. Domestic launches were out of the question. Grinning admirals took over.

Submarines from all involved sides (and quite a few non involved) moved at flank speed to start their exchange. They designated the Mediterranean as a hot zone and every sailor put himself in ready mode.

""This is life,"" said the US captain to what was supposed to be his adversary, lounging at the French Riviera with a glass of vodka-martini in hand.

The other captain nodded, slowly sipping from his red bull vodka.

An Hungarian submarine captain strolled over, happy he could finally meet the other captains on equal ground–they were without their boats too, and dared them to a drinking contest.

The utter lack of launches was observed with dismay. The backlash could be immense. A plan had to be made. The victory–any victory had to be proclaimed.

“Greenland?” Someone suggested.

“Yes, but that name is too woke. We call it Red-and-Whiteland from now on!”

Cheers erupted from the room, as disaster was averted. A few pinked tears of pride away–they did it again.

Slowly the room grew quiet, and reason replaced emotion once again.

“We could link the crypto war bonds to Red-and-Whiteland.”

It got approving nods from the tech moguls and ponzi-scheme-faraos, the prospects of another push and dump almost twisting their pupils into dollar signs.

The leaflets dropped again, headlining the victory against decadent Europe. Google maps, only available outside the US as the internet was still down, proudly showed the conquesting name change-comments disabled.

Feverishly (and suffering every other ailment) the fanbase assembled on the streets again.

With clattering dentals, breaking coughs and intersped with oxygen intakes, they marched and sang “All Hail to the Chief”. Some cried.

Frowning, a general watched it at the non disclosed location. “We can’t trust anyone from Gen-Z anymore. These are our soldiers.” pointing at the screen.

Everyone ranked CEO or higher started to nod. This made total sense. No economic upheaval, no protests, just writing off an non-profitable asset.

Within days the draft was complete. Soldiers sporting walking frames with machine guns marched proudly next to those equipped with flamethrower modded canes.

Over the past couple of years, I’ve tried my best, but things haven’t gone my way. In November 2023, I decided to make a change and get in shape. A year later, I’m over 80 pounds lighter and in the best shape of my life! I look pretty good, I’d say around 6 or 7, but I still haven’t had much luck meeting women or anyone else.

 When I was in high school, I moved to online school because of an inner ear injury that affects my balance, makes me feel nauseous, and causes anxiety. Since 2019, I’ve mostly stayed home. I travel for work and vacations, but when I’m back, I don’t really want to leave. This has been tough on me, and I’ve been struggling with self-doubt and depression. Sometimes, I don’t even want to go out for coffee or work on my cars. If I go out, it’s just to drive around and listen to my music. But I’m really craving something more - I want to meet people, have experiences, and make memories.

 I’ve tried dating apps, but I haven’t had any luck. I’m worried that it’s because of my personality. I don’t know if I need to change how I act or feel about things to appeal to a wider range of people. I mostly keep to myself when I’m not home and keep my opinions to myself. I don’t listen to modern music, stay up-to-date with pop culture, or have a social media presence. I’m more of an old soul - I listen to classic music, play the piano, own and restore classic cars, and have strong opinions about American culture and history. 

So, I’m asking for advice. How should I create or rebuild my social life? Should I get an online presence? Where should I go to meet different people? Are there steps I can take to become more comfortable in public places? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Even if it means I need to change my personality, I know I need to do something because I can’t stand having no one to talk to or nothing to get me out of the house.",1,1739661785.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1iqe9xq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iqe9xq,mental healthcare is not the same as full health insurance,"Hello all! Found out about this forum a couple weeks ago and it’s helped me feel a little less bonkers about my feelings about Chappell Roan.

Wondering if anyone else here has previously worked in nonprofits and can recognize their BS when looking through their website.

1st off all needing to make 50% of your income derived from music is definitely a choice, but sure. She wants to help people active in ~the industry~.

My problem is… is this helping?? Wasnt she speaking out for healthcare????? This is just mental health. And I say just as someone who has been severely mentally ill since childhood (I shouldnt have to list off my diagnoses, but I had crying/screaming meltdowns as a kid. I know how important mental health is. I just think having insurance that covers physical ailments is way more important). Not just that, Backline doesnt actually pay for the sessions themselves, they just set you up with someone who knows the industry. They claim to pay for sessions for people with low income, so I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt for that one.

Really it just seems like they have zoom meetings about mental health & function as a way for yoga and meditation apps to get a tax write off. 

But sure, she’s starting a revolution. She got like 200,000 dollars donated from a total of 9+ celebs for Backline. I just personally wouldn’t recommend anyone donate to an organization that cant clearly define what “sound fiscal management” is.

I think the industry is happy to hop along on this mental health ride cause it makes them look good at a wonderfully low cost!! Getting people yoga apps is way cheaper than getting them an insurance plan that covers surgery. 

I really dont know if Chappell Roan and her fans exist in the real world. This is not revolutionary. I guess I’ll give her props for speaking up about something, but I won’t say I respect the poor financial decision.

Also, putting your money where your mouth is means paying every member of your team a living wage. Yes, even the ones that get you coffee and send out emails on your behalf (in regards to the nail thing & Genesis Webb admitting she doesnt pay interns). 

She could be doing a lot worse, and historically the industry has always been filled with exploitation. I just think she’s just another cog in the machine & that she shouldn’t receive this much praise.",10,1739661308.0,ChappelGroan,3,0.92,False

Should I text him?,"I (F39) was friends with a guy (M40) for a few years. Fell in love with him but he was living in different countries for work, so I didn’t pursue it. During the pandemic he settled back in his home city. I saw him at an event a year later. We caught up, spent the weekend together and were still ‘friends’ at that point. 

He bought me a ticket to an event a few weeks later and at that event he confessed his feelings for me, told me he had been sitting on those feelings for 5 years, had been wanting to kiss me all that time but was scared of ruining our friendship etc. he said ‘I think we’ve been slow to move this’ and prior to this he had been telling me he wanted to settle down, get married etc and his single life wasn’t the dream his friends thought it was. As he geared up to confessed his feelings, I could see the fear in his face. EDIT: I reciprocated feelings, told him I wanted him, kissed him back, everything! 

I had to fly out for a trip the next morning (we didn’t sleep together). After that the energy shifted, after I returned from the trip I tried to talk to him about that night but it was like it never happened. I told him it had taken me by surprise and he said he was surprised by it too which felt odd to me since he moved the needle.

A few weeks later after he had ghosted, I discovered he was in a bar kissing a random girl. I saw a photo, cut him out of a WhatsApp group he had been in with some of my friends and felt utterly heartbroken for quite some time. He messaged me to ask if he did something bad and I told him I would leave him to figure this one out.

I’ve spent the past 3.5 years trying to heal but it’s hard because I genuinely thought I would end up married to this man. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw he was out playing the field after what happened between us.

I had been able to manage my emotions the last year or so but this weekend I just happen to be in his city for the first time since the feelings were confessed. It’s hit me like a train, I still love him, I never stopped. He did text me a couple of times with stupid pictures but there was never anything of any substance and I was too hurt to engage with it.

Men of Reddit - should I text him? I have one day left in his city. My pride tells me he treated me like shit and to leave it alone because he doesn’t want me. My heart tells me he loved me but didn’t know what to do with it so he ran. Should I ask him for coffee to talk?

1iqe7c0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scottishish/comments/1iqe7c0/my_deep_thoughts_about_life/,My Deep Thoughts About Life.,"I’m just a guy who likes to think. A lot. Not in a way that makes me any wiser or smarter than anyone else---just in a way that makes me, well, me. My mind constantly wanders and drifts toward the big questions that have puzzled humanity since the dawn of consciousness: What is the nature of reality? What does it mean to be truly alive? What is this mysterious thing we call flow, and how do we find it in our daily lives? I don’t claim to have the answers, but I find deep joy in exploring these eternal mysteries.

I’ve found that the more I sit with these thoughts, the more I realize how little control we actually have over the grand tapestry of existence---and how incredibly freeing that realization can be. Life is perpetual movement, constant change, endless transformation. It’s like a river that keeps flowing, whether we choose to fight against its current or learn to swim harmoniously with it.

So, this is me, thinking out loud, letting the thoughts take shape as they naturally emerge from the depths of consciousness. I’m not seeking grand conclusions or absolute certainty---just embracing curiosity, cultivating presence, and maintaining a willingness to see where the mysterious flow of existence leads.

Universe… one turning, one change. That’s what it means, doesn’t it? This has been occupying my thoughts lately with increasing frequency. The way everything is just… flowing. Moving. Transforming. Even as I sit here trying to pin down these thoughts, countless cells in my body are dying and being reborn in an endless dance of renewal. Nothing in this vast cosmos stays still for even a moment.

I’ve been deeply immersing myself in this subject lately – fascinated by how the word “universe” comes from Latin, uni- meaning “one” and versus meaning “turned” or “changed.” One single turning. One eternal moment of transformation. It’s like… everything we perceive is just this one continuous change, and we’re all inseparable parts of this grand cosmic dance.

The Earth spinning at what, 67,000 miles per hour through the vastness of space? And here I am sometimes feeling so static, so trapped in my thoughts and behavioral patterns. But I’m not stuck at all, am I? I’m literally hurtling through the cosmos on this celestial rock, with blood rushing through my veins, lungs expanding and contracting in perfect rhythm without any effort on my part.

Why do we humans fight so desperately against this fundamental nature of reality though? The inevitability of change, I mean. We grip onto things, relationships, and ideas as if they were solid, permanent fixtures in our lives. But they’re not. Nothing truly is. Even this precise moment, right now, as I’m carefully crafting these thoughts – it’s already slipped into the past. New moment. New me. New everything. The ancient Taoists had profound insight into this truth, I think. That whole concept of wu wei – effortless action through non-action. Not forcing, not controlling, just… flowing naturally. Being authentic. Like water finding its elegant path around any obstacle it encounters.

I’ve been consciously trying to practice this perspective lately in my daily life. Just… observing with full attention. Watching how everything moves in its own perfect rhythm. The wind dancing through the trees. The clouds constantly shifting and reforming overhead. The way my emotions rise and fall like waves on an infinite ocean. It’s all part of this massive, endless cosmic dance, isn’t it? And I’m not outside of it, not some detached observer. I AM it.

That realization is simultaneously terrifying and breathtakingly beautiful. I am the change itself. Not separate from it. Not controlling it. Just… being it in each moment. My breath serves as a constant reminder of this truth. Each breath uniquely different from the last. Never exactly the same twice. A persistent reminder that change isn’t something that happens TO us – it’s what we ARE at our core.
You know what’s been particularly helpful in understanding this? These simple mindfulness practices I’ve been experimenting with lately. Like in the morning, instead of rigidly forcing myself to stick to some predetermined routine, I try to sensitively feel what feels right in each moment. What the natural flow is calling for. It’s often subtle, not some dramatic shift in behavior, but rather small mindful adjustments. Following the natural rhythm of life instead of constantly fighting against it.

The mental aspects are definitely the most challenging though. These persistent thoughts that spin and spiral endlessly, creating their own little universe of worry and endless what if scenarios. But even they’re not solid or permanent. They come and go like weather patterns across the sky of consciousness. Dark clouds, sunny skies, storms, peaceful calm… all passing through the same vast space of pure awareness. I’m gradually learning to watch them without getting hopelessly caught up in their drama.

Sometimes I find myself questioning whether I’m going a bit crazy thinking about all this metaphysical stuff. Like, who really spends their time contemplating the profound nature of change and the vast mysteries of the universe? But then again, maybe that’s exactly what we as conscious beings should be thinking about. Maybe all our seemingly important daily dramas and concerns are just… tiny ripples on the surface of something infinitely deeper and more meaningful than we typically realize.

I’ve been diving deeper into this fascinating world of mindfulness and present-moment awareness too. It’s truly remarkable how much of life’s rich tapestry we miss when we’re caught up in our endless stream of thoughts about the past or anxieties about the future. Like this one particularly memorable day, I was walking to the local store -- something I’ve done countless times before without much thought – but this time I made a conscious effort to be fully present in the experience. The way the golden sunlight filtered through the vibrant leaves, creating these intricate dancing shadows on the concrete sidewalk below. The melodious symphony of birds I usually completely tune out in my mental busyness. Even the subtle sensation of my feet making contact with the ground with each mindful step. It was as if I was seeing the familiar world through entirely new eyes. 

Then there’s this profound concept of non-attachment that I’ve been wrestling with lately. Not in some cold, emotionally disconnected way that some might misinterpret it as, but in this deeply loving and accepting way of being. I can care intensely and passionately about things and people while also maintaining a understanding that everything in this universe is temporary, always in a state of flux and transformation. This perspective has actually enhanced my appreciation for life’s precious moments. When you truly internalize that nothing is permanent, you naturally cherish each experience more deeply in the present moment.

I’ve been actively experimenting with this intriguing idea of emotional alchemy as well. Instead of fighting against or trying to suppress negative emotions, seeing them as pure energy that can be consciously transformed through awareness. When anxiety bubbles up about an approaching deadline or an important meeting, instead of getting hopelessly tangled in the mental narrative around it, I try to simply observe it with gentle awareness. Feel it move through my body like a wave of energy. It’s really just energy in motion when you think about it. E-motion. Pure life force expressing itself through these temporary forms we call feelings.

And speaking of subtle energy – I’ve been developing a heightened sensitivity to how it flows through different spaces and situations in my daily life. Like how some environments just feel heavy and stagnant, as if the energy has become trapped and needs clearing, while others feel light, vibrant and alive with possibility. Or how certain individuals seem to have this remarkable ability to shift the energetic frequency of an entire room just by walking into it. We’re all these complex fields of living energy, constantly influencing and being influenced by everything and everyone around us in this intricate dance of interconnection.

The body knows all this stuff naturally and instinctively. It’s the analytical mind that so often forgets these basic truths. The body exists in a constant state of flow, always adapting, always responding with intelligence to what each moment presents. It’s only our thoughts and concepts that create this persistent illusion of solidity, of permanence, of separation from the whole. I’ve been practicing awareness of this in small everyday activities. Like when I’m walking, consciously feeling how each step naturally flows into the next in perfect harmony. Or when I’m preparing food, noticing with fascination how ingredients transform and combine to become something entirely new and hopefully delicious.

I’ve been contemplating the nature of resistance a lot lately, examining how much precious life energy we waste fighting against what simply is. Like this one morning – I found myself stuck in traffic, and I could feel that all-too-familiar tension rising in my body like a tidal wave. But then, in a moment of clarity, I remembered: this too is simply part of life’s eternal flow. Instead of resisting this reality, I made a conscious choice to sink deeply into the present moment. Used this unexpected pause to truly listen to the music playing through my speakers, to observe with fascination the intricate play of morning light on the cars ahead, to notice my own breath moving in and out. It’s truly remarkable how differently the exact same external situation feels when you stop exhausting yourself by fighting against reality.

The really mind-bending aspect of all this is contemplating the mysterious nature of time itself. We typically talk about past, present, and future as if they’re these fixed, separate, and objective realities. But are they really? Time is often spoken of as if the past, present, and future are distinct and concrete. But in reality, only the present moment truly exists. The past is nothing more than memory—fragments stored in your mind, recalled only in the now. The future is merely imagination—possibilities and projections that exist only as thoughts in this moment. Everything you have ever experienced, everything you ever will, happens only in the now. Time, then, may not be a fixed reality but rather a construct of the mind, a way we try to make sense of the ever-flowing present. Einstein revolutionized our understanding by showing that time itself is relative, right? And when you really sink into this state of flow, this dimension we call time seems to… shift and bend in fascinating ways. Sometimes an hour can feel like a mere breath, sometimes a single minute feels like an eternity. Perhaps time itself is just another aspect of this grand cosmic dance of perpetual change and transformation.

You know what continues to amaze me? The more fully I embrace this natural flow of life, the more I notice how things just… work themselves out in often unexpected ways. Not always according to my limited personal preferences or expectations, but they invariably work out in ways that serve growth and evolution. It’s as if the universe itself possesses its own intelligence, its own organic way of unfolding. When I stubbornly try to force reality into conforming with my limited vision and understanding, I create suffering for myself. But when I trust in this universe… that’s when life reveals its magic in surprising ways.

I’ve been actively experimenting with applying this understanding to my relationships as well. It's fascinating to observe how differently these connections feel when you release the need to control everything, when you allow people the freedom to be who they authentically are instead of who you think they should be according to your preferences and projections. It’s like… the more I let go of rigid expectations and demands, the more genuine and vibrant these relationships naturally become.

There’s something particularly fascinating about the creative process too – how inspiration flows with effortless grace when you manage to get your analytical mind out of the way. I was carving a stone one day, and for quite a while, I was stuck in my head about it, trying too hard to make it “good” according to some imagined standard. But then something magical shifted in my awareness, and suddenly it wasn’t “me” doing the carving anymore in any conventional sense. It was as if the stone itself was gradually revealing its form through my hands. I completely lost track of time in that state of pure flow. Came back to normal awareness hours later with dust covering my hands and this profound sense of having been part of something far greater than my individual self.

Through direct experience, I’m learning that true surrender isn’t passive or weak at all as some might think. It’s actually this moment-by-moment conscious choice to step courageously into the unknown and trust that the universe has a greater wisdom than our limited minds can comprehend. It’s about releasing our desperate need for control and opening ourselves fully to what is, rather than remaining caught in our ideas about what we think should be. Much easier to talk about than to actually live, though, isn’t it?

Sometimes, in moments of quiet contemplation, I find myself imagining my existence as an inseparable part of this vast, endless cosmic dance. Countless stars being born and dying in spectacular supernovas, entire galaxies spinning in their celestial ballet, planets tracing their eternal orbits through the void, and here I am – a brief but conscious flicker of awareness in this infinite flow of existence. But even in my brevity, I’m fundamentally connected to the whole. Even in my apparent smallness, I’m woven into the fabric of all that is. My very atoms were forged in the hearts of ancient stars, and they will one day become part of something entirely new.

The ancient wisdom traditions understood these profound truths at a deep level. That’s precisely why they chose to call it uni-verse. One turning. One change. One eternal moment of perpetual transformation. In our modern reality we’re not really discovering anything new – we’re simply realizing what the ancients knew, what our bodies have always known at a cellular level, what the very nature of reality has been ceaselessly trying to communicate to us since the beginning of time.

My understanding of death has been transforming lately too. Instead of seeing it as this final, terrible ending to be feared and avoided, I’m beginning to recognize it as an integral part of the natural flow of existence. Everything in the natural world moves through these endless cycles of birth, death, and rebirth. The seasons, the cycles of the moon, the rising and setting of the sun – why should human consciousness be any different? Perhaps what we typically call death is simply another form of transformation, another turning in this infinite cosmic dance that never truly begins or ends.

There’s something profoundly liberating about embracing this deeper understanding of reality. I don’t have to carry the impossible burden of having everything figured out. I don’t need to know with certainty where all of this is ultimately going. My role isn’t to somehow direct or control the river of life – it’s to learn to swim with it gracefully, to trust its ancient wisdom, to allow it to carry me exactly where I need to go for my highest evolution.

And the synchronicities – they seem to multiply once you start paying attention with awareness. Those remarkable moments of perfect timing, those seemingly random “coincidences” that feel more like gentle whispers from the universe itself. Like yesterday’s experience, when exactly the book I needed somehow found its way into my hands at precisely the right moment. These aren’t mere chance occurrences but rather confirmations of our deeper connection to the whole.

I’ve been practicing this approach where instead of forcefully trying to implement changes in my life according to some mental plan, I attempt to align myself more naturally with the changes that are already wanting to happen through me. It’s similar to… you know that experience when you’re swimming in the ocean, and you can either exhaust yourself fighting against the powerful waves or learn to move in harmony with them? When you resist and fight, you quickly become depleted. But when you learn to move with their natural rhythm, there’s this… effortless grace that emerges naturally.


I’ve been consciously applying this understanding to my work as well. Instead of forcing myself to push through periods of natural resistance, I’m learning to notice and honor the times when I’m naturally energized and aligned with the flow of creativity and productivity. When I work with these natural rhythms rather than against them, I find that not only does the quality of my work improve dramatically, but the entire experience becomes more enjoyable and fulfilling. Sometimes this means working intensely during periods of natural inspiration, while other times it means allowing myself to rest and recharge when my energy naturally ebbs.

Perhaps this is what all the great spiritual teachers throughout history have been trying to help us understand. That we’re not actually separate from this vast flow of existence as we so often believe. We’re not isolated islands standing alone in the middle of a flowing river of life. We ARE the river itself in human form. The flow isn’t some external force we need to somehow tap into or connect with – it’s what we fundamentally are at our deepest level of being. Our very essence is this flow, this dance, this eternal movement of life expressing itself through temporary forms.

I’m gradually learning to say yes to all of it, to embrace the totality of human experience. The moments of transcendent joy and the periods of deep pain. The times of effortless ease and the challenges that stretch us beyond our comfort zones. The beautiful blossoming of growth and the necessary decay that makes new life possible. Because it's all one seamless movement, isn’t it? One vast, beautiful, terrible, magnificent flow of being expressing itself in infinite ways. And I’m not separate from any of it. I never was. I never could be. This understanding brings both profound responsibility and incredible freedom.

Sometimes the most profound and transformative truths are also the simplest and most obvious once we have eyes to see them. Like this morning, I was simply sitting with my steaming cup of coffee, watching with fascination as the delicate wisps of steam rose and spiraled in the crisp morning air. And suddenly it hit me with the force of revelation – that’s me too. That’s all of us. Rising, spiraling, dissolving, becoming something new in each moment. Over and over and over again in this eternal dance of transformation. The steam wasn’t just showing me its nature, but revealing my own nature to me in that moment of clarity.

Maybe that’s the greatest gift of this deepening understanding – this profound sense of belonging to something far greater than ourselves. Of being an integral part of something so vast and incomprehensibly beautiful that my limited human mind can’t fully grasp or contain it. But the beautiful truth is that I don’t need to intellectually comprehend it all. I just need to flow with it, trust it, allow it to move through me and as me in each moment. My role is to be a conscious participant in this grand dance of existence.

And so here I sit, allowing these thoughts to flow through my awareness like water moving through a stream bed. Each moment entirely unique and different from the last. Each breath marking a new beginning in this eternal now. Each heartbeat serving as a reminder that I am alive, I am changing, I am the change itself expressing through this particular form. The universe isn’t something out there, separate from who and what I am. It’s what I am in my deepest essence. What we all are at our core. One vast, eternal moment of transformation, expressing itself in infinite ways through all forms and phenomena.

One verse. One change. One eternal dance of being. And I am dancing it, whether I remember this truth in each moment or not. We all are, every single one of us. Maybe that’s enough. Maybe that’s absolutely everything. Maybe in that simple understanding lies the key to living with both grace and purpose in this magnificent mystery we call life.

I’ve gone from being so excited for my job back in December. To dread everyday. 

I've gone through so many transitions in my private life, such as going through a breakup, moving to a new city, and starting university. So, in a way, I'm proud of myself. However, I let my manager know that I don't appreciate the way she treats me. She corrects me in front of customers, brags about how many drinks she can make compared to me and makes me feel humiliated. All in front of customers. I noticed that people walk past me and to the more experienced barista when I'm about to take the order. it makes my heart drop inside. I realise there's a great deal of trust when making drinks. And they don't trust me. 

I notice only when I'm on shift with my manager, that's when people will say 'no I want 'x person' (my manager) to make my drink not you.' 

I messaged my manager about this one week ago and she still hasn't replied. 


the message without giving too much away said something along the lines of 

Hiya (manager's name) , I wanted to speak to you about if you could give me constructive feedback and try and help me get up to your level and standards? I appreciate your help and that you are trying to guide me in the corrrect direction by being firm and disciplined and honest, sometimes it makes me feel sad that I’m not improving fast enough. I lose focus and then I feel that my concentration is bad for the whole shift and then I start making mistakes. Please help me be more effient, give me tips and point me in the right direction. I understand that you often correct me in front of customers, but sometimes it makes me feel humiliated and upset and then I feel that the customers do not respect me because they can see that you do not respect me. I work part time, 16 hours, I will work harder to get to your level because I admire how quickly you work and I want to do just as well as you. I want to do better, and do well for the team, let’s be positive and work together to achieve our goals :))


I sent this after noticing that some people in the queue said audibly 
'I hope we don't get the trainee'
'I heard the service is so slow in here'
they then got me (the trainee) and looked annoyed. 

Today my latte art was really bad, and I visbly see the customers get upset when I do bad latte art. It's not the first time. But today was different, a girl walked in, and asked for a cappuccino, I made it walked away from her drink to get the chocolate powder and then her boyfriend and her looked at my drink and laughed but then looked relieved when I was covering up the drink with chocolate powder. I'm taking a latte art course asap now so I'm doing something about it. 

Being in this part of the country brings back bad memories for me, I got bullied for not being as rich as the other kids. The mannerisms of people here are still the same and it upsets me, deeply. 


I'm still a temp until April, but I've been at this coffee place since December. Because of how clumsy and ditsy I am I feel that my coworkers have to talk to me like I'm 5 and make fun of me or hate being on shift with me. It honestly upsets me so much I'm crying while writing this. I have work tomorrow and even the thought of going back makes me cry.

I thought everyone had them too. Like a little imp living inside one’s head, thriving on one mischievous idea after another.


“Let’s not study today and head out to play!” He often seemed innocent or harmless enough though it started taking a more nefarious turn at times. “Just ignore Mum and Dad. What do they know anyway?”


Some called it a battle between good and evil in my head. An angel and a demon trying to convince me to their cause. Except that it was only one side speaking all the time. Was I supposed to be the angel?


I never thought I needed help till I was in my late teens. “Bash his face in! He insulted you, you’re going to be pussy about this?” Thankfully my friends managed to drag me off him in time.


Frankly, I don’t think the counsellors or the psychiatrist ever really understood what was going on. How could they? To them, I was a just another rebellious teenager with anger management issues. How was I to explain that there were times the voice grew so loud in my own head it seemed to bump me out of the cockpit and take over? He knew everything about me, my weaknesses and my insecurities and he knew what made me tick.


I think I finally manage to get a handle on things after getting into meditation and the like, focusing on emptying my mind. Thankfully it did help, or yours truly would have been writing this from inside a psychiatric ward while on - a long term stay. 


The voice did return with a vengeance while I was in college. Staying in a dorm room by myself with raging hormones didn’t help a single bit. “Ah she seems passed out. You know you want it! Who would know anyway?” “Oh please, just tell her she was all over you in the morning!”


You know, it was a miracle I even graduated with honours with all the pills and drugs I took to keep him at bay in my head. The meditation and focused thoughts could only keep him quiet for so long.


He seemed to have mellowed down once I started work. Perhaps he decided to give poor old me a break for once. I don’t think I could have even functioned with him around in full force and even hold a job. Yet he was never gone, always lurking in the background and never hesitating to remind me he was there. “Oh just a push! Everyone will think he fell on his own onto the tracks.”


Things were beginning to look up. I had a girlfriend. I no longer had thoughts about ending it all, myself along with this monster inside my head. My memory is a little hazy but there were days when he uttered no more than a sentence or two.


One fine morning, I woke up after what was a long week at work. The sun seemed exceptionally brighter than usual and somehow, my head never felt as peaceful as it did today. Something was different but I couldn’t quite put a finger to it.


As I got to make my morning coffee, I could see a figure in the corner of my eye moving towards the door. Its familiar voice was as clear as it ever was.


“Goodbye Andrew.” Startled, I turned and there it was, a spitting image of me staring right back with a smirk on its face as he turned the door handle.

But let me start earlier.  

It was raining that night—the kind of cold, needling rain that soaks through your clothes and pricks your bones. I’d stayed late at O’Malley’s, nursing a whiskey to avoid going home to my empty apartment. The bartender, a grizzled guy named Walt, kept glancing at the door like he wanted to close up. “Last call was an hour ago, pal,” he’d grumbled, wiping down glasses with a rag that smelled of mildew. I tossed a twenty on the bar and stumbled into the alley, shortcutting toward my car.  

Big mistake.  

The alley reeked of dumpsters and wet asphalt. A flickering bulb above the back door spat feeble light, casting long shadows that seemed to *twitch*. I’d taken three steps when I heard it—the crunch of a boot behind me. Before I could turn, an arm hooked around my throat, squeezing until my vision pulsed with black stars.  

“*You*,” a voice snarled. Hot, sour breath hit my ear—whiskey and rotting teeth. “Think you can talk to my girl? Think she’s yours?”  

I didn’t even know who he meant. The new waitress? The woman who’d sat two stools over, laughing with her friends? My lungs burned as I clawed at his arm, my nails scraping over tattooed skin. He laughed, low and wet, and spun me around.  

His face was like a nightmare. Pockmarked and covered in scars with a spiderweb tattoo crawling up his neck. One eye was milky white, blinded, the other a sharp, hateful blue. “Pretty boy,” he spat. A switchblade flicked open in his hand, its edge glinting under the dying street light. “Let’s see how pretty you are when I’m done.”  

The first stab went into my gut.  

I’d never felt pain like that—a white-hot *rip*, like he’d unzipped my insides. I gagged, tasting bile and blood. He yanked the blade out just to plunge it into my shoulder, pinning me to the alley wall. I screamed, but he clamped a hand over my mouth, his fingers digging into my jaw. “Shhh,” he hissed. “Don’t wanna wake the neighbors, do ya?”  

He worked slowly. Sadistically. The knife dipped into my thigh, my side, my chest—not deep enough to kill, just enough to make me writhe. Blood pooled in my shoes, warm and slick. I tried to beg, but all that came out was a wet gurgle. I knew I liked to flirt a little when I was drunk, but c’mon, did I really deserve to die for it?? 

He leaned in, his ruined eye inches from mine. “She might’ve smiled at *you* tonight,” he whispered. *”But she’ll scream when she sees what’s left.”*

The final cut was the worst. He dragged the blade across my throat, slow, savoring the split of skin. I felt it—the *pop* of something vital—before the world tilted. My knees hit the ground. The rain diluted the blood, washing it in pink rivulets toward the gutter.  

The last thing I saw was his boots stepping over me. “Sweet dreams, pretty boy.”  

***  

I woke up choking on dirt.  

My lungs burned. My fingers clawed upward, nails splitting against rocks and roots until I burst through the soil like some grotesque seedling. Moonlight glared down, cruel and bright. I rolled onto my back, gasping, my shirt stiff with dried blood and mud. The grave was shallow, half-hearted, dug beneath a gnarled oak at the edge of the city’s forgotten cemetery.  

That’s when I heard the whimper.  

A stray dog—mangy with visible ribs pawed at the edge of the grave. Its eyes glowed yellow in the dark. Instinctively, I reached out, my hand trembling. “Hey… it’s okay,” I rasped.  

The moment my fingers brushed its fur, the dog *seized*. Its legs stiffened. A gurgling sound bubbled from its throat, and then it collapsed, tongue lolling, eyes clouded like marbles.  

I scrambled back, heart thrashing. The corpse began to… *rot*. Flesh sagged, fur sloughed off in clumps, and within seconds, all that remained was a greasy skeleton and the stench of decay.  

“What the *fuck*?” I whispered.  

The wind answered. Not with words, but with… *voices*. A chorus of them, hissing like static, overlapping, urgent.  

***Kill.***  

***Kill them all.***  

***Feed us.***  

I clapped my hands over my ears, but the whispers slithered into my skull anyway, oily and insistent. My head throbbed. I stumbled toward the road, my legs jelly, my hands leaving smears of grave dirt on street signs. The world felt tilted, wrong.  

The first person I saw was a jogger. Pre-dawn, neon vest glowing. He nodded as he passed, earbuds in, oblivious.  

My hand grazed his arm.  

And with that he dropped mid-stride, faceplanting onto the asphalt. His body convulsed once, twice, then stilled. Skin grayed, peeling like wet paper. The whispers purred.  

***Yes.***  

***More.***  

I ran. Or tried to. My feet carried me to the 24-hour diner on 5th, the one with the sticky booths and coffee that tastes like burnt tires. A waitress stopped in her tracks as I staggered in—*“Honey, you look like hell, what happened?”*, she exclaimed as she reached out to steady me.  

Big mistake.  

Her fingers touched mine, and her smile melted. Literally. Her face sagged, eyes liquefying, teeth clattering to the floor like Chiclets. The other customers screamed. So did I.  

The cops came. Of course they did. Officer Ramirez, a local cop who’d pulled me over more than once, drew his gun. “Hands where I can see ’em!”  

I raised them, trembling. “I didn’t—*I don’t know what’s happening*”

He grabbed my wrist.  

A wet *crunch* echoed as his bones turned to dust inside his skin. He crumpled, uniform collapsing into a sack of meat and rot. The whispers roared now, a hurricane in my head.  

***Don’t stop***  

***No mercy.***  

***We are hungry.***  

I fled into the streets, a monster in a dead man’s skin. Every accidental brush—a homeless man’s shoulder, a woman’s purse, a child’s stray ball—left corpses in my wake. The news called it a bio-terror attack. The National Guard quarantined the city.  

But they can’t stop me.  

The whispers guide me now. They’re *louder* when I kill on purpose. When I *lean into it*. I stand on rooftops and watch the chaos below—sirens, fires, bodies piled like cordwood. My fingers drum against the concrete ledge, itching to touch, to *feed*.  

I don’t sleep. Don’t eat. The hunger isn’t in my stomach.  

It’s in my hands.  

Last night, I found the man who murdered me. He was holed up in a motel, watching the news, a bottle of Jack in his fist. I didn’t say a word. Just pressed my palm to his sweaty forehead and watched his eyes burst like overripe grapes.  

The whispers laughed.  

They’re right, of course. This isn’t a curse.  

It’s a gift.  

So here I am, walking down Main Street, arms wide, fingertips grazing everything—mailboxes, car doors, screaming faces. They fall like wheat under a scythe. The air reeks of spoiled milk and copper.  

And the whispers?

On her first day I spent some time getting her set up on her company equipment (I work IT) and she seemed pleasant. Over the next couple of weeks we talked about music and films and all sorts of oddities. We quickly realised we were ""the same kind of weird"" and hit it off massively. 

Now, full disclaimer, I'm prone to crushes. I don't remember having a female friend I didn't at some point think about asking out. I go all gooey headed and there's no real helping me. Normally it either doesn't last that long or I ask and get rejected. It sounds grim, but I'm used to it, so while it smarts for a couple of days I'm soon over it.

So, our works Christmas party rolls round and I'm completely infatuated. We agree to travel there and back together as I live near a train station. We get there and she's gorgeous. I could have died on the spot happy. We go out, have a nice night with our colleagues and get the train back out of the city.

So, 5 or 6 months in, I finally ask the question. I suggest we go out again some time, just the two of us. She agrees. This is fabulous. 

Over the next couple of days we agree to meet at a restaurant nearby, cosy little Italian place, family owned. Prior to the meetup she expresses some concerns about what my expectations are for the evening, I try and be very honest about the fact I don't have any. I'm genuinely just happy to be going out for dinner, on what can only be described as a date.

Anyway, we get to the restaurant and within the first 10 minutes she says she doesn't think anything is going to happen between us, she's just not getting that vibe. Great, this is usual, we've done this before. I open up very honestly , tell her I'm disappointed that she feels that way but I understand. We have dinner, I regale her with stories about my misspent teen years, we go home and that's the end of that in my head. We're still friends, no problem.

Some time in January, I decide to go suit shopping. I wear one for work, and I figure this is a handy little excuse to hang out. She agrees, and we go one Saturday. We shop, nip in here and there, make conversation, the usual. We decide to grab some lunch at about 2pm and spend 4 hours talking in a cafe. It was a lovely day out, and one I'll remember for a while.

So after this we start talking on the phone, 3-4 hours is easy, just talking about everything and nothing. We also go for coffee, and it's the same there. We have a great time. We text constantly, share music and bitch about people from work. At this point we are basically best friends.

I've spoke to her about how I am at this point pretty much head over heels for her. I have no qualms talking about my feelings, one of my friends has said in the past that I ""love freely"" and that's pretty accurate. I've never tried to be pushy about it, I totally understood that she didn't reciprocate these feelings and that wasn't a problem for me, so long as I wasn't expected to keep it to myself and fester. She found my openness odd, but not uncomfortable, she liked knowing where she stood with me. On a couple of occasions hands were held, nobody talked about it and it wasn't an issue.

Roll around to the day before my 30th birthday, a Sunday. She asks if she can call that night to drop off my present, as it's a bit of an odd size. I agree and talk her into a movie night, a film and some cheap takeout food. Basically a house date, except not a date, because she doesn't want to date. She agrees, she'll come round about half 5.

She shows up and hands me a framed poster of Jacques Brel, the great Belgian chanson. This is probably the best gift I've had this year, it's fantastic and she's probably the only person on earth that would have bought it for me. 

We put on a movie and melt into the sofa. After the first 20 minutes or so, I wave her into a cuddle. At this point, honestly, I'm just seeing what I can get away with. She doesn't question it, turns her back to me and I wrap my arm around her. We talk through the movie, laughing and guessing and all the rest. We get through the first film and she looks at the time, suggests a second film. I'm in no rush to get rid of her, so absolutely.

About... 3/4 of the way through the second film, she's progressively slid down from my shoulder and is now lying on my stomach. I've stretched my legs out over the coffee table to facilitate this, and she's rolled her hips so she no longer really watching the movie. My hand is on her waist, she's stroking my forearm with her fingers. It's a perfect moment. One of those you could frame and keep forever. 

She kisses me. I want to say that again, she kisses me. It's a perfect kiss, just the right amount of greedy. At this point I have no idea how I've pulled this off. There are a couple more kisses throughout the night, and then she leaves. How have I done this? How has this happened? When do I wake up? All very exciting questions for the following day.

Monday and Tuesday happen, I even get another kiss on Monday as shes leaving the office (out of sight.) we joke about the fact we're ""not dating"" as she gets flustered and tells me to shut up through giggles, it's all good.

On Tuesdays night she mentions that she doesn't really know what we're doing and I ask her to date me. It's only a half question, something to tick the box that somebody did actually ask somebody. She tells me she's not sure, she's still trying to figure things out. That's unexpected but not an issue, I'm the guy that got kissed, she can call it what she likes until she wants to call it that.

Roll on Wednesday, and she's coming to my house again for more movies (and hopefully more kissing, if I play my cards right) we put the movie on, she curls into my arm again, all is good. We order some food and when it arrives I bring up the night before. I apologise for pushing her for an answer, I've always said we don't need labels etc etc. 

This begins a conversation about the fact she still doesn't know how she feels, that she kissed me to hopefully get an answer, and didn't. In her mind, she'd know by now if something was there, and she doesn't. This is her sign that it's not meant to be.

I'm devastated. I'd spent the last couple of days in a haze that was now quickly pulled away. I was stupid enough to think she felt the way I did, even just a little, but now she's telling me she doesn't. We watch the end of the movie with me clinging to her for dear life. I know this is probably the last time we'll do this, so I should make the most of it.

Thursday I'm a wreck. For the record, I'm riddled with depression and I'm just not ready for any of this. I'm sobbing in the men's toilets listening to French love songs and I'm barely keeping it together in the main office. From other people in the office I've found out she was upset as well, she felt like a monster for what had happened and so we were both a mess separately. I didn't even speak to her that day, tried not to look at her for fear of it setting me off.

I get home and prepare to cry myself to sleep. Flicking through my music I find a song by Wolf Larsen called ""Kitchen door"", it's all very slow and mellow and I suspect it'll set me off. As I listen though, I have a grand realisation. I shouldn't be sad, she's just an idiot! We'd exchanged a couple of texts that morning and she'd explained some of her thoughts. 

One was that I loved her more than she did me. Now I get this, and it can be an issue in a relationship. But usually it's an issue for the person that's most into the relationship, not the lucky sod thats being loved.

Secondly, she had felt awkward around me for the Monday and Tuesday. Now I don't know about you, but when I kiss someone I feel weird around them for a couple of days afterwards.

So here I am, manic after all my crying earlier in the day. She's just making poor decisions, she'll realise me being madly in love with her isn't such a bad thing and that awkward feelings pass pretty quickly and we'll be right back on track.

Anyway, the mania didn't last and by the end of Friday I was successfully crying myself to sleep.

So here I am, still madly in love with someone that either A. Has no interest in me or B. Doesnt realise they do. What the hell do I do from here? I can't explain how much I like her, and how well we get on and how badly I'd love this to work, but at the same time it might just... Not. Give me all your terrible advice folks, do I cling to the hope or do I try to reduce contact until it all stops hurting so damn much? I'm still a mess at the minute, so I'm open to most advice.

Tl;dr I like her, she says she doesn't like me but kissed me anyway, is this salvageable?",0,1739660552.0,relationship_advice,1,0.33,False
1iqdz4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1iqdz4o/used_by_a_mormon_for_a_child_seeking_answers/,Used by a Mormon for a Child – Seeking Answers,"I was used by a Mormon for a child. After being married for 1.5 years and shortly after our daughter was born, my ex-wife attempted to kidnap her and completely alienate my side of the family. While my ex claims to be ex-Mormon, her parents are still heavily involved in the church and seem to have played a major role in everything that’s happened.

One of the accusations my ex made in her divorce documents was that I was trying to “balance coffee and wine” and that I got drunk one day, which she claims was a big issue. For context, I did nothing inappropriate or dangerous. What makes it worse is that she also drinks and was the one encouraging me to drink the day before she left, in front of all her friends. That day feels so suspicious and coordinated—it just makes me feel dirty thinking about it.

Looking back, it feels like her and her family had a coordinated plan to love bomb me, have a child, and then immediately divorce me for reasons that feel completely fabricated. But the plan seems to have backfired, and now we’re all stuck in the aftermath. I still can’t figure out what their motivations were or how a family could orchestrate something like this. Why not just get a sperm donor and be done with it?

What baffles me is the contradiction in their behavior. I would have thought a Mormon family would want more than one child, prioritize keeping the family together, and be staunchly against divorce. Instead, they’ve caused nothing but chaos, leaving me trying to make sense of it all. I have no idea if my ex is planning to go back to the church or if everything she said about leaving Mormonism was a lie. Are there people who fake leaving the church to meet someone, only to immediately go back after getting what they want?

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Any ideas why this happened? My ex refuses to talk about the past and threatens restraining orders when I try to ask about it, which makes it even harder to process. For what it’s worth, there was no fight, no ultimatum, no conversation about any of the issues she’s now claiming. Her and her parents simply put me through absolute hell, and I’m still shocked I’ve survived it so far.",5,1739660464.0,exmormon,2,0.86,False

1iqdx56,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/1iqdx56/so_frustrated_with_youtube/,So frustrated with YouTube,"I have been doing YouTube for 3 years now but have been creating content I LOVE for the last 18 or so months. Problem is nothing I seem to put out there ever gets any real traction and it really should. I am an animal crossing channel, and I know that niche is very crowded, but my content is very different from most ACNH channels. I parody famous movie trailers using Animal Crossing and all of it's many characters. Like three weeks ago I parodied the movie Groundhog Day (since it was upon us). Well to date that video has got 99 views. 99 views!!!!!! There are 20-minute speed build videos that get 20k views in like a day. Needless to say, I am super frustrated.

People always say that they want to see something different.  Well, my content is different from most, so what gives? My thumbnails are also fire, so I'm really at a loss to what I'm doing wrong. Some have said, ""well not everyone plays AC."" That just the thing, you don't have to play AC yourself. If you enjoy parody, you will most likely enjoy my channel.

Like I said I'm at a loss for what I'm doing wrong. I've tried cross promotion on other platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, reddit, etc. None of it ever made a difference, so I stopped. I reached out to other creators in my niche, but they ALL ignored me. I even bought one creator $20 in ""coffee,"" but she took my money and still refused to acknowledge me.

I feel so invisible on YouTube and that makes me very sad. I had modest success with my ""Barbie"" trailer. It was getting thousands of weeks a week, but then YouTube throttled it or something and now I'm lucky if it gets 5 views. 5 PER WEEK!

So, if there is any good Samaritan out there who's willing to give me some feedback on my channel, I would greatly appreciate it. (link in profile). I'm not asking for a handout, I just know now that having great content and great thumbnails doesn't matter. If it did, I would not be writing this post.

I just want to bring a little sunshine into this world via my channel. What's wrong with that?!! Thanks in advance!",0,1739660318.0,NewTubers,12,0.22,False
