1ginlne,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ginlne/lower_right_abdomen_pain_appendicitis/,"Lower right abdomen pain - Appendicitis, constipation, muscle strain? 28M","I know this is a common question here, but I‚Äôm on the fence about whether or not I‚Äôm experiencing early-stage appendicitis, or if I‚Äôm just a bit blocked up from travel and poor diet the last few days. 

On Friday I travelled to attend a concert that night (only a 2 hour drive), but as such picked up a pretty unhealthy dinner (fast food) before the concert. The concert was on the heavier side, and involved some head banging and dancing. We were in assigned seats so nothing too crazy, but I won‚Äôt rule out the possibility that I pulled/strained something. Also had three 12oz beers while attending. 

After the concert I was fine, and had some midnight leftovers. About 2-3 A.M. that night I began to have stomach pain, not sharp but enough to make me get up and try to go to the bathroom (to no avail), and eventually I was able to go back to sleep by sleeping primarily on my stomach. 

Next morning still had some dull pain, but just felt like there was nothing in my stomach. Had breakfast and a coffee with no changes, and was fine to drive the two hours back. 

Since then it‚Äôs just been a dull pain across my stomach, with an empty/crampy feeling near the bottom of my ribs and a pain point in the area between McBurney‚Äôs point and my hip. The area is generally like a 2-3 on the pain scale when untouched, and goes up to a 5 or so when pressed down. After releasing it doesn‚Äôt really hurt in that area anymore, and again just makes me feel like my stomach is incredibly empty. I was able to pass a small, soft stool this morning, but that has been the only one since Friday. 

These are the only symptom of Appendicitis that I have - pain in the lower right quadrant and constipation. No fever, no chills, no nausea, and I still have an appetite and have eaten a few times since the pain began. I‚Äôve tried some of the other at-home tests (Psoas/Obturator/Markle‚Äôs) but do not have any limited motion or real pain with any of these.

1ginl6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/1ginl6e/fraud_in_the_name_of_love/,Fraud in the name of love,"Note: I‚Äôm venting out. 

When I got divorced last year, it felt like I didn't lose my marriage; I lost everything. I have been 100% loyal, respectful to my wife, and always tried to be a son to my in-laws; after 8 years of marriage and a 5-year-old daughter, who would imagine that your childhood sweetheart would cheat on you and cheat on you with her college fling? I decided to end that relationship and fight for my daughter‚Äôs custody because I don't care who the biological father of that child is; she is my daughter and nothing else. 

Misery. I truly felt the meaning of that word. And that drove me to the alcohol, cigarettes, and everything that I always hated. Trust me, I could only sleep if I were fully drunk. It went on for a few months. At the peak of it, I would finish three boxes of Marlboro advanced cigarettes and two bottles of BlackDog whiskey every day. 

One fine day, one of my close friends took me to a dance bar in the Capitol Hotel, 321C. I hated it. I couldn't bear the sight of girls sitting in front of you like toys in a showcase, people throwing money at them, and those girls, for whatever their reasons, indulging in such vulgar activity. 


The next day, my ex-wife called in the evening and bashed the hell out of me for submitting evidence of her infidelity to the court. She was more upset that her family learned about her flings than anything else. After eight years of relationship, she didn't bother to ask how I was doing. It broke the hell out of me, and in the state of being drunk, I made the worst mistake of my life: I went to that bar again. It felt nice to make somebody dance on my fingertips for once. The alcohol stopped doing its job around 3 AM, and in the realization that I was making a mistake in being here, I rushed out in the middle of a song that I gave a girl to perform on. I apologized to her and the other managers there and sprinted away. 

The same day evening, a girl messaged me and asked me how I was. She might have requested as a courtesy, but be in my shoes, somebody asked how am I doing after a very long. I told her everything; a total stranger knew my life story. She showed empathy, tears, and care and shared her story of why she was there. For some reason, I connected with her. 

She asked me to meet her as a friend, and I agreed. It turns out that they are not allowed to go out and are put in cages. If you want to meet them, you‚Äôll have to give 1000 AED worth of collection to their daily dances. I went to that bar at 10 PM, sat there for 10 minutes, gave her a song, and wasted 1000 AED to meet her at 4 AM. God knows it was so lovely meeting with her. 

This became a daily routine, and 1000 AED increased to 1500 AED, 2000 AED, 4000 AED, and 7000 AED. Our one-hour meetings increased to three hours, six hours, and then an entire day. Friendship turned into a romantic relationship, and I was delighted. I didn't care about the money because (I thought) she cared for me. I cared for her every need, wish, family issue, demand, and desire. 

By the end of two months (last week), I told her that spending this much money daily doesn't make sense. Since I‚Äôm already separated, we should start living together, and once my divorce is finalized, we should get married. And that changed everything. She started ghosting me, ignoring me, stopped responding to my messages, and became a toxic person. 

Yesterday, I saw her with another man, holding hands, sipping coffee, and looking at him like she would look into my eyes while talking. I inquired and learned that I was just one more person she used to go out with and pretend to care about; there were three more guys like me. 

So here I am, fully drunk, feeling cheated on the name of love twice, venting out my story to strangers. Trust me, I would have ended my life if it was not for my daughter, but I will live for her and be the father that she deserves. ",1,1730642726.0,dubai,0,1.0,False

Software Got You Covered (Well, Maybe)","Alright, I get it‚ÄîAI isn‚Äôt for everyone. Some people love that artisanal, hand-crafted, human touch. Respect. But if you're a scrappy startup, small biz, or just trying to keep costs low, these AI tools can be your secret weapon. Not everyone has the budget for Hollywood-level production. But with these tools? You might not need one. Here‚Äôs the playbook for pro ads without the pro price tag:

---

üé¨ **Nail Every Shot with Storyboards**  
A solid ad starts with a clear vision. Before you roll camera, every shot, scene, and frame should be sketched out. That‚Äôs where [**PeakFiction**](https://www.makepeakfiction.com/) steps in. ‚úèÔ∏è Transform that napkin sketch into a full storyboard without needing a small army of artists. You‚Äôre in control of every frame‚Äîso when the camera rolls, you‚Äôre ready. Less ‚Äúuhh, what‚Äôs next?‚Äù and more ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go!‚Äù

‚úçÔ∏è **Crank Out the Script**  
Let‚Äôs be honest, writing ads is hard. If you‚Äôre not a Shakespeare in the making, why not let [**Copy.ai**](https://www.copy.ai/) and [**Jasper**](https://www.jasper.ai/) do the heavy lifting? They churn out catchy, on-brand scripts faster than you can say ‚Äúrevision requested.‚Äù

üé§ **Voice-Overs Without Breaking the Bank**  
Hiring voice actors can be pricey. Enter [**Murf.ai**](https://murf.ai/): they‚Äôve got a lineup of ultra-realistic voices ready to bring your script to life. It‚Äôs like having a pro voice actor in your pocket (minus the coffee breaks).

üéûÔ∏è **Edit Like a Pro**  
New to video editing? No sweat. [**Runway ML**](https://runwayml.com/) is your one-stop-shop for pro-level effects, color corrections, and scene cuts‚Äîwithout the Adobe price tag. Plug and play your way to slick, polished videos.

üìä **Target the Right Crowd, the Smart Way**  
Ads are useless if no one cares about them, right? That‚Äôs where [**HubSpot**](https://www.hubspot.com/) and [**Sprout Social**](https://sproutsocial.com/) come in. They‚Äôll help you zero in on your ideal audience so you‚Äôre not just shouting into the void. Smart ads, smart spend.

---

So yeah, AI isn‚Äôt for everyone, but if you‚Äôre looking to save a little cash and still make ads that look like they cost a fortune, it might be worth a shot. Worst case, you don‚Äôt like it, and you stick with the human touch. Best case? You just found a way to stretch your budget and up your ad game.",1,1730642637.0,u_Neither-Pilot6561,0,1.0,False

I keep getting told he‚Äôs just a rambunctious kid with a lot of energy, but I just have this gut feeling. My husband thinks I‚Äôm anxious due to my job. I‚Äôm just curious to know what your kiddos were like at that age. 

1. 85% of the day he is making noise. He is singing, humming, grinding his teeth, stomping his feet, etc. he won‚Äôt really do it when he‚Äôs watching tv or eating or sitting down to do an activity, though. he loves school, loves his teachers and adores his friends. But he‚Äôs been getting in trouble for being ‚Äúdisruptive‚Äù during circle time and story time. 

2. He is argumentative to the point where it feels like I have a 16 year old. Everything is back talk and ‚Äúbut why?‚Äù When angry he will still swat/swing at us and others. He wants what he wants. 

3. We are currently living with my MIL because our house is being built. She has two small dogs. I want to be clear that he is not unkind to the animals, he loves them. He is SO OVERSTIMULATED by them. He will chase them, laugh uncontrollably, pet them roughly constantly, jump around them, and just not leave them alone. No matter how many times we have told him the dogs do not want to play, he absolutely does not listen. 

3. I can‚Äôt even sit on the couch for 10 minutes to drink coffee without saying, ‚ÄúTommy (fake name) don‚Äôt do that! Tommy, put that down! Tommy, calm down!‚Äù His way of entertaining himself is just so destructive and mischievous. I‚Äôm so exhausted. He may play with his legos or toys for a few minutes but then it‚Äôs almost like he gets bored and is looking for the next thing/dopamine hit. 

4. He is incredibly smart, but He absolutely doesn‚Äôt listen. He‚Äôs very impulsive and his teacher has mentioned it already that it seems he has no control over his impulses. Everything is broken. It‚Äôs like once he‚Äôs done with his toys and is over it, he doesn‚Äôt care for them.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

I first posted my blood work results a couple of months ago and received a lot of helpful advice. I'm so grateful for all the comments; they made a huge difference for me.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1dxkaai/even\_doctor\_confused\_about\_my\_lab\_work\_high\_hdl/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1dxkaai/even_doctor_confused_about_my_lab_work_high_hdl/)

I just got my new bloodwork back, and my LDL has dropped from 188 to 102! Although my total cholesterol is still a bit high due to my elevated HDL, I feel confident that I'm on the right track. My A1c has also gone down, from 5.7 (borderline prediabetes) to 5.5, which is back in the normal range.

The entire process took about four months, but with three birthday party events and two vacations in that timeframe, my strict routine was closer to three months.



I‚Äôll check with my doctor about the elevated total bilirubin, though. Anyone know why it might be high**?**



**Main Diet:**

* Old-fashioned oatmeal with flaxseed
* Grilled chicken breast with seasoning
* Grilled salmon
* Fruits and Vegetables 
* One whole egg per day
* Coffee with milk (yes, I have this, although my husband follows the same routine without coffee, and his LDL dropped by 100!)
* No butter, no cheese, no pork‚Äîyes to beef (a couple of Shake Shack meals as cheat days)
* No desserts or cheesecake

**Snacks:**  
Roasted peanuts and roasted almonds (I didn‚Äôt measure portions, but I think measuring your intake could lead to even better results).

**Exercise:**  
None

  
**Side Effects:**

* Frequent bowel movements in the beginning 
* Weight loss and body fat reduction, skin sagging.
* Constant hunger at the beginning, not anymore.
* Difficult to exercise 

hope this helps. 

I‚Äôm over the moon about these results, and I‚Äôll continue maintaining this lifestyle for a while.

Horror Movies - Horror is life. Especially a lot of the older stuff. Not to say that new stuff can't be good too, though, because it certainly can. Recent obsession is the Terrifier series.

Music - I lean heavily towards rock and metal, but I'll listen to almost anything. Angus McSix is my favorite band, it's power metal. I'm always open to new suggestions.

Also a big (American) football fan, if anyone out there would like to talk about that.

I haven't started the carnivore specific diet as of yet, but I'm very much interested in doing so.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Some context/background for myself;**

* I'm currently doing Keto (originally for weight loss, but now to prevent seizures).
* Part of why I'm interested is to clear up possible skin and autoimmune issues (which might mean ditching dairy).
* I try to stick to ""what foods would be consumed naturally?"". 
* As it stands, my diet right now is mostly meat... and unsweetened dairy.
* I already don't eat many vegetables, since 99.9% of them give me issues.
* I very rarely eat any fruit; if I do, it's a handful of berries and nothing more.
* Other; I eat chocolate, drink tea and coffee, and I try to avoid sweeteners/sugar.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Anyway...

**""Why no eggs"", you ask?**   
Unfortunately, I was recently diagnosed with a rather strong allergy towards them. It's saddening. *I miss eggs*.

Currently my breakfast consists of; coffee+cream and a ¬Ω cup of plain, full-fat cottage cheese. As dietary requirements are individual, I've found that skipping breakfast - or just having coffee - really doesn't do it for me. Eating a lot of food in the mornings also doesn't settle very well.

I'm honestly clueless on what to eat that is both a.) Carnivore and b.) easy to eat, preferably without doing any cooking.  
I think, at this rate, I may have to simply heat up some leftovers (husband and I cook meat - and not much else - for dinner).

* The guy who realises his best friend/co-worker is going to a gay club. Let's call him Guy 1.
* The guy who goes to the gay club. Let's call him Guy 2.

==========

Castles Crumbling seems to be a generic ending for the end of organised religion in the Golden Age (Age of the overt supernatural on Earth üåç).

The events of Castles Crumbling are referenced in the story of the true love üíó couple.

¬†

# Background

¬†

As suspected in I Think He Knows, Guy 1 is part of the [family of cancer](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sarkhana/comments/1fu1hbz/family_of_cancer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). From his true parent(s), he inherits:

* Hyper-intelligence. This is why:
   * He manages to figure out Guy 2 is going to a gay club.
   * He acts so calm and rational about the situation e.g. realising he wants to have sexual feelings for Guy 2 as they would be a happy couple.
   * The love story happens at a rapid pace, without running around in circles, as Guy 1 gets his thoughts in order quickly. State of Grace/Holy Ground confirms they get together in the same night Guy 1 figures out Guy 2 is going to a gay club.
* Weak psychic power. He becomes fully psychic after his soul strengthens from the presence of true love üíó in I Think He Knows.

Guy 2 seems to be a dormant psychic as well. Explaining why he is so clever and why they get along so well.

He seems to also be family of cancer, from:

>Just twin fire signs

implying that they are born on similar dates. This likely means their cancer father visited the local area. He non-sexually impregnated their mothers with both of them while he was there.

This makes them siblings as far as souls are concerned. However, they are not biological üß¨ siblings, so it does not really matter much for incest. And they would not know they are related until many years after getting together.

However, they might share critical genes from when their souls were weaving their bodies together. These make up a small percentage of their genome üß¨. This is due to weak psychic experience transmission from their cancerous father. Including them having blue eyes.

This would mean they likely live in an area where blue eyes are rare, hence the commentary on it with:

>four blue eyes

This also means they likely bonded over their shared experience with having many twins, being hyper-intelligent, having a hateful personality, and having blue eyes.

==========

16th Avenue is a song about young boys leaving to the city üèôÔ∏è to make a career for themselves, with little possessions. It is referenced in I Think He Knows.

This means Guy 1 and Guy 2 left to the city for the metaphorical 16th Avenue when they were 17. They left with extremely minimal possessions. In a cheap second hand car and enough possessions to fit under their arms.

Guy 2 did it because he is gay ‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ôÇÔ∏è and his bio-parents are homophobic.

Guy 1 did it for unknown reasons. Presumably related to feeling trapped in the dreary life of his hometown.

They become co-workers and friends while starting off their career in the city.

==========

Guy 1 is religious/spiritual. He is more new age than dogmatic, believing in astrology and the potential of the Golden Age (Age of the overt supernatural on Earth üåç).

He is likely active in his church ‚õ™.

Since he is family of cancer, he is presumably a Christian of despair (religious person who does not have faith in the Heavens being benign). His beliefs are much darker than the norm. Even if other people assume they are more normal, including Guy 2.

==========

Guy 1 and Guy 2 are both stereotypically masculine, so assume the other is straight.

Guy 1 is also very religious/spiritual, so Guy 2 assumes he is straight or he would have more doubts about his faith üôè.

Guy 1 is likely so religious/spiritual because his weak psychic powers. They help him gain insight into supernatural matters.

==========

Guy 2 goes to the gay club every night. This fits with psychics and weak psychics generally being very horny in Taylor Swift songs. A side effect of the psychic power flowing within them.

1 day, their group of friends are having a dance e.g. at a night club. They are trying to get with the girls.

Guy 2 leaves, because he is gay ‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ôÇÔ∏è.

Guy 1 chases him, because he wants to convince Guy 2 to stay with him, because he loves his company.

Guy 2 insists he does not want to go.

Guy 1 is hyper-intelligent, so notices Guy 2 is not going in the direction of his apartment, so gets suspicious. He realises Guy 2 is going to a gay club and thus Guy 2 is gay ‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ôÇÔ∏è.

Guy 1 lets Guy 2 go. Presumably subtly implying he knows Guy 2 is gay now.

==========

Back with his friend group, Guy 1 realises he does not want to dance if Guy 2 is not there.

Guy 1 is hyper-intelligent. So he thinks very calmly and rationally about the new information that Guy 2 is gay. He thinks:

* this means Guy 2 is available sexually/romantically
* they would be very happy in a relationship together, due to how much they love each other's company as best friends
* he would be jealous if any guy got with Guy 2 instead of him, as that would mean less bonding time for the 2 best friends
* gets his thoughts in order extremely quickly, rather than running around in circles, making up his mind within the night time he realises Guy 2 is gay

so he begins to want to be sexually attracted to Guy 2.

Guy 1 then leaves and rushes towards the gay club he knows Guy 2 is going to. He presumably knew the location before and/or looked it up on his phone.

==========

Guy 1 enters the gay club dramatically, due to being in a rush. People presumably stare at him, making it a bit embarrassing, due to awkwardness.

He has to awkwardly go towards Guy 2 to greet him.

They start talking. Guy 2 explains how LGBT culture works to Guy 1. Guy 1 explains his religious/spiritual beliefs of despair to Guy 2.

Guy 1 gets alcohol üç∫ to try and draw out deep sexual desire, hoping to get overtly sexually attracted to Guy 2. Guy 2 is hyper-intelligent, so realises what Guy 1's plan is.

Guy 1 is new to self-aware same sex attraction, so has to think through how gay sex would mechanically work. And relationship dynamics without gender roles.

The 2 realise they have sexual and true love üíó desire for each other, without explicitly saying it, since they know each other so well.

==========

They talk until it gets very dark outside.

Eventually, they decide to leave, because of the time.

Guy 2 drives, because Guy 1 drank alcohol. Also, the best friends/co-workers want to have an excuse to go inside the same apartment to have sex.

In the dark of Guy 2's parking spot, they are even more open with each other, as no one is watching. They are not too forward to avoid backing each other into a corner.

Guy 1 smiles seductively and puts his hand on Guy 1's thigh to imply sexual attraction. Guy 2 does the same for Guy 1.

Guy 2 says ""So where we gonna go?"" hoping Guy 1 says for them to both to go back to his place, so they can have sex.

Guy 1 says ""where we gonna go?"" extremely seductively back to Guy 2. As an innuendo for going to bed together.

The best friends/co-workers kiss in the car.

They go back to Guy 1's apartment and have sex for the first time.

==========

The lovers sleep in Guy 1's bed together after sex.

When waking up, they presumably have sex again.

They understand each other well, so they know they love each other and want to move in together, despite never explicitly saying it.

Guy 1 skips to asking Guy 2 if he wants to go to Guy 2's apartment together to get his stuff and tell his landlord he is no longer a tenant.

Guy 2 agrees. They easily carry Guy 2's few possessions in their arms, as referenced in 16th Avenue. Even 1 of them alone could have done it, but they each other's company.

They leave a note for the landlord. It has an inside joke the lovers came up with.

==========

Due to the presence of true love üíó, the souls of Guy 1 and Guy 2 strengthen. Eventually making them fully psychic.

They use this power against Guy 2's homophobic parents and their cult/religion. They don't really feel guilty, as they are suck.

They do this subtly, so the religion thinks it fell apart for non-supernatural reasons. For example, making Guy 2's parents and the clergy go insane and unhinged ü§™. Thus, making them lose credibility and end up imprisoned/committed to a mental hospital.

This also means they become wealthy, due to things like Guy 2 inheriting his parent's wealth. Especially if they make them fall in insincere love with rich people and get married to them before.

The true love üíó couple keeps their relationship a secret from the public, while they do this, since they are happy even without people knowing.

==========

Due to both people psychic, they can:

* dance together while in separate rooms
* find each other in a crowd

since they can see through visual obstructions like walls and people's bodies.

==========

After the homophobic religions of the local area experience the events of Castles Crumbling, the area is accepting of LGBT people.

Time passes. There is going to be a Pride celebration. The lovers want to go, but only if they go together, making their relationship public.

The lovers wonder if the other feels sad about having to force LGBT acceptance the way they did. But they both realise they both find their actions good and holy.

They regret nothing. And don't even feel conflicted about it. They express this to each other.

==========

They dance together at the Pride celebrations and presumably kiss. This makes their relationship public knowledge.

At this point the local area is very LGBT accepting and has been for a long time. So they can show their love openly, without harming their social reputation.

==========

The title lyrics of State of Grace/Holy Ground are ironic. They reference the religiously taboo gay relationship in religiously sacred terms.

To show the real supernatural/goodness as opposed to the fantasy versions of them in pop-religion.

# Background of Castles Crumbling

¬†

# 

Organised religion is extremely hard to maintain as Earth becomes increasingly filled with overtly supernatural beings and events.

This is because:

* Organised religion is often hostile towards groups/institutions without real reason. For example:
   * LGBT people
   * nations with different cultures
   * scientific üß™ progress into taboo areas
   * legal reform
   * world unity
* Many members are bad people. Especially the people with the most power and authority. So psychics will not feel bad about:
   * killing them
   * overtaking their bodies
   * stealing from them, strangling the religion of its funding
   * making members fall in insincere love to gain the monetary benefits of marriage
* so are likely to do so if they feel like it would benefit them.
* Secrets are likely to get spilled, since psychics can see through walls. This is harmful to organised religion, as it relies on its members trusting each other, often with blind faith. It is really hard to maintain a large organised religion without faith in humanity.
* The bizarre events are likely to make humans decide to reform.
* They are really bad at dealing with genuine supernatural events, since they cling to dogma, rather than reacting to the evidence
* They are really bad at explaining supernatural events, even though that is supposed to be the point of them. So people are going to wonder what the point is, if it cannot do the 1 thing it was built for right.
* The members are likely to believe their cult/religion is validated by the events, even if that is nonsensical, due to confirmation bias. Then cling onto their false beliefs even harder, making them increasingly unhinged and insane, as they become increasingly disconnected from reality.
* They are easy to manipulate, so they can be exploited for ends such as:
   * building buildings in a specific place, so a dream home can be built without having to put all the effort into building/planning it yourself
   * raising the children of others
   * giving an excuse to move people around
   * covering up crimes/taboo actions
* They are extremely fragile to system collapse, as their parts are so specialised. Especially by cutting off their income üí∞ to finance their activities.

Castles Crumbling has 2 generic narrators. They are

* 1 for the clergy
* 1 for lay people

These 2 represent people who cling onto organised religion strongly, even when it is obvious their organised religion is falling apart.

It narrators seem to be flawed, but have very minor redeeming traits. This is because:

* they are not dead, overtaken, or imprisoned
* they realise they are at fault

So there is the upside for them that they can reform to be better.

1gin5ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1gin5ks/returnupgrade_delonghi_magnifica_evo/,Return/Upgrade delonghi magnifica evo?,"My husband and I purchased our first super automatic a couple weeks ago. We went with the delonghi magnifica evo because of the positive reviews, our typical coffee drinking needs, and the price point. My husband typically drinks black coffee/straight espresso. I drink coffee with cream every morning and enjoy occasional ‚Äúfun‚Äù drinks like lattes and cappuccinos. We‚Äôre in the middle of a full (aka expensive) kitchen reno so we‚Äôre not looking to spend tons of money on a machine. My husband is especially concerned about the price given our ‚Äúbasic‚Äù coffee habits. 

So far, we‚Äôre really enjoying the magnifica evo (after figuring out the grind setting issue we experienced last weekend). However, I‚Äôm now wondering if I should return the evo and upgrade to a different machine that has more drink options. I enjoy a larger cup of coffee in the morning and I find I have to make two coffees in a row to fill my cup. It‚Äôs not a huge deal, but I wonder if I would do better with a machine that has options for long blacks and flat whites‚Ä¶or can I make similar drinks by playing around with the evo?

1gin5ie,https://www.reddit.com/r/FA30plus/comments/1gin5ie/i_sometimes_wonder_if_the_problem_isnt_that_women/,"I sometimes wonder if the problem isn't that women don't like me, but that I don't like women enough","As I've gotten older I've spent more time thinking about why I'm FA and one of the things that I believe has caused me the biggest problem is not following the rituals and social norms surrounding dating. I've never asked a woman out on a date, never pursued anyone, never downloaded a dating app. I always felt that those things were almost ""beyond"" me in some vague way, but actually thinking about it, I've realised they're not beyond me, I've just never felt like doing them. 

I'm not asexual or aromantic, I feel sexual attraction to women and desire sex and romance. I'm not some miserable shut in either, I have no problem organising trips with friends, treating them to a meal or a coffee, I'll invite them round my place and cook for them and so on, but these are people I have an established relationship with, I can't understand why  I would do those things with a woman I don't. 

I began to wonder if the problem is simply that I have never liked a woman enough, but that falls apart when I ask myself, why would I like a woman I don't know? Do men who approach and chase women really like these women more than me or do they just find the prospect of access to sex and romance a big enough motivator for them to perform the ritual? Looking from the outside in, it seems the whole system hinges on male lust more than anything else.

All this isn't to say I've never had romantic feelings for any woman, but it has been very few, you could count them on one hand and have a finger to spare. They were good friends and I had no reason to believe they felt the same way about me, so pursuing a relationship felt like throwing away a friendship. I think, ultimately, my problem has been that I don't like women, in an abstract sense, enough.

Now I'm looking to move on from that machine, to a dual boiler (either the Sage dual boiler or the Rancilio silvia pro x are what I'm keeping my eye on), and I want to start taking water seriously, both to prolong the life of my machine through minimal descaling, and to make sure I'm getting the best tasting coffees.

I've spent a lot of time researching what water recipes to add to distilled water, and I've come across the Dr Pavlis recipe (using Potassium Bicarbonate) and the different recipes from Barista Hustle (using Epsom Salts and sodium bicarbonate), however, I'm a bit confused as to how the different recipes and different minerals used will affect the taste and was wondering if one of you could explain how the different minerals change things.

My point is that unless you have an espresso machine, instant coffee is cheaper, less messy, less time consuming and requires zero maintenance besides washing the cup and decalcifying the kettle (if you live in a hard water area), which you would have had to do anyway. It also produces less unrecyclable waste than espresso machines - and you would still have to clean the espresso machine out every so often. Instant just seems to be a go-to choice for people with busy lives and those who are bad at cleaning and maintenance.

On the first date, he shared that he was getting out of a recent-ish LTR and didn‚Äôt want to jump into a relationship soon. I was cool with that because I was just trying out the dating world for the first time and I‚Äôve also grieved a LTR. 
After a few more dates, my anxiety spiked around his ex since they have a shared owned condo (he doesn‚Äôt live there anymore, she does) and he still invests financially in that property and stays at the property when she‚Äôs out of town to take care of it and also as an excuse to be in town and hang with his friends/community (and me!) (post break-up he moved out of town and away from his community). We decided it was too triggering for me, and he wasn‚Äôt far along enough in the grieving process, and that we should just be friends. 
Since then, we‚Äôve grown into a really nice friendship. We‚Äôve hung out a few times, strictly platonically, over the past few months, and we continue to chat every day (some texting throughout our days, some phone calls during the month). I‚Äôve truly enjoyed our friendship and it feels very wholesome (we encourage each other, chat about silly things, explore deeper topics, and give each other advice). I‚Äôve had to work through some more hopeful-romantic feelings I had for him, but when I put things in perspective (and communicate with him) I am able to see him for who he is, and where he‚Äôs at, and it‚Äôs not a place I need him to be to enter into a relationship. We continue to check-in about what this friendship means to us (it‚Äôs important to both of us), and what we both need it to be (platonic with honesty and boundaries). 
Anyway, latest update is I just saw him recently and we had a great time over coffee (he did not stay at the house, he stayed with some friends), but he hasn‚Äôt reached out in a few days which is so bizarre (he did send a ‚Äúhope your day has been going well!‚Äù) after literally talking every. single. day. since summer. Just last week he was sending me videos from his bowling league‚Äôs games, as per usual. How should I interpret this? On one hand, I think it is a little much that we talk every day while not dating (how sustainable is that?), on the other hand, I miss hearing from him and connecting. Of course I know I should communicate this with him, which I will. Just wanted to gather some insight first. Thanks in advance! 

TL;DR: guy and I have been texting every single day since this summer and have gone from dating prospects to a solely platonic friendship because he is still grieving his ex. We connect on just about everything- our days, our feelings, goals, etc. He just stopped texting a few days ago out of the blue. What can this mean? ",1,1730640796.0,dating,1,1.0,False

We both had so much love for each other, but there was one thing that kept driving us apart, his excessive going out and drinking while going out. A year of living together opened my eyes to the magnitude of how often he would go, the hours of no contact all through the night into the next morning, and a handful of occasions where he would drive home drunk (which is a handful too many). 

We would discuss it over and over, how he was endangering others and himself, how my trust of him going out was dwindling, and how I didn't think his friends were good influences on him in this respect. But it didn't compute for him. He wouldn't compromise with me at all. The final straw was when he strolled in nonchalantly at 5:30 am while I'm having my coffee, went straight to the bedroom reeking of alcohol, and passed out. 

I asked him to leave that morning and he did. I couldn't take the blatant disrespect for himself and for me. We talked and talked about working it out, how he could see it was harmful behavior to himself and our relationship. But eventually he decided he didn't want to give it up or compromise at all. 

These last 2 months have been agony for me. My dream man just gone in an instant. The one man on this earth that has ever truly accepted me for me and loved me so much. He even says I'm his dream woman and perfect in every way. But because he doesn't want to cut back on partying every weekend, he gave our relationship all up. I'm truly in shock that he prioritized that over a full loving relationship.

It truly does feel like I will be alone forever at this point. I feel worthless. Like dumped trash. I'm not worth fighting for or working for.

1gimt95,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WoodenAd1628/comments/1gimt95/the_history_of_mexico/,THE HISTORY OF MEXICO,"For those who don't know at all, Mexico is a huge state in the south of North America. Mexico's two northern geographical neighbors, the United States and Canada, are historically infants compared to the country of cacti and corn. Of course, the modern state of Mexico is also young, even younger than the United States, but its culture goes back centuries.

Back in 2 thousand BC (contemporaries of Ancient China, India and Babylonia), the Olmecs lived on the territory of modern Mexico ‚Äì ""people from the country of rubber trees."" These cool American peppers invented ideographic writing, the solar calendar, the ""long count"" system, were among the first farmers on the planet, built pyramids (no worse than Egyptian ones), carved huge human heads out of stone, and in between the accomplishment of great deeds played ball (the sacred game was called ""tlachtli"").

At a time when Rome flourished and played the box in the Mediterranean, the Olmecs were replaced by the Maya, the so-called ""classical era"" began in Mexico, although formally the Stone Age continued. By the year 500 (in Europe at that time ‚Äì the early, wildest Middle Ages, and the beginning of the era of ""barbarian kingdoms""), the Maya created their ""superpower"" and built the grandiose city of Teotihuacan, which for many centuries became the cultural and religious center of Mesoamerica.

The Maya cultivated corn, wheat, cotton, coffee, chocolate, tobacco, sugar cane, obtained rubber, erected monumental temples of the Moon and Sun, created original sculptures and frescoes, but did not know iron. Having built a great civilization, like all normal people, the Maya began to wet each other and by the beginning of the 2nd millennium AD and got involved in the era of massive strife. The former power could not be returned.

From the XIII-XIV centuries. the palm tree in Mesoamerica passed to a conglomerate of tribes that we know as the Aztecs. These guys dominated the region until the arrival of the conquistadors at the beginning of the XVI century.

Considering that they were no worse than the Olmecs and Maya, the Aztecs also created a great empire with a population of 15 million and the majestic capital of Tenochtitlan. The Aztec Empire was a typical military despotism: the subordinate cities of Mesoamerica paid tribute to the center, for which they received an armed roof and ""management"".

It is characteristic that the only people who defeated the Aztecs and did not obey them were some Purepecha, the main producers of copper axes in the region. (Even then, the Aztecs should have taken care of more significant investments in the military-industrial complex, but ... no).

Borrowing a lot from their predecessors, the Aztecs also created an original civilization (let me remind you all this ‚Äì the late Stone Age and the era of early copper). So, to improve the management system, the Aztecs built a fairly decent road system, although they preferred pedestrian ecotransport (they did not have draft animals and wheeled vehicles). Education, medicine, magic, crafts, and trade developed.

Channels of vertical mobility in Aztec society are interesting: some gifted children were sent to song and dance houses, and others to a ball game house (well, nothing changes in this world!). According to the internal structure, the Aztec society resembled the societies of the Ancient East: there were nobles (""pilli"") and all the rest, ""people"" (""maceualli""). The aristocrats came from military circles. Especially experienced warriors (who captured 4-5 slaves in the war) were ranked as a Jaguar or Eagle.

Like all self-respecting despotists, by the end of its existence, the Aztec empire began to go a little crazy. Human sacrifices and the so-called ""flower wars"" - wars between cities in order to capture slaves for sacrifices - began to be practiced more widely. Later, the Aztecs believed that the sun, smeared with human blood, moves better in the sky.

All this fun ended at the beginning of the XVI century, when aggressive and gold-hungry guys appeared in Mesoamerica under the leadership of Hernan Cortez. There were critically few Spanish conquistadors, but they were wearing vests (in armor). And with muskets. And with guns. Well, you understand how it ended.

In a matter of years, organized criminal groups sailing from overseas defeated the Aztec civilization and turned it into part of the Spanish Empire. The viceroy and the audience took the place of the emperor, and gloomy Catholic monks replaced the priests with their solar-lunar cults. The colonial period began.

New Spain (a huge region that included Mexico) became Spain's richest overseas colony. Forced labor was introduced for the local population in mines or agriculture, black slaves began to be imported from Africa through Jamaica, and Mexican goods flowed into Europe in a generous river.

In order for the local population and mestizos not to think about any nonsense like civil rights and freedom, the Catholic Church and the Inquisition worked hard to control their minds.

However, nothing lasts forever under the moon. At the beginning of the 19th century, serious problems began in Spain itself, and New Mexico rebelled. After a 10-year massacre with the metropolis, Mexico became the first of all Latin American countries to become independent.

The 19th century passed for Mexico in endless internal conflicts between the aristocracy and the common people, reformers and conservatives, supporters of Spain and ""patriots"". The republic was replaced by the dictatorship of another caudillo leader, foreign intervention by partisanship and a surge of national feelings.

However, by the middle of the century, Mexico had almost halved, ceding the northern territories (Texas, California, Utah, Nevada, etc.) in favor of the United States.

In the same XIX century, several new sustainable features of Mexico's development appeared (they are still relevant today): a penchant for authoritarianism, the enormous influence of mafia clans and the brutality with which internal strife is conducted.

Needless to say, revolutions, riots and civil strife in the turbulent twentieth century demolished more than one thousand hot Mexican heads?! Today's Mexico is a big country with huge development potential, although it is better known as the largest supplier of cocaine and illegal migrants to the United States.

At the same time, Mexico is a country of amazing contrasts and discoveries, delicious cuisine and incendiary music, beautiful women and hot freedom‚Äìloving men. Just look at what Mexico has given the world. Chocolate, corn, tobacco, sunflower, avocado, potatoes, tomatoes, beans, pumpkin, tequila, vanilla, rubber, gum, ficus paper, calendar, knowledge of mathematics, astronomy, architecture, medicine, pharmacology.

And Mexico, these are outstanding people - artists Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, actors Anthony Quinn and Dolores del Rio, Nobel laureates Mario Molina and Alfonso Robles, musicians Consuelo Velasquez and Juventino Rosas. And Hollywood actors and singers of Mexican origin simply cannot be counted!

Mexico is a land where sea and land, the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the cultures of the ancient Maya and medieval Catholic Europe meet. Mexico is a country that you definitely need to visit!

1gimsgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gimsgw/feeling_a_bit_lost_over_a_girl/,Feeling a bit lost over a girl,"Half a year ago I moved to Norway. Got a nice job offer here and basically thought it'd be a nice place to start anew. I was in a long-term relationship of +4 years and, for a long time, it just wasn't making it for me. I was feeling really depressed and isolated, lots of crap that had accumulated over the years were taking a toll on me and overall I couldn't think of a healthy future where me and my ex could coexist. 

Yeah, I did a lot of bad stuff, I developed a gambling addiction, I was probably watching way too much porn and also drinking way more than I was used to. I know I was trying to cope with the way my life was at that point. I felt that I was a failure in many ways. I was burnt out from university, my job was a joke, and there were no tangible options to find a more suitable job in my country, even though I have a solid academic background in my field. Several times I felt bullied or put down by my ex's family, and several times she used me as some sort of buffer between her and whatever anyone demanded from her. 

We sort of broke up at the end of May and I felt some closure, everything was clear in my head and the distance helped. Maybe I wouldn't have had the courage to finish things if I was back in my country.

From that point, my love life has been a bit too crazy. I'm used to long-term relationships. And now that I'm back on the dating scene everything is a bit chaotic for me. 

During the summer, I had two brief flings (no sex, tho). For many reasons, they didn't work out, but I got a bit attached and hurt after they ended. 

Recently, I was in between jobs and briefly moved to Oslo, where I met a girl that basically fulfilled my every need. We talked for about a month, she invited me to her place and she was everything that I'd expected and way more. Beautiful, smart, ambitious, quirky and really mature. The only problem was that she wasn't over her ex, that lives in NYC, where she did some sort of internship when they met. They only dated briefly (half a year) and when they did, she wasn't over her previous ex (that she dated for a year). She was dumped by both and now she feels guilty because she was still into her ex when she was with this last guy. And kinda ignores that the distance wouldn't allow for them to be together anyway. She keeps on talking with this guy, mostly arguing, but has a really nice opinion of him and holds him to high standards. I don't care about the guy, I don't even know him.

Anyway, that didn't prevent her from having the most intense sex that I've ever experienced in my life and all the cuddling, etc. Last Wednesday, I went to her place and everything was okay. I felt she was a bit sadder than usual and she told me before that she had an argument with her ex. I went there to comfort her a bit and brought some food with me. We slept together and I was not even supposed to spend a night there. Up to a point, she was really needy, pushing me next to her and basically asking me for cuddles. But after a while, her mind drifted and I noticed she was thinking about something else and we went to sleep. 

In the morning, she said that maybe we should stop seeing each other because she keeps thinking about someone else. We had planned to spend last Saturday together and I was planning a really nice dinner by candlelight (yeah, I know, lame). I told her to think about it since I'm about to move elsewhere for work, and she will have some time to heal and make up her mind about her ex and about me. We had coffee together and a really nice talk while going to the city center before we parted ways. 

After a while, she messaged me saying she enjoyed the talking with me in the morning, and our little walk, and that she will have dinner with me Saturday. We kept on talking and Friday I kinda pushed her into a corner because she was being really cryptic with some messages saying that we should see more people and not being too invested in only one person, etc. She told me that she needed to follow her intuition and not meet up with me last Saturday. I felt really hurt, and still am, but I really like her and believe she's the one for me, despite all the ex bs.

She went out with some friends and posted some pictures in her stories, but nothing really out of the ordinary. We're not exclusive and she was always really open about keeping things casual. I was the first guy she met after the breakup and the same thing goes for me (when it comes to the sex part), and I'm not worried about with whomever she sleeps with. 

I'm going to be away for some time and soon she will also go back to northern Norway to spend the Christmas vacations with her family, so I can only probably be with her in the beginning of December before she leaves. She also told me that meeting frequently stressed her out a bit, but she was the one initiating it.

I just want to know if it's worth doing some chasing. She's not over her ex yet, but I believe she might be after things settle a little bit in her life. I'm also a bit financially unstable right now and she has some expensive tastes (vinyl records, wine, good food, etc.), but I believe she's worth it. I've been completely head over heels for her and it's killing me. 

Maybe the distance will give me some clarity on this, but I can't avoid thinking that my shot at happiness is being frustrated because of some random guy in NYC that doesn't even care about this girl. And I know I can make her happy. ",0,1730640369.0,dating,1,0.5,False

I absolutely love music - whether it's playing guitar, spinning vinyl (I love collecting and listening to records), or going to concerts. It'd be great to find a more concert friends! Let me know what upcoming concerts you're going to! I also love spending time outside with my dog. He's got a cute outdoorsy name but you'll have to message me to find out what it is haha.

I don't have to work until 9:00 AM most days and I get up early and usually just listen to one side of a record before heading to work.

1gimq64,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1gimq64/just_finished_my_first_royal_caribbean_cruise/,"Just finished my first Royal Caribbean cruise, after cruising with Carnival for a while. ","Hey all, just found the sub, thought I'd put in my 2 cents. BTW, thanks for   keeping me safe from words that have the letters S,O, and R grouped together in a certain order. üòÜ This is of course all my own opinions, which you are perfectly fine to disagree with. We're just got back to Galveston after 7 days on the Harmony of the Seas. I've done a dozen or so Carnival cruises, mostly Caribbean,  but I've done Alaska and West coast Mexico too.  My wife did RC once before on a girl's trip and enjoyed it. She books all our travel, so away we went. Honestly,  Carnival seems to have gone downhill a bit in the last few years, and this was a nice change.  Here's what I enjoyed:

Ship coffee‚úÖÔ∏è - I enjoy a good black coffee, and Carnival's always tasted like mud. Regular RC coffee is good stuff. They also have a full selection of tea available everywhere coffee is, which is nice. Carnival basically only has Lipton. 
Shows‚úÖÔ∏è The evening shows are far superior to anything I've seen on Carnival.  Production value and variety are top notch. The Fine Line water show in particular was amazing. 
Central Park‚úÖÔ∏è what a nice place to spend time.  Usually quiet, the garden is beautiful.
Adult area(Solarium)‚úÖÔ∏è: way better than Serenity on just about any Carnival ship I was on. Bigger, better layout,  more seating, and the hot tubs were open late. They always seem to close Serenity for some baloney reason on Carnival. 
Room‚úÖÔ∏è we had an interior 'virtual balcony' room(a big tv with an outside live feed). No complaints. Good bed, lots of room for putting stuff away, nice little couch. Good setup.
Refreshment package‚úÖÔ∏è We're not big drinkers, so we opted for the Refreshment package, which gives you basically everything but branded Starbucks items and alcohol.  I like this a lot better than Carnival's option, which is basically everything or soda only. The alcohol package on RC is flex-priced based on cruise demand and season, and was way too much for our cruise (over $100 per guest per day, which would have almost doubled the total price). 

Here's some stuff that was generally good, but I was mixed about.

Food!  Generally I found the food to be a little better than Carnival.  MDR is a little more formal, with full place settings and linens every night. No singing or dancing. We didn't try much premium dining,  as we felt it was too expensive.  We splurged and tried the Mexican place for lunch one day, and it was pretty good. Still, $35 a head for lunch is still pretty pricey in my opinion.  We also tried the sushi, and it was quite good, with indivdual dishes as an option.  Please keep in mind we're Canadian,  so everything is 35% more for us.  Lots of options elsewhere though. They have a pizza place, a hot dog stand, a Starbucks, a caf√© with little bites open 24 hrs, a mini buffet with build-your-own tacos and nachos, a 'health-food' small-plates place, a deli with soup and sandwiches, and of course a huge buffet.  I'm probably missing something,  but it's easy to find something you like.  The buffet was good, lots of choices, often very similar to the MDR food.  They also have a full bar, with specialty coffee, right in the buffet area, which I haven't seen on a Carnival ship.
Here's where Carnival has the edge in my opinion.   Guy's burgers,  the Blue Iguana,  and the Deli. No burger on RC comes close to Guy's.  They have a burger place called Johnny Rockets, but it's 15 bucks a head. I honestly didn't try it though, but looking in i didn't see anything impressive.  Also, there's nothing better in the morning than a fully loaded Blue Iguana breakfast burrito,  and I'll fight about it.  The Carnival deli seems more 'traditional' I guess, with more sandwich options, made fresh.  The RC deli has pre-made sandwiches they throw in a pannini press.  I also like that Carnival has specialty dining options for lunch, for no extra charge.  That might change though.

Ship Layout- The good: First thing, this ship is big. Lots of walking. But, big ship means lots of activities.  Tons of stuff to do for kids. Lots of pools and hot tubs.  Lots of seating on the top decks. Lots of bars. And even though there's like 6500 guests, I always managed to find a quiet spot.  It's a nicer ship in general,  as I find some of Carnival's decor to be a little cheesy.  The way the rooms are laid out is different than Carnival, instead of even and odd sides, they have different a series of numbers on each side.  No big deal once you figure it out.  I also like the fact you're never 'stuck' on one side of the ship, blocked by the galley, like you are on a lot of Carnival ships. 
The not so good:  Deck 5/6 is a very busy area, with a lot of things going on. They have big parties there, presentations, shopping, piano bar, bands, pictures,  all kinds of stuff. That's also where the caf√© and pizza place are, and if you're just trying to get there and grab a late snack,  it can be annoying. The noise tends to carry all the way up to the higher decks, too. Can't hear it in the room though.  
Buffet layout- the good: once you're in there and have your food, and found a table, it's good. Like I said, decent food, lots of options.  Not a lot of bottlenecks, and they give you a buzzer while you wait for fresh omelets, which is a common choke point on Carnival.  
The not so good: getting a table during peak times can be a challenge.  Some of the tables are hard to access when it's busy and there's scooters everywhere.  They can also have big line ups to get in, as they funnel everyone through a hand-washing station,  which is not a necessarily a bad thing, but certainly slows things down.

Now, stuff I didn't like much at all: 
Reservation system:‚ùåÔ∏è most of the shows and evening entertainment have a reservation system through the app.  There's a limited number of slots for each show, and you have to be quick.  Every show has two lines, reservations or no reservations.  They open the venue usually 45 minutes early for reservation holders, but seats are still a free-for-all, so it's still a rush to get in. Then everyone else has to stand there until 10 minutes before start of show, and then it's a huge rush to try to get a seat. I much prefer Carnival's setup. Venue opens way early,  you get a seat, hang out with a drink, and chill until the show starts. 
MyTime dining in the MDR: ‚ùåÔ∏è dumb setup. It's not really MyTime at all.  It works off the same reservation system as the shows. You have to book the times way ahead, and if the slot you want isn't available,  tough. You have to wait in the 'no reservation' line, which can be very long during peak times. Carnival has a great system. When you're thinking about going for dinner, hit 'book a table' on the app, and when it's ready, you get a cheerful notification and head on down. No lineups. With RC, you basically have to plan all your evenings out ahead of time, or be prepared to stand around.  
Shower soap ‚ùåÔ∏è This is probably dumb, but the but the 3-in-1 soap in the shower sucks. I'm an old bald guy, and none too picky about what I wash with. That stuff wouldn't lather on a bet. Smells ok though. 
Activities during the day‚ùåÔ∏è There's really not much to do between breakfast and dinner, especially on port days. Like nothing.  There's a little trivia, and bands of course if you're into that, but if you don't gamble, drink, shop, or do yoga, you're pretty much stuck sitting around reading or whatever.  The people watching is good in the busy areas though. 

Final thoughts: I had a good time.  The staff were great, the ship was clean, with a lot of emphasis on cleaning high-touch areas and bathrooms.  Dishes seemed to sit around in low traffic areas,  but that's a minor quibble.  Was it miles better than Carnival?  No, but I think overall the experience was better, at a similar price point.  Travel is so expensive,  and I think it's important to get the most for your money.

1gimq4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gimq4n/girlfriend_frustrated_with_me/,Girlfriend frustrated with me.,"Me and my girlfriend have had a recurring issue. She gets incredibly mad and disappointed at me when I fall asleep regardless of she is going through something. 
For more context, I currently have to wake up at 5am monday through Saturday, there is so much overtime mandatory at work. I work a blue collar job, so often times I am legitimately exhausted by the time the week is close to being over. 
I also go to school and we are both artist so we usually are working a project together. She works one weekend per month, and picks up random shifts at her part time job. 
This week we had some deadlines and we moved into a new house, hence I have been going to bed around 11pm to 1am everyday! I am so sleep deprived, I am drinking coffee and redbulls at work just to be able to function properly, I get home and we spend quality time together we go out and eat, cook together or watch a movie. 
But I tell her that it is taking a toll on me. 
Last night she was super sad about a lot of things going on in her personal life. we cuddled and I asked her what was wrong and I tried to be present for her sadness, but I could not help to start snoozing as the night went by and this makes her feel like I do not care about her feelings. She told me I only think about myself because I fall asleep even if she is crying her eyes out, and I try to explain that I am so tired is not in my control to start falling asleep when we are already in bed. 
She told me that ‚ÄúIf you wanted, you would‚Äù in speaking about me staying up to soothe her sadness and be present for her while she cries next to me, the argument being that if I am able to stay up until 11 or 1 am other days for stuff we have to do, I can do so for her in nights like last night. 
I try to tell her that is like driving while sleepy, no matter how hard you try is super hard to fight it, rolling down your windows and eating seeds and all that you still feel sleepy! 
Yesterday as she was crying I cracked and told her I felt like I was going insane, I needed to sleep!  and that I felt like no matter how much I try to explain to her the feeling of exhaustion she cannot empathize at all. I turned around and try to sleep, she said I make everything about me and that I am selfish and left to sleep on the couch. I wanted to stop her and talk things out, but I fell asleep immediately. 
Today she woke up got ready and left without saying anything. 
AITAH? Am i being selfish or a psychopath for not reacting appropriately to my partner that I love being sad and crying at night? By the way this crying thing has only happened like twice in the last year and it is not related to our relationship, but her family and friends. ",1,1730640155.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False
1gimppq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gimppq/my_husband_is_too_perfect_is_this_normal/,My husband is too perfect. Is this normal? ,"My husband (28M) and I (26F) got married 9 months ago and we've been together 3 years. 

I see a lot of ""my boyfriend/husband/partner sucks"" kind of content online (especially after moving in together), but I wonder is this is an overrepresentation of the worst men. It got me thinking, is my husband really that out of the ordinary? Or is he one of many many great husbands out there under the radar because the great husband content doesn't get as many views as the rants about the incompetent ones?

So I'm listing out some of the things my husband does and I would love to know if your husband/partner is similar. If yes, please share some of the great things your husband does! And if my husband really is that special, let me know so I can give him a longer hug today. 

I focused this list around the topics people rant about the most online. Things like weaponized incompetence, mental load, not being proactive, etc. Also would like to add that he's never done house chores growing up and he's not a neat freak or a cleaning enthusiast. He learned to do everything he does for me.

1. He wakes up at 5 AM every morning to make me breakfast and always does the dishes before he leaves for work. 

2. He cleans nonobvious things without me ever asking him to. I'll just randomly notice that the crust in the air fryer is gone or that the stains in the coffee machine are wiped or that the microwave is sparkly or that the oven racks were scrubbed. When he notices stuff getting grubby, he'll just clean it so that I don't have to. 

3. He'll randomly do my laundry for me just because. Sometimes, I go to my room and see all my clothes folded up on my bed.

4. I haven't touched my cat's litter box once since we started living together. He insists on doing the ""dirty chores"". 

5. He cooks or bakes anything and everything I mention I like. He learned how to make macarons, kouign amanns, croissants, cake, matcha cookies, and he's currently on a sourdough bread journey because of my sensitive stomach. He cooks everything from steak to ratatouille just because I'm craving it. 

At this point, you might be wondering if I even do anything. I do! But if I start vacuuming our rooms, he doesn't just sit there. He starts scrubbing down the kitchen and mopping the floors. If I pick up a dish sponge, he tells me to go watch a youtube video while he takes over. If I'm cooking us dinner when he gets home from work (which happens often since I get off earlier than him), he drops his things at the door, runs over to give me a hug, and tells me how much he appreciates me cooking for him after work. He does this everyday and acts like it's the first time. I never feel like he takes me for granted.  

House stuff aside, he puts me first no matter what. He'll drop everything and drive me 4 hours to NYC just because I said I want L'Industrie pizza. He never raises his voice at me or blames me for anything, even when I'm clearly in the wrong. He plans all of our dates. He tells me I'm sexy, kind, cute, talented, amazing countless times throughout the day. He's also very sentimental. I've gotten him expensive gifts, but to this day he always says his favorite gift is the photo album of us that I made for him on our first anniversary. He cried when he got it, and always talks about how much he loves that thing. 

I used to think this wouldn't last. But if anything, he's become so much more proactive over the months. But I guess even if he does slack off in the future, I'll still be grateful for how much he's done for me. 

I know I'm blessed, but at the same time, I wonder how many husbands out there are equally as sweet and amazing and don't get praised as much as the bad ones get scrutinized. Let me know your thoughts!

TL;DR, My husband is amazing and I wonder if he really is that special or if this is the norm for husbands and it just doesn't get talked about as often online. ",0,1730640121.0,relationships,13,0.45,False

1gimoh3,https://i.redd.it/igla5xlatoyd1.jpeg,What if Moxx's calculation were right ?,"At the start of S2ep10, we can see Moxxie struggling with bankruptcy, most likely due to the insane amount of things blitz bought.

At the end of the episode, we can see Moxxie, blissed over the fact he finally solved this bankruptcy problem, but Loona comes around and says ""you forgot to carry the two"".

Moxxie then almost sets fire to his office but Loona gave him ice cream and laid him in front of a tv.

Maybe Moxxie was right ? Loona (as we know it for now) never went to school, she was in a hellhound adoption centre or in the streets for most of her life before she was adopted, so how is she able to do math, I know carrying a two is easy, but we don't have any proofs that she had any education.

Another detail is that she stayed up all night burning taxidermied owls, then how did she do math after not sleeping for a whole night, and having just three coffees as an energy source?

Or maybe someone just taught her the basic, and that would seem logical, but in the pilot, a really good theory is that she lied about the kid being the target just because she didn't like him (I know the pilot's non canonical but a lot of the character's traits stayed, so maybe this works ?), she could have lied here, or just wanted to joke him

Maybe all of this is crazy and she took a nap before doing basic maths, I don't know.

What do y'all think ?

1gimogh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gimogh/aitah_for_taking_my_car_to_work/,AITAH for taking my car to work?,Story time lol. I (39m) have 2 vehicles one suv and a sports car (manual). My wife works at the same place i do. And her adult kids live at home with us. One of them works a dead end job and the other doesnt work at all but does help watch my son when me and my wife are both at work. I took my suv to work this morning and (they get coffee from one place every morning) couldnt go get their coffee because i took the vehicle that they could drive (but barely do because it needs work). Now im in trouble with everyone. I feel like its mine i paid for it and i got things i need out of it today while im at work. ,2,1730640010.0,AITAH,2,0.75,False
1gimmcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1gimmcf/weirdest_order_ive_gotten_so_far/,Weirdest order I've gotten so far,"I work at a cafe with a waiter. Yesterday, an old lady came and asked for a ""cortado with cold milk"". I asked my coworker if she meant ""cold"" as in ""not scalding hot"" (people where I live are used to and expect burnt milk, and when you bring them a milk drink with properly steamed milk they complain that it's cold).

My coworker says that no, she asked for clarification and the lady said she wanted cold milk. So we both assume she wanted an iced drink. This was unusual because older customers very rarely order iced drinks.

I make one for her and she complains shortly after. Says that last time she ordered that she got one in a regular coffee cup instead of the glass we serve iced drinks in. And she asked if we could heat it up a bit.

Turns out she wanted lukewarm milk. Like, at around room temperature.

Has anyone encountered this?",5,1730639834.0,barista,3,1.0,False

1gimltx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1gimltx/ed_recovery_and_gastritis/,ED recovery and Gastritis,"I have been struggling with reflux since the middle of July, it was probably due to smoking + abuse of coffee/diet sodas/laxatives + my terrible eating habits (i have been having a restrictive ED with occasional binging episodes for over four years), probably IBS (i cannot, as gross as it sounds, poop ""normally"". I have to resort to digital disimpaction on a daily basis). But ultimately it was triggered by eating airport sushi. Been having a very annoying sensation of lump around my throat ever since. Tested negative for H.Pyori. I had an endoscopy in august and it said i have a weak LES, bile reflux, and mild chronic gastritis (they are probably all ultimately related to my weak LES). Recently I also had a couple heartburn episodes.
Initially I was on a cure of L-Zync Carnosine and stomach coating gel, it seem to work for a bit or at least made it bearable. However I had to move to Korea to complete my Bachelors. I kinda had a relapse in my ED and smoked too. Weird thing is, since I barely eat, my globus sensation almost disappeared. But then it started again.
I've been to doctors here, they prescribed me K-Cab and a bunch of other antiacids, most recently also Rabepranzole but i'm thinking of changing it again cause it gave me anxiety. I don't smoke anymore and I eat three meals a day regularly. Mostly rice and bananas. Even a carrot gave me heartburn today so I really don't understand what I'm doing wrong. There has been periods where my symptoms were gone, I could enjoy more variety of foods, even smoke. And then it comes and goes. Sadly, I think it was when I was not eating a lot. But it is not an option anymore since I am in recovery. Fasting is not an option.
I'm kinda lost and I wish someone could give me advice, mainly diet advice. Unfortunately being in ED recovery while fighting with gastritis is not easy (and maybe the two are actually related). A restrictive diet is not ideal when in recovery, however I do need to watch out what I eat. I'd appreciate if someone could give me advice, a meal plan, whatever. I need some variation into my diet. Oh and I only have microwaves in my dorm so I cannot really cook.(Please recommend easily digestible stuff as everything feels heavy on my stomach rn).
Also, if you have additional tests to recommend that could help me find the proper cure that'd be great. Anti-acids seemed to help but not really on the long run. Maybe because mine is bile reflux. So far, Gaviscon, Carnosyne and Italian meds seemed to be stronger but idk.
Finally, some moral support is needed...please tell me I don't have to give up pizza for the rest of my life. Please tell me I can go back to enjoying food (in moderation ofc). Please tell me there's hope and one day I won't feel this frigging lump. Being far from home is not easy and I feel at loss.",1,1730639785.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False
1giml9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1giml9m/letters_to_home/,Letters to Home,"This is going to just be a brain dump series. My goal is to externally process parts of a personally devastating break up. 

It's messy and complicated. I'm also neurodivergent with CPTSD, so I anticipate the contents to be long-winded and likely a bit overly analytical, as I work through these eee...mooo...tions... blegh. 

So, there's this human. They were my whole world. Before them, my world was balck, white and grey while being put in motion by varying degrees of anxiety, stress and multiple external forces I couldn't control. (I am currently listening to Exitential Kink by Carolyn Elliot PhD, and boy oh boy do I resonate with the thoughts and concepts in this piece.)

My earliest memories shared with this human were in high-school. At the time, I lacked personality. (My home and social life were pretty turbulent, as far back into my life as I can recall.) I remember seeing them, and thinking ""They look like a super gay Kim Possible"" with their cargo khakis, Abercrombie polo with a rainbow studded belt and a rainbow stripped scarf. They even still had the outfit when we started dating a lifetime later.

My most distinct memory of them, was the one in which I confirmed within myself (in totally PG high-school shenanigans style) that I was not entierly straight.

Post high-school (6 years) I ran into them on the sidewalk downtown, in front of what would become a common dinner spot for us. I remember approaching them, and their body language seemed a bit reserved, so I kept a respectful distance (despite my entire nervous system sending a new feeling throughout my entire body, and fighting the urge to go *screechy excited girl* on them, as I has been known to do.) I learned they had just moved back home, after getting out of an abusive relationship. I also learned they were doing spray paint art as a hobby, and still spun fire. (I know... someone tells you they spin fire for fun, and all of a sudden you're fighting your panties to stay the fuck on and chill the fuck out.)

I didn't want to come off too eager, so I played it as cool as I possibly could manage... and lemme tell you, I am the antithesis of cool. So there was much effort used. 

I asked you out to coffee, since I was heading that way. You said you don't really like coffee (*internal face palm* because of course the first time I ask you to hang out, I'd pick a thing you don't like) but you said I could join you in picking up your lunch. Looks like you got rizzed with this tizz I didn't even know I had at the time. 

I don't remember what we talked about, I just remember being smitten at the depth of your person. I remember telling myself ""we are going to do this the right way, this time.""

So I began slowly building a friendship with you. That friendship bloomed into a beautiful little family, and more personal development in the 7 years we spent together (including the shitty ones) I had ever experienced in the 24 years I had existed, up to that point. I learned how to love and prioritize myself in a relationship. I learned how to develop and stand on core beliefs and values. I learned how to comfortably cohabitate with another person, and learned a bunch of nuanced ways to offer support and space for someone I care for, without tapping into my personal energy reserves meant for keeping my life in motion. I even learned how to cook fresh venison, those years you got us a deer,  and that will forever be a point of pride for me. 


This is getting a bit lengthy, and I need to get ready for work. I'll come I'm with another Letter to Home, when the thoughts find me next. 

Sincerely, and forever yours,

So I have a question and I understand it might vary from store to store but yesterday I went into my local Target (this was around 9:30am), and this store has about 50%+ of its merchandise locked up, to get a Crockpot that was in sale (about $35). The crockpot was locked up so I needed some assistance if getting it, now in this same aisle there were Ninja and Keurig coffee makers not locked up but had the alarm wrapped around them (this will come up later). 

After about a 10 minutes wait, using the call button a few times (do they even work?), multiple team members walking by but not stopping finally got someone from electronics attention to grab it for me. So he unlocks it and then asks if I was done shopping, and I was like um I don't know why. And then he says that since he unlocked the cabinet and grabbed the product he's the one that has to ring me up. And so I told him what happens if I'm not done shopping/looking around, he then tells me he can hold it for me but I need to come back to Electronics to purchase for me. 

So I'm like okay I'm done shopping, and then I ask well what about the coffee makers (which are more expensive) that aren't locked up but with alarms on them- what's the difference I can grab one and continue my shopping and check out up front, but since you unlocked a cabinet and pulled out a crockpot I have to check out now or I have to bring up my entire purchase to electronics to check out? He didn't answer. I've had to grab other things from locked cabinets (varies per store) but wasn't forced to buy it from the person handing it to me so it just felt odd. 

Tl;Dr: asked for a crockpot out of locked cabinet, more expensive coffee makers not locked up. Team Member said that since he unlocked the cabinet he has to ring it up. 


So just wondering on for small kitchen appliances, if someone unlocks the cabinet do they have to check me out, or is that he was just bored and wanted the sale? 

Thank you for all your help!

I am just about to hit 10k miles on the bike and I bought it brand new last year. I beat the ever living shit out of it, so I guess this is what I get. Still I am pretty disappointed if this actually ends up being a bad wheel bearing. I feel like it should have lasted longer than this, oh well. For more context, I drive on dirt every day, and in all weather conditions. last year I probably did close to 1000 miles in the rain. I would say about 500 of those miles were heavy thunderstorms where I would hydroplane on the highway, so lots of water on the road. I never really ""try"" to wheelie it, but it ""happens"" on occasion.

Lately, I‚Äôve been struggling with productivity.

It‚Äôs not even about the coffee‚ÄîI just go there to sit with people, maybe chat a bit, and end up watching TikTok for a couple of hours. But the thing is, I don‚Äôt actually enjoy it when I‚Äôm there, and I feel like I‚Äôd rather be back home getting things done.

Usually, after spending the morning at the cafe, I come home, have lunch, and then end up feeling too lazy to work, especially with that food coma kicking in. This habit is really holding me back, and I‚Äôd like to break out of it.

I thought I‚Äôd ask here on the Morocco subreddit because I know a lot of people here understand the culture of going to cafes daily. Any advice on how to change this routine and get back on track would be super helpful!

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1gimawr,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gimawr/is_my_girlfriend_33f_cheating_or_is_she_just/,Is my girlfriend [33F] cheating or is she just accusing me [39M] because of her insecurities?,"My girlfriend keeps attacking me and accusing me for a friendship I had with a girl (35F) I call M that I met half a year before we met. 

A bit of a background: M and I met last August and For a short while, we dated, but it didn‚Äôt work out as a couple. We had interesting conversations however and decided that we work better as friends. We met once or twice a month for a coffee, and very occasionally (think once or twice a week) texted a couple of sentences to each other. It was purely platonic and we never did anything sexual since last August together.

I met my girlfriend around November last year, and I asked her if she was ok with me being friends with M given the background. She said it was fine and so we continued to talk. Had she said now, I would‚Äôve understood and ended the friendship with M. For whatever reason, conversations between M and I started to fizzle out slowly, and eventually, it got to a point that we stopped talking.

During this time, my girlfriend kept asking me about her and I said I haven‚Äôt heard back from her in many weeks and I think the friendship fizzled out.

This was enough for her to get suspicious. She told me that ‚Äúthere must have been a reason that you stopped talking‚Äù and no matter how I tried to explain it, she wouldn‚Äôt believe me. She asked me to setup a meeting with M so that she can meet her. I tried to explain that I haven‚Äôt heard from this girl for months and it would be weird but I still sent a text to M to setup this meeting but  M wanted none of it and didn‚Äôt reply back to me.

My girlfriend continued pressing on the issue so much that I offered that I would even block M and delete her number in front of her. Even this wasn‚Äôt enough and it started to escalate with her shouting and screaming at me that I must have cheated with this girl on her, otherwise why wouldn‚Äôt she wanted to meet her? This has happened multiple times  since then and it‚Äôs escalating. As far as things go, last text I have from M before I deleted her number was in August, and last time I saw her was in May.

Bear in mind, I spend the whole weekends with the girlfriend, and she knows that every day, from 5am to 9pm I am busy working and studying something so I wouldn‚Äôt even have the time to cheat, if I wanted to.

I know from internet research that it‚Äôs typically the cheaters who accuse their partner of cheating which is why I‚Äôm asking this question: is it likely that she‚Äôs the one who is cheating and therefore, she‚Äôs projecting it on me, or can it be explained by insecurities? 

For reference, she has far more free time than me. She works part time, lives in her own apartment, and has many male friends. I only have two female friends (now one) and the rest of my friends are all male who she has already met. The other female friend is in a different country and so it‚Äôs not easy for them to meet.

I am out of my wits ends since I can‚Äôt prove a negative. I can‚Äôt prove I haven‚Äôt cheated but I also can‚Äôt go on like this either and be accused every other day. Ideally I‚Äôd try to keep the relationship alive since she has a lot of positives as well, but if this continues, I can‚Äôt see how I could. If anyone has any opinions, I‚Äôd be very happy to hear it.",1,1730638832.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Three hours to get here and three hours to get the power working. I wonder, often, what sort of an operation you think you‚Äôre running? The subject of my report - my charge, if you will - is the bridge connecting \[redacted\] to \[redacted\]. Bridge=Georgian, red brick, wide enough for one car, lit by sort of intricate looking street lamps. Foot traffic minimal so far. But who would ever want to go to \[redacted\]? I will attempt crossing tonight as instructed.

\++11.11.2012++

Crossing only marginal success. Crossed bridge in 2 minutes the first time. Was so overjoyed with my success, tried to make the return trip over the bridge - rather than the suggested re-route past the coffee shop and the fresco of \[redacted\]. Second trip took twenty-five minutes. I suspect my stopwatch malfunctioned at the midpoint, so perhaps thirty-five minutes.

\++12.11.2012++

Didn‚Äôt realise I was meant to record my trips with such detail. Yes - it was mostly fog. In the distance were those trees, thick trunked, looming far past the sky. No sounds beyond usual city ambience; again, unusual. Same sign repeated every hundred or so steps - the school crossing one we‚Äôve seen in other instances.

Fine, yes, I do see how these observations are useful.

But no sign of Them. Never is initially. Don‚Äôt know why you get your hopes up.

\++13.11.2012++

Foot traffic minimal again today. Most avoid the bridge. Common sentiment is that if you want to get to \[redacted\] you‚Äôre better off going down by the canal.

Six boys on bikes entered from the west side of the bridge. I looked down at my crossword (I know, I know, negligent) and when I looked up they were gone.¬†

Entered on the east side on bike provided. No sign of them. Came out on the west side. Swore. Turned the bike around. Entered from the west side this time and had a similar experience to several weeks ago. Fog everywhere, those massive trees. Some sound this time. But no end in sight. Pedalled for twenty minutes before I came on the boys. They had abandoned/dismounted their bikes and were standing looking out over the bridge‚Äôs railing. They were terrified at what they saw.

I got their attention after a while. I had the badge out as per regulation. Already they had the signs. Hard to describe really. The sharpness in the eyes. The slight gauntness to the face. One of them had lost a fingernail.

Managed to get them on their bikes with some persuading. They were desperate to keep looking. Showed them the badge again. That worked wonders. And then I think the fear kicked in, as we all went hell for leather to get out of there.¬†

Still pedalled for far longer than expected. Still saw that damned sign. But we got out, safe-ish. Have provided a list of boys details, addresses, names, star signs, etc, with dispatch.

It‚Äôs always an old lady. She entered West side.

Encountered her like the others just staring out. Same procedure: badge: stop looking at that: and hooked her arm in mine. We exited but not as successful as the boys. She threw up a whole litre of that foul blue stuff then collapsed. Called evac. She was dead by the time they arrived. Eyes so black you can sort of see yourself in them. She lived in \[redacted}; the family and news outlets (why were they involved!?)¬† have been informed the incident was a stroke.

Woah, thanks for the shiny new terminal guys! It‚Äôs **way** better than my old terminal. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, - just been doing this all day. That said, nothing to report. Is dispiriting boredom considered relevant? I think not.

\++24.11.2012++

Yes, I agree the terms.¬†

Nothing to report. Did you know that in 1793 \[redacted\] opened a bar beneath this very bridge?

\++25.11.2012++

As extrapolated from the various reports you sent over prior to me heading out, yes, it does appear that the longer you spend in parallel, the longer it takes to get out. This is terrifying when you consider certain agents have been tasked with spending a month on stairways, in corridors and alleys. They must have been there for years.

I entered four days ago for what was meant to be an overnight stay. Set up a tent neatly beneath one of the signs.¬†

Woke to find the sign had gone. Love that.¬†

Began walking, realised after about an hour I hadn‚Äôt seen a sign. Noted that down. Walked for another hour: came upon my tent beneath a sign (I‚Äôd packed up my tent and had it on my back). So I noted that down as well.

Already, I believed the amount you paid me was not enough.

Already, I began to regret taking the job in the first place.¬†

Kept walking though. Walked for hours.

Some description for R&D: fog continued to be oppressive; bluish light near the place where we would consider the sky to be; those trees seem to move a little.¬†

They - the big They - don‚Äôt understand noise after you‚Äôve been in parallel for a time. There was city ambience, but it was like a mockery of city ambience, the wrong birds, sirens and horns rather than passing cars. I heard waves, like on-a-beach-waves. I don‚Äôt know whether it was because they were tethering on to me and my experience, and as I‚Äôd slept, and my subconscious had drawn other experiences to the surface, the continuity of the parallel had been fractured. Working theory. You can determine whether I‚Äôm talking shit.

I saw Them, of course. Based on rations I would say I‚Äôd been in there for around three days. Obviously I am an alerted denizen, so their approach was faltering and skittish.

I did look. I think the light caught my eye peripherally and just by instinct I turned my head. And I saw, of course I saw. All of it. The Unravelling. The Promised Gifts. The Falling of the Light. The Symphony for the Slumberers. I looked away, but only just. They hounded me all the way back, sparking and flashing and trying to make me look once again.

When I arrived back in my little bunker, I used the mirror to look beneath my eyelids. There‚Äôs a line of sheer black around the iris. Concerning. May need medicine.

Nothing more to report. I have not slept for three days, so next report will not be prompt. Sorry.

\++26.11.2012++

Low and behold, nothing to report. Slept like a baby. Not that you care about that.

\++27.11.2012++

Woah, what‚Äôs that? Is it‚Ä¶.nothing to report? Why golly, yes it is!

\++28.11.2012++

Blackness around the iris is ever so slightly expanding. Like a spot where you‚Äôre not sure it‚Äôs getting bigger and then actually yes it does look like it‚Äôs getting bigger and then, oh my, yes, actually that is a big spot. No itchiness yet. I don‚Äôt know whether you have the medicine to treat this, but if you do, please send it.

As a Khalistan separatist raised in Canada, I never fully connected with my cultural roots until I saw Justin Trudeau play dress up for Diwali.

My parents encouraged assimilation but as I grew older, I yearned to learn more about my Khalistani culture than drink Tim Hortons coffee all day and enjoy my life in Canada.

Initially I found Khalistani names ugly and too much, especially compared to Western names I grew up with, like Juniper, Bwrandon, Romy, Violet, Jace and Kaiser. However as I discovered the richness and beauty of Khalistani names, particularly the longer ones that were once mocked.

When I married my wife, who has blonde hair but dark roots, she embraced me with enthusiasm. It was a sensational feeling especially given that she wears very big bras. Together we both decided to give our kids Khalistani names.

1gim6vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gim6vv/cant_get_over_someone/,Cant get over someone,"So, I have a problem.  I hope to god no one I know sees this which is why its on an alt account.

I talked to this girl for 2 months. We didnt date so I cant call her my ex (I‚Äôll get into this later in the post).  For the first half of this, things were great.

We hit it off really well on our first date.  She had broken a 6 month streak of celibacy for me, on the first night.  Needless to say I felt pretty damn good about myself after that.  And frankly, my only intentions at first were to get laid.  

But then we started hanging out very frequently.  Dates, ‚Äúnetflix and chill,‚Äù texting all the time, the works.  Again, still not really taking it too seriously.

But then I‚Äôm like ‚Äúoh shit, I get excited when she texts me, oh shit I‚Äôm interested in how her day went, oh shit I get warm and fuzzy thinking of her‚Ä¶‚Äù. Yea.  We all know what that means.

On the night of our third date, we were in bed, I told her I liked her and she said she felt the same way.  Awesome.

We continue from there at the same pace, but we get to a point where neither of us really know what‚Äôs going on.  This led me to become a bit more reserved and quiet around her, leading to some more confusion on both our ends.  But I‚Äôd say things were still going well at this point.

One day, it was my first day of a new job, my 15 year old dog wasnt doing too well, and I was really stressed.  I texted her and it didnt deliver.  I dont wanna reveal too much info but she has a job where she sometimes doesnt have service on her phone.  Due to my outside stress, and the fact that I‚Äôve been done dirty by women in the recent past before this (read: blocked/ghosted out of nowhere) I kinda freaked out and thought she blocked me.  Understandably, she didnt like this.  

I called her that night and apologized, which she greatly appreciated and told me as much.  Problem solved.  The next day was the first day at my new (current) job.  We talked on the phone again about where we were at.  Basically a ‚Äúwhat are we‚Äù kind of thing, and it went really well.  We established again that we both liked eachother and wanted to continue to see where this would go.  And then talked for like another hour after that just about random stuff.  Went to bed really happy that night.

A few more days pass.  Things are great.  My first week at my then-new job goes fantastically.  Texting this girl all the time, we‚Äôre both really into it.  Friday comes.  I plan on getting high and gaming after work that day.  She‚Äôs out at a bar with one of her friends, and is giving me the whole ‚Äúpleaseeee come out, I wanna seeeee youuu‚Äù kind of thing over text.  I couldnt resist that, so I went.

I get there, she looks amazing.  We have an amazing night.  She is all over me, flirting, kissing, great conversation, drinking just a lot of fun.  It gets to be pretty late that night.  I ask her to be my girlfriend.  She says yes.  She‚Äôs a bit taken aback, which is understandable, and she asks me to ask her again ‚Äúbut this time REALLY ask‚Äù as in look her in the eye and whatnot.  And I did.  And she says yes again.  And I‚Äôm over the moon.

We continue having fun.  We‚Äôre about to leave and I go to the bathroom.  This guy in the bathroom solicits me asking me to purchase a small bag of a certain substance.  Since me and this woman both enjoy said substance from time to time, I say yes and surprise her, and do some myself in the bathroom.

I come back out to see her talking to another guy.  Completely innocently about nothing.  She‚Äôs a pretty girl so guys are gonna come up to her at bars and whatnot.  This was not and is not new info to me, trust me and please dont lecture me on this in the comments.  Even knowing this, in my heightened emotional state, drug and alcohol induced stupor, I got upset with her for talking to another guy.   I didnt yell or anything but I was like ‚Äúwow you‚Äôre doing this already?‚Äù  So, so, SO fucking stupid.  It was one of those things where halfway through the sentence I already knew I fucked up.

She is obviously upset at me doing this.  Very upset.  And understandably so.  I acted like I didnt trust her, even though I did, twice in the same week.  Why?  Im still trying to figure out myself. 

We went back to her house and talked about it.  I begged for forgiveness.  She said she has let things like this slide in the past and came to regret it.  She calls off the relationship when I asked her if we‚Äôre together.

We go to sleep.  I spend the whole next day with her.  Its a really nice relaxing time.  We watched tv, laughed, had some deep talks, even had sex again.  I left later that day still feeling nervous about what would end up happening as a result of this, but somewhat optimistic that she‚Äôd forgive me and focus on what she liked about me.

I gave her space for about 2 days to think.  She texts me and says that it‚Äôs not gonna work.  I‚Äôm devastated.  I call her and we talk.  She says we got caught up and she was also worried about other things like me getting attached too quickly and that she wasnt 100% sure if she was ready for something serious (then why say yes twice?  Idk). So the call ends and I figure thats it.

This was Monday.  Flash forward to friday, my dog dies at age 15.  Im devastated again.  One of the worst weeks of my life.  Saturday night around 1am I‚Äôm falling asleep on my couch to YouTube.  I had posted an instagram pic of my dog as a memorial.  The girl saw it, and texted me.  We text back and forth about everything that had happened.  We both hated how it went, and agreed that there had to be some kind of connection for things to go the way they did.  We agreed to keep in touch.

For that week, we talked basically like how we were.  Constant texting, flirting often, etc.  She was moving to my town at the end of that week.  I had told her in the past that I‚Äôd help her move.

Saturday comes again.  I see her for the first time.  She gave me a big hug and we said we missed eachother.  She took me into her room and we made out a bit.  

Her friends are there.  Some I‚Äôve met, some I hadn‚Äôt.  We go through the long and arduous process of moving.  We all busted our asses.  We drink heavily that night to celebrate.  I got super drunk but apparently I didnt do anything bad or stupid according to them.  Her and I cuddle on a couch to sleep after some more making out.

We spend the next day day drinking with her friends, had a lot of fun, and went to bed with her after watching a movie by ourselves.  I went to cuddle with her again and she kinda pushed me away but we still slept in the same bed.

We ate bagels the next morning and kissed goodbye, I had to leave either way.  We didnt text for a few days, she was legit busy with her job and still doing stuff for her new place.  But I kinda felt something was off.  I texted her mid-week asking how everything was going.  She responds and from there, we talk a bit here and there everyday.  Not like it was, but still having nice convos daily.

We go out for coffee that weekend, she carved out time in her day for me after she got off work when she couldve easily given some BS excuse like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm busy, I‚Äôm tired‚Äù etc.  but she didnt and we had a nice time.

From there we continued at the same cadance of texting for a little bit everyday, until later the next week she kinda just stops answering for a few days.  Eventually I text her and we talk for a bit and she tells me that she lost feelings and doesnt see this going anywhere.  Saying things like ‚Äúi dont think our personalities fit and we‚Äôre on different pages with everything‚Äù. This makes no sense to me because how did things get so intense if it was a simple matter of us not clicking/fitting?  She was super into me before my mistakes, the night after the bar she had told me that she was waiting for me to ask her to make things official, and now we just ‚Äúdont fit‚Äù ???  I just dont understand.  If she said ‚Äúhey i cant get over you not trusting me at the bar and when you thought I blocked you‚Äù it would still hurt but I‚Äôd get it.  And she even agreed at one point before that there had to be a strong connection for us to feel this way about both the positive and negatice aspects of the situation.

And thats it.  Its been about 6 weeks since this happened and I‚Äôve been a wreck since, plus my dog dying obviously doesnt help matters.

I dont know how to get over this or what to learn from this, as I knew a lot of my actions were wrong in the first place, but I still did them.  I cherish the good times with her, but it wasnt worth the pain im feeling now.  Other women I‚Äôve been involved with for much longer were easier to get over.  Deaths of friends and family have been easier to get over.  Ive tried everything, talking to death about it to my therapist, friends and family, immersing myself into my job as much as possible, going even harder at the gym than usual, all my hobbies, going out with friendsand yes, even hooking up with other women has not really helped.  

I dont catch feelings very often at all, but when I do it never seems to work.  I‚Äôm attractive, funny, and intelligent, I have no problem ‚Äúgetting laid‚Äù but whenever I want something more with someone it just always goes wrong somehow.  And I never just conceptually want a girlfriend.  When I want a relationship, theres always someone specific in mind.  It never fucking works.

I had this in the palm of my hand and it slipped away.  She was perfect throughout the whole thing.  Of course everyone has flaws, but she had yet to show hers, so I cant even be like ‚Äúfuck her she did me wrong‚Äù because I truly dont believe thats the case.  In fact I understand where she‚Äôs coming from.  Some of my friends who ive talked to about this disagree, but not all.  And what few qualms I had about her were insignificant and easy to get over.  Anythinf I was insecure about or hesitant to bring up to her, she had the most perfect response to.  Its not a validation thing either.  I really thought/think she was special.  

I feel embarrassed and ridiculous for feeling this depressed over someone I knew for such a short time.  And I feel like more progress should have been made by now.  It also feels like there were things she was keeping from me when she was breaking things off, as she kept saying theres nothing specific but she‚Äôs just going with her gut.

So I guess I‚Äôve said enough.  If I knew it would end like this I wouldve never tried to take it further than just a hookup.  Even though she‚Äôs great I kinda wish none of it even happened. I cant shake the feeling like this was wrong and it wasnt supposed to end up this way. 

TLDR: I met a girl, we hit it off, asked her to be my gf, she says yes, I did some dumb shit that made her re evaluate the situation and call the relationship off, she gives me another chance but she cant bring herself to have feelings for me again, its been 6 weeks and I cant get over her for the fucking life of me and I‚Äôm depressed as fuck.",1,1730638458.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I'm getting back into coffee more seriously and want to try some new coffees. I'm big on the Chemex with an occasional dip into Kalita Wave territory, and generally prefer medium to dark roast coffees. I have a love for classic diner coffee, and classic flavor profiles, but am not afraid to get a little adventurous. I don't think I have a refined enough technique for a light roast single origin, but am willing to learn a little bit.

I'm based in the US but am potentially willing to pay international shipping for exceptional coffee.

So I have a few questions for you all, answer any and all you feel you want to!

1. Recommend me some coffees please! I'm excited to try new roasters and new roasts. Tell me about your favorite local roaster and what coffees you love from them!
2. Any resources you might have on developing better technique, books or YouTube videos, or whatever?

Thanks in advance all, and happy pouring!

F27 Went on a first date with this man M32 

He picked me up and pretty early into our time he said a comment like ‚Äúyou said you didn‚Äôt measure your height?‚Äù I said no but I‚Äôm probably around 170cm. He said yeah around 170cm. 

We had good conversation then got out of the car and he said yeah you‚Äôre tall and I awkwardly just said yeah I am. He goes but I‚Äôm still taller than you. 

At this point I obviously picked up that this may have been an issue for him and he may of sensed it on my face. 

We proceeded to get coffee and have a good conversation, as we were walking back to the car I was explaining something to him and he says something like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre shy, you won‚Äôt even look me in the eye hahaha‚Äù I said yeah I am. He said something like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs cute.‚Äù We had great conversation and lots of joking around so it was very light and playful. 

As we were walking back to the car he went on to say ‚Äúno no you‚Äôre a good height, I like it it‚Äôs different.‚Äù At this point I‚Äôm feeling a bit awkward because he keeps bringing it up but this comment reassured me that perhaps I was rubbing off on him. 

When we got to the car he said something like ‚Äúhow did you find us meeting up?‚Äù and I went on to explain that I thought he was really nice and we had a great meet up. He said yeah you were shy you didn‚Äôt look me in the eyes but this is a good sign but I won‚Äôt explain why. At this point he probably sensed that yes I was shy because yes I did like him. But he seemed happy about it. 

As he dropped me home I said ‚Äúthank you for tonight and thank you for coming out. I had a great time, take care.‚Äù He said ‚Äútake care? Usually someone says that when they‚Äôre about to block someone! Haha‚Äù I said ‚Äúno no I had a great time. Thank you.‚Äù And went home. 

He texted me once he got home ‚Äúit was nice seeing you‚Äù I said ‚Äúlikewise. Thank you for coming out x‚Äù and that was it. I probably expected a little bit more from him tbh. 

Just confused because at first I thought maybe he wasn‚Äôt attracted to me because of my height, but all in all we had great conversation and the last few bits of comments made me think he wanted me to like him because he was worried I wasn‚Äôt going to see him again by the ‚Äútake care‚Äù comment. 

We also didn‚Äôt kiss or anything, no hug or physical contact which I wasn‚Äôt used to and felt like maybe he didn‚Äôt like me because he didn‚Äôt make a move.

So far I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm ecstatic with the results. I was expecting a fairly full-flavored but light body/crisp coffee but the results have been more bitter and more oily than I was expecting. Granted, I‚Äôve been using a dark roast but is this what pour over typically produces? 

Background: I‚Äôve been making my coffee with an aeropress the last 3 years where I can consistently get a very light-bodied (almost tea-like?), not oily, full flavored brew every time. For AP, I usually do about 12g of coffee to 8oz of water. 

Was expecting something similar with the Aiden, just in larger quantities. For what it‚Äôs worth, I know I‚Äôm still dialing in the right grinder settings, but still, was hoping for less oily, less bitter results. Been using the guided brew for dark roast. Is it just all down to the  bean I‚Äôm using currently? I know I won‚Äôt be getting it again, that‚Äôs for certain. Still, hoping to get different results outta this puppy and need some guidance on what I‚Äôm potentially(?) doing wrong.

I was diagnosed with proctitis back in 2011 with my symptoms being mild- just blood and mucus in the stool. I had some very mild flares that were brought under control with a mesalamine suppository within just a few days of taking it. Since 2019 I‚Äôve been on a maintenance dose of oral mesalamine and mini flares were managed with mesalamine suppositories. I just had my second child 7 months ago. While I was pregnant, the manufacturer of my oral mesalamine changed and I started developing cramping when I was having a bowel movement. I went back on the other manufacturer but haven‚Äôt been able to get back to where I was prior to the manufacturer change since. Around 5 months postpartum, I went into my biggest flare ever. I also started drinking coffee at this time which I had stopped drinking in March 2020 (possibly the cause??). I have blood in the stool, lose stools, cramping while going to the bathroom, needing to go 4 times in a row to empty out completely. This is all complicated by the fact that I developed hemorrhoids and a rectocele (stool gets trapped in a pocket in my rectum) following the birth of my first child. I‚Äôm 7 months postpartum now so this flare has been going on for a couple months now. The past few weeks my lower back and hips and legs and knees have started to ache almost like I have the flu. From the posts I‚Äôve read on here it seems like bad flares can cause this type of reaction. I‚Äôve also been super nauseous lately (not pregnant but could be attributed to hormone changes since I‚Äôm 7 months postpartum). I have developed a fear of colon cancer because this flare has so many new symptoms that I‚Äôve never had before. I have a colonoscopy scheduled for January but I‚Äôm on the cancellation list and trying to get it moved up. I have no abdominal pain when I don‚Äôt have to go to the bathroom. Does this all sound like a typical flare or should I be concerned about something worse? I‚Äôm so nervous with having two small children.

1giltmy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1giltmy,29 [M4F] ,"Howdy!

29 year old here on the East Coast looking for someone to connect with! Open to in-person or online. I enjoy traveling so if we really hit it off I'd be open to planning a fun trip together! Also open to anything from platonic to something serious. Just putting myself out there and seeing what happens!

A little about me:

I absolutely love music - whether it's playing guitar, spinning vinyl (I love collecting and listening to records), or going to concerts. It'd be great to find a more concert friends! Let me know what upcoming concerts you're going to! I also love spending time outside with my dog. He's got a cute outdoorsy name but you'll have to message me to find out what it is haha. We go on all sorts of adventures running, hiking, camping, paddle boarding, and hammocking. Recently I've been getting more into coffee and I think it'd be super fun to have someone to share a virtual coffee/tea with almost daily if time allows and the interest is there. I don't have to work until 9:00 AM most days and I get up early and usually just listen to one side of a record before heading to work. But it'd be fun to spend that time having a nice morning chat with someone while we sip on our drinks. I know that physical attraction is important so I‚Äôd prefer to exchange photos early-on to determine if there's mutual physical attraction (I‚Äôve also included photos of myself).

If any of this post piqued your interest then feel free to shoot me a chat/message! Cheers!",2,1730637230.0,Singles,3,1.0,False

The next morning Luke tried starting his truck again this time it started with no problems so he continued his trip. that night Luke was jamming to his radio when his truck stalled once again.

On days when it's better is when I haven't eaten anything that triggers acidity. 

Remember Even people with horrible oral hygiene don't have this disgusting smell. It's definitely from the stomach guys

I'll be landing on 16 November to LAX, but picking up a hire a car and leaving straight away and heading to San Francisco. I'd originally planned on taking CA-1 but unfortunately it seems like parts of it are closed, so thinking of just taking I-5 now to save time. Was also going to drive up the Oregon coast to Portland, but seems like there is a good chance that it would be raining and thus negate the beautiful views. Also, how safe is it sleeping in your car in a rest area.

Where would be a good area to stay in San Francisco, or should I stay across the bay in Oakland. As I'll have a car, will need somewhere with secure parking, to avoid my car being broken into.

 I like hipster neighbourhoods with cool bars, restaurants and coffee spots, enjoy stret art and cool architecture.

If anyone has any craft beer recommendations, please shout out. Would love to find somewhere that does good barrel aged stouts or barely wines. Is Toronado worth visiting. I know that it is cash only and I usually avoid these places. Also, does anyone know why it is still cash only, when a lot of places are the opposite nowadays.

I like my natural wines, so any good food places that serve natural wines would be great.

Also just general food places in general, especially Mexican and Asian food and your typical American food places, be it burgers, hot dogs or breakfast.

I did visit in 2018 and really enjoyed it, but always good getting local advice. Also, is it as bad as the media makes out with the homeless situation and stores closing because of continually getting robbed. When I was there I did see someone shooting up in the middle of the day, which was a little shocking, but never felt in any danger.

I just got back from six weeks in SE Asia. Had an absolute blast, I‚Äôm already planning my next trip.

My trip involved a few flights between countries 
and my goodness, the parents at the airports just looked like they were hating life. It was either parents trying to manage twenty suitcases and keep track of all their kids at the same time, or kids screaming while the parents stared blankly like they were dead inside, or the mum doing all the work wrangling the kids at the terminal while the dad just played on his phone. They had no time to relax or just go get a coffee while waiting for the plane because of their kids.
I‚Äôm so grateful I‚Äôm childfree, I‚Äôll never have to travel like that.

Side note: I‚Äôve mentioned to a few parents (when asked) that one of the major reasons I‚Äôm childfree is that I love to travel, often spontaneously. Their comeback is often that they can still travel with their kids. Whenever I ask when was the last time and location that they travelled, they‚Äôll say something like ‚Äòwe went to the next town over last year.‚Äô The look on their faces when I tell them I go overseas at least once a year is priceless!",27,1730636612.0,childfree,4,0.97,False

Thanks, Captain Scarlet, now for the rest of the story.



Every quiet evening in the heart of Sydney, Captain Scarlet would relax in a comfy chair with no TV on, still wearing his uniform, smoking a cigarette and drinking coffee whilst reading the newspaper. When the sunset was as beautiful as it was, He would walk out onto the balcony and gaze out at the neighbourhood's activity getting slower and quieter. On this afternoon, he gazed out into the distance, his short hair blowing in the chill wind.



It was then that he started to cry. He was crying, but what for? It was in what he said next that he realised. ""Why? Why am I indestructible? Could it be that they injected me with a special formula to make me indestructible? Am I...a robot?"" Captain Scarlet was crying so much that he immediately thought indestructibility was a bit too much for him, so he decided to go to bed.
