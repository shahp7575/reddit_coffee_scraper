I'd been working more than usual due to a deadline recently, so now that its finished I wanted to do something fun with my kids. I have not sent my 4yo to daycare and I've taken the them (20mo and 4yo) to a ""salt-therapy place for kids"" its supposedly good for respiratory and dermatological problems (even if thats bogus, it was a genuinely fun thing to do on a bad-weather day). The place has the ""beach"" where kids can play in salt like a huge sandbox, lots of fun. And then a large café area where you can buy food and drinks and its adjacent to a play area (parents can drink coffee watching kids play, real nice).

Well, when we were done with the ""beach"" time and they went to play and i got us some food and drinks. There is one of those ball-pits and my toddler has never been to one, so this was her first time and she was excited! There was only one other mom and her son in the entire area at this time, very unusual. I bought sandwiches for the kids and for a bit we all sat by the table but it was not supposed to be a serious ""sit down to lunch"" moment since it was clear that they would be too excited and my younger got really worked up about the ballpit. I decided to just let them play and wait with the rest of the food for later.  (No I wouldn't let them bring food or dirty hands into the play area).

I had not even noticed that the other mom had gotten her son a soup in the meantime. The second they went back to play the other mother went to rant to me how her 2,5yo will not sit and eat when my kids are playing! How ""cant your kids sit for 5 more minutes?"" I was stunned. She went on to tell me ""he had been eating soup, so that was super important"" to her and that he hates soup and how my kids just ruined it. I just stared at her. 

The whole place was empty. There were many tables further away from the play area.  Even with no view of the play area. She chose to sit next to the play area! She ended up sitting on the bench of the play area and spoonfeeding the soup to her kid in the ballpit. 

AITAH? Should I have kept my kids at the table foe them to finish eating? Was there some unwritten etiquette? ",1,1768630827.0,Mommit,0,1.0,False

“Double chest” refers to a “Fancy” Red & Green  chests.

Lvl 1 generator part = 1 regular chest
Lvl 2 generator part = 1 double chest
Lvl 3 generator part = 2  double chests
Lvl 4 part/generator = 4 double chests
Lvl 5 generator = 8 double chests
Lvl 6 generator = 16 double chests
Lvl 7 generator = 32 double chests
Lvl 8 generator = 64 double chests
Lvl 9 generator = 128 double chests
Lvl 10 generator = 256 double chests
Lvl 11 generator = 512 double chests

—How to Calculate What You Still Need:
Step 1: Find how many double chests the target level requires.
Step 2: Add up the double chest value of what you already own.
Step 3: Subtract your total from the target.

—Example
Goal: Upgrade to Level 9 coffee maker
You currently have:
	•	Level 3 part = 2 double chests
	•	Level 7 coffee mkr = 32 double chests
	•	Level 8 coffee mkr= 64 double chests

Total you already have:
2 + 32 + 64 = 98 double chests

Level 9 requires: 128 double chests

So: 128 − 98 = 30 double red chests needed

1qf5lu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qf5lu0/ive_been_eating_a_small_piece_of_paper_every_day/,"I've been eating a small piece of paper every day for 11 years to ""balance my fiber."" Is it too late to stop?","I'm posting this because my wife and I are going on a trip next month and I've been quietly panicking about it for weeks.

Back in high school I read something online about how paper is technically cellulose which is technically fiber. I was having bad digestive issues at the time and wasn't eating great. So I guess I just decided to try it. Next morning, everything worked fine and so I did it again.

That was many years ago and... I still do it. Not every single day (that would've been insane), I've missed probably a few dozen times over the years when I was sick or forgot or couldn't figure out the logistics, but close to every day. It's just part of my routine now. I wake up, I tear off a little piece of paper, I chew it while the coffee brews. It takes like ten seconds.

I know how this sounds. But my digestion has been fine. And every time I've missed a few days, I start feeling off. Could be psychosomatic. Probably is. But then I eat the paper again and things go back to normal, so what am I supposed to do with that?

I looked up pica once and that didn't seem like me. I don't want to eat paper. I just do it because I've always done it and stopping feels like tempting fate.

The problem is my wife - she doesn't know. When I'm at her place I usually do it in the bathroom, just tear off a bit of toilet paper and chew it quick. At my place I do it in the kitchen before she wakes up. But we're going to Tokyo for ten days and we'll be together literally 24/7 and I keep thinking about how I'm going to do this in a hotel room without her noticing or asking questions.

I've thought about just skipping it for the trip. Ten days isn't that long. But the longest I've ever gone is five days and by day four I was anxious and weird and convinced something bad was about to happen even though nothing did. I don't know if I can do ten days in a foreign country while pretending to be normal.

1qf5kr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qf5kr6/aitah_i_didnt_got_to_my_friends_wedding_and_now_i/,AITAH? I didn’t got to my friends wedding and now I think she may not come to mine.,"Quick back story. I (27f) have been “best friends” with Lucy since junior year of high school. 2017 to be exact. We weren’t necessarily together 24/7 but we hung out when we could. Spent birthdays together, went to hoco, and other random outings. But as usual when we graduated high school hangouts became less and less. she moved to the next city over, we got full time jobs and you know how it goes. But I’ve always tried my best to make time for my friends even if it’s just for an hour.   
   
Anyway after she got engaged I drove out to her to help find and make some things for her wedding. A litte while after that day I planned a little breakfast date for us at our old favorite coffee shop. The date almost didn’t happen because she mentioned how much studying she had to do for tests coming up and said she wasn’t going to be able to chat long.. which is fine I get it. But the way she was talking in texts just sounded like it was a hassle to see me. When we got there the vibes just felt off. I could tell she didn’t want to be there. But I pushed on. Conversation was slightly awkward but maybe that’s because im awkward and we hadn’t talked much before.   


Fast foward and I start seeing her asking people to be her bridesmaids. I was patiently waiting for her to pop the question and it never came. It kind of hurt deep down cause by that point we had known each other for 5 years and I thought we were close enough for me to be included in the bridal party even though we had stopped hanging out at much. None the less I brushed it off.

 Then my 25th birthday came. My wonderful then gf now fiancé threw me a surprise party. She showed up a little late but that’s not a big deal considering I didn’t expect her to show up anyway. Then I got invited to dress shopping . It was fine I knew one friend there so it was just slightly awkward for me but I’m a shy person. They went to a restaurant next door after but I decided not to tag along only because I felt awkward not being a talkative person. So maybe that was wrong of me? Maybe I should have went anyways IDK Cause she seemed slightly upset. it was one of those “you don’t have to if you don’t want to”. Then the bachelorette party came. It was only a handful of us cause she had  one  already back at her college with those friends. I had a great time actually got tipsy and shared some laughs.

 But here’s where things shifted. After that day I was reminded  my fiancé’s niece’s 16th birthday was the weekend of her wedding. We hadn’t seen her niece in nearly two years and at the time her niece was in a bad mental state due to family issues and she begged me not to miss her sweet 16. Since she wasn’t too interested in hanging out with me before I didn’t think it would be a big deal to not go to the wedding. Huge mistake. Every time after that talking over text and snap  felt weird. Fast forward a couple weeks she confesses to me over text how hurt she was I wasn’t there. That it was a big day for her, she was struggling with family relationships and was stressed. She said it would have meant a lot for me to be there. So naturally I’ve felt like shit ever since. I apologized and explained why I didnt show up and how it hurt me that I wasn’t included in the wedding party. But she explained that it was a hard decision for her. Again I TOTALLY get it, I’m a very understanding person. I know you can’t choose everybody. Doesn’t mean I can’t feel hurt.   


We moved on and things are fine now. We don’t talk nearly as much and haven’t hung out since the bachelorette party. But here come the empty  “I miss you too!”s. About a week ago I asked her if she could do my makeup for my wedding that’s not until next year. Her response was “oh idk! I’ll have to see what my schedule is like then” “i probably have to work” and jokingly I was like “oh, well it’s not until next year so you have plenty of time to fit me in your schedule now haha” and she still had a “we will see” answer.. I’m kinda getting this gut feeling she’s not going to show up to the wedding. Which still hurts to think about but maybe i deserve it. I just hate how she cant understand where i was coming from and forgive me considering it was a few years ago now. Am I setting double standards? Please help.. nicely I’m just a girl 🥲. ",1,1768630364.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I don't want to restrict or loose weight, in fact I am terrified to loose a ton of weight because I was hospitalized for it in the past and it was quite traumatizing. 

My whole life I have been a picky eater as I only like very basic and bland types of foods. The foods I absolutely avoid and hate are tomatoes, any sort of sauces, I hate soups, curry or anything like that, any sort of 'complex' looking foods or mixed foods. I don't know what is wrong with me but I am a 25 year old woman and I am highly embarrassed to go out and eat dinner in public or even with other people, like going on a dinner-date is terrifying to me. 

In March of 2025, I got a job working at a hospital doing housekeeping and laundry, and it can be quite a physical type of job so some days I am sweating and using up a lot of energy. I started to notice how little I actually eat at work when I saw how much my coworkers eat at work in comparison to me. Then they started to notice themselves and then I started to get little comments like ""boy you sure don't eat much do ya?"", ""did you bring a lunch today?"", ""you better eat something, I haven't seen you eat one thing today"". Usually them saying those thing actually reminds me that ""oh shit I actually haven't eaten anything in a long time"". I don't blame them, I sit with them every day for our coffee and lunch breaks, so it's kind of noticeable when I have nothing on the table and everyone is eating lunches.  
  
I don't know why I am like this but I would really appreciate any sort of advice or something, idk, I'm just struggle really bad and I know I need to fuel my body with food, especially when I am working a physically demanding job and in a healthcare environment.

Things were going well overall until this past week, when I was suddenly ghosted.

On Thursday, Jan 8th, we had a conversation about where things were going, and he said we were moving in the direction of a relationship. During that conversation, I explained that communication and consistency are very important to me. Because he travels for work and I work second shift, we usually only see each other on weekends. I told him that I don’t need to talk all day, but I do need a short period of intentional connection daily (around 20 minutes of focused conversation). We didn’t agree on specific expectations, just talked generally.

On Friday, Jan 9th around noon, he stopped responding to me completely.

Later, I found out that his aunt passed away suddenly. He did not tell me this himself, I found out because I work with his cousin and it was being discussed at work. On Saturday, Jan 10th, I sent him a brief text saying I was sorry for his loss and that he didn’t need to respond, but that I wanted him to know I was thinking of him.

It has now been a full 7 days with no communication at all.

A couple more things that may matter:

	•	He has said he doesn’t really like texting

	•	He hasn’t been in a relationship in about 6 years

I understand that grief can make people withdraw, but I’m struggling with whether it’s reasonable to completely stop communicating with someone you’re potentially moving toward a relationship with, especially after a conversation about communication needs.

So my question is:

Do I make one last effort and tell him I’ll be at a coffee shop tomorrow from 9–10 if he wants to talk?

Or do I take the silence as my answer and move on?

I want to be compassionate, but I also don’t want to ignore my own needs or chase someone who isn’t willing or able to communicate.",1,1768630071.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qf5c3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/FattyLiverNAFLD/comments/1qf5c3s/looking_for_some_guidance_and_encouragement/,Looking for some guidance and encouragement.,"I'm just a little frustrated and overwhelmed and trying to remain positive but having trouble. sorry if this is long I'll try to be succinct.

I got diagnosed a couple years ago and I did what the nutritionist and doctor told me, but they didn't really explain what NAFLD was or what the restrictions were. My doctor just told me to try to lose weight, and the nutritionist said don't have refined sugar or salt and eat whole grains, they said I could eat cheese and milk and artificial sweetener just not in large portions.

I didn't lose enough weight in the first year as I assumed that would happen with the change in diet. I also didn't understand how strict I needed to be because they explained literally nothing (I didn't even know it was called NAFLD for a long time, they just told me I had inflammation).

Anyway, I had some life upheaval that kept me from really focusing on weight loss and it's progressed. I started having some symptoms like abdominal discomfort and some pain. got an MRI and found out my liver was 39% inflamed.

So I took the weight loss part more seriously (I honestly thought I was doing well I'd cut out almost all sugar and sodium), and I started to lose weight by just eliminating things from my diet (why eat grains if you are trying to lose weight? etc...) so I started losing weight and then the pain got worse.

I got more serious and started doing a lot more research instead of just relying on what my doctor said (which I should have done initially, but I didn't even know what the condition was at first) and started cutting things out I found could be harmful. oranges apparently too high in sugar, artificial sweetener also bad and a lot of artificially sweetened things that are ""sugar free"" actually have sugar in them or sugar alcohols which may be worse.

I lost more weight and the pain has gone away mostly and it's back to a mild sensation sometimes, which I'm assuming is related to change in diet and a good sign.

but now I'm finding out you can lose weight too fast and hurt your liver by processing too much stored fat!!!

So I guess I need to eat more, but still lose weight as fast as I can just not too fast???

I'm just bewildered honestly. I feel like I keep trying to do the right thing and finding out it's wrong and I'm just overwhelmed and feeling a little hopeless. I've only really started to understand this disease recently so it's all just hitting me at once and I'm having a hard time keeping a positive outlook or being hopeful. I know there are no guarantees here. Thin people can have NAFLD too, I'm just hoping to have a future without pain and some normalcy without my liver failing on me.

So I could use some words of encouragement and maybe some guidance.

AI says my calorie deficit should be around 1000 a day. I am shorter and tend to gain weight at a 2000 calorie diet so I'm assuming I should aim for 800 to 1000, but now I'm scared of eating too much or too little.

I also keep seeing stuff about coffee being good but I'm always skeptical of claims like that and I don't really like caffeine. I also hear fatty fish like salmon are good but, but I honestly don't know what information to trust.

Anyway that's my rant. I feel really lost and confused and am struggling with any kind of optimism.

1qf58oz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qf58oz,Which danish cookbook to choose? And a few questions about Copenhagen!,"Hello danish people,

A curious question: I am in Athens/Greece at the moment and found a lovely coffee roaster called Foyer Espresso Bar who also makes desserts and small dishes. They sell a very few cook books and I discovered two and I do not know which one to choose, so I thought I ask you. The Options are:

Apollo state of the art cooking and a party

And

Atelier September

1. I know it is the same author, but if you would have to choose one or the other, which one you prefer and why?

2. pricewise they are 59 Eur. What is the price in Copenhagen? I am asking as I will be in Copenhagen in the middle of February?

3. eating at this place in Copenhagen as a single person how much money shall I bring?

4. concerning Espresso: which Roaster in Cooenhagen does good roman style dark espresso?

5. As I will be in Copenhagen for 3 days soon: which bakery is best for sordough bread and which for pastries (i love anything with Kardamom) and would you have some advices foodwise? Ok, let me give you an example for Hamburg, where I habe been living very long: buy bread from Effenberger, eat a Currywurst at „Imbiss bei Schorsch“ as it is a supersmall place and so good (only five people can stand inside), have thai chicken soup at Thai Imbiss in Bartelsstrasse, eat a Franzbrötchen anywhere (but „Backecht“ uses super ingredients and is one of the best); have a vegetarian dinner at Picolo Paradiso and make a reservation, eat croatian style at Tunici Dobrovnik, and if you like candies then go to Bonscheladen.

6. may I ask three last questions:

Nice sauna with good „Aufgüsse“?

Old cinema not those multiplex centers to be named? 

Best organic supermarket?

Thanks a lot!

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I also have had the previous surgeries over the years. Surgeries include gallbladder/appendix/lap nissens (2). I suffer gastroparesis and was given a pylorotomy (or pyloroplastomy, I can’t recall) about 10 years ago. Also, I’m 4 yrs post partial hysterectomy due to endometriosis and adenomyosis. And I am menopausal. My stomach is bloated daily. It starts smaller and grows as the day goes on. I had a colonoscopy last year, after right lower back and side pain that wouldn’t subside. A 10cm polyp was removed. They told me to check back in 5 years. 

Today has been rough. And it’s not like all of the other times my stomach has betrayed me. This morning I woke up, feeling more rested than usual. I had my usual cup of coffee and a banana. After about an hour, I had diarrhea. Urgent and a lot. Then I had another immediately after. Mostly mucus looking and clearish. About an hour later, another large amount. But more small soft globs (for lack of a better word). This one felt like it would keep coming even though there was nothing happening. It also created a fullness and pressure in both my anus and vaginal area. It made me feel like I had to urinate/and empty my bowels still. But I couldn’t. When I tried, what little urine that came out, burned, like a UTI.  After each time I became exhausted. I slept deep. I would get cold, fall asleep and then wake up drenched. Ever since it began, I have felt awful right lower back pain.

1qf4y7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qf4y7z/prophetic_pages/,Prophetic Pages,"It was a rainy Saturday morning, and I could hear the rain tapping against my window. I looked up from my laptop and let out a soft sigh.

The sound was somewhat annoying, yet also oddly soothing, and I thought it might help me focus on the history essay I needed to finish for school.

As I kept typing away on my laptop, I suddenly heard yelling and shouting. I paused, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, and groaned quietly to myself.

""Not again.""

I got up from my bed and walked out of my room, heading down the hall and downstairs, where the yelling grew louder.

As I turned the corner, I spotted my Mom and older brother Mark in the living room, arguing about something.

""Mom, I already told you I'm sorry! I should have called to let you know I’d be home late. I didn’t realize that party would go on until one in the morning!""

""And I’ve already told you that I don’t like you or your brother being out that late! Something terrible could have happened to you! For heaven's sake, you could have been killed or kidnapped, Marcus!""

Mom and Mark continued their argument, clearly oblivious to my presence. I sighed softly, contemplating whether to just turn around and let them sort it out.

Even though I was twenty-five and Mark was twenty-seven, Mom still treated us like children. She insisted we stay with her until we were both thirty, which infuriated us.

I felt a surge of frustration rising within me, and I cleared my throat as loudly as I could, causing Mom and Mark to stop arguing. They both turned to look at me.

""Oh my goodness, Daniel! I’m so sorry! Did we interrupt your studying?"" Mom asked, sounding genuinely concerned.

""I've been attempting to study for more than an hour, but I can't concentrate with you two bickering like children!""

Mark's face flushed a deep red; I could tell he was embarrassed about the situation, yet he was still angry with Mom and wouldn't cease his argument until he had expressed everything he wanted to say.

""We're sorry, sweetheart. I'm just trying to explain to your brother that staying out late isn't wise,"" Mom said.

I've always disliked that particular trait of Mom's—she's such a worrywart, if that's the right term, because she frets over everything, even the most trivial matters.

""You know what? I'll just head to the library. Maybe I can finish my essay there, and hopefully, there won't be anyone trying to tear each other apart!""

I nearly yelled the last part out of frustration as I turned and stormed back upstairs to my room to grab my things.

As I shoved my laptop and notebook into my bag, I muttered under my breath about the constant fighting and how I felt treated like a child.

Just as I was about to leave, I heard a knock on my bedroom door. I turned to see Mark leaning against the doorframe; I hadn't even noticed him come up behind me.

""Let me guess, Mom sent you up here to stop me from heading to the library,"" I remarked, glancing at him.

""Yep, she believes it's a terrible idea for you to go outside in this rainstorm because you might get sick or even struck by lightning, which is ridiculous, but she wouldn't listen when I told her that.""

I rolled my eyes and plopped down on my bed, slipping on my shoes and ensuring the straps were snug but not so tight that they were cutting into my feet.

""Honestly, I don't care what the worrywart or you think. I'm going to the library to finish my darn history essay without having to listen to another argument from either of you. Now, if you could do me a favor and tell Mom I'll be back before dinner, that would be great,"" I retorted.

Before my brother could respond, I got up, tossed my bag over my shoulder, and pushed past him, making my way downstairs to the main part of the house.

Mom was there, clearly waiting for me. I raised my hand to signal that I didn't want to hear her lecture and assured her I'd be home by dinner before stepping out onto the porch.

The only sounds I could hear were the rain and the rumbling thunder. I let out a soft sigh, double-checking that my bag was securely closed, then pulled up my hoodie and set off toward the city library.

""Who would have thought a library would be open on a weekend?""

After a few minutes of walking along the rain-soaked street, feeling the droplets on my head and back, I found myself in front of the library, a smile creeping onto my face.

The library always brought me joy; there was something magical about the aroma of aged paper and the soft murmurs of books that captivated me.

As I entered the library, I greeted the woman at the front desk. She returned my greeting with a smile, though I could sense she wasn't thrilled to see me looking so drenched.

I located a spot to settle down, and a few minutes later, my belongings were spread out on the desk as I began working on my essay.

In fact, my laptop remained tucked away in my bag while I attempted to proofread my notes before transferring them. I sighed quietly, frustrated that nothing seemed to make sense, and realized I needed some assistance.

I got up and approached the front desk, inquiring if there were any history encyclopedias available that could aid me with my school essay.

She informed me that all the history encyclopedias were located in the back corner of the library and advised me to be cautious while I was there since some of those books were quite ancient.

I nodded in agreement and made my way to the back corner. Upon arrival, I began to sift through the aisles, but all the books appeared either dull or I was certain they wouldn't be of any assistance to me.

Before long, I turned a corner and stumbled upon a section I had never seen before. It looked rather intimidating, as the overhead light was flickering and swaying back and forth.

I noticed a layer of dust on the shelf, and a few bugs scurried out from the shadows, rushing past me. I glanced at all the encyclopedias and couldn't help but smile.

""Perhaps one of these could be useful to me,"" I thought, grinning.

I began to pull encyclopedias off the shelf, examining their covers. Some I had read previously, while others were quite old, likely published when my mom was my age.

As I pushed one encyclopedia aside, something heavy tumbled down onto my foot, causing me to cry out in pain. I quickly slapped a hand over my mouth, not wanting to disrupt the tranquility.

I looked down and saw a thick, brown book lying on the ground. I bent down to pick it up and noticed it lacked any library codes or markings indicating ownership.

However, I soon realized how worn and tattered it was; the spine was cracked. I dusted off the cover and read the title, which sent a shiver down my spine.

""Prophetic Pages""

I opened the book and began flipping through the pages, each one yellowed with age and filled with handwritten notes and strange symbols that seemed to dance before my eyes.

As I continued to flip through the pages, I discovered that each one contained a detailed entry about the life and death of an individual. It struck me that the names were eerily familiar.

They were all people I knew—friends, family, acquaintances. I was in disbelief over what I was holding. When I turned to the next page, I nearly dropped the book on my feet once more.

""Timothy Green - Age 23 - Dies in a car accident on April 15th, 2023""

This page was dedicated to my childhood best friend, Timothy, or Tim, as I called him.

April 15th was tomorrow, and I could feel my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. I closed the book, trying to convince myself that this was just a cruel joke.

I glanced around the library, half-expecting someone to jump out and shout, ""Got you!"" But the aisles were empty. The only sounds were the rain tapping against the nearby window and my heavy breathing.

I came to the realization that I had to hurry home to call Tim and alert him about what was going to happen. I tucked the strange book under my arm and dashed back to the desk where my belongings were.

A few minutes later, I found myself sprinting down the street as fast as a guy who mainly plays video games and practices the trumpet can manage.

I began to ponder a multitude of thoughts: was any of this real? Was the book some sort of cursed object that the library had been concealing?

Upon arriving home, I rushed past Mark and Mom, who were in the kitchen preparing dinner. Thankfully, I didn’t hear them arguing, but I didn’t have the luxury of time to deal with that right now.

Once I reached my room, I tossed my bag and the Prophetic Pages book onto my desk, then grabbed my phone from the nightstand.

Without delay, I dialed Tim's number, my fingers trembling as the phone rang and rang. Just when I thought he wouldn’t pick up, I heard his voice on the other end.

""Dude, you need to listen to me; this is really important. Are you planning to go out tonight?"" I asked him.

Timothy excitedly explained that he was actually going to see a new horror movie that had just been released and suggested I join him if I was done being Mr. History.

I took a deep breath and pleaded with him to stay home, urging him not to drive anywhere and to just remain safe at home. Tim immediately laughed, teasing me about turning into my mother.

I was on the verge of telling him about the peculiar book I discovered at the library, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. Just then, I heard Mom calling my name, so I told Tim I had to go, and he hung up.

I let out a soft sigh before glancing down at the Prophetic Pages book. Deep down, I feared it might already be too late for my childhood best friend.

I heard Mom calling my name again, so I set my phone back on the nightstand. I then walked out of my room and saw Mom standing at the foot of the stairs.

She informed me that dinner was ready and that she had been calling for me for two minutes, urging me to come downstairs before my food got cold.

At the table, I sat there pushing my peas around my plate with a fork while Mom and Mark were engaged in conversation, but I was focused on them.

My mind was occupied with thoughts of the dangerous book from the library, Tim's disbelief, and the looming possibility of losing my best friend, either tomorrow or maybe even tonight.

""Hey little bro, what's up with you?"" Mark inquired.

I jumped in my seat, nearly falling out, but I managed to keep my composure because I knew if I hit the ground, Mom would treat me like a little baby.

""Oh, I'm just pondering my history essay. I found some intriguing information at the library, and I think it will help me score a good grade,""

I couldn't share the details about the so-called death book because neither of them would believe me, especially since Tim never believed me when I warned him about his fate.

After dinner, I headed back to my room, sat on the bed, grabbed the book, and flipped to the page detailing Tim's death.

I kept staring at it, wondering if it was real or if I could tear the page out and somehow prevent it from happening, like some sort of paradox.

But then I remembered that this book was indeed from the library, and I had borrowed it, yet it lacked any library barcodes or scanning tags, so perhaps it didn't actually belong to the library.

I let out a soft sigh before placing the book on my nightstand, getting ready for bed, and soon I was lying in the dark bedroom, thinking about Tim and the terrible car accident that awaited him on April 15th.

The next morning, as I woke up, sunlight streamed through my window. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and yawned. Instantly, I turned around, glancing at my phone, my thoughts immediately drifting to Tim.

I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I quickly grabbed my phone and texted Tim, checking if he was alright and if he had enjoyed the movie. I anticipated a swift response, but there was nothing.

Throughout the day, I kept waiting for Tim to either call or text me, but still, no reply came. Panic began to creep in, and I muttered in frustration under my breath.

I made the decision to call Tim's home phone. However, instead of him picking up, it was his mother. When I inquired about Timothy's whereabouts, I heard her gasp in horror.

She informed me that Tim had been involved in a car accident while driving to the grocery store, and the paramedics said he didn’t survive.

In that moment, I felt my legs buckle beneath me. I leaned against the wall, sliding down until I collapsed onto the floor.

The Prophetic Pages had spoken the truth, and it had come to pass. The book had foretold his death, and despite my efforts, I couldn’t save my best friend from dying.

The very next day, I found myself back at the library, enveloped in a fog of sorrow and disbelief, desperate to comprehend what had just transpired.

I settled into the same desk as before, retrieving the book from my bag, gazing at it before I began to leaf through the yellowed pages once more.

Each page contained a meticulous account of the life and death of various individuals; some were familiar to me, while others were not. Yet, each entry represented a friend or family member who would meet their end in unique circumstances, all described in vivid detail.

As I continued to turn the pages, I suddenly halted on one that sent a chill through my hands, almost compelling me to hurl the book across the room.

""Jessica Carter - Age 25 - Dies from an aneurysm on April 16th, 2023""

In that moment, I understood that this page detailed the death of my girlfriend, Jessica.

A shiver coursed through me as I recalled the last time I saw Jessica; we were at the coffee shop, sharing laughter over something silly.

Without hesitation, I jumped up, stuffed the book into my bag, and fished my phone out of my pocket to dial Jessica's number.

""Hey Daniel, what's up? I'm at work right now,"" her voice came through.

""Listen, whatever you're doing, you need to stop or head home. You're in danger!""

I rushed to explain about the book I discovered in the library, detailing how it revealed the deaths of all my friends and family, including her.

I then told her I found Tim's name in the book, and that he died in a car accident yesterday, just as the book predicted for that exact date.

""Whoa, Daniel, I think you've been watching too many horror movies. But when you get to the restaurant, at least bring me that so-called mystical book you have,"" Jessica said before hanging up.

I felt an urge to scream into the emptiness. I urged my feet to run, wishing I had brought my car or something quicker than my clumsy feet. When I finally reached the restaurant, I doubled over, gasping for breath.

As I looked up, I saw a crowd gathered around the entrance, and confusion washed over me. Were they having a sale, or was there a fight going on?

I was indifferent to the commotion; my only focus was finding Jessica to show her the book. I squeezed through the throng and entered the restaurant, where I noticed paramedics and medical personnel, along with an area cordoned off by barriers.

I couldn't see what was happening due to another crowd blocking my view, so I tapped an older man on the shoulder. He turned to me, concern etched on his face.

""Sir, what’s going on?""

""One of the workers just collapsed, and the paramedics think she’s dead,"" he replied.

The moment he mentioned 'she,' my heart plummeted. I pushed through the crowd, and there on the ground, eyes closed and lifeless, lay Jessica.

""No, Jessica!"" I yelled, my voice echoing in the chaos.

Instantly, the paramedics and medical staff turned to me. One approached and asked if I knew her.

I told her I was Jessica's boyfriend, that I had just spoken to her on the phone moments ago, urging her to leave work because it wasn't safe. I was rambling, overwhelmed, and I stopped when the paramedic placed her hands on my shoulders.

""Young man, it’s okay. You should know what happened. Your girlfriend has died from an aneurysm, and there was nothing we could do to save her. I’m so sorry,"" the paramedic said.

The book felt like a dark oracle, revealing its grim secrets, and I thought about showing it to this woman. But if I did, she would likely bombard me with questions I couldn’t answer.

So, I thanked her and, without another word, pushed past everyone and exited the restaurant, furious that this cursed book had claimed yet another person I loved.

Weeks later, the unsettling pattern persisted; each page revealed the demise of a victim who was more familiar to me than Jessica.

I had become a captive of the book, unable to resist the allure of its sinister knowledge. It felt as if it understood my sorrow, with the ink appearing darker on every page.

Then, I stumbled upon a page that shattered my heart into countless fragments upon seeing the name of the individual.

""Marcus Roberts - Age 27 - Died of a heart attack on April 30th 2023""

I realized that was tonight once again, and I leaped out of bed, rushing to brother's room, where I found him lacing up his shoes.

""Dude, where are you going? It's almost nine o'clock at night?""

""Can’t sleep. Thinking about going for a late-night run. Be back soon.""

I pleaded with him not to venture outside tonight, insisting it was too perilous. Mark chuckled, saying I was becoming like Mom, but I was just terrified of losing my brother.

After an hour had passed, I found myself in the kitchen assisting Mom in preparing her renowned double chocolate chip cookies, and I could see that she appeared anxious about something.

I inquired about what was troubling her, and she revealed that Mark had not returned from his walk nor had he sent her a message as he had promised to do when he was on his way back home.

I sensed what was about to unfold, and I knew I had to intervene. I looked at Mom and told her I needed to take care of something urgent, to which she simply nodded in agreement.

Without another word, I quickly put on my jacket and shoes, then dashed out of the house. My breath came in quick, uneven gasps as I sprinted toward the park, Mark's favorite place to walk.

As I neared the park, I spotted a figure lurking in the shadows, and my heart raced in my chest. When I turned the corner, I found him lying on the ground, clutching his chest.

""MARK!"" I yelled.

I hurried to my brother, but deep down, I already knew it was too late for him. That dreadful book had taken yet another victim, and this time, it was my brother.

I was descending into madness; first, my two friends were taken from me, and then my brother. The loss of my loved ones was a heavy burden on my emotions.

That’s when an idea struck me. I seized the book and made my way back to the library one last time, desperate for answers. The main librarian, an elderly woman, looked up at me with her piercing green eyes.

""What is this book? Why is it causing all of this?"" 

I slammed the Prophetic Pages onto the desk. Initially, the lady remained silent, but as she took the book and examined it, her expression shifted, and she regarded me with a serious look.

""Young man, where did you come across this book?"" 

""I was here last time searching for history encyclopedias when this book fell off the shelf and landed on my foot. But you still haven’t answered my question: what is this book?!"" 

""That’s the Prophetic Pages. It has always existed, young man. It chronicles the lives that are intertwined with yours and predicts not only death but also the weight of the choices and paths we take,"" the librarian clarified.

""This isn’t a choice; it’s a curse!"" I shouted in frustration.

""Perhaps it is, or perhaps it isn’t. But understand this: that book only reveals what is already destined. It’s not the cause but a reflection of the choices you’ve made and the connections you’ve established,"" she replied.

I took a step back, my mind racing. Had I somehow cursed all those deaths of my loved ones without realizing it? 

Was I in some way accountable for the choices they made or the paths they chose? 

""Can I change this? Is there any way to stop it"" I inquired.

""The only way to put an end to this situation is to cut off the connections, but it comes at a cost, young man.""

Her words seemed to penetrate deep within me, and without uttering a single word, I turned away from the desk, leaving my book behind in the library.

I came to the realization that I had to create distance from everyone I cared about. I needed to sever ties with them, even though it felt like a betrayal; it was the only way to protect them all.

In the following weeks, I dedicated my days and nights to solitude. Whenever I encountered someone I recognized, I would steer clear of them, and I ignored their calls and messages.

This was torturous, yet it brought a sense of relief as I observed that no one around me was perishing, and I felt assured that my loved ones were safe.

Then one day, as I went to my bedroom to indulge in some video games, I discovered the Prophetic Pages book lying on my bed, and I felt as if I could melt into a puddle.

I hurried over to it, picked it up, and as I examined the cover, my hands trembled while I opened the book and flipped straight to the last page.

To my surprise, it was entirely blank, leaving me puzzled. Recalling what the librarian had said, I touched the paper and watched in amazement as the information began to materialize before my eyes.

When I saw the name of the next person destined to die, my jaw dropped in disbelief.

Daniel Roberts - 25 years old - Passed away from loneliness on May 15, 2023

The book slipped from my grasp; that date was tomorrow. I couldn't fathom it. I felt as if I might either vomit or weep like a child.

The realization hit me like a massive wave. I had been so focused on saving my friends and loved ones that I had unwittingly sealed my own doom.

I needed to cut myself off entirely from everyone, even my mother, who was thankfully still alive. But I was destined to become a mere ghost.

A mere shadow of who I used to be. This book had twisted my intentions, transforming my wish to protect into a sentence of death.

The following day, I found myself sitting alone on the floor of my bedroom, feeling the darkness creeping in, coiling around me like a serpent.

I reminisced about my friends and brothers, recalling the laughter and memories we had created together. It dawned on me that I had forsaken them all, and in doing so, I had condemned myself.

Mom attempted to coax me out of my room, but nothing she said had any effect. As night descended, I sensed the air becoming thick and oppressive.

Suddenly, I heard whispers—likely from that dreadful book—echoing in my mind, the pages shifting as if they were alive.

I let out a soft sigh, rising to my feet and moving to my nightstand where the Prophetic Pages lay. I began flipping through the book, only to find it completely blank, and I realized I was about to join them.

I shut the book and hurled it to the ground, confronting the horrifying truth: I had become a prisoner of my own decisions, a victim of fate. As the sudden darkness enveloped me, I grasped the meaning of it all.

The real terror did not stem from the foretold deaths but from the isolation I had chosen to accept.

But now it was too late. I had become a new edition of the Prophetic Pages, destined for a solitary conclusion. As I sank into the shadows, I finally understood how to escape the curse of the Prophetic Pages.",1,1768628375.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

When I started with specialty coffee, my first 100% arabica selection was Blue Tokai's Vienna Roast. It was the right pick; to this day, Vienna is my favourite by far. It tastes just like a coffee with milk (and sugar!) should.

Ever since, I have tried different Viennas, looking for the best and also the best value for money. Here are the ones I've tried and my ranking:

1. **Fraction 9**: At least as good as BT, it wins the top spot due to consistency and price.
2. **Blue Tokai**: Excellent Vienna; really in a blind test I couldn't tell it from F9. Has become more expensive though.
3. **Bombay Island**: I tried only once. I remember it as good but not as good as #1 and 2. As seems to happen often, after I tried it the first time, they raised their prices, so I haven't gone back.
4. **Hermit Coffee**: This is my current bag. Of the list, it's the cheapest of all, however it's a lesser grade of bean, and the roast is somewhat uneven. Still, it's not bad, and the price is very good (though F9 with a coupon isn't that much more).
5. **Devan's ""Viennese"" Blend**: While I know many are fond of Devan's, this isn't a true Vienna roast; it's a medium-dark blend. I have to rank it far below the other four. It just doesn't measure up.

I bonded with a girl I met a while back. And saw things that made me think she was amazing. She was obviously beautiful to me. But I saw past that, and actually ginuinely liked her for qualities I felt I saw at the time.

We had one argument. Which I apologized for. But after that, I noticed a lot of things that were questionable to me. And lately our text conversations have been odd too -

She texted me “Merry Christmas”. When I asked what she got, I was left on read.

She mentioned getting coffee. I followed up, she said she’d be heading to the coffee place we had in mind to see what day works with her next week. It was closed (it really was). So she texted me while she was home. And sent a very attractive photo of her and her new dog. And a video of her dancing with her chest. Which I was surprised by. Not in a good way. I complemented her smile, said Im glad to see her happy and said good night.

I asked about an update on meeting for coffee. She later said she’s working on a goal until the 15th. And after that she can.

I sent a Bible verse to her. And she told me what she was reading. I asked what her thoughts were. And she said “I will share with you today. I’m doing a fasting and download and do a study on it today.” And never did.

Days later, she indirectly asked to use my credit, to run an AirBNB. Asking if I knew anyone with good credit. And ironically offered my exact rent price to use it. Saying it would be an opportunity for passive income with other properties.I declined politely. And I followed up with a statement she made about unconditional love a while back. And asked how she was really feeling, business aside. (She has run a successful concierge business)

She texted “ Just reading I’ll respond once I’m back from dinner”. And didnt say anything that night.

The next day she sent a voice message asking how Im doing. And called me by my nickname. Which was something actually personable. And we chatted, I showed the car Im renting, and she asked what I was renting it for. When I took a while to respond, she said “I’ll text you when I’m done at this event”

I obviously know that’s not happening.

What is the purpose of this behavior? Is it retaliatory? Is it because she thinks I like her and trying to manipulate? Or just not opening up emotionally because she’s afraid of getting hurt? If shes just using me, and I said no to credit, why keep things open at this point? Or even respond to my text.

I'm 19F I have been going to the gym since I was 15.
When I started, I was around 93 kg. After two years of consistent workouts, discipline, and changing my lifestyle, I came down to 65 kg. It was not easy, but I was proud of myself.
Like many girls, I always admired those gym fits influencers wear. V neck sports bras, fitted leggings, outfits that show confidence and strength.

 Last year, I finally felt like I had earned the right to wear them. I was in shape, comfortable with my body, and confident.
That confidence lasted exactly until I stepped outside.
The moment I walked out of my house, I could feel the stares. Not subtle glances. Full on staring. And yes, it was my cleavage.
And honestly, what even is cleavage? It is literally just the space between two organs. Mine are not even big. So what is so shocking about it?
Men old enough to be my father, 40 to 50 year old uncles, some with bigger chests than me, were staring, laughing, and passing comments among themselves. What stunned me the most was that they did not even try to hide it. Just straight up staring like it was their right.
What made it worse was realizing that younger guys were actually less creepy. These older men were on another level.
I ignored it and kept going. I did not want to let them win.
After about a week of working out in those outfits, a man in his late 30s approached me at the gym and said, ""You look hot. Want to go out for coffee?""
I told him my age
He replied, ""Age does not matter if there is consent.""
I was stunned. What the hell is wrong with people?
He kept pushing even after I said no. That was it for me.
Since then, I have gone back to oversized T shirts and loose lowers. Not because I suddenly hate my body, but because I am tired. Tired of being stared at, sexualized, and made uncomfortable just for existing in a space meant for self improvement.
I worked hard for my body. I did not work this hard to be treated like an object.

Alam ko medyo loser na to still live in the past. Happy naman ako ngayon, don’t get me wrong, pero minsan gusto ko lang talaga ma-experience ulit yung vibe noon. Since 2026 na, naisip ko lang i-recall.

For me, 2016 was the best year ever, Pokémon Go everywhere, EDMs, Chainsmokers and Alan Walker nonstop, GSW blew a 3–1 lead lol, Kimi no Nawa sa sinehan… it honestly felt like the closest we’ve gotten to world peace lol. Parang ang gaan talaga ng mundo non, as if we were all in sync kahit sandali lang. 

Fast forward, isa sa mga solo trips ko sa Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. First time kong mag-travel mag-isa. Pag-check in ko sa hostel, ako lang nasa room. Habang nakahiga, iniisip ko pa lang kung anong una kong gagawin, biglang may pumasok na girl. Halatang galing sa stressful na situation, mabilis yung hinga niya, hawak mahigpit yung bag, parang nagulat pa siya na may tao sa room.

Lumapit siya at sabi, muntik na raw siyang ma-snatch-an ng purse. Buti na lang hindi nakuha at hindi rin siya nasaktan. Kita ko sa mata niya yung takot pero pinipilit niyang maging okay. Pinakalma ko siya, sabi ko if gusto pa niyang ipagpatuloy ang kanyang travel, baka wag na lang niya muna sabihin sa parents niya, baka pauwiin siya agad. Napangiti siya, natawa ng konti, parang gumaan yung atmosphere.

Nagpakilala siya, let’s call her Nikki. American,   Japanese parents. She was 20, on a gap year before mag-college. She wasn’t the “wow, super model” type, pero meron siyang presence na hindi mo basta-basta malilimutan. Slim, maputi, long black hair, naka-glasses. Yung tipong kahit stressed, maganda pa ring tingnan. May simplicity na striking.

Habang unti-unti siyang kumakalma, nilabas niya Oreos, sabay alok sa akin. Tumanggi ako kasi nahihiya, pero natawa siya, “Haven’t really met anyone who refused an Oreo, haha!” Tumawa na lang din ako, and just like that, nag-flow na usapan namin. Kwento about life, travel, bakit siya nasa Vietnam. Hanggang sa niyaya ko na rin siyang lumabas para mawala yung bad vibes niya. 

Wala kaming specific plans, so nag-explore na lang kami ng city. Café hopping sa paligid ng Phạm Ngũ Lão, tasting all the small pastries and iced coffee. Ang init ng araw, but the smells of fresh bread and street foods made it feel alive. Sa park, we sat on the bench, watched kids play and adults exercise, and just talked. Medyo awkward ako at first kasi mahiyain ako, hoy! imagine, last na girl na nakausap ko seriously was my high school ex pa, 2010 yun lol! Pero later on, naging comfortable na.

That night, nag-dinner kami sa isang maliit na eatery sa gilid ng kalsada. Plastic stools, maingay ang motor sa paligid, ilaw ng signage na kumikindat-kindat. Umorder kami ng bún bò Huế, beef noodle soup na parehong first time naming tikman. Tahimik lang kami habang kumakain, sabay tingin at tawa kasi nag-struggle ako sa chopsticks at dumudulas ang noodles lol.

Pagbalik sa hostel, hindi pa kami nauubosan ng energy. Lumabas pa kami ulit, bar hopping naman. Doon mas naging personal yung usapan, she told me how she hustled just to fund her trip, her big dreams, the things that scared her, even stories about our past relationships. Ang saya kasi hindi siya nag-hold back, and for once, I felt like someone actually wanted to hear me too. Naglaro pa kami ng foosball, tag-team against other travelers, then one-on-one. Sa dami ng tao sa bar, pakiramdam ko kami lang yung naririnig ng isa’t isa.

Umuwi kami magkahawak-kamay. Walang kiss, walang anything alasjuicy, wag kang ano jan, HAHAHA. Pero masaya.

The next day, instead of sticking to separate plans, nag-decide kaming mag-stay pa together sa HCM. Nag-book kami ng private room and nag explore ulit ng city since 2PM pa naman ang check-in time. Museum ng Ho Chi Minh first, the air-conditioning felt like heaven after the heat outside. She kept leaning a bit closer while reading the plaques, and I realized I wanted to know everything about her. Next, Notre-Dame Cathedral, its redish pink bricks glowing under the morning sun. We took photos together, I also took candid photos of her on my phone. Then, the post office, huge vaulted ceilings, intricate designs. Sa bawat building, ang dami naming natutunan, pero mas gusto ko yung kwentuhan namin habang naglalakad sa paligid, holding hands across street crossings, laughing at tiny mistakes in pronunciation.

That night nag decide kami mag party ulit hehehe syempre hindi mawawala ang walwal lol, habang sumasayaw kami sa club, duon nangyari yung first kiss namin, first kiss ko din ito. Awkward, sloppy, but full of laughter, excitement, and that electric connection you only feel once in a lifetime.

The next few days, ganoon lang routine namin. Explore sa umaga, window shopping sa Bến Thành Market, café hopping, street foods, herbs, grilled meat, lemongrass, spices na ang lakas ng aroma. She laughed at me trying to figure out how to eat some local snacks, wala kasing toothpick yung snail nila kaya ang hirap kainin lol. Pagdating ng gabi, night market, neon lights, tawanan, ingay ng mga tao sa street at motorbikes. Hawak kamay habang naglalakad sa madaming tao sa Bùi Viện Walking Street. Hindi na kailangan ng maraming activities, sapat na yung presence ng isa’t isa. Honestly, it felt like time stopped. The city was ours. I was full of life.

Pero dumating din yung inevitable. Kailangan ko nang bumalik ng Pinas, siya naman may flight papuntang Da Nang, this flight was actually rebooked, hehe, kasi binago niya yung plans para mag-match sa schedule ko. Sabay kami sa airport, at hindi na napigilang maluha bago maghiwalay. Hinawakan niya kamay ko ng mahigpit, parang ayaw ko nang pakawalan. Niyakap ko siya ng mahigpit, hanggang sa parang gusto ko nang i-freeze yung oras.

Before we finally let go, we shared our last kiss, quick, awkward, sweet, and full of everything we hadn’t said over the past few days in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam.

Yung flight pabalik ng Manila, sobrang bigat. Kahit nasa bus na ako pauwi, naiiyak pa rin ako, hahaha!

It wasn’t just a travel fling. Hindi lang basta fleeting excitement or kilig. That was the time I felt the deepest connection with someone, sa pinaka-unexpected na place, at sa pinaka-unexpected na moment. There’s something different, almost magical, about meeting someone when you’re both strangers, away from everything familiar. I’ve only ever felt that kind of connection while traveling, when the world feels both vast and intimate at the same time.

Yes, there’s always a price to pay when separation comes. But the memories, they last.

PS:

To Nikki, I know you’ll never read this, but I actually let you win in foosball that night just to see you smile wider, hahaha! Sometimes, I still look at our selfies and remember those days as the happiest time of my life.",1,1768627143.0,AlasFeels,1,1.0,False

I’ve been living in South Beach for about 5 years now, around Flamingo Park. I’ve had AT&T internet that entire time, and it’s been pretty atrocious from day one.

I’ve spent way too many hours researching what providers are available in this area, and it honestly feels like there’s basically nothing. My only options are Breezeline, AT&T, or T-Mobile 5G. No Google Fiber, no AT&T Fiber, no Xfinity fiber; which is brutal.

The connection will be fine for about a week, then I’ll get a few awful days in a row, then it improves, then it’s trash again. Rinse and repeat for 5 years. I’ve more or less learned to live with it. If it’s acting up while I’m working from home (I’m hybrid), I’ll just go to a coffee shop or the library.

I know I sound insane for not having technicians out to check on it, but I’m very much a “live in the moment” person and fuck having to deal with being home from 10 am to 6 pm bc they might come.

I used to work at Starbucks, and about a year in, I got a new coworker who I will call ""Bailey."" 

Bailey was one of those people that is *always* having a bad day. She always had a bad attitude, and was constantly complaining about the latest bad thing that happened to her, whether it was that she couldn't find her favorite hair tie, or her mom was passive aggressive to her. Most of the time it was tiny things, but it was always something.

I am not typically a confrontational person, so I never called her out on any of it and just tried to focus on being positive around her. But I also didn't feel inclined to spend time with her outside of work or anything like that. Most of my coworkers felt the same way.

Just a couple of weeks before my interview for a supervisor position, Bailey decided she wanted to try for the same position. That's fine. A good supervisor is a good supervisor and if she's qualified, there's no reason for her not to try.

As soon as she found out I was also going for the supervisor position (she didn't know I'd been planning on this for months before she even came to our store) she got upset with me and accused me of trying to copy her/push her out. 

I and others reassured her that my decision to do this was made long before she came on the scene and had nothing to do with her. But before we could have the interviews, I had a health scare and ended up backing out of the running. She was the only other candidate, so she automatically got the promotion. 

I truly, genuinely did not feel any jealousy or insecurity about it. I didn't like her attitude, but she didn't give me any reason to think she'd be a bad supervisor, and I'm not really an ego driven person so I didn't feel in competition with her. When I found out, I congratulated her, and that was that. (Down the road, after my health was stable again, I became a supervisor as well and everything was fine.)

Because she was still new to the store, she had to shadow another supervisor for a while before she could be let loose on her own. One night, she was shadowing one of our supervisors, ""John"", and working in the drive thru window. 

Starbucks likes to hand out samples of new drinks or food, so she was prepping and distributing samples of the new instant coffee (Via was new around this time, if that tells you how long ago this was.)

One crucial thing about handing out samples was that we had to be clear about what was in each sample when we gave them to people. This is for obvious reasons, including food allergies, religious and ethical restrictions, etc.

Bailey decided that the instant coffee tasted crappy without creamer in it and, without John's knowledge, had begun to add creamer to the tiny sample cups. She was then handing these out the window *without telling the customers that she had added dairy to the sample.*

I was alarmed, because I knew this is health hazard, and would leave the store open to a liability suit if something went wrong, so I went to her first and said that we weren't supposed to alter the samples, but that if she did, she needed to let customers know what it is she's handing them to drink. She got testy with me and blew me off.

Normally, I would walk away and let the chips fall where they may, but I know too many people who have violent reactions to dairy, people with certain conditions like diabetes need to know if what they're drinking has sugar in it, and telling them they are just drinking instant coffee isn't giving them all the information. 

Because Bailey was not willing to listen, I went to John and filled him in on what was happening. He immediately rushed over to where Bailey was handing out samples and stopped her, explained exactly what I had just said to her, and she stopped adding creamer to the samples, but wouldn't look at me anymore. I tried to just move on as though things were normal, so as to not make her uncomfortable.

A little while later, she went to the back and I followed her for totally unrelated reasons. I started to ask her a question about scheduling, and before I got three words out of my mouth, she yelled at me to never speak to her again about anything that isn't necessary for work. I'm not the type to just take aggression laying down, but it's a workplace environment so I bit my tongue and just said ""wow"" and walked away.

After that, Bailey started doing things that almost seemed like deliberate self-sabotage. She would fail to do her job, even though she knew what she needed to do and why, and then played the victim when she got in trouble for not fulfilling her responsibilities. She would pick fights with other baristas, or talk shit about them to the customers out the window. She spread rumors about our boss, and became very hostile over tiny things.

After a couple of weeks, this had escalated so badly that she got into a screaming match with our manager in the middle of the café over a shift that she had missed and not called in for (again, she was a supervisor so this was twice as bad as if she was just a barista). Of course she was fired on the spot.

In the weeks that followed, baristas who did keep up with her told me that she crashed her car under suspicious circumstances, blew up her relationship, and got hired and fired from two jobs in as many months. Everyone in the store knew what a sourpuss she was, and nobody liked her attitude, but we were all shocked to see her spiral this badly. 

Looking back, I have to wonder what was going on with her in her personal life that may have caused her to behave this way, but it's pretty undeniable that the huge shift happened right after I intervened about the instant coffee. 

I wonder sometimes, looking back, if I made the wrong decision by saying anything. AITAH?",8,1768627038.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False
1qf4ik1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsetConqueror/comments/1qf4ik1/how_to_crush_any_interview_the_sciencebased/,How to CRUSH Any Interview: The Science-Based Playbook That Actually Works,"So I used to be TERRIBLE at interviews. like sweating through my shirt, word-vomiting nonsense, leaving and immediately wanting to delete myself from existence, type terrible. Then I spent way too much time researching this (books, psychology podcasts, YouTube deep dives, and actual interview coaches) because I was tired of fumbling opportunities I was qualified for.

Turns out most interview advice is garbage. The ""be yourself"" and ""just relax"" crowd clearly never bombed an interview so badly that they considered faking their own death. But there's actually legit psychology and strategy behind crushing interviews that nobody talks about. This isn't about tricking anyone; it's about presenting your actual value without your anxiety sabotaging you.

  
**1. Reframe what an interview actually is**

Stop treating it like a test you can fail. It's a conversation between two parties trying to figure out a mutual fit. They WANT you to be good. They're tired of interviewing people. Hiring is expensive and annoying. You're potentially solving their problem.

This mental shift alone changes everything. You're not begging for scraps, you're exploring whether this role deserves YOUR time and skills. sounds cocky, but it genuinely makes you more attractive as a candidate because desperation is the most repellent thing you can project.

  
**2. Research like you're writing their biography.**

Spend at least 2 hours researching before any interview. company website, recent news, their LinkedIn, Glassdoor reviews, their competitors, and industry trends. This isn't optional.

Then do something most people skip: research the actual humans interviewing you. Check their LinkedIn, see what they post about, and find common ground. When you can naturally reference something specific in the interview (""I saw you used to work at X company, I'm really interested in how that industry compares to this one""), it shows effort and creates an instant connection.

  
**3. Master the STAR method, but make it not robotic**

Situation, task, action, result. For behavioral questions, this structure is clutch, but everyone uses it so mechanically that it sounds like they're reading a script.

Practice your stories, but tell them like you're explaining to a friend over coffee. Add tiny human details. Instead of ""I managed a team of 5 people,"" say ""I was managing this team of 5 and two of them were NOT getting along, like actively avoiding each other in meetings."" makes it real.

Prepare 6-8 solid stories that cover different skills, leadership, problem-solving, conflict, failure, and innovation. You can remix these for most questions.

  
**4. Your ""tell me about yourself"" answer needs work**

This is the most predictable question, and people still mess it up. Don't recite your resume. They have that. Use this formula:

Brief background (10 seconds), why you're passionate about this field (20 seconds), recent relevant accomplishment (20 seconds), why you're excited about THIS role (10 seconds).

Should be under 90 seconds total. Practice it until it sounds natural, not memorized.

  
**5. Flip the script with YOUR questions**

At the end, when they ask if you have questions, this is not a formality. This is where you either solidify their interest or reveal you don't actually care.

Ask stuff that shows strategic thinking: ""What does success look like in this role after 6 months?"" ""What are the biggest challenges the team is facing right now?"" ""How does this role contribute to the company's main objectives this year?""

Avoid anything you could Google. no ""what does the company do"" type stuff.

One killer question: ""Is there anything about my background or experience that gives you concerns about my fit for this role?"" gives you a chance to address doubts in real time instead of wondering later what went wrong.

  
**6. Body language does half the talking**

Sit up straight but not weirdly rigid. make consistent eye contact (look away occasionally so you're not a psycho). smile when appropriate. nod while they're talking to show engagement.

Match their energy somewhat. If they're more formal, dial yourself back. If they're relaxed and joking, you can loosen up too.

And for the love of god, don't fidget with pens or touch your face constantly. If you need something to do with your hands, rest them on the table or use small, purposeful gestures when talking.

  
**7. The pause is your friend**

When they ask a tough question, it's completely fine to pause for 3-5 seconds before answering. shows you're thoughtful. Rushed answers sound defensive or unprepared.

If you genuinely don't know something, don't try to BS your way through. ""That's not something I've dealt with directly, but here's how I'd approach it"" is way better than making up experience.

  
**8. Strategic vulnerability is powerful**

When they ask about weaknesses (they will), pick something real but not disqualifying. Then immediately talk about how you're actively working on it with specific examples.

""I used to struggle with delegating because I wanted everything done my way, but I've been intentionally giving team members more ownership, and the results have actually been better than when I tried to control everything.""

Shows self-awareness and growth, not just humblebragging disguised as a weakness.

  
**9. Send the follow-up email within 24 hours**

Short, specific, professional. Thank them for their time, reference something specific from your conversation, reiterate your interest, and keep it under 150 words.

This seems basic, but tons of people skip it or send some generic template. personalization matters.

  
**10. Practice out loud with someone**

Reading interview tips is cool. Actually practicing responses out loud is what makes you good. It feels awkward, but it's the difference between knowing what to say and actually being able to say it under pressure.

Get a friend to ask you common questions. Record yourself on your phone. Watch it back and cringe at your filler words and weird pauses. Then do it again until it's smoother.

Couple resources that actually helped: ""[The Interview Question and Answer Book](https://a.co/d/5cnhc2X)"" by James Reed is packed with practical frameworks, not just feel-good nonsense. For understanding the psychology behind what interviewers are really assessing, Laszlo Bock's ""[Work Rules!](https://a.co/d/dSibNsn)"" gives great insight (he was head of people operations at google for a decade).

There's also this YouTube channel called ""[A Life After Layoff](https://www.youtube.com/@ALifeAfterLayoff)"" that breaks down behavioral interview questions in a really practical way. The host is a former corporate recruiter, so he knows what actually matters vs what's just noise.

If you want something more structured, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls insights from career development books, psychology research, and expert interviews to build personalized learning plans. You can tell it something like ""help me prepare for leadership interviews"" or ""improve my communication under pressure,"" and it creates an adaptive plan with podcasts customized to your depth preference, anywhere from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The content connects a lot of the dots between books like the ones mentioned above, plus research on communication psychology and confidence-building. worth checking out if you learn better by audio during commutes or workouts.

One last thing: you're gonna bomb interviews sometimes, even when you do everything right. The fit wasn't there, someone internal got it, budget changed, whatever. doesn't mean you suck at interviews. means that specific thing wasn't meant to work out. Review what you could improve and move forward.

But when you nail one, when you leave feeling like you just had an engaging conversation instead of an interrogation, when they're clearly impressed, and you're genuinely excited about the role, that feeling is unmatched. Interviews can actually be enjoyable once you stop seeing them as something to survive and start seeing them as a chance to showcase what you bring to the table.

1qf4hla,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1qf4hla/2016/,2016,"Maybe it’s just being 20, young, wild and free. Not sure if this belongs here, pero gusto ko lang i-share. Alam ko medyo loser na to still live in the past. Happy naman ako ngayon, don’t get me wrong, pero minsan gusto ko lang talaga ma-experience ulit yung vibe noon. Since 2026 na, naisip ko lang i-recall.

For me, 2016 was the best year ever, Pokémon Go everywhere, EDMs, Chainsmokers and Alan Walker nonstop, GSW blew a 3–1 lead lol, Kimi no Nawa sa sinehan… it honestly felt like the closest we’ve gotten to world peace lol. Parang ang gaan talaga ng mundo non, as if we were all in sync kahit sandali lang. 

Fast forward, isa sa mga solo trips ko sa Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. First time kong mag-travel mag-isa. Pag-check in ko sa hostel, ako lang nasa room. Habang nakahiga, iniisip ko pa lang kung anong una kong gagawin, biglang may pumasok na girl. Halatang galing sa stressful na situation, mabilis yung hinga niya, hawak mahigpit yung bag, parang nagulat pa siya na may tao sa room.

Lumapit siya at sabi, muntik na raw siyang ma-snatch-an ng purse. Buti na lang hindi nakuha at hindi rin siya nasaktan. Kita ko sa mata niya yung takot pero pinipilit niyang maging okay. Pinakalma ko siya, sabi ko if gusto pa niyang ipagpatuloy ang kanyang travel, baka wag na lang niya muna sabihin sa parents niya, baka pauwiin siya agad. Napangiti siya, natawa ng konti, parang gumaan yung atmosphere.

Nagpakilala siya, let’s call her Nikki. American,   Japanese parents. She was 20, on a gap year before mag-college. She wasn’t the “wow, super model” type, pero meron siyang presence na hindi mo basta-basta malilimutan. Slim, maputi, long black hair, naka-glasses. Yung tipong kahit stressed, maganda pa ring tingnan. May simplicity na striking.

Habang unti-unti siyang kumakalma, nilabas niya Oreos, sabay alok sa akin. Tumanggi ako kasi nahihiya, pero natawa siya, “Haven’t really met anyone who refused an Oreo, haha!” Tumawa na lang din ako, and just like that, nag-flow na usapan namin. Kwento about life, travel, bakit siya nasa Vietnam. Hanggang sa niyaya ko na rin siyang lumabas para mawala yung bad vibes niya. 

Wala kaming specific plans, so nag-explore na lang kami ng city. Café hopping sa paligid ng Phạm Ngũ Lão, tasting all the small pastries and iced coffee. Ang init ng araw, but the smells of fresh bread and street foods made it feel alive. Sa park, we sat on the bench, watched kids play and adults exercise, and just talked. Medyo awkward ako at first kasi mahiyain ako, hoy! imagine, last na girl na nakausap ko seriously was my high school ex pa, 2010 yun lol! Pero later on, naging comfortable na.

That night, nag-dinner kami sa isang maliit na eatery sa gilid ng kalsada. Plastic stools, maingay ang motor sa paligid, ilaw ng signage na kumikindat-kindat. Umorder kami ng bún bò Huế, beef noodle soup na parehong first time naming tikman. Tahimik lang kami habang kumakain, sabay tingin at tawa kasi nag-struggle ako sa chopsticks at dumudulas ang noodles lol.

Pagbalik sa hostel, hindi pa kami nauubosan ng energy. Lumabas pa kami ulit, bar hopping naman. Doon mas naging personal yung usapan, she told me how she hustled just to fund her trip, her big dreams, the things that scared her, even stories about our past relationships. Ang saya kasi hindi siya nag-hold back, and for once, I felt like someone actually wanted to hear me too. Naglaro pa kami ng foosball, tag-team against other travelers, then one-on-one. Sa dami ng tao sa bar, pakiramdam ko kami lang yung naririnig ng isa’t isa.

Umuwi kami magkahawak-kamay. Walang kiss, walang anything alasjuicy, wag kang ano jan, HAHAHA. Pero masaya.

The next day, instead of sticking to separate plans, nag-decide kaming mag-stay pa together sa HCM. Nag-book kami ng private room and nag explore ulit ng city since 2PM pa naman ang check-in time. Museum ng Ho Chi Minh first, the air-conditioning felt like heaven after the heat outside. She kept leaning a bit closer while reading the plaques, and I realized I wanted to know everything about her. Next, Notre-Dame Cathedral, its redish pink bricks glowing under the morning sun. We took photos together, I also took candid photos of her on my phone. Then, the post office, huge vaulted ceilings, intricate designs. Sa bawat building, ang dami naming natutunan, pero mas gusto ko yung kwentuhan namin habang naglalakad sa paligid, holding hands across street crossings, laughing at tiny mistakes in pronunciation.

That night nag decide kami mag party ulit hehehe syempre hindi mawawala ang walwal lol, habang sumasayaw kami sa club, duon nangyari yung first kiss namin, first kiss ko din ito. Awkward, sloppy, but full of laughter, excitement, and that electric connection you only feel once in a lifetime.

The next few days, ganoon lang routine namin. Explore sa umaga, window shopping sa Bến Thành Market, café hopping, street foods, herbs, grilled meat, lemongrass, spices na ang lakas ng aroma. She laughed at me trying to figure out how to eat some local snacks, wala kasing toothpick yung snail nila kaya ang hirap kainin lol. Pagdating ng gabi, night market, neon lights, tawanan, ingay ng mga tao sa street at motorbikes. Hawak kamay habang naglalakad sa madaming tao sa Bùi Viện Walking Street. Hindi na kailangan ng maraming activities, sapat na yung presence ng isa’t isa. Honestly, it felt like time stopped. The city was ours. I was full of life.

Pero dumating din yung inevitable. Kailangan ko nang bumalik ng Pinas, siya naman may flight papuntang Da Nang, this flight was actually rebooked, hehe, kasi binago niya yung plans para mag-match sa schedule ko. Sabay kami sa airport, at hindi na napigilang maluha bago maghiwalay. Hinawakan niya kamay ko ng mahigpit, parang ayaw ko nang pakawalan. Niyakap ko siya ng mahigpit, hanggang sa parang gusto ko nang i-freeze yung oras.

Before we finally let go, we shared our last kiss, quick, awkward, sweet, and full of everything we hadn’t said over the past few days in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam.

Yung flight pabalik ng Manila, sobrang bigat. Kahit nasa bus na ako pauwi, naiiyak pa rin ako, hahaha!

It wasn’t just a travel fling. Hindi lang basta fleeting excitement or kilig. That was the time I felt the deepest connection with someone, sa pinaka-unexpected na place, at sa pinaka-unexpected na moment. There’s something different, almost magical, about meeting someone when you’re both strangers, away from everything familiar. I’ve only ever felt that kind of connection while traveling, when the world feels both vast and intimate at the same time.

Yes, there’s always a price to pay when separation comes. But the memories, they last.

PS:

To Nikki, I know you’ll never read this, but I actually let you win in foosball that night just to see you smile wider, hahaha! Sometimes, I still look at our selfies and remember those days as the happiest time of my life.",2,1768626954.0,CasualPH,0,1.0,False

It has felt life-changing, calming, like I could relax and focus on doing 1 thing well instead of doing 100 things badly... but then I started getting really tired around 3-4pm and was napping.

And I personally hate that idea, because Wednesday like she said back in S1 isn't her mother, while they have similarities within their relationships, it shouldn't be a carbon copy of each other.

I picture Weyler as the type of couple where if they were out in public or say an event of some sort.

The other guest at the party wouldn't have a clue they were married until one of them brought it up because they act just like acquaintances/good friends at best, not affectionate at all.

Like for instance, I have a head canon that Wednesday will end up being a detective later in life, and Tyler will run a bakery or something.

I just picture a scene where Wednesday has a partner with her, maybe even a rookie police officer and they stop by the bakery because Wednesday wants coffee, but she never tells her partner that her husband owns the place.

So Wednesday and her partner are at the bakery enjoying their coffee/pastries or whatever.

And Wednesday and her partner are discussing a particularly tricky case.

And here comes Tyler wiping off the counters in front of them.

And all of a sudden Tyler says something smart, and Wednesday and Tyler start bouncing ideas off of each other.

And Wednesday partner is just shocked that Wednesday Addams has such a rapport with the Bakery owner.

And says something like, ""Wow, you two work really well together.""

1qf4esy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1qf4esy/some_advice_if_anyone_is_interested/,Some advice if anyone is interested,"Hi all,

I'm not promising that you will all have a good outcome here. But I just wanted to write a post because I am seeing an uptick in death by alcohol posts. This is pretty concerning. I have alcoholism in my family. Each person has their own level of being either high functioning or full blown where intervention was needed. I have seen people recover and I have seen people overdose or drive into a tree and stuff... so I get it.

I'm sorry to those that are suffering and that have lost their loved ones as if the disease itself isn't bad enough. Anyway, my spouse just recovered (well almost, he still has minor withdrawal symptoms) and I was the one that re-habbed him at home, cold turkey, the whole nine yards. I didn't expect him to return to us and he's still pretty difficult to live with but he's a person again. He currently is suffering from self hatred and anxiety but he's sober.

Here's what I want to say, I don't know if this will help anyone. Well, consider having your children stay with relatives or with friends for this, maybe on and off for a few months while you do this. What you can try is to be with your spouse and make attempts to reach them. Try to figure out if you can why the person is drinking, what is going on in their life or has occurred that might be making them feel so wretched about themself. Maybe even the two of you might be at a breaking point in your marriage and the person is coping by drinking. So start there. 

What I did first was to take care of myself, take a hard look at me and to get a little counseling. I had to get to a very calm place so that I could then do what I did next. This probably goes against all conventional advice but I literally threw myself into the fire. I previously worked with children with behavioral issues and have some basic training dealing with that. So you could even go online and take a short course on psych and/or on addiction, this will help you separate yourself and see that the person has been overtaken by this huge thing, this ""disease"". Once the person gets deep enough into drinking and using they lose the ability to stop, sometimes at this point (in my opinion) they simply can't. You've got to ride it out with them so that they hit their own rock bottom. Before I tell you what i did when i threw myself in to that fire. The devil will then come to visit you because of the alcohol's effect but this is when you want to try and reach them, ignore the abusive speech and try to imagine that you are speaking to a demon and not your spouse and keep them safe and keep yourself safe. If they do manage to stop or taper off this does end but it takes awhile and it is caused by the alcohol's effect on the brain. I will tell you this:

Please step away for awhile, please let them leave the house, get piss ass drunk and get lost and get messed up because if you don't they will never feel that feeling of humiliation and intense loneliness that can help to sometimes bring them back, sometimes this can help to get them sober. you also have to let go of being viewed as perfect or viewed a certain way during this time, don't hide, or isolate. Please tell loved ones and friends about what is going on and ask for space. Let go of that shame and just get your head in the game and start supporting the person who is suffering. How do you do that, and why the hell would anyone do so?

Well, my rationale was that I was protecting my community from an overly dramatic, loud and dysfunctional drunk-tard and keeping others safe by making sure my spouse was home and not out being disruptive. I think for this you have to first establish a routine where you and your spouse have meals together and you begin to set boundaries and routines where you say, if you can't meet this standard then this is the consequence. It's tough and it's complicated. Not everybody gets out of this. But having structure in the home can help long term.

So when i went into the fire, I realized that my spouse was suffering so deeply and he was so so upset with himself, and things going on in his life and he couldn't face those things. He wasn't communicating with me and he was in some severe denial. The process for getting my spouse back took several years. I will warn you. We moved twice during that time. And we had experienced job loss and financial hardship. My spouse also decided to take his retirement accounts and empty them...he made poor decisions so my advice is to get a separate bank account while they are lost and to protect your assets. Set this up immediately. Don't let them have too much control over finances during this time. 

I dove in headfirst and here's what I did once I realized what was going on. He refused help at all if not most stages. I made sure that he always had something to eat if he was going to drink, he was not allowed to drive and he was not allowed to walk around alone. I made sure to keep tabs on him and I also made it clear that I was not participating in the chaos. I did not want to go out to a bar with him but I would offer a ride, call me any time no matter how late it is. I was not happy with this but it kept things from becoming far worse and he was usually back home at the latest 2. On bad days he was back by 3 or 4 am. I made sure he knew he was loved but i also made it clear that the behavior was not ok so he had to sleep alone and stay away from me the next day, as he would then become anxious and moody. I would get him started with coffee so that he could have the energy to get up and get food. But I was not a catering service and he had to take care of himself. When he could not I helped but you will get tired and you will feel angry. Do this for a time but then tell them it's up to them.

I made sure he had 3 meals a day and I was strong about eating protein and not just junk. I treated him like a 5 year old because he was acting like one. In the beginning it was very bad and he wound up becoming slightly deluded with the addiction. His mind went somewhere else and we thought he might have bipolar or a shizo illness. I also did not know and was not aware of how heavily he was drinking or that he was drinking during the day at that time... we got him into a better routine by the grace of god and how i did that was i used work and online courses that he was supposed to do because he wasn't allowed to just sleep on the couch... he did sleep on the couch for about a year and at times i left and came back. he did get on the computer but he slept often and was a mess. It was horrible. I thought he would never get off that damn couch.

But at one point I realized that if something was going to change that I would have to do something different. I started to realize that he was in deep pain and that he needed support. Now some of the advice is not to do things for them, don't be co-dependent. So I tried to be there without getting into that too much. I worked to gain his trust by caring for him and when he was out of his mind, I was there for him. He would be shitfaced and really not in a good place and I didn't shy away from that. I talked him down, I got people involved and we all worked on him. We listened to his crazy rants and we were there with him. This is the key. You will hate doing this and you will say why TF should I go near that. This is how you can reach them, show them you aren't afraid, listen, give coffee and food and water and then get them to go take a nap or to go to sleep. Try to get them to a calmer place. Let them be a mess for awhile but then enforce your boundaries.

Lastly, when he finally stopped being deluded. I had now picked him up from the hospital a few times but I did that, I then made it my goal to support him but I was tough about him needing to get sober. I said if this doesn't change I am prepared to do what is needed which might be leave you and divorce. People told him he was going to lose me and I made sure he knew how good he had it by cooking good meals and taking care of myself and finding hobbies and things that i enjoyed more. I separated myself and he felt that. We were close before he got bad and that is also key, if you guys have a good foundation and a good bond, that helps so much. Again, feeling these things, like feeling me literally separate myself emotionally and close that door for awhile helps them to hear you silently and drives the point home. 

I then was ready to walk away, I went and got a court order and they said it might help wake him up. He couldn't stop on his own, so we took him in front of a judge and I was about to press charges...Guys, My whole family came and I wasn't afraid of how messed up this looked. People were so supportive at this point too. I went full law and wasn't afraid anymore. We then got an advocate and got some support where they worked with us and we had people we could call instead of police if he messed up...finally, I called police on him when he was at this local deli and drinking and I said if he walks home in the dark, he will most likely fall and could get hit by a car. He had fallen the last time he walked home and he hurt himself. I also watched for safety... I actually broke the order because he wasn't allowed in the house with alcohol and I told the cops that he shouldn't walk back home alone so i broke the order to pick him up and so they then stepped in and took him to a hospital that night. I bet riding in the cop car also made an impression.

You can't always do all of this and I caught it before it became worse so this may not work for everyone but do try to love them through it but also be tough and set boundaries. Take care of yourself which is most important. And be prepared for abusive behavior and come up with a plan for what you will do if he or she becomes unsafe. 

The last piece was I let him go to hell by himself, He went out to drink and I used to go after him but this time I let him go and he stayed out very late, he got sick and was throwing up and he finally asked for help. He couldn't do that before, he found a cop and said i don't know if I have a place to stay because my wife is trying to kick me out and I need help... they brought him to the hospital and they did a workup so we had proof of how much alcohol he had in his system. Then he started to slow down with drinking, each time he wanted to use drinking to cope I intervened and eventually he was able to go out without drinking. That was a miracle. He still drinks a little here and there, but stops now. And I know in the future he could start again but he knows I will walk out at that point and he knows where the line is. He also had to learn to trust me and himself.

Try to keep them at home instead of kicking them out and try to get an intervention done. You can leave for awhile but maybe keep them at home and give yourself a time period of how long you will allow them to remain there. Then tell them there is an expiration date. And everyone's situation is different. They shouldn't be by themselves because they will wander, can get hurt or will OD... and that is inevitable if they are alone. You should try to step in but if they are too far gone, either find support and help for that or sadly it might be too late. But do try. Try to get to them before they are drinking to kill themselves and are really at risk. We can't do this for everyone but that is what i would say. Try to get them sooner rather than later.

Also they should not be alone during withdrawal, they can die from high blood pressure or could commit suicide from the delirium tremens, their brains start acting up and they hear things or see things briefly...they will be punished for it so don't make it worse, trust me they are suffering already.

He was a legit person and we knew some people in common. We met for coffee a couple of times. We went for a walk around the park. We seemed into each other and were going to take it to the next level.

I don't like to sleep with someone until I'm sure its heading into a relationship but I was at the point that I was going to be open to that.  The next day was my birthday and we had plans to get together. We were looking forward to exploring the idea of intimacy. We both stopped using the dating site we met on and discussed that.

On the eve of my birthday we were texting a bit, but he was on the road, so I decided to say goodnight and get some sleep. I closed my door, layed down and dozed off. Some time later my bedroom door flew open so fast and loud it woke me up. The only other person in the house was on another level. No one was nearby and it really freaked me out. I was so scared my adrenaline had me wide awake instantly. To this day I have no explanation for such a strange scary thing.

Although scary, the outcome was good. While I was awake now suddenly in the middle of the night, some doubt crept in about the guy and I decided to check something. I logged onto the dating site and it showed he was currently online. This lead to me canceling our plans the next day. He tried to make some excuses or whatever but I no longer trusted him and ended things.

I later found out that he was still married and had affairs. A few years later I met someone he fooled and nearly destroyed. She was extremely beautiful, kind and intelligent. She had a Masters degree and was one of the smartest women I've ever met. I found out this man had devastated her mental health and was the worst thing that had ever happened to her. 

That could have been me, but I guess some unseen force slammed open my door to wake me from my blissful sleep and helped me dodge a bullet.",18,1768626705.0,Paranormal,3,1.0,False

I was really pissed at first, but then a terrible idea came to mind:

​I washed the beans like they were rice, dried them off with a paper towel, and then ground them like a heathen.

​Surprisingly, it still smells great! I can still smell the coffee clearly despite adding cinnamon. The taste is not bitter at all, granted, I always put a pinch of salt regardless of freshness, and hey, the brew is still dark. I was expecting it to be light brown or something, but it's still coffee.

​Now, I'm observing to see if the caffeine levels went down because of the washing. Usually, the first 3 sips gives me that boost to start the day, but I don't feel it right now. In terms of taste, either my palate just can't tell the difference, or maybe washing the beans doesn't affect flavor at all, which would be a great idea for the sake of sanitation, hahaha 😆☕.

​Also, if the caffeine does go down but the taste isn't affected, this might be a solution for those who have problems with caffeine but still love the taste of coffee.

​So, on a heresy scale of 1 to 10, where would this land? 

Probably wouldn't do this again, I love the smell of dry beans, when it was wet, it smelled stale to be honest which kinda made me worried at first, thankfully, most of the smell and taste are inside the beans.",3,1768625639.0,mokapot,4,1.0,False

The less my coworkers ""know"" me, the better.

Everything is peachy until two waitresses come back from a trip, and one of them is stunning. Like world stopping beautiful. 11/10.

Tell her about my grandparents and what they mean to me, tell her that if she needs anything, im here. Shes happy, like genuinely happy after hearing that.

Coworker explains what happened and that i went on a rant about the waitress and how i feel. Laugh it off and say that i mustve been talking about my ex. Coworker buys it.

PAGE THREE (6 PANELS)

PANEL 1

Interior. Expensive apartment, minimalist design. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city. KIAN REER sits at a broadcast desk. Professional lighting rig, multiple cameras, monitors displaying analytics. He's mid-stream, animated, passionate. 2.3M viewers shown on his monitor.

KIAN (streaming):

...and that's the POINT, chat. The system protects talent. Genius gets infinite chances while ordinary people...

PANEL 2

Close on Kian's face. Charismatic, intense, barely-contained anger. He's good at this. Every gesture practiced, every pause calculated.

KIAN:

...my parents didn't get a SINGLE chance. They got fifteen hours and a rigged trial-by-app. So when I say the Sympathy Index is the ONLY thing that can touch the untouchables...

PANEL 3

Kian's phone (on the desk, visible to camera) lights up with the nomination alert. He glances at it mid-sentence. His expression shifts. Not surprise, something else. Satisfaction? Vindication?

PHONE (notification):

SYMPATHY INDEX: NOMINATION ALERT

KIAN:

Hold on, chat. This is...

PANEL 4

Kian picks up his phone, studying the screen. His face unreadable now. The performance dropped for just a second. Whatever he sees confirms something he's been waiting for.

PANEL 5

Kian looks directly into camera. That charismatic mask back on, but underneath it, something darker. His viewers don't see it. They never do.

KIAN:

Chat. Tonight's nominations just dropped. And you're going to want to see this.

PANEL 6

Pull back to show Kian's streaming setup in context; walls covered in printed photos, red string connecting faces, documents. It looks like a conspiracy board. Because it is. At the center, we glimpse a photo of ZAYDEN ZATH.

KIAN:

Because finally, FINALLY, someone's being held accountable.

PAGE FOUR (6 PANELS)

PANEL 1

Interior. SympaTech headquarters. Sterile, modern, surveillance-state aesthetic. Glass walls, biometric scanners, CCTV everywhere. GRACELYI SAPPHIRE walks down a corridor in sharp business attire (tailored blazer, deep burgundy). Perfect posture. Her father's vintage watch visible on her wrist. She's checking her tablet.

GRACELYI (internal monologue):

Another day. Another compromise.

PANEL 2

Gracelyi enters the Security Operations Center; banks of screens showing surveillance feeds, data streams, the Sympathy Index interface. Other analysts work quietly. She takes her station, sets down her coffee (bergamot and cedar scent implied through art; steam rising elegantly).

COWORKER (off-panel):

Morning, Grace. Big day. Nominations just went live.

GRACELYI:

Always is.

PANEL 3

Gracelyi's screen displays the Sympathy Index interface; three nomination slots loading. Her expression is professionally neutral, but her hand unconsciously touches her father's watch. A tell. Something's different today.

SYSTEM (on-screen text):

LOADING NOMINATIONS...

VERIFICATION IN PROGRESS...

PANEL 4

Close on Gracelyi's face as the nominations resolve on her screen. We don't see what she sees; just the reflection of her monitors in her dark eyes. Her professional mask cracks. Just for a second.

GRACELYI:

No.

PANEL 5

Gracelyi's hand grips the edge of her desk. Knuckles white. The other hand still touching her father's watch. Around her, coworkers continue working, unaware. She's completely alone in a room full of people.

PANEL 6

KIAN: Still streaming, triumphant smile that doesn't reach his eyes

GRACELYI: At her desk, professional mask barely holding

CAPTION:

PANEL 2

Zayden's apartment. He's standing now, pacing. Running his hand through his hair (nervous tell). His mind is already working. Three monitors display different data streams. He's pulling up files, security protocols, network maps.

ZAYDEN:

Okay. Okay. Think. Who benefits from this? Who framed the NeuroSync breach? Who wants me silenced?

PANEL 3

Jules's garage. She's crouched beside Clutch, one hand on his head. The other holds her phone. She's not panicking, survivors don't panic. She's calculating.

JULES:

Maria Velez. 4th Street. You go to her if I don't come back, understand?

SFX (Clutch):

WHINE

PANEL 4

Kian's apartment. He's typing rapidly, setting up a new stream. His board of conspiracy evidence behind him. This is what he's been building toward. The culmination of three years of work.

KIAN (typing, speaking to camera):

Title: ""The Zayden Zath Question: Final Evidence."" Description: ""Tonight, talent privilege dies. Tonight, we prove the system works.""

PANEL 5

Gracelyi's office. She's opened a private encrypted terminal. Her fingers hover over the keyboard. Around her, the Security Operations Center continues its normal rhythm. Coworkers checking sympathy scores, monitoring voting patterns. She's about to do something that can't be undone.

GRACELYI (internal monologue):

Three years of cover. Three years of patience. And now this.

GRACELYI (internal monologue):

Zay, what did you do?

PANEL 6

I met him on tinder and we quickly moved to talking on Snapchat. After about a week of chatting, I asked him out skating and, although later I found out he had only been skating a couple of times before, but regardless he said yes and (when I found out) reassured me that he really wanted to go.

The day before the date I told him I was doing some Christmas shopping before hand and invited him along. He agreed an we spent about an hour just browsing the mall for last minute items. And then we went skating. We talked about family and school and just the regular basic stuff. We had a really good time.

After about an hour and a half I could see he was getting sore and asked if he’d like to leave and he agreed. I was prepared to bid him goodnight as it was around 8 pm but he said he didn’t want the date to end just yet and suggested a coffee shop nearby. We went and talked about anything and everything and nothing. 

At least 2 hours later and several, “well it’s getting late”s from both side that we finally decided to call it a night. We stood up, still talking and made our way outside and just stood there for a little while, talking some more and then there was a quiet spell where I looked at him and him at me. And he asked me for a kiss or if I would like to take it slower. I agreed and we kissed. I’ll spare you the details, but it was a good kiss and then we bid each other goodnight.

I got into my car and him into his. He text me almost immediately afterwards “I had so much fun, we should do it again. Text me when you get home.” I did, telling him next time we could do something other than skating. He said he didn’t mind skating w me again. (Which admittedly I liked quite a bit) We continued to text back and forth over the holidays a bit. He would only reply once or twice a day but I figured everyone is different texting wise and didn’t think anything of it. 

The new year came and his replies became a bit more stagnant but every reply was a paragraph of texts all at once talking about upcoming classes and him moving/finding a dorm and apologizing for his lack of communication. I let it go and ended up asking him out again. He agreed but said he was busy w moving and other things but would try to find time over the weekend for a quick coffee date or something. I agreed and said I understand but was content to do anything, even if it was just moving him into his dorm.

That was Thursday. He don’t text back all weekend. Tuesday I get a text “I’m so sorry. I’ve been sick and I haven’t moved and I’m already behind on things.” And some other apologies. I left it alone and replied a couple days later bc I didn’t want to be a bother and asked if he was moved in and settled into his dorm. No reply for 4 days. I sent him an update on my life and asked when the next time he was free. It’s been 4 days since then and he’s not so much as opened the messages. 

My gut says he’s probably not interested but it was one date so maybe I’m just romanticizing something into something it’s not? Thoughts? Advice?",2,1768625325.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1qf3wfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1qf3wfb/weird_symptom_need_help/,Weird symptom need help,"Hi, I've been struggling with a horrible symptom for years, and haven't had much luck with doctors, seeing if anyone else has experienced it, since people here turn to supplements to try to help with their health issues.

I get an inner pressure sensation - sort of like a bike tire that's overinflated and needs air out - that feels like it's in the majority of my cells/body. It often feels concentrated behind my eyes, but not always. It makes me want to crawl out of my skin. It's hard to focus on anything and I can't relax.

It first started years ago when I was put on a trial dose of Naturethroid for over a year. I got extremely ill and experienced this sensation for the first time, and severe nausea and anxiety. My tsh was normal on the dose but my free t3 and t4 were bottom of the range. I had constant tachycardia. I became disabled and had to stop working it got so bad. I had the sensation 24/7. My doctor attempted to optimize my t4 and t3 levels with medication and I was worse than ever, could barely walk, in severe discomfort.

I ended up switching to low dose levo and weaned off of it, and my numbers improved significantly after being off it. The sensation went away for months. I am back to working. I have NO hypothyroid symptoms and my free t4 and free t3 are optimal.

I have been tested for hashimotos and thyroid damage, I do not have either. I was found to have low ferritin, low iodine, low vit D, low b12.

I was taking the vitamins for a while, but the sensation started coming back on occasion, and I wasn't sure if they were contributing, so I took a break. My b12 is now great, but my ferritin is still low so I am taking some iron again.

I still get the sensation sometimes, but I can't figure out why. It's exhausting and giving me PTSD it's so bad and completely upends my life and ability to function. It gets paired with brain fog and no sex drive, although the drive part is probably low just because I am just so uncomfortable.

Almost every herbal adaptogen seems to trigger it, or make it worse. Not always immediately, it can be after a few days. My first theory was that the feeling is caused by my cortisol getting lowered too much or for too long.

But my cortisol tested normal, and I don't necessarily get severe weakness or low blood sugar as is typical with low cortisol.

Then my theory was that I was somehow going towards too high thyroid levels, but I don't feel jittery or have heart palps, feel hot, or really hungry. And my thyroid has never been tested as high/hyper while off medication.

So now I'm wondering if my cortisol surges high sometimes, because that would explain the inner discomfort and restless feeling. But my heart rate and blood pressure can be normal while feeling this way (heart rate sometimes goes high, 90-100). Also there have been times where my cortisol ""feels"" high (feel like a caged animal, higher blood sugar, puffy face, wired) but I don't have the particular feeling with those symptoms.

So then there's the theory of low thyroid - but I haven't heard of hypo people experiencing this. Usually they're sleepy, constipated, cold, low appetite, weight gain - I am not constipated at all (gut health is great), eat a normal amount, am a fit weight, don't get cold too easily, but not hot either.

Last time I had a blood test that was extensive, I wasn't experiencing this sensation. I have spent so much money on tests and supplements and feel like I'm going in circles and getting no where. My dhea was on the lower end, and that was about it. My immune health/white blood cell counts, blood sugar, were perfect.

One doctor suggested Lyme and I did a year of herbals with no improvement, and the herbs made the feeling worse with no ease over time.

Could progesterone issues cause this? (Am woman in late 20s).Something else entirely? It's so oddly severe and specific. It's not a headache.

One other weird thing I've noticed: I feel better after after getting blood drawn. I can't think of a single time I was having the sensation after a blood test.

Also weird: if I take an adaptogen and it makes the sensation worse, sometimes coffee helps temporarily.

But if I have caffeine on its own, sometimes it triggers the feeling.

I once tried higher dose iodine and although lower dose iodine did not help, higher dose iodine temporarily alleviated it. But I did not like how the high dose iodine made me feel (fatigued, blood sugar went lower) and was nervous about taking a higher dose for a longer period, so I did not continue.

Things that would seemingly help: magnesium, Benadryl, nsaids, cortisol lowering herbs, valerian, lavender, passionflower, do not touch on or improve the feeling.

Any ideas?

But never heard anything from her after asking her over text to go get coffee. I also unemployed and getting a new job is my priority, I wish I was drowning in work so this would be easier to shake. Unfortunately even going to the gym can’t help me shake it. I get matches on dating apps, but I never take them seriously because anytime I ask someone out I get ghosted there.

And if you boil the closed can, it becomes caramel, I heard Italians do this and call dulce de leche

# Beyond the Bean: Unlocking Exceptional Flavor in Beans of Coffee

There's a magical moment each morning: the quiet hiss of the grinder, the unfolding fragrance of freshly ground coffee, and that first, restorative sip. This daily ritual, for many, is the anchor of the day. But the true magic doesn’t start in your kitchen; it begins with the humble beans of coffee themselves, each one a promise of flavor, a testament to its origin.

At Intelligentsia, we understand that not all coffee beans are created equal. Unlike commodity brands, we've pioneered a different path: **Direct Trade**. It's a philosophy built on years-long, transparent relationships with growers at origin. We visit the farms, collaborate on best practices, and pay well above Fair Trade prices for truly elite quality beans. This ensures sustainable livelihoods and unparalleled flavor. From the vibrant notes of our seasonal Direct Trade Single Origins to the iconic, syrupy body of our Black Cat Espresso, every bean tells a story of meticulous care.

*   **Unmatched Freshness:** We roast your coffee only _after_ you order it. Our beans are never sitting on a shelf; they're roasted specifically for you and shipped immediately, ensuring peak aromatic potential and flavor clarity.
*   **Ethical Excellence, Not Just Good Enough:** Our Direct Trade model goes beyond industry standards, fostering deep partnerships that reward exceptional quality and sustainable practices directly at the source.
*   **Flavor Defined by Origin:** Experience the true character of each bean. Our expert roasting highlights the unique terroir and varietal nuances, from bright acidity to rich, complex sweetness, without compromise.

We have allowed for visitors but obviously with the short stay etiquette, the only exception to this rule is my mum and sisters as they help us out with housework, cooking, cleaning and watch baby while we rest.

My husbands family have invited themselves over and expect us to host a meal each time they come over. They show up empty handed, do not offer help with housework, walk into our house demanding coffees, overstay their welcome and I don’t trust them to watch the baby.

As first time parents, we have had a rough time particularly myself as I have PPD, PPA and have had a hard time with breastfeeding. I find my husbands family to be a bit inconsiderate and rude expecting us to host a meal for them when we just had a baby and we are on reduced wages due to parental leave, I would rather use that money on my son and not on them.

My family have come over for short stays, always show up with food for us so we don’t have to cook and clean the dishes and do the laundry before they go.

I have tried to explain to my husband how I find this rude and do not wish to host his family, he thinks I’m being a bit ridiculous as he doesn’t mind but I do. He thinks I feel this way because my family do the above and I expect that from his family too. We have been arguing about this for the last week.

1qf3hvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BelgianMalinois/comments/1qf3hvq/health_scare_sharing_in_case_it_helps_anyone/,"Health scare, sharing in case it helps anyone","My sister left a small piece of a raisin bagel on our coffee table and got distracted by my baby, who she was holding at the time. I was in the other room, and walked in as she walked out, and saw my mal chewing and swallowing something. Then I saw the other part of the bagel on the table and my heart sank. Called vet right away, they confirmed that even one raisin is an emergency (and with about 1/8 of a bagel it’s hard to know how many exactly). In case anyone doesn’t know, they cause kidney and other organ failure, and you don’t know how sensitive your dog is to one vs 100 until and unless it’s too late. Vet gave us two options: give him 1/4 cup hydrogen peroxide to induce vomiting at home, and hope that works and he vomits, or bring him to them — they induce vomiting and do blood panels to check organ function. I chose the first option especially since my vet is 40 min away. 

One of us held my mal’s jaws open while the other poured the peroxide in — he basically gagged it down and half of it spilled on the ground. We were trying to get him to come back to do another 1/8 cup but thankfully he started vomiting. I then had the enviable task of sifting through the vomit to search for the bagel. It was still basically intact and I counted about a dozen raisins then sent some pics off to the vet, who gave the stamp of approval. Mal was back in action within about 15 minutes 😊 he’s totally good now. So thankful that I happened to see him right after he’d eaten it, and that we had peroxide right there.

restaurants i tried:

union hill: $50 dinner, 9/10 especially as a group. not super cheap but their rw menu had something for everyone and everything we tried was amazing

strang hall: $20, 11/10 especially as a group. anousome is a stand out. love the yellow curry. happy hour nachos were great for $8

jinya ramen: $20, 7/10 they were out of both desserts and theyre a chain but theyre probably the best food/$ ratio

restaurants i didnt try but piqued my interest:

homegrown kitchen: $20 for pastry, coffee, and literally any entree from their menu

minskey’s pizza: very cheap! personally i would only eat minskeys if it was free but if you enjoy their pizza give them a visit

tall trellis brew co.: crazy good deal

beer kitchen: solid menu for $20 but im biased because i would pay $20 alone for their chicken thigh fries

1889 pizza napoletana: $65 dinner for two?

amigos grill and cantina: $20 for chips/dip, an entree, AND a house marg?? huge if real

t’aha mexican kitchen: i appreciate that these deals have specialty drinks built in!
