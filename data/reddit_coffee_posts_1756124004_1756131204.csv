1mzrjal,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1mzrjal/being_held_prisoner_at_fd/,Being held prisoner at FD,"This is going to be a VERY long post. I know I will get snide comments about being able to shorten it up but what is the fun of that? I actually enjoy reading long posts from my fellow FD workers. So if you don't like reading long posts you can mosey on. 

 As NA I am held prisoner at the FD until my relief arrives at 7am. As most of us know FD agents do not know the meaning of teamwork. If you have any at your location who do know the meaning you are extremely lucky. 

I have ADHD along with anxiety and usually work shifts by myself.

 Almost 500 rooms, casino hotel, answering phones after midnight, checking in and doing audit, plus numerous other side work. I definitely need to be medicated to handle all of the multitasking that I have to do. 

Due to my relief not showing up I missed my appointment and they refused to re-fill my prescription until I see him.  So I have been out of meds for a week. Surprisingly I was doing well without it until Saturday night and then I guess the weeks ""issues"" just got to me. Not only that, I have been at my max PTO for two months and have not been able to take any time off until now. Just two days along with my regular 2 days off but damn I'm exhausted so I'm looking forward to some good rest. 

Managers have to send a pass-on log to other managers before leaving. I was feeling kind of smart alecly and needed to vent so this is what I attached to my pass-on log:

I am mainly writing this as it helps when I am thoroughly aggravated but I thought...why not send it out and give someone a laugh and some sense of what we have to go through at the FD, so here is my tale of woe:

Thursday night (alone) - the fun started almost as soon as I walked in the door. I am dealing with the remaining arrivals showing up, trying to get my pre-audit done, answering forty eleven hundred phone calls AND dealing with the very annoying forty eleven hundred distractions of ""Where is such and such restaurant"", ""Where is the bathroom"", Where did I leave my brain"" that we get constantly because security in their infinite wisdom is stationed around the corner instead of the escalator/elevator entrance where guests arrive. 

During all of this ""fun"" the printer decides it wants to start acting up and eating all of my papers. 
So, I think, ok, this aggravating but I will use the other one. Of course...the other one is running out of ink...and  no ink to replace it. Lovely. My night is better better and better. 

It FINALLY starts to settle down around 3:30am so I decide to slip down to the dungeon and get a couple of boxes of key cards. I grab the MOD phone (manager on duty) and slip it into my front pocket (important for story) and head to the dungeon (what we call the supply room in the bowels of the casino). 

If anyone reading this is familiar  with the dungeon where we have all our supplies than you know just how crammed it is. So, I squeeze in between some pallets and grab one of the very heavy boxes and turn to place it on the dolly not realizing my foot has become entangled in one of the straps that go around the pallets, so I fall into another pallet, and my shoe goes flying in the air. Seeing as I have already had a crappy night I hollered out ""this place is a fucking deathtrap!"". All of a sudden a voice says, ""I'm sorry, I don't understand that request"". 

I have to say, I laughed so damn hard I was actually in a better mood the rest of my shift. 

Friday night was amazing, I should have known I could not possibly have two of those in a row. 

Saturday night (alone, concert night) - Slammed. 1/3 of the hotel guests decide after midnight is the perfect time to start calling for towels, blankets, toilet paper, etc. 

Then I start getting a lot guests coming to the desk stating their keys are not working. The light is turning green but it just will not open. I tell the guests if the light is turning green everything is fine, they just need to lift the handle up instead of down.  They argue and insist they are doing this. So maintenance is running all over to help with the locks and guess what? They use the guests key, insert it in the lock and lift the handle up. Voila! Door opens. Intoxication...gotta love it. 

Of course, AGAIN, I am dealing with forty eleven hundred distractions from the phones and guests ""stopping"" by the desk for directions as I am trying to get Everything together for my audit (a lot involved on the weekends). 

I received  a call from a gentleman who tells me he just can't sleep due to the music that plays outside and inside. Now, dear readers, I must tell you,  if I knowingly mess up I will rat myself out, I have no problem telling on myself. Having said that I told them gentleman, ""yeeeah, maybe for future reference if you want peace and quiet you should not book somewhere that says ""Soft Rock"". 

Then I get a lady at the desk that states "" I guess I put my key next to something  electronic and it zapped it so my door won't open"".  I re-keyed it, handed it to her and she  actually had the nerve to ask me ""so what kind of compensation are you giving me for this?"". I said ""fooor?"". She states ""for me having to walk back down here"". Honestly, all I could do was laugh as I said, ""sorry, you zapping your own card does not constitute compensation for you,  have a good night though"". 

And then to top off my night I run to the employee lounge to re-fill my coffee mug, pull the top off and what the hell?! An ink pen is in my cup. Now how the HELL did that get in there?!

So, I hope you enjoyed my little tale, I will soon be getting off for 4 MUCH needed days. And God willing when I come back I'll have my meds! 

The end of my pass on. I know other FD agents can totally relate to this. Sure hoping I re-charge before I go back. Have a wonderful day/night all! ",1,1756131010.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,0,1.0,False

1mzrh71,https://i.redd.it/ogsmlegl86lf1.png,[Rum Review #172] Cubaney 21,"What I've learned about this rum is that it's made by Oliver & Oliver in the Dominican Republic. In my experience and limited knowledge, I've discovered that the two major rum companies in the Dominican Republic are Barcel√≥ and Brugal, while the main secondary rum companies are Oliver & Oliver and Dupuy (which is already closed). However, on this last visit to the island, I noticed a large quantity and variety of Oliver & Oliver rums, so it seems they are increasing their production/variety.

There's very little information about this Cubaney 21 on Oliver & Oliver's own website. This rum doesn't appear... well, there are many that don't, as they've only featured their highest-quality rums, so this one can't possibly be one. However, the bottle emphasizes that it's a solera product, so the 21 can't be anything more than decorative.

Made by: Oliver & Oliver  
Name of the rum: 21 Gran Reserva XO  
Brand: Cubaney  
Origin: Dominican Republic  
Age: Solera, 21 years (according to the brand)

**Nose:** Not the most typical of Dominican rum... or rather, the greater intensity is in aromas that are not the typical ones, such as apples, caramel, floral notes, synthetic peach, oak, and chocolate.

**Palate:** The palate highlights flavors of oak, caramel, creamy coffee, vanilla, green apple and salt.

**Retrohale/Finish:** Red apple, grape and lemon zest.

**Rating:** 7 on the t8ke

**Conclusion:** I was pleasantly surprised by this Cubaney 21, perhaps in part because I wasn't expecting much from it, and it has distinct flavors. The whole solera and age statement really threw me off and I was thinking this would be another iteration of the endless solera drivel. And while I think it would be better for it to just throw out the whole age statement, it was very surprising, if a bit sweet for me. 



English is not my first language and most of my reviews have been posted originally in Spanish, and later translated into English, so I apologize if they sometimes sound *mechanical*. On reddit I'm aiming to review mostly Venezuelan rums, but I post a bit of everything. You can check out the rest of my reviews (in Spanish) on [my blog](https://humoytabaco.com/), including rum, whisk(e)y, agave, gin and cigars. I also have an Instagram account [in Spanish](https://www.instagram.com/robleytabaco/) as well and another one [in English](https://www.instagram.com/oaknsmokes/), where I'll regularly update video reviews.

Page 0: Prologue - The Unraveling 

Before the Labyrinth, before the Fields, the All existed. A universe of constant laws, predictable skies and a humanity that, in its arrogant innocence, believed it was the owner of its destiny.

The event that annihilated that reality was not a conventional cataclysm. There were no nuclear explosions, no asteroid impacts, no roar of a final war. It was a phenomenon of such a profoundly unnatural nature that the human mind still struggles to conceptualize it. The old digital archives, those that can still be deciphered in the rarest Lots, call it ""The Unraveling"".

It was the sound of the universe being torn apart at a specific point in its fabric. An instantaneous, absolute and global silence that swallowed every scream, every whisper, every heartbeat. Between the years that records identify as 2000 and 2002, every human being on Earth, without apparent exception, disappeared without leaving the slightest physical trace. The cities, the cars on the highways, the steaming cups of coffee on office tables, the toys on playgrounds, everything remained intact. The world remained empty, perfectly preserved and terribly silent.

But humanity was not annihilated. There was no such privilege.

In the cosmic blink that marked our disappearance, we were torn away. Torn from the roots of our cosmic home and scattered, adrift and totally vulnerable, in the bosom of a new and terrible paradise: Dimension 64.

This place, this kingdom or this prison, does not obey the laws of physics or logic that we once took for granted. It is an infinite and broken puzzle, a geological and dimensional nightmare composed of a hierarchy of inconceivable scale: 10 immeasurable Fields, each divided into 64 overlapping Layers, and each Layer hosting up to ten Biomes, worlds in themselves as vast as continents and as alien as nightmares.

Was the Unraveling an accident? The collateral effect of a failed experiment at the dawn of artificial intelligence, the Y2K that we feared so much but whose true nature we never understood? Or was it deliberate? The action of a conscious and unimaginable force, weaving and unweaving realities at will?

Legends whispered in fortified shelters speak of structures older than humanity itself in this dimension: ruined cities of impossible geometry, planet-sized gears turning in the darkness. Who built them? Are they the architects of this prison or simply its former tenants, as lost as we are? Ourselves?

There are no answers. Only the echo of the silence that brought us here and the constant hum of the Biomes, a reminder that the universe we knew has faded, and that our fight is not to return to it, but to not be completely erased from this terrible new order.

This is the chronicle of the Newcomers. This is the story of those who survived the Great Void. This is the legend of Dimension 64.

Clear. Here is a proposal for the first page of the book, establishing the tone, the character and the initial mystery.


 Page 1: The Echo of Silence 

The last sound of my old life was not the roar of an explosion, nor the scream of a terrified crowd. It was the dull *thump, thump, thump* of bass music that crossed the floor of the apartment, mixed with the raucous laughter of someone I no longer remember. It smelled like spilled beer and cheap perfume. He was leaning on the balcony railing, looking at the lights of the city that we thought was eternal, feeling the cold of the metal through his shirt. Derek must have been in the kitchen, looking for more ice. Marco had arrived half an hour ago with a smile from ear to ear. Sara...hadn't come.

I rested my forehead on the cold glass of the window. A dull throb of pain, the prelude to a hangover that would never come, was beginning to announce itself behind my eyes.

And then, the void.

It wasn't a sound. It was the *absence* of all sounds at once. A silence so absolute, so violent, that it felt like a blow to the eardrum. The music faded away. The laughter, the screams, the distant sound of traffic... everything, erased.

I turned, reeling from the sudden change. The party was still there. The bottles in a row on the table. The plastic bowl with the remains of some nachos. The flickering light of a lava lamp. But there was no one. Where a moment ago there were a dozen people squashed in the living room, now there was only empty space and a couple of glasses swinging in the air, as if someone had knocked them down a second before.

‚ÄúDerek?‚Äù My voice was obscenely loud, a raspy whisper that drowned out on the carpet. There was no response. ""Frame!""

I ran around the apartment. Empty. The kitchen, empty. The bathroom, empty. The apartment next door, whose door was open‚Ä¶ empty. A cold terror, completely foreign to the fear I knew, began to crawl up my spine. I stuck my head out of the balcony.

The highway was a frozen snake of steel and glass. There was no movement. There was no sound. Not even wind. The city lights shone, indifferently, on a world that had been evicted.

That's when I saw him. Or, rather, when I stopped seeing him. The horizon‚Ä¶was fading. Not like in a fog, but like someone was erasing reality with a gigantic eraser. A great grayish void advanced, silent, swallowing the buildings one after another, approaching me.

I stepped back inside, my heart hammering in my chest. There was nowhere to run. Nothingness surrounded everything. The apartment window was now a portal to absence. The void crossed the threshold.

There was no pain. Just a feeling of infinite vertigo, of being torn apart, of being a musical note torn from a score and thrown into chaos.

And then, the smell.

The first sense to return was smell. A sour smell of ozone, rusty metal and wet concrete. A smell that had never existed on Earth.

I opened my eyes. He was no longer in the apartment. He lay on a cold, damp surface, in perpetual darkness. I sat up, every muscle protesting, and leaned against a rough brick wall. I looked up, searching for the stars, the moon, anything familiar.

Where the sky should have been, the bases of bridges and inverted skyscrapers arched monstrously, forming a grotesque cage above a sickly purple sky. Neon lights in languages ‚Äã‚ÄãI couldn't understand flickered in the distance, illuminating canyons of impossible architecture.

 Page 2 

The void did not find Derek on the balcony, contemplating the transience of things. He found it in the heart of the party, in the most crowded and noisy place in the apartment: opening the refrigerator in the kitchen.

His hand closed his fingers around the cold neck of a beer bottle. The foam inside another one that someone had waved around as a stupid joke exploded with a wet *pffft*, soaking his shirt. A group laugh broke out behind them. He turned around, feigning anger, with a smile that didn't reach his eyes. He looked for John in the crowd, thinking about dragging him to the terrace to escape the bustle.

That's when the bottle he had just shaken slipped from his hand.

It didn't crash to the ground.

It remained suspended in the air, halfway between his fingers and the tiles, a golden stream of frozen liquid in a perfect, motionless arc. The laughter that filled the room stopped dead. It didn't go out, it didn't go extinct. It was *deleted*. The silence that replaced her was so thick and heavy that her ears hurt.

Derek blinked, confused. The people‚Ä¶had disappeared. The kitchen was cluttered with evidence of his existence‚Äîhalf-finished glasses, a cell phone forgotten on the counter with the screen still on‚Äîbut there was not a soul. Just him and the bottle defiantly suspended in the laws of a physics that no longer worked.

‚ÄúJohn?‚Äù His voice sounded like a gunshot in an empty cathedral. ""Hey, this isn't funny! Where have you all been?""

Nothing. A cold sweat, very different from the heat of the party, ran down the back of his neck. He walked clumsily toward the living room, avoiding the floating bottle. The emptiness was absolute. Through the living room window, the city was an illuminated and silent diorama. Not a car, not a siren, not a single moving light.

And then the window stopped showing the city. It began to show‚Ä¶ nothing. A flat, infinite and hungry gray that ate the urban landscape and began to devour the adjacent buildings, approaching him.

Derek's instinct, always visceral, was not to freeze or scream. It was **run away**. He ran toward the apartment's front door, his steps muffled by the grotesquely silent carpet. He turned the doorknob.

The door did not open to a stair landing. It opened to the same gray, implacable nothingness that filled the window. There was no hallway. There was no building. There was no world.

There was no time for panic. Nothingness enveloped him with the softness of a shroud. He felt a fall that was not a fall, a tear that tore not his body, but his place in the universe.

And he landed with a dry, painful gasp on a surface of cold, undulating metal. An overwhelming smell of burning oil, brine, and rust filled his nostrils. The sound that welcomed him was not silence, but the distant and constant rumble of heavy machinery, the screeching of protesting iron and a non-human scream that was lost in the immensity.

Derek sat up, panting, in the darkness of a place that had nothing to do with the warm, stupid party just a minute before. He was alone, terrified, and completely lost in the echoing darkness of the Steam Hive.


 Page 3 

The void did not find Sara at the party. He found her three streets away, walking with a quick and determined step under the dim light of the streetlights. I was late. He had had to work and a pang of social anxiety had caused him to delay leaving. He carried a bottle of cheap wine in one hand, like a talisman of good will, and with the other he adjusted his jacket against the cold night wind.

The sound of his life was not music, but the *clack, clack, clack* of his boots on the sidewalk and the distant hum of the city. He passed a laughing couple, a man talking vehemently on the phone, a group of friends leaving a bar. Life, normal and bustling.

He stopped at the red light on the street he had to cross to get to John's building. He looked at his distorted reflection in the dark window of a clothing store. He mentally fixed a wayward fuse.

The traffic light changed to green. He took his first step onto the road.

And then the world faded away.

It wasn't a sound that went away. It was *life*. The *clack* of his boot had no echo. The hum of the city disappeared, absorbed by a layer of infinite cotton. The murmur of the people, the engines of the cars, everything... was gone.

She stood petrified in the middle of the zebra crossing, with one foot still on the sidewalk. The laughing couple had disappeared. The man on the phone, evaporated. The group of friends, deleted. The cars waiting at the traffic lights were there, with their lights on and their engines... off? No, it was worse: it was as if the engines, the sound, the very essence of everything, had never existed.

""Sara"" did not shout. He held his breath, his eyes, large and alert, scanning the deserted street. It was a stillness so profound that he could hear the blood pounding in his ears. It was the most terrifying silence I could imagine.

He looked up, instinctively searching the sky for an explanation. But the sky was no longer there. A blur of grayish nothingness spread across the sky, erasing the stars, devouring the outlines of the skyscrapers. It advanced inexorably, a blackout of reality.

Terror, cold and sharp, nailed his feet to the asphalt. There was nowhere to run. Nothingness enveloped everything, approaching from both ends of the street, from above. It was a perfect trap.

The last thing she saw before the gray touched her was the green light of the traffic light, flashing absurdly over a world that had stopped working.

There was no fall. There was a‚Ä¶ transfer. A sensation of being torn off and projected through an infinite narrowness.

He landed on his knees on a soft, wet surface. A smell of wet earth, decaying vegetation, and rotting flowers filled her. The sound of silence was replaced by a cacophony of clicking sounds, alien hums, and the rustling of branches in the distance. The light was green, dim, filtered by a canopy of leaves and vines as thick as their arms, blocking any view of the sky.

She stood up, trembling, in the vibrant darkness of the Infinite Jungle. I was completely alone. The wine bottle lay broken at his feet, its contents staining the strange undergrowth an obscene and familiar purple.


 Page 4 

The void did not find Marco drinking or laughing. She found him in the bathroom of the apartment, with his back against the closed door, his lips lost on the neck of a girl whose name he no longer remembered. The air was hot, heavy with the steam of the recently used shower and the sweet aroma of her perfume mixed with alcohol.

She laughed, a muffled sound close against his skin, as her fingers tangled in his hair. The music was a dull and distant beat, the perfect soundtrack for the moment. Marco smiled against her skin, feeling the familiar vertigo of the night, the promise of an end without consequences. It was all heat, noise, and the clumsy haste of two strangers.

He was the first to notice it.

The bass of the music, that constant beat that made the ground vibrate, faded away. It didn't go down in volume. It *cut*. As if someone had disconnected the universe's speakers.

The girl pulled back an inch, her eyes blurred between desire and confusion. ""Did the power go out?"" he murmured, his voice unnaturally loud in the new silence.

Marco didn't respond. Heard. There was nothing. No music, no laughter, no murmur of dozens of conversations on the other side of the door. Just a ghostly ringing in his ears and the sound of his own breathing, which suddenly seemed obscenely loud.

""Marco, what's wrong?"" Her voice sounded shaky, tinged with a concern that was instantly contagious.

He backed away completely and turned the doorknob. He opened it just a couple of centimeters, enough to spy the hallway and the living room beyond.

Empty.

Not empty as in ""people went to another room."" Empty as in ""there was never anyone here."" Glasses half full, jackets abandoned on chairs, a phone vibrating silently on a table. But not a soul.

""It's a joke?"" the girl asked, peeking over his shoulder. His face paled. ""My God...""

Marco pushed the door open and stepped out into the hallway. ""Hey! John? Derek!"" His scream was drowned in the carpet, without echo. He ran toward the balcony, the girl close at his heels. What he saw took his breath away.

The city was still. Silent. The lights were on, but it was a ghost town. And the horizon... the horizon was a blur of nothing, a gray wall that ate up the buildings, approaching them at an impossible speed.

""What's that?"" the girl whimpered, clinging to his arm with a panicked grip.

There was no time for a response. Nothingness crossed the threshold of the balcony. Marco felt the instinct to grab her, to protect himself, to protect her, but there was nothing to grab. The sensation was not one of impact, but of dissolution. How to be broken down into pixels.

And then, the reformulation.

He landed with a sharp, painful thump on a cold, metallic surface. A foul smell of organic rot and rancid oil hit him. A piercing, inhuman scream echoed in the distance, followed by a wet crunch.

I was alone. Lying on a rusty walkway that hung over impenetrable blackness. There was no sign of the girl. There was no sign of the party. Only the echoing darkness and malaise hum of the Steam Hive. Marco sat up, gasping, his heart pounding in his chest with a rhythm of pure terror. The night of passion had turned into a nightmare of absolute loneliness.


 Page 5 

The void did not find Mewy at a party, nor on a street, nor in a bathroom. He found him in the safest and warmest place he knew: sleeping curled up on the couch at home, on a soft wool blanket, with the soft sound of the television on in the background.

It was a cat. An orange cat with faint stripes and white paws. His world was simple and perfect. It smelled like the tuna dinner he had had hours before and the familiar perfume of his human, Sara, who had left a while ago, promising to return soon with her soft voice.

I was dreaming about chasing a laser light down an endless hallway when the sound on the TV went off.

It was not a normal blackout. It was an instantaneous, absolute silence that even his feline dream registered as deeply wrong. The electrical hum of the house, the ticking of the kitchen clock, the distant motor of the refrigerator... everything disappeared.

Mewy opened his eyes, slowly, pupils dilated in the dimness. He sat up, arching his back in a gesture of concern. The atmosphere was charged, heavy. Something was very wrong.

‚ÄúMeow?‚Äù His meow, normally barely a whisper, sounded thunderous in the dead silence.

There was no response. There was no hum of the heating, nor the footsteps of the neighbors upstairs. Nothing.

He jumped off the couch with his usual feline agility, but landed cautiously, each of his senses on high alert. Ears swiveled like radars, picking up‚Ä¶ nothing. Absolutely nothing. The house was empty of sounds, but also of‚Ä¶ presence. The comforting essence of his human had completely faded.

He walked through the rooms, his tail bristled. The bed was made, Sara's computer was off, her favorite cup of tea was cold on the table. Everything in its place, but everything dead. All hollow.

He stuck his nose through the crack in the window. The street was the same. Cars stopped, lights on, but no movement. Lifeless. It was like someone had pressed the pause button on the world, but only for everything that had a soul.

A primal fear, which he did not understand but which he felt in every hair on his back, took hold of him. He cowered behind the couch, seeking refuge in the darkness.

That's when he saw her. The nothingness. A gray and silent wall that advanced down the street, swallowing the cars, the streetlights, the buildings. It didn't make noise. It only expanded, indifferent and horrible.

Mewy gave a low, instinctive, useless snort. Nothingness crossed the window.

He didn't feel pain. He felt extreme coldness and a sensation of vertigo, of being sucked in. Then, an unbearable pressure, as if he were being put into a box that was too small for him.

And suddenly, the pressure stopped.

He landed softly on something cold and metallic. An overwhelming smell of ozone, oil, and something metallic and salty filled his nose. Strange noises, distant squeaks and rumbles, hit his sensitive ears.

He found himself on a narrow ledge, in the shadows of a cavernous and gigantic place. He looked at his paws. He was still a cat. But something in his mind‚Ä¶ had changed. The feline simplicity was clouded with a wave of complex and terrifying understanding. He understood the loneliness, the danger, the monstrous scale of his new surroundings.

And he understood that he had to survive.

His gaze fell on a nearby object, abandoned in a corner of the shelf: a rusty but sharp kitchen knife. With a determination he didn't know he possessed, he approached, sniffed it, and with a clumsy but determined movement, pushed it until he managed to hook the handle between his jaws.

It was heavy and uncomfortable, but it was something. Mewy the orange cat now stood in the gloom of the Steam Hive, armed and alone, a newfound intelligence burning in his green eyes. His human had disappeared. Now, he was his own protection.


 Page 6 

The void did not find Lucas‚Äîthe name Void had once had‚Äîin a place with people. He found him alone, as always. Sitting on the edge of his bed, in his small apartment, staring at the black screen of his computer. The room was dim, illuminated only by the cold moonlight filtering through the window. There were no parties for him, no friends waiting for him. Just the quiet anxiety of a life that felt like it didn't fit anywhere, and the paralyzing pressure of not knowing what to do with it.

His fingers drummed on his knees, a nervous, melodyless rhythm. Should I send that resume? Call someone? Go for a walk aimlessly? Each option seemed equally exhausting, equally meaningless. He felt trapped in a loop of his own creation, a rotten loop of indecision and hopelessness.

He looked out the window. The city shone, oblivious to its small existential crisis. Everyone out there seemed to have a destiny, a purpose. He just had a void inside that he didn't know how to fill.

It was in that precise moment of maximum vulnerability when the outside world decided to empathize with him in the most horrible way possible.

The distant hum of the city, the only background sound of his solitude, died away. It didn't fade out gradually. It was a clean cut, like a cable. The silence that replaced it was so thick that it seemed to squeeze the eardrums. Lucas held his breath, confused. He got up and went to the window.

The street was empty. Completely empty. Cars stopped, traffic lights frozen amber. Not a soul. It was the materialization of his worst nightmare: absolute loneliness, but now imposed, not chosen.

And then the window stopped showing the street. It began to reveal a wall of pure gray nothingness. It advanced, slowly and inexorably, devouring the building in front, then the one next to it. It was heading straight towards him.

Panic, a visceral panic he had never felt before, made him recoil. There was nowhere to run. Nothing entered through the window without breaking the glass, simply replacing reality.

There was no sound. Only a coldness that penetrated him to the bones and a feeling of infinite fall.

When the sensation stopped, he didn't land.  It sank. 

An icy shock enveloped him. Salty, dark, heavy. He had been thrown into the depths of an ocean. But it wasn't just any ocean. The pressure was monstrous, crushing. There was no sunlight filtering in from above, just abyssal, absolute darkness. There was no up or down, just infinite blackness in all directions.

And then, a sound. A deep, shuddering creak, like gigantic wood breaking under immense pressure. He looked down at the nothingness from which the sound seemed to emerge, and his mind refused to comprehend what his eyes were beginning to glimpse in the gloom: vast structures of rotting wood, like the remains of shipwrecks the size of mountains, writhing in the pressure. Bioluminescent mushrooms and grotesque moss that pulsed with sickly light clung to them, briefly illuminating shapes moving in the darkness. Fish with needle teeth and translucent bodies, things that were more tentacle than fish.

It was the ""Rotten Circuit."" An infinite aquatic garbage dump. A sub-biome within a larger one, a bottomless sea whose name resonated in his mind like a poisoned whisper: ""The Rain of Thalassophobia."" It was not a rain of water, but a constant rain of the horrors of the deep, of the brittle wood of ships that never existed and of the pure fear of the abyssal unknown.

Lucas, the boy who didn't know what to do with his life, felt how the inner emptiness that had always inhabited him was replaced by another infinitely vaster and more tangible. And in that absolute horror, drowning in darkness, something in him broke forever. Something went out, and something else, cold and empty, came on in its place. The principle of Void.

If you‚Äôre currently building (or seriously planning) a caf√©, coffee brand, or even a coffee-adjacent business that has a differentiator ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to hear about it. Drop a comment here or DM me with your plan.

I‚Äôm particularly interested in ideas that:
	
‚Ä¢ Go beyond just serving coffee and create a sticky customer experience
	
‚Ä¢ Have scalability potential (online/offline hybrid, unique product line, etc.)
	
‚Ä¢ Bring something authentic and original to the table

I know coffee attracts a lot of passion-driven founders, and I‚Äôd be excited to explore backing someone with both vision and execution drive.

1mzresk,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanwellneslife/comments/1mzresk/natural_energy_mindful_start/,Natural Energy & Mindful Start,"# Discovered a game-changing morning energy hack that actually works (no caffeine crash!)

Replace white sugar with piloncillo in your morning coffee/oatmeal for sustained energy without the crash.

So I've been experimenting with my morning routine because I was tired of the classic coffee-sugar-crash cycle that left me dead by 11am. Found this interesting alternative that's been working surprisingly well.

# What is jaggery?

It's basically unrefined brown sugar (common in Latin American countries). Unlike regular white sugar, it contains complex carbohydrates that metabolize more slowly.

# The difference I've noticed:

* Energy curve: Instead of sharp spike ‚Üí crash, it's more like a gentle hill that lasts 3-4 hours
* Focus: My concentration stays steady through morning meetings (huge win)
* No jitters: None of that weird anxious energy you get from sugar rushes
* Blood sugar: Way more stable (I track this with a glucose monitor)

# How to try it:

1. Get powdered piloncillo (Amazon, Mexican grocery stores, or some health food stores)
2. Start with same amount you'd use of regular sugar
3. Adjust to taste (it has a slightly molasses-like flavor)

# The science bit:

Complex carbs = gradual glucose release vs simple sugars = rapid spike and crash. Your brain gets steady fuel instead of feast-or-famine.

Been doing this for about 6 weeks now and honestly can't go back. Monday mornings actually feel manageable now.

Anyone else tried this or have similar natural energy hacks? Always looking for ways to optimize without relying on stimulants.

Edit: For those asking about availability - if you can't find piloncillo, coconut sugar or date sugar work similarly (complex carbs vs simple). The key is avoiding highly refined sugars.",1,1756130714.0,americanwellneslife,0,1.0,False

Just spent half a year (on and off, with way too much coffee) building my very first product as an indie developer!

It's ""just"" a time management toolkit, but it means the world to me üò≠

üåê **Check it out**: [ClockZone](https://clockzone.net)

## üéØ What I Built

Basically threw all the time tools I use daily into one place:
- ‚è∞ **Timer** - No more burnt dinners or missed meetings
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Stopwatch** - For when you need to time literally everything  
- ‚è≥ **Countdown** - ""How many days until Christmas?"" - Now you know
- üåç **World Clock** - Stop mental math for timezones
- üìÖ **Holiday Calendar** - Global holidays at your fingertips
- üßÆ **Date Calculators** - Business days, date math, etc.
- üîó **Embeddable Widgets** - Can be embedded into your own websites

## ‚ú® Key Features
- 40+ languages supported (thanks ChatGPT!)
- Dark mode (because we're all vampires)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Pretty decent loading speeds

## üòÖ Lessons Learned (The Hard Way)
1. **Internationalization nearly broke me** - 40+ languages, RTL layouts made me question life choices
2. **Timezones are evil** - Thought it'd be easy. I was wrong. So very wrong.
3. **Mobile responsiveness** - Still working on this one...
4. **Performance optimization** - V1 was slower than dial-up internet

## üôè Roast Me (Constructively Please)
As a complete noob, I know there's room for improvement:
- UI/UX could be better?
- Missing any crucial features?
- Anything that makes you want to rage quit?
- Did I pick the wrong tech stack?

## üí∏ Business Model? What's That?
Currently running on some ads to cover hosting costs, all features are free  
Maybe in the future:
- Premium features?
- Enterprise custom solutions?
- Other monetization ideas? (help me brainstorm!)

## üéâ Small Victories
- Server hasn't crashed yet (thanks Cloudflare!)
- Got a few nice user emails (almost cried)
- Everything actually works as intended (mostly)

---

**TL;DR**: Newbie indie dev's first project - a free time management website. Please share your brutally honest feedback, but maybe don't destroy my soul completely? ü•∞

Over the years I‚Äôve found a few things that make a big difference to how I feel on the road, so I thought I‚Äôd share.

**Before you travel:**

* Hydrate the day before (planes especially dehydrate you).
* Eat a balanced meal (protein + veg + complex carbs).
* Pack your own snacks ‚Äî nuts, oat bars, fruit, carrot sticks.
* Take a probiotic yoghurt or supplement to help your gut.
* Check out healthy restaurant/supermarket options near your hotel in advance.

**During travel:**

* Stick with water or herbal tea over sugary drinks/alcohol.
* If eating out, go for grilled meat/fish, soups, salads, or rice/veg dishes.
* Smaller portions help with bloating when you‚Äôre sat for hours.
* Don‚Äôt overdo the caffeine ‚Äî one coffee is fine, three isn‚Äôt!

**When you arrive:**

* Grab some fresh fruit/veg to get fibre and vitamins back in.
* Eat on local time as soon as possible to fight jet lag.
* Move a bit ‚Äî a short walk or stretch makes all the difference.

**Snacks I always pack:**

* Wholegrain crackers + peanut butter sachets
* Trail mix (unsalted nuts + dried fruit)
* Low-sugar protein bars
* Instant porridge sachets (super handy in hotel rooms)
* Apples or bananas

**Takeaway:** The key is balance. You don‚Äôt have to skip all treats, but being prepared with water and snacks means you arrive with more energy and less jet lag.

I know there is alot wrong with me, but too my understanding, its mainly in my head. Outside my character, qualities, etc are actually pretty good. Yet Ive still never had anyone.

I dont do drugs, I dont smoke, I dont vape, I dont drink alcohol. Hell I dont even drink coffee. I hold myself to high standards. Ive been making good and visible progress in the gym. I have a job that pays surprisingly well. I have a second job where I teach 12-18 year olds life and personal skills, which can take them far in life. The kids I teach often come to me for advice. I went through the same program when I was younger. I have plans for my future. I dont go out and party or clubbing.

I like to think I am loyal and willing to help others. I hope that I can defend myself and the ones I care about if it comes to it (never had to yet).

On paper, I would think that sounds great. For the first time ever, im starting to notice how lucky I am to have all these things.

Yet in my 20 years on this planet, not once have I had a special someone (romantically) to share it all with. Ive never done the deed, ive never even kissed someone before. I have never had a relationship, or a crush or anything. I have completely missed out on teenage romance. Never once in school did anyone tell me ""XYZ likes you"" or anything like that.

Everyday, more and more, i crave someone who i can spend time with, share the wins and the losses. Have someone who i can be there for as much as they are for me.

Looking at previous data, I have been 100% alone,  100% of the time. Considering that, evidence suggests the pattern will continue and I will be alone forever. I hate this feeling.

If i need to change myself or anything in order to finally break the cycle for the first time and have some love in my life, I will give and do anything I can to make it happen.

Please god let it end. Let me find someone who loves me. Cease this endless suffering of lonliness. If there is something I must atone for then let me do so.",2,1756130210.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

I was at a yoga class last night and the instructor said something that seems to have stuck with me... it was about being authentic and... well... making sure we are living (and appreciating) the life we have... it made me think about Why.  Why I write, why I write now (versus when I was young and carefree), what I write... and who I write it for...

There are two approaches (well, probably there are more, but I am thinking about these two) to writing: write what it is you want to say/share (you know, that thing inside that says, ""you gotta write THIS"") and write so you can sell what it is you wrote.  And it is that latter one that puts so much pressure - it makes writing a competition, a sales pitch, a marketing exercise... but what if writing to tell lesbian stories, to share experiences, to create a fictional environment where lesbians are lesbians and that's just the way it is, is what we are ""supposed to be"" doing?

Maybe it is just me, feeling split over the meaning of success.  Are we successful in ""having written"" or in ""having a market for what we have written"".  But, then, if one just writes and there is no facility to expose that writing to the world without selling it (i.e publishing), aren't we then just shouting into the wind?

[ Eureka Mignon Specialita ],"I've started using a brand new Eureka Mignon Specialita, together with my Rancilio Silvia that I've used for a while. I previously used a decent hand grinder, giving me good espresso.

I've set/determined the zero point on the grinder (burrs just touching without beans), however the ground coffee at this setting is way too coarse. 
I'm however noticing that I can set the grinder to a finer setting while grinding coffee, half a full turn of the dial, before the burrs start touching again. This extra half turn brings me well in the range of the grind size that gives me good espresso.

So in principle this would work fine, however I do feel something is not fully correct here, since the burrs would be touching again in this finer setting once the coffee runs out (yes I've tried). I'm therefore wondering:

-Should one determine the zero point of the grinder with or without beans?

-Could it be that the static burr is a bit loose, or otherwise could there be something that is allowing for some play in the grinder?

Meet the Namib Desert beetle‚ÄîOnymacris unguicularis‚Äîa creature so small it could sit on the pad of your finger, yet it possesses one of the most ingenious survival strategies I‚Äôve ever heard of. In a place where rainfall is almost mythical, this beetle turns mist into morning coffee. It climbs to the crest of a dune at dawn, faces away from the wind, and strikes a pose: rear end in the air, head down. As fog from the Atlantic drifts inland, water condenses on the bumps of its hardened back, which is textured with hydrophilic (water-attracting) and hydrophobic (water-repelling) patches. The result? Tiny droplets form, roll downhill‚Äîover the beetle‚Äôs shell‚Äîand drip straight into its mouth.

No digging, no searching‚Äîjust catching clouds.

It‚Äôs a lesson in quiet brilliance. When we think of survival, we picture strength, speed, competition. But the Namib beetle thrives through stillness and patience‚Äîby simply letting the desert breathe on it. Sometimes, the best way to endure is to know how to listen.

I went to the doctor who said it is ‚Äújust‚Äù a lipoma and nothing to worry about, but it got me seriously thinking of changing my diet. 

Over the past two years I have done intermittent fasting (IF) daily but recently have only been going 12 hours between meals. This hasn‚Äôt allowed me to reach or stay in ketosis. So I decided to ramp it up to OMAD (one meal a day), completely cutting out sugar (which I am quite fond of) as well as alcohol. I don‚Äôt drink a lot normally, but it‚Äôs usually one beer five or six nights a week. 

I am about 30 lbs overweight and it‚Äôs almost all in my midsection. I know this is not good for heart or liver health so I am hoping this diet helps. I‚Äôve read that ketosis may help reduce the size of lipomas so I am also hopeful that will occur.

I have found it remarkably easy to eat once a day (given my previous IF experience). I drink about 4 cups of black coffee each day, which I think helps, and at least two and a half liters of water. During these first few days I had a dull, lingering detox headache but nothing extreme. Really not many negatives the first five days or so.

There have been positives: My energy seemed to spike after the first couple of days, and my brain seemed more active. Within the fitst few days, my face seemed less puffy and my pants started feeling looser. I think this was due to reduction of general inflammation caused my sugar. My mood has been good and the first few days I had LOTS of energy. However, about five days in I began to see my energy levels drop, I became easily fatigued and even have periods of feeling light headed. I am guessing this may be the sugar withdrawals finally kicking in.

I don‚Äôt do a lot of exercising, but I am active. I walk a couple miles at least every other day. I did push it one evening and did some jogging and sprinting (racing my boys) and then I mowed the lawn the next day (push mower, 1/2 acre) and had a very hard time. I just kept bottoming out on energy. This was about 12 hours after my previous meal. I had to stop and start a few times - it was in the mid nineties and humid so I know I was overheating. I drank lots and lots of water, but feel like I got heat exhaustion and had a hard time recovering over the next two days. My wife says it‚Äôs because I haven‚Äôt been eating, but I don‚Äôt think so.

I bought some electrolyte powder (sugar free and very low carb) and nursed a few liters of electrolyte water over the next two days but still didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúright‚Äù for a couple days.

Of course my wife thinks I‚Äôm stupid because she ‚Äúcould never do that - go so long without eating.‚Äù But I‚Äôm seriously committed to breaking the sugar addiction and losing weight. I just hope these symptoms don‚Äôt continue for much longer! 

For my one meal, I include about 1/4 C nuts like almonds and cashews, 1/4 C cheese, a couple hard boiled eggs, a whole avocado, then a large portion of meat (usually chicken), spinach salad or saut√©ed, and a small amount of carbs like pasta or sweet potatoes. I eat until I‚Äôm full then brush my teeth to help keep myself from snacking later. I don‚Äôt really have any sugar cravings.

My goal was to try OMAD for a week but now I‚Äôm pushing it longer. I have a trip to Colorado next week and plan to be wry active so I may end up breaking it during those days - I may need the additional calorie boost between meals for energy. 

I‚Äôd love to hear your experiences with OMAD or if you think I‚Äôm crazy or doing anything wrong, or if I could do something better/different. I need encouragement! :)

I have a ""Intel Twin Lake N150 Mini PC--NucBox G2 Plus"" (name from their web site) that I plan to use for OPNSense but in the meantime, it's serving as my ""family room"" PC.

It's surprisingly performant! I compared the passmark score to my previous laptop (Lenovo Y-50) and there was only a couple percent difference. (That was my other choice, but I didn't immediately find the power brick for the Lenovo and the lid hinges are broken, Linux reports machine check exceptions, IIRC it had sound problems and is the last Lenovo I'll ever buy) so I went with the mini.

Debian Trixie booted and installed w/out any problems. It's been fun to play with. And it suspends/resumes with no problems (except my BT keyboard won't resume it - I just use a USB mouse to wake it.)

One question I have is what the maximum sustained CPU frequency is. I ran an `s-tui CPU stress test and it pops the frequency right up to 2.9GHz with temperatures at 85¬∞C. I did some searching and all I could find was turbo frequency at 3.6GHz. Can someone confirm that 2.9GHz is the maximum steady state frequency when all cores are engaged?

I'll be returning to my laptop when I retrieve it. The 21"" monitor I'm using doesn't fit my lap and sitting on the coffee table is just a bit too far away. And IAC I do need to replace my nearly 10 year old Zotac to run OPNSense.

But it seems that I can't üò£ the patches are red, flat, dry, itchy, and somewhat flaky in spots (same with my lips)- no bumps or pimple looking patches.

Okay, I THINK I may have figured out what is causing the dry lips/dry itchy red patches on my neck: keto rash!! I finally used my pictures on Grok and that was the first thing it came up with. Looking back at the timeline it makes sense. Completely forgot I was having very low blood sugar first thing in the morning so I would have about 1/2 a tsp of honey to help being it back up (dizzy with 2 kids and a baby wasn't good). Aside from the small amount of honey, I was having absolutely zero carbs. I know, not ideal, but I needed to be able to function. I got rid of it about 5 weeks ago and then a week or 2 later the rash and dry lips started. If this is in fact a keto rash, what could I do instead of reintroducing carbs!? I've heard dandelion tea and maybe some sort of black seed oil. I've haven't consumed oxalates in quite a while, so I really don't want to have to start this process all over again ü´† I've added butter back and only have decaf coffee on the weekend!

*For reference I'm 13 weeks carnivore, 11 months postpartum, and this is what I shared in carnivore group*
I need help!! I'm a 30 year old female, 11 months postpartum with my 3rd and still exclusively breastfeeding. 
Today marks 12 weeks on the carnivore diet, but the last 3-8 weeks I have been having some weird symptoms. For the last 8 weeks (when I hold still or lie down) I feel like my heart is pumping hard but not out of rhythm, I have a louder ringing in my ears, and my hands are tingly (I do chiro every other week). I have had scalp psoriasis almost my entire life and it was almost 90% gone, I was so overjoyed! But, as of 3 weeks ago it's returned and is back to being at like 60%. I also now have these dry, red, itchy patches on one side of my neck, but it is not the same as my scalp psoriasis.  I also have occasionally red, but always dry/peeling lips that seemed to pop up the same time as the neck patches. Also, my energy has seemed to decrease again, but I do wake up maybe once a night to breastfeed, but only a handful of times during the week. My cystic acne still hasn't gone away either, which I thought would be better by now, and I'm still bloating by the afternoon. 
What is going on!? I was feeling so awesome from weeks like (aside from the heart bumping and tingly limbs) 3-6, now I feel like I'm restarting... Could this be oxalate dumping again? Hormonal weirdness since I'm breastfeeding (still no period)? Something I'm eating? Something I need to incorporate?
I know this is how I should be eating and I'm not going to stop, but I just need some guidance. 

*What I typically eat* Eggs- 2-6 a day, 80/20 ground beef, ribeyes, skirt steak, sirloin, flanken ribs, occasional roast, occasional beef ribs, occasional chicken thighs, bacon, butter (was having about a stick), tallow, very occasional heavy cream, very occasional cream cheese, A2 raw cheddar, sheep's milk cheese, and a little goat cheese (cheese seems to help when I get sugar cravings), canned weekly sardines/smoked oysters, small amount of decaf coffee, and some pork rinds. I use Baja gold salt on EVERYTHING! I like my food salty!
I have since stopped butter to see if that was the culprit ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è also trying to eliminate the decaf.
I usually eat about 70/30 ratio and anywhere from 90-160g of protein depending on the day and my activity level. I've tried Re-lyte electrolytes, but they make me swell up and gain water weight so electrolyte recommendations welcome, too! I also consume some stevia.

*I will start with my mental state (short as possible) at the time and previous trauma:*

I (20-23y) previously had crush on my classmate (20-23)for 5 years, we were even flirting but I simply didn‚Äôt have the courage to ask her out cuz i was a weirdo in hs and I REGRET IT EVERY SINGLE DAY. When i finally made a move she already had a boyfriend and i moved abroad. This haunted me for 2 years straight (Nowadays not so often but i get some flashbacks)‚Ä¶ I was depressed and suicidal (Not solely because of this but was one of the reasons), didn‚Äôt talk to anyone and thought that I could never someone else again and that I‚Äôd die miserably alone, this trauma has a huge effect on my personal growth.

*About girl2:*

Few months ago I saw this girl (16-19) at the mall, she works in the shop opposite of mine and I immediately got hit with the same feelings from when i saw Girl1. I‚Äôve seen many other girls that I thought were cute but this time my heart stopped beating for the first time in 2-3 years. She is absolutely stunning in every way and I finally had crush on someone else‚Ä¶ THIS IS IT‚Ä¶ or is it?

By the way she is really shy, has very few or no friends, always sits alone and most likely never had a boyfriend before, important to remember for the following parts.

For weeks we used to smile at each other, (You might think ‚ÄúOh but thats part of her job - smile at everyone‚Äù but I had caught her staring at me many times even when we didnt make eye contact) so I started wondering if she is giving me signals like every normal human being + I was in constant battle with my heart and brain. One was telling me that its finally to move on and talk to her, the other that I‚Äôm a pathetic loser who will never get the courage to speak to someone else and that I will waste my 20s and regret it forever. 

Whenever I was at home I‚Äôd say to myself ‚ÄúIf i see her i will go and talk to her‚Äù and every time i actually went to work I stuttered, started shaking and obviously didn‚Äôt do it‚Ä¶ this probably went on for 2 months until‚Ä¶

I prayed for her for weeks/months before I finally caught her alone, she was on her break having lunch (back turned towards me so she didn‚Äôt notice me). It was another one of those promises to myself except this time i fulfilled it, but before i did i literally stood for 4-5 minutes shaking and sweating but i spoke to her

How i messed up with Girl2‚Ä¶

Everything was normal (at least thats what I think). I wasn‚Äôt dressed nicely to make a good impression, had my work clothes on but was polite throughout the entire conversation. 

I said ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôve been meaning to tell you something for a while but i think you are really cute. Do you want to go out and grab a coffee sometime?  She replied with yes and smiled, so i followed up with ‚ÄúCan i get your number?‚Äù She said yes and saved her contact on my phone. I told her that I will visit her later at the shop and I left. All normal stuff right?? 

By the way on my way out I was in disbelief‚Ä¶ I was so happy and thought that i have finally beaten the curse‚Ä¶ THAT I ACTUALLY WON AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS IN PAIN‚Ä¶ As always i thanked God for listening to my prayers but the joy didn‚Äôt last for long‚Ä¶ 

Later when i went to the shop she purposely turned her back and asked someone else to serve me even though I was the only person there‚Ä¶ I sat there for 5-10 minutes and left disappointed‚Ä¶ 

Few hours later i sent her a text asking her is she is still up for that coffee to which I didn‚Äôt receive a reply‚Ä¶ Oh silly meeeee. 3 days later i got a message from her parents saying that she is sorry about what happened, felt  ‚Äúobliged‚Äù (huhhh???) to give her number and now they want me to delete it, to whom I apologise sincerely and NEVER had any bad intentions with her. 

After that didn‚Äôt see her at work for like a week, another depression episode hit me like a truck. I thought that i made her feel disgusted to the point where she had to tell her parents and quit the job because I‚Äôm a creep.  In my mind i was a monster.  I felt terrible for days, didnt eat, sleep and often got numb throughout the days. I will admit something‚Ä¶ I even cried for days.

She was back like one week later, but this time the atmosphere at work was awkward. I started sweating and didn‚Äôt know what to expect, what if her parents are with her too? You never know how her dad might react and i didn‚Äôt want to deal with any drama. All i did that day was stare at the wall and avoid eye contact at all costs, weird af‚Ä¶

Now i hate every time i have to go to work cuz its a try not to make eye contact challenge and the atmosphere is weird. I try to sit on tables where she wont see me so she doesn‚Äôt think im stalking her. I hate myself but i still love her. But here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ i still see her staring at me (From time to time) but the difference this time is that she turns away the moment i look back. What does this even mean??

Months have passed and I still think about her no matter how hard i try not to, even planned out dates, gifts, everything‚Ä¶ just to get my dreams crushed yet again. I know i can never have her just like the other girl. And yes i still pray for her even though her answer is clearly NO. Unrequited love KILLS me and I‚Äôve been dealing with this BS for 7-8 years now‚Ä¶ i hate life

If you came this far I‚Äôd like you to give me some advice on:

*Was i too direct when i approached her? What else I should‚Äôve done?* I tried to keep the conversation and my body language normal.

*Why would she smile and say yes (Seemed genuinely thrilled) and then ignore me?? Just say no or come up with a lie like ‚ÄúI have a boyfriend‚Äù*

*Why does she stare at me if she already said no? Is she grossed?*

*How do i deal with the awkward atmosphere at work? I thought it would get better as time goes on but it clearly doesn‚Äôt.*

1mzqwm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/sahm/comments/1mzqwm4/looking_for_feedback_on_household_balance_wfh_dad/,Looking for Feedback on Household Balance (WFH Dad + SAHM with 4 Kids),"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm hoping to get some outside perspective on how much I‚Äôm contributing at home. I know every family dynamic is different, but I‚Äôd love to hear how other stay-at-home mom / work-from-home dad setups look.

My wife has been a SAHM for about 4 years now, and we have 4 amazing kids (6B, 4G, 2G, and a 3-month-old boy). Most mornings I get up about an hour before my wife with the three older kids. I‚Äôll make breakfast (usually eggs‚Äîour chickens keep us stocked), her morning espresso, and coffee for myself. While I‚Äôm at it, I usually unload the dishwasher from the dishes I did the night before. Once that‚Äôs wrapped up, I head upstairs to my home office to start work. We homeschool so I‚Äôm not leaving her solo to do all the school drop offs.

During the day, I‚Äôm pretty focused on my job. I don‚Äôt usually step away unless she specifically needs help, like wrangling kids in and out of the car for outings. I finish work around 4pm, and from there I‚Äôll either make dinner or take over kid duty so she can cook. After dinner, we usually do something as a family‚Äîwalks, park time, that sort of thing then take care of the chickens and collect the eggs. 

Evenings are where I try to take on a lot: I do bath time for the three oldest, get them dressed, brush teeth, clean up the bathroom, and then put the 2-year-old down. While my wife does some homeschool with the older two while the baby sleeps, I wrap up and then come down to help with school which is one of my favorite parts of the day. Then I bring them up for bed and get them tucked in as well. After that, I usually pick up toys and do the dishes. If I head to the basement, I‚Äôll switch or move laundry while I‚Äôm there. I also do all the ‚Äúguy chores‚Äù mow the lawn, take out the trash, etc‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm not perfect by any means, but I do try to be intentional about being both a present dad and a supportive husband. My wife and I both grew up in homes where our dads worked a lot and didn‚Äôt really do much once they were home, so I‚Äôve always tried to avoid repeating that.

That said, last night my wife told me she feels like I‚Äôm not doing enough and that she wishes we felt more like a team. Honestly, that stung to hear, because I feel like I do a lot. When I listed out what I had done that day and asked where I could have done more or give me specifics on what she meant, she just apologized and thanked me. But often, when I do things, she tends to focus more on what I missed or didn‚Äôt quite do ‚Äúright‚Äù.

So‚ÄîI‚Äôm not here to bash my wife (she‚Äôs an incredible mom, and managing four little ones all day is no joke). I‚Äôm only looking for feedback on my contributions not hers.  I really would like some honest feedback. Are there areas where I might be missing the mark without realizing it? ",1,1756129504.0,sahm,1,0.67,False

We talk a lot here about the struggles we face (of which there are many!) but I‚Äôd love to take a moment and talk about why we like the way we do what we do :)

For me I am a stay at home parent and while there are many challenges the things I like most are:

- There is a huge sense of freedom for me not having to go out and meet certain societal expectations that I used to. When I worked I was in a field where I had to dress professionally, follow many rules, laws and regulations and present myself as a well put together expert all the time. I liked it but it‚Äôs draining to constantly have to put that work mask on. At home I can dress in my comfiest clothes regardless of whether they match or look good. I can not do my hair, I can wait until 1 PM to shower (not that I do often but I CAN lol). If you are primarily at your own house many of the expectations society places on us simply don‚Äôt apply and I really appreciate that. 

- I don‚Äôt have to be places at specific times very often and therefore don‚Äôt have to rush things. My only real time constraints are in the morning when my husband is getting ready we need to be back from our walk by a certain time and then for dinner my daughter usually likes to eat by 5:30 but other than that we basically have no ‚Äòneeds‚Äô in our schedule and can be pretty flexible. 

- While I don‚Äôt *love* being the one who primarily does the housework just by virtue of being home the most I do appreciate being able to keep my house relatively clean and organized.

- I have time to work on projects or my own interests at least a little bit instead of hoping I get time on a day off or sacrificing sleep. I have never had more time for my garden and it‚Äôs wonderful!

- I LIKE not spending money. We aren‚Äôt rich so me staying home means we need to be very smart about money, being a SAHP has really helped free me from the cycle of consumerism I was caught up in and it gave me a lot of perspective on needs vs wants in terms of what I buy.

- I really love doing nothing with my daughter. We just chill together a lot. I so enjoy taking her into the garden with me to teach her things, going out and discovering cool stuff in our yard that adult me would just ignore, taking her to the beach to watch the waves. I get to connect with her with no pressure and simply enjoy her company in a way I know I would be too stressed to do as often if I was working. 

- I have always been the ‚Äòappreciate the little things type‚Äô and my world has gotten a lot smaller and slower since leaving work. It has given me such gratitude for the smallest things like snuggling with my spouse at night, a cup of coffee at the dining room table in the morning, picking blackberries from the yard, the taste of a tomato you grew, reading a book while your kid naps, going outside to watch the sunset, the sounds and smells of the ocean, a pasty from your favourite shop, the hugs you get from your baby just because.

1mzqsqo,https://i.redd.it/h0ss5i1d56lf1.png,Coq Inu (COQ) price prediction 2025-2034,"*Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. The crypto market is highly volatile, so always do your own research and follow local regulations before investing.*

This article takes a closer look at where the Coq Inu (COQ) meme coin could be headed over the next decade. From its explosive early rally to its recent pullbacks, COQ has already shown just how unpredictable meme coins can be. In this piece, you will find insights into projected price ranges across different years, factors that could drive growth, and the risks that might hold the coin back. Whether you see COQ as a playful community experiment or a high-risk investment with serious upside, this price prediction offers a clear picture of what the future could look like for one of Avalanche‚Äôs most talked-about meme coins.

# About the Coq Inu project

Coq Inu (COQ) is a meme coin built on the Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain, recognized for its lighthearted branding and humor. Unlike many tokens, it was launched by trusted community members who distributed the full coin supply and provided the initial liquidity upfront. This approach eliminates personal allocations and centralized control, keeping the project fully decentralized.

Although Coq Inu does not have a defined functional utility, its popularity comes from community enthusiasm, social media buzz, and the speculative dynamics typical of the meme coin space. According to CoinGecko, COQ was the 936th most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization as of August 24, 2025.

|**Coin Name**|Coq Inu|
|**Coin Symbol**|COQ|
|**USD Price**|$0.0000005759|

|**Circulating Supply**|69,420,000,000,000 COQ|
|**Maximum Supply**|69,420,000,000,000 COQ|

# Founders

Coq Inu was born as a community-driven meme coin, with its creators choosing to remain anonymous. What makes the project stand out is the way it was launched: respected members of the Avalanche community kicked it off without keeping any tokens for themselves. To further build trust, they fully renounced the smart contract and burned the liquidity, ensuring that the project belongs entirely to the community.

# Origin and mission

Beyond the humor and playful branding typical of meme coins, Coq Inu‚Äôs mission is to strengthen the Avalanche community through culture, collaboration, and accessibility. The project aims to create a shared identity for its supporters, blending internet meme culture with the decentralized ethos of crypto. Hence, COQ is about more than speculation; it is a social and cultural movement within Web3, where the community has full control over its future.

# Roadmap and development

Coq Inu launched with no formal roadmap or central team, but its evolution defies that structure through vibrant, community-led innovation. The vision for a dedicated **CoqNet subnet** on Avalanche has gained traction, scaling the infrastructure to support faster, fairer transfers, and developer tools, which are key for future dApps to build around COQ. Also on the horizon is **CoqCombo**, a Unity-based arcade game that rewards players with COQ; beta testing is expected by late 2025, signaling a step toward viable gamified utility.

Beyond gaming and infrastructure, Coq Inu's ecosystem is rich with grassroots projects. DeFi integrations like BENQI Finance enable users to leverage COQ as collateral, and Chainlink oracles offer real-time pricing for broader application use. NFTs and collectibles are alive and well too; **PePe Portraits**, **Coq Cards**, and the DAO-governed **CoqPics** marketplace contribute to cultural engagement and token utility. Educational and social infrastructure is also taking shape: **Coqinuniversity** offers Web3 literacy and subnet development training, while initiatives like **CoqInu Coffee** and public artworks (e.g., murals in NYC and London) help burn COQ and spread the culture beyond blockchain.

# Tokenomics

Coq Inu (COQ) follows a refreshingly transparent and community-centric tokenomics model. From its launch on December 7, 2023, the project adopted a truly fair-launch approach: the founders deposited the entire supply of 69.42 trillion COQ and 150 AVAX in liquidity, took no tokens for themselves, renounced the smart contract, and burned the initial liquidity to eliminate any central control or future manipulation. This setup creates zero taxes, no hidden fees or presale allocations, no team allocations, and a fixed, immutable supply, ensuring fairness and equality among all holders.

Since launch, COQ has grown organically, surpassing 100,000 on-chain holders by April 2025, a milestone achieved without traditional marketing or token incentives. Its ""no-intrinsic-value"" ethos emphasizes culture and community over speculation, reinforcing its identity as the playful ‚Äúcommunity coin of the Chad Chain‚Äù on Avalanche.

Beyond its memecoin persona, COQ‚Äôs tokenomics are bolstered by an expanding ecosystem that injects practical utility into its structure. The **CoqinuSwap** DEX aggregator compares trade rates across Avalanche-based exchanges, and a portion of its trading fees support COQ buybacks and token burns, contributing to deflationary pressure and long-term scarcity. Additionally, COQ has extended into emerging sectors such as DeFi, gaming, NFTs, and wallet services, giving the coin a multifaceted role within the Avalanche ecosystem.

# Coq Inu (COQ) price history

Coq Inu first appeared on the market with a very low entry price; it was $0.00000015 when it began trading on December 17, 2023. The coin‚Äôs all-time low was just **$0.00000008** on the next day (December 8, 2023), signaling an initial burst of volatility in those early hours.

As trading activity increased, COQ reached its peak in spring 2024. The coin‚Äôs all-time high was **$0.00000644** on March 9, 2024. Following that spike, the price gradually retreated through 2024 into 2025. By April 2025, COQ fell to a low point of approximately $0.00000040. Trading then hovered within the $0.00000050-$0.00000060 range in the following months. As of August 24, 2025, COQ traded at about **$0.00000057**.

# COQ price prediction for 2028

According to CoinCodex, the COQ price will significantly drop in 2028, reaching an average of $0.00000060 and a maximum of $0.00000080.

# COQ price prediction for 2030

CoinCodex predicts an average COQ price of $0.00000148 in 2030, which might reach a maximum of $0.00000232. DigitalCoinPrice foresees a more optimistic scenario, with an average price of $0.00000282 and a maximum of $0.00000298. Hence, a COQ investment at the current $0.00000057 per coin might grow by +423% by 2030.

# COQ price prediction for 2034

DigitalCoinPrice expects significant growth in the COQ price by 2034. Accordingly, COQ will trade at an average of $0.00001070 and a possible maximum of $0.00001080. So, investing in COQ at the current $0.00000057 per coin might yield a +1,795% return by 2040.

# Growth drivers and risks

Like many meme coins, Coq Inu‚Äôs success depends on a mix of culture, community momentum, and market conditions. Its fair-launch model and unique presence on Avalanche have drawn significant attention, but long-term growth will depend on whether the project can maintain hype while building real utility. Below are some of the main factors that could drive COQ‚Äôs growth, along with the risks and challenges it may face.

# Key growth drivers

* **Fair launch and community ownership:** With no team allocation, contract renouncement, and burned liquidity, COQ is positioned as a truly community-driven token.
* **Strong Avalanche ecosystem support:** Being one of the leading meme coins on Avalanche gives COQ a first-mover advantage and visibility within a growing chain.
* **Expanding utility:** Features like CoqinuSwap, as well as integration into DeFi, NFTs, and gaming, provide practical use cases beyond meme status.
* **Cultural and viral appeal:** Its humor-driven branding and community culture fuel social media traction and organic growth.
* **Deflationary mechanisms:** Buybacks and token burns tied to ecosystem activity reduce circulating supply over time.
* **Growing holder base:** Surpassing 100,000 holders shows broad adoption and grassroots strength.

# Risks and challenges

* **High volatility:** Like most meme coins, the COQ price can swing dramatically with sentiment shifts.
* **Sustainability of hype:** Without continuous engagement, meme coins risk losing cultural momentum.
* **Limited intrinsic value:** As the project itself acknowledges, COQ does not have fundamental backing, making it highly speculative.
* **Dependence on Avalanche:** Its success is tied closely to the growth of the Avalanche ecosystem, which may face its own challenges.
* **Competition from other meme coins:** New tokens regularly launch and could siphon attention or liquidity away from COQ.
* **Regulatory uncertainty:** Global scrutiny of crypto projects could affect meme coins in particular due to their speculative nature.

# Final thoughts

Coq Inu occupies an interesting space in the crypto landscape: it combines the energy of a meme coin with the structure of a fair-launch, community-driven project. Its presence on Avalanche, expanding utility through products like CoqinuSwap, and strong cultural backing give it room to grow, particularly if the community continues to support new use cases. These factors suggest that COQ could benefit from both ecosystem growth and sustained meme-driven popularity.

That said, potential investors should keep in mind that forecasts for COQ‚Äôs price remain divided. While many prediction models anticipate steady appreciation over the coming years, others point to more modest growth or even a possible decline around 2028. This uncertainty, combined with the well-known volatility of meme coins, underscores the need for careful due diligence. Anyone considering COQ as part of their portfolio should approach it with caution, weigh both the opportunities and the risks, and never invest more than they are prepared to lose.

# FAQs

# Is COQ a good investment?

COQ can be considered a speculative investment with both upside potential and considerable risk. Some forecasts suggest that it could perform well over the long term, particularly as it continues to grow within the Avalanche ecosystem. However, investors need to recognize that meme coins are notoriously volatile, and their value often shifts based more on community sentiment than on fundamentals. Anyone considering COQ should carefully evaluate their risk tolerance before investing.

# How high can the COQ price go?

Price predictions for COQ vary depending on the source, but some suggest potential long-term growth. For example, DigitalCoinPrice projects that COQ could reach a maximum price of around $0.0000108 by 2034. These predictions are only speculative and depend on many factors, including market conditions, community engagement, and the overall state of the crypto industry. Investors should treat these numbers as possibilities rather than guarantees.

# Why has the price of COQ declined significantly in the last months?

The recent decline in COQ‚Äôs price is not unusual for meme coins, which often experience sharp corrections after periods of hype. Market sentiment can shift quickly, leading to sell-offs when excitement cools or when investors take profits. Broader conditions in the crypto market, such as liquidity shifts or downturns in major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, also play a role. These factors combined have contributed to the recent downward trend, reminding investors that COQ remains a high-risk asset.

# Will COQ reach one cent soon?

It is highly unlikely that COQ will reach one cent in the near future, given its extremely large total supply and current trading levels. Achieving that milestone would require an enormous increase in market capitalization, far beyond what most meme coins have ever reached. While meme-driven rallies can cause dramatic short-term price spikes, sustained growth of that magnitude is unrealistic under present conditions. Investors should temper expectations and view such claims with skepticism.

# Should I invest in COQ?

Whether or not to invest in COQ depends entirely on your individual goals and tolerance for risk. As a meme coin, COQ carries the possibility of rapid gains, but it also comes with the danger of sudden and steep losses. The coin‚Äôs value is influenced heavily by community enthusiasm, social media trends, and market hype rather than traditional fundamentals. Anyone interested should research thoroughly and consider only investing what they can afford to lose.

# Where can I get COQ coins?

COQ can be acquired on LetsExchange, where it is available at competitive rates. To acquire COQ, users simply need to select the trading pair, complete the exchange, and store the tokens in a compatible wallet. Availability may also extend to other decentralized exchanges operating on the Avalanche network. Always make sure to use reliable platforms and take proper security measures when purchasing or storing your coins.",1,1756129241.0,LetsExchange,0,1.0,False

Between taking care of a newborn, adjusting to the sleepless nights, and trying to get back to your ""old self,"" it‚Äôs no surprise that stress is a part of the journey. But did you know that stress can actually affect your ability to lose weight after having a baby? Let me break it down for you.

**How Stress Affects Your Body**

When you're stressed, your body releases a hormone called cortisol ‚Äì also known as the ""stress hormone."" Now, cortisol isn't always a bad thing. It's part of the body‚Äôs natural response to stress. But here‚Äôs the thing: if you're constantly stressed (which, let‚Äôs face it, is pretty common after childbirth), this hormone can actually make it harder to lose weight.

One of the ways cortisol messes with your body is by increasing your appetite. Yep, it triggers cravings for comfort food, like sweets or fatty foods. And, when you're grabbing whatever you can just to get through the day, those extra calories add up, and your body starts storing fat ‚Äì especially around your belly. Not exactly what you‚Äôre aiming for when you‚Äôre trying to shed the baby weight.

**How Does Cortisol Impact Weight Loss?**

It‚Äôs not just about eating more. High cortisol levels also slow down your metabolism, making it harder for your body to burn fat efficiently. So, even if you're working out and eating well, cortisol might be putting the brakes on your progress. This is why losing weight postpartum can feel like a slow battle, especially if you‚Äôre dealing with stress on top of everything else.

**Managing Stress After Baby**

**-Sleep (Even If It's Just a Little)**: Getting enough sleep is one of the best ways to lower cortisol levels. I know, I know, with a newborn, sleep isn‚Äôt exactly abundant. But every bit counts! If you can manage to squeeze in a nap here or there, take it. The more sleep you get, the more your body can handle stress and the better it can work toward losing that baby weight.

**- Take a Deep Breath**: Literally. Stress reduction starts with breathing. Try to take a few minutes each day to practice deep breathing or mindfulness. It cann help lower cortisol levels and calm your nervous system. Even if it‚Äôs just a quick 5-minute break, it can make a world of difference.

**--Exercise (When You‚Äôre Ready)**: Once you're cleared by your doctor, even light exercise can help. A walk, a short yoga session, or some gentle stretching can do wonders for your stress levels. It releases endorphins (the ‚Äúfeel-good‚Äù hormones) and helps you feel a little more balanced and energized. And, bonus, it helps with weight loss too!

**- Take Time for Yourself**: Whether it‚Äôs a bubble bath, reading a book, or a quick coffee break (alone!), giving yourself a little ""me time"" can significantly reduce stresss. It‚Äôs not selfish‚Äîit‚Äôs necessary for your mental and physical health.

**-Talk to Someone**: Sometimes, just talking things out can help you feel less stressed. Whether it‚Äôs your partner, a friend, or even a professional, having someone to listen and support you can make all the difference.

**-  Eat Right, But Don't Stress About Perfection**: Eating well helps your body cope with stress better. But, don‚Äôt add more pressure on yourself by trying to be perfect. Try to focus on whole, nourishing foods, but it's okay if you indulge here and there. Remember, this is about balance.

Fortified/Tireless: +4 max health/Stamina. - Not a fan. You'll be chowing down on food to restore stamina anyways, and that restores health as well as stamina. You'll hardly ever need these. If tireless came earlier, I'd probably give it more credit, but it's deep in the blacksmithing skills (level 45) and by then you probably won't need it because you'll have enough baked potatoes to shame a texan wedding.

Hasty: +4% speed boost. - Godly. Get you a full set of hasty armor and some coffee, and you'll be rocketing across the landscape like a cracked out spider monkey.

Weapons:

Leeching - +1 hp restoration every time you attack something with this weapon. Again, you're chowing down on food to restore stamina, which also restores HP. handy in a pinch, but it should never get bad enough that you'll need this.

Sharp - +1 attack power. Useful. that +1 damage adds up, and some monsters have odd amounts of health, so you might wind up killing a monster slightly faster. Which means less chance for it to hurt you. Still not spectacular, but better than leeching.

Tools: 

Lightweight - sometimes drop stamina orbs. Useful again, but not critical. BUT it's the only infusion for tools, so might as well get this on everything you got. Quite handy if you're in the middle of a big project on your farm.

  
Cooking:

Fairy: Revive once on fainting. If you ever need this, I'll be shocked. As I've said before, food restores health and stamina, and there are never enough enemies throwing enough powerful attacks at you to really warrant this. Plus it fights for space with the GOAT of food infusions.

Restorative: health and stamina regen. Early game this is a godsend. It's not a HUGE amount of regen, but when you're living on a shoestring budget, any extra regen is incredible. It might be what gets you that bag upgrade a day earlier.

Speedy: Not worth it. A temporary movement speed boost can be handy, but you're not gonna be chowing down on food to get to a place faster. or you shouldn't anyways.

Likeable: Skip, go straight to lovable.

Lovable: very handy to boost relationships. I personally like the challenge of figuring out what Reina (my personal choice of romantic partner) likes from context clues and dialogue, but if you want to raise relationships as efficiently as possible, this infusion is the one for you. 

Magical: Restores one mana orb on consumption. This is it. This is what we did all those upgrades to our kitchen for. This is why we made endless platters of sliced turnips and baked potatoes to get. Once you have the ingredients to make 4 star food (or better) reliably, you'll never want that regen infusion again. Just chow down on some magic food and cast restoration. Don't feel like watering today and are out of MP? Chow down on a magical slice of pumpkin pie (whipped cream optional), and summon a rainstorm. The possibilities are endless.

1mzqmns,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerInUse/comments/1mzqmns/should_you_upgrade_to_the_best_electric_kettle/,Should You Upgrade to the Best Electric Kettle Breville Smart Kettle?,"I‚Äôve been using the Breville BKE845BSS Smart Kettle Luxe for several months now, and it feels like I‚Äôve joined the realm of tea enthusiasts who won‚Äôt settle for anything less than perfection. This isn‚Äôt your run-of-the-mill electric kettle. It‚Äôs one of those products that merges intelligence with functionality, and it truly stands out in the world of small kitchen appliances.

**Sleek Design and Build Quality**  
At first glance, the brushed stainless steel finish immediately caught my eye. It doesn‚Äôt just look premium; it feels durable too. The thoughtful design, like the hinged lid that softly opens, prevents splashing and steam burns. With dimensions of 7"" x 9.5"" x 9.9"", it fits snugly on the countertop without occupying too much space. The 360-degree base is another nifty feature, providing cordless convenience and cord storage. Cleaning it is a breeze since the surface easily wipes clean, adding a dose of practicality to its elegance.

**Ease of Use and Smart Features**  
One major selling point for me was how user-friendly this kettle is. With five preset temperature settings, I can brew everything from Oolong tea to French press coffee without wondering if I‚Äôve overheated or underprepared the water. The one-touch control simplifies the entire process, and the keep-warm feature ensures my water stays at the optimal steeping temperature for up to 20 minutes. Breville nailed it when designing this usability-focused appliance.

**Advantages**  
Its standout features have definitely made my mornings easier.  
- The temperature presets cover a variety of beverages like green, black, and white teas and even coffee.  
- The soft-top lid ensures a safe and mess-free pour.  
- The keep-warm button is a game-changer for lazy mornings or afternoons spent sipping multiple cups of tea.  

[Check Breville BKE845BSS1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://maisea.com/p/b07t23dyjb/)

**Performance and Practicality**  
The actual performance of this kettle is where it earns its keep. Boiling water happens incredibly fast, thanks to the 1500-watt power. I do some traveling for work, and the cordless functionality has proven to be a convenient feature in my kitchen routine. The kettle is lightweight, weighing just 3.86 pounds, so moving it to and from the base doesn‚Äôt feel like a chore.

**Drawbacks**  
While it delivers in most areas, there are a few quirks I noticed:  
- The kettle can be a bit loud when boiling water.  
- It might not be the best choice for budget-minded buyers.  
- The polished design is prone to fingerprints, which can make it look less pristine over time.  

**Alternative Products**  
In comparison to other electric kettles, such as the Cuisinart CPK-17 or the Fellow Stagg EKG, the Breville Smart Kettle Luxe holds its ground well. The Cuisinart model offers similar temperature customization but lacks a soft-open lid, which makes the pouring experience slightly messier. The Fellow Stagg EKG, on the other hand, wins in style points but comes at an even steeper price. For me, the Breville kettle strikes a balance by incorporating necessary features at a slightly more palatable price point than the Fellow model.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
While this kettle isn‚Äôt the cheapest option on the market, it absolutely justifies its value given the advanced features and build quality. Its performance rivals more expensive models while offering premium design elements and practical features. For anyone who takes their tea or coffee seriously, the Breville Smart Kettle Luxe feels like a worthy investment.

I see a lot of posts about Staub dutch ovens, and similar (and I do love my dutch ovens) but by far these are my two favorite Staub pieces. In part because of the quality / ease of use, and in part because I've never seen anything like them elsewhere.

I loved the look of the kettle the very first time I saw it. I initially wanted the solid black (I can't be the only one who prefers the all black pieces?), but couldn't justify the full price.  I finally spotted one on clearance in grenadine, and snatched it up.

Such a great little kettle! I'm not a HUGE tea drinker, but I whip this out for pour-over coffee when my husband is away, and--as a bonus--it is AMAZING as a little ramen or noodle pot.  The handle locks the lid in place, and when the noodles are done you just pour off some or all of the water, no additional draining required.  If you're making a single serving of soup, you can add dried veggies or broth right back into the kettle to soften before serving.

The bread pan is so amazing, I've got my eyes peeled for a second one.  The sides are tall and steep, which leads the bread to rise almost steeply vertical, and I make a soft sandwich loaf in this at least once a week, which comes out beautifully.

As someone who practically lives on coffee, getting to try out a single-serve brewer with such a sleek design and versatile features felt like a treat. This espresso machine clearly aims to cater to those who appreciate well-crafted coffee quickly, but there are a few things you might need to know before diving in.

**Stylish and Compact Design**

The design caught my attention immediately. With its compact size of 14""D x 8.6""W x 10.4""H, it fits snugly on my countertop without taking up much space. I like how the dark gray color adds a modern, understated touch to my kitchen. It's an option I'd definitely recommend if you care about aesthetics or have limited counter space. On top of that, the use of 35% recycled plastic strikes me as a thoughtful nod to sustainability without compromising on build quality. You can truly feel the balance between style and functionality here.

**Performance and Functionality**

This single-serve brewer delivers coffee in five distinct sizes, and I tested each of them during my caffeine routines‚Äîsometimes even doubling up on my mornings. Whether I brewed a quick espresso shot or went for a 12oz coffee on a lazy Sunday, it consistently crafted a robust and aromatic cup. The smart barcode technology ensures optimal brewing by reading the code on each pod, which I thought was a clever touch. It‚Äôs effortless, especially for people like me who just want a hassle-free coffee fix. The water tank being removable and accessible from the side is another detail I found convenient.

Check [Nespresso BNV121DGR1BUC1] price on Amazon.

**Highlights**

- Compact, sleek design easily suits small spaces.
- Automatic brewing adjustments based on pod barcodes.
- Offers variety with five different cup sizes.
- Easy maintenance with a removable water tank.

**Quality and Taste**

One of the biggest strengths of this machine lies in the quality of each brew. Every cup had that signature creaminess and depth of flavor you'd expect from premium coffee houses. I also noticed how consistent the results were across the various pods I tried. It's a machine that understands the art of coffee, which is something enthusiasts will appreciate. The included capsule-tasting pack gave me a chance to sample different varieties without committing to a full pack right away. Bonus points for that!

**Drawbacks to Note**

While the pros impressed me, there are some limitations worth noting.  

- Reliance on Nespresso Vertuo pods can get expensive over time.  
- The machine occasionally felt noisy during brewing.  
- Requires occasional descaling for optimal performance.

**Rival Brands**

Comparing this product with others like the Keurig K-Elite, a few differences surfaced. The Keurig focuses on affordability and compatibility with a broader range of pod brands, which might be preferable for those on a budget. However, the Nespresso Vertuo POP+ excels in delivering richer flavors and a creamier texture. It also seems to win on design, fitting way better into modern kitchens than most Keurig models. If you want to prioritize flavor and style, the Vertuo POP+ pulls ahead, but for those seeking affordability and availability of pods, Keurig might still be appealing.

**Cost Efficiency**

The cost of this espresso machine feels justifiable if you're the kind of person who prioritizes great coffee every single day. Its versatility, ability to brew multiple cup sizes, and delivering results close to barista-quality genuinely make it worth considering. However, keep in mind that using branded pods adds up over time, so weigh how often you‚Äôll use it against those recurring costs.

1mzqio0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1mzqio0/adulting_is_hard_but_possible/,Adulting is hard but possible,"I came across this sub today and wanted to share my story. I grew up the son of a plumber and an office secretary. Two hardworking parents who made ends meet with a small home in the fields of rural Iowa. In our world, trades were the norm and respectable work. College wasn‚Äôt something we talked about at the dinner table and because of that I didn‚Äôt really work hard in school I just got by. I figured I‚Äôd follow the path I knew best, become a tradesman maybe an electrician or maybe get into plumbing like my dad and start my own business. Work hard, provide, and keep the lights on literally and figuratively.

But life has a strange way of redirecting us.
I was offered a free course my senior year to become an EMT. It was the first time I felt purpose and that‚Äôs where I discovered medicine, deep in the back of an ambulance, navigating chaos with a calm voice and steady hands. I became a paramedic, and while I loved the work, the paycheck barely covered the rent (EMTs and paramedics are criminally underpaid). I was passionate, but broke and exhausted. 

It didn‚Äôt feel sustainable, so I pushed forward. I went back to school, got my bachelor‚Äôs degree in nursing, and became an RN. It was a big step one that took sacrifice, late nights working in the ambulance, and more coffee than I care to admit. But it opened doors. Still, I knew I wasn‚Äôt done. I kept going, earning my Family Nurse Practitioner degree while working in the ICU, expanding my skills, and stepping into more responsibility.

Finally, at 35 years old, after years of school, clinicals, and basically three semesters off since high school, I graduated from Nurse Anesthesia school.

It took everything I had. Emotionally. Mentally. Financially. I studied when I wanted to sleep. I worked when I wanted to quit. I missed parties, family events, vacations, but I never lost sight of the finish line. And now, at 36, I‚Äôve not only finished that journey, I feel fulfilled. I‚Äôm married, I have a three year old, and we just bought our first home last year. 

Let me be honest, adulting is hard, sometimes, impossibly hard and I often joked as a millennial I would never own a home in this economy. Bills don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre tired. Deadlines don‚Äôt care about your mental health. And success can feel like a mountain always one peak away. But I‚Äôm here to tell you, you can make it.

You don‚Äôt need to have it all figured out at 20. Or 25. Or even 30. I certainly didn‚Äôt.  Life is not a race, it a process. A layering of small wins over time. My path wasn‚Äôt linear. It was full of pivots, setbacks, and years where I questioned if it was all worth it, but I kept going. And so can you.

If you‚Äôre feeling stuck, discouraged, behind in life, you are not alone. Your timeline is valid. Your progress matters. And with hard work, perseverance, and a stubborn refusal to quit, you can build a life you‚Äôre proud of no matter where you started. Keep going. Keep building. Adulting is hard. But we will make it.",3,1756128530.0,Adulting,1,1.0,False
1mzqig7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1mzqig7/not_losing_weight_postpartum/,Not losing weight postpartum,"Can anyone please help me make sense of things and point me to the right direction, because I‚Äôm losing my mind trying to figure out what I‚Äôm doing wrong.

32F, 167cm, 72kg.

Tl;dr: Not losing weight 1 year postpartum. Exercising 2x/week, daily walks + running around after an active tiny human. Balanced diet with some indulgences here and there. Also breastfeeding & overactive thyroid. 

Full story: 

I am currently 1 year postpartum and struggling to lose weight. I gained 17kg during pregnancy - started at around 65kg. During the first few months after delivery my weight was dropping steadily until it reached 72kg. Now I‚Äôve been stuck with 72kg for the past 10 months and it just doesn‚Äôt move no matter what I do.

Exercise:
1. I walk daily (brisk walks). My 6 month average is 13.5k daily steps (9.3km distance).
2. I go to fit mama low and slow (crossfit) classes 2x/week. The classes are 1 hour long, and it is all strength training of varying levels of difficulty. I burn an average of 250 active calories during the class (according to my apple watch).
3. General - I have an active one year old, who barely lets me sit down and keeps me on my feet most of the day.

Diet:

I eat what I think is a fairly balanced diet, consisting of fruits and veggies, legumes, meat, fish, and grains. All food is homecooked, with an occasional take out, or eating out once per week or biweekly. The absolute worst thing I used to do until recently is treat myself to a late night snack of a packet of crisps split with my husband (it honestly feels like an addiction lol. However, I‚Äôve been good these past few weeks with no crisps and still my weight hasn‚Äôt moved). 

I drink my coffee with 2% milk and no sugar. I drink maybe 2-3 cans of soda/month. Apart from that I only drink water.

Due to my baby's allergies I eliminated all wheat products (so no bread).

I know it would be very useful in my case and I‚Äôm trying to track calories, but I find it difficult and time consuming on top of everything else. The few days I have been tracking it, I ate around 1800-2000kcal/day. 

Additionally:
1. I still breastfeed (allegedly it burns around 500kcal/day and utilizes fat)
2. I have a slightly overactive thyroid, so technically I should be losing weight. This is the part which baffles me completely.

Basically, as far as I understand it, I probably have a slow metabolism. But I don‚Äôt get how I can get it going again? 

I‚Äôm not expecting major results fast, especially during the period where I wasn‚Äôt exercising. But I‚Äôve been exercising 2x a week and making changes to my diet for the past 6 months and I don‚Äôt see any result - I‚Äôm not losing weight and I‚Äôm not slimming down in size. What I am losing though is my motivation to continue. The classes I go to are not easy for me, and I am pushing myself and working as hard as I can.

1mzqhnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mzqhnd/i_23f_think_im_in_love_with_my_best_friend_21f/,I (23F)  think I'm in love with my best friend (21F) and I'm not sure if I'll ruin our friendship by telling her. Could you give advice on whether I should tell her?,"TLDR: pretty sure I'm in love with my best friend of 10 years and I don't know if I should risk telling her.



I (23F) have been friends with my best friend (21F) for 10 years. We have grown up together and I can't imagine my life without her. I'm sure you can imagine my reluctance in telling her that I definitely have feelings for her and I'm probably in love with her. Until about 6 months ago I thought I was Aromantic (I'm definitely asexual) so imagine my shock when I got back from a trip to visit her and all I could think about was waking up by her side and going about our regular routines but somehow they were better because we did them together and the mundane things didn't seem so tedious anymore because she was by my side when I did them. 

I'm terrified to risk my friendship with her because and I can barely remember a time without her there. When she was 18 she moved out of state to college and has lived about 12 hours away for 3 years. I go visit her for about 9 days every 6 months and they're the best 9 days of my year. When she graduates she wants me to move out of my state and move in with her. There is a possibility she likes me as well but the line between platonic and not has always been blurry with us. Whenever she talks about the future she talks about me being there. We've discussed buying a starter home together when our careers are stable and there has never been a moment where she planned for the future and didn't involve me either in her plans or in her decision making. There is a possibility she has feelings for me as well but I'm terrified to lose her. I tried to ignore the feelings but well it's been 6 months since I even noticed the feelings and it's only getting ""worse"" as the days roll on by and it has rapidly grown since I visited in June. 

There are multiple issues with all of this. 1. She might not return my feelings and things could get awkward.  2. she is a hypersexual Bisexual so not having sex isn't ideal for her and well I'm a sex repulsed Asexual so we couldn't be more incompatible in bed (not that I think she would hold that against me if we actually became a thing) 3. If I told her about my feelings today I wouldn't be able to move in with her for about *checks watch* **a year to a year and a half** so basically if I told her right this very minute we would likely be long distance for the first year of our relationship 4. If I wait to tell her she might get into a relationship when she gets back from her out of state internship in December. So basically I have until December to decide if I want to tell her and potentially risk losing my best friend and the best thing that's ever happened to me. 

I need advice, any advice. I can't talk to my family about this and I clearly can't talk to my best friend about this. I just don't want to lose her. What if I wake up and there aren't any notifications from her sending me things hours before I wake up? What if I never get to walk with her and her dog to the coffee shop down the street? Who will I lean against as we play video games together? Will I put salt on my popcorn in the future out of habit because that's how she always liked it? What if I never have to take her dog outside late at night because she goes to bed early and I don't want the dog to wake her up? What if I say one of our inside jokes but she isn't there to respond? Will I never again be woken up by my phone ringing because she absolutely had to tell me something that very second because I was the person she wanted to tell the most? 

I've been through a lot in my life and I've always been terrified of my future because of how people have ruined it but it's never been as terrifying as the idea of her not being there. With her my uncertain future isn't so terrifying. She has always been a constant in my life and the idea of losing her is causing me more grief than I've felt in years. I've shed a few tears typing this because I can't get over the idea of not being in her life. Going 6 months without seeing her is excruciating so I can't imagine the rest of my life without hearing her laugh or being able to poke her dimples when she smiles. Please give me any advice you can give me. ",2,1756128459.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False

1mzqfby,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mzqfby/she_didnt_reply_a_text/,She didn't reply a text,"I'll try to be objective in what I'm about to say. After a recent break-up, I decided to date again. Just to give some context: I'm Latino and recently moved to the US for my PhD program. Last Thursday afternoon, I met briefly a South Korean girl on the streets.

As we were about to cross the streets side by side, we exchanged a smile. Then, I asked her if she was going to X university, and the conversation unfolded. While talking, she gave me the impression that she was introvert in personality; she was very cute, a bit shy, but very warm and smiley as she seemed comfortable talking with me. We exchanged phone numbers and IGs. It was the best thing that happened to me last Thursday afternoon.

Yesterday morning, around 10 am (yeah, I'm an early bird), I texted her on Whatsapp a very brief message: ""Hey, nice to see you last Thursday..Want to grab coffee on campus sometime?"" 

So far she hasn't replied, and I doubt she will ever reply to me. A South Korean friend later told me that my message was (a bit) direct for someone who comes from Korea and is been living in the US for less than a month. Also, South Koreans don't typically use WhatsApp, so she might not be accustomed to it. Moreover, he warned me that follow-up messages (too soon) tend to be taken as very obsessive or even creepy, probably due to the culture of South Korea, and suggested I should just say hi again if I ever see her again on campus. 

What do you think South Koreans or anyone who has wanted to get to know someone from South Korean in the USA? 

I'm not pretending to be naive and either text her again today or this upcoming week or not talking to other girls in the meantime (through apps or hangouts). But, I did find this South Korean girl very interesting to just not send a follow-up message, saying playfully something like: ""Haha maybe my coffee invite was too direct. My apologies, just thought I'd be fun to have a coffee break from study grind"" (yeah, I've been preparing my follow-up message; it doesn't seem it would hurt her if I send this message. If she doesn't reply, I'll move on).",2,1756128301.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I know there have been a lot of Hawaii posts recently but my boyfriend and I just got back from Oahu/Lanai/Kauai and I figured I‚Äôd throw my review in for another data point! We stayed at Ritz Turtle Bay, Sensei Lanai, and 1 Hotel Hanalei Bay, but I‚Äôll do a different post of each so I can attach video of the rooms and extra photos.

I‚Äôll start with the Ritz Turtle Bay Resort:

*Service*: Everyone was friendly and quick to help us, valet at the front, and everything was as expected. We didn‚Äôt really have any major problems/requests to test the system, but we did have a staff member comp us on a birthday drink, and everyone seemed genuinely happy/cheerful with lots of random ‚Äúmahalo!‚Äù as we passed. I did get stung by a bee at one point and they brought me ice, Benadryl, and bandaids with some sort of cream (believe it was hydrocortisone/anti-itch) pretty much immediately. Complementary lei on arrival.

*Location*: Stunning! They‚Äôve done an excellent job with their pools in particular. Layered infinity pools were A+. The lobby seating with the couch inset into the infinity pool was also a gorgeous place for a coffee and a pastry in the morning. I remember seeing a negative review about cleanliness but that wasn‚Äôt our experience‚ÄîI actually looked around a bit because I read that and it passed my QC. :)

*Activities*: Varied and kid-friendly too if you‚Äôre looking for that. We *really* enjoyed the shark cage diving. We did the Mauka Warrior Luau as well and while the performers were great, they oversold the show so it was uncomfortably crowded despite paying the VIP ticket entrance.

*Food*: They have a few places to eat here from casual to a bit more formal, but we liked Alaia the best (slightly more formal than Roy‚Äôs Beach House or the coffee shop).

Overall, I found it a pretty solid choice for Oahu and I had a great time. ",17,1756128209.0,chubbytravel,6,1.0,False

Lately, I've been practicing Interloper spawns at TM, and my main goal was to reach the summit. Now, no matter how I try, I can never reach it (mostly because I have no sleeping bag).

Like in my last attempt, I had plenty of resources, woke up in prep cache, and went straight to the summit. I climbed the first rope, carefully avoided the bear, went through the cave, made a fire to make some tea (spent about 1h there), and then went to the summit rope. I was able to reach the first ledge, but then I was too exhausted, and the game simply wouldn't let me go any further.

Am I doing something wrong, or is it impossible to reach the summit without coffee/stim/sleeping bag (straight after spawn)?",1,1756128112.0,thelongdark,5,1.0,False
1mzqcdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1mzqcdb/reflections_of_travelling_in_the_caribbean_well/,Reflections of travelling in the Caribbean (well some of it),"Greetings! 

I recently spent 7 weeks overseas, mostly in the Caribbean. Having browsed some Reddit posts for advice and insights on travelling the region before my departure, I found there to be some misconceptions or just a general lack of information which may help a traveller/backpacker. I thought I would share my experiences for the benefit of others, if not just to share for one's curiosity.

Summary:
The Caribbean is a beautiful place to visit. 
- The food options are great: jerk chicken, jerk pork, seafood, curried goat, the infusion of local spices (turmeric, paprika, nutmeg etc). 
Coffee, chocolate and rum are also locally made in abundance. 
- The temperature is consistent and good for beach days, although it's no surprise the afternoons can be rather quiet as many locals are staying cool at a bar or food venue, or under a tree. 
- Everywhere I went the people were very accommodating and appreciative to receive a roaming Aussie traveller;  a ""direct"" flight path to the region is ~36 hours after all. 
- Safety was on my mind throughout, so I avoided putting myself in too many risky situations. In saying that, Jamaicans for example have an unwritten rule/convention not to harm tourists because it would only serve to hurt the rest of Jamaica (this cultural norm may apply to other islands as well). 
-I was perhaps lucky to avoid wet season weather, with the season lasting from july to December depending on the country.
-Travelling across islands can be tedious with not every island having direct flights regularly (if at all), and the price can be expensive (om sea transport, there ia a ferryboat between Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, and small islands between Grenada and St Vincents and the Grenadines). 
-Backpacking in hostels is not always an option, so airbnbs can come in handy. 
-Don't set your expectations high especially as everything operates on island time - enjoy it!

Background context:
I [30m] am from Australia. I have been fortunate to have travelled a number of times, including 3 separate backpacking adventures to Europe. My instigation for travel to the Caribbeam was to watch Australia play the West Indies in cricket. I was with a friend for Washington DC, Barbados and Grenada, the rest I was solo travelling. 
Countries and towns visited are listed:
- Barbados (Bridgetown)
- Grenada (Grand Anse, St Georges, Carriacou Island)
- Jamaica: New Kingston, Ocho Rios, Montego Bay
- Dominicans Republic : Santo Dominigo, Las Terrenas
- Puerto Rico: Isla Verda, El Yunque, Old San Juan
- Canada: Montreal
- US: Washington DC, Chicago, Milwaukee

Start
USA: Washington DC - was the start but I'll cover this below 
Much had been said of the USA of late, especially about entering the country and the risk of being turned away, taking a second phone etc. I had no issues or concerns entering the country, or travelling through it. Having your itinerary in order (length of stay, address of stay, departure date) is advised. My stay was enjoyable, the Smithsonian's (African American museum was my favourite), the spy museum and a few dining venues occupied my brief stay here.

Barbados
Small and flat. My friend and I did not leave the Christ Church area of Bridgetown except for cricket and a rum tour. We visited the Stade's rum distillery, went to Kensington Oval, walked through some of Bridgetown town after game day, attended the annual horse races, and beached nearby the Hilton Hotel at Pebbles Beach. 
We mostly took Haylup and taxis to get around. Speaking to locals, we were told of areas to generally avoid, however, we otherwise felt safe (there were a couple of instances a night where we were mindful of followers, but they were just going about their business in coincidence). Local street food and shops are significantly cheaper, and the people really appreciated us dining with them.
Overall Barbados was fairly expensive, with prices somewhat comparable to Australian/US prices. People were accommodating and friendly, and the few beaches we saw were great (Brighton Beach near the rum distillery was the best looking one we saw)

Grenada is small, forested, and very hilly. My friend and I traversed the island in a day by hiring a car, seeing waterfalls, chocolate factories, lookout points, a nice water view hotel, and smaller towns and communities. We stayed on the hill close to Grand Anse Beach (a steep walk up and down), and frequently took local buses to get into St George's and out of (each ride was about $2.5 ECD or $0.75 USD). A short haylup ride away from Grand Anse are great bars like the West Indies Beer Company and Lavo Lanes, popular with locals and the international student contingent. 
The highlight was taking the Osprey Ferry from St Georges to Carriacou Island. Tickets were $80 ECD ($31 USD) one way or $160 ECD ($62 USD) return, and the ferry takes approximately 1:45 one way (it can be very choppy so I recommend seasickness tablets). Carriacou is very small, and still visibly damaged from the hurricane (Beryl) in 2024. Perfect for food, drink and beach; Paradise Beach is simply divine with a few venues there, and the ability to boat out to Sandy Island a few hundred metres away. Airbnbs or hotels only on the island. Greensborough is the main town, very small with a few nice venues to choose from. You can take a ferry to Union Island which is St Vincents and the Grenadines (I didnt do it but i locals told us). People there were both surprised and grateful my friend and I were there, especially on the 12 month anniversary of the hurricane. Grenada was cheaper than Barbados, and perhaps my favourite island. I felt most safe in Grenada, even in the bustling town centre and market place. Grenada Golf Club is also a nice afternoon. 

Jamaica
Much bigger than Barbados and Grenada, and similarly priced to Barbados. It's reputation for safety had improved with the government intent on improving security, especially with elections in 2025. UBER WORKS IN BUILT UP AREAS like Kingston, Montego Bay, Ochos Rios - I never had any problems, and it was cheap. Knutsford Express was the best way to travel longer distances across the island. HOSTEL'S EXIST in Jamaica! I stayed in 2 hostels: Ragamuffin in New Kingston (very good hostel in a nice area close enough to everything in Kingston; credit to the team there!), and Inez Roots Hostel in Montego Bay (lovely hosts, small but good plans for expansion in the works. Unfortunately an awkward spot on the hill , a good 30-40 minute walk away from Montego Bay town centre and the hotels and venues, and a rather shanty-like neighbourhood. In saying that, every Jamaican I spoke to about traveller safety said that there's like an unwritten rule in the country to not impact tourists for it will affect everyone in the country: just don't put yourself in silly positions (e.g. walk aimlessly and alone at night, hit on someone's partner - I was told that is a guaranteed way to be seriously hurt!).
I went to: Sabina Park for cricket, Port Royal for the Fort and unsuccessfully to Lime Quay; Craighton Estate coffee plantation, Bob Marley Museum in New Kingston (there are 2 in the country), Emancipation Park, Luminescent Lagoon boat tour near Falmouth/Florence Hall Village - RECOMMENDED at $25 USD), Dunn River waterfalls, and Devon House. 
Overall I enjoyed Jamaica, but got fatigued by the end because people were quite assertive with me, always trying to hustle something for more money. You will also be charged more for pretty much every service as a tourist (i was also told that sometimes even locals get charged more than normal).

Dominican Republic 
Really enjoyed my brief time here. Basic Spanish is recommended (pleasantries and greetings) as English is not widely spoken. I stayed confined to Zona Colonial as outside of there was less secure. I found the Colonial Zone to be a nice blend of a Caribbean town and European old towns. Island Life Hostel was brilliant, with plenty of social and quiet space and amenities: a small pool, pool table, dart board, and a cool bar and options to join the social chat on whatsapp. The hostel also has food info for local tourism and advice like dancing, cooking, spanish classes etc). Uber works well. The Three Eyes park is a short uber ride away and about $5 USD (RECOMMENDED). The bus network across the island is accessible and doesnt cost much. Santo Dominigo to Las Terrenas was $400 RD ($8 USD) one way. 
Las Terrenas is beautiful. A small tourist town with hotels, A GREAT HOSTEL and many small shops, but not many people (a lot less than you would expect in Punta Cana and Puerto Plata I believe). Hostel 23 is fantastic and run by a good family, and volunteers from around the world. Very social with space to chill. Also features a group chat. The waterfalls (cascada de limon) are worth a visit via local bus ($200 pesos or $4USD one way), as is Playa Bonita (an aptly named beach). Mopeds as taxis can get you around Las Terrenas easily and are around 200 pesos from the hostel to Playa Bonita or bus (autobus) terminal.
Dominican republic was similar in pricing to Grenada, and very affordable. My second favourite behind Grenada.

Puerto Rico
Imagine the USA on island time, and the main language and culture was Spanish. Uber is available. Nomads Hostel Isla Verde Beach was really nice, a 5 minute walk from the beach, 10-15 minutes bus/uber from Old San Juan, 40 minutes drive from El Yunque National Park, and was located close to a cafe, bakery, food options and a supermarket. 

Canada: Montreal
Very expensive coming from Australia. The exchange rate, taxes and tips can make meals climb from CAD$21 to CAD$28. I was visiting a friend here and was shown around most of the city highlights. I took a Bixi bike around Circuit de Gilles Villeneuve (escooters don't work!) and explored the island generally - very pretty.  Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal is worth a visit. The city otherwise reminded me of home (Melbourne), except for the Quebecois culture. 

USA: Chicago, Milwaukee
Going back to what i mentioned earlier, I think the securitisation of travel to the US for leisure is blown out of proportion and sensationalised. Yes, people are being refused entry and deported, there's no denying that. However, if you have a valid visa (ESTA in my case), clear entry and exit dates, and communicate what your intentions are, you will seldom have any problems (they ask certain questions where I said I was visiting for a holiday, stated the address of my accomodations and said how long I was staying. Interestingly,  they never asked for proof of exit flights but that might just be customs officer of the day or due to the fact I'm from what is considered a friendly country, and they took my honest word!).

Coming from Australia, the US is rather expensive largely due to the exchange rate, taxes and then tipping. Washington DC is great for the Smithsonian museums, happy hour food and beverage options (makes eating out quite affordable), and has quite a bit happening in general. There are still areas that are shady and worth avoiding (locals can tell you). For all the noise and pomposity of the politics, Americans are still friendly and willing to help you.
Chicago felt like a greener, quieter New York city. Public transport is USD$5 for a 24hr ticket. I walked quite a large part of it, but the hop-on, hop-off bus takes you easily to the hot spots. I met a few Chicago residents in my travels earlier, and they all said the food scene is one of Chicago's big feats. They weren't wrong: deep dish pizza is a must-try; Sweetgreen Gold was a delicious health food venue, and Raising Canes was a delicious less-healthy fried chicken venue. The live music scene is good, especially blues (check out Kingston Mines in Lincoln Park/Fullerton where they play live music till 4am!). I was in Chicago for 2 nights, which I unknowingly coincided with Lollapalooza 2025...

My views on Milwaukee are unique as I have family there. Backpacking there will undoubtedly be different to what I experienced. Regardless, its a very pretty area just over an hour north of Chicago. It sits on Lake Michigan as well, has a few breweries, and is close to Green Bay. I thoroughly enjoyed Lambeau Field as a very casual NFL fan. The tour is great, and watching the team do pre-season practice is both free and entertaining. Back in Milwaukee, I may have the accolade of being one of a few Aussies to attend the Wisconsin State Fair. Animals, unique food, beverages and amusements are aplenty. Try brat, cream puffs, deep fried cheese curd if you go! 

That's a wrap, hope this provides some insight, guidance or inspiration for would-be travellers to the Caribbean!

1mzqaun,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mzqaun/explore_if_the_oxo_brew_single_serve_pourover/,Explore if the OXO Brew Single Serve Pour-Over Coffee Maker Review Matches Expectations!,"I‚Äôve been using the OXO 11180100 Brew Single Serve Pour-Over Coffee Maker consistently for a couple of weeks now, and let me tell you‚Äîit‚Äôs been a delightful addition to my morning routine. As someone who has experimented with various coffee makers, this one is designed to simplify the pour-over process without sacrificing the quality of the brew. It‚Äôs especially appealing to me because it delivers a flavorful cup and keeps the mess to a minimum.

**Design and Build Quality**

The compact and lightweight construction immediately stands out. It fits perfectly on my limited countertop space and doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs crowding the area. The dimensions of 5.25"" x 5.25"" x 5.25"" make it an ideal size for someone who doesn‚Äôt want to invest in a large machine. What I particularly like is its minimalistic appearance; the white finish blends well with a modern kitchen aesthetic. Being dishwasher safe is such a lifesaver‚Äîafter brewing, cleanup is as easy as tossing it in with the rest of the dishes.

**Ease of Use**

As a pour-over enthusiast, I appreciate that this manual coffee maker makes the process approachable for beginners while still catering to those of us who are more experienced. The easy-read water measurement markings on the tank are incredibly handy. Even without my glasses on, I can fill the tank precisely to brew up to 12 ounces. The auto-drip tank ensures water is evenly distributed over the coffee grounds, consistently giving me a balanced cup. I also love that the lid doubles as a drip tray, which immediately elevates the convenience factor.

**Flavor and Performance**

If you‚Äôre into pour-over coffee, you probably obsess over the balance between flavor and aroma. I‚Äôve tried a variety of coffee beans with this brewer, and I‚Äôm pleased with the results every single time. Thanks to the precise water flow and heat-retaining lid, the flavors are robust, and the aromas are nuanced. I‚Äôve tested it while traveling and appreciated how effortlessly I could enjoy great coffee on the go‚Äîanother plus for those constantly on the move.

**Key Benefits**

- Auto-drip tank delivers consistent flow and balance.
- Compact size is ideal for small kitchens or workspaces.
- Dishwasher-friendly design minimizes cleaning hassles.

**Potential Flaws**

Not everything about this coffee maker has been perfect. It‚Äôs mostly catered to single servings, so it‚Äôs not ideal if you‚Äôre brewing for multiple people. I also found that while the reusable filter is eco-friendly, it can sometimes clog if the grind isn‚Äôt right. Lastly, the lack of insulation in the water tank means the coffee doesn‚Äôt remain piping hot for long.

- Limited to single-serve portions.
- Reusable filter could clog depending on grind size.
- Slightly inconsistent heat retention during brewing.

[Check OXO 11180100 Brew Single Serve Pour-Over Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b01enk41q6/)

**Rival Brands**

When I compare this coffee maker to popular competitors like the Hario V60 and Chemex Classic, a few things come to mind. The Hario V60, while delivering excellent clarity in flavor, lacks the convenience factor of the OXO unit‚Äôs auto-drip tank and mess-reducing lid. On the other end, the Chemex Classic does win in terms of design elegance and capacity for multiple servings but is bulkier and less suited for single servings. The OXO strikes a nice balance between ease of use and flavor consistency, making it more beginner-friendly than its competitors.

**True Value**

Considering its performance, features, and ease of cleaning, this coffee maker provides excellent value for money. It‚Äôs an affordable way to enjoy high-quality pour-over coffee without the steep learning curve that some other manual brewers demand. If you‚Äôre looking to simplify your coffee routine without breaking the bank, this is definitely worth considering. Plus, the inclusion of 10 unbleached filters is a sweet bonus to get you started.

I apologize I dont usually post on reddit and unsure how to update on my original post!

Anyways! I stopped by Euclid Coffee this weekend and boy was I surprised!.

Pros:
1) Staff is extremely friendly (seems like a mother/son duo so go support family businesses!!)
2) A lot of seating (counted about 34 seats)
3) Good amount of outlets
4) Spacious (almost like customers have like a separate room to hangout in)
5) Food and drinks came out fairly quickly (we were the only ones in there which was kinda upsetting)
6) Was delicious (we got the Kaya Toast, Avocado Toast, Butterfly Lychee, Matcha Latte, Euclid Latte)

Cons:
1) Quiet (i think because the customer area is almost a separate room, you cant hear the music they play so its pretty quiet)
2) Easy to miss (they dont have an official sign on their building. They only have a soft opening banner)
3) Restroom code (i mean i get it but sometimes an inconvenience)
4) Parking (they have a small parking lot. Have rear parking which is also small but im pretty sure thats for staff. Luckily they have a bigger plaza lot a little walks away. But they also have street parking)
5) No espresso hot drinks (i guess they are still waiting for their espresso machine to be approved by the city? Dont know how that works but they are currently making only iced espresso based drinks but replacing the espresso shot with cold brew concentrate. Flavor wise its still delicious. Can only imagine how it would taste with espresso)

Overall experience:
I would go again. As simple as that. Friendly staff. Nice cozy/private space for customers. They are still in their soft opening so they are also giving out 10% off on the entire order. Drinks and food is good. Its been hard to find a legit coffee shop that isnt just super trendy stuff near where I live and just having a place to hangout. A place that appreciates the fundamentals of coffee.

Please support small businesses!

I'm planning a 3‚Äì4 day solo trip to Goa and debating between staying in Anjuna/Vagator or Palolem.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm into:

Chill, scenic beach vibes (not into trance/EDM or big parties)

Sea swimming

Cafes with good music, food, and coffee

Open, interesting people‚Äîwould love to have a few good conversations

Maybe a touch of nightlife, but more on the mellow side


Not doing yoga or retreat stuff‚Äîjust want to unwind, explore a bit, and enjoy the beach without feeling isolated or overwhelmed.

1mzq28m,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechTactics/comments/1mzq28m/should_you_buy_the_best_asus_business_laptop_for/,Should You Buy the Best ASUS Business Laptop for Work Tasks,"Testing out the ASUS VivoBook Business Laptop has been an insightful experience. This particular model, the ASUS Business Laptop, boasts a mix of impressive features alongside a few quirks. As someone who relies heavily on laptops for both work and personal use, I put this machine through its paces over the past few weeks.

**Sleek and Lightweight Design**  
Carrying this laptop around was a breeze, as it weighs just 3.09 pounds and is remarkably slim at only 0.7 inches thick. Its Quiet Blue finish adds a touch of elegance, catching a few compliments when I used it at my local coffee shop. The 14-inch, Full HD display with a 1920x1080 resolution is sharp and vibrant, though I noticed the 250 nits brightness could feel a tad dim if you‚Äôre working in very bright conditions. That said, the thin bezels are a nice touch, giving a modern look while maximizing screen space.

**Winning Points**  
- The compact and lightweight structure makes it highly portable.  
- Quiet Blue design feels professional yet stylish.  
- Thin bezels enhance the overall viewing experience.

[Check ASUS Business Laptop price on Amazon.](https://metaversegenome.com/p/b0dtkv1frd/)

**Performance Under Pressure**  
This laptop's standout feature is its 12th Gen Intel i3-1215U 6-core processor. Having two performance cores and four efficient cores ensures processes run smoothly without unnecessary lag. It clocks up to 4.4 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Technology, and during testing, it handled my mix of Google Chrome tabs, Zoom calls, and some photo editing quite well. It‚Äôs a solid choice for multitasking, though you might notice it faltering slightly under very heavy, graphics-intensive tasks. Paired with an Intel UHD Graphics chip, daily browsing, and media streaming were seamless.

**Memory Overload**  
The 40GB DDR4 RAM is an absolute beast for its category. It's not often you find this level of memory in a machine catered to business users, and it kept everything running fast, even with numerous applications open simultaneously. The 1TB PCIe SSD storage adds plenty of room for large files, whether it‚Äôs video projects, presentations, or games. My coworker referred to it as unnecessarily spacious, but hey, better too much than not enough, right?

**Connectivity and Ports Galore**  
Connectivity on this model is excellent, thanks to MediaTek Wi-Fi 6E, which made my video conferencing experience far smoother than what I‚Äôm used to with older models. Bluetooth 5.3 is another bonus, improving pairing speed with my wireless headphones. On the physical side, you get 1 USB-C port, 2 USB 3.2 Type-A, and even an older USB 2.0 port, making it highly versatile depending on the peripherals you use. Adding HDMI support and an audio jack enhances its utility. However, I think they could‚Äôve squeezed in an SD card reader for photographers and videographers who frequently transfer data. That omission was a surprising miss.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The screen brightness can feel underwhelming in certain bright environments.  
- Lack of an SD card slot might inconvenience some users.  

**Battery Life Expectations**  
The 3-cell 42Wh battery claims to provide up to eight hours of usage, which held up reasonably well during my testing. While using it mainly for work tasks and occasional streaming, I managed around six to seven hours before needing to plug it in. It‚Äôs perfect for light daily usage, but if gaming or other power-intensive activities are in the mix, expect the battery life to dwindle more rapidly. Charging is decently quick, but I wish it had some form of adaptive charging to prolong battery health.

**Product Comparisons**  
Looking at competitors like HP‚Äôs Pavilion 14 series or Lenovo‚Äôs IdeaPad Slim models, this laptop holds up well in terms of processing power and memory. However, the ASUS VivoBook stands out with its massive 40GB RAM and 1TB storage, which are hard to find at this price point. On the flip side, some HP models offer touch-screen capabilities, which the VivoBook doesn‚Äôt, and Lenovo tends to have slightly better battery optimization. For a business-oriented laptop, the VivoBook excels but could broaden its appeal with these additions.

**True Value**  
Evaluating its price-to-quality ratio, this laptop feels like a worthy investment for professionals, students, or anyone needing a high-performance machine without delving into ultra-high-end options. You‚Äôre getting solid processing power, immense memory, ample storage, and a stylish design. In its segment, this device punches above its weight and is tailored for users who demand reliability and speed. While not the best fit for hardcore gaming or extensive creative tasks, it‚Äôs a powerhouse for work and general multitasking.

It's a Trailer founded by Believers that serves biblically themed drinks and it's so cute!

I got The Good Fight because I enjoy peanut butter and chocolate in my coffee. We also got a breakfast burrito with some good brisket inside from Big Mike's Q.

Not to mention there was a worship set that was played live in front of the church! The vibes were on point, the air was crisp, and it was a wonderful day!

This is actually an answered prayer of mine because I've prayed for the hearts of my fellow Believers to be stirred up to start some businesses here in Hampton Roads and beyond!

Since talking lessons I've expanded my range upwards a lot, since I used to not be able of doing anything above my break. On the lower end I can do as low as a D2 on chest (although it is quiet).

But as of lately (the past year) it seems like I have reached a usable limit around A#4 (like the one in hozier's too sweet, in the chorus when he says coffee) here anything upwards i can only sing in a really quiet voice that's really shaky, and that easily breaks if I try to add support to It, which I dont know if it's my head voice. (not taking falsetto into account of course).

The thing is, to reach those high notes I already take my voice ""through the nose"" and have to lower larynx, so I dont know if that's my mixed voice already and that's just as high as I can sing.

1mzpw3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mzpw3r/reveal_the_hidden_magic_of_best_pour_over_coffee/,Reveal the Hidden Magic of Best Pour Over Coffee Maker Hario V60,"Hario V60 Ceramic Coffee Dripper, Size 02, White has been a daily companion for my coffee-making adventures, and I‚Äôm here to break it all down for you. As someone who has a bit of an obsession with pour-over coffee, this ceramic coffee dripper stands out to me in so many ways. Hailing from Japan, this is not just another coffee maker‚Äîit‚Äôs a carefully designed piece of art with functionality at its core. Testing this product for a few weeks brought some solid insights about its strengths as well as a few points to note.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that strikes you about this dripper is its sleek, minimalist design and premium ceramic construction. It‚Äôs not just about aesthetics; the ceramic material is a thoughtful choice. It retains heat exceptionally well, ensuring a consistent brewing temperature for each cup. I‚Äôve noticed that this temperature retention directly impacts the flavor profile of the coffee, bringing out rich, nuanced notes. The white exterior finish feels timeless and adds a bright touch to my kitchen setup. It‚Äôs durable too, standing up to repeated use without showing stains or wear. The spiral ridges inside the cone are another plus. They aid in even coffee extraction, which is critical for that balanced flavor. My only gripe is that the ceramic material makes it a bit heavier compared to some metal or plastic drippers I‚Äôve used before, so you‚Äôll want to handle it with care.

**Brewing Performance**  
Pour-over coffee enthusiasts will appreciate the thoughtful design features that make brewing such a meticulous yet enjoyable process with this product. It‚Äôs all about control here. The single large hole at the bottom gives you complete control over the flow rate. Pour water quickly, and you get a lighter brew; go slower, and you‚Äôll pull those richer, deeper flavors. Personally, I tested this with different grind sizes and water temperatures, and there was noticeable versatility in the results. This dripper shines particularly well with coffees that have floral or fruity notes, accentuating those delicate flavors beautifully. However, it may not be the best choice for absolute beginners as using it well requires some practice.

[See Hario V60 Ceramic Coffee Dripper deals on Amazon now.](https://vendm.com/p/b000p4d5hg/)

**Ease of Use and Clean-Up**  
Using this dripper is pretty straightforward. Place your filter, add the ground coffee, and pour hot water in a spiral motion. But don‚Äôt rush‚Äîthis is as much an experience as it is a brewing method. The process promotes mindfulness, which is why I‚Äôve come to enjoy my morning coffee ritual even more. On lazy mornings, I‚Äôve also appreciated that cleaning it up is relatively fuss-free. Its dishwasher-safe feature makes life easier, although I usually hand wash it to preserve its ceramic finish. The only downside? Finding the right-sized paper filters might take a little effort, depending on where you live. But once you stock up, it‚Äôs smooth sailing.

**Positives**  
- Premium ceramic construction retains heat perfectly.  
- Minimalist, timeless design complements any kitchen style.  
- Spiral ridges enhance coffee extraction for a rich flavor profile.  
- Adjustable brewing control lets you customize the strength of your coffee.

**Negatives**  
- Slightly heavier than plastic or metal drippers.  
- Requires some practice for beginners to master pour-over techniques.  
- Limited compatibility with non-Hario filters.

**Other Options**  
In the world of pour-over coffee makers, the competition is stiff. Take the Chemex, for instance. Its glass construction and built-in paper filters offer a somewhat similar end result, but the Chemex lacks the precise pour control provided by the Hario V60 Ceramic Coffee Dripper. On the flip side, if you‚Äôre looking for something more beginner-friendly, the Kalita Wave might be a better starting point. With a flat-bottomed design, it‚Äôs more forgiving while still delivering excellent coffee. However, neither of these competitors brings the same artisanal flair and Japanese craftsmanship that the Hario V60 offers. That touch simply elevates it for coffee lovers who care about both form and function.

**Affordable Quality**  
When it comes to the value proposition, this coffee dripper holds up surprisingly well against other options in its category. Some might argue it‚Äôs priced slightly higher than plastic alternatives, but the quality of the ceramic makes it worth the investment over time. Plus, considering how reusable and durable it is, you won‚Äôt find yourself replacing this dripper anytime soon. The craftsmanship aligns with its price tag, striking an excellent price-to-quality ratio. Ultimately, it feels tailored for those passionate about artisanal brewing rather than those just looking for a quick caffeine fix.

*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

**Things i dont like:**  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

**My bad points:**  
*Over thinking, i have been called intense before, and i have a tendency to take things to heart.*

**Fun fact:**  
I was once called for jury service, and i would love to do it again. 

*I make no apologies for being who i am, the older i get, i seem to care less about what people think or say these days.

It was part of the Sunday's at the Chateau series and was about the kitchen since Stephanie bought the chateau (typically no mention of Nic being a co-owner at the time).   
Anyway, I had forgotten this particular vlog, but found it interesting to watch given the recent 'renovations'.  It was in the days when Stephanie presented things very well, not - in a frenzied manner - she's just sitting at the kitchen table, having a cup of tea and chatting with us.    
The 'old' range does feature, and it looked in as sorry state then, as it did before it's recent Blacking and Brasso session.  The (then) new range cost the earth too, and was going to be an item to last a lifetime!  I wonder what they are going to do with it now it has been removed from the kitchen.  It's probably rusting away in a barn area instead of being sold on or stored with potential use in one of the \[imagined\] apartment creations.

I don‚Äôt mind the job because I don‚Äôt have to deal with paperwork or anything very detail-oriented, and I usually have quite a lot of free time. That said, I get annoyed when there are too many customers and I can‚Äôt do my own thing.

In my free time, I like to spend time with my partner. If he‚Äôs at work, I enjoy going to the mall and indulging in the ‚Äúfiner things,‚Äù like getting a coffee, having a nice lunch, or buying cute clothes or makeup products. I don‚Äôt mind spending all my time with someone I‚Äôm comfortable with, but I wouldn‚Äôt want to spend time in a group. I do better in one-on-one interactions.

When I‚Äôm alone on the weekends, I tend to call my family a lot because I don‚Äôt like being alone with my thoughts. Too much alone time can lead me to overthink and stress about topics that already worry me.

I like walking and being outdoors, but I don‚Äôt enjoy sports much because I‚Äôm not very good at them. I‚Äôve always wanted to be artistic, especially at painting, but I feel like I lack imagination. I am quite good at singing, though, and as a child, I wanted to be a singer. I really appreciate songs that describe exactly how I feel; for me, the lyrics are sometimes more important than the music itself. Recently, I realized that I would need to work on my vocals and gain enough confidence to pursue singing as a career, and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm ready for that yet.

I tend to focus more on the present than the past. I have a friend who always brings up things from her past whenever I talk about something happening in the present, and it annoys me. She talks about people I‚Äôve never seen and will never see, events from ten years ago, and I often think, ‚ÄúOkay, but how is this relevant to us now?‚Äù I don‚Äôt mind thinking about the future a little, but I don‚Äôt plan too far ahead. I know some people like to have life goals mapped out, like getting married at 30 or buying a certain house, but I just don‚Äôt feel the need to plan that far in advance. I do consider the future impact of my actions, but I prefer to focus on the present.

I also don‚Äôt like to waste time. For example, when my partner and I plan to go to the mall, I‚Äôm ready to leave immediately, while he needs a lot of time to prepare, worries about forgetting something, and thinks about what to wear. That frustrates me because in my head, we‚Äôre ‚Äúgoing,‚Äù but in reality, we might leave an hour later. I admit I‚Äôm a bit impatient. When I take the bus somewhere, I tend to leave at the last possible moment because I hate waiting at the bus station. I do enjoy sitting on the bus, listening to music I like, and staring out the window tho lol.

I don‚Äôt spend much time on social media; I just use YouTube and Reddit and feel satisfied with that. I think social media can be fake and sometimes makes people less thoughtful or moral. I do fear being an outcast, but at the same time, I don‚Äôt want to be like everyone else. I feel like most people don‚Äôt consider things as deeply as I do or think about things in the same way.

My ideal life would involve spending time with my favorite person, doing all the fun things I‚Äôve always wanted to do, with someone who shares my values, understands me deeply, and maybe even takes care of me a little since I‚Äôm not that good at it myself.",1,1756126851.0,MbtiTypeMe,1,1.0,False

He works very hard to take care of our family. I am self employed and make enough money to have ‚Äúfun money) aside from our bills. I outright own TWO vehicles. One is the family 4 door 5 seater, big enough to comfortably transport my family all at once, and my pride and joy, my cyber green VW beetle with flowers and butterflies all over it. It is my FAVORITE possession. The fact that it is my most prized possession comes in later. The fact that BOTH vehicles are manual transmission due to personal preference and affordability will play in later too. Stick with me here, it‚Äôs a long-ish one. 

My aunt (70f) just moved from one state over to be closer to the rest of her family. 2 winters ago my sister (37f) had tires go flat at work and found out the next morning when her shift was over (she works 3rds). She called and woke me up and I jumped up (with only minimal grumbling and a ‚Äúyou owe me coffee‚Äù) and took care of her situation. $300 and 4 new tires later (out of mine and my husbands pockets, still yet to be replaced) the problem was fixed. A week later it was engine troubles and she got a check to junk it. I saw none of that money. Didn‚Äôt complain. Instead, since she lives 2.5 mi from her job and is fairly obese and looked like she was going to freak out at the thought of walking that far, I gave her my BEETLE, ya know, the prized possession. 1, because I require my family car on a regular basis to transport my whole family and 2, because I THOUGHT she would take care of it. A couple MONTHS later she calls me, luckily it‚Äôs Wisconsin so winter lasts like 6 months, to tell me that my car isn‚Äôt starting. 

Turns out when I told her the 1 major rule (oh yeah, I gave her only 1 rule, if the stereo stops let me know. My neighbor noticed a thing that I don‚Äôt understand and if the aftermarket stereo stops working it could be affecting the battery, again I don‚Äôt know anything about it I‚Äôm not car smart. The stereo was installed previous to my purchase), she ignored it and if it wasn‚Äôt winter could have BURNT MY CAR TO THE GRPUND! So I went over there, figured out the problem was that she ignored my stereo not working for over a week! It cost me a new battery. AND I had just installed new sleek black door handles and the passenger one WENT MISSING! She said ‚Äúoh that, yeah that was never there‚Äù. The f*** if it wasn‚Äôt! So I informed her that, as I told her when I leant it to her, if she disobeyed my 1 simple rule I was taking it back, and that‚Äôs what I was doing. After buying a new battery out of my pocket, I took my car back. MY WHOLE FAMILY CALLED ME OUT FOR BEING AN ASSHOLE FOR THAT ONE!! Might I add in at this point, she is splitting the rent with my aunt and they both work, my aunts one child is older than me, and my sister doesn‚Äôt have kids, I have 4 kids under 18 and me and my husband pay all our bills they‚Äôre not split with a roommate. 

My brother stays with us sometimes and helps us out here and there, but WE pay for our existence and our children‚Äôs existence and sometimes my brothers excessive eating habit. So we pay for a ton more than her. And I paid for the new tires on her van for her to junk it. And then paid for the repairs on my own car for damage she caused. I‚Äôll also take this time to mention that she is the only other person in the family that can drive a stick. The people who taught me are very sadly not with us anymore (RIP daddy and grandma!). That will be important later too. 

For those still with me buckle up because that is half the back story! My aunt that my sister lives with, she is, as I mentioned earlier elderly. Shes in her 70‚Äôs. One night my youngest (8f) had a febrile seizure. Not my first rodeo with those. I used to get them, and 2 other of my children have each had one before. My aunt (this is the next winter by the way, since I forgot to mention that I just let it all go with my sister and pretended nothing was wrong) slipped on the snow outside the same night. Since my aunt and my daughter were literally a freaking wall apart, yeah, my aunt was in the room attached to ours, I started going back and forth to make sure that she was ok since my sister called the ambulance and then WENT BACK TO BED!) to make sure that my aunt with a broken leg with the bone having broken through her leg causing severe bleeding was ok. 

To make things VERY clear, I knew my daughter was on the upswing, my husband was also there, I at NO POINT left my young daughter unattended with no idea to her condition. The hospital didn‚Äôt like me bouncing back and forth. I argued with them to let me take care of BOTH my family members to the point that they threatened to tase me and realized I wasn‚Äôt going to back down so they let me keep bouncing. I ALMOST GOT TASED BY SECURITY TO MAKE SURE THIS WOMAN WOULD BE ALRIGHT! I just got ridiculed for that. Apparently it would have been more appropriate to not care that she was alone and I could hear her crying THROUGH THE WALL!!! I‚Äôm still the a**hole here. 

But alas, if you‚Äôre still with me this is the back story. Now that you understand that here‚Äôs the real problem. A couple months ago I had an accident in my home while I was crafting and I sliced my RIGHT hand. Down to the bone on 2 fingers. Requires surgery and my RIGHT HAND being bound and unusable. BOTH MY VEHICLES ARE MANUAL TRANSMISSION AND MY RIGHT HAND IS BOUND! So I ask my sister who has since purchased her own vehicle again that happens to be automatic transmission ‚Äúhey, since you‚Äôre the only one who can drive a stick, even though you‚Äôve broken it before, if I give you my most prized possession again can I borrow your jeep until my hand is usable again‚Äù she says ‚Äúlet me think about it‚Äù. I personally feel like me offering her my prized possession is a clear sign that I won‚Äôt break her s*it because she could, in return, break my favorite thing. 

Oh! I‚Äôll also add in that the town I live in is about 250 people and has all of 2 businesses, a bar, and a post office. I HAVE to drive to get groceries for my kids. I HAVE to drive to get my kids to appointments in the next town over, I literally have no choice but to drive to get anything I need that‚Äôs not booze or mail. I called my aunt ‚Äúhey, can you please say a few nice things to my sister to remind her of all the times I‚Äôve been there for you guys. Remind her of how much I‚Äôve given to help her. I‚Äôm not asking because I want to drive her jeep, furthest thing from it, I am asking out of medical necessity. I can‚Äôt get to my appointments for my hand, I can‚Äôt get my kids food, I can‚Äôt get them or myself to where I need to go‚Äù. 

Oh! Also for those wondering, my husband has a phobia of driving. He literally can not. Do not sit here and tell me he should learn. He has tried. We have accepted he can not do it. So I do ALL the driving. My aunt informed me ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my place to tell your sister what to do or try to influence her on what to do with the vehicle she is paying for with her money‚Äù like ok, I get that but how f**king hard is it to say something nice about me. When my sister woke up she called me and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve thought about it and I really don‚Äôt feel like driving stock, you should have thought about the fact that you‚Äôre a klutz before you bought 2 stick shift vehicles‚Äù. When I called them out on fb (yes, I know not the best move, but I‚Äôm f**king hurt!) I got told I‚Äôm being a childish a**hole and I need to grow up and buy a ‚Äúlogical‚Äù car, and when I stood up to the bi**h that said that and told her to butt out she left the family when she divorced my cousin, she informed me ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been part of this family since before you were born, I‚Äôm more part of this family than you!‚Äù And instead of, I don‚Äôt know, realizing they hurt me and apologizing, for telling my cousins EXWIFE that she is not part of this family anymore, my aunt tells ME never talk to ‚ÄúHER‚Äù family again. 

This has pushed me to the point of almost suicide. Am I really the a**hole for being hurt that I am willing to make sure they are comfortable and cared for but they will let my children starve because I have no vehicle that o can drive at the moment? I‚Äôm still looking at 2 more surgeries on my hand and at least half a year of recovery because I popped the repairs that were made driving my cars when I wasn‚Äôt supposed to to get my kids food and to appointments etc. If I am the a**hole, please tell me how. Because now I have no family and no idea how I‚Äôm going to get my kids the things they need to survive. And if you wonder why moving into town is not an option, when our previous landlord wanted to sell our house, the apartment we‚Äôre in now was the ONLY one in a 50 mile radius when we were looking and inflation has hit everywhere else now so we‚Äôre locked in at a good price. Our location hasn‚Äôt been a problem until now. ",0,1756126733.0,AITAH,31,0.43,False

1mzppti,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1mzppti/tifu_by_disrespecting_a_friend_among_other_people/,TIFU by disrespecting a friend among other people and ruining the friendship,"So, obligatory this happened a few days ago. I still can't forgive myself, I don't think I ever will even if friendship magically comes back.

So I am 24M. And I met this girl, she is 24F, not last April but the April before that, so over 1 years ago. We met as a group, as the fans of a music genre. We met 2 days back to back, and I knew I would be head over heels for her if she didn't have a boyfriend and if we hang out 1-1. But there wasn't enough time to feel something, so I didn't think about her, my life was a mess anyways. I only saw her once in summer school, we chatted briefly. That's all. Later I realized she broke up with her boyfriend, but I still didn't care or think about making a move, I just realized went damn, and that was it.

After 2-3 months, near the end of last october, I replied to an instagram story of hers. That was the first time I replied to a non-friends story. She shared a song, and I loved that group back in the past. I said I love that group, then conversation continued, I genuinely didn't write to her in hopes of something. But it continued on, I learnt that she was graduatinf in this semester, so I said to myself ""Unlucky"". So I gave up pursuing her before catching feelings, thinking that it'd stop there, we would maybe talk in person couple of times, if I'm lucky I can even be somewhat friends with her? Because even from the limited conversation between us, I saw that she is probably the most interesting person I met, and we had lots of niche mutual interests. Personally she seemed amazing too. 

Then it escalated. I didn't expect that. Brief meetings in school turned to drinking coffee and in cafe. Coffees turned to studying together in library, then it turned to having dinner outside together, it turned to meeting nearly everyday in school, and then going to cinema, hanging out in the city for half a day (this happened 3 times, we spent 3 whole days each other, exactly 12 hours each). 

At the start, I didn't have any hopes. I really liked her but I was content with being her friend. Then she invited me to a dinner after meeting for breakfast earlier that day, and I suddenly I had hope. Then when it turned to daily meetings, then spending a whole day together, I had even more hope. I didn't make explicit moves, thinking that she would reciprocate my implicit moves if she felt similar. Why didn't I make concrete moves? Because I didn't want to lose her friendship for nothing. I thought, ""she'll leave the school in a  couple of months, I can handle this even if it doesnt progress that way, just dont ruin anything"" It was stupid to think like that. It ruined me, and in the end friendship.

By the way I'm saying implicit, but all my friends say that I was not that implicit. I agree, but she didn't understand it apparently. I learnt it when I confessed to her. I couldn't stand not knowing what she felt. After the semester ended, we met again. I went there completely defeated. I fully expected a usual ""I see you as friend"" talk. I planned to say all of this 1-2 hours before leaving. She started to talk about her traumas, and feelings. It was the first time I felt that she trusted me. I didn't know what to do. I was so determined to make that talk, but the vibe of that night wasn't it. I couldn't wait anymore, said it just before leaving. Then we talked for an hour. It wasn't an usual friendship talk. Then we met again one day after that. I said to her that I don't want to be in touch with her anymore, after she leaves the city to return to her hometown. 

It was sad for me that the way I handled that talk, but I was relieved I said what I said. Then after some time I realized that what she all said wasn't actually that usual? I got hope again. I thought maybe there could be a chance? I was sad that I didn't ask her like ""Can we date"" or something? I just said to her what I felt but there wasn't something she could respond to? By that time, I was on abroad, traveling, there was 3 weeks between our last meeting and the day I returned from that trip. I wanted to meet with her, we couldn't, then we had 2 phone calls that was horrible, and we mutually agreed we shouldn't keep in touch.

A month or so passed, and day after day I realized how bad I behaved. I didn't do anything directly disrespectful, because I respected her and she was an amazing person. But I realized how hurt she must've been about all that. In the end I couldn't resist and wrote her. We called each other and talked about how's life been. We kept in touch here and there after that, and I waited for months to meet with her and explain everything, and to apologize to her. 

We met in person in the middle of July. We talked a lot. I told her everything and I apologized to her. I said I will try to be friends with her, but the main reason I wanted to meet with her is because even though our paths may be seperated in the future, I want to reach out to her easily, and want to know if she's doing okay. I value her too much as a person. 

And then it was good. I was happy that I rekindled my friendship with her. But I realized quickly that it is not possible for me to be active friends with her, so I started to send her and tell her about things I found cool in text the moment I felt like. She had only one class to finish the school, she took a summer class. Look, I'm not naive or someone selfish. After all this, I decided that I shouldn't think for other people unless they show that they think like that, or say it. I told this to her. ""Please tell me if I say or something wrong"". I was asking to meet with her since she came back, the first time she said she had exam, second time she was sick, and finally the third time she said she didn't meet with anyone for weeks and she feels bothered by everyone trying to reach out to her. I understood that, and even though I felt sad, I told her I understand it. I texted her less.

My feelings for her was very manageable during these. I can understand when someone is not romantically interested in you. She didn't do anything to give me hope. A couple of weeks ago, after I again come back from a trip, I tried to reach out to her via text. Earlier this summer, when we first met after a long time, she said she was depressed for the last half of the year, and even thought about harming herself. The burden of cant finishing the school, you know? And living with her family and all that. I'm sensitive about this. So when I came back from the trip, since her 2nd exam went bad too, I texted her about hows it going. Then the night of that day. Then once the day after that. And then the morning after that, and she finally replied the night of that day. I know I was being too much, but I was anxious. She said we shouldn't be friends anymore. She said she feels like shes giving me hope. I convinced her to not do that. And I nearly stopped texting her for her, maybe once or twice in 1.5 weeks. 

Then that day came. The day everything is ruined. We both had exams that days. I wanted to see her, even if its just for 5-10 minutes. She invited me to hangout with her friend after the exam. I said why not? I knew the friend. I entered the exam and exited it, and wrote to her that I finished the exam. I went to the toilet, she didn't reply, like its been 15 minutes. I said okay and started to walk to the village, its like 15-20 minutes from the school but the road is not straight, it has ups and downs. I called her when I started the walking, she didn't respond. I walked for like 20 minutes, she still didn't respond. I was tired, hot, hungry, thirsty, I was dizzy. She invited me but couldn't bother to tell me where they sat or even look to her phone. After the last thing happened between us, I was kinda upset to her, because she tried to end the frienship without asking me, and assumed things about me. I felt that she saw me as naive because she thought I'd had hope. Anyways, then I thought about calling her friend, then I went to the place. Combined with feeling upset about that and the other thing, I was kinda angry. I said why do I even do this to myself. I arrived at the place. I thought we were gonna be 3 people including me. There were 5 people excluding me. I was thinking about properly greeting and sitting at the table, and then complain about it. But there were 5 people. So what I did do? God, I cannot believe it. I just went to the table with a face that look annoyed, and without greeting anyone, I looked at her and pointed my phone to her. Yeah, I know. That was the single worst thing I did to anyone. Then I sat at the table and greeted everyone. 

The day after the meeting, I texted to her. I knew I had no chance at meeting her. She said she doesnt want to see me. She doesnt want to stay friends. I wrote her mountains. I basically begged her to give me a chance to apologize and explain myself. She gave me a couple of cold replies that cut through me, mechanical replies. I deserve it. I cant stand all these ending this way, just because of a momentary failure. I begged her some more yesterday. I dont think she even read any of that. I'll give up for now. For a long time I guess. I hope I will have a chance to reconcile things for a bit. I'm so ashamed, I cant stop thinking about it.

TL;DR: I loved someone, we didn't become anything, then the communication ended. After months, we reconciled and became friends again, but I disrespected her in our last meeting by getting angry at her for not communicating about where they are, and with an irritated face I pointed her my phone without greeting her when there were 5 other people on the table. I am afraid that event ended everything between us.",0,1756126539.0,tifu,8,0.25,False

Hope your summer‚Äôs been survivable (with enough iced coffee to qualify as a food group). With work-from-home life rolling on and fall creeping in, I‚Äôm looking to connect with others in the poly community and talk to throughout the day‚Äî**primarily for friendship and good conversation.**  At the moment I'm poly saturated but definitely lacking in the friendship department within the community. If there‚Äôs chemistry beyond that,  then certainly open to more and something we can discuss down the line.

* Married for 19 years to my amazing wife, and also partnered with a wonderful NP for over a year (we‚Äôve all been friends forever‚Äîwholesome poly win)
* Based in Texas, work-from-home for a major film studio, and yes, I treat duty-free shops like an Olympic sport
* Cook like a pro, dance like a dad, awkward in the best way, flex like the microwave owes me rent
* Kink and 420 friendly

ü•ä **Stuff I‚Äôm into:**

* Nerd culture: LotR, Marvel, DC, Harry Potter, 90s cartoons‚Äîbring your fandom and let‚Äôs geek out
* Former boxer, current weight-lifter, still chasing meme-worthy gains
* Horror movies, 90s/00s nostalgia, and soundtracks that slap
* DIY projects: building, fixing, swearing, repeat
* Coffee (black, pumpkin spice, whatever gets me vertical), deep convos, and creating safe, inclusive spaces

üòÇ **What I bring to the table:**

* Dad jokes so bad they loop back around to good
* A judgment-free, empathetic ear
* Food pics + recipes (warning: may cause cravings)
* Consistent communication that‚Äôs thoughtful, not clingy
* Relentless encouragement to live your best damn life

**The hardest Things to cut out**

My Morning Coffee: I used to load it with flavored creamer, which is basically just sugar syrup. The first few days of black coffee were rough.

The Swap: Now I use a splash of unsweetened almond milk and a sprinkle of cinnamon. It‚Äôs creamy, tastes amazing, and has zero sugar.

""Healthy"" Snacks: My go-to was granola bars. I was shocked when I read the label and saw how much sugar was packed in there.

The Swap: A handful of almonds and an apple. It gives me actual energy instead of a sugar spike and crash.


Late-Night Cravings: My biggest weakness was a bowl of ice cream before bed.

The Swap: A bowl of Greek yogurt with some fresh berries. It satisfies the craving for something creamy and sweet without derailing my progress.

And I can't forget my Daily Meditation. When a craving hits, taking just a few minutes to breathe helps me realize I'm probably just stressed or bored, not actually hungry.

And here‚Äôs the thing that really hit me: it‚Äôs not just about the sugar itself, it‚Äôs about how much we‚Äôre being pushed toward it every single day. Advertisers know exactly how to wear us down. They design ads and packaging to hit us at our weakest moments, and it‚Äôs no coincidence that low-income neighborhoods and minorities are targeted more aggressively by companies like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and fast-food giants. It‚Äôs basically social engineering, nudging us into behaviors that keep the consumer machine running while wrecking our health.

We were once a species arguing because we were a shade darker or lighter than each other. We hated each other for being born a certain way. For trying to look different from our labels. For loving or not loving. That seems so stupid now.  



That changed after the event. An anomaly that we still don‚Äôt understand. I woke up that day, dreading going to work. I stayed in bed for a few more minutes than usual. I didn‚Äôt want to get up. I didn‚Äôt want to feel my back ache trying to stand. I didn‚Äôt want to skip breakfast and lunch just so I could afford to go to the doctor. I didn‚Äôt want to listen to Susan talk about how the‚Ä¶. What was it that she always complained about, some group causing all her problems. Man, they must have really hated her.  



I got up from bed and made my favourite brand of cheap coffee. It would be my only meal until dinner. I took the glorious first sip. I hoped to forget the bitterness. Mom threw all my sugar away, telling me to look after my weight. An unexpected feeling filled my mouth. It was a pleasant feeling, but it was slightly different from the sweetness, like feeling a completely different flavour, yet having the comfort and familiarity of eating a chocolate cake.  




That feeling woke me up from my drowsiness. Everything was different. Everything felt different. My usual white mug was now white with a hint of hotred. A shade, apparently in the infrared. I called it that because it was the colour of hot things and it feels adjacent to red, but not quite red. I can guess how hot something is by the shade of it.  



Then I noticed another pair of arms dangling underneath my arms. Something I definitely didn‚Äôt have before. I ran to the mirror to examine myself and saw a humanoid I have never seen before. My body was a glowing shade of cyan, with spots of royal blue. My face looked human, except for a dark tear-shaped stripe running sideways on my cheeks. I had four arms, that felt like I had had them my whole life. But I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúknow‚Äù how to move them. I was about the same size I was, maybe a bit healthier. I ran to my phone to open Reddit, to search for what was happening.  




There were thousands of posts about how people had changed. Some had shrunk to the size of mice. Some grew to the size of houses.  




Some who were awake saw a massive UFO, sending beams of light throughout the world. Then they witnessed their bodies change in real time. No pain nor panic. It was as if their bodies were always meant to be that. Some didn‚Äôt change at all.  




One person woke up scared of their tail, which also happened to be a snake.  




I looked at the multiple thick snake-like appendages hanging from my hair.  


‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt be snakes,‚Äù I remember praying to the aliens. Oh, how naive I was.

Notable gameplay mechanics: multiple choice endings, slightly meta narrative, choice of whether to use items eg drink coffee or take pills for hangover

Other details: the details i recall most clearly are; a vortex or portal opening near the middle or end of the game, a series of doors that can be opened or closed which affect the ending, an incinerator room, one ending has the character on an electric chair for murder of someone (his girlfriend iirc), one ending with waking up on a fishing boat. the things i remember less clearly are the animal that appears (again could be cat or rat or bird, but i believe mice are part of a puzzle), and the start is in the characters apartment and you can drink cold coffee or take pills before ending up in the puzzle ""realm"" or

**The backstory:**¬†During my internship at a HealthTech company, I had to manage firmware updates for a medicine distribution machine with 12+ ESP32 modules. Tools like ElegantOTA?

So we said screw it and built our own.

**What RoidOTA does differently:**

* **Batch updates**¬†\- Update 50+ devices with one click instead of babysitting each one
* **Device-specific firmware mapping**¬†\- Different devices, different firmware, no problem
* **Easy rollbacks**¬†\- Because sometimes updates go sideways
* **Fleet management**¬†\- Actually built for production use
* **Zero physical access**¬†\- Remote everything
* **100% open-source**¬†\- No paywalls, no restrictions

**Why this matters:**¬†As far as we can tell, this is the¬†**only**¬†open-source ESP device management platform available to the public. Everything else is either single-device focused or locked behind enterprise paywalls.

**What's next:**

* GitHub release in a few days (will post the link when it's live)

I (17f) might of slept with a possible Russian supremacist (18m) but I don‚Äôt know if I should go as fair as to call him that.

I am mixed (Indian and Ukrainian) and working class so I speak out about a lot of things like the Ukraine war, the rising hate towards immigrants in the uk, racism towards brown people, classism, and the fetishisation of races and ethnicities (from my experience being both Indian and Ukrainian). Because of that I always try and see where someone stands on these topics before becoming friends or partners with them.

A while ago I met a guy (18m) who was also mixed (English and Russian) and upper middle class. From what I could tell he had the same views as me on my focused issues so I thought he was ok.

We met up a couple days ago and went out, it was nice, he paid for my coffee and food we walked around, went to a gallery. He was easy to talk to, we made some jokes about how both his ethnicities oppressed my ethnicities, we talked about music and shows we liked. But he started saying some things that were a bit questionable to me: he casually mentioned that he was a sociopath, when I said I was applying for a job at Sainsbury‚Äôs and did work experience at a small art club helping children he said that he never realised how much he relied on nepotism until I said that (btw this guy has an apprenticeship in a very high up department in the uk government through family connections), he kept asking me about philosophical subjects and got a bit annoyed when I couldn‚Äôt give a proper answer as I said I don‚Äôt know too much about philosophy, and said that Ukraine getting back the 30% taken by Russia is unrealistic (Ik it probably won‚Äôt ever happen but you don‚Äôt say that to someone who just said their family were getting bombed) and asked what I realistically wanted to get out of that war which should of been my first red flags.

Things calmed down a bit and I stupidly agreed to sleep with him (I know i was stupid, I know it was a bad idea and I deeply regret it). It was going normally until he started saying shit that was a bit too xenophobic to ignore.

Here are some direct quotes of what he was saying because there was so much shit and I‚Äôm still processing everything:

- ‚Äúyou‚Äôre my little Ukrainian slut‚Äù

- ‚Äúyou like begging for Russian dick‚Äù

- ‚ÄúI bet if your Ukrainian family could see you they‚Äôd be so ashamed‚Äù

- ‚ÄúI‚Äôm superior to you‚Äù

- ‚ÄúUkrainian men would be lucky to have someone as pretty as you‚Äù

- ‚ÄúUkrainian men don‚Äôt deserve you‚Äù

- ‚ÄúRussia will always win against you, your people should just give up‚Äù

- ‚ÄúUkrainian women as pretty as you are reserved for men like me‚Äù

- ‚ÄúI bet you only went out with me because I had money, dirty Ukrainian bitch‚Äù

I was mortified, I was appalled, I was in shock. Because I was in shock and in disbelief I froze up and I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to say something. When he was done I just got my things and said I was going to go, he walked me to the train station and said he didn‚Äôt mean anything by what he was saying but not to tell anyone as it could ruin his future political career.

Now I don‚Äôt want to kink shame, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm crazy for thinking that was racist and xenophobic as fuck. Like you have to have some form of hate within you to bring yourself to say stuff like that unprompted, let alone get off from it. I know he said he didn‚Äôt mean what he was saying but it felt very well organised, to the point where I don‚Äôt think this came out of nowhere for him. So yeahhhhhh

I don‚Äôt want to call this guy a Russian supremacist if he‚Äôs not but it‚Äôs kind of not looking good for him.

Hello Everyone, 
Today is 75 days smoke free for me and I thought I should share this in case anyone out there may find it useful.

I went out of town to a Christian prayer and fasting centre where I fasted for 3 days, drinking only electrolytes with water + black tea & coffee.

I think the hunger made my brain forget about cigarettes. Who needs a smoke when we're starving, right?

I am not a Christian nor have I ever fasted before but this is the one that finally worked for me.

Wishing everyone the best. ",13,1756125853.0,stopsmoking,0,0.93,False

OTHER COMPANIES:

* RIVN - needham reiterates Buy on RIVN, PT 14. We reiterate our Buy rating ahead of Rivian's R2 launch, supported by end-market diligence and a consumer survey conducted in low EV penetration metros. The R2 is RIVN‚Äôs \~$50k ASP mid-size SUV, substantially expanding RIVN's TAM beyond the more expensive R1 vehicle. The size of the potential market opportunity for the R2 is encouraging when looking across current EV and ICE offerings at similar price points, and even more so versus modest consensus FY26 R2 delivery estimates.

* AEHR - said a major hyperscaler placed follow-on orders for six Sonoma ultra-high-power burn-in systems to test AI processors.The systems will ship over the next two quarters from Aehr‚Äôs Fremont, CA site.

* FN - JPM upgrades FN to Overweight from Neutral, raises PT to 345 from 318. We are upgrading shares of Fabrinet to Overweight (from Neutral prior), as the longer-term drivers for optical companies with leverage to multi-faceted investments, including in AI infrastructure both inside and around the datacenter, remain robust and intact, while the recent pull-back in the shares following the earnings report offers an attractive opportunity for investors to participate in the upside.

* VRNT - THoma Bravo is close to buying VRNT  in a deal valuing the call center software maker at about $2B including debt, per Bloomberg.
* VG - UBS upgrades to buy from neutral, PT 18. We believe the Street is underestimating the number of commissioning cargoes from Plaquemines. We estimate that number will come in around 600 vs. the company's guidance of 550.

I‚Äôm a freelance artist/designer. Recently I was dealing with a client who seemed to think I was their on-call intern‚Ä¶ except with no intern perks (like, I don‚Äôt know, learning opportunities or free coffee).

Here‚Äôs the highlight reel:
‚Ä¢	Every project = last-minute emergency. Like clockwork. Apparently I‚Äôm supposed to be psychic and know when they‚Äôll need edits at 11:28 AM.
‚Ä¢	Rates = pocket change. Honestly, the rates were so low I think even lemonade stands are offering better packages these days.
‚Ä¢	Payment history = sketchy. A couple of projects? Straight-up unpaid because the client ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt like the result.‚Äù Imagine ordering food, eating half, then telling the restaurant you‚Äôre not paying because it wasn‚Äôt Instagram-worthy.
‚Ä¢	Feedback = moving goalposts. Every time I fixed something, there was a new ‚ÄúOh, but also add XYZ.‚Äù By the end, it felt like I was playing Photoshop Whack-a-Mole.

This time, after multiple edit requests (beyond scope, obvs), I said: sure, but that‚Äôll cost extra. Client didn‚Äôt like that and hit me with a ‚ÄúI‚Äôll look for someone else next time.‚Äù

So I sent them the PSD file, told them I wouldn‚Äôt be doing further changes, and dropped some feedback about how they treat their artists. Their response? ‚ÄúVery unprofessional.‚Äù

My response? ‚ÄúOn your end, yes.‚Äù ‚ú®Mic drop‚ú®

Then I blocked them.

Now I‚Äôm sitting here wondering:
‚Ä¢	AITA for finally calling them out instead of just ghosting back?
‚Ä¢	Should I have just smiled, sent the PSD, and quietly walked away like a polite Victorian governess?
‚Ä¢	Or was it fair game to end things with a little sass after putting up with being underpaid, overworked, and occasionally unpaid?

So Reddit, am I the asshole, or just someone who finally grew a backbone?


‚∏ª

TL;DR: Client treated me like an on-call Photoshop intern with last-minute urgent edits, low pay, and unpaid projects. I finally told them I‚Äôm done, called out their behavior, dropped a mic, and blocked them. They called me ‚Äúunprofessional.‚Äù AITA?",2,1756125574.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

1mzpbem,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mzpbem/rf_wrote_a_short_story_based_on_my_experience_as/,[RF] Wrote a short story based on my experience as a professional gardener in the UK.,"The Curious Case of Charlie and The Omni-Directional Wind

There are men who wrestle lions, men who climb Everest, and men who cross oceans in tiny boats. And then there is Charlie, professional gardener and full-time chew toy of the atmosphere.

Every morning, Charlie straps on his leaf blower‚Äîa machine designed, allegedly, to move grass, hedge clippings, and leaves in one straightforward direction. A simple task. A reasonable expectation. Except Charlie is followed everywhere by omni-directional wind: a force of nature so pettily vindictive it feels less like weather and more like a cosmic prank that never gets old.

It doesn‚Äôt matter which garden he enters. The moment he pulls the trigger, whoosh. The air erupts into seventeen directions at once. North, south, diagonal, inward, outward, backward, and at least two trajectories best described as ‚Äúpersonal attacks.‚Äù I once saw a clump of grass blow east and west simultaneously. Isaac Newton would have had a nervous breakdown on the spot.

The weather forecast? Irrelevant. ‚ÄúCalm and sunny‚Äù is simply code for ‚Äúbrace yourself, Charlie.‚Äù Clouds gather on cue, like spectators settling into their seats. The Wind Committee cracks its knuckles. The match begins.

At first, it toys with him: a tuft of grass blown neatly into a flowerbed, a handful of hedge clippings that suddenly levitate skyward like they‚Äôre auditioning for Peter Pan. Charlie steadies himself, angles the blower, mutters, ‚ÄúNot today.‚Äù But then the finale hits. Piles scatter into neighbouring driveways, hedges instantly re-decorate themselves, and Mrs. Donnelly‚Äôs car receives a fresh, crunchy coat of foliage that looks suspiciously deliberate.

It doesn‚Äôt matter how he pivots. Every direction he turns, the wind is already there, waiting‚Äîlike an overly dramatic ex who has memorised his schedule and refuses to let him move on.

I once saw him enter a garden, march straight to the centre of the lawn, and spin in a slow circle with the blower, firing in every direction like some kind of gardening exorcist. The result? A perfect halo of grass clippings around him, like he was the patron saint of futility. If nothing else, it was visually impressive.

Charlie, bless him, does not surrender. He storms patios like a general, curses flying, while the omni-directional wind scoops them up and delivers them down the street to confuse passing schoolchildren. His hat has become a nomadic entity, last sighted in a Lidl car park three miles away. Yet he straps it back on each morning, determined to win the unwinnable.

Clients, naturally, are thrilled. They see their lawns tastefully ‚Äúdappled‚Äù with clippings, as if Charlie has invented a bold new gardening movement‚ÄîRustic Scatter Chic. They pay him cheerfully. Charlie accepts the money like a soldier accepting a folded flag.

And so the battle rages on. Day after day. Garden after garden. Charlie versus the wind. A gardener locked in eternal combat with an enemy no man,rake or leaf blower could ever conquer.

Legends are already forming. Children whisper of the man who fights the invisible giant. Old men nod solemnly when they see him trudging by, blower in hand, eyes haunted yet unbroken. Historians will one day write: There was a man who stood against the air itself. And he lost. Constantly. But by God, he showed up.

Tomorrow he will return to the field. Tomorrow the wind will meet him once again. And tomorrow, from my porch with my coffee, I will bear witness to the world‚Äôs most pointless epic.

‚ÄúGood luck, Charlie,‚Äù I‚Äôll whisper. ‚ÄúMay the breeze never run out of new ways to ruin you""

And then I hear it‚Äî a little voice, drifting from the kitchen window behind me:

‚ÄúMummy‚Ä¶ why is Daddy screaming at the sky?‚Äù

I take a slow sip of my coffee, watching my husband whirl around the lawn in circles, and smile.

‚ÄúBecause, darling,‚Äù I say, ‚Äúyour father thinks he can win.‚Äù

I think because we have lived together for so long, there are many times I should have left but didn‚Äôt. Now, I still can‚Äôt fathom not being with him. We have travelled the world together, lived in different cities together, made new friends together. And now, I feel as though he has no interest in me. All we do together now is grocery shop and watch tv together in the evening. He stopped kissing me 2 months ago. We haven‚Äôt had sex in over 8 months. However we still cuddle and do cute romantic things for each other. Like cook or make each other tea or coffee. But that‚Äôs about it. I feel as if I‚Äôve given up on trying to spend quality time together as I tried for so long. We have different bedrooms now and we‚Äôll usually watch an episode of a show together in one room and then he will go back to his bedroom for the rest of the night. He never invites me to hang out with friends. Even if they are friends that I introduced him to. He says things like ‚Äòyou wouldn‚Äôt like it‚Äô meanwhile his friends bring their girlfriends. His actions have started to annoy me more and more. His loudness in social situations. Or even just at home. His loud chewing and heavy breathing when he eats. The thing is no matter how much he annoys me I still can‚Äôt imagine what it is like without him? Nobody understands me like he does, even though we have drifted apart emotionally. I stopped opening up to him as he said in an argument that I was bringing his vibe down with my negativity (while I was working a really terrible job). He did mention the other week though that I don‚Äôt complain about work anymore (I got a new job and I also stopped talking to him about any negative feelings). He never opens up to me either. When we speak it‚Äôs very surface level unless it‚Äôs an argument. It‚Äôs hard to know if this is a rough patch, or just when to give up? I feel we haven‚Äôt been really in love for a long time now. I can‚Äôt imagine marrying him, but I could never imagine that? I just thought it was because I couldn‚Äôt imagine marrying anyone - but I‚Äôm not sure.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24‚Äì48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During¬†**plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to¬†track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your¬†**overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq)¬†via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what‚Äôs called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/wygr3l/bridgebuilder_in_the_unknown/) | [Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1mtivtx/bridgebuilder_chapter_150/)

The next morning arrived and Alex was a little less tired than usual. His apology to Zenshen had been met with good natured ribbing, which was what he had expected.

Dominic Crenshaw had also been amicable to getting an apology. Alex had come clean about how his reaction had been more about *his* past bad choices than what Crenshaw had said, and they had talked for a while afterwards. About Alex‚Äôs experiences with the Tsla‚Äôo, mostly. He had spent the most time around them, immersed in their culture. It was all stuff he had sent along in his reports to Section 7. The reports that had not made it to the Primer. He would probably be annoyed by that forever.

Crenshaw was less hesitant about trusting the Tsla‚Äôo than the first time they had met on McFadden station. Actually working with them had settled that.

It eased some tension that Alex had been hoarding all for himself.

Breakfast went as usual. He loitered after eating today, though. The Corvin was still inoperable, with its instrumentation still largely disassembled. There would be no further flight prep until that was resolved. Carbon had set the printers to work on the replacement parts overnight. Apparently the nose ribs were finished, but the length of the wiring harness Alex had removed and cut yesterday was taking its sweet time due to greater complexity.

That was fine. He still had something to do, there was a little timing involved. He sat in one of the booths in the mess by himself as people started to filter out. Scrolled on his tablet, drank his coffee, ate his donuts, and generally acted dejected because he was back to not doing anything but minding the Groundskeeper drone.

There were a couple of people left in the mess when Alex finished his donuts. He bundled up, grabbed a fresh coffee, said a quick goodbye, and cycled out the airlock. 

Then opened his comm up and set himself to patrolling. This was his life right now. He patrolled.

This was less a functional military patrol, and more like a security guard making sure nobody was trying to steal the dispenser out of the lunch room. It was, for all intents and purposes, doing laps around the base. Checking up on the Groundskeeper. Pretending he had some function here, because the drones they were supposed to have did this way better than he could, from a kilometer in the air.

It looked better than not logging in any sort of task while everyone else worked.

Alex set his coffee down in a snow bank and slipped on a pair of sunglasses, the false-sun of the Artifact aggressively bright this morning. Regular military issue ones, no fancy stuff built in except for impact resistance.

He tromped down the hill, the airlock to the mess cycling behind him. Abbot, Crenshaw, De Luca, Valena, and Zenshen were all heading over to the Command building.

It was the little things that made them immediately stand out from each other. Abbot in his anorak. De Luca had a macho streak so she didn‚Äôt wear a parka over a thick base layer. Crenshaw flew the Mars flag on his shoulder, pale blue over rust red. Valena was the only other Tsla‚Äôo in the mess, her hood down and silver-gray fur sparkling in the sun. Zenshen had taken to wearing a flag on her shoulder as well. Purple, red, and gold. That was not a standard thing the Tsla‚Äôo military did. 

He didn‚Äôt know where she had gotten that flag, or how it was attached.

They all packed into the Command building‚Äôs airlock, and that was that. Alex turned his attention back to the patrol. Lake: still frozen. Pathways: still frozen. Mind: preoccupied.

Carbon had scanned the thing he found on the wiring plug after dinner last night. Worked on it in their bunk until bedtime, poring over what she had found for several hours.

Her analysis of the extra circuitry on the wiring harness determined that it was a remote bypass. It had a *tiny* antenna so the range was limited - it would have to be accessed from inside the cabin, or just outside the cockpit. Once active, it would have control over everything the flight deck did, including comms so it could receive commands through the Corvin itself.

She had noted that the autonomous logic boards they had received ‚Äòon accident‚Äô were powerful enough to run an advanced drone once loaded with the right software, it would need an antenna to access the bypass - something that they had on hand in every wireless electronic device on the base.

The units were currently lacking any programming, so it wasn‚Äôt an issue. Carbon had also taken the liberty of filling all the ports on those boards with quickweld, rendering them impossible to use.

Alex sneezed and spilled coffee on his parka. His crisp white parka. ‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù He brushed it off, mostly making it worse. His gloves had coffee on them now too, and there were drips on the previously pristine walkway.

Well, that sucked but it was easily remedied. The depot was right there at the bottom of the hill and it had a bathroom. It would only take a minute to get this cleaned up with an actual towel.

He scuffed some snow over the spill on the path and headed down. 

Alex let himself in the pedestrian door, and remembered to clean his boots this time. Carbon had briefly complained about someone tracking boot prints all over her shop, and Alex was pretty sure that it had been him. Under different circumstances he would have kept that to himself and just minded that in the future. But they were dealing with people with nefarious intent here, so he had copped to it probably being his visit. Not someone else skulking around in there. That time, at least.

Carbon and Zheng were the only people there. Carbon was working on another pallet of supplies that had come through yesterday, wearing her armor. Zheng sitting at the workbench, tapping away at a keyboard. The printers were humming away at projects unknown, the matter compiler still building the wiring harness.


‚ÄúMorning!‚Äù He announced, as no one had really looked up from what they were doing when he walked in.

Zheng waved over her shoulder.

‚ÄúHello.‚Äù Carbon hefted a crate about half the size of her body off the pallet and carefully walked it into the secure cage, glancing over him quickly. ‚ÄúWhat did you do to yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúCoffee attacked me.‚Äù He finished the cup and tossed it into the recycler by the door. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I won.‚Äù

The cage door closed behind her. ‚ÄúSo I see.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust stopping by to clean up, really. So, you know.‚Äù He headed back to the bathroom, a very compact affair crammed into the corner of the building.

‚ÄúDo not let me stop you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt.‚Äù Just normal coworker banter. Probably. His last batch of ‚Äòcoworkers‚Äô that he hadn‚Äôt ended up in love with had been other Scoutship pilots. Which were not a normal group by any means. Had Carbon ever had coworkers *at all* before now? By his understanding, the command staff on the ship she was deployed to as a Lan were the closest thing to such, which, again. Not a normal group.

They were going to screw up so bad if they ever faced any sort of scrutiny to keep this charade afloat.

Flip side of that, of course, was that if someone was preparing to make weapons here, there was a reasonable chance they knew about that relationship. Maybe not the full details of it, but the Civilian Pilot Program had seen the black box data from the *Kshlav‚Äôo* as well as the ONI. The Navy knew. The thought had crossed his mind that they would make great collateral for use against Eleya. Well, Carbon would. He‚Äôd only be there to keep Carbon in line, but given Carbon‚Äôs reaction to Eleya being shitty, that would not work out in new and exciting ways for their plant.

But there was a silver lining here. A little water and a paper towel was all it took to get his clothes clean again. It was the closest he could get to a silver lining right now. Alex had never really considered himself particularly fastidious when it came to his clothing. Scuffs and such just added a worn-in patina. But that blotch running down the crisp white front of his jacket had annoyed him.

Alex really had to try out the other color settings on his parka. He paid for the color change feature, he should use it.

Carbon was waiting for him when he stepped out of the bathroom. ‚ÄúCould I ask you a favor, Pilot?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, of course. What‚Äôs up?‚Äù

She smiled and gestured over to a stack of plastic containers on the workbench. ‚ÄúThe nose ribs for the Corvin finished fabricating this morning, do you suppose you could take them up to the hangar for me?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôm headed up past it anyway.‚Äù He grabbed them up and stuffed them into one of the big cargo pockets on his parka, surprised at how compact they were. The Corvin‚Äôs wings weren‚Äôt particularly thick, though. ‚ÄúAll clear of microfractures, I presume?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, both Zheng and I checked independently.‚Äù Carbon nodded, watching him cram dozens of hours of work into his pocket like a handful of snacks. She looked up to meet his gaze and she continued, in a slightly sweeter tone, ‚Äúif it is not too much to ask, could you also take some of my tools with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see why not.‚Äù He knew she was going to ask that.

All of this had been planned to get him in here to take that tool box up in a manner that appeared organic. The moody hanging around the mess, the ‚Äòpatrolling‚Äô, spilling the coffee... It was assumed that their plant, or plants, would have access to the security cameras and drone feeds. Some of them could be avoided, some of them couldn‚Äôt.

When they went looking for these parts, the locations should be unknowable. No matter how much searching they did.

Which is why, when Carbon led him over to the secure cage and grabbed a big toolbox for him to take, it had already been loaded with a bunch of stuff they wanted to make disappear. Off camera.

‚ÄúHere you go.‚Äù She held the black polymer toolbox out like it was weightless, thanks to the strength boost from her armor.

He lifted it from her grasp and nearly dropped it. He had expected it to be heavy, sure, but not *that* heavy. ‚ÄúWow. Suppose you will be taking a spaceship apart.‚Äù Alex laughed, wincing internally at how nervous that sounded.

‚ÄúI will be, yes.‚Äù Carbon said, pleasantly.

‚ÄúWell, I should get back to it. I‚Äôll see you guys at lunch?‚Äù He pulled his hood up and shuffled awkwardly to the door, adapting to the weight of the toolbox as he went. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt have too much fun.‚Äù

Zheng didn‚Äôt look up from her work, waving over her shoulder. ‚ÄúSee you later.‚Äù

Carbon waved. He caught the heavy weight of sadness collapsing into her eyes just before he stepped outside.

Alex assumed this entire thing was more difficult for her. They had gotten used to each other and fell into a comfortable groove over the last few months. Now they got to play pretend at being friends, at best. They were doing all right at that in public and very bad at that in private. 

He didn‚Äôt like it, but he had experience with having romantic relationships come and go before. Not that Alex had been very good at them, but it gave him a foundation of that sort of loss to build from, to be comfortable with. Carbon didn‚Äôt have that. She didn‚Äôt even have *friends* that hadn‚Äôt been given to her.

That was what burned through his mind as he trudged up the hill to the hangar. She was a grown woman, more than capable of taking care of herself. He shouldn‚Äôt feel so defensive of her... But he did. Alex knew how defensive of him she was. He had been there when it boiled over. 

Soon he was back in the *Hokule‚Äôa*, filling the seats with more parts and a big box of tools. He closed the door - the hangar was cold. While the shuttle‚Äôs main power couldn‚Äôt be turned on, the life support was on its own redundant link and keeping the temperature inside at a much more survivable 23 degrees. Practically balmy after months on Tsla‚Äôo ships.

The top trays of the toolbox actually contained tools. Shiny, new, about half of what Carbon would need to open up the wing. Conveniently, these were more than enough for him to open interior body panels the onboard tool kit couldn‚Äôt. There were only three people that should have access to these once they were back in the cage, as well, minimizing the number of avenues 

Beneath that, where one would normally expect to find larger tools, were the more concerning goodies that got sent over. He picked up what looked like a dark gray IV bag, swollen with what they were considering contraband. Beryllium colloid, one liter. Two more remained in the box. All five of the quickweld sealed logic boards were in there as well, and a can of spray foam to keep things from rattling around.

The meeting with Admiral Serrat was still on for this afternoon. Carbon and Williams had been triangulating on how they were going to approach these findings over dinner last night, dining in the Command building under the guise of planning the expedition‚Äôs first visit to the holographic map in the grove. Feel out Serrat‚Äôs responses to determine if he was aware of what was going on, and if it seemed appropriate to do so based on his reactions, request that all of this stuff get sent back through for a thorough investigation. Or at least safe disposal.

No one was supposed to be using the portal without express permission, and that included hurling suspicious items through it.

So this may have been for nothing. Alex might find himself back up here after dinner tonight taking the overhead bin apart again to get at the nook that he was about to seal those logic boards into.

Time would tell.

I genuinely love supporting her so much and I'm always trying to think of new ways to help them in her journey even if it's small.

Anyways, she's the sweetest, most resilient person I know and I KNOW she will do well this semester and in all her future semesters and I'll always be alongside of her successes and failures (academic, personal, and what not).

I know they'll achieve their ultimate career goal as well, they want to work in the animal healthcare field. She'll definitely beat and own those pre-reqs and her future classes + applications, nothing will stop her from succeeding! I can't wait to see how much she grows, and she's growing so much already.

We have recently launched a product that can be potentially used by every person on Earth, and every company on Earth. And the timing could not be better!

[https://mcp-cloud.io/](https://mcp-cloud.io/)

# I know what you think: yet another AI startup... ü•±

***And what a heck is this MCP thing???***¬†üßê

*I totally get your scepticism - the AI space is¬†flooded¬†with buzzwords, and sometimes it feels like we're just adding more layers of complexity to problems that don‚Äôt even exist, right? Like,*¬†***do we really need our chatbot to order pizza?***

But let me try to break it down in a more personal, practical way‚Äîbecause you're right, today‚Äôs MCP servers are still in their infancy. They're a bit like the early App Store: lots of simple, fun, but not-yet-life-changing tools. But the¬†***potential***¬†is where the things will get truly exciting.

***Imagine this:***

You wake up. You grab coffee, you open your MCP-powered chatbot (let‚Äôs assume it‚Äôs hooked up to¬†**the remote MCP)**. Instead of jumping between 10+ tabs (Jira, Slack, Notion, your CRM, ERP, Google Calendar, GitHub, that internal wiki nobody can ever find‚Ä¶), you just type:

>*‚ÄúHey, can you summarize my top priorities for today? Pull my Jira tickets, check for pending PRs in GitHub, check Slack messages where I am tagged and suggest answers, etc.‚Äù*

In seconds, you get a clean, context-aware summary. No app switching. No digging. Just‚Ä¶ done.  
Then later:

>‚ÄúCan you draft a response to the client‚Äôs last email based on the proposal doc in Notion and also check our data warehouse for the Q3 metrics they asked about?‚Äù

**Boom. Done.**¬†You only need to review, make correction and approve. You won't even need to open Jira, Slack, Github, Salesforce to make an action - everything is done by AI agent (your LLM Client App) with the help of connected MCP servers.

>‚ÄúCreate a subtask in Jira for the API bug Juan mentioned in yesterday‚Äôs standup‚Äîand notify the team in Slack.‚Äù

You didn‚Äôt touch a single app. You didn‚Äôt even leave your chat....

***And even something completely crazy: you do all of these by just speaking to an AI assistant why riding a bicycle to your office.***

# How is it possible at all? üßê

**Meet MCP!**

MCP stands for¬†**Model Context Protocol**¬†‚Äî a new standard that lets AI models like ChatGPT connect to¬†**external tools, APIs, and data sources**¬†in real time.

**MCP**¬†is Like¬†**USB-C for ChatGPT**. One common plug to safely connects ChatGPT to¬†*any tool or data, any website, cloud application, service*.... anything! Need to order pizza? Schedule a ride home? Send email, pay for grocery, rent a car, buy a flight ticket, submit tax declaration, send flowers with a gift card to your sweethart - all done by chatting with ChatGPT!

# Have you heard that ChatGPT already supports Remote MCP connections?!

You probably haven't noticed it yet, because it is only supported for¬†**Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu plan**¬†only. It‚Äôs not yet for everyone, but the signs are clear: this is coming to all users soon, and it will be a¬†**game changer**.

# But what is the business opportunity here? ü§î

>***To use all of these services from any device (including your IPhone) you need to connect it to an MCP Server***

**And here is a CATCH:**

Here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ MCP isn‚Äôt just something you¬†*download*.  
You actually have to¬†**run**¬†it somewhere (in a server in your basement or in cloud).

*And unless you have:*

* *A PhD in Computer Science*
* *10+ years of software development under your belt*
* *Or a license in certified¬†black magic programming*

# Enter: MCP Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è‚ú®

We are building¬†[MCP Cloud](https://mcp-cloud.io/)¬†is here to save the day!

**MCP Cloud is a new Platform that will help you to:**

* Run MCP tools without setting up scary servers
* Share them with other people instantly
* Even make a little money if you want to offer your tool to others

*When Remote MCP becomes available to all ChatGPT users, you won‚Äôt need to know how it works under the hood ‚Äî you‚Äôll just click ‚Äúconnect‚Äù and boom: ChatGPT can use your favorite tool, fetch your data, or automate your work.*

**Why will every person need Remote MCP?**

It is dead obvious: today you use your LLM Client on MacBook Pro. But tomorrow you will use LLM Client (with voice) on your IPhone.

**Why will every company needs Remote MCP?**

It is dead obvious too! Managing infrastructure of your own MCPs with OAuth, personal access tokens for multiple users to manage access to the same MCP servers, setting up SSO, security, https, containerization, isolation, IP witelisting .... and doing it FAST - is a hassle. And the lost time efficient business cannot allow itself to loose. Better to use 3rd party service.

# Where do we stand now

We are a small team working relentlessly on the¬†[MCP Cloud](https://mcp-cloud.io/). Our¬†**Beta release**¬†has happened only a few days ago,¬†***but we already serve our first users!!!***

We are actively testing and improving our yet small platform.

***Happy to hear any feedbak, thoughts, ideas. Let's start a discussion. I‚Äôm especially keen on feedback from founders/ops/PMs who‚Äôve tried to roll AI beyond a single champion. Thanks!***

Seems like all the threads in this channel are old as hell as I just visited a small shop called Tarquin's (I think that's how it's spelled) in Netley (Near the abbey) and I don't see it mentioned anywhere on here. I ahve to say that it is hands down the best coffee I've tried so far in Southampton.  
  
I also tried some others mentioned in other threads but I don't want to poo poo them here as I only want to talk about good coffee and I'm curious what recommendations others have.

Some criteria I have... it should be an actual independent shop (Not a chain) and have specialty coffee as defined by the Specialty Coffee Association. I can check that though.",2,1756124576.0,Southampton,5,1.0,False

1mzoy07,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeneathTheMasks/comments/1mzoy07/my_passion_cacao/,My passion: Cacao,"I'm quite new here and thought to share how I experience cacao once a week.  Because for me, it‚Äôs more than a drink: it‚Äôs a way to slow down, connect with nature, and reflect.



On my ritual day, I eat nothing and only drink water before preparing the cacao. I grind cacao nibs (or beans) by hand and the process itself is meditative. I usually let the nibs sunbathe before grinding as it tends to make it easier. During the colder months I have to put them on a heater or into the sauna when it's cooling down but is still warm enough. I do it outside in the sun when I can, or near a window where I can watch the world outside. This preparation helps me set an intention, focus, and really connect with the plant. I can only work with a mortar at the moment (waiting for my metate to arrive) so it usually takes around 4-5hours. I know I sound crazy but I guess that's what a deep passion does to a lot of people. 



I usually prepare around 40‚Äì45g of cacao for two people, and sometimes add a touch of chili, but nothing else. Then I pour the cacao into a pot with water around 70‚Äì80¬∞C, and pour it back and forth between pot and cup to make it creamy. I do not call it hot chocolate as I see hot chocolate as another thing entirely. The gap between cacao like this and hot chocolate is as far as Ethiopian coffee is to a vanilla latte. I also don‚Äôt use a blender or other shortcuts like some ‚Äúceremony‚Äù videos I‚Äôve seen.   
Modern shortcuts would take this ritualistic aspect away for me and how I want to experience it.   
Before drinking, I pour a small sip onto the earth as a gesture of respect towards the culture it actually comes from. 



Drinking cacao this way feels grounding, warm, and opens me to reflection. I feel calmer, more connected, and it often helps me process my emotions. Which is a blessing when you're autistic and usually struggle with these things. 

  
Well, that's it for now I guess. I might go into it deeper at some point but I'm just here testing the waters.   
Talking about cacao like this usually ends up with dismissive comments. I know this might seem unusual to some, but I hope I can spark some curiosity and reflection.
