A visual of the neighborhood, if you take square and divide it in 4 equal parts A B on top and CD underneath. Our home is D. The neighbors we are having an issue with is A. There are 12-foot-high bushes between our yard and B and encroach a bit into A's yard and about 125' of land between our porch and Neighbor A's sunroom. I have to leave my screen porch and walk to the left about 10' and back 10' to see into A's yard (barely).

We are the original owners. We build the house 33 years ago. We saved for 10 years to add a screen porch. We love having coffee in the morning and dinner in the evening outside.

Neighbor A's father was the original owner. He got sick about 25 years ago. His 3 single daughters all moved in to care for him, and they all stayed. The sisters are all in their 70's early 80's., all never married. Only 2 are still alive; the father & 1 sister died.

In 33 years, I have never met any of these people. I literally would not know them if I fell over them. They never go outside. To my knowledge until about 2 months ago, they never used their sunroom. I don't believe the windows were ever opened.

About 45 days ago a guy showed up, the gossip is he is one of the sister's boyfriends.  I don't know anything about him except he goes to the sunroom & opens the windows and smokes one cigarette after another from 5:30am- 7:30am. Leaves and returns around 1PM and smoke from 1pm -2pm returns and smokes from 8pm-10pm.

I don't give a damn about the smoking. What I care about the loud hacking, coughing, phlegm producing, splitting, & gagging that is literally none-stop between drags from the cigarette. It is so loud and so disgusting that we can't sit outside. I start gagging. Last week we had friends over for dinner and after a few minutes our friend said, ""I am so sorry, but can we please go inside, I can't eat listening to this""

I believe, if this behavior is to the point where sister's boyfriend is stopping us from enjoying our outside, then I can say something. I want to send them a note and ask them to please move their new smoking roommate to the garage or front porch. (they have a front porch too that is on a moderately busy street). Our neighbors in house C, who also smoke, just moved themselves to the front yard. She thinks I should let it be that the 80-year-old lady finally found a BF. I don't care about the BF. I care about the disgusting respiratory issues.

AITJ if I send the letter to the sister's asking them to move the smoking roommate to the front porch?  Thank you.",1,1759529428.0,AmITheJerk,0,1.0,False

But it never happened.

Even now I never feel tired and the only way I can fall asleep is to just wait. 
As in, I only have sporadic, very short periods of time, as in a minute at most, during which I can suddenly drop.
I can fight it, but once I do the chance is gone and I have to wait at least another few hours for the next one to arrive.

There are phases during which these points start occurre more regularly, usually 16-20h after waking up, so as long as I lay in bed during that time I can catch one and sleep for 4-6h.

But there are also phases like now during which I have been been awake for 40h and still feel like I woke up an hour and just finished a big cup of coffee.

Believe me, I laid in bed for 8h last night, with nothing but quiet music and I just couldn't get the energy down. I even spend over an hour walking in circles in my room in hope that it would help but it didn't.

I just wanna know if books lied to me and being tired is literally just noticing that your brains processing speed has slowed down  and how people lay down and just pass out within like 30min.

I tried rituals, no electronics an hour before I attempt to sleep, meditation etc. I have not yet found a healthy method that makes me fall asleep",0,1759529172.0,NoStupidQuestions,0,0.5,False

Recently my husband got a huge set of DMs from a woman I don’t know. For context, I dated her current boyfriend about 10 years ago. It was a short relationship, maybe 10 months, and we have had no contact ever since. I’m married now and my Instagram is just normal lifestyle and aesthetic posts.

This woman sent my husband a long rant accusing me of secretly sending signals to her boyfriend through my posts. She claims my posts are making him spiral, keeping them awake at night, and confusing their relationship.

Some of the “hints” she thinks I’m dropping:
	•	I posted a sunset photo and she said it was because sunsets are meaningful to him
	•	I posted a book and she said it was because he likes literature and I was trying to connect with him
	•	I shared a coffee photo and she said it was because he drinks black coffee and I was taunting her
	•	I shared a plant photo and she messaged my husband saying “Adrian and I are both plant lovers. Your wife is dropping hints she wants him back”

Here is a direct excerpt from her actual message so you can see how it sounds:

“Your wife is perfectly aware of the pain she is causing all of us here. Please be kind enough to talk to her. She is dropping hints about wanting Adrian behind your back. It is really unfair. Her posts are making him recall bad memories and it is one of the reasons we cannot sleep at night.”

It goes on like this for pages. She even corrected herself mid-message to say “Mrs.” instead of “Ms.” when talking about me, just to point out that I am married.

I don’t know how to handle this. I haven’t spoken to this guy in a decade. My Instagram posts are just aesthetic and personal, nothing directed at anyone.

Would you ignore and block her completely? Should I reply once to shut it down? Has anyone else dealt with someone projecting their own relationship problems onto you like this?

TL;DR: I’m 34F, my husband is 35M. My husband got a long rant from a woman accusing me of sending “hints” to her boyfriend through my Instagram posts. The guy is my ex from 10 years ago. I haven’t spoken to him since, but she’s projecting her relationship issues onto me.",1,1759529085.0,relationships,2,0.67,False

**--- Across the Rubicon ---**

 

A man sits at a pub with a deck of cards. He is joined by a younger man and a woman, neither of which can ignore his unpleasant odor. This 40-something wretch with a receding hairline didn’t have the look of someone important, but as with many things, looks could be deceiving. For all his inconsistencies and flaws, this man was Lloyd, also known as ‘Galapagos’, and he was their one connection to a world most people would never hear about.

Lloyd shuffled a deck of cards with a practiced hand. Over, under, through, backwards; he had complete control. They figured he could pull some really cool tricks if he wanted to. He seemed like the type.

“Imagine our world as a deck of cards,” he said. “There are so many ways it can be shuffled and played. Fifty-two cards, that’s a fifty-two-factorial. That’s a sixty-eight-digit number. You with me?”

Perry was a scrawny guy in his twenties. His side-parted rat-blonde hair might give the impression of a Catholic prude; quite the opposite of his very private search history.

“Sure, big number,” said Perry. “I get it.”

“*Really* big number,” added Lloyd. “But it’s still a number. It has an end. Our world works the same way. It’s like a game that can be played over and over and over again, until you run out of cards and ways to play them. And we ran out of it long ago.”

Tamara rolled her eyes. She wasn’t a fan of this metaphysical crap, but she had no choice but to believe it. She’d seen it with her own brown eyes. She’d lost people to it. Good people.

She tied her frizzy hair into a bun but kept getting that one strand of hair poking at her nose. Tamara was hesitant about showing her face in public, given the circumstances, but she didn’t have much choice. Lloyd wouldn’t have approached unless he could clearly recognize them. He continued to speak, shuffling his deck as he went along.

“So what happens when the games run out? Well, the deck shuffles, and we go again. But now we gotta break the rules to get new combinations. Some cards are shuffled backwards. Some are drawn twice in a row. We might see completely new cards taken from different decks. But see, this? This destroys the *integrity* of the deck, it was just *meant* for fifty-two cards. The players won’t like that.”

“So what happens when the game breaks?” Tamara asked. “We fold, everyone goes home?”

“Pretty much,” Lloyd nodded. “They get up from the table and play a different game. Together.”

 

A waitress dropped off a plate of cheese-stuffed chilies. Lloyd hadn’t eaten in two days, but he didn’t mind the gastrointestinal Armageddon this would bring; he needed calories. Perry was nonplussed; he could make a better side dish with some water chestnuts and good ol’ fashion bacon. Maybe a splash of honey.

“So we’re screwed,” Tamara said. “That’s all there’s to it then.”

“Sort of,” said Lloyd, stuffing his face. “There are some working theories. Hatchet’s been working on something.”

“Of course they have,” said Perry. “When are they not trying to screw people over?”

“They figure that, if you *kill* the player, they can’t finish the game,” Lloyd continued. “They’ve been working on something big. Reassigned a third of their global workforce to this one project. We’re talking a budget equal to the GDP of several nations.”

“Kill the player?” Perry scoffed. “Won’t that just kill everyone? Or is it like a Nietzschean ‘we killed God’ kind of thing?”

“No, it’s very real. And we don’t know for sure what’s gonna happen, but we figure the game will, at least, not end.”

“It’ll just stall then,” said Tamara. “Nothing new to play.”

“Yeah, I’m not about that,” said Lloyd, shaking his head. “I think that’s the worst kind of hell. Some kind of timeless stasis.”

Perry waited patiently for Lloyd to finish his chilies. The waitress came back around with a couple of beers. The conversation picked up as she left.

“So we gotta consider our options. I’ve gone over this a hundred times, but I wanna hear your thoughts. What can we do? How do you save the game?”

“We get a new player,” said Tamara. “Someone who hasn’t played before.”

“Doesn’t matter,” said Lloyd. “All cards have been played. It’s done. Doesn’t matter who holds the deck. What else?”

“Play a different game,” said Perry. “Get some dice. Play Yahtzee.”

“Ah, but our world is a deck of cards. Changing the game removes us from the equation, and we don’t want that. Next.”

“This just sounds like a drawn-out way of saying we’re fucked, still,” said Tamara. “You’re not making a good case.”

Lloyd shrugged, popping another chili and downing it with five long gulps of his beer.

“Let me spell it out for you then,” he said. “Some want to kill the player. Some want to take their place. Some want to burn the deck and piss on the ashes. And as far as I know, the only thing we can do is hope the player sticks around for a couple more rounds.”

 

Lloyd ordered in a plate of nachos and a BLT. They had a couple of drinks and let the December night lull into the late hours. Lloyd showed them the rules of gin rummy as they discussed their various ideas. Perry was half-asleep, yawning in and out of whatever awareness he could muster. Tamara soldiered on as Lloyd prepared himself for a round of solitaire.

“How do we *know* the game is breaking?” Tamara asked. “I mean… maybe this is normal?”

“Life,” Lloyd said, putting down an ace of hearts. “It’s the first broken rule. There isn’t *meant* to be life. Just look at the planets around us, no life anywhere.”

“Is there supposed to be?”

“There used to be. Life is a symptom. And intelligent life is the terminal stage.”

“So this is a pattern?”

“Yeah,” he nodded. “From what we understand, every single planet in our solar system has gone through the same cycle. And when any kind of life gets into the picture, everything goes to shit.”

He put down a two of hearts, pushing an empty plate to the side. Tamara couldn’t help but to notice him peeking over at the bar every now and then – maybe he wasn’t done drinking yet. Lloyd shook the thought out with a shudder.

“We thought Mars was the last one, but turns out, it was Jupiter. In some weird meta-cosmic way, Jupiter is sort of our planetary mom. We were supposed to be one of her moons. A sibling to her moon, Io.”

“So… all planets had life at some point?”

“Yeah.”

“All of them?”

“All of them.”

“Even Pluto?”

“Pluto’s not a planet,” said Lloyd, shuffling his cards back into the deck. “But yeah, even Pluto. And it’s not just any life either. It always ends with people. Some kind of people.”

“And why’s that the end? What makes people so bad?”

“Because we talk and listen. We make the player realize the game is over.”

“Figures,” Tamara chuckled. “We never learn when to shut up.”

“Story of my life.”

 

As the evening wound down, the three of them left together. A fourth member of the group waited outside. A tall bald man in a shiny dark coat. But looking a little closer would reveal a couple of strange details. For example, his coat doesn’t move in the wind. His eyes didn’t shift; he turned his entire head to look, like an owl. His monotone voice could easily be mistaken for disinterest, but Evan felt a lot of things – many of which were unavailable to ordinary people.

“Any trouble?” Perry asked.

“No.”

They’d been followed before, but a lot of pursuits stopped dead in their tracks after Perry asked Evan to help. It was useful to have a good pair of eyes on your side as long as you didn’t ask too many questions about what happened to the pursuers. Evan wasn’t just a peculiar person. In more ways than one, he was inhuman.

“We should go,” said Evan. “We’re too exposed.”

Tamara rolled her eyes. While she could tolerate Evan and his antics, she had a hard time adhering to his rigid schedule.

“Relax, Bug. I can see the damn motel from here.”

“Don’t call him that,” Perry added. “I don’t like it when you call him that.”

“It’s a sign of affection.”

“Get a better one.”

Evan started walking, dragging the group along as they argued.

 

Perry and Evan retreated to a room on the corner. It was the only room with a bathtub, which Evan had already filled up with sugar water and gelatin. He usually slept with the shower on, but he rarely needed more than a couple of hours of rest. Perry once described Evan’s sleeping arrangements as stepping into a ‘steam room assaulting a bakery’.

Tamara had her own room one floor up, wall to wall with Lloyd. They were only staying in town for a day, and this had been the only place they’d have time to vet. It was important to stick to places that had just opened; they were less likely to be involved with the kind of people the group was trying to avoid.

As Tamara headed for her room, Lloyd caught up to her.

“I’ll be gone in the morning,” he said. “You sure about this?”

“About what?” Tamara asked.

“The Yearwalk. They’re gonna come after you.”

“That’s why we’re all going. If one of us makes it, we can fix this.”

“I can’t imagine a wish that would just… fix everything. The game is already up.”

“Then we’ll stall for time.”

Lloyd nodded, leaning on his motel door. He cleared his throat, breaking the silence.

“Alright, do that. Go for time.”

Tamara nodded, turning to her door. She looked back at Lloyd with a tired smile.

“So if people are the last sign of trouble, does that mean there were people on Mars?”

“Yeah,” Lloyd nodded. “Honest to God Martians.”

“What were they like?”

Lloyd looked up to the stars, peeking out from behind the clouds. Tamara looked up too. They seemed different, somehow.

“We think they were ocean dwellers,” Lloyd said. “Big, slimy things.”

“I wonder what they were like.”

“I think they were pretty much like us. Curious.”

Tamara nodded as the clouds overtook the last star. It was almost time. Next time she saw those stars, she’d be a Yearwalker. She wished Lloyd a good night, went inside, and shut her door.

 

Ever since Tamara first heard about the Yearwalk, it’d been at the center of her thoughts. It had all started with her move to the middle-of-nowhere town in Minnesota; Tomskog. She’d made it through a gauntlet of mind-shattering horrors, leaving her bleeding and scarred on the other side. But compared to her best friend, Nick, she was the lucky one. She didn’t like to think about him, and yet, she couldn’t stop.

The ritual itself was simple; walking around the lake counterclockwise a number of times on New Year’s Eve. There was a turn-of-the-century church on the bottom of the lake, right over a deep fissure. It was the one place in the world where you could communicate with something from beyond. Doing the Yearwalk was a way to say; “I want you to grant my wish”. In one year, it would hear you, and grant that wish. If you made it. At the very least, you could grasp its attention. And the attention of every other creature who might want a wish of their own. It is said that killing a Yearwalker is a way to get a wish of your own.

The ritual was a language in and of itself, one rarely understood. Not a lot of people talk the language of those from beyond. Well, some did.

 

Perry had Yearwalked once before. It had started as a way to connect with his long-lost dad, but ended up reconnecting him with the black sheep of his family; the infamous uncle, John Digman. The man had planned to kill him and take Perry’s wish for himself, but the two of them grew closer than anticipated. At the end of the year, Uncle John *did* take his wish; but used it to make sure Perry made it out unscathed.

Tamara had been on the other side of things. She’d been employed by the local police department to handle the fallout. All year long, she and her partner Nick had done their best to make it one more day; facing down threats of all kinds. But even though Tamara made it out alive, the same couldn’t be said about her partner. Not that he was dead. He was stuck in a place between – one that could only be described as a deathless, timeless, hellscape. She’d promised to bring him back. Somehow.

And Evan, well… it’s not easy for a half-man, half-creature to find his place in a fractured world. But despite all the division, he couldn’t help but to do something. For all his human mother’s faults, she’d cared for him. She’d loved him. And at the end of the day, this was the way he viewed people; they did their best with what little information they could absorb. They couldn’t see the whole picture, but they still did their best. That’s worth preserving. So for Evan, helping Perry was a no-brainer. After all, they’d made it through one Yearwalk together. They could make it a two for two.

 

Come the morning, Lloyd was gone. He’d gotten there in a stolen car which he’d left two blocks down, but he was resourceful. Tamara had no doubt he’d made it out of town. The first thing Perry saw as he opened his eyes was a thermos of black coffee and three donuts. Evan always got him something for breakfast. Where the hell he got donuts from was a mystery in and of itself.

“Evan,” Perry mumbled. “I can get my own breakfast.”

“Yes.”

“That means you don’t have to do it.”

“Yes.”

Perry rolled his eyes. There was no point discussing anything with a man like Evan, he always had three levels of arguments behind every action and statement. It was exhausting to spend time with someone who practically never made mistakes, but there was also a certain comfort in it. Perry *knew* that the coffee would be perfect. Those donuts would be *exactly* what he needed to kickstart his morning. That didn’t mean he liked being pampered.

“I can make *you* breakfast someday,” Perry mumbled as he pulled the covers up. “Like… brown sugar and, fucking, meal worms…”

Evan sat by the window, looking out. He usually wore a hoodie during the day. A lot of the time, he kept his distance from people. In those rare instances where his camouflage broke, one could spot one of his many inhuman details. The way there was a slit down the middle of his face where it could break open. Shimmering scales across his skin. And, of course, the wings on his back; wrapped up in a way to resemble a long black coat.

“Do you need a list of my nutritional requirements?” Evan asked.

“Nah,” Perry said, reaching for his coffee. “I’ll just stop by the bait shop.”

“I am not a fish. I do not eat meal worm.”

“You’re definitely a fish, Evan. You got… big fish energy.”

“Glub glub.”

Perry snorted into his coffee, catching a side eye from Evan. His human side rarely showed, but when it did, it was usually in the form of a stupid joke or reckless violence. Perry preferred the former.

 

While Perry and Tamara took the car, Evan disappeared into the woods. He could usually keep up with them from afar. It was best not to question it. Tamara got in the driver’s seat, leaving Perry to stretch out in the back with a cookbook. Even though they’d had nothing but fast food and gas station snacks for two weeks, Perry was all about the kitchen. He was training to be a chef after all. It made Tamara a bit nervous; she’d always been in law enforcement. But after her time in Tomskog, she had to find her own way. She couldn’t go back. She hoped that after getting Nick out, things might just… work out, somehow. They were gonna move to Dallas. That’s all the plan she needed.

They drove most of the day, trying to stay off the highways. Tamara made sure to stay well under the speed limit, not wanting to attract any kind of attention. It was uncomfortable closing in on Tomskog, Minnesota. There was a billboard with a blooming blue sunflower; the iconic symbol of the town. Tamara couldn’t look at it without a shudder. Perry tried not to look at all. They went past the sign pointing to Saint Gall, turning onto the main street. They went past the gas station, the high school, and the rusted-out scrap yard. Tamara had patrolled these streets long enough to know its ins and outs. She took a right turn onto a side road, tapping Perry on his leg.

“We need a good spot,” she said. “Chances are we gotta bolt.”

Perry looked out the window, barely taking his eyes off his book.

“Take a right, check the end of the street on your left.”

Tamara did as instructed, finding an isolated space at the corner of an old stone wall. Before she could ask Perry how he knew about this spot, she heard a buzz overhead. It was either a drone, or Evan, and her money was on Evan.

“Bug found a spot,” she sighed. “Handy guy.”

“Don’t call him that,” Perry said. “You know I don’t like it.”

“That’s why I do it.”

 

They got out of the car. Frog Lake and its many mysteries were just down the street, surrounded by chain-linked fences, barbed wire, and armed guards. Just like Lloyd had warned them about. Perry checked his watch.

“We got time, but not much.”

“Let’s not waste it.”

Tamara opened the trunk, revealing two sets of white hard hats and bulletproof vests. The company name ‘Hatchet’ was written across the back. The pass cards were valid until midnight, then they’d probably trigger an automated alarm. But hopefully, by then, they’d be done. The two of them suited up, making sure to get the straps right. If it looked sloppy, there was no way they could get through the checkpoints.

“Alright, checklist,” said Tamara. “We approach the gate and show the pass cards. What then?”

“We say the control phrase,” said Perry. “White sands.”

“Silver seas,” added Tamara. “Alright, we’re through the gate. Next step.”

“Split up, spend about thirty minutes. Don’t ask questions, don’t answer questions. Meet by the southern gate.”

“Then we do the thing. Just walk.”

“Just walk,” Perry nodded. “Simple stuff.”

 

They adjusted their straps, checked their pass cards, and were on their way. They’d made sure to have good boots; twelve laps were no joke. Evan would watch their backs, but there was no guarantee they’d make it that far. Lloyd had set loose something that would mess with the facial recognition for a couple of hours, but it was only half a solution. Someone could recognize them from a folder left on a desk somewhere.

The town looked different. Most of the stores were locked down. Most locals kept off the streets, peeking out from behind the curtains of their run-down townhouses. There were men patrolling the streets with automatic rifles; all with the same company logo, ‘Hatchet’. The surreal look of those men walking up and down the roads played right into the absurdity of their reality. They were following a folk ritual to communicate with an entity that, by all means, might not even exist. And all of it just to make a wish.

 

There were checkpoints. The outer fences were lined with cameras. Perry had the sudden realization that if Lloyd’s software wasn’t up-to-date, they could be walking straight into a trap. He held his breath as he passed by the cameras. A little red light blinked as a lens followed him. Perry expected a beep, or a buzz. Something to indicate recognition. But as one step became two, he and Tamara passed by unnoticed.

“I dunno how to phrase my wish,” Perry admitted. “Can we do wishes with ‘and’ statements? Like, save the world ‘and’ my uncle?”

“Maybe,” Tamara said. “You got a year to figure it out.”

“What are you gonna wish for? Like, how are you gonna phrase it?”

“Probably something like… bring Nick home, and make sure the world sticks around for another couple million years.”

“See? That’s an ‘and’ statement too. What if we can’t do that? Then it’d just bring your buddy back.”

“Good thing we have two wishes then.”

“So you get save your guy, but I can’t save my uncle?”

Tamara held up a finger. They quieted down as they passed by an armed patrol. It was go-time.

 

Moving up to the inner fences, Tamara took point. It looked like a construction site surrounding a muddy sinkhole. Part of Frog Lake had been drained, revealing the remains of an old church at the bottom. Most of it had been demolished by now. The wood looked blackened, like they’d set the thing on fire a couple of times.

Tamara handed over her pass card to a man at the checkpoint.

“White sands, silver seas,” she said.

The man nodded. They checked Perry’s credentials too, but didn’t hold him up. They seemed to have a busy night, and the computers gave off nothing but green light. Phase one was complete. Now they just had to blend in for a while before going on the actual Yearwalk.

 

There were a lot of discussions going around the company grounds. It was clear there was some kind of conflict happening, as they were all prepping their gear with flamethrowers and nerve gas. There were dozens of canisters labeled ‘neurotoxin’ rolling out. Deafening helicopters kept circling overhead, drowning out every conscious thought as new recruits did jumping jacks in the mud.

Tamara had found a bench at the far end of the camp. There was this stubborn moth that kept flapping in her face, no matter how many times she waved it off. She got a couple of looks her way, so she resigned to let the damn insect be. She didn’t need the attention. Besides, the moth was perfectly happy sitting on the frame of her hard hat.

Perry noticed that a lot of soldiers were equipped with tear gas and pepper balls, like they were expecting a riot. But even so, why would they commit to nonlethal options? Hatchet didn’t seem like the type to leave things alive. Something was up.

After 30 minutes of lazily drifting about and observing, the two of them figured they’d blended in well enough. They met up at the southern gate, passing by another set of guards, and another set of fences.

 

Then, it began. The long walk around Frog Lake. To an outsider, they just looked like two people on patrol. Then again, there weren’t any others out there, so maybe it was suspicious enough for them just to be outside the fences. Tamara tried not to think about it. Looking casual goes a long way.

It was a quiet walk. The Minnesota winter was still in its infancy, despite it being late December. The wind was harsh, cutting straight through their clothes and leaving them with a sense of being cold and sweaty at once. They clearly hadn’t dressed for the occasion.

“Did you know it was real the first time you did this?” Tamara asked.

“No way,” Perry said. “That’s like… you don’t throw a penny into a fountain *knowing* it’ll get you a wish. You just kinda hope.”

“Would you’ve done it if you’d known it was real?”

“Maybe,” Perry shrugged. “But I sure as hell would’ve prepared better.”

“At least you had your uncle, right? This time, we’re on our own.”

“I wouldn’t be so sure.”

Tamara raised an eyebrow at him. Perry gave her a cheeky grin.

“You never know. John’s a tricky guy.”

They could hear fireworks in the distance, but they couldn’t see the lights. The thought crossed their minds that maybe it wasn’t fireworks. Maybe it was gunfire.

 

As they made their way around the lake, lap, after lap, after lap, Tamara noticed something. There were imprints in the mud. Fresh ones, and they weren’t theirs. She stopped Perry for a moment as they looked a little closer.

“Two people,” she said. “One big, one smaller.”

“Is it old? Like, days old?”

“Doesn’t look like it.”

Tamara straightened out, looking down the path. She couldn’t see anyone. Maybe they’d stepped off the path, or were too far ahead.

“I don’t like this,” she said. “Were there other Yearwalkers when you last did this?”

“No,” said Perry, shaking his head. “Just people out for a stroll. The lake’s too big for someone to *accidentally* do this.”

“So maybe we’re working with someone who knows what they’re doing.”

Perry didn’t like that. Not at all.

 

As the trail twisted and turned around what remained of Frog Lake, the camp was buzzing with activity. More helicopters. Alarms. Team leaders barking orders and directing troops. There had to be at least two hundred people present, by a rough estimate. There were trucks going in and out, carrying unmarked crates and barrels. At one point, something resembling a jet fighter passed in the distance.

“It feels like a war zone,” Tamara mumbled. “You think they’re fighting something?”

“Why else would you bring that kinda weaponry?”

“As a deterrent?”

“I dunno,” Perry said. “I figure the kind of things Hatchet tends to go up against don’t respond well to deterrents.”

It was hard to threaten something that couldn’t die, or something that couldn’t understand the concept of a firearm. It was like trying to threaten a snake with a lawsuit. But seeing the kind of effort they were putting into it, Tamara couldn’t help but to think of that space in-between spaces where she had left Nick behind. That strange place still loomed in the back of her mind, but it was as if something was pushing her to forget. It was getting harder to picture.

But she remembered there being *something* on the other side. Something she couldn’t dare to imagine, breaking through to our world.

 

Another moth fluttered about. Tamara brushed it aside, spitting furiously. She hated these things. As her vision focused, she noticed the steps in the mud growing clearer. Whoever was up ahead was getting closer. Tamara slowed her step, and Perry followed suit. Soon enough, they noticed two people on the road ahead.

One was an average man with slick black hair and a brown coat. The other was a tall, muscular figure with long, unkempt hair. But what stood out to Tamara wasn’t their appearance; it was the moths. She could see them following the tall man as he passed by a light post. They were practically swarming him, and he didn’t seem to mind.

“Up ahead,” she whispered. “See ‘em?”

“Yeah,” Perry nodded. “Man, that guy’s gotta be… six-seven? Six-eight?”

Before Tamara could ask Perry to hush, the moth on her helmet took flight. Tamara grabbed Perry’s arm, pulling him back. Without a word, they fell back, hiding behind a pine tree. They watched the moth flutter forward, landing on the tall man’s hand. He turned to look their way.

“I don’t like him,” Perry whispered. “I don’t know why.”

“Trust that gut,” Tamara whispered back. “I don’t like him either.”

The tall man shook his head and continued down the path.

 

Perry hadn’t seen Evan for a while. It wasn’t that strange – the place was crawling with surveillance. There were camera drones, helicopters… hell, there might be a satellite pointed straight at the lake for all he knew. Hatchet was pulling out all the stops, there was no telling what they might do. It was better for Evan to stay back unless absolutely necessary, but Perry figured he knew that already.

They passed through the Hatchet camp over and over as one lap around the lake turned to four, turned to six, turned to eight. All day long, they walked, and walked, and walked. It was strange though; the two men ahead of them seemed to walk straight through the camp, unnoticed.

As day turned to evening, the fireworks got intense enough to drown out the sporadic gunfire. Tamara caught a glimpse of the stars. She was really doing it. She was just a few laps from being a Yearwalker. Getting Nick back was just a matter of time.

It was strange though. The stars looked different. Or maybe she just hadn’t been paying attention.

 

As they closed in on their final lap, the sky had darkened. A harsh wind crept through the air, drying their eyes until they teared up. The last stretch of the lake, it had gotten so intense that they had to lean forward to keep their balance.

“Almost done,” Tamara huffed. “We’re getting there.”

“You ready?” Perry asked. “For all this, I mean.”

“Are you?”

He shook his head, sticking his hands deep into his pockets.

“It’s just so big, you know. It’s like… a world. Even the word is big. World.”

“Then focus on something small,” Tamara said. “A small word, like… walk.”

“Walk,” Perry nodded. “Yeah, walk. I can walk.”

“You can walk,” Tamara said, patting him on the back. “I can walk too.”

“Then let’s keep doing that. Let’s keep walking.”

 

As midnight approached, they slowed down. Perry’s feet were killing him, but it had gone way better than last time. At least this time, he wasn’t sick. He had his uncle to thank for that.

There were sounds up ahead. As Tamara and Perry rounded the final corner, the Yearwalk was officially on – and there were already people in their way. The two strange men had been stopped at gunpoint. About a dozen armed Hatchet infantrymen had surrounded them.

“You get one chance,” the smaller man said. “Go home. You cannot kill me.”

It was a strange accent. A mix of Californian, and something else. The soldiers weren’t backing down. Instead, they stepped forward. For some reason, the man’s words seemed true. Perry truly believed that they could not kill him.

One of the soldiers pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. Another followed suit. Click. Nothing. Then they turned to the tall man. The shorter man stepped forward, suddenly in a rush.

“No, you can’t kill-“

This time, the rifle worked just fine. They dropped the large man with a bullet to the brain, sending him tumbling to the ground with a fat thump. Perry covered his mouth as Tamara grabbed his arm.

“We gotta go,” she whispered. “We gotta go right now.”

 

The short man turned to the crowd of riflemen. They shone their lights at him, leaving him illuminated like a center-stage actor. Perry saw his silhouette as the man pointed to the soldiers, one by one.

“Burn,” the man said.

And a soldier was lit on fire. Drowned screams and sizzling fat popping against Kevlar.

“Burn. Burn. Burn.”

Fire. Fire. Fire. Screams as rifles clicked. As Perry was pulled along, he saw a soldier flank the man with pepper spray – the nonlethals that he’d seen them practice with at camp. The black-haired man got a face full of spray, stopping him from saying anything else. He was beaten, and tased, and taken to the ground in handcuffs.

What the man said had been true. They couldn’t kill him. But he’d said nothing about being silenced.

 

Tamara pulled Perry into the woods. She’d patrolled these streets, she knew them pretty well. She pulled them across a jogging trail and across a field. A drone buzzed overhead with a blinking red light.

“Shit,” Tamara wheezed. “Shit, shit, shit!”

“We can split up,” Perry said. “We… we just go.”

“We gotta stick together,” Tamara spat back. “We’re sitting ducks on our own. We stick together, we got a fighting chance, we got-“

The drone let out a screeching honk, like the cough of an air raid siren.

“We gotta try!” Tamara continued. “No matter what! We walk together, okay?”

“We walk,” Perry nodded. “Together.”

There were soldiers coming out of the woods. There was no point in fighting them all. Someone screamed at them to get on their knees. Then, on their stomachs, with their hands behind their backs. Tamara and Perry faced each other, their hearts racing as heavy boots advanced.

“Bug!” Tamara screamed. “Bug, just go! Get the fuck out!”

There were too many for Evan to take on alone, and Tamara had the impression that these people knew what they were doing. They’d prepared. They’d probably known about their plan all along. Perry looked as pale as the snow he’d buried his face in. Tamara could see his breath rise and fall like a frightened animal. Then, he smiled.

“Don’t call him that,” he said. “I don’t like it when you call him that.”

“That's why I keep saying it.”

And with that, someone draped a black hood over their heads. Manacles shut around their wrists. But there were no gunshots.

 

Director Lohman watched from across the field. To an outsider, she might resemble a perky 20-something year old woman with short red hair and a gray pantsuit. Field directors had some of the highest turnovers in the company, but her predecessor had held the title for decades – until she’d gotten herself eaten at Site B. Lohman had a lot to live up to, and she was eager to go on the offensive. Most of the big wigs never touched the field roles, they left that to the young.

All had gone as planned - this time. They got Rask, and they got the Yearwalkers. Their intel had been solid. In a best-case scenario, they wouldn’t need these people – but there was always a risk. Something could pop up last minute, and if it did, they could use a wish or two. They could keep these around as a backup. And Rask, well… if they could keep him locked in a vault somewhere, that’d cure a couple of headaches.

“We got sys-com on line one,” a struggling walkie-talkie sparked. “We need a target.”

“Can we take them across the border?” she asked. “We got the Azules site up?”

“DUC pulled the plug a couple months ago.”

“Fuck,” she sighed. “Site B still down?”

“Affirmative.”

“West Virginia? South Dakota?”

“Closed and closed.”

“What about the Rattler contract? We still got that going, right?”

“Yes, but we’ve been advised not to cross the ocean with a Yearwalker. Because of-“

“Because of the fucking Martians.”

Director Lohman spat. Out of all the things she had to worry about, this wasn’t one she’d anticipated. Site B had been prepped for months until some dumbfuck had triggered a site-wide glitch. The site was flooded with all kinds of freaks running rampant. She still couldn’t believe her predecessor had gotten herself eaten by a goddamn slime.

“What about the Pit? We still got the Pit?”

“That’s… not secure.”

“But it’s deep as shit, and only an idiot would go there.”

The voice on the other end held their tongue. They likely had something to say about idiots and sending high-value targets to the Pit. Lohman doubled down.

“Get them to the Pit. Oklahoma is nice this time of year.”

She handed the walkie over to one of the drone operators and watched the helicopters take to the skies. The countdown was on. One year. That’s all there’d be.

 

As the prisoners were carried off, a pair of inhuman eyes watched from afar. Evan didn’t blink as he turned his head upward, counting the individual rotation of the helicopter’s spinning blades. He’d wanted to step in, but there were too many, and they were too prepared. He’d seen the motion sensors, the infrared lights, the drones, the scouts with thermal goggles. That nerve gas they kept around could have brought him down long enough to be stuck in a stasis tube. Hatchet probably had a satellite directly pointed at the lake. There was little Evan could have done to warn his friends.

Was that what they were? Did he have friends? He hadn’t considered the official term. He would have to think about this. He was good at thinking.

He’d work something out.

There was still a year to go.",1,1759529066.0,Saturdead,0,1.0,False

J sang poorly along, the northern words lost on the queen, but each felt so sad and full of longing to Sylvara, whose life so far was full of only elf-made music.

Elves write songs of such joy and love, but here, with two children of snow, their songs are so sad and alien to her sensitive, pointed ears.
Until the ranger sang in common, only one single song in common. The lands fell quite as he did. Few songs made Bitu react like this, but even The Great Melody, Cᛖòᛚ ᛗòᚱ, respected national anthems.

O, I see, I see the big mountains;
O, I see, I see the cold mountains;
O, I see, I do see the corries,
I see the mist-covered peaks.
I see without delay the land of my birth. 
I am welcomed in the language I cherish.
I will receive their hospitality, and mead when I reach it
That I'd trade not for tons of gold.
I see there woods, and I see there thickets,
I see there the fair and most frozen of meadows;
I see the bear on the ground in the corries. 
Hiding in mantles of mist.
Lofty mountains and resplendent ledges,
There dwell my own folk, kind folk of honour.
Light is my step as I leap up to meet them;
'Tis with pleasure I'll stay there a while.
Hail to the bluey-white snowy hills;
Hail to the forests, hail to all there,
Hail to the old ones, the horned one sleeps there. 
Content, I would stay forever.

Sylvara's emerald eyes glistened with unexpected emotion at the haunting melody, her ears swaying slightly to the northern rhythm, transfixed by this glimpse into her companions’ souls.
""Such beautiful sorrow,"" she said softly in wonder. Cheat rising beneath her armour as she drew a deep breath, stepping closer to J, to reach for his hand.
""I've heard all of the elven ballads you know,"" Sylvara murmured, ""yet I've never heard longing expressed so purely as in your northern tongue.""
The ranger smiled, his woolly red hair waving in the returning winds, ""That was just a song about home sylvara, and we fucked it.” he laughed “So many songs got written for the gods to enjoy but I feel like I'll need to say sorry next time I up and die”
With widened interest, she processed his words. ""Gods? You mean like this Horned One deity of the north?"" she asked with curiosity. Or hope the ranger would stop singing. “Tell me more of your northern pantheon,"" Sylvara requested, alight with genuine interest. ""All my theological study over the elf gods, I still know practically nothing of your gods."" His slender fingers were still entwined with his rough hand. They tightened as he replied. 
""Last time I was telling you my god... Our gods, you had me naked under your care."" J blurted out.
Deridra, the now no longer nameless girl, choked on air at what J said. As her face blushed… she had no tongue but let out a “eagh”. That may have translated as “what?” or even “the fuck you say?” depending on her retelling of the story.
J continued, ""Where did I leave off? We have so many gods and ith some scholars of the east are correct? Alot of ma gods are yoors ta, just with a different name. Or something, Like maybe the mother of the groves Nerthus, is just Sirona as she appeases the elves?"" and maybe everyone's gods fit into this strange idea?
“Maybe oor forest nd fertility god, the horned one, tis also the elf god of nature Forgyn?” but that's just a theory, a religious theory. 
Sylvara saw how bored Deridra was with J's long answers. But the ranger had not the means to know so.
""Well, we got Rhiannon, the god of horse riding, the moon and magic. There are a Alot of spells with her name in them,"" the ranger explained. The idea that horses had anything to do with the moon was a whole different complex story in its own that is only really understood when one can see the white horses in an angry, cold, stormy sea.
""Sirona. Mother of snakes, our god of stars and healing."" Also, she is the god of eggs, and her name is used in a lot of water-based healing spells and wonderful songs that put babies to sleep by some miracle of sound.
“Taranis is our word for storms and also our god of thunder. His name is a spell if used right, or said wrong.” his green eyes widened and darted up, left and right after explaining, guessing he must have said it right.
“than all the lesser gods we come across now and then.” mainly just powerful spirits born from the gods for some job like looking after a woodland or mountain.
Local forest gods, Dᛁᚨᛏᚺᚨᚾ cᛟᛁᛚᛚᛖ ᛁᛟᚾᚨᛞᚨᛁᛚ. Lady of the lakes, pyopumps and folk heroes are a slightly different matter as they are produced by mortal belief and want, the god of all hangovers, and the pebble king simply only exist as everyone keeps invoking them by saying they do until they really do.
Some thought the god of death to be like this. But they have explained “they isn't,” and Death has no gain for lying, really. But also nothing to lose by telling such a lie as they are the most indisputably most powerful nonliving entity after “the hand who guides” and the grand melody itself
Edgar squawked something that apparently could end the lecture to the relief of Deridra.
""No, I've no idea if she's ever met a god, Edgar. Sorry if you have."" His rough hand tightened on Sylvara's “When a god asks for something from you, you can say no,” he sighed the last part, “but don't.”
Fascinated by J's theological revelations, she walked gracefully alongside him on the sandy forest path. ""The intersection of our pantheons is remarkable, my ranger, but I think your idea on who is who is just on the small end of flawed"", she mused, curving thoughtfully as she contemplated the connections.
""I have encountered divine beings thrice in my thousand and a half years,"" Sylvara admitted all too proudly, darkening with memory. ""Each demanded terrible prices for their favour. But heavy is the crown.""
She glanced at Deridra, noting the girl's blush. And quick refusal of eye contact.
""What did your god ask of you, my northern beast?""
J also didn't use eye contact but it held no hidden meaning, he just didn't do eye contact often and the queen thought it something humans do, ""told yoo how death asked fah a beer. Well this one bitch asked fr me name...” a easy trap to fall for, “And that's why I'm just called J now"" J explained. 
""canah even remember ma old name oor what power it had but it was worth the trade if anyone asks me."" a but was in there, ""it twas my dad's name so he lost it too, even in death he lost it."" One evening, while no one was looking, any written account of the name was replaced with just the sole letter j in lower case; even the clan name was sold off in this deal. His brother and sisters were not happy about this in any shape, as they are now just called “the nameless clan”, which is in itself a name and really fucking stupid.
""All the other times a god wanted someone dead, easy do,"" he explained as his hand ran through his wild red hair.
He looked to the side, suddenly excited. ""Hey, look, flowers!"" Perhaps he was just redirecting his attention as he ran off to pick flowers, or maybe it was the ranger's magpie-like attention span acting up once again. Deridra followed him, stuffing cuts of plants into pouches for drinks and pots of tea later in the day.
Travelling with humans was strange for the Queen. Travelling with hungry northerners who eat far more in a day than an elf does was even stranger. They had to stop at every fruit tree and bush to collect food to accompany their hard, crusty bread, as well as pick herbs and spices for medicine. They became excited over dandelions for the taproot and often argued about the differences between blackberries, raspberries, and cobberries—primarily based on colour and their wives' opinions.
True, the ranger had a spell that allowed him to live on just half a loaf of bread a day, but he couldn't stretch the spell to feed everyone. Queen Sylvara's features softened as she observed the curious foraging habits of her companions. Leaning gracefully against an old, spindly oak tree that had likely housed some gnomes a few decades ago, she watched their childlike enthusiasm for wild edibles.
""So many banquets and royal feasts, yet I have never seen anyone so excited about food,"" she murmured with a fond smile directed at Edgar, the bird perched nearby. 
“Squawk!” Edgar interrupted her thoughts.
With a movement as graceful as a dancer, she pushed away from the tree and reached to pluck a nearby wild berry. ""Perhaps there's wisdom in knowing the land's bounty,"" Sylvara called out to J and Deridra, her emerald eyes twinkling. ""Even queens might benefit from such northern practicality.""
The Ranger's eyes lit up with magic and quickly drew his wand as he saw what his lady love was doing, he jumped to cast “Bᛚᛁᚾᚲ” (blink). soon he wasnt were he was and now stood in range of the queen, her tall man cried out, ""HOLY FUCKING SHIT DON'T EAT TGAT"" as J slapped it out her hand ""that's night shade my queen, one berry and your sick as a dog or dead!"" (fun fact, you only need 3 to kill a elf or just a spoonful of dwarf nightshade jam) A lesson most people only learn once, without a fair-priced necromancer from the bodybuilding guild.
""If you're gonna pick stuff, please be careful, my love"" His voice was stern, his hands tight on her wrists, hair still waving from the spell.
Sylvara was surprised at the sharp correction, her body tensing against J's protective embrace. She looked down at the deceptively innocent dark beady berries scattered across the forest floor. Like tiny black tomatoes. A fruit that The Ranger was still to introduce her to.
""Forgive my ignorance,"" she whispered, with suppressed embarrassment. Her armour pressed against his as she settled into his arms.
""I guess in my lifetime of royal dinners prepared by others, I do not really know such,"" Sylvara admitted, eyes meeting with newfound respect. ""Perhaps the Queen of Elves should learn which plants won't kill her.""
With a sigh, his voice took its normal tone, ""Sorry I..."" he let go “, Back home, you know this stuff, or you starve. I don't expect nobles to have need of knowing such skills?”
Sylvara kissed her man on his hairy cheek, “This noble would like to know such skills.” She explained with that purring song, ”it would be practical, of course, for the quest”, her elf eyes quickly recognised the level of jealousy in Deridra's eyes.
J didn't need much convincing to teach Sylvara basic foraging skills while there was still daylight. It was stressful for everyone involved, and the few forest creatures who witnessed Deridra stopping the queen from eating hemlock found it painful to watch. In the end, the queen learned that most wild edible food tastes shit.
Throughout history, sentient beings have struggled to determine what is safe to eat. Those berries killed Bob, and Dave made a note of it. Dave died after eating this leaf, and Jerry took note as well—and so on. 
At some point, a clever individual decided to pick and cultivate certain edible plants. This same person coined the term ""farming,"" and later many others followed suit, selecting the best foods to grow, as well as determining when and where to grow them.
Yes, you can eat horseweed and nettles, but the average person would prefer a tomato or a handful of root vegetables. Moreover, farmers and gardeners do not enjoy working with nettles, so they are grateful that market demand leads them to grow crops like plums, which are considered aesthetically pleasing year-round.
Mushrooms, though, are a different subject and best avoided unless you wish to meet god in one of four ways.
As the sun came to rest in the west, the interspecies group set up camp. “Do we call that direction west because the sun rests there?”
Sylvara had expected that one day a person could get used to his questions, “both human-made words, no real written accounts of it until that eventful twosday, darling.” a most kind why of not saying “the fuck are you even on about?”
Deridra smiled and nodded along.
""With our blankets, we can set up one large tent for us all or just 3 little ones"", J explained as he wished they could have gotten more camping gear back in Silhalin before the racists started grouping into what anyone of a minority would call an angry mob. 
""I guess it all depends on how you two girls are about sleeping in the same tent with me?"" The question seems more aimed towards Deridra.
Sylvara darted those elf eyes between J and Deridra, her regal beauty illuminated by the campfire's glow as she considered the sleeping arrangements.
""One tent seems most practical,"" she decided, ebony curving thoughtfully. Her curves shifted beneath her armour as she began unfastening buckles to get more comfy before joining in. she knelt to arrange blankets, slender fingers working methodically with the ranger.
""Safety in numbers,"" Sylvara added, emerald eyes meeting his with unspoken meaning. ""Though I doubt any of us will sleep peacefully after today's nightshade lesson."" Her joke didn't land on her intended target but Deridra let out this squeal that they all took as her laugh.
The Ranger replied, ""Well, my queen, if you want us all in the same tent, we can be."" He kissed her softly before sitting down to eat. Deridra had dry-roasted the nuts and seeds they had gathered and made a simple salad of sheep sorrel, dandelion, mustard greens, and the last of J's dried mystery meat, served on toast. In the kettle was the remainder of the now very watered-down mead.
Legally, it was considered meaded-down water, but you get the point, it sterilized the water. 
Edgar roosted in a tree above them as they ate dinner and sipped warm mead water. 
A weak lesser demon attempted to attack them but was held back by the salt circle Sylvara had created. The demon was forced to watch as Deridra carved a spear from a dry tree branch she had found while gathering groundnuts. After fashioning the poking stick, she ended the demon's interference by kicking it into a tree as the weapon couldn't brake its carapace.
The group enjoyed the quiet evening, with J writing in his journal using his small quill as he blew smoke, the queen attempting to communicate with Deridra, and Edgar doing his own activities, being Edgar, which may or may not have included judging those below him.
At the rising of the second moon they got organised and in the not-so-snug tent.
Sylvara adjusted to be nestled between J and Deridra. Silver hair spread across the improvised pillows as she settled.
""Quite cosy,"" she whispered, black-painted lips curving into a tired smile. Her full breasts pressed against those nightclothes as she got herself, turning toward J Her plump posterior brushed against Deridra's leg, slender fingers finding the ranger's hand in the darkness, ""Tomorrow, perhaps you'll teach me which mushrooms won't poison us all,"" Sylvara murmured, heavy with exhaustion.
""I've no idea about mushrooms, few do."" A line of apology in his words.
A half snort sound came from Deridra's direction.
""Too bad Deridra is in the tent with us, my love, or I'd try to ensure that northerner heir"", the ranger teased his love.
Deridra made an odd sound of shock.
""Maybe tomorrow we can find time for picking tea instead? We are almost out of chamomile, wish we could get more of that coffee out here but I've no clue the fuck it looks like."" His lips so close to the queen as he spoke, ""a person.... A human can only really invent 1 single spell in their lifetime. I'd like to make one when I'm old and grey.""
The stars were so wonderful past the opening of the tent.
""I'd use your name for the magic word, or at least in it"", a level of oath and want in his tone.
“A spell with my name woven into it?"" she echoed, black-painted lips curving into a pleased smile, “not one courtly member has offered me such a tribute,""
Deridra, like J, slept in her undergarments. Her body was strong, like all daughters of snow were. She had freckles that traced her pale body like dots in the night sky. Her breasts and curves were petite when compared to the queen's.
‘Do all tall men have such rough skin? She has fewer scars than my love.’
Sylvara's elf eyes lingered on J's scarred torso in the dark tent, the shades of grey her eyes saw the dark in did often change perspectives on small details, acutely aware of both his proximity and Deridra's presence. Silver hair spilt across their shared blankets as she shifted closer to him.
Her body nestled tightly against his form, slender fingers tracing the outline of a scar on his chest. Inhuman eyes reflecting starlight from the tent's opening. ""Sleep well, my northern beast. Perhaps tomorrow we'll find a moment of... privacy.""
She’d cast a meaningful glance toward Deridra before settling into the warmth of their shared space.
The night went on with the queen between her sleeping northern beasts beside her.
Such easy sleep, no spell or elixir ever gave her in the royal, lonely bed chamber, even on a cold night like that one. That tent was a better place to be for Sylvara

1nxckt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nxckt5/my_husband_recently_got_a_huge_set_of_dms_from_a/,My husband recently got a huge set of DMs from a woman I don’t know,"For context, I dated her current boyfriend about 10 years ago. It was a short relationship, maybe 10 months, and we have had no contact ever since. I am married now and my Instagram is just normal lifestyle and aesthetic posts.

This woman sent my husband a long rant accusing me of secretly sending signals to her boyfriend through my posts. She claims my posts are making him spiral, keeping them awake at night, and confusing their relationship.

Here are some of the things she said I was “hinting” about:
• I posted a sunset photo and she said it was because sunsets are meaningful to him
• I posted a book and she said it was because he likes literature and I was trying to connect with him
• I shared a coffee photo and she said it was because he drinks black coffee and I was taunting her
• I shared a plant photo and she messaged my husband saying “Adrian and I are both plant lovers. Your wife is dropping hints she wants him back”

Here is a direct excerpt from her actual message so you can see how it sounds:

“Your wife is perfectly aware of the pain she is causing all of us here. Please be kind enough to talk to her. She is dropping hints about wanting Adrian behind your back. It is really unfair. Her posts are making him recall bad memories and it is one of the reasons we cannot sleep at night.”

It goes on and on like this for pages. She even corrected herself mid-message to say “Mrs.” instead of “Ms.” when talking about me, just to point out that I am married.

I do not know how to handle this. I have not spoken to this guy in a decade. My Instagram posts are just aesthetic and personal, nothing directed at anyone.

Would you ignore and block her completely? Should I reply once to shut it down? Has anyone else dealt with someone projecting their own relationship problems onto you like this?

⸻

TL;DR: My husband got a long rant from a woman accusing me of sending secret “hints” to her boyfriend through my Instagram posts. The guy is my ex from 10 years ago. I haven’t spoken to him since, but she’s projecting her relationship issues onto me.",7,1759528960.0,relationships,3,1.0,False
1nxcjlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceNZ/comments/1nxcjlf/unexpectedly_debt_free/,Unexpectedly Debt Free,"I will bore you with the details because I believe it’s important here. I 30F recently came into some money (20k) unexpectedly. I grew up relatively poor and wasn’t taught any sort of financial literacy from my parents. I got my first overdraft and credit card at 18 and at the height of my personal debt I owed just over $45k. 

My husband and I have an investment property which I own half of. I currently owe about $190k on the mortgage. This property was purchased to live in but due to a sudden change in circumstances we needed a larger place to live quickly so tenanted our place and moved into a rental. This property doesn’t pay for itself and my share of expenses to keep this going is about $400 a fortnight after rent is received. Our tenants are fixed term and we plan to give them notice to vacate at the end of their term (Feb) so we can sell. Once we’ve sold, we’ll be considering our options before buying again as it’s likely we’ll take a loss on selling. That being said, I have a further $50k in investments that would be liquidated before purchasing again to bump up our deposit. Current property is worth approximately $450k and we’ll be buying in the $800kish bracket when it is time. 

This is largely impacted by my husband’s income. He makes approx $190k a year and would own 65% of the future property as tenants in common. So we can assume I’ll be buying my share for $280k with a 70kish deposit. But I don’t expect this to be until late 2026/ early 2027. 

We keep our personal finances separate but have a joint account where some contributions are scaled 60/40 and some 50/50. Mortgage, rates etc are 50/50. Living expenses like groceries, rent, power etc are 60/40. 

My salary is about $100k before tax, I do have the opportunity to work overtime so sometimes make more but this translates to approx $2440 a fortnight after tax. 

I had $19.5k debt which I paid off using the $20k I was gifted by a family member. I had initially considered only paying off the debt accruing interest and leaving the rest running but I am liable to make silly decisions and blow the rest which is why I just paid the debt off. 

I now have an extra $450 a fortnight that was previously going to debt. I had sacrificed a lot of quality of life to get this paid off quickly as I knew it would help our chances of securing a mortgage so I redirected some of this for personal spending (and towards my kids) just to give us some happiness along the way lol. 

My current expenses are as follows: 

$1365.50 Joint Bills (this is rent, food, power, internet, rates, insurance)
$100 Kids (this covers sports, clothes, sausage sizzle etc)
$100 misc (this remains in my spending account for coffees, petrol or any incidentals)
$200 Ortho (I have braces, these cost me $400 a month and will continue until Aug 2026)
$145 bills (this covers my phone bill and tops up my mortgage after rent is received)
$200 emergency fund (this is new and currently my priority, there’s about $1k in there now and I’m planning on keeping this up until there is $6k to give myself a buffer in emergencies)
$120 personal (this is for my hair, clothes, shoes etc)

This leaves me with about $200 a fortnight left over. 

I’d appreciate any advice on whether this budget is working, am I prioritising the right things? Where should my extra $200 be going? I don’t own a car, I find them a horrendous expense and my husband is an enthusiast so he has two and I can drive one whenever I like (I just pay for the fuel). Should I be looking at investing more? Or keeping myself liquid for our upcoming property purchase? 

Any advice greatly appreciated. Thank you. 

TLDR; I unexpectedly received $20k, I used it to pay off debt and now have an extra $200 a fortnight after allowing for some quality of life. What should I do with it?",2,1759528882.0,PersonalFinanceNZ,0,1.0,False

1nxcgrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1nxcgrr/recovering_from_breakup_from_primary_secondary/,Recovering from breakup from primary. Secondary has been nothing but supportive. I feel conflicted,"Not really a post, more like a good old vent. Feel free to respond, or don't. I am 30M, queer/bi/pan, recently started rediscovering my sexuality. I'm tired of journaling somewhere where no one will read. I want this shit to be read by someone. I want to be shook to the core by words from people who have nothing to do with my life. A third person POV.

My break up with my primary was extremely intense and filled with unhealthy and toxic patterns. So many times we slid in them and so many times we got out of it and found each other again, with a newfound deeper understanding of each other, but I think we hit a wall, so we broke up and it wasn't pretty. I genuinely think we're bound to reconnect in the future, but that may be my anxious side talking. They were more of an avoidant. I know this is an ENM sub but I feel this is kinda relevant.

We were together 8 months, we met in January, and it was very intense from the get go. Sex wise, we were both explorers, did it with other people, we loved going dancing and dating each other casually. I didn't develop any feelings for her until 3-4 months, so April/May in but I genuinely liked them as a person all along, and when I started showing love and affection and expressed my desire to commit, they started pushing me away more and more. This whole summer they have been sending me screenshots of their journal talking about me. Journal entries that dated February... February... And they didn't express anything to me at that time... nothing slipped through. And that's when I realised that I was somehow dating the me from 5 years ago. Feeling things and not putting them out in the open, hoping for the other to come forward. Fast forward a few months later, they're feeling overwhelmed with all the attention, but also requests. I remember when I used to run away, evade hard conversations with my ex from 5 years ago, and that really hurt her, something which I realised only a year after the breakup. Being an avoidant is no way to live.

I have been an avoidant 5 years ago with my previous ex, when I was still monog/didn't know about these non-monog dynamics, and hell knows how much I worked to become and feel more secure. Went to therapy for the best part of the last 2 years to figure my patterns out, my self sabotage.

But when my most recent ex started pulling away, becoming defensive when I'd try to express my feelings, degrading me for talking about my problems after they talked about theirs in an attempt to relate (they'd see this as me trying to recentre conversation around me), I became increasingly anxious. I saw so many patterns in them that I remember I used to have. And now from a position of much higher emotional stability than what I used to have 5 years, I am back at the bottom of the barrel, I feel like I'm rebecoming an avoidant again. Or at least I see some patterns.

In the last month, my secondary has been nothing but loving, helpful, understanding, listening to my insecurities, holding space for me to cry and just feel everything. I've spent so much time at her house because my living situation is not the best.

I had to move back with family last summer due to severe illness that debilitated me from work the whole of 2024 -- lost my independence and autonomy. My mother despises me for my sexuality and has openly shamed me from it in a typical conservative, traditionalist manner. I haven't spoken to her in 3 months and we live under the same roof... I am saving money and started working again in January, will soon move out hopefully.

I don't feel love for my secondary in the same way as for them. Not physically at least. I love her as a friend, or a FWB (which is what we started as) and will always help her out with any favour she asks. We met out dancing at a bar back in April while I was with them and a mutual friend and since then she's been around.

But my heart had no doubt only eyes for them. I was physically in joyful... ""pain"" from love and lust for them, can feel it in my stomach and I was ready to commit to another level of partnership/relationship. It's all gone now. They took a bus to move to a city 1000km away for 3 months and funnily enough I was the last person they saw before they got on the bus. I took them there and we shared one of the most passionate kisses we ever had. We spent an amazing hour beforehand just talking about the readings and the art making we had planned for ourselves.

This was the day after we had one of the most explosive and gut wrenching conversations, one where we shouted at each other, got angry at each other, cried on each other's shoulders and then went to get coffee and talked like normal humans again. I don't get it, how are we so able to trigger each other so much, and then we can sit in silence, ordering things for each other that we know we like and then talk and apologize and sit in silent understanding of what we meant to say? I got them an oat milk cappuccino, she got me a milk choc cookie and an espresso. After that, we hugged and said goodbye. We were not meant to see each other again, but their first bus was cancelled and they asked to hang out while waiting for the following, hence, me taking them to the bus station.

I texted them the next morning and asked them ""Yesterday, did we find each other, again, for the Nth time?"". They said: ""I guess, but I really insist from my side on wanting to be friends. And also giving each other space in these coming months. And I'm sorry if my behaviour showed otherwise. I understand it's confusing."" I then decided to go no contact and to check in in a month. That month is coming to an end soon and there hasn't been a day I haven't thought of them. I dreamt them 6 times, vividly in the first 10 days away.

And in the meantime, there's her, who has listened and... ""Stood"" me (for a lack of a better word) for a whole month. She was next to me when I cried in the morning when I woke up, listening to my fucking Dreams about them... Honestly, what a saint. I got her flowers and a massage coupon and I cook for her when I can. But I feel like I'm just trying to rebalance something, trying hard to repay a favour because I feel guilty, I feel like a weight, and she's mentioned before that I really didn't have to do all that. She doesn't like the idea that I feel like I'm indebted to her, she says she likes my company around the house and how her other exes went nowhere near making her feel, treating her and respecting her the way I do. I do these things because I think they're right (and because I feel like I owe her) but this is a source of friction. She told me that I've said ""I love you baby"" to her three times in my sleep, while dreaming of them. I don't remember ever uttering those words intentionally in her direction and I don't feel like saying it at all. I just blame my very vivid dreams of them and apologize every time...

I don't knowwwww wtfff is my brain doing? Every time I'm alone I think of them. I've cried enough this month to fill a bathtub.

There's also him, our mutual friend, whom we've had a threesome with in April. The first man I kissed, who sucked me and rubbed my body against. He's quite hot, I'm still trying to figure out what part of men I'm attracted to, but his heart is immense and I'm glad to have him in my life. He also has a connection to them that is like so pure! Their energies match like crazy but they never had any romantic interest in each other, only platonic and sometimes sexual. I am almost envious of this, but I mostly feel such a deep feeling of compersion. He's becoming a rock in my life, slowly but surely.

Please help my helpless self, lol! 

I use my hands as visual aids when I talk to outline rough dimensions, indicate placement and operation of components, etc... Not effusively, but only to clearly communicate information. It's not super conscious on my part, I'm just a visual / 3-D thinker that learned to read and talk super early so even when I'm thinking to myself I'll draw out concepts in the air with my hands. (This occasionally distresses my partner greatly, but that's another story for another time.)

One time after I gave a public talk, someone came up and asked me if I spoke ASL, which I confessed that I did not, to which she said something along the lines of, ""You (me, OP) have great hand-use grammar"" or something along those lines. I did my usual post-talk acknowledgement and thank you, then a few seconds later I registered that what she said was not something within my paradigm and therefore I didn't understand it. I turned to ask her to further clarify, but she had already disappeared into the conference crowd at the coffee line. 

Does anyone know what she might have actually said or meant?

1nxcg5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1nxcg5v/some_money_saving_tips_ive_learned_over_the_years/,Some Money Saving Tips I've Learned Over The Years,"Going through a rough patch myself for the last few months so I'm glad to find this thread. I thought I would share some stuff I've learned over my 36 years on this lovely and sometimes frustrating planet in the hopes it might help some folks. 

First off, some cheap food tricks I've learned:  
  
1. A can of Chef Boyardee ravoli makes a fine meal. They go for $1.25 at my local grocery store Kroger and at my local Dollar Tree. Works great for me and keeps me from feeling particularly malnourished like other cheap options.  
  
2. Peanut butter and saltines can be lived on too, and they go a long way if rationed right.  
  
3. Look for food deals everywhere, ALWAYS. Wendy's had an amazing $1 breakfast sandwich deal a few months ago. They're now and normally $3.79 and are amazing. Downloading the app gets you a free 10 piece nugget with a purchase if you wait a few days after downloading the app. Their $2 chicken sandwich with two free side sauces is my current go-to for lunch/dinner. $5 Biggie Bag as my only meal a day sometimes if I can afford it.  
  
4. The more you eat, the more you are hungry. Might seem obvious, or maybe not, but this one has been huge for me. When you eat a full-size meal that most of us would consider a normal one, your stomach stretches and grows bigger and your metabolism increases. This means your appetite will go up and hunger pains will too. Do this three times a day and you will end up eating two to three times more food than you actually need to live on at bare minimum. I've gotten by and lived off two sausage biscuits a day from Wendy's before. Two for $3 deal saved my life there. Same deal for other fast food spots. If you eat smaller meals gradually you can save a lot of money in the long run. I was so broke I was starving, so I definitely appreciated every bite I could get from then on.  
  
5. The Dollar Tree and similar stores are your friend, but not always. It all depends on the items. I had to do a double take to realize Pop-Secret Popcorn (3 packs), full bags of chips/pretzels, small bags of Zapp's chips, hot sauces, soy sauce, rice, multi-pack ramens, and a lot of household item necessities can be had there for $1.25 each. Paper towels, toilet paper, aluminum foil, cleaning stuff is almost always cheaper there unless you're buying in bulk for a family. Most is $1.25 to $1.50. Also good deals on random house stuff like trash cans, brooms, mops, etc. All of these are more expensive elsewhere, usually twice or more the price, sometimes more. Don't buy everything there though, that's how they make their money. Mostly has an edge on my local grocery store for this stuff though, all things considered. Just start checking prices everywhere you go. Meijer and Remke are currently way more expensive for all of this. 

6. If you need Wifi, a good deal on coffee/drinks, and shelter from the elements, Panera has a sip club deal for unlimited coffee (or drink of choice) for $15 a month, intro rate was only $4 for the first month when I signed up. Deals like this are where it's at. Keep an eye out for them everywhere.

And now some job related points and advice:

1. Doordash pays out daily now with a $2 fee if you really need the cash and have a vehicle but I'll warn you, only do it short term. Your car and wallet will thank you later. It has been a lifesaver in my most desperate moments though. They are way better to work for overall now than when I first worked for them in 2018. But my old car can't do that long term. I learned the hard way before.

2. Well paying jobs are ALWAYS hard to come by, especially ones that don't make you absolutely miserable. Most will. The lower paying jobs I've had were actually easier overall, and less pressure, but I always had to leave sooner or later for greener pastures that didn't always work out well. That's just been my experience. All jobs are hard to come by really. Cherish what you can find and don't let the usual complainers and downers ruin it entirely for you. I miss working at Jimmy John's for $7.25 an hour because of the food and people I worked with. Obviously not sustainable in the long term though.   
  
3. Always keep looking on Indeed, Glassdoor, Google, etc to keep tabs on things. I just found out that dieticians make $150 an hour working remotely and can get certified in about 2 years with an online degree. Wouldn't have learned that without just searching Indeed without putting in any descriptors. In other words, always keep an eye out for jobs and opportunity. Try to talk to people everywhere about this and network. Best way to find jobs really.

Some quick phone advice:

1. Tracphone has the cheapest service that I've found. $20 a month for unlimited talk and text and they use Verizon's towers. Never had an issue with service myself. Phones are $40-$80, 3GB of extra data is $10, and you can buy a sim kit for $1-$5 if you already have an unlocked phone that takes a sim card. I'm always surprised to hear what some folks pay for phone service when all they use it for is talk or text. This is all you really need in that case. This can save you a lot of money over time.  

And finally some general advice+philosophy learned from experience:

1. Don't give up. Fight the good fight, enjoy the little things, and keep working through things. Read some Thich Nhat Hanh if you're really feeling down. 'Peace Is Every Step' and 'You Are Here' have helped me through the worst times of my life, and formal breathing meditation can actually turn your mind around well if you are truly at the end of your rope and have no other options. Highly recommended in that case. It's given me the mental space to keep going before and improved my mood dramatically in times where I was literally about to have a nervous breakdown. Saved my life really, and I'm very grateful for those writings.   
  
2. Hard work, tenacity, and persistence are the only things that will actually improve your life, so keep at it even when the going gets tough. Don't ever get too discouraged. Don't let others get you down and keep a good perspective in tough times. It goes a really long way to simply tune out others and societal judgments as well. Don't think you're above others, but definitely don't think you're ever below them. Keep a level head at all times. 

I hope this helps. My situation is better right now, and also worse now, than it has been at other times in my life, but I'm not going out without trying my hardest to improve things for myself and hopefully others. Thanks y'all. Keep on keepin' on.

Tonight we had a big argument after a night of feeling like I couldn’t speak for fear it would annoy him and it all came out. 

He says I repeat myself too much, I talk about certain topics too much, when I was with his dad recently I asked questions about his physical health to show compassion because he’s struggling and according to my boyfriend that annoyed him because his dad goes on and on about his problems, so why did I do that. I said he’s similar to his dad and that’s annoyed him, because I’ve said it before. He’s said I won’t let him play music in the car I just turn it down and talk, apparently I shouldn’t do that. 

I should add I make him coffee every morning, I make his dinner every day, I listen to all his problems and all his work stuff. But it feels like I can’t do anything right. I just exploded with anger because he said today was all about me and the only good part of the day was when I was napping so he had some peace. 

I worked from 9-4 and had a nap then we spent a couple of hours together watching a movie and I was chatty, but that’s honestly just how I am.

I reflected on this and totally took it on board. I’ve been making a big effort to show care to him, to listen and to be less self absorbed. I find that everything I do seems to annoy him though. 

Tonight we had a big argument after a night of feeling like I couldn’t speak for fear it would annoy him and it all came out. 

He says I repeat myself too much, I talk about certain topics too much, when I was with his dad recently I asked questions about his physical health to show compassion because he’s struggling and according to my boyfriend that annoyed him because his dad goes on and on about his problems, so why did I do that. I said he’s similar to his dad and that’s annoyed him, because I’ve said it before. He’s said I won’t let him play music in the car I just turn it down and talk, apparently I shouldn’t do that. 

I should add I make him coffee every morning, I make his dinner every day, I listen to all his problems and all his work stuff. But it feels like I can’t do anything right. I just exploded with anger because he said today was all about me and the only good part of the day was when I was napping so he had some peace. 

I worked from 9-4 and had a nap then we spent a couple of hours together watching a movie and I was chatty, but that’s honestly just how I am. But somehow that’s become a day that’s all about me. 

I’m so tired of this and I don’t know what to do. I’m sick of feeling bad about just being me. How do we even move forward from this? ",2,1759528621.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

I’m a 34-year-old guy, married for 14 years, and dad to two amazing kids. I love my family and I’m not looking to disrupt my marriage or anyone else’s. But lately, I’ve been missing that spark of connection — the kind that makes you feel seen, heard, and valued.

I’ve tried hard to fill that void at home, but it hasn’t worked, and I’m realizing how much I’d appreciate someone to talk to. Whether it’s sharing a laugh over our favorite books, swapping playlists of music that gets us through the day, or just joking around the way old friends do — I miss that feeling.

I love being outdoors, whether hiking a trail or just walking with a good cup of coffee in hand. I’m the type who can spend an afternoon digging through record stores or lingering in a cozy coffee shop, just enjoying conversation. Those little joys make life feel brighter, and I’d like to share them with someone who understands what it’s like to crave more connection.

Not necessarily every day, but enough to make the weeks feel less heavy. A little lighthearted flirting here and there would be nice too, if it feels right — nothing over the top, just genuine, fun energy between two people who get it.

I’m not here for drama or crossing big boundaries — just looking for an honest, respectful bond with someone who’s in a similar place.

1nxc2k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Parking_Tiger_9703/comments/1nxc2k6/tommy_and_the_witches/,Tommy and the Witches,"The rain didn’t just fall; it spat, hammered, and hissed against the windowpanes of Number Seven, Willow Lane. It was only seven o’clock on a Friday in November, but the cold, heavy darkness felt ancient, pressing against the glass as if trying to force its way in.

Tommy was tucked beneath his thick, plaid duvet, but no amount of wool could stop the creeping anxiety that tightened his chest whenever the wind howled.

He could hear his mother’s voice, clear as a bell in his memory, her breath smelling of peppermint and coffee. ""Dark nights, son,"" she’d warned with a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes, ""that's when the witches arrive. They fly on the wind and they only take the bad little ones away.""

Tommy, now eight, had spent the last seven Novembers believing this was just a cozy, scary story. But this year, the rain felt louder, the shadows felt deeper, and the terrifying question kept bubbling up: Was he bad enough?

He began a frantic mental inventory of his recent behavior. He had, shamefully, fed his baby sister a crumb of dirt last Sunday, convincing her it was ‘Chocolate Sprinkle Dust.’ He had blamed the cat for scratching the armchair. And just yesterday, he had purposefully given the wrong directions to the confusing old lady who was looking for the post office.

He gasped, pulling the duvet over his nose. That was wickedly bad. That felt like three points right there, maybe enough to qualify for a one-way trip in a rusty sack.

The next blast of wind shook the house, rattling a loose piece of guttering right outside his room. Scratch. Scra-a-atch. It sounded like long, brittle fingernails drawing across the brick.

Tommy squeezed his eyes shut. He imagined them—three of them, bony and hunched, their noses covered in warts, their eyes glowing orange like embers in the pitch black. They’d be here for the Bad Boy of Willow Lane.

He held his breath, listening for the creak of the floorboards outside his door, the rustle of black robes, or the low, hungry humming his mum had always described. The scraping sound came again, closer this time, just by his window. He whimpered, clutching his worn stuffed dragon, Horace.

Suddenly, a loud, familiar sound cut through the storm: the heavy clunk of the front door closing downstairs, followed by the jingle of keys and the cheerful, non-witch-like sound of his father's voice.

“Tommy! I’m home!” his Dad yelled up the stairs, followed by the clatter of a heavy boot. “Hope you saved some of the good biscuits!”

Tommy stayed frozen, listening. The scraping sound stopped. The immediate, suffocating fear began to shrink, replaced by a sudden, immense relief. He realized that the horrible scraping hadn't been a witch's fingernail at all; it was probably just the loose branch of the oak tree outside, whipped by the wind.

He let out the breath he’d been holding. Maybe, he thought, as the warm light from the hallway spilled faintly under his door, maybe the witches were a little bit afraid of Dads. Or maybe, just maybe, they only worked until 7:00 PM on Friday nights.

He decided that tomorrow, he would definitely apologize to the post office lady, just in case they flew a lot slower than his mum let on.",1,1759527718.0,u_Parking_Tiger_9703,0,1.0,False

Harper had never found the Belfry to be particularly scenic. Sure, it loomed high over Gotham, offering a perfect view of the whole city, and sure, it had a distinctive rustic look that was lacking from most of the decaying, greying concrete and steel of the rest of the city. But to her, it felt more out of place than anything; it stuck out like a sore thumb and therefore drew the eye. But, she thought to herself, when it comes to secret bases, beggars can’t exactly be choosers.


Emerging from the elevator, Harper’s gaze met her friend Luke’s, the exact man she had wanted to see. She found him midway through some miscellaneous work on his Batwing suit involving a small screwdriver, and as he looked up and saw Harper, he nodded once in greeting and placed the tool on a nearby table.


“Hey,” greeted Harper.


“I thought you were on patrol,” came his reply. His voice was neutral - not judging or scolding, simply an observation. “Did something happen?”


“I’d have radio’d if something had happened,” Harper said, gesturing to her comms earpiece. “I just wanted to check in with something while Jace is holding the fort.”


“Alright. What did you wanna check?”


Harper drew a deep breath. “Well, I wanted to know if there’s any way to upgrade my suit.”


Luke’s answer came immediately. “Almost definitely, but it’d depend. Upgrade how?”


“I just feel like I’m…” She looked down at her suit. It wasn’t quite the revolutionary mech suit that Luke himself operated, nor was it the sleek design of Jace’s Insider suit, but it served its purpose well - well-placed metal padding around the forearms and chest provided a necessary barrier from projectiles, pockets were installed along a toolbelt at her waist, allowing her to retrieve weapons and tools in no time, and the legs, despite the reduced armour, were padded to allow for both protection and flexibility. But Harper looked down at it and clenched her fists. It wasn’t enough. “I don’t feel like I’m hitting as hard as I should be.”


Luke paused. His eyebrows lowered slowly into a frown.


“Like,” Harper continued. She held up her hands, clothed in fingerless gloves, in a defensive boxing pose. “I feel like I could do a lot more damage if I just had…” She mimicked throwing a punch as an attempt to follow the thought through. “Maybe something to enhance it.”


“Something to enhance it.”


“Yeah.”


“Like what?”


Harper looked at him with annoyance. “Like— I don’t know, I don’t make the suits. I’m just not doing enough damage.”


Luke scratched the back of his neck. “Harper, I’ve seen you fight. You pack a hell of a punch. You sure you’re not—?”


“Actually, while you’re at it,” she interrupted. Her hand ran across a piece of metal padding brandished across her abdomen. “I think there needs to be more padding.”


Luke’s face betrayed his disagreement, but Harper wasn’t looking.


“Yeah, there definitely needs to be more.” Her fingers tapped rhythmically against the metal. Her eyes were fixed on the floor, deep in thought. “Yeah.”


“Harper.”


Finally she looked up.


“What is all this?”


Harper blinked. “What’s what?”


“Where has this come from?”


“I…” She shrugged. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”


“When I gave you the suit, you said it was perfect. You’ve used it for months now with no issue. You’ve fought off super-enhanced criminals and tanked bullets.” He shook his head in disbelief. “But suddenly it’s not good enough.”


“You’re right,” she said suddenly. The words seemed to tumble out of her mouth. She took a step backwards. “It’s fine as it is. Forget it.”


“No, that’s—” Luke closed the gap by taking a step forward. He sighed. “That’s not what I meant. What I’m trying to say is, have you been biting your tongue about this for a while, or has something happened recently?”


Harper said nothing; instead, she chewed on the inside of her cheek.


“Look,” he began. “I think I get what’s going on, because I’ve been through the same thing. Hell, I’m kinda still going through the same thing. Duke has these cool light powers, he can turn invisible. Jace used to be Batman, for God’s sake. And I’m just some guy who lets his suit do all the work.”


Harper scoffed.


“What?”


“You’re far from ‘just some guy’, Luke.” Her words were dripping with bitterness. “You made these fucking suits. If you’re ‘just some guy’, then what does that make me?”


Luke felt as if he had made a breakthrough of some kind, that he had been able to decode why Harper was so upset about the suit. But as he opened his mouth to assuage her, she huffed and turned on her heel. “Whatever. If you can’t fix the suit, you could’ve just said.”


Then, swiveling her head back round, she stormed towards the elevator.

It had been a relatively quiet day for Gotham City in terms of crime, but that wasn’t saying much. Even on quiet days, the Gotham Knights still found themselves rushed off of their feet, it just meant the difference between sticking together and splitting up. It was particularly surprising, therefore, that Harper and Jace had found themselves with enough time to be able to sit for a moment while on patrol.


Harper’s face had been stern and focused all day, but where at first it appeared to be determination, as Jace looked over at her he noticed she seemed more angry, as if something was plaguing her. “Everything go alright with Luke?”


She breathed in and paused. She seemed to be formulating an answer that would ease Jace’s concern. But after a swift exhale, she decided against it. “Not really.”


Jace said nothing but looked at her expectantly. No follow-up comment came, so instead he replied, “Sorry to hear that.”


The wind was mild, thankfully, even as high up as the pair were. A few spots of rain splashed against Insider’s mask with a dull tap sound.


“Tell me more about your Earth,” Harper said, breaking the silence. She picked up a small pebble from the roof of the building and began to fiddle with it, rolling it back and forth between her two palms.


The request caught Jace somewhat off-guard. He had exhausted his repertoire of easily-retrievable, easily-explainable memories, and so he searched his mind for what else to share. “Well,” he began, closing his eyes in thought. “I think I mentioned before that a lot is very similar to this Earth. I never really got too far outside of the Gotham border, so I can’t speak for the rest of the world. It’s still a city that needs saving, that needs help.”


The answer didn’t seem to satisfy Harper. Without looking up, she asked, “You mentioned that you weren’t exactly pals with your Earth’s Harper Row.”


Each of them let the silence grow. They allowed it to be awkward.


“That’s right,” was all Jace could manage.


“But you haven’t told me what she was like.” Harper allowed the stone to tumble out of her hands and fall off of the edge of the building, disappearing from view in its swift descent to the floor. The gentle wind and rainfall, despite its mildness, masked the sound of the stone hitting the ground below. “I’m a big girl, I can take it,” she joked without a smile.


But Jace was troubled by this. He let the comment sit for a moment, weighing up where to start, whether to even entertain the request. But her words had truth: he had been too coy with her for too long, and it seemed to have affected her more than if he had been honest from the start. And so he began to tell her:


“Harper Row as I knew her was an up-and-coming tech manufacturer. She was the owner of a business - pretty big in Gotham, but relatively small for the rest of the country - that mainly specialised in home security. But she had some underground connections. To be honest, I hadn’t quite gotten to the bottom of it by the time I got sent here, but the bottom line is that she had potentially hundreds of people working for her in secret. I’d known for a while that she was operating under a pseudonym - Rewire - and was mobilising these workers to carry out crimes on her behalf. Anything from petty theft to attempted assassinations. But she covered her tracks well, and she’d managed to elude me.”


He looked up at Harper. Her face seemed more relaxed, despite the severity of his words. She listened intensely. “She became a professional thorn in my side,” Jace added half-jokingly, but again Harper did not smile. Instead she just nodded. His story seemed to satisfy her.


“How did she do it?” Harper asked.


“Do what?”


“Not the, like, army of people,” she shook her head. “The business. Being able to balance that and being… well, for lack of a better phrase, a supervillain.” Then she looked at Jace. “How did *you* do it?”


“With difficulty,” he admitted. “For Rewire, I… I’m not really sure. Delegating work, I suppose. You probably know, having been Bluebird for so long, but there isn’t really such a thing as a work-life balance in this profession, as much as we try to make sure there is.” He shrugged. “Something’s always gotta give.”

“We should do this more often,” said Duke cheerfully after an extended period of silence. The coffee shop that Harper and Duke found themselves in was relatively busy, and between baristas calling out names every thirty seconds and the ambient sounds of unintelligible conversation, Duke had to raise his voice somewhat to be heard.


Harper found his comment somewhat amusing. “We’ve just sat down.”


“I know,” Duke said with a smile. “It’s just… we don’t usually do this kind of thing.”


Harper knew he was right, but she couldn’t help feeling a smidge of guilt; they had been friends for a few years, and yet she could count the amount of times they had met up as Harper and Duke (and not Bluebird and the Signal) on one hand. And not only that, she had come to him as a form of comfort, as someone to confide in, and as she sat leafing through what she wanted to say in her head, she felt the guilt growing and growing. Would she come off as manipulative, bringing him here under the guise of a friendly conversation only to vent to him? Or was that just what friends do?


“Harper?”


Her head snapped back to face him. She wasn’t sure how long she had been staring into the middle distance for. “Oh, sorry.”


“All good, but… are you okay?”


Harper hated how easy she was to read at times. “I’ve been better.”


Duke thought for a moment and Harper took the opportunity to take a sip from her coffee cup. “Is this about the whole ‘evil you’ thing?”


Astounded by his laser precision, Harper paused. “Yeah, kinda.”


Duke bobbed his head sideways, a kind of half-nod. “That makes sense.”


“It does?”


“You found out that an alternate universe version of yourself is some kind of evil mastermind. I’d be way more concerned about you if you *weren’t* upset.”


She exhaled through her nose.


“But what about it?”


After another long sip from her cup, Harper pondered his question. “It’s that, but it’s also something else.” She straightened her back. “For a while, I’ve been feeling… out of place. On the team, I mean.”


“Out of place how?”


“You’ve got Jace, the former Batman, expert at stealth. There’s Luke, tech expert. There’s you, superpowered heavy hitter. And then there’s me…” Her shoulders slouched.


Duke stared at her, then filled in the gap: “... the planner. The mechanic. The one who knows every in and out of a place just from being there once.”


She scoffed.


“I’m serious.”


“Okay, so I can get into a vent,” she said, raising her hands defensively. “That’s clearly the same as shooting light beams out of my hands.”


“Don’t be like that,” Duke scolded. “Just because you don’t have powers doesn’t mean—”


“Yeah, but Jace doesn’t have powers. Neither does Luke.” Her leg bounced up and down nervously. “Luke even tried to make me feel better, y’know, by telling me that he also feels that way, feels inferior. Luke Fox, of all people.” She laughed humorlessly. “You know the first thing I thought when Jace told me I was this big businessman on his Earth? How this version of me used to go toe to toe with Batman?”


Duke only stared.


“‘How the hell do I do that? How do I get that powerful?’”


“Harper—”


“But then I realised, surely the only way to do that is to be cruel, right? You can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. So either my options are to carry on being Bluebird the way that I am, constantly on the backfoot… or break some eggs.” She ran her hands over her face. “And I don’t wanna do either.”


The young barista with a tiger tattoo emblazoned across his arm called out the name Jacob. The milk steamer hissed and bubbled in the distance.


“Do you remember when we were first starting out?” Duke recalled. “How reluctant you were to be a hero. I literally came to your house and convinced you to do it, to work as a team. It’s because I knew you were born for this. You were - and are - really good at this. I mean, jeez, just recently you were *the* reason we stopped Gnomon and Lock-Up from escaping the Harvey Dent facility.” But Harper wasn’t moved. At least, she wasn’t showing it. “You used to be so determined to be a hero. What changed?”


“Everything else, seemingly,” she remarked plainly. “Everyone else is getting better, growing into being a hero, but it feels like I’ve stayed the same.”



&nbsp;

&nbsp;


The front door to the Row’s apartment clicked back into the latch and Harper let out a low groan of exhaustion. Her colleagues, her friends, had given her a lot to think about, but it felt as though she was no closer to a solution. She didn’t even know what she wanted, really. All she knew for certain was how inferior she felt, how hard she had to work to keep up with her friends, and how it seemed like - if she kept going down this path, if she kept pushing herself harder and harder - that eventually either something would have to give, or she would be forced to make sacrifices.


From down the corridor, the squeak of Cullen’s door opening snapped her from her trance.


“Hey, bud,” she said softly. The moonlight pouring into the room cast a harsh light on his face, the other half clouded by darkness.


“Late shift again?” His voice was croaky from sleep.


“Yeah.”


“Yeah.” Cullen rubbed his eye.


“Listen, can we talk about this?” Harper asked.


“Talk about what?”


“Sit down.” She gestured to the sofa in front of her. Leaning over to the corner of the room, she gently yanked a pull cord attached to a dusty-coloured lamp, which flickered to life. With hesitance, Cullen obeyed her request.


Harper didn’t realise until she was seated but her heart was thumping. She looked at her brother with kindness in her eyes, trying to meet his gaze through his mop of dyed black hair.


“I know I haven’t been around much,” she began. She fidgeted with her hands. “I’m sorry that me being Bluebird has taken away so much time together.”


“Harper, stop,” Cullen interrupted. Frustrated, he rubbed his hand across his forehead and closed his eyes. “Frankly, if you were that sorry, you’d stop.”


“It’s not that easy, Cul,” she attempted to soothe.


“Isn’t it? There’s enough people in Gotham running around playing dress up. You barely have any spare time away from it. And any spare time you *do* have, you’re spending it at the gym, so it’s like I’m not even close to top priority. This can't be healthy.”


“I’m sorry,” was all she could manage.


“No you’re not, though.” He raised his voice, incredulous. “Harper, I need my sister back.”


The words were a knife in Harper’s heart. She moved her hand to grab Cullen’s and, although he flinched his hand back at first, he allowed her hand to wrap around his.


“I’m old enough to get a job,” he added, his voice softer. “And we need the money. So that means potentially more time that we won’t get to see each other.” His hand squeezed against his sister’s. “And I barely sleep. I’m always worried you won’t come home.”


“We talked about this, buddy, when I first told you what I was doing.”


“I know,” he sighed. “But it’s one thing *telling* me you’re always gonna be here, and it’s another thing *showing* me.” Cullen sniffed. “I didn't know what I was signing up for until it happened.”


“I'll talk to the others,” Harper promised. “I'm sure they'd understand. It's just… I can't drop this entirely. I'm trying to do a lot of good for a lot of people.”


Cullen looked at her, despondent. Defeated. “Do what you want. You said you wanted to talk about it, we've talked about it.” He rose from his seat. “But at the end of the day, I can't force you to do something you don't want to do.”


“Cullen—”


But he was already halfway to his room. By the time Harper had risen to her feet to follow him, his door had already slammed shut. And all of a sudden, her problem had become even more complex.

1nxbt80,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nxbt80/being_myself_has_never_worked_out_for_me/,Being myself has never worked out for me.,"This is something I have never told anyone before, mainly because everyone says that's the best way of living, but, as the title suggests, it has never quite worked out for me. I'm 23, never cared what others thought about me (not even in the slightest) until very recently. I always asked kids to play with me when I was a kid, and they never wanted to. Mainly because I wanted to play board games instead of videogames and running around. They always played with the other kids though. Never cared about it, just kept asking and played by myself. I got into the Scouts of my country (I realized they are apparently different) lasted for about three years there. They never gave me one thing you're supposed to put on your neck to kind of know you belong there. Never actually cared and stopped going just because I got bored of it. Never had any friends, no one I ever wanted to talk to would talk to me, and ended up talking and befriending people I didn't even liked or felt like befriending just because they were the ones who talked to me. Never cared about it ""I'd just talk to someone else. There's plenty of fish"" I thought. Then I hit highschool, same thing happens. Went to talk to the metalheads (because I liked metal at the time) and they treated me so horribly because i asked ONCE to listen to some Maroon 5 song. Wanted to form a band, no one ever wanted to, maybe because I would randomly want to play jazz and then some heavy metal when I felt like it, and no one was really fond of that. Never cared. Had no friends. Then I hit college, and I guess you're seeing the pattern here. Always end up talking to the same people (ones I don't even want to talk to or befriend) and the people I want to talk to just don't talk back to me. There's just one difference: this time I actually care, and it's killing me inside. I just go and talk to the people I like, but I started to realize they never actually liked me back, it didn't matter how much I felt like I belonged somewhere, I never did, and not because I didn't felt like it, but because the other people never felt like it. 

Yes, I did go to therapy, if you're going to suggest that, for approximately four or five years; never helped me in any way. Quite the opposite, actually. I always made the effort to change and be different and the best version of myself, even though I always felt like therapy did nothing for me; maybe I was wrong and it actually was doing something for me. Whenever they felt like we weren't making any progress, they made me someone else's problem (other therapist's). I never even stopped going by myself because they were the ""profesionals"" that were supposed to know when i would be good to go. The problem with them was always the same ""I feel like the people I like don't like me back"" they would just tell me ""be yourself"" or make me get to that conclusion by myself or just the ""Therapy-thing"" and I always thought ""ditch, I am already being myself"". I actually told one therapist that, and that was when she deiced to not attend me anymore. I stopped going when I realized the contradiction in all of that. 

Whenever I talk to anyone about this, they just say ""go to therapy"" or something of that sort. I always decline, not becase I don't think It doesn't work (it does) but because I, personally, don't feel like needing it. If I end up taking therapy, it would be because of what others think, and not because I am being true to myself. The thing is, recently I've been feeling like I am the one that's wrong, maybe the problem is exactly that: I am too true to myself.
I never cared for what other people thought, about their feelings towards me or things like that. Never cared if the Scouts saw me as one of them, because I felt like I was one of them. Maybe it has always been supposed to be backwards. I have literally never cared about what others think, believe, feel towards me or things like that, so I don't usually care to show people they're wrong, they're contradicting themselves, they're being foolish, childish or overall incoherent. If I find that something is contradictory in anything, I pretty much just say it. People usually get mad and that sort of stuff: never cared, until very recently, when I looked up at my own life and relationships, and realized how actually lonely I am, how less of a person I feel like. Everyone gets a lot of friends that appreciate each other's quirks. Is it mine too difficult to appreciate? Is it being too true to myself scary? I dress how I feel like, without really caring if it fits into something or not. If I end up hanging around the goths (I did) because I genuinely liked them, I didn't dressed like them, wich led them to stop talking to me. Same thing happened with the metalheads. It genuinely confuses me, everyone says ""just be yourself"" but that has just gotten me loneliness and pain (recently), making me feel like some wierd thing that doesn't really fit anywhere nor with anyone. Like I am just floating around, always in the middle of everything ""too normal"" for the wierd and quirky people but ""too wierd"" for the ""normal"" people. Too ""mentally stable"" to feel like I don't need therapy but just enough ""fucked up"" to make people think I need it. too ""mentally stable"" to not fall into toxic relationships but too ""fucked up"" to not have a normal one. Worst thing? I used to feel good about it, but now it is driving me insane. I already told why. And yes, I do know how to be alone, but when you're alone all the time you realize how ""social"" things really are, whether it is a concert, shopping, going for a coffee, working, etc.,  
Picture yourself waking up to no messages on your phone, going to your job, working without actually talking to anyone about anything or having any human interaction whatsoever, then going home without any human interaction, buying a ticket without human interaction, going to a concert without human interaction (yes, not even the one from the artist in question. Imagine just him playing music, without acknowledging you whatsoever, in an empty stadium. No autographs after or any interaction whatsoever) then going back home without any human interaction whatsoever, playing some online videogames without any human interaction. Rinse and repeat. 

But maybe that's my problem, I am way too true to myself. ",2,1759527075.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1nxbsoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_redboxrx/comments/1nxbsoh/best_foods_drinks_for_premature_ejaculation/,Best Foods & Drinks for Premature Ejaculation,"Following a healthy and balanced diet improves your overall health in more ways than one. It only makes sense that consuming certain foods and drinks could help improve your performance in bed.

[Premature ejaculation](https://redboxrx.com/services/mens-health/premature-ejaculation) (PE) is a common but complicated condition that can stem from physical and psychological issues. Finding ways to improve your overall health, including food and drink, could be one of the methods that help you overcome sexual dysfunction.

Learn about the science behind treating PE and which treatment options you might want to try.

# Key Takeaways

* Certain nutrient-rich foods like spinach, chocolate, watermelon and strawberries may help improve sexual performance by supporting nitric oxide, serotonin and blood flow.
* Alcohol may worsen premature ejaculation (PE).
* Diet alone usually isn’t enough. Proven options such as topical desensitizers, SSRIs, PDE5 inhibitors, pelvic-floor exercises and other behavioral techniques offer stronger, individualized results.

# Can certain foods or drinks help men last longer in bed?

Research is limited on the connection between specific foods and men’s sexual health. However, there are some associations between ingredients in certain foods and drinks that could improve sexual performance.^(1)

For example, nitric oxide improves blood flow and is a crucial component of a functional erection. This is one of the ways that popular PDE5 inhibitors medications, like [generic Viagra®](https://redboxrx.com/treatments/sildenafil), work for premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction.^(2) Foods or drinks that increase nitric oxide could potentially help men last longer in bed, although more research is needed.

# Can certain foods or drinks cause premature ejaculation or make it worse?

While there is not reliable research to show that certain foods or drinks cause premature ejaculation, there is a correlation between drinking alcohol and male sexual dysfunction.^(3)

# Top five foods to consider for PE

[Top 5 foods to consider for premature ejaculation \(PE\)](https://preview.redd.it/d2l3fb4dsysf1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcd762cd38754ab3b6673c1059d52c86e8558cf1)

**1. Spinach**

Spinach can help raise nitric oxide levels, which is important in blood flow and maintaining erections.^(4) Also, it is rich in testosterone-boosting magnesium.^(5) Low levels of magnesium have been linked to premature ejaculation in some research.^(6)

**2. Chocolate**

Chocolate has been shown to raise serotonin levels in the brain. However, some research suggests that the protein in chocolate may negate the effects.^(7) The SSRI antidepressants ([sertraline](https://redboxrx.com/treatments/sertraline-for-pe), [paroxetine](https://redboxrx.com/treatments/paroxetine-for-pe)), often prescribed for PE, work by increasing serotonin levels as well.^(8)

**3. Watermelon**

Watermelon can help relax blood flows for better circulation due to its abundance in the amino acid, citrulline. Increasing blood flow is one way that prescriptions help treat PE.^(9)

**4. Strawberries**

The high levels of vitamin C in strawberries could ease anxiety, a common psychological trigger of PE. There is some evidence to support that vitamin C could boost libido and blood flow.^(10)

**5. Ginger**

While research making a direct correlation between ginger and PE is still needed, ginger has been proven to increase blood flow^(11) and reduce blood pressure.^(12) Both of which could improve PE.

# Top three drinks to consider for PE

[Top three drinks to consider for premature ejaculation \(PE\)](https://preview.redd.it/vsr3vuxosysf1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e37f65dae2b3637bd129cc151ce887104717bc6)

**1. Pomegranate juice**

According to health experts, drinking antioxidant-rich pomegranate juice can increase blood flow, raise testosterone levels and boost mood.^(13)

**2. Coffee or tea**

Coffee and tea are packed with antioxidants, which are good for your overall health. Caffeine from coffee or tea can perk up your nervous system for better bedroom performance.^(14)

**3. Water**

Water is essential to a wide variety of bodily functions. Dehydration, even mild, can lead to an increase in anxiety and fatigue, which can affect sexual performance.^(15) Blood pressure can also dip or spike due to dehydration.^(16)

# Alternatives to help you last longer in bed

[Alternatives to help you last longer in bed](https://preview.redd.it/gwvfteovsysf1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=36c3462abca765f47c837bcd4225b691b66ee8fe)

If you are looking for [PE treatment that is clinically supported](https://redboxrx.com/blog/compare-premature-ejaculation-treatments-pills-creams-wipes-explained), there are alternatives to trying specific foods and drinks that will help you last longer in bed.

**Topicals**

Topical PE treatments are applied directly to the male genitals before sexual contact and help dull sensation. Topicals come in various forms, including creams, wipes and sprays. Examples include [lidocaine cream](https://redboxrx.com/treatments/lidocaine) and benzocaine wipes.

Generally, the product is applied five to 20 minutes before sex and can help delay ejaculation by three to six minutes.^(17)

**SSRIs**

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are antidepressants that increase certain neurotransmitters in the brain that help delay ejaculation.^(18) In one study, 100 men were given one of three SSRIs to take daily for four weeks. One hundred percent of the men in the study reported improved PE symptoms.^(19)

Commonly prescribed SSRIs for PE include [sertraline (Zoloft®)](https://redboxrx.com/treatments/sertraline-for-pe) and [paroxetine (Paxil®)](https://redboxrx.com/treatments/paroxetine-for-pe).

**PDE5 inhibitors**

PDE5 inhibitors are a class of medications approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. PDE5 inhibitors relax blood vessels and improve blood flow, which can help achieve erections and make erections last longer. In some studies, there were both physical and psychological benefits to using PDE5 inhibitors in the treatment of PE, including reduced performance anxiety and lowering the level of arousal to last longer.^(20)

Using an SSRI in conjunction with a PDE5 inhibitor is even more effective than using just one alone.^(21)

[Sildenafil (Viagra®)](https://redboxrx.com/treatments/sildenafil), [tadalafil (Cialis®)](https://redboxrx.com/treatments/tadalafil) and [vardenafil (Levitra®)](https://redboxrx.com/treatments/vardenafil) are commonly prescribed PDE5 inhibitors for PE.

# Nonmedication treatments

Treatment options for PE expand beyond food, drink and medication. You may find a combination of treatments works best for you.

**Behavioral techniques**

One technique to try is masturbating one to two hours before intercourse. This may help delay orgasm during sexual contact with a partner. Alternatively, you can try sexual contact that doesn’t include intercourse to ease the pressure of performance.^(22)

**Pelvic floor exercises**

Strengthening the pelvic floor muscles, also known as Kegels, can offer more control over ejaculation. These exercises involve flexing and releasing the same muscles used to urinate.^(23)

**Condoms**

Condoms reduce sensitivity, which can help delay ejaculation. Some brands are designed to delay climax with thicker latex or numbing agents like benzocaine or lidocaine.^(24)

I'm a college student who primarily eats in the cafeteria at designated meal times. I don't have a lot of choices overall since that's where I get all of my food, but they still have a good selection that's there. I usually only eat at lunch and dinner because breakfast is from 7-9 and I usually don't want to get out that early. Well, recently I've been going for breakfast too.

These past few days I just can't stay below my calories. I was doing pretty good at first. I lost 17 lbs in 1.5 months, by walking and eating in a 400-1,000 calorie deficit each day. (Maintenance is ~3,000). But I still genuinely don't understand how people can eat ~2,000 calories per day.

Here is what I ate today: for breakfast, I had 2 biscuits with white gravy, some slices of bacon, a small portion of powdered eggs, and 8oz of orange juice. For lunch, I had some brisket and baked beans, and I had some coffee with a little (like 4 tsp) of creamer and unsweetened coconut almond milk for a snack. My app says this is over my 2,000 calorie budget even though it doesn't seem like it. Like maybe it is. But so many meals that aren't these things also go above it other days too.

I count calories every day, but some things I can't scan a barcode for so I have to search for the food and guess which to put it under. And so I don't always know what is right. I dont want to overestimate and starve, or underestimate and overeat. I'm stressed. I have overrate for 5 days in a row by 40-700 calories (700 only once, other times below 400).

Keep in mind that after what I've already eaten, I'm hungry still. It's only a little past 4 PM. Every time I eat breakfast I overeat, and I don't know why I can't stay full. Why am I still hungry if I eat breakfast? Is it portion control, is that why I overeat? Because when I think of people who look how I want to look and who don't worry about counting calories, I feel like the portion I am eating would be a reasonable amount for anyone, but apparently not. And why are biscuits and gravy like 900 calories?!

Now, I have been doing things like loading up on vegetables when I can. I usually wat a chicken sandwich since they usually have it and I get it anytime they do, which when I log is about 450 calories. I load up on lettuce, and because pickles are so low calorie I've been eating lots of those. But also, it's like I always want to eat?

I don't know what I'm asking. Many things. Why is it hard to feel full for the day when I choose to eat breakfast? What are some low calorie things to add to my meals to make them bigger and me fuller? I don't even know what exercises to do to help with fat loss, never been my thing. What are some good tips for foods to avoid? Do I have to avoid biscuits and gravy forever? Someone help please.",1,1759526969.0,diet,2,1.0,False
1nxbqp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1nxbqp5/m4f_help_me_fall_in_love_again/,[M4F] Help Me Fall In Love Again…,"Hello online world; charming, tall, fit, and slightly awkward teacher here. I am getting out of a long term relationship and now looking to rekindle my love for role play by finding some incredible partners. I have a few specific ideas I would love to explore. I love slice of life ideas; especially when there are obstacles in the way that the characters have to navigate. I also love a slow burn where characters go from friends to lovers despite what might be keeping them apart. 

Within the roleplay I want to get to know our characters intimately and also discover each other by putting a bit of ourselves in our characters. I would also love to chat and get to know the person behind the character as well long term.

Here’s my main prompt I’m interested in:
We were inseparable growing up; ever since we walked across the crosswalk on the first day of kindergarten. We couldn’t be more different; yet similar. We both had a deep curiosity for the world, a love of people, and a weird since of humor. Yet you had all the confidence in the world growing up and I had none. As we got into middle school you got into makeup, makeouts, and cheer practice. I could barely talk to a girl so I focused on science and animals which always made way more sense to me. As we got into high school I would tutor you as we had Friday night study dates before the game while you would teach me how to not make a complete fool of myself talking to girls. We would spend late nights on the roof talking about our hopes, dreams, and fears. We both wanted to escape town and chase our dreams. As the bubbly, cute, and outgoing cheer captain you wanted to chase fame and fortune but your family was everything to you. My family was never like yours so I wanted to find success and finally be seen for my genius. 

What I never told you was that I was in love with you until the night I told you everything. I asked you to meet me at our coffee shop and you never arrived. I was blown off for the starting quarterback. I then chased a career in science and never looked back. I would check on you from time to time and despite dating other girls you were the only one for me. Years later I move back to find my roots and give back as a teacher. I have changed a lot thanks to an extremely successful science startup. Through starting a business I’ve changed and grown fit, social, charming, and confident. I found success, women, and money but yet it was never enough. After a messy divorce I move back to my hometown to rediscover myself and you have to do the same. I would love to explore obstacles in the way like both of us changing but we bring out ourselves again, your parents perhaps, your husband or boyfriend, and all the years that have passed. 

I also would be interested in two friends that dated and married the wrong people and glory and have stayed friends and slowly those boundaries fall away.

If you would be interested let me know as I’d love to find a long term partner to fall in love with roleplaying again.",1,1759526902.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

So I did, and I'm having trouble.","I been on Adderall XR for 6 years, 5-6 days a week, started at 5mg and within the first year found that 20mg was working for me. 

This past year, I've noticed that the 20mg was too much. Within the first couple hours of taking the pill, I was jittery, irritable, locked in, and uncontrollably energized. 

About 2-3 months ago I went down to 15mg. It was a lot better, I would still get a little jittery some mornings. I was a lot calmer through out the day as well. 

Last week, I went down to 10mg. 
My desire to lower my dosage and potentially get off meds drives from my fear of the long term effects on my health and my plan to move to a country that doesn't supply these types of drugs. I am also very tired of my 'morning energy spike'.

The transition to 15mg was A LOT easier than to 10mg. It does almost feel like the 10mg is a placebo, just get a mild version of the morning energy. I find myself may more fatigued, zoning out when people talk, less motivated, I'm more forgetful, a little less observant and my perception just feels hazy. While on 15mg, I could see and think like a clear straight tunnel - but I felt my body to be too energized. 

There's good changes with 10mg - I'm not over thinking before speaking, I feel a lot more comfortable talking to people, I'm a lot calmer and my reactions are slower and more authentic, my mind is wandering A LOT more but it's productive sometimes, I'm not anxious or worried about things that usually make feel anxious and I can finally drink coffee again without headaches! 

Its been only a week on 10mg, I'm nervous about these changes, they remind me of how I was before I was medicated. 
My tolerance was high, will it lower the longer I take this dosage? Will I get over this hump of not really feeling anything? I'm not quite ready for a new normal this big yet, but my body feels a lot better. Has anyone had similar experiences? ",1,1759526782.0,ADHD,5,1.0,False

Hey there,

I’m looking to connect with someone genuine who enjoys good conversation, laughter, and building a real connection. Friendship is always the starting point, but I’m open to seeing where things can naturally go whether that’s just good company, something casual, or eventually more.

A little about me: I’m 33, 5’10”, athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. People would describe me as laid back, sarcastic in the best way, and always down to laugh. My work keeps me busy with odd hours, but I actually enjoy the flexibility it gives me. I can travel and usually work around different schedules pretty easily.

When it comes to interests, I’m all about the outdoors during spring, summer, and fall whether that’s hiking, camping, being out on the water, or just a long walk with good company. In the colder months I switch gears and keep it cozy with reading, cooking, binging shows, or relaxing with coffee and good conversation. I also really value physical connection and quality time. It’s my way of feeling close to someone.

I’m hoping to meet someone who’s fun, witty, playful, and open minded. Consistency matters to me, and I’d love to find someone who enjoys both the silly side of things and the deeper conversations. Someone who’s not afraid of a little sarcasm, loves to laugh, and appreciates genuine connections.

If this sounds like your vibe, send me a message. I’d be glad to get to know you.

About me:

I'm 30, female, 5ft6, heterosexual, of southern african descent and I work full time. I moved from the Midlands about a year and a half ago and have been loving it since.

Still trying to get over it a year later honestly:

[https://wstray.substack.com/p/an-empty-apartment](https://wstray.substack.com/p/an-empty-apartment)

So, I’m in the apartment, talking with my girlfriend. We’ve been living together for the last year. She told me the taxi guy’s coming in an hour. We’d had endless amounts of time, and then suddenly we had one hour left. What do we do now? Let’s go and get another coffee, which is very Balkan.

We’re sitting there, we’re talking, and I see a guy walking on top of a car - another random Balkan thing I would soon no longer be seeing as well. And all the time I’m thinking, this is maybe the last coffee we’ll ever have. It felt a bit like how someone might feel on death row, if this was going to be the last meal they ever have.

So, I get into the car, and one of the last things she says to me is,’*I am going to see you again, right?’* And I say, ‘*yeah, we’ll see each other again soon.’* It’s been five months since I said that. I haven’t seen her since then. *That place I called home a year ago today is just a memory now.*

I moved in the summer of 2024, and she had spent time getting everything prepared, putting things in. I opened the door, and it was the first time in my life I thought I’d lived in a nice apartment. I lived in a 12-square-meter hellhole in Japan. I lived in a really horrible apartment in Canada, mouse-infested, bed bug infestation, and cold. *All my previous apartments had been horrible.* Everything there had been so prepared - pictures, framed photos, attention to detail. She put so much effort into the design, getting the Beatles photo, and then by the time I was leaving, the things had been taken down. I don’t know if there’s anything more heart-breaking than taking down the framed photo of us two together she’d put up there.

I’m not going to pretend every single second in the apartment was enjoyable. It wasn’t. But it was my place with a balcony, and it had a feel to it - a kitchen, clean, everything relatively modern, everything worked, two bathrooms. We had a little life together. A life that involved going to many, many different coffee shops, breakfast places, and being together almost all the time. A small life. But it was also one of the most stabilizing times in my life.That’s what I really wanted: to have someone close to me who cared about me, and who I was connected to.

Now it’s all just memories, almost as if it never happened. It was the worst professional year I’ve ever had. I was into alcohol and other addictions, really into all my addictions, so obviously something was wrong, or else I wouldn’t have done that. But there was a good foundation there, symbolized by the apartment. And I miss it. That’s all I can say.

The thing is, I think all the time about how sad that was, but I was in the taxi. I was going to the airport. She had to walk back into the empty apartment when I was not there. She had to face that reality of, it’s actually over. I got to escape that reality. She had to face it and put everything back in the boxes, and take everything back to her parents’ house. That’s even worse than the memories I described.

I remember not wanting to be in the room when another couple came to see the place. Just the thought of them enjoying *my* balcony was upsetting. Sometimes I am comforted by the idea the spirit of our time together lives on in that room somehow. Perhaps that makes me believe that there’s a permanence from that time period.",2,1759526415.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

Staring at my screen,

the deep marine green,

with the outskirts of Prussian Blue.

My Hands are icky,

my forehead is sticky,

my eyes are glazed.

and ever advancing.

Is the bleep.

I smell my fear,

and my workmates stale beer,

my captains perfume

and ever advancing. Is the bleep.

I cry out in fear,

My captain,forward spear,

To my workstation

and ever advancing. Is the bleep.

My captain swears at the radar

The palpable tension with the USSR

Bellow at my screen

but we cannot halt the

ever advancing. Is the bleep.

The pressure goes up

my fingers tighten on my coffee cup

as we stare out onto the blue

we reach and touch the sea

bow to the sun and feel nothing

the sun burst our skin

the captains hat pin

the empty space

the great planes of sea and sky

the only place to live and die

with water clouds and clouds water

the sand whispers to me

telling me the great tome

seaweed on the roof of the blue

fish sneer at me

gossip at me

frolic about me

talk about me

the lamp of the sun illuminating me

tucking me in

informing my next of kin

and ever advancing. Is the bleep.//",3,1759526382.0,PoetryWritingClub,1,1.0,False

1nxbg6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1nxbg6o/newbie_advice_please/,Newbie advice please,"Hi all,

Over the last 10-20 years or so, I (<50m) have seen my GP (NHS England) god knows how many times for headaches, tiredness, brain fog, hives, rashes, stomach issues etc etc . From all of those visits about each individual symptom none of the episodes have resulted in anything that's helped or made sense. Nobody has connected any dots between each visit or symptom.   

About 6 weeks ago I spotted histamine intolerance somewhere (maybe Reddit), and suddenly all these individual symptoms clicked in to one thing. I visited my GP about it who, sensibly, wanted to start at the beginning and do full blood tests, gluten etc but all were clear (except gout which I've already painfully known about for years).   

At the same time the GP did a blood pressure check, the first in >10 years, 170/100, not great, could be worse. As a result I switched to a healthier diet, coffee was swapped to green tea, the chicken & bacon sandwich for lunch became whole wheat pasta with homemade pesto (basil, garlic, pine nuts), lots of garlic green beans with dinner... And my intolerance symptoms went through the roof! The irony of being intolerant to a healthy diet lol.   

On the plus side, I think I'm closing in on the intolerance. I've learnt about Salicylate intolerance, that seems to fit with the green tea/basil/pine nuts? Maybe there are other related intolerances I don't know about? I have no idea about any of this.   

I'm hoping people who have experienced similar before can advise where to go next? I know there's some intolerance there, but I have no idea what. If I went private is there some speciality I should ask for who can run a bunch of specific tests while avoiding snake oil? Is there any trial and error method that works? Any supplements to try to narrow things down (I bought DAO already when I thought it was histamine but haven't taken it yet as the above seems to have changed my opinion to Salicylate)?   

My current ""best"" plan is to live off chicken and boiled white potatoes until I'm ""level"" and reintroduce things. Even then I don't think I'll really know unless I drink 10 pints of green tea a day to fill the bucket to overflowing. Please tell me there's a quicker way to figure out specifically what it is? Or at least provide some experience of how to narrow it down from where I'm at so I know what to avoid.

Lavender, 
Mint,

Hello everyone,
I’m 28 years old and looking forward to meeting someone special. If you’re interested in going out for coffee, dinner, or just a nice walk to get to know each other, I’d be happy to connect and arrange a date.

Over the past six to eight months, my thyroid meds have been triggering what I think is acid reflux. I haven’t ever had it in my life. I take my meds at 4:45 then go back to sleep til 6 so I can drink coffee after I wake up. I had nearly a month straight where, as soon as I took my medication, I would feel burning in my throat. It went away after that for a while and then was just intermittent once every few weeks having an issue where I felt this burning.

This morning I took my meds and felt the worst burning ever. My ears hurt, my chest hurt, and it felt like I had a rock stuck in my esophagus. It lasted for hours and was so painful. 

This literally only happens when I take the medication. I’ve never had acid reflux otherwise. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Does anyone have any recommendations for things for me to look into or any other ideas? ",1,1759525611.0,Hashimotos,2,1.0,False

INT. MEAN BEAN COFFEE CAFÉ - Night

The shop is empty. Rockwell enters through the door, holding a note in her hand.

Stone is wiping a coffee mug. He looks up and notices Rockwell approach the counter.

STONE \
Hi! What can I get you?

ROCKWELL \
Cut the act, Stone! Why'd you call me here?

STONE \
(Reiterating with more emphasis) \
What can I get you?

Rockwell sighs and glances at her note

ROCKWELL \
(Annoyed) \
Latte with steamed Austrian goat milk.

Suddenly the entire café TRANSFORMS. Metallic shutters cover the windows and the wall behind Stone flips revealing computers and various Robotnik gadgets. Rockwell is somewhat impressed.

ROCKWELL \
Okay. Why did you call me here?

STONE \
We'd like to ask you some questions, Director Rockwell

ROCKWELL \
You and Robotnik? I thought he was dead

STONE \
I wasn't talking about Robotnik

ROCKWELL \
Then who's we?

Suddenly, Shadow TELEPORTS behind Rockwell, grabs her by her collar and throws her across the café.

Rockwell lands on the floor with her back to the front wall. She softly groans in pain and struggles to sit up as Shadow TELEPORTS in front of her.

SHADOW \
Let's start simple.

Shadow walks towards Rockwell. CLOSE UP on Shadow's face.

SHADOW (CONTD.) \
Where do I come from?

Nightmare on Main Street debuts their Haunted House for the 2025 Halloween season starting on Friday, October 3, 2025 and continuing every Friday and Saturday night through Saturday, November 1, 2025. Welcome to Nightmare on Main Street, where the familiar becomes fear and every corner hides a new terror. By day, this small-town street looks like any other, but once the sun sets, something sinister awakens.

The appearance is coincidentally timed with the arrival of a cute new boy at school and her father’s latest scheme to connect with aliens. Blending humor and heart, the play explores science, belief, and finding your place in the universe. Tickets may be purchased online, by phone or by visiting the Center for the Arts at Virginia Tech ticket office in person. Tickets will be available at the door in the Squires Student Center beginning one hour prior to the performance.

Clay’s latest project, Comedy to the Rescue, is the culmination of his years working in animal welfare and those in stand-up comedy. The tour spans the country raising money for all sizes and types of animal charities. The 50/50 Raffle Tickets will be on sale for $5.00 each or five for $20.00.

1nxb3fy,https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1nxb3fy/dont_die_from_the_lack_of_sleep_11_steps_to/,Don't Die From The Lack of Sleep: 11 Steps to Maximize the Quality and Duration of Your Sleep Tonight!,"In the [12 Essential Pillars of Longevity](https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1l2gpfl/12_necessary_steps_to_live_to_120_the_law_of/) we’ve discussed before, SLEEP is number one in the physical subgroup for a good reason - it creates MOTIVATION to do everything else in thee list. 

Here's what I got from ""*Why We Sleep*"" by Matthew Walker, ""*Science of Sleep*"" by Heather Darwall-Smith and my own experiments, which moved the needle from  60-70% sleep to 80-90% range if you prefer to watch or listen: [**12 Step ""CAKE"" Sleep System (DEEP DIVE)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9-4DlyqJeQ&list=PLq4OOzo28fwwsn77UgpKJmluHkJYW3L7v&index=1) 

**or TL;DW Summary:**

Good sleep is like a *red velvet cake*. It has layers and ingredients, but the magic happens when you bake it \_correctly\_. 

So, here’s how to mix and bake your own “sweet velvet dream” cake.

**1. Cool Bedrooms, Warm Blankets**

Do you sleep better in a hot, sweaty room or under a warm blanket in a cool room?

If you’re like me - it’s the cool room every time. Science backs this up: your core temperature needs to drop slightly (1-2 F) for deep sleep. (alsmot like a ""*hibernation*"")

Think of your bedroom like a bear’s den: cozy, but not roasting. Whether it’s winter or summer, adjust that thermostat, but don’t freeze your butt off - just tip the scales slightly toward the chilly side.

**2. Lights Out**

Imagine our ancestors sleeping under the stars - no buzzing streetlights, no screens.   
Moder problem: light, especially blue or green light, tricks your brain into thinking it’s daytime. Daytime means more cortisol (stress hormone) and less melatonin (sleeep hormone).

Even the tiniest sliver of brightness can wake your inner caveman. Sothe goal is to use the dimmest possible nightlight for midnight bathroom trips. (I use blackout curtains and tape all leds in bedroom)

[**f.lux**](https://justgetflux.com/) is a useful software to install on a PC/laptop if you use it in the evening to shift thee screen into red hue.  Smart bulbs getting redder and dimmer is a good idea too.

**3. Wake Up to the Morning Light**

On the flip side, think of sunlight as your wake-up coffee.

Ever wonder why you can “see” sunlight even with your eyes closed? Your brain’s light-sensitive.   
So when morning comes - open those curtains and soak in some daylight. That going to kickstart your internal clock AKA circadian rhythms.

**4. Smartphones**

Here’s the thing - **doom-scrolling Reddit at midnight isn’t a recognized sleep aid.**

Your phone is like that annoying friend who keeps poking your brain for attention. The light and stress keep your amygdala (brain’s danger sensor) on high alert. And as a precaution you sleep becomes much ligheter...  (danger = minimize deep sleep)

The ""hack"" - is to get a dedicated alarm clock or flip phone and let the trolls and notifications wait until morning.

**5. Stress Loops and Overthinking**

Ever stayed awake replaying an unfinished argument or the ""perfect"" comeback you should’ve used?

Your brain loves to loop these thoughts like a broken record.

The trick? [Micro-Journaling](https://youtu.be/o07-KPtKPhk) 

Keep a journal on your nightstand to dump in those late-night genius ideas (that you’ll probably forget by morning anyway). This kind of Journaling can also be used to prime your brain for hapiness (but that's another post)   
  
Also learn any [Micro-Meditation](https://youtu.be/QQdGu3eMx94) to hit “pause” on your mental playback. (They are freaking easy and beginner friendly by design.)  

**6. Showers and Walks: Pre-Sleep Therapy**

You know that feeling when you step into a hot shower and the world just melts away?

A shower not only relaxes your muscles but helps your body shed heat (you need to warmup outside to cool inside), setting you up for deeper sleep. If you’re not a shower person, a quick evening walk does wonders too.

Bonus: it’s great if you’ve indulged in a late dinner or that rogue tequila shot, but in genereal:

**7. Avoid the Heavy Night Shifts**

Your *digestive system* doesn’t want to work overtime at night.

Think of it as an employee chained to your body - it needs rest too! Heavy meals before bed force your gut into the night shift, and while it might survive a deadline or party (we need them sometimes), don’t make it a daily habit.

Light, early dinners are your gut’s best friend and your sleep's friend. (easily measurable with any sleep tracking device) 

**8. Supplements: The Sprinkles**

Important: Supplements are like sprinkles, not even the icing or the cake itself.

For some magnesium glycinate or pure glycine can help (it's not about Magnesium)

Melatonin is an option too. Just keep it simple - a tiny dose of melatonin about an hour before bed can nudge you toward sleep without overloading your system. 

But remember, these are personal. Experiment and figure out what works for you.

**9. Exercise: Real Game Changer**

Breaking a sweat every day is the ultimate secret weapon. Think of *exercise* as the *flour in your dream cake* \- without it, everything else falls flat.

For me the days I move are the nights I sleep best, especially the resistance training days.  (just don’t overdo it in the evening; you don’t want to raise your core temperature before bed)

And you don't have to be fancy here. Just pick any sport or activity you don't hate and can stick to!

**10. Wake-Ups: Don’t Panic!**

Wake-ups happen - it’s life. But instead of panicking, try non-sleep deep rest (like Yoga Nidra), which builds up on [Micro-Meditations](https://youtu.be/QQdGu3eMx94) mentioned before.  

Think of it as a ""rest hack."" Relax, focus on your breath and tell yourself it’s okay to be awake. Ping each part of your body with your breath - finger by finger, arm by arm - until you drift off again.  You can also use it during the day to quickly recharge, if need. 

It’s surprisingly effective, trust me!

**11. Gadgets**

*Or* *better yet - don't trust me*! Get a sleep tracking device, like Oura ring and measure what works FOR YOU.

How much alcohol or weed or caffeine or food you can take can be quite personal. 

And If you want ULTIMATE sleep gadget - invest into a temperature controlled bed like 8 Sleep (they use thin water layer to siphon heat from under you or to warm you up).

If mine leaks tomorrow... In fact it recently did -  and here's what happened:  
[Is 8 Sleep Mattress Really Worth the Hype? (After It LEAKED on Me)](https://youtu.be/g-Yq8n_oAJw)

**The Secret Sauce: Bake It Right**

Here’s the thing: you can’t bake your “dream cake” at 1,000 degrees - it’s not a speedrun!

Sleep is about consistent habits, layered in gradually. Pick one or two strategies to start with, keep it simple and give yourself time.   
Whether it’s kicking your phone out of the bedroom or adding a walk - build your layers slowly. 

The most important part? Start today! And your sleep scores will ""rise"" 🖖

1nxb2of,https://v.redd.it/aw17jx00oysf1,A few questions about dialing in. [Tyme and Table],"I'm very new here and would appreciate any feedback(: 


The machine is from Tyme and Table and it has a Conical Burr Grinder attached. The beans are dark roast espresso from a coffee shop.


For this double shot I used 18 grams of beans in and pulled 80.4 grams out. Does that sound correct though? I did tare the scale before starting the video. It sounds like so much but the espresso tastes *very* strong (Even this morning I used a different scale and it read 80g). 


I'm also curious as to when I should start the timer. Is it when I press the button or when the espresso actually starts to come out?


Lastly, I just checked my manual and it states a dupio should be 19g and a single at 13g! (for single I've been using 8g). I don't understand why they say this considering I make sure to only grind the beans I've weighed, to ensure no overflow, and at 18g the grounds are overflowing from the dupio basket & at 8g it seems like too little in the (single shot) basket.. Idk if I should follow the manual or what. 


When I get a drink from the coffee shop they use the same beans I bought from them. it's always strong and delicious, but not as strong as this is coming out.


I will try to post pictures in the comments so you can see the grinds. ",2,1759525273.0,espresso,9,1.0,False

Before we get into whether or not I'm the arsehole, I need to give you some context.

I (42M) met Christine(44F) three years ago after I moved abroad. I'm originally from Wales, happily single. I wasn't exactly a catch personality-wise, arrogant, proud, and admittedly difficult. I knew it.

Christine didn't strike me as someone who wanted attention. A few years older, quiet, unassuming. We met in a bookshop most ridiculous way. Days later, I ran into her again in a coffee shop. Another misunderstanding, another argument. She thought I was arrogant (accurate), and I thought she was dismissive.

Then, we discovered she lived close. The turning point came when my car battery died and she, this woman who'd been giving me nothing but grief, produced jumper cables from her tiny car and had me back on the road in five minutes.

After that, we saw more of each other at the coffee shop, started talking properly. I discovered she had studied CS, could fix routers with her eyes shut, and had more hobbies than I could list: gaming, to MA. She was introverted but warm, witty, and capable of being both lazyy and driven. And she had this honest smile that disarmed me.

Slowly, I fell for her. She did too. We dated for nearly three years, survived arguments and flaws, and eventually, I realised she was my kind of odd, and I was hers. We married in her country, had a small but lovely ceremony, and it felt right.

Now here's where the actual story begins.

For our honeymoon, we went to Germany (where she grew up), then to Wales so she could meet my family. My family are old money, cold, and a bit arrogant. My sister Emily, who runs the estate, didn't attend our wedding. I think she worried I'd suddenly want a claim on the land, though I couldn't care less. Christine and I are comfortable, and she even owns her own home.

From the moment we arrived, Emily was hostile. She greeted us in black, ""mourning her brother"" (me). Christine, in her usual dry humour, asked why we hadn't been told about the ""tragic news."" That set the tone for the whole visit. Emily tried to pick fights, arranged a tea party where Christine was picked at by relatives (and a few of my old crushes), and kept making digs about money. Christine handled it calmly and with wit, but it was exhausting.

The worst Emily told Christine to her face that she'd only married me for money. Christine laughed and said she didn't care about moneyy, her only ""red flag"" was that I looked like O.Bloom. When Emily kept pressing, Christine snapped: told her to take all the money and land and shove it...

Emily lost it. Later, she told me the whole mess was my fault. We argued, words were said, and for the first time I realised how poisoned she was by money. Meanwhile, my parents were just happy to see me again, thanks to Christine.

But seriously, are WE the drama?","I’ve been wondering if we’re the drama here or if our feelings are valid. Ever since we got back from our bachelorette weekend, things have felt off with our maid of honor and some of the bridesmaids.

We made a group chat to share TikToks, wedding ideas, and color themes, but most of the time no one responded. Only one bridesmaid engaged, and otherwise it felt like my fiancée and I were talking to ourselves.

During the trip, our maid of honor didn’t really spend time with us—she mostly talked with another bridesmaid (who have hooked up before). She didn’t sit with us, skipped brunch one day because the restaurant changed, left in the middle of a football game to get coffee without asking anyone else (even though we were all hungover), and she kept wandering off at the beach. It just felt like she wasn’t present for us.

 One bridesmaid didn’t wear what I asked, kept complaining about walking or waiting around for too long while everyone was getting a tattoo. Her and her bf claimed the room with the bathroom without asking if we wanted it. We didn’t say anything because the bed was too small, but it still rubbed us the wrong way.

And now, another thing that set us off: we booked an Airbnb with 4–5 rooms specifically so our maid of honor, her babysitter, and the baby could stay there for the wedding weekend. A few days ago, when we asked for everyone's payment, she said, *“Oh, I won’t be sleeping there, just getting ready there.”* That totally changes things because we had already divided the total among everyone, and we got that house mainly because it had a kids’ room. I’m just so annoyed with the last-minute changes and the fact that she doesn’t communicate with us.

Overall, it feels like the weekend and planning haven’t really been centered on us, and I’m not sure if I’m wrong for expecting that. Since then, we really haven’t heard much from the group, other than when we’ve shared rehearsal dinner details. Our maid of honor still hasn’t purchased her flight, and the wedding is only two weeks away. I do understand that life has been tough—we’re also navigating losses in our family—but in the moment, it didn’t feel like our maid of honor was fully present.

It’s frustrating because my fiancée and I do so much for our “village,” but when it comes to us, there always seems to be excuses. Are we asking for too much? Are we the drama? ",0,1759524999.0,weddingdrama,42,0.48,False

Before we get into whether or not I'm the arsehole, I need to give you some context.

I (42M) met Christine(44F) three years ago after I moved abroad. I'm originally from Wales, happily single. I wasn't exactly a catch personality-wise, arrogant, proud, and admittedly difficult. I knew it.

Christine didn't strike me as someone who wanted attention. A few years older, quiet, unassuming. We met in a bookshop most ridiculous way. Days later, I ran into her again in a coffee shop. Another misunderstanding, another argument. She thought I was arrogant (accurate), and I thought she was dismissive.

Then, we discovered she lived close. The turning point came when my car battery died and she, this woman who'd been giving me nothing but grief, produced jumper cables from her tiny car and had me back on the road in five minutes.

After that, we saw more of each other at the coffee shop, started talking properly. I discovered she had studied CS, could fix routers with her eyes shut, and had more hobbies than I could list: gaming, to MA. She was introverted but warm, witty, and capable of being both lazyy and driven. And she had this honest smile that disarmed me.

Slowly, I fell for her. She did too. We dated for nearly three years, survived arguments and flaws, and eventually, I realised she was my kind of odd, and I was hers. We married in her country, had a small but lovely ceremony, and it felt right.

Now here's where the actual story begins.

For our honeymoon, we went to Germany (where she grew up), then to Wales so she could meet my family. My family are old money, cold, and a bit arrogant. My sister Emily, who runs the estate, didn't attend our wedding. I think she worried I'd suddenly want a claim on the land, though I couldn't care less. Christine and I are comfortable, and she even owns her own home.

From the moment we arrived, Emily was hostile. She greeted us in black, ""mourning her brother"" (me). Christine, in her usual dry humour, asked why we hadn't been told about the ""tragic news."" That set the tone for the whole visit. Emily tried to pick fights, arranged a tea party where Christine was picked at by relatives (and a few of my old crushes), and kept making digs about money. Christine handled it calmly and with wit, but it was exhausting.

The worst Emily told Christine to her face that she'd only married me for money. Christine laughed and said she didn't care about moneyy, her only ""red flag"" was that I looked like O.Bloom. When Emily kept pressing, Christine snapped: told her to take all the money and land and shove it...

Emily lost it. Later, she told me the whole mess was my fault. We argued, words were said, and for the first time I realised how poisoned she was by money. Meanwhile, my parents were just happy to see me again, thanks to Christine.

1nxatyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1nxatyh/inlaws_spend_every_weekend_at_our_house/,In-Laws Spend EVERY weekend at our house,"Long rant. Sorry.

I feel so suffocated by people I do not want to be around. They show up EVERY SINGLE WEEKEND. Usually on a Friday around 2/3. Mind you, DH does not get home until 6:30-10 pm (depending on whether or not he has to pick up his daughter).

That means, every other week, sometimes back to back Fridays, I have to spend 8 hours alone with them in total awkwardness. And they KNOW he won’t be home any time soon. I don’t know why they don’t just come on Saturday and why they have to spend two nights here. They live less than an hour away. They could easily go back home.

They barely speak English and barely interact with me. Which is why I really don’t want to be around or hang out with them. But they take up my entire dining room and kitchen and talk and play their super loud ass videos on YouTube (side by side) while I try to finish up my work day (I WFH full time) and do not feel free to just relax in my own home.

His mom is up at the crack of dawn and that means I cannot even have the kitchen to myself for coffee on the weekends. I am a complete introvert so this is extremely taxing on my mental space.

MIL takes up every inch of space in my fridge and freezer. If I make a meal, it goes uneaten in favor of her food. (Which I do not always eat due to differences in food sanitation/hygiene. She will leave food out on the counter for an entire day and there is often food buildup and residue on “clean” dishes) I feel replaced every time she is here. So much so that I don’t even care to meal plan anymore. All of it just goes to waste.

I wish they would spend at least one or two weekends with their other 3 children but they are always HERE. They have no friends. No social skills. No life. And I know that is a huge part of it, but I do not understand why they are not spending time with any of their other children and grandchildren.

My husband refuses to say a word to them. I think he actually welcomes it, which I cannot understand. I would not want my OWN parents here this often. And I LOVE them. Like I said, it’s suffocating.

He says it would be completely disrespectful to put any limit on their time here. That they can come and go however they please because they are his parents.

I have nearly left him over the issue of them posting up here for EIGHT MONTHS STRAIGHT after the birth of our son. I hate to literally tell her to back TF off when she tried to basically take over and undermine me. Multiple times. He refused to tell them to go home. Again, they live less than an hour away. I nearly lost my mind and divorced him over this issue. I don’t know who said what to finally get them to leave but things were becoming so bad between us that I no longer had the patience or reserve to sit back and be nice anymore. I think SIL may have intervened when MIL told her how angry and cross I had become with her.

I have made it very clear to DH that I do NOT want them here every single weekend. That it’s too much. But he gets so unreasonably defensive of them. It’s driving me insane.

I think my only option at this point is to just nope out of here every other weekend. To get a break from them. And hopefully they take the damn hint.

Anyone else experience this level of enmeshment and crowding?? Any advice is much appreciated. I’m so stressed come the weekends now. Because it’s not a time to relax anymore. It’s just full of THEM.",44,1759524695.0,motherinlawsfromhell,35,0.98,False

1nxard5,https://i.redd.it/3ly67r0plysf1.png,The Power of Words: A Reflection on Language and Its Impact,"*We should each keep our words within the confines of a matrix we support, a past we can defend, a present we can interpret, and a future we can articulate.*

Language is a formidable tool—an evolutionary interface for consciousness. English, with its staggering 600,000-word lexicon, offers an unmatched arsenal. By comparison, French has around 200,000, Latin brought us 55,000, Ancient Greek used about 18,000, and Biblical Hebrew conveyed eternity in fewer than 10,000. Today, the average English speaker operates with five times the vocabulary of ancient Hebrew scripture—and yet still stumbles through text messages.

We dazzle one another with vocabulary, riding a shared contract of meaning. English now dominates the thought-structures of the modern world. We project backward, assuming we’ve out-thought the ancients—but that’s hubris. They spoke fewer words with more weight. Their language had to carry time itself.

Other languages can’t always shoulder the same conceptual scaffolding. Arabic-speakers claim the Qur’an only reveals its truth in Arabic. In French, linguistic change is resisted, even politically legislated against. A computer is still an *ordinateur*, a train is still a *chemin de fer*—“Way of Fire.” Russian is dense, poetic, and unwelcome on most international platforms. Meanwhile, English sprawls, absorbs, adapts, and reinvents itself at internet speed.

Words are our true currency. Descriptions, instructions, story beats, game tells—each exchanged at checkout counters and coffee shops alike. You can quote Shakespeare or watch *The Simpsons*, study law or write code—it’s all English. And that access matters. French speakers are poorer without the tools of global discourse. Russian programmers know their tools must be translated. English is the binding matrix for modern thought.

The Bible is a case study in language economy and impact. The Old Testament builds cosmic law from a vocabulary smaller than a high schooler’s. The New Testament doubled it in Greek, yet remained minimal. Aramaic, the dead tongue of Jesus, used 700 words across 7,000 verses. Each word mattered. In contrast, English preachers often mount dogmatic sermons with vocabulary ten times the size, unaware of how much meaning they’ve lost in translation.

Language is a double-edged blade. Try Google Translate for Latin or Aramaic—you’ll feel the semantic dislocation instantly. Try speaking ancient truths with modern vocabulary, and you may end up saying something false. True understanding demands authentic discourse, not robotic transliteration. We must strive not just to be heard—but to be understood.

Everyday English speakers wield 10,000–20,000 words. Misunderstandings, bad pizza orders, and even international crises sprout from poor communication. English learners struggle not with syntax, but with *slang* and *context*. Colloquialisms mutate daily. Someone resurrects a dusty term like “neo-Marxism,” and suddenly we’re all arguing different meanings with the same words.

With such linguistic abundance, there’s no excuse for hate speech or cruelty. Clarity doesn’t require aggression. We can navigate difficult topics with grace. Words are sacred tools for expressing complex truths, not weapons to injure strangers. And if your temper breaks in traffic, you weren’t angry at the road—you just spoke a truth about yourself.

Language is how we *interface* with other minds. It’s the breath of empathy, the skeleton key of civilization. The words we choose can collapse empires—or resurrect hope. We owe it to one another to use them with care. And maybe—just maybe—we’ll finally start hearing what the ancients were trying to say.",1,1759524522.0,WRXingaround,0,1.0,False

1nxaqn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nxaqn6/which_portable_mug_warmer_works_for_kids_hot/,Which portable mug warmer works for kids' hot drinks?,"Hey everyone! As a parent of two young kids who are always on the go, I've spent countless hours researching and testing different mug warmers to keep their hot chocolate and other warm drinks at the perfect temperature. I thought I'd share my experiences to help other parents facing the same challenge.

First off, let me tell you why I started looking for a portable mug warmer. My kids would always complain about their hot chocolate getting cold during our weekend morning cartoons or while doing homework. It was frustrating watching them leave half-full cups of perfectly good drinks just because they'd gone cold.

After trying several options, I found this amazing portable mug warmer (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer) that's been a game-changer for our family. What I love most about it is its automatic temperature control - it keeps drinks warm without making them too hot for kids' sensitive mouths.

Here's what makes it perfect for children:
- The base stays cool to touch
- It has an auto-shutoff feature for safety
- The cord is long enough but not so long that it becomes a tripping hazard
- It works with most regular cups and mugs
- The temperature is consistent and reliable

One thing I noticed is that ceramic mugs work best with this warmer. Plastic cups don't conduct heat as well, so stick with ceramic or glass containers for optimal results.

I also appreciate how easy it is to clean - just a quick wipe with a damp cloth does the trick. Since kids can be messy, this feature has been particularly helpful. The surface is waterproof, so small spills aren't a problem.

For anyone still on the fence, you can check out all the features and current pricing here: https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer. Trust me, it's worth every penny, especially during these colder months.

Some bonus tips I've learned:
- Pre-warm the mug for better results
- Don't fill drinks to the very top
- Regular cleaning helps maintain performance
- Keep it on a flat, stable surface
- Always supervise younger children around warm beverages

My kids now finish their drinks completely, and I don't have to keep reheating them in the microwave (which always seemed to make them either too hot or still cold in spots). It's also great for those busy mornings when I'm helping them get ready for school and can't drink my coffee right away.

Remember that while mug warmers are convenient, always teach kids about hot beverage safety and supervise them when using heated drinks. Hope this helps other parents looking for a practical solution to keep their kids' drinks warm!

Feel free to ask any questions - I'm happy to share more about my experience with this product!",1,1759524475.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1nxanq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1nxanq0/inlaws_spend_every_weekend_at_our_house/,In-Laws Spend EVERY weekend at our house,"Long rant. Sorry. 

I feel so suffocated by people I do not want to be around. They show up EVERY SINGLE WEEKEND. Usually on a Friday around 2/3. Mind you, DH does not get home until 6:30-10 pm (depending on whether or not he has to pick up his daughter). 

That means, every other week, sometimes back to back Fridays, I have to spend 8 hours alone with them in total awkwardness. And they KNOW he won’t be home any time soon. I don’t know why they don’t just come on Saturday and why they have to spend two nights here. They live less than an hour away. They could easily go back home. 

They barely speak English and barely interact with me. Which is why I really don’t want to be around or hang out with them. But they take up my entire dining room and kitchen and talk and play their super loud ass videos on YouTube (side by side) while I try to finish up my work day (I WFH full time) and do not feel free to just relax in my own home. 

His mom is up at the crack of dawn and that means I cannot even have the kitchen to myself for coffee on the weekends. I am a complete introvert so this is extremely taxing on my mental space. 

MIL takes up every inch of space in my fridge and freezer. If I make a meal, it goes uneaten in favor of her food. (Which I do not always eat due to differences in food sanitation/hygiene. She will leave food out on the counter for an entire day and there is often food buildup and residue on “clean” dishes) I feel replaced every time she is here. So much so that I don’t even care to meal plan anymore. All of it just goes to waste. 

I wish they would spend at least one or two weekends with their other 3 children but they are always HERE. They have no friends. No social skills. No life. And I know that is a huge part of it, but I do not understand why they are not spending time with any of their other children and grandchildren. 

My husband refuses to say a word to them. I think he actually welcomes it, which I cannot understand. I would not want my OWN parents here this often. And I LOVE them. Like I said, it’s suffocating. 

He says it would be completely disrespectful to put any limit on their time here. That they can come and go however they please because they are his parents. 

I have nearly left him over the issue of them posting up here for EIGHT MONTHS STRAIGHT after the birth of our son. I hate to literally tell her to back TF off when she tried to basically take over and undermine me. Multiple times. He refused to tell them to go home. Again, they live less than an hour away. I nearly lost my mind and divorced him over this issue. I don’t know who said what to finally get them to leave but things were becoming so bad between us that I no longer had the patience or reserve to sit back and be nice anymore. I think SIL may have intervened when MIL told her how angry and cross I had become with her. 

I have made it very clear to DH that I do NOT want them here every single weekend. That it’s too much. But he gets so unreasonably defensive of them. It’s driving me insane. 

I think my only option at this point is to just nope out of here every other weekend. To get a break from them. And hopefully they take the damn hint. 

Anyone else experience this level of enmeshment and crowding?? Any advice is much appreciated. I’m so stressed come the weekends now. Because it’s not a time to relax anymore. It’s just full of THEM. ",94,1759524283.0,JUSTNOMIL,84,0.97,False

\[Hello again everyone! 

Welcome back for Part Two of this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free to check out Part One before continuing. 

So, last week we read the cold open to *ASILI*, which sets the tone nicely for what you can expect from this story. This week, we’ll finally be introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself. 

Like I mentioned last time, I’ll be omitting a handful of scenes here – not only because of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because... you’re only really here for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better! 

Before we start things off here, I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...  

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an adaptation of a real-life story – a very faithful adaptation I might add. The characters in this script were real people - as were the horrific things which happened to them. 

Well, without any further ado, let’s carry on with Henry’s story\] 

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**   

FADE IN:  

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilization...  

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear masks (deep into pandemic). The protestors CHANT:   

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...   

Almost everyone holds or waves signs - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace.  

Among the crowd:  

A GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER, which reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. 

Among these six are:   

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.   

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his neck-length dreadlocks.   

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured and model thin. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:   

RING RING RING.  

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her iPhone and pulls down her mask. Answers:  

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?   

She struggles to hear the other end.   

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?  

The girl next to her inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.   

CHANTAL: Have you told him?   

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.   

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...   

INTERCUT WITH:  

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**    

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said, I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?   

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.  

BACK TO:   

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.   

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?   

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call-  

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-  

Henry looks to his phone. Lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.   

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.   

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:   

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR' 

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**    

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S. sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the counter displays the NEWS.   

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are equal rights and, of course, the pandemic - but we cannot hide from the facts: global warming is at an all-time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is deforestation...   

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.   

A WAITRESS comes over...   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.   

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.  

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...   

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.   

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?   

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...  

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I dunno... It's just feeling... real all'er sudden. (to group) Right?   

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?   

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.   

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - basically his lapdog.   

BETH: Yeah. Me too...   

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.   

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.   

MOSES: Nadi, you're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this?  

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.   

NADI: Well... It just feels like we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights, whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this - without making a real contribution...   

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.  

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.   

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.   

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?   

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?   

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?' 

NADI: ...No-  

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...   

Everyone's clearly heard this speech before.   

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.   

Another awkward silence.   

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?   

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!   

The B.A.D.S. look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?   

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.   

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.   

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?' 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.   

The waitress brings over the six coffees.   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.   

JEROME: Yeah, me too.   

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.   

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?  

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!   

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:   

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?   

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.   

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...   

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...   

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.   

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?   

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.    

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**   

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.   

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:   

A large line has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people. Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.  

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.   

Then:   

PING.  

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...   

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:   

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to talk to U today. When's best for U??'   

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.   

**INT. HENRY’S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**   

\[Hey, it’s the OP here. Miss me?... Yeah, thought so. 

This is the first of four scenes I’ll be omitting in this post – but don’t worry, I’m going to give you a brief summary of the scenes instead.  

In this first scene, Henry goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi. Once they first try to make some rather awkward small talk, Nadi then tells Henry of her friends’ plan to start a commune in the rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both confused and rather pissed off by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship – and although Nadi doesn’t say it out loud, her silence basically confirms she’s breaking up with him. 

Well, now that’s out of the way, let’s continue to the next scene\] 

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**   

\[Yep - still here. 

I’m afraid this is another scene with some badly written dialogue. I promise this won’t be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue’s pretty much ok from there on.  

So, in this scene, we find Henry in a pub-restaurant sat amongst his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even douchier mates. Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene, and Ellie tries prying as to why he’s drinking his sorrows away. Ellie’s boyfriend and his mates then piss Henry off, causing him to drunkenly storm out the pub. 

The scene then transitions to Ellie driving Henry’s drunken ass home, all the while he complains about Nadi and her “woke” American activist friends. Trying desperately to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her douche of a boyfriend got a DNA test done online. I know this sounds like very random dialogue to include, and it definitely reads this way, but what Ellie says here is actually pretty important to the story – or what we screenwriters call a “plot point.”  

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back, her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going to). This revelation seems to spark something in Henry, causing him to get out of Ellie’s car and take the London Underground home\] 

**INT. NADI’S APARTMENT - BOSTON - NIGHT**    

\[Ok. I know you’re all getting sick of me excluding pieces of the story by now. But rest assured, this is the last time I’m going to do this for the remainder of the series. OP’s promise. 

In this final omitted scene, we find Nadi fast asleep in her bedroom. Her phone then rings where she wakes to Henry calling her. We also read here that Tye is asleep next to Nadi (what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry then asks Nadi if he can accompany the B.A.D.S. to the Congo. When Nadi says no to this due to the trip being for members only, Henry tells her about Ellie’s DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?) Henry basically tells Nadi this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because he’s also technically of African heritage. Although she’s amazed by this, Nadi still isn’t sure whether Henry can come with them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then transitions before Nadi can answer. 

Well, thank God that’s over and done with! Now we can carry on through the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\] 

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All the B.A.D.S. members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.  

MOSES: (interrupts) A’right. Let's get started. We gotta lot to cover...  

CHANTAL: Mo'. Nadi ain't here.  

MOSES: Well, we gonna have to start withou- 

The door opens on the far end: it's Nadi. Rather embarrassed - scurries down to the group. 

NADI: Sorry, I'm late.  

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.  

MOSES: Right. That's everyone? A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh - we're all signed up with that African missionary programme, right? Else how we all gonna get in? 

Everyone nods.  

BETH: Yeah. We signed up.  

MOSES (CONT'D): And we're all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid? 

Again, all nod.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (at whiteboard) A'right. So, I just wanted to make this a little more clear for y'all...  

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.  

MOSES (CONT'D): THIS: is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City. We'll be landing here...  

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): From the airport we'll get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The guy'll journey us up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...  

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): We'll get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days up river. Getting off...  

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): HERE: at the Mongala River. We'll then meet up with another guy. He'll guide us on foot through the interior. It'll take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest we'll call home. But once we're there - it's ours. It'll be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you don't even start... (pause) Any questions? 

JEROME: (hand up) Yeah... You sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?  

MOSES: Nah, it's cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty clean to me.  

Chantal raises her hand.  

MOSES: Yeah?  

CHANTAL: What about rebels? I was just checking online, and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...  

MOSES: (to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?  

Everyone's quiet. Then: 

Nadi. Her hand raised.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (sighs) Yeah?  

NADI: Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...  

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.  

NADI (CONT'D): If maybe Henry could come with us? 

 Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in shock.  

MOSES: Henry?  

NADI: My boyfriend... in the UK.  

MOSES: What? The white guy?  

NADI: My British boyfriend in the UK - yes.  

Moses pauses at this.  

MOSES: So, let me get this straight... You're asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend, can come on an ALL BLACK voyage into Africa?  

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.  

MOSES (CONT'D): What, is that a joke?  

NADI: No. It's just that we were talking a couple of days ago and... I happened to mention to him where we were going- 

MOSES: -Wait, what?? 

TYE: You did what??  

NADI: ...It just came up. 

JEROME: (to Moses) But, I thought this was all supposed to be a secret? That we weren't gonna tell nobody?  

NADI: (defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation... 

MOSES: So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group... but, you're now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN, to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what you're asking me right now?  

NADI: Since when was this trip only for African-Americans? Am I American?  

MOSES: Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.  

NADI: But, he's- 

MOSES: -But, he's WHITE. A'right? What, you think he's the only cracker who wanted in on this? I turned down three non-black B.A.D.S. asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who ain't even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?  

CHANTAL: I met him... kinda.  

NADI: (sickened) ...I can't believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.  

MOSES: Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about- 

TYE: (to Nadi) -It's best if it's just- 

NADI: -Everyone SHUT UP!  

Nadi shrugs off Tye as him and Moses fall silent. She's clearly had this effect before.  

NADI (CONT'D): Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...  

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!' 

NADI (CONT'D): This group stands for 'The Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come with us, I initially said 'No' because he wasn't one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.  

MOSES: Wait, what?? 

CHANTAL: Seriously?  

TYE: Are you kidding me??  

NADI: (ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!  

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.  

MOSES: (unconvinced) A'right. Show me this cracker. 

Nadi looks blankly at him.  

MOSES (CONT'D): A picture - show me!  

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry together. ZOOMS in on Henry.  

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): I guess this brother's in the sunken place...  

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to Nadi) You're telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?  

NADI: If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then nobody in this room would be.  

BETH: OH DAMN! 

JEROME: Hey! Hey!  

TYE: (over noise) He still ain't a member!  

Tye's outburst silences the room.  

TYE (CONT'D): It's members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?  

MOSES: Right! Members only. Don't matter if he's African or not.  

NADI: He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' - he's both! I mean, the amount of times he's defended me - and all because some racist idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let him come, then... you can count me out as well.  

MOSES: What?-  

TYRONE: -What??  

Tye's turned his body fully towards Nadi.  

CHANTAL: Well, I ain't going if Nadi's not going.  

BETH: Great. So, I'm the only girl now? 

MOSES: What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...  

The whole room erupts into argument – all while Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him. 

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**  

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!  

TYE: Nadi! Nadi, wait!  

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.  

TYE (CONT'D): I told you, you were the only reason I was going...  

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment... 

NADI: Then you were going for the wrong reasons.  

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.  

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**  

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry is deep in sleep.  

INTERCUT WITH:  

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.  

BACK TO:  

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like he's having a bad dream. Then:  

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed by a LONG, SPARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:  

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping peacefully. Regains himself.  

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.  

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**  

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.  

HENRY: (to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is she this important to you? 

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.  

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to reflection) ...This is insane.  

FADE OUT. 

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is kind of a douche, isn’t he?  

Once again, I’m sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was badly written. The only regret I have with excluding those scenes was we didn’t get a proper introduction to Henry – he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of him in Part Three. 

Next week, we officially begin our journey up the Congo River and into the mysterious depths of the Rainforest... where the real horror finally begins. 

Before we end things this week, there are some things I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?... Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay. Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi if he could accompany the B.A.D.S. on their expedition. In reality, Henry didn’t ask Nadi if he could come along... Nadi asked him. Apparently, the reason Henry was invited on the trip (rather than weaselling his way into it) was because the group didn’t have enough members willing to join their commune – and so, they had to make do with Henry.  

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry’s call to adventure had to be a lot more interesting... That’s the real difference between storytelling and real life right there... Storytelling forces things to happen, whereas in real life... things just happen. 

Well, that’s everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where our journey into the “Heart of Darkness” will finally commence... 

Thanks for tuning in everyone, and until next time, this is the OP,

1nxak9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/pppdizziness/comments/1nxak9v/pppd_gone_how/,PPPD GONE- how?,"Hello everyone, I just wanted to share my experience here. 

My PPPD journey started 4 years ago when all of a sudden I started feeling all kinds of very intense symptoms: swaying, instability, lightheadedness, you name it. 
Symptoms were 24/7. 
I've done all kids of tests and they all came back normal, except minor cervical disc protrusions (MRI, MRI angiography, EKG, cardiac ultrasound, ergometry, full thyroid check and lab, vestibulometry etc etc). I finally got diagnosed with PPPD/MDDS about a year ago, which discouraged me even more as I had to face the realization that this might never go away. 
I thought about my symptoms all the freakin' time and was extremely focused on analyzing them, afraid and axious they would somehow get even worse. It ruined my life as I avoided doing all sorts of activities, at one point I even had daily panic attacks ( going to the store/crowds triggered them) and I felt so sad knowing the quality of life I once had. 

About a year in I've noticed how I don't feel the symptoms as much when I walk my dog, carry my baby/grocery bags/anything a bit heavier and when I drive so I started doing more of the things that alleviated the symptoms at least by 10%. Gradually, even though it was so hard, over the last three years I started forcing myself to live like a ""normal"" person so I'd go to the mall, a concert, crowded places even for 10 min- I allowed myself to leave whenever I'd start getting uncomfortable and like I was going to fall. So day by day I somehow built up this idea in my head that it's okay if I don't put pressure on myself, which resulted in micro changes towards getting better. 

What I was left with in the last year was swaying sensation when standing or sitting still which drove me crazy since I work at a very demanding desk job. I kinda accepted that it was never going to go away and that I was happy with the significant improvement I already made. And about 2 months ago I realized that I had not felt any sensations that day- I was SHOCKED and so grateful that I got even one symptom-free day. Ever since all the symptoms were suddenly gone- I cannot explain it. 
The only thing that comes to my mind, but I don't know if it makes any sense is that I started drinking 0.5 litres of cold pressed juice first thing every morning ( I mix all kinds of veggies and fruits, most commonly orange, apple, beet, ginger and carrots) and I have my morning coffee later in the day, around 11AM. Also, I started doing CBT so maybe that helps too, as I feel a lot less tension and anxiety- but I don't know exactly what left first, the anxiety or PPPD. I'm hoping none of them come back, but I'm very grateful for these last couple of months, whatever happens next. 

What do you think happened here? I'm curious to see if anyone's had the same experience.

I've seen quite a few comments on this sub where women flat out tell a man that they don't do coffee dates and they expect to be taken out to dinner. I think there is a better way to do this that maintains your dignity and that also help vet the man.

On occasions where I've had men suggest a low effort date. I have two go to responses:

1. ""Thank you for the invitation, but that is not the type of date I'm accustomed to.""
2. ""Never mind, if it's too much trouble for you to plan an appropriate date, perhaps we're not a good match.""

Nine times out of ten the man will step up right away and do the right thing. If they don't you have your answer.

I also feel a date should be in line with the age and income level of the man. I have dated wealthy professional men as well as blue collar guys. I expect them to plan and pay for a date proportionate their income level. If I know they are making an effort I am happy. 

I hope this doesn't offend, but in my opinion flat out asking to be taken to dinner is a bit tacky. I think there are better and more dignified ways to let men know our expectations.

\[Hello again everyone! 

Welcome back for Part Two of this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free to check out Part One before continuing. 

So, last week we read the cold open to *ASILI*, which sets the tone nicely for what you can expect from this story. This week, we’ll finally be introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself. 

Like I mentioned last time, I’ll be omitting a handful of scenes here – not only because of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because... you’re only really here for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better! 

Before we start things off here, I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...  

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an adaptation of a real-life story – a very faithful adaptation I might add. The characters in this script were real people - as were the horrific things which happened to them. 

Well, without any further ado, let’s carry on with Henry’s story\] 

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**   

FADE IN:  

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilization...  

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear masks (deep into pandemic). The protestors CHANT:   

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...   

Almost everyone holds or waves signs - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace.  

Among the crowd:  

A GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER, which reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. 

Among these six are:   

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.   

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his neck-length dreadlocks.   

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured and model thin. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:   

RING RING RING.  

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her iPhone and pulls down her mask. Answers:  

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?   

She struggles to hear the other end.   

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?  

The girl next to her inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.   

CHANTAL: Have you told him?   

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.   

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...   

INTERCUT WITH:  

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**    

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said, I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?   

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.  

BACK TO:   

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.   

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?   

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call-  

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-  

Henry looks to his phone. Lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.   

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.   

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:   

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR' 

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**    

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S. sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the counter displays the NEWS.   

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are equal rights and, of course, the pandemic - but we cannot hide from the facts: global warming is at an all-time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is deforestation...   

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.   

A WAITRESS comes over...   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.   

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.  

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...   

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.   

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?   

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...  

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I dunno... It's just feeling... real all'er sudden. (to group) Right?   

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?   

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.   

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - basically his lapdog.   

BETH: Yeah. Me too...   

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.   

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.   

MOSES: Nadi, you're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this?  

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.   

NADI: Well... It just feels like we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights, whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this - without making a real contribution...   

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.  

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.   

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.   

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?   

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?   

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?' 

NADI: ...No-  

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...   

Everyone's clearly heard this speech before.   

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.   

Another awkward silence.   

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?   

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!   

The B.A.D.S. look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?   

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.   

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.   

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?' 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.   

The waitress brings over the six coffees.   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.   

JEROME: Yeah, me too.   

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.   

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?  

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!   

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:   

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?   

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.   

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...   

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...   

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.   

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?   

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.    

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**   

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.   

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:   

A large line has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people. Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.  

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.   

Then:   

PING.  

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...   

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:   

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to talk to U today. When's best for U??'   

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.   

**INT. HENRY’S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**   

\[Hey, it’s the OP here. Miss me?... Yeah, thought so. 

This is the first of four scenes I’ll be omitting in this post – but don’t worry, I’m going to give you a brief summary of the scenes instead.  

In this first scene, Henry goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi. Once they first try to make some rather awkward small talk, Nadi then tells Henry of her friends’ plan to start a commune in the rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both confused and rather pissed off by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship – and although Nadi doesn’t say it out loud, her silence basically confirms she’s breaking up with him. 

Well, now that’s out of the way, let’s continue to the next scene\] 

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**   

\[Yep - still here. 

I’m afraid this is another scene with some badly written dialogue. I promise this won’t be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue’s pretty much ok from there on.  

So, in this scene, we find Henry in a pub-restaurant sat amongst his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even douchier mates. Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene, and Ellie tries prying as to why he’s drinking his sorrows away. Ellie’s boyfriend and his mates then piss Henry off, causing him to drunkenly storm out the pub. 

The scene then transitions to Ellie driving Henry’s drunken ass home, all the while he complains about Nadi and her “woke” American activist friends. Trying desperately to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her douche of a boyfriend got a DNA test done online. I know this sounds like very random dialogue to include, and it definitely reads this way, but what Ellie says here is actually pretty important to the story – or what we screenwriters call a “plot point.”  

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back, her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going to). This revelation seems to spark something in Henry, causing him to get out of Ellie’s car and take the London Underground home\] 

**INT. NADI’S APARTMENT - BOSTON - NIGHT**    

\[Ok. I know you’re all getting sick of me excluding pieces of the story by now. But rest assured, this is the last time I’m going to do this for the remainder of the series. OP’s promise. 

In this final omitted scene, we find Nadi fast asleep in her bedroom. Her phone then rings where she wakes to Henry calling her. We also read here that Tye is asleep next to Nadi (what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry then asks Nadi if he can accompany the B.A.D.S. to the Congo. When Nadi says no to this due to the trip being for members only, Henry tells her about Ellie’s DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?) Henry basically tells Nadi this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because he’s also technically of African heritage. Although she’s amazed by this, Nadi still isn’t sure whether Henry can come with them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then transitions before Nadi can answer. 

Well, thank God that’s over and done with! Now we can carry on through the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\] 

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All the B.A.D.S. members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.  

MOSES: (interrupts) A’right. Let's get started. We gotta lot to cover...  

CHANTAL: Mo'. Nadi ain't here.  

MOSES: Well, we gonna have to start withou- 

The door opens on the far end: it's Nadi. Rather embarrassed - scurries down to the group. 

NADI: Sorry, I'm late.  

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.  

MOSES: Right. That's everyone? A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh - we're all signed up with that African missionary programme, right? Else how we all gonna get in? 

Everyone nods.  

BETH: Yeah. We signed up.  

MOSES (CONT'D): And we're all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid? 

Again, all nod.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (at whiteboard) A'right. So, I just wanted to make this a little more clear for y'all...  

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.  

MOSES (CONT'D): THIS: is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City. We'll be landing here...  

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): From the airport we'll get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The guy'll journey us up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...  

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): We'll get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days up river. Getting off...  

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): HERE: at the Mongala River. We'll then meet up with another guy. He'll guide us on foot through the interior. It'll take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest we'll call home. But once we're there - it's ours. It'll be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you don't even start... (pause) Any questions? 

JEROME: (hand up) Yeah... You sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?  

MOSES: Nah, it's cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty clean to me.  

Chantal raises her hand.  

MOSES: Yeah?  

CHANTAL: What about rebels? I was just checking online, and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...  

MOSES: (to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?  

Everyone's quiet. Then: 

Nadi. Her hand raised.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (sighs) Yeah?  

NADI: Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...  

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.  

NADI (CONT'D): If maybe Henry could come with us? 

 Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in shock.  

MOSES: Henry?  

NADI: My boyfriend... in the UK.  

MOSES: What? The white guy?  

NADI: My British boyfriend in the UK - yes.  

Moses pauses at this.  

MOSES: So, let me get this straight... You're asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend, can come on an ALL BLACK voyage into Africa?  

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.  

MOSES (CONT'D): What, is that a joke?  

NADI: No. It's just that we were talking a couple of days ago and... I happened to mention to him where we were going- 

MOSES: -Wait, what?? 

TYE: You did what??  

NADI: ...It just came up. 

JEROME: (to Moses) But, I thought this was all supposed to be a secret? That we weren't gonna tell nobody?  

NADI: (defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation... 

MOSES: So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group... but, you're now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN, to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what you're asking me right now?  

NADI: Since when was this trip only for African-Americans? Am I American?  

MOSES: Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.  

NADI: But, he's- 

MOSES: -But, he's WHITE. A'right? What, you think he's the only cracker who wanted in on this? I turned down three non-black B.A.D.S. asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who ain't even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?  

CHANTAL: I met him... kinda.  

NADI: (sickened) ...I can't believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.  

MOSES: Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about- 

TYE: (to Nadi) -It's best if it's just- 

NADI: -Everyone SHUT UP!  

Nadi shrugs off Tye as him and Moses fall silent. She's clearly had this effect before.  

NADI (CONT'D): Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...  

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!' 

NADI (CONT'D): This group stands for 'The Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come with us, I initially said 'No' because he wasn't one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.  

MOSES: Wait, what?? 

CHANTAL: Seriously?  

TYE: Are you kidding me??  

NADI: (ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!  

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.  

MOSES: (unconvinced) A'right. Show me this cracker. 

Nadi looks blankly at him.  

MOSES (CONT'D): A picture - show me!  

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry together. ZOOMS in on Henry.  

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): I guess this brother's in the sunken place...  

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to Nadi) You're telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?  

NADI: If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then nobody in this room would be.  

BETH: OH DAMN! 

JEROME: Hey! Hey!  

TYE: (over noise) He still ain't a member!  

Tye's outburst silences the room.  

TYE (CONT'D): It's members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?  

MOSES: Right! Members only. Don't matter if he's African or not.  

NADI: He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' - he's both! I mean, the amount of times he's defended me - and all because some racist idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let him come, then... you can count me out as well.  

MOSES: What?-  

TYRONE: -What??  

Tye's turned his body fully towards Nadi.  

CHANTAL: Well, I ain't going if Nadi's not going.  

BETH: Great. So, I'm the only girl now? 

MOSES: What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...  

The whole room erupts into argument – all while Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him. 

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**  

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!  

TYE: Nadi! Nadi, wait!  

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.  

TYE (CONT'D): I told you, you were the only reason I was going...  

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment... 

NADI: Then you were going for the wrong reasons.  

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.  

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**  

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry is deep in sleep.  

INTERCUT WITH:  

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.  

BACK TO:  

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like he's having a bad dream. Then:  

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed by a LONG, SPARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:  

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping peacefully. Regains himself.  

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.  

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**  

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.  

HENRY: (to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is she this important to you? 

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.  

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to reflection) ...This is insane.  

FADE OUT. 

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is kind of a douche, isn’t he?  

Once again, I’m sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was badly written. The only regret I have with excluding those scenes was we didn’t get a proper introduction to Henry – he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of him in Part Three. 

Next week, we officially begin our journey up the Congo River and into the mysterious depths of the Rainforest... where the real horror finally begins. 

Before we end things this week, there are some things I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?... Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay. Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi if he could accompany the B.A.D.S. on their expedition. In reality, Henry didn’t ask Nadi if he could come along... Nadi asked him. Apparently, the reason Henry was invited on the trip (rather than weaselling his way into it) was because the group didn’t have enough members willing to join their commune – and so, they had to make do with Henry.  

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry’s call to adventure had to be a lot more interesting... That’s the real difference between storytelling and real life right there... Storytelling forces things to happen, whereas in real life... things just happen. 

Well, that’s everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where our journey into the “Heart of Darkness” will finally commence... 

Thanks for tuning in everyone, and until next time, this is the OP,

1nxaiyg,https://i.redd.it/4rsqvchxjysf1.jpeg,Joined the ZP6 Club - Any tips for a new owner?,"Well, I finally caved and bought it... I've already been utilizing a J-Ultra for espresso. Aside from the knob falling off and needing replacement, I've enjoyed the J-Ultra quite a bit. I got impatient waiting for my endgame grinder to come back in stock, so I jumped on ZP6 Special while I could get one without the tariffs jacking up the cost.

I really wish the ZP6 had the magnetic catch cup of the J-Ultra. A missed opportunity, imo. But new tooling is expensive for 1Zpresso, so I get it.

I can't say I'm focused on any particular style, origin, or varietal of coffee. I love trying lots of new things and often order from different roasters every time I need more coffee. I've enjoyed washed, natural, and co-fermented coffees. I really enjoy big fruity cups and am gaining an appreciation for floral notes in my filter coffee, and I'm really hoping to taste something new over my Ode 2 with this grinder. I plan to season the grinder with some leftover beans in my freezer. I have about a kilo that I can just burn through. Maybe I'll try cold brew with them, but it's okay if they just become garden fertilizer, too.

Any tips for a ZP6 newbie? What can you share from your experience for someone who hasn't experienced the (current) pinnacle of coffee clarity?",6,1759523969.0,pourover,20,0.8,False

I’m going through a miserable divorce currently from an abusive ex. Long story but unfortunately the family judge continues to allow him visitation with our kids even with clear evidence of his violence and abuse. 

I already struggled MAJORLY with executive dysfunction for many years leading up to this. But now it’s a thousand times worse. I also have POTS, and extreme fatigue. 

Ever since the judge allowed him unsupervised visitation two weeks ago, my anxiety has been absolutely through the roof. Like I wake up in the middle of the night in a total panic gasping for air while my kids are with him. I’m terrified of going into a psychosis or some shit because this stress is the most intense that I’ve felt in a long time.

I’m at a point where I’m so desperate, trying everything just so I can continue to keep pushing through. I’m on so many medications now. Fludrocortisone & metoprolol for POTS, 
Lamictal (they think it might be Bipolar and not ADHD, but I’m not so sure. I guess we’ll see), BuSpar, and now just got a Valium prescription. 

But here’s the thing — I’m so freaking physically exhausted. constantly. So I drink coffee to help me stay awake during the day or else I will literally not be able to keep my eyes open. Obviously the caffeine makes my anxiety worse but what other choice do I have? I’m scared to take the Valium because I don’t want it to make me even more exhausted. I guess it might help me sleep, but no matter what I always have to wake up to pee 6 hours after I fall asleep.
My kids are at an age where they’re constantly fighting and destroying everything. (Twin toddlers!) I just can’t do shit. Everything is falling apart. My house is a complete and total disaster. My kids need to potty train. They need a proper routine and schedule. My personal hygiene is out the window. I just don’t even know how to keep going or how to fix any of this. Does anyone have any advice for me? Please help 🙏 everything is a mess and I don’t know how to fix it.

\[Hello again everyone! 

Welcome back for Part Two of this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free to check out Part One before continuing. 

So, last week we read the cold open to *ASILI*, which sets the tone nicely for what you can expect from this story. This week, we’ll finally be introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself. 

Like I mentioned last time, I’ll be omitting a handful of scenes here – not only because of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because... you’re only really here for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better! 

Before we start things off here, I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...  

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an adaptation of a real-life story – a very faithful adaptation I might add. The characters in this script were real people - as were the horrific things which happened to them. 

Well, without any further ado, let’s carry on with Henry’s story\] 

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**   

FADE IN:  

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilization...  

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear masks (deep into pandemic). The protestors CHANT:   

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...   

Almost everyone holds or waves signs - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace.  

Among the crowd:  

A GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER, which reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. 

Among these six are:   

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.   

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his neck-length dreadlocks.   

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured and model thin. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:   

RING RING RING.  

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her iPhone and pulls down her mask. Answers:  

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?   

She struggles to hear the other end.   

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?  

The girl next to her inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.   

CHANTAL: Have you told him?   

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.   

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...   

INTERCUT WITH:  

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**    

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said, I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?   

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.  

BACK TO:   

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.   

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?   

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call-  

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-  

Henry looks to his phone. Lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.   

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.   

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:   

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR' 

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**    

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S. sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the counter displays the NEWS.   

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are equal rights and, of course, the pandemic - but we cannot hide from the facts: global warming is at an all-time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is deforestation...   

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.   

A WAITRESS comes over...   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.   

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.  

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...   

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.   

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?   

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...  

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I dunno... It's just feeling... real all'er sudden. (to group) Right?   

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?   

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.   

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - basically his lapdog.   

BETH: Yeah. Me too...   

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.   

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.   

MOSES: Nadi, you're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this?  

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.   

NADI: Well... It just feels like we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights, whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this - without making a real contribution...   

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.  

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.   

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.   

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?   

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?   

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?' 

NADI: ...No-  

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...   

Everyone's clearly heard this speech before.   

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.   

Another awkward silence.   

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?   

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!   

The B.A.D.S. look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?   

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.   

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.   

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?' 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.   

The waitress brings over the six coffees.   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.   

JEROME: Yeah, me too.   

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.   

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?  

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!   

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:   

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?   

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.   

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...   

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...   

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.   

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?   

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.    

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**   

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.   

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:   

A large line has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people. Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.  

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.   

Then:   

PING.  

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...   

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:   

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to talk to U today. When's best for U??'   

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.   

**INT. HENRY’S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**   

\[Hey, it’s the OP here. Miss me?... Yeah, thought so. 

This is the first of four scenes I’ll be omitting in this post – but don’t worry, I’m going to give you a brief summary of the scenes instead.  

In this first scene, Henry goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi. Once they first try to make some rather awkward small talk, Nadi then tells Henry of her friends’ plan to start a commune in the rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both confused and rather pissed off by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship – and although Nadi doesn’t say it out loud, her silence basically confirms she’s breaking up with him. 

Well, now that’s out of the way, let’s continue to the next scene\] 

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**   

\[Yep - still here. 

I’m afraid this is another scene with some badly written dialogue. I promise this won’t be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue’s pretty much ok from there on.  

So, in this scene, we find Henry in a pub-restaurant sat amongst his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even douchier mates. Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene, and Ellie tries prying as to why he’s drinking his sorrows away. Ellie’s boyfriend and his mates then piss Henry off, causing him to drunkenly storm out the pub. 

The scene then transitions to Ellie driving Henry’s drunken ass home, all the while he complains about Nadi and her “woke” American activist friends. Trying desperately to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her douche of a boyfriend got a DNA test done online. I know this sounds like very random dialogue to include, and it definitely reads this way, but what Ellie says here is actually pretty important to the story – or what we screenwriters call a “plot point.”  

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back, her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going to). This revelation seems to spark something in Henry, causing him to get out of Ellie’s car and take the London Underground home\] 

**INT. NADI’S APARTMENT - BOSTON - NIGHT**    

\[Ok. I know you’re all getting sick of me excluding pieces of the story by now. But rest assured, this is the last time I’m going to do this for the remainder of the series. OP’s promise. 

In this final omitted scene, we find Nadi fast asleep in her bedroom. Her phone then rings where she wakes to Henry calling her. We also read here that Tye is asleep next to Nadi (what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry then asks Nadi if he can accompany the B.A.D.S. to the Congo. When Nadi says no to this due to the trip being for members only, Henry tells her about Ellie’s DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?) Henry basically tells Nadi this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because he’s also technically of African heritage. Although she’s amazed by this, Nadi still isn’t sure whether Henry can come with them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then transitions before Nadi can answer. 

Well, thank God that’s over and done with! Now we can carry on through the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\] 

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All the B.A.D.S. members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.  

MOSES: (interrupts) A’right. Let's get started. We gotta lot to cover...  

CHANTAL: Mo'. Nadi ain't here.  

MOSES: Well, we gonna have to start withou- 

The door opens on the far end: it's Nadi. Rather embarrassed - scurries down to the group. 

NADI: Sorry, I'm late.  

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.  

MOSES: Right. That's everyone? A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh - we're all signed up with that African missionary programme, right? Else how we all gonna get in? 

Everyone nods.  

BETH: Yeah. We signed up.  

MOSES (CONT'D): And we're all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid? 

Again, all nod.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (at whiteboard) A'right. So, I just wanted to make this a little more clear for y'all...  

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.  

MOSES (CONT'D): THIS: is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City. We'll be landing here...  

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): From the airport we'll get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The guy'll journey us up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...  

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): We'll get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days up river. Getting off...  

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): HERE: at the Mongala River. We'll then meet up with another guy. He'll guide us on foot through the interior. It'll take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest we'll call home. But once we're there - it's ours. It'll be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you don't even start... (pause) Any questions? 

JEROME: (hand up) Yeah... You sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?  

MOSES: Nah, it's cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty clean to me.  

Chantal raises her hand.  

MOSES: Yeah?  

CHANTAL: What about rebels? I was just checking online, and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...  

MOSES: (to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?  

Everyone's quiet. Then: 

Nadi. Her hand raised.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (sighs) Yeah?  

NADI: Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...  

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.  

NADI (CONT'D): If maybe Henry could come with us? 

 Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in shock.  

MOSES: Henry?  

NADI: My boyfriend... in the UK.  

MOSES: What? The white guy?  

NADI: My British boyfriend in the UK - yes.  

Moses pauses at this.  

MOSES: So, let me get this straight... You're asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend, can come on an ALL BLACK voyage into Africa?  

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.  

MOSES (CONT'D): What, is that a joke?  

NADI: No. It's just that we were talking a couple of days ago and... I happened to mention to him where we were going- 

MOSES: -Wait, what?? 

TYE: You did what??  

NADI: ...It just came up. 

JEROME: (to Moses) But, I thought this was all supposed to be a secret? That we weren't gonna tell nobody?  

NADI: (defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation... 

MOSES: So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group... but, you're now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN, to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what you're asking me right now?  

NADI: Since when was this trip only for African-Americans? Am I American?  

MOSES: Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.  

NADI: But, he's- 

MOSES: -But, he's WHITE. A'right? What, you think he's the only cracker who wanted in on this? I turned down three non-black B.A.D.S. asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who ain't even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?  

CHANTAL: I met him... kinda.  

NADI: (sickened) ...I can't believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.  

MOSES: Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about- 

TYE: (to Nadi) -It's best if it's just- 

NADI: -Everyone SHUT UP!  

Nadi shrugs off Tye as him and Moses fall silent. She's clearly had this effect before.  

NADI (CONT'D): Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...  

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!' 

NADI (CONT'D): This group stands for 'The Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come with us, I initially said 'No' because he wasn't one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.  

MOSES: Wait, what?? 

CHANTAL: Seriously?  

TYE: Are you kidding me??  

NADI: (ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!  

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.  

MOSES: (unconvinced) A'right. Show me this cracker. 

Nadi looks blankly at him.  

MOSES (CONT'D): A picture - show me!  

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry together. ZOOMS in on Henry.  

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): I guess this brother's in the sunken place...  

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to Nadi) You're telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?  

NADI: If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then nobody in this room would be.  

BETH: OH DAMN! 

JEROME: Hey! Hey!  

TYE: (over noise) He still ain't a member!  

Tye's outburst silences the room.  

TYE (CONT'D): It's members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?  

MOSES: Right! Members only. Don't matter if he's African or not.  

NADI: He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' - he's both! I mean, the amount of times he's defended me - and all because some racist idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let him come, then... you can count me out as well.  

MOSES: What?-  

TYRONE: -What??  

Tye's turned his body fully towards Nadi.  

CHANTAL: Well, I ain't going if Nadi's not going.  

BETH: Great. So, I'm the only girl now? 

MOSES: What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...  

The whole room erupts into argument – all while Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him. 

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**  

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!  

TYE: Nadi! Nadi, wait!  

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.  

TYE (CONT'D): I told you, you were the only reason I was going...  

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment... 

NADI: Then you were going for the wrong reasons.  

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.  

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**  

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry is deep in sleep.  

INTERCUT WITH:  

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.  

BACK TO:  

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like he's having a bad dream. Then:  

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed by a LONG, SPARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:  

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping peacefully. Regains himself.  

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.  

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**  

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.  

HENRY: (to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is she this important to you? 

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.  

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to reflection) ...This is insane.  

FADE OUT. 

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is kind of a douche, isn’t he?  

Once again, I’m sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was badly written. The only regret I have with excluding those scenes was we didn’t get a proper introduction to Henry – he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of him in Part Three. 

Next week, we officially begin our journey up the Congo River and into the mysterious depths of the Rainforest... where the real horror finally begins. 

Before we end things this week, there are some things I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?... Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay. Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi if he could accompany the B.A.D.S. on their expedition. In reality, Henry didn’t ask Nadi if he could come along... Nadi asked him. Apparently, the reason Henry was invited on the trip (rather than weaselling his way into it) was because the group didn’t have enough members willing to join their commune – and so, they had to make do with Henry.  

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry’s call to adventure had to be a lot more interesting... That’s the real difference between storytelling and real life right there... Storytelling forces things to happen, whereas in real life... things just happen. 

Well, that’s everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where our journey into the “Heart of Darkness” will finally commence... 

Thanks for tuning in everyone, and until next time, this is the OP,

For years, I struggled to build my savings, thinking I had to make drastic cuts. Then I realized the easiest money is the money you’re already spending—unnecessarily! **Ready to see exactly how I implement this system and maximize my money? Watch the full guide on my channel** \- [**https://youtu.be/M5s6BRJNud4**](https://youtu.be/M5s6BRJNud4)

My new approach focuses on just **five easy steps** that instantly free up hundreds of dollars a month without budget burnout. Here is the blueprint:

1. **Forgotten Subscriptions:** Conduct an audit. Cancel everything you haven't used in 30 days.
2. **Daily Coffee:** Limit those daily $5 trips. Brewing at home saves over $100 monthly.
3. **Dining Out:** Implement a ""No-Spend Weekend"" rule one weekend a month.
4. **Bill Negotiation:** Spend 30 minutes calling your service providers (Internet, Insurance). Just asking for a better rate often works.
5. **Impulse Buying:** Use the ""30-Day Rule."" If you want something non-essential, wait 30 days before buying it. 90% of the time, the urge is gone.

In GoT Jin has to ask himself, is it okay to go against family tradition, honor, pride and respect in order to help his people defeat the mongols? This question being a kind of philosophical one really is bigger than the character himself and in a way I think for me kind of detached myself from his character. 

For Atsu, so far in very early game, the story is a revenge story. And even though that’s been done a billion times over, it’s a story that is very personal to her and in sense makes me feel more connected to her as a character if that makes any sense.

\[Hello again everyone! 

Welcome back for Part Two of this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free to check out Part One before continuing. 

So, last week we read the cold open to *ASILI*, which sets the tone nicely for what you can expect from this story. This week, we’ll finally be introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself. 

Like I mentioned last time, I’ll be omitting a handful of scenes here – not only because of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because... you’re only really here for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better! 

Before we start things off here, I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...  

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an adaptation of a real-life story – a very faithful adaptation I might add. The characters in this script were real people - as were the horrific things which happened to them. 

Well, without any further ado, let’s carry on with Henry’s story\] 

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**   

FADE IN:  

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilization...  

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear masks (deep into pandemic). The protestors CHANT:   

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...   

Almost everyone holds or waves signs - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace.  

Among the crowd:  

A GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER, which reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. 

Among these six are:   

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.   

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his neck-length dreadlocks.   

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured and model thin. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:   

RING RING RING.  

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her iPhone and pulls down her mask. Answers:  

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?   

She struggles to hear the other end.   

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?  

The girl next to her inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.   

CHANTAL: Have you told him?   

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.   

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...   

INTERCUT WITH:  

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**    

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said, I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?   

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.  

BACK TO:   

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.   

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?   

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call-  

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-  

Henry looks to his phone. Lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.   

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.   

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:   

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR' 

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**    

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S. sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the counter displays the NEWS.   

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are equal rights and, of course, the pandemic - but we cannot hide from the facts: global warming is at an all-time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is deforestation...   

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.   

A WAITRESS comes over...   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.   

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.  

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...   

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.   

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?   

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...  

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I dunno... It's just feeling... real all'er sudden. (to group) Right?   

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?   

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.   

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - basically his lapdog.   

BETH: Yeah. Me too...   

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.   

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.   

MOSES: Nadi, you're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this?  

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.   

NADI: Well... It just feels like we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights, whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this - without making a real contribution...   

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.  

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.   

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.   

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?   

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?   

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?' 

NADI: ...No-  

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...   

Everyone's clearly heard this speech before.   

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.   

Another awkward silence.   

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?   

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!   

The B.A.D.S. look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?   

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.   

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.   

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?' 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.   

The waitress brings over the six coffees.   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.   

JEROME: Yeah, me too.   

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.   

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?  

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!   

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:   

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?   

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.   

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...   

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...   

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.   

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?   

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.    

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**   

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.   

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:   

A large line has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people. Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.  

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.   

Then:   

PING.  

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...   

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:   

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to talk to U today. When's best for U??'   

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.   

**INT. HENRY’S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**   

\[Hey, it’s the OP here. Miss me?... Yeah, thought so. 

This is the first of four scenes I’ll be omitting in this post – but don’t worry, I’m going to give you a brief summary of the scenes instead.  

In this first scene, Henry goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi. Once they first try to make some rather awkward small talk, Nadi then tells Henry of her friends’ plan to start a commune in the rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both confused and rather pissed off by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship – and although Nadi doesn’t say it out loud, her silence basically confirms she’s breaking up with him. 

Well, now that’s out of the way, let’s continue to the next scene\] 

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**   

\[Yep - still here. 

I’m afraid this is another scene with some badly written dialogue. I promise this won’t be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue’s pretty much ok from there on.  

So, in this scene, we find Henry in a pub-restaurant sat amongst his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even douchier mates. Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene, and Ellie tries prying as to why he’s drinking his sorrows away. Ellie’s boyfriend and his mates then piss Henry off, causing him to drunkenly storm out the pub. 

The scene then transitions to Ellie driving Henry’s drunken ass home, all the while he complains about Nadi and her “woke” American activist friends. Trying desperately to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her douche of a boyfriend got a DNA test done online. I know this sounds like very random dialogue to include, and it definitely reads this way, but what Ellie says here is actually pretty important to the story – or what we screenwriters call a “plot point.”  

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back, her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going to). This revelation seems to spark something in Henry, causing him to get out of Ellie’s car and take the London Underground home\] 

**INT. NADI’S APARTMENT - BOSTON - NIGHT**    

\[Ok. I know you’re all getting sick of me excluding pieces of the story by now. But rest assured, this is the last time I’m going to do this for the remainder of the series. OP’s promise. 

In this final omitted scene, we find Nadi fast asleep in her bedroom. Her phone then rings where she wakes to Henry calling her. We also read here that Tye is asleep next to Nadi (what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry then asks Nadi if he can accompany the B.A.D.S. to the Congo. When Nadi says no to this due to the trip being for members only, Henry tells her about Ellie’s DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?) Henry basically tells Nadi this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because he’s also technically of African heritage. Although she’s amazed by this, Nadi still isn’t sure whether Henry can come with them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then transitions before Nadi can answer. 

Well, thank God that’s over and done with! Now we can carry on through the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\] 

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All the B.A.D.S. members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.  

MOSES: (interrupts) A’right. Let's get started. We gotta lot to cover...  

CHANTAL: Mo'. Nadi ain't here.  

MOSES: Well, we gonna have to start withou- 

The door opens on the far end: it's Nadi. Rather embarrassed - scurries down to the group. 

NADI: Sorry, I'm late.  

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.  

MOSES: Right. That's everyone? A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh - we're all signed up with that African missionary programme, right? Else how we all gonna get in? 

Everyone nods.  

BETH: Yeah. We signed up.  

MOSES (CONT'D): And we're all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid? 

Again, all nod.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (at whiteboard) A'right. So, I just wanted to make this a little more clear for y'all...  

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.  

MOSES (CONT'D): THIS: is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City. We'll be landing here...  

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): From the airport we'll get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The guy'll journey us up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...  

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): We'll get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days up river. Getting off...  

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): HERE: at the Mongala River. We'll then meet up with another guy. He'll guide us on foot through the interior. It'll take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest we'll call home. But once we're there - it's ours. It'll be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you don't even start... (pause) Any questions? 

JEROME: (hand up) Yeah... You sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?  

MOSES: Nah, it's cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty clean to me.  

Chantal raises her hand.  

MOSES: Yeah?  

CHANTAL: What about rebels? I was just checking online, and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...  

MOSES: (to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?  

Everyone's quiet. Then: 

Nadi. Her hand raised.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (sighs) Yeah?  

NADI: Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...  

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.  

NADI (CONT'D): If maybe Henry could come with us? 

 Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in shock.  

MOSES: Henry?  

NADI: My boyfriend... in the UK.  

MOSES: What? The white guy?  

NADI: My British boyfriend in the UK - yes.  

Moses pauses at this.  

MOSES: So, let me get this straight... You're asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend, can come on an ALL BLACK voyage into Africa?  

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.  

MOSES (CONT'D): What, is that a joke?  

NADI: No. It's just that we were talking a couple of days ago and... I happened to mention to him where we were going- 

MOSES: -Wait, what?? 

TYE: You did what??  

NADI: ...It just came up. 

JEROME: (to Moses) But, I thought this was all supposed to be a secret? That we weren't gonna tell nobody?  

NADI: (defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation... 

MOSES: So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group... but, you're now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN, to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what you're asking me right now?  

NADI: Since when was this trip only for African-Americans? Am I American?  

MOSES: Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.  

NADI: But, he's- 

MOSES: -But, he's WHITE. A'right? What, you think he's the only cracker who wanted in on this? I turned down three non-black B.A.D.S. asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who ain't even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?  

CHANTAL: I met him... kinda.  

NADI: (sickened) ...I can't believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.  

MOSES: Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about- 

TYE: (to Nadi) -It's best if it's just- 

NADI: -Everyone SHUT UP!  

Nadi shrugs off Tye as him and Moses fall silent. She's clearly had this effect before.  

NADI (CONT'D): Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...  

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!' 

NADI (CONT'D): This group stands for 'The Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come with us, I initially said 'No' because he wasn't one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.  

MOSES: Wait, what?? 

CHANTAL: Seriously?  

TYE: Are you kidding me??  

NADI: (ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!  

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.  

MOSES: (unconvinced) A'right. Show me this cracker. 

Nadi looks blankly at him.  

MOSES (CONT'D): A picture - show me!  

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry together. ZOOMS in on Henry.  

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): I guess this brother's in the sunken place...  

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to Nadi) You're telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?  

NADI: If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then nobody in this room would be.  

BETH: OH DAMN! 

JEROME: Hey! Hey!  

TYE: (over noise) He still ain't a member!  

Tye's outburst silences the room.  

TYE (CONT'D): It's members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?  

MOSES: Right! Members only. Don't matter if he's African or not.  

NADI: He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' - he's both! I mean, the amount of times he's defended me - and all because some racist idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let him come, then... you can count me out as well.  

MOSES: What?-  

TYRONE: -What??  

Tye's turned his body fully towards Nadi.  

CHANTAL: Well, I ain't going if Nadi's not going.  

BETH: Great. So, I'm the only girl now? 

MOSES: What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...  

The whole room erupts into argument – all while Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him. 

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**  

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!  

TYE: Nadi! Nadi, wait!  

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.  

TYE (CONT'D): I told you, you were the only reason I was going...  

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment... 

NADI: Then you were going for the wrong reasons.  

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.  

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**  

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry is deep in sleep.  

INTERCUT WITH:  

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.  

BACK TO:  

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like he's having a bad dream. Then:  

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed by a LONG, SPARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:  

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping peacefully. Regains himself.  

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.  

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**  

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.  

HENRY: (to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is she this important to you? 

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.  

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to reflection) ...This is insane.  

FADE OUT. 

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is kind of a douche, isn’t he?  

Once again, I’m sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was badly written. The only regret I have with excluding those scenes was we didn’t get a proper introduction to Henry – he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of him in Part Three. 

Next week, we officially begin our journey up the Congo River and into the mysterious depths of the Rainforest... where the real horror finally begins. 

Before we end things this week, there are some things I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?... Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay. Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi if he could accompany the B.A.D.S. on their expedition. In reality, Henry didn’t ask Nadi if he could come along... Nadi asked him. Apparently, the reason Henry was invited on the trip (rather than weaselling his way into it) was because the group didn’t have enough members willing to join their commune – and so, they had to make do with Henry.  

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry’s call to adventure had to be a lot more interesting... That’s the real difference between storytelling and real life right there... Storytelling forces things to happen, whereas in real life... things just happen. 

Well, that’s everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where our journey into the “Heart of Darkness” will finally commence... 

Thanks for tuning in everyone, and until next time, this is the OP,

1nxaf7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismTranslated/comments/1nxaf7x/wellbutrin_and_its_effect_on_the_audhd_brain/,Wellbutrin and its effect on the auDHD brain,"I'm officially diagnosed with low support level autism and a bit of ADHD. I took all kinds of SSRI for years because they were trying to treat what they falsely attributed to generalized anxiety disorder. It never worked, it only made me gain weight while making me feel like a robot with no emotion. The subject of Wellbutrin came when I realized most of that ""anxiety"" came from an overactive brain. First, I was put on 150XL tablet. I had a bit of insomnia, but it gave me a good amount of energy too. Anxiety was more manageable as if I gained the ability to control my train of thoughts more easily. I was able to stop abusing coffee to make it through the day.

But then, the bad effects came after two weeks. I got this brain fog which I couldn't get myself out of. I had difficulty articulating my thoughts and it was a huge problem since slow processing was already part of my autism. So, I asked to see if I could switch to 100SR tablet and they told me I could split it in half if I wanted. I ended trying half a pill (50mg) and there were still too many side effects (brain fog, feeling a bit numbed out). So, I decided to split in quarter (25mg) and I feel it's more manageable. I get less anxiety while still feeling present in the moment. 

My question is : does anyone else with autism experienced the same thing? When I told the pharmacist I wanted to only take half a pill, she made sure to remind me it wasn't even above the threshold for a therapeutic dose. Then, I reminded her that autistic people often get strange reaction to medication, especially with pills that impact the brain. I heard that it was because we have more neurotransmitters. Too bad I had to waste 25 years of my life to realize my autistic brain was peculiar and antidepressants would affect me in a different way than most people.",5,1759523711.0,AutismTranslated,8,1.0,False

\[Hello again everyone! 

Welcome back for Part Two of this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free to check out Part One before continuing. 

So, last week we read the cold open to *ASILI*, which sets the tone nicely for what you can expect from this story. This week, we’ll finally be introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself. 

Like I mentioned last time, I’ll be omitting a handful of scenes here – not only because of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because... you’re only really here for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better! 

Before we start things off here, I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...  

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an adaptation of a real-life story – a very faithful adaptation I might add. The characters in this script were real people - as were the horrific things which happened to them. 

Well, without any further ado, let’s carry on with Henry’s story\] 

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**   

FADE IN:  

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilization...  

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear masks (deep into pandemic). The protestors CHANT:   

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...   

Almost everyone holds or waves signs - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace.  

Among the crowd:  

A GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER, which reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. 

Among these six are:   

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.   

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his neck-length dreadlocks.   

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured and model thin. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:   

RING RING RING.  

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her iPhone and pulls down her mask. Answers:  

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?   

She struggles to hear the other end.   

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?  

The girl next to her inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.   

CHANTAL: Have you told him?   

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.   

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...   

INTERCUT WITH:  

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**    

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said, I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?   

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.  

BACK TO:   

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.   

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?   

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call-  

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-  

Henry looks to his phone. Lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.   

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.   

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:   

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR' 

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**    

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S. sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the counter displays the NEWS.   

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are equal rights and, of course, the pandemic - but we cannot hide from the facts: global warming is at an all-time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is deforestation...   

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.   

A WAITRESS comes over...   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.   

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.  

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...   

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.   

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?   

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...  

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I dunno... It's just feeling... real all'er sudden. (to group) Right?   

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?   

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.   

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - basically his lapdog.   

BETH: Yeah. Me too...   

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.   

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.   

MOSES: Nadi, you're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this?  

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.   

NADI: Well... It just feels like we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights, whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this - without making a real contribution...   

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.  

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.   

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.   

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?   

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?   

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?' 

NADI: ...No-  

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...   

Everyone's clearly heard this speech before.   

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.   

Another awkward silence.   

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?   

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!   

The B.A.D.S. look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?   

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.   

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.   

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?' 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.   

The waitress brings over the six coffees.   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.   

JEROME: Yeah, me too.   

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.   

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?  

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!   

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:   

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?   

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.   

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...   

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...   

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.   

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?   

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.    

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**   

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.   

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:   

A large line has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people. Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.  

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.   

Then:   

PING.  

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...   

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:   

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to talk to U today. When's best for U??'   

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.   

**INT. HENRY’S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**   

\[Hey, it’s the OP here. Miss me?... Yeah, thought so. 

This is the first of four scenes I’ll be omitting in this post – but don’t worry, I’m going to give you a brief summary of the scenes instead.  

In this first scene, Henry goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi. Once they first try to make some rather awkward small talk, Nadi then tells Henry of her friends’ plan to start a commune in the rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both confused and rather pissed off by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship – and although Nadi doesn’t say it out loud, her silence basically confirms she’s breaking up with him. 

Well, now that’s out of the way, let’s continue to the next scene\] 

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**   

\[Yep - still here. 

I’m afraid this is another scene with some badly written dialogue. I promise this won’t be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue’s pretty much ok from there on.  

So, in this scene, we find Henry in a pub-restaurant sat amongst his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even douchier mates. Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene, and Ellie tries prying as to why he’s drinking his sorrows away. Ellie’s boyfriend and his mates then piss Henry off, causing him to drunkenly storm out the pub. 

The scene then transitions to Ellie driving Henry’s drunken ass home, all the while he complains about Nadi and her “woke” American activist friends. Trying desperately to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her douche of a boyfriend got a DNA test done online. I know this sounds like very random dialogue to include, and it definitely reads this way, but what Ellie says here is actually pretty important to the story – or what we screenwriters call a “plot point.”  

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back, her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going to). This revelation seems to spark something in Henry, causing him to get out of Ellie’s car and take the London Underground home\] 

**INT. NADI’S APARTMENT - BOSTON - NIGHT**    

\[Ok. I know you’re all getting sick of me excluding pieces of the story by now. But rest assured, this is the last time I’m going to do this for the remainder of the series. OP’s promise. 

In this final omitted scene, we find Nadi fast asleep in her bedroom. Her phone then rings where she wakes to Henry calling her. We also read here that Tye is asleep next to Nadi (what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry then asks Nadi if he can accompany the B.A.D.S. to the Congo. When Nadi says no to this due to the trip being for members only, Henry tells her about Ellie’s DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?) Henry basically tells Nadi this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because he’s also technically of African heritage. Although she’s amazed by this, Nadi still isn’t sure whether Henry can come with them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then transitions before Nadi can answer. 

Well, thank God that’s over and done with! Now we can carry on through the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\] 

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All the B.A.D.S. members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.  

MOSES: (interrupts) A’right. Let's get started. We gotta lot to cover...  

CHANTAL: Mo'. Nadi ain't here.  

MOSES: Well, we gonna have to start withou- 

The door opens on the far end: it's Nadi. Rather embarrassed - scurries down to the group. 

NADI: Sorry, I'm late.  

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.  

MOSES: Right. That's everyone? A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh - we're all signed up with that African missionary programme, right? Else how we all gonna get in? 

Everyone nods.  

BETH: Yeah. We signed up.  

MOSES (CONT'D): And we're all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid? 

Again, all nod.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (at whiteboard) A'right. So, I just wanted to make this a little more clear for y'all...  

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.  

MOSES (CONT'D): THIS: is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City. We'll be landing here...  

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): From the airport we'll get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The guy'll journey us up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...  

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): We'll get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days up river. Getting off...  

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): HERE: at the Mongala River. We'll then meet up with another guy. He'll guide us on foot through the interior. It'll take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest we'll call home. But once we're there - it's ours. It'll be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you don't even start... (pause) Any questions? 

JEROME: (hand up) Yeah... You sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?  

MOSES: Nah, it's cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty clean to me.  

Chantal raises her hand.  

MOSES: Yeah?  

CHANTAL: What about rebels? I was just checking online, and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...  

MOSES: (to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?  

Everyone's quiet. Then: 

Nadi. Her hand raised.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (sighs) Yeah?  

NADI: Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...  

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.  

NADI (CONT'D): If maybe Henry could come with us? 

 Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in shock.  

MOSES: Henry?  

NADI: My boyfriend... in the UK.  

MOSES: What? The white guy?  

NADI: My British boyfriend in the UK - yes.  

Moses pauses at this.  

MOSES: So, let me get this straight... You're asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend, can come on an ALL BLACK voyage into Africa?  

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.  

MOSES (CONT'D): What, is that a joke?  

NADI: No. It's just that we were talking a couple of days ago and... I happened to mention to him where we were going- 

MOSES: -Wait, what?? 

TYE: You did what??  

NADI: ...It just came up. 

JEROME: (to Moses) But, I thought this was all supposed to be a secret? That we weren't gonna tell nobody?  

NADI: (defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation... 

MOSES: So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group... but, you're now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN, to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what you're asking me right now?  

NADI: Since when was this trip only for African-Americans? Am I American?  

MOSES: Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.  

NADI: But, he's- 

MOSES: -But, he's WHITE. A'right? What, you think he's the only cracker who wanted in on this? I turned down three non-black B.A.D.S. asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who ain't even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?  

CHANTAL: I met him... kinda.  

NADI: (sickened) ...I can't believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.  

MOSES: Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about- 

TYE: (to Nadi) -It's best if it's just- 

NADI: -Everyone SHUT UP!  

Nadi shrugs off Tye as him and Moses fall silent. She's clearly had this effect before.  

NADI (CONT'D): Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...  

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!' 

NADI (CONT'D): This group stands for 'The Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come with us, I initially said 'No' because he wasn't one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.  

MOSES: Wait, what?? 

CHANTAL: Seriously?  

TYE: Are you kidding me??  

NADI: (ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!  

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.  

MOSES: (unconvinced) A'right. Show me this cracker. 

Nadi looks blankly at him.  

MOSES (CONT'D): A picture - show me!  

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry together. ZOOMS in on Henry.  

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): I guess this brother's in the sunken place...  

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to Nadi) You're telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?  

NADI: If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then nobody in this room would be.  

BETH: OH DAMN! 

JEROME: Hey! Hey!  

TYE: (over noise) He still ain't a member!  

Tye's outburst silences the room.  

TYE (CONT'D): It's members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?  

MOSES: Right! Members only. Don't matter if he's African or not.  

NADI: He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' - he's both! I mean, the amount of times he's defended me - and all because some racist idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let him come, then... you can count me out as well.  

MOSES: What?-  

TYRONE: -What??  

Tye's turned his body fully towards Nadi.  

CHANTAL: Well, I ain't going if Nadi's not going.  

BETH: Great. So, I'm the only girl now? 

MOSES: What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...  

The whole room erupts into argument – all while Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him. 

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**  

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!  

TYE: Nadi! Nadi, wait!  

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.  

TYE (CONT'D): I told you, you were the only reason I was going...  

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment... 

NADI: Then you were going for the wrong reasons.  

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.  

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**  

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry is deep in sleep.  

INTERCUT WITH:  

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.  

BACK TO:  

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like he's having a bad dream. Then:  

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed by a LONG, SPARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:  

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping peacefully. Regains himself.  

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.  

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**  

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.  

HENRY: (to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is she this important to you? 

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.  

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to reflection) ...This is insane.  

FADE OUT. 

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is kind of a douche, isn’t he?  

Once again, I’m sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was badly written. The only regret I have with excluding those scenes was we didn’t get a proper introduction to Henry – he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of him in Part Three. 

Next week, we officially begin our journey up the Congo River and into the mysterious depths of the Rainforest... where the real horror finally begins. 

Before we end things this week, there are some things I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?... Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay. Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi if he could accompany the B.A.D.S. on their expedition. In reality, Henry didn’t ask Nadi if he could come along... Nadi asked him. Apparently, the reason Henry was invited on the trip (rather than weaselling his way into it) was because the group didn’t have enough members willing to join their commune – and so, they had to make do with Henry.  

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry’s call to adventure had to be a lot more interesting... That’s the real difference between storytelling and real life right there... Storytelling forces things to happen, whereas in real life... things just happen. 

Well, that’s everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where our journey into the “Heart of Darkness” will finally commence... 

Thanks for tuning in everyone, and until next time, this is the OP,

Just for anyone who might want to hear it - I’ve been dealing with rosacea ever since giving birth 19 months ago. Extreme heat, redness, shiny skin along with mild spots all over my cheeks. 

The things I found some relief with and are absolute musts - musts! Without them I’m back to square one.. 

1. A handheld fan - I got mine for £12 John Lewis 
2. A gel bead face mask - I got mine for 3.80 Boots 
Sometimes I put in the freezer, take it out and let it cool down but most times whack it in the fridge for 20 mins and that will do, this way I know I won’t get any sort of rebound effect. I use this daily for 10-15 mins - can get up to 4 times per day but SO easy. It doesn’t even take make up off if you wear make up when using it. 
3. Antihistamine - find the right one for you. Daily 
4. This is new and it’s really interesting what it’s doing to my body. Electrolytes. I was experiencing an extremely bad flare 2 weeks ago when I decided to try the glycolic acid stick the inkey list had brought out to tackle KP, horrendous flare, I couldn’t hardly breath, someone said here have one of my electrolytes, and within 1 hour my flush had reduced by 85%. It’s now a real fighter for my skin. I’ve suffered with under eye bags since I was 24, I’m not 30 and the eye bags are reduced by 50% and I’m certain it’s the new introduction in the past 2 weeks to electrolytes. I will not go without now, my skin is so much less inflamed, the list is seeming to go on and on… 
4. Bioderma sensibo micellar water - what I’ve learnt for me as the ONLY cleanser I can use. Unfortunately I don’t like using cotton pads as they are harsh on my thin skin but which is the lesser evil… sometimes you have to pick your battles!! Don’t know how to get around that little problem though… any suggestions would be useful!! <3 
5. Finally - my dehumidifier. Get dehumidified!!

What has absolutely not worked: 

1. ALL OTHER CLEANSERS/ SKINCARE in general. Azeliac acid I tolerate but now skins doing better (managed better that is), why bother? I ALWAYS believe topicals are great but in our sticky sensitive situation target from within or with a heat extracting source is for me anyway the only way that’s worked so far… just don’t bother honestly. 

2. Glycolic acid and most acids - stay clear! Even on the body. It can transfer and it’s messy!

3. Not removing heat from my body/ face quickly - just get that mask on asap! Is my best advice and relax through it, in the cold.

4. Coffee and sugary drink like coke/ Diet Coke- My skin doesn’t enjoy it 

Things I’m going to incorporate next: 

1. Probiotic 
2. A better diet - going on Mounjaro soon. 
3. Relaxation methods 

I hope this helps - please add if there’s anything that’s worked for you/not worked because I’d love to read your comments xx

I couldn’t really put my finger on it but I think I know why now. I felt a bit detached from him. In GoT Jin has to ask himself, is it okay to go against family tradition, honor, pride and respect in order to help his people defeat the mongols? This question being a kind of philosophical one really is bigger than the character himself and in a way I think for me kind of detached myself from his character. 

For Atsu, so far in very early game, the story is a revenge story. And even though that’s been done a billion times over, it’s a story that is very personal to her and in sense makes me feel more connected to her as a character if that makes any sense. Idk just was thinking about that as I was drinking my coffee this morning. Loving the game so far :)  ",5,1759523553.0,Ghostofyotei,3,0.73,False

As I approach my forties, I increasingly feel that the joy of life often lies not in grand narratives, but in small, specific moments.

For example, that morning's coffee was incredibly fragrant; on my way home from get off work, I saw a beautiful sunset; or perhaps I just finished a book and have so many moving thoughts, but I don't know who to talk to.

I hope to meet some friends with whom we can naturally share these daily fragments—what are you reading recently? What interesting or frustrating things have happened at work? What are your small plans for the weekend?

I don't seek instant replies; I prefer a leisurely, back-and-forth exchange. We can see different worlds through each other's eyes, adding a warm connection to our lives.

What a show, anyway that’s not the point of this post. I haven’t finished the show yet so please no further spoilers.

I have found myself really becoming engaged and interested in the character development within this universe, however even before Howard was murdered I just couldn’t help but feel sorry for him, did he really do anything *that* wrong to deserve all the harm and harassment towards him? I am gobsmacked at his slow painful demise ultimately ending in his death and actually thought the character showed a lot of pain especially talking about sleeping in the guest room away from his wife and trying to make a perfect coffee for her for example. 

I get that the boxing match between the two was to lure Saul there so the PI could follow him I guess, but still thought there was a level within Howard that wanted a ‘man to man’ let’s settle this now and be done with it.

I have no one to discuss this point with and felt compelled after a glass of wine to put it out there 😂. Excellent show looking forward to finishing it and watching breaking bad again.

1nxa9lu,https://www.reddit.com/r/caloriecount/comments/1nxa9lu/feeling_starvation_247_despite_more_than_enough/,Feeling Starvation 24/7 Despite More Than Enough Calories,"Hi all! I desperately need nutritional advice because I think something is deeply wrong with me, or at least wrong with the way I eat. I also plan to consult a dietician through my university's wellness services btw, I'm not purely relying on Reddit to fix this issue.

I'm a 21 year old female, petite (5'1"") and weighing 109.0lbs as of this afternoon. I'm asking for advice because I constantly feel insatiable hunger and obsess over food to the point of crying, despite eating **more than enough** calories throughout the day. This summer, I totally let myself go, constantly overeating, gorging on unhealthy foods, never tracking any calories or macros, and enjoying tons of sweets without a care in the world. But this fall, I am LOCKING IN!!! My goals in my fitness/diet journey are:

1. Remove **added** sugar from my diet and enter a ""sugar detox"" ***until*** the incessant cravings for sugar and sweets go away, then I can slowly introduce sugar and enjoy the occasional treat (i.e 1-2 times a week, like a pastry with friends at a coffeeshop) without obsessing over sugar, craving it, crying because I can't have it, and binging it. *Caveats to the sugar detox (which I have been following since September 2nd, i.e. almost a whole month as I'm posting this on October 1st, with only 2 slip-ups (binges)) are:*
   1. I am still eating fruit (attempting to use it to help replace/reduce some of my sugar cravings) and today I ate a protein bar labelled ""no added sugar"" but it apparently had sugar alcohols in it, which I'm also trying to avoid so fuck my life i guess
   2. I am drinking and occasionally eating copious amounts of fake sweeteners (and no, I will not consider cutting these out of my diet)-- Coke Zero, energy drinks, and iced coffee with sugar-free syrup are consumed on an at-least-once (usually 2-3 times per day) basis-- but at least they're low in calories!
2. Focusing on eating healthier by consuming ""whole foods"" rather than highly processed foods. Some examples of (non-sugary, but tend to contain added sugar which means I couldn't have them anyways) foods I am attempting to reduce my intake of (although again- I constantly crave, shed tears over, and overall my life feels incomplete without these foods) are: *Kraft dinner, pretzels, chips, popcorn, tortilla chips, processed carbs (i.e. white bread, bagels, hamburger/hot dog buns, rolls, pastries), french fries, grilled cheese sandwiches, fried foods (like dumplings, spring rolls, etc*), *and many many many more......*
3. I used an online calorie calculator to get a starting point of how many calories I should be eating in a day. It recommended 2,066 calories to maintain my weight and 1,814 to lose 0.5lb per week. My personal goal is really just to not gain weight, and to possibly slim down a little bit. I settled on 1,900 calories as my ""magic number"", which is actually a LOT for someone who's 5'1"" and 100lbs. I input my age, weight, gender, and height correctly and I noted my assumed activity level as “VERY” (moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise 6-7 days a week). I will discuss my workouts later.

My problem is that despite eating to the very edge of my 1,900 calorie limit, I constantly feel hungry to the point of starvation and obsess over food. I feel dissatisfied with my quality of life and the constant hunger and thinking about food is distracting me from my schoolwork (I am in my 4th year at Queen's University in Canada), my sport (I'm on the novice Artistic Swimming team), and impacting my ability to take part in activities that involve food (which creates awkward social interactions). I honestly feel like I ate LESS calories BEFORE I started tracking my calories (at least my day didn't revolve around food and eating, even if the quality of food I was eating was crap).

To figure out where I'm going wrong, here are my last 3 days of eating, and my workouts for the week (to explain me putting my activity level as ""very"" and possibly unlock clues to my obsessive hunger). The 7 days of workouts is from September 21-27. I don't eat breakfast because I'd rather have the calories later in the day.

**WORKOUTS:**  
September 25: Swim workout (synchro practice)  
September 26: Swim workout; Run (5.06km, 5.05min/km, 25min45s)  
September 27: Rest day  
September 28: Swim workout (synchro practice); Run (5.07km, 5.15min/km, 26min38s)

This ended a 10 day streak totally sugar free. I feel hopeless, alone, and miserable, but I'm getting back on the bandwagon and tracking again starting today.

Please offer me any advice you may have! I am open to all questions, judgements, and criticisms. I'm honestly desperate for help as my quality of life is rapidly declining.",1,1759523350.0,caloriecount,1,1.0,False

I Just Read a Script Based on My Childhood Best Friend [Pt 2],"[\[Part 1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepyBonfire/comments/1nrcn25/i_work_for_a_horror_movie_studio_i_just_read_a/)

\[Hello again everyone! 

Welcome back for Part Two of this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free to check out Part One before continuing. 

So, last week we read the cold open to *ASILI*, which sets the tone nicely for what you can expect from this story. This week, we’ll finally be introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself. 

Like I mentioned last time, I’ll be omitting a handful of scenes here – not only because of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because... you’re only really here for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better! 

Before we start things off here, I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...  

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an adaptation of a real-life story – a very faithful adaptation I might add. The characters in this script were real people - as were the horrific things which happened to them. 

Well, without any further ado, let’s carry on with Henry’s story\] 

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**   

FADE IN:  

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilization...  

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear masks (deep into pandemic). The protestors CHANT:   

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...   

Almost everyone holds or waves signs - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace.  

Among the crowd:  

A GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER, which reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. 

Among these six are:   

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.   

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his neck-length dreadlocks.   

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured and model thin. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:   

RING RING RING.  

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her iPhone and pulls down her mask. Answers:  

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?   

She struggles to hear the other end.   

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?  

The girl next to her inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.   

CHANTAL: Have you told him?   

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.   

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...   

INTERCUT WITH:  

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**    

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said, I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?   

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.  

BACK TO:   

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.   

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?   

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call-  

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-  

Henry looks to his phone. Lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.   

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.   

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:   

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR' 

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**    

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S. sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the counter displays the NEWS.   

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are equal rights and, of course, the pandemic - but we cannot hide from the facts: global warming is at an all-time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is deforestation...   

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.   

A WAITRESS comes over...   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.   

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.  

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...   

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.   

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?   

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...  

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I dunno... It's just feeling... real all'er sudden. (to group) Right?   

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?   

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.   

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - basically his lapdog.   

BETH: Yeah. Me too...   

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.   

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.   

MOSES: Nadi, you're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this?  

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.   

NADI: Well... It just feels like we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights, whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this - without making a real contribution...   

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.  

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.   

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.   

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?   

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?   

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?' 

NADI: ...No-  

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...   

Everyone's clearly heard this speech before.   

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.   

Another awkward silence.   

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?   

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!   

The B.A.D.S. look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?   

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.   

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.   

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?' 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.   

The waitress brings over the six coffees.   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.   

JEROME: Yeah, me too.   

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.   

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?  

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!   

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:   

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?   

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.   

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...   

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...   

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.   

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?   

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.    

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**   

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.   

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:   

A large line has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people. Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.  

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.   

Then:   

PING.  

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...   

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:   

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to talk to U today. When's best for U??'   

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.   

**INT. HENRY’S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**   

\[Hey, it’s the OP here. Miss me?... Yeah, thought so. 

This is the first of four scenes I’ll be omitting in this post – but don’t worry, I’m going to give you a brief summary of the scenes instead.  

In this first scene, Henry goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi. Once they first try to make some rather awkward small talk, Nadi then tells Henry of her friends’ plan to start a commune in the rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both confused and rather pissed off by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship – and although Nadi doesn’t say it out loud, her silence basically confirms she’s breaking up with him. 

Well, now that’s out of the way, let’s continue to the next scene\] 

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**   

\[Yep - still here. 

I’m afraid this is another scene with some badly written dialogue. I promise this won’t be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue’s pretty much ok from there on.  

So, in this scene, we find Henry in a pub-restaurant sat amongst his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even douchier mates. Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene, and Ellie tries prying as to why he’s drinking his sorrows away. Ellie’s boyfriend and his mates then piss Henry off, causing him to drunkenly storm out the pub. 

The scene then transitions to Ellie driving Henry’s drunken ass home, all the while he complains about Nadi and her “woke” American activist friends. Trying desperately to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her douche of a boyfriend got a DNA test done online. I know this sounds like very random dialogue to include, and it definitely reads this way, but what Ellie says here is actually pretty important to the story – or what we screenwriters call a “plot point.”  

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back, her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going to). This revelation seems to spark something in Henry, causing him to get out of Ellie’s car and take the London Underground home\] 

**INT. NADI’S APARTMENT - BOSTON - NIGHT**    

\[Ok. I know you’re all getting sick of me excluding pieces of the story by now. But rest assured, this is the last time I’m going to do this for the remainder of the series. OP’s promise. 

In this final omitted scene, we find Nadi fast asleep in her bedroom. Her phone then rings where she wakes to Henry calling her. We also read here that Tye is asleep next to Nadi (what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry then asks Nadi if he can accompany the B.A.D.S. to the Congo. When Nadi says no to this due to the trip being for members only, Henry tells her about Ellie’s DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?) Henry basically tells Nadi this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because he’s also technically of African heritage. Although she’s amazed by this, Nadi still isn’t sure whether Henry can come with them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then transitions before Nadi can answer. 

Well, thank God that’s over and done with! Now we can carry on through the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\] 

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All the B.A.D.S. members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.  

MOSES: (interrupts) A’right. Let's get started. We gotta lot to cover...  

CHANTAL: Mo'. Nadi ain't here.  

MOSES: Well, we gonna have to start withou- 

The door opens on the far end: it's Nadi. Rather embarrassed - scurries down to the group. 

NADI: Sorry, I'm late.  

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.  

MOSES: Right. That's everyone? A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh - we're all signed up with that African missionary programme, right? Else how we all gonna get in? 

Everyone nods.  

BETH: Yeah. We signed up.  

MOSES (CONT'D): And we're all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid? 

Again, all nod.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (at whiteboard) A'right. So, I just wanted to make this a little more clear for y'all...  

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.  

MOSES (CONT'D): THIS: is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City. We'll be landing here...  

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): From the airport we'll get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The guy'll journey us up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...  

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): We'll get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days up river. Getting off...  

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): HERE: at the Mongala River. We'll then meet up with another guy. He'll guide us on foot through the interior. It'll take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest we'll call home. But once we're there - it's ours. It'll be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you don't even start... (pause) Any questions? 

JEROME: (hand up) Yeah... You sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?  

MOSES: Nah, it's cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty clean to me.  

Chantal raises her hand.  

MOSES: Yeah?  

CHANTAL: What about rebels? I was just checking online, and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...  

MOSES: (to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?  

Everyone's quiet. Then: 

Nadi. Her hand raised.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (sighs) Yeah?  

NADI: Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...  

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.  

NADI (CONT'D): If maybe Henry could come with us? 

 Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in shock.  

MOSES: Henry?  

NADI: My boyfriend... in the UK.  

MOSES: What? The white guy?  

NADI: My British boyfriend in the UK - yes.  

Moses pauses at this.  

MOSES: So, let me get this straight... You're asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend, can come on an ALL BLACK voyage into Africa?  

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.  

MOSES (CONT'D): What, is that a joke?  

NADI: No. It's just that we were talking a couple of days ago and... I happened to mention to him where we were going- 

MOSES: -Wait, what?? 

TYE: You did what??  

NADI: ...It just came up. 

JEROME: (to Moses) But, I thought this was all supposed to be a secret? That we weren't gonna tell nobody?  

NADI: (defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation... 

MOSES: So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group... but, you're now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN, to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what you're asking me right now?  

NADI: Since when was this trip only for African-Americans? Am I American?  

MOSES: Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.  

NADI: But, he's- 

MOSES: -But, he's WHITE. A'right? What, you think he's the only cracker who wanted in on this? I turned down three non-black B.A.D.S. asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who ain't even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?  

CHANTAL: I met him... kinda.  

NADI: (sickened) ...I can't believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.  

MOSES: Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about- 

TYE: (to Nadi) -It's best if it's just- 

NADI: -Everyone SHUT UP!  

Nadi shrugs off Tye as him and Moses fall silent. She's clearly had this effect before.  

NADI (CONT'D): Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...  

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!' 

NADI (CONT'D): This group stands for 'The Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come with us, I initially said 'No' because he wasn't one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.  

MOSES: Wait, what?? 

CHANTAL: Seriously?  

TYE: Are you kidding me??  

NADI: (ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!  

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.  

MOSES: (unconvinced) A'right. Show me this cracker. 

Nadi looks blankly at him.  

MOSES (CONT'D): A picture - show me!  

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry together. ZOOMS in on Henry.  

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): I guess this brother's in the sunken place...  

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to Nadi) You're telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?  

NADI: If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then nobody in this room would be.  

BETH: OH DAMN! 

JEROME: Hey! Hey!  

TYE: (over noise) He still ain't a member!  

Tye's outburst silences the room.  

TYE (CONT'D): It's members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?  

MOSES: Right! Members only. Don't matter if he's African or not.  

NADI: He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' - he's both! I mean, the amount of times he's defended me - and all because some racist idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let him come, then... you can count me out as well.  

MOSES: What?-  

TYRONE: -What??  

Tye's turned his body fully towards Nadi.  

CHANTAL: Well, I ain't going if Nadi's not going.  

BETH: Great. So, I'm the only girl now? 

MOSES: What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...  

The whole room erupts into argument – all while Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him. 

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**  

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!  

TYE: Nadi! Nadi, wait!  

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.  

TYE (CONT'D): I told you, you were the only reason I was going...  

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment... 

NADI: Then you were going for the wrong reasons.  

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.  

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**  

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry is deep in sleep.  

INTERCUT WITH:  

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.  

BACK TO:  

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like he's having a bad dream. Then:  

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed by a LONG, SPARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:  

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping peacefully. Regains himself.  

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.  

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**  

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.  

HENRY: (to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is she this important to you? 

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.  

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to reflection) ...This is insane.  

FADE OUT. 

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is kind of a douche, isn’t he?  

Once again, I’m sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was badly written. The only regret I have with excluding those scenes was we didn’t get a proper introduction to Henry – he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of him in Part Three. 

Next week, we officially begin our journey up the Congo River and into the mysterious depths of the Rainforest... where the real horror finally begins. 

Before we end things this week, there are some things I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?... Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay. Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi if he could accompany the B.A.D.S. on their expedition. In reality, Henry didn’t ask Nadi if he could come along... Nadi asked him. Apparently, the reason Henry was invited on the trip (rather than weaselling his way into it) was because the group didn’t have enough members willing to join their commune – and so, they had to make do with Henry.  

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry’s call to adventure had to be a lot more interesting... That’s the real difference between storytelling and real life right there... Storytelling forces things to happen, whereas in real life... things just happen. 

Well, that’s everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where our journey into the “Heart of Darkness” will finally commence... 

Thanks for tuning in everyone, and until next time, this is the OP,

1nxa9ab,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1nxa9ab/no_one_wants_to_talk_anymore/,no one wants to talk anymore,"I tried calling my parents, they rarely want to talk. They vary their excuses: ""too tired as it's too late, we're getting an early night"", ""busy on dog walk now"", ""we're about to eat dinner"", ""we're eating dinner"", ""I'm cooking"", or they just don't pick up the phone. I have tried at different times of day on different dates but it's always the same result.

I tried calling my friends, they never answer as they're either at work or busy or too tired.

Tried speaking to my partner, but again, at work, too tired to speak (when at home), or wants to watch tv, or wants to scroll on instagram.

Tried making friends and talking to strangers, but it's the same result.

However, everyone is happy to text message or scroll on social media- just no one wants to talk.

Now, compare this to 20 years ago- everyone was happy to meet, everyone wanted a chat, and happy to speak on the phone.

Something is going on with the human race in terms of lack of willingness to experience the human experience - everyone is becoming robotic and wanting to spend time online, in front of screens. The problem is if you're out of the matrix & trying to stay healthy in terms of social interaction, you're dragged down by the fact no one else wants to spend time with you anymore.

We are wired for in person interaction. Health issues are through the roof since this screen age, and that never used to be an issue. Problem is that those of us aware of it who want to not be on screens, can't find each other anymore. 99.9999% of people just aren't self aware enough to realise how unhappy they are with screentime to actually meet or speak in person anymore.

**EDIT:**  
**I also tried reaching out to redditors for a virtual video chat over a coffee - no one wants to. They will only text online. The only people I've found who are willing to meet or talk in person are people trying to make money off you (salespeople, personal trainers, therapists). And even they offer discounts for talking over a screen, which defeats many health benefits - but the fact their goal is money makes it toxic - not everyone can afford to pay to socialise, and it's always in the back of your mind that they wouldn't be willing to talk to you were you not a potential income stream.**

**I also tried talking to everyone about how it's making me feel- they never change their behaviour. People are addicted to screens. It's like trying to talk to cocaine addicts about how their addiction is making you feel.**

**EDIT 2:**  
**I also noticed that at parties, people are almost always on their phones on social media - it's like a drug. No one wants to talk in person. The only time they will talk in person is if someone super good looking or muscular or unusual walks in the room. This is for people in all walks of life, from family, to friends, to strangers and work colleagues from all cities in the west that I've visited, including towns and villages in the countryside. It doesn't appear to be just one ""type"" but across society. It's really toxic and dehumanising.**

It is like that episode of Star Trek TNG ""the game"" where everyone on the ship becomes addicted to a game and won't talk in person anymore. They have to be ""de-programmed"" to be themselves again.

\-----  
***EDIT 3: I just tried sending a video to one of my best friends of 25 years - I talked to the camera as if talking to her directly. I wanted to see if she responds. She has become so obsessed with text messaging online to me that she didn't even respond to the video chat! She's a prime example of someone I used to meet up with or chat with all the time & she was happy to before social media existed, but since the social media age she's become addicted to screen texting.***",24,1759523329.0,Life,41,0.93,False

\[Hello again everyone! 

Welcome back for Part Two of this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free to check out Part One before continuing. 

So, last week we read the cold open to *ASILI*, which sets the tone nicely for what you can expect from this story. This week, we’ll finally be introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself. 

Like I mentioned last time, I’ll be omitting a handful of scenes here – not only because of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because... you’re only really here for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better! 

Before we start things off here, I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...  

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an adaptation of a real-life story – a very faithful adaptation I might add. The characters in this script were real people - as were the horrific things which happened to them. 

Well, without any further ado, let’s carry on with Henry’s story\] 

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**   

FADE IN:  

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilization...  

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear masks (deep into pandemic). The protestors CHANT:   

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...   

Almost everyone holds or waves signs - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace.  

Among the crowd:  

A GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER, which reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. 

Among these six are:   

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.   

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his neck-length dreadlocks.   

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured and model thin. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:   

RING RING RING.  

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her iPhone and pulls down her mask. Answers:  

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?   

She struggles to hear the other end.   

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?  

The girl next to her inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.   

CHANTAL: Have you told him?   

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.   

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...   

INTERCUT WITH:  

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**    

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said, I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?   

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.  

BACK TO:   

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.   

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?   

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call-  

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-  

Henry looks to his phone. Lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.   

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.   

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:   

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR' 

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**    

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S. sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the counter displays the NEWS.   

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are equal rights and, of course, the pandemic - but we cannot hide from the facts: global warming is at an all-time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is deforestation...   

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.   

A WAITRESS comes over...   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.   

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.  

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...   

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.   

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?   

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...  

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I dunno... It's just feeling... real all'er sudden. (to group) Right?   

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?   

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.   

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - basically his lapdog.   

BETH: Yeah. Me too...   

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.   

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.   

MOSES: Nadi, you're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this?  

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.   

NADI: Well... It just feels like we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights, whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this - without making a real contribution...   

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.  

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.   

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.   

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?   

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?   

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?' 

NADI: ...No-  

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...   

Everyone's clearly heard this speech before.   

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.   

Another awkward silence.   

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?   

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!   

The B.A.D.S. look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?   

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.   

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.   

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?' 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.   

The waitress brings over the six coffees.   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.   

JEROME: Yeah, me too.   

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.   

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?  

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!   

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:   

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?   

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.   

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...   

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...   

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.   

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?   

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.    

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**   

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.   

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:   

A large line has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people. Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.  

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.   

Then:   

PING.  

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...   

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:   

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to talk to U today. When's best for U??'   

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.   

**INT. HENRY’S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**   

\[Hey, it’s the OP here. Miss me?... Yeah, thought so. 

This is the first of four scenes I’ll be omitting in this post – but don’t worry, I’m going to give you a brief summary of the scenes instead.  

In this first scene, Henry goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi. Once they first try to make some rather awkward small talk, Nadi then tells Henry of her friends’ plan to start a commune in the rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both confused and rather pissed off by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship – and although Nadi doesn’t say it out loud, her silence basically confirms she’s breaking up with him. 

Well, now that’s out of the way, let’s continue to the next scene\] 

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**   

\[Yep - still here. 

I’m afraid this is another scene with some badly written dialogue. I promise this won’t be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue’s pretty much ok from there on.  

So, in this scene, we find Henry in a pub-restaurant sat amongst his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even douchier mates. Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene, and Ellie tries prying as to why he’s drinking his sorrows away. Ellie’s boyfriend and his mates then piss Henry off, causing him to drunkenly storm out the pub. 

The scene then transitions to Ellie driving Henry’s drunken ass home, all the while he complains about Nadi and her “woke” American activist friends. Trying desperately to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her douche of a boyfriend got a DNA test done online. I know this sounds like very random dialogue to include, and it definitely reads this way, but what Ellie says here is actually pretty important to the story – or what we screenwriters call a “plot point.”  

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back, her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going to). This revelation seems to spark something in Henry, causing him to get out of Ellie’s car and take the London Underground home\] 

**INT. NADI’S APARTMENT - BOSTON - NIGHT**    

\[Ok. I know you’re all getting sick of me excluding pieces of the story by now. But rest assured, this is the last time I’m going to do this for the remainder of the series. OP’s promise. 

In this final omitted scene, we find Nadi fast asleep in her bedroom. Her phone then rings where she wakes to Henry calling her. We also read here that Tye is asleep next to Nadi (what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry then asks Nadi if he can accompany the B.A.D.S. to the Congo. When Nadi says no to this due to the trip being for members only, Henry tells her about Ellie’s DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?) Henry basically tells Nadi this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because he’s also technically of African heritage. Although she’s amazed by this, Nadi still isn’t sure whether Henry can come with them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then transitions before Nadi can answer. 

Well, thank God that’s over and done with! Now we can carry on through the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\] 

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All the B.A.D.S. members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.  

MOSES: (interrupts) A’right. Let's get started. We gotta lot to cover...  

CHANTAL: Mo'. Nadi ain't here.  

MOSES: Well, we gonna have to start withou- 

The door opens on the far end: it's Nadi. Rather embarrassed - scurries down to the group. 

NADI: Sorry, I'm late.  

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.  

MOSES: Right. That's everyone? A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh - we're all signed up with that African missionary programme, right? Else how we all gonna get in? 

Everyone nods.  

BETH: Yeah. We signed up.  

MOSES (CONT'D): And we're all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid? 

Again, all nod.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (at whiteboard) A'right. So, I just wanted to make this a little more clear for y'all...  

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.  

MOSES (CONT'D): THIS: is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City. We'll be landing here...  

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): From the airport we'll get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The guy'll journey us up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...  

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): We'll get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days up river. Getting off...  

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): HERE: at the Mongala River. We'll then meet up with another guy. He'll guide us on foot through the interior. It'll take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest we'll call home. But once we're there - it's ours. It'll be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you don't even start... (pause) Any questions? 

JEROME: (hand up) Yeah... You sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?  

MOSES: Nah, it's cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty clean to me.  

Chantal raises her hand.  

MOSES: Yeah?  

CHANTAL: What about rebels? I was just checking online, and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...  

MOSES: (to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?  

Everyone's quiet. Then: 

Nadi. Her hand raised.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (sighs) Yeah?  

NADI: Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...  

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.  

NADI (CONT'D): If maybe Henry could come with us? 

 Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in shock.  

MOSES: Henry?  

NADI: My boyfriend... in the UK.  

MOSES: What? The white guy?  

NADI: My British boyfriend in the UK - yes.  

Moses pauses at this.  

MOSES: So, let me get this straight... You're asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend, can come on an ALL BLACK voyage into Africa?  

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.  

MOSES (CONT'D): What, is that a joke?  

NADI: No. It's just that we were talking a couple of days ago and... I happened to mention to him where we were going- 

MOSES: -Wait, what?? 

TYE: You did what??  

NADI: ...It just came up. 

JEROME: (to Moses) But, I thought this was all supposed to be a secret? That we weren't gonna tell nobody?  

NADI: (defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation... 

MOSES: So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group... but, you're now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN, to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what you're asking me right now?  

NADI: Since when was this trip only for African-Americans? Am I American?  

MOSES: Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.  

NADI: But, he's- 

MOSES: -But, he's WHITE. A'right? What, you think he's the only cracker who wanted in on this? I turned down three non-black B.A.D.S. asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who ain't even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?  

CHANTAL: I met him... kinda.  

NADI: (sickened) ...I can't believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.  

MOSES: Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about- 

TYE: (to Nadi) -It's best if it's just- 

NADI: -Everyone SHUT UP!  

Nadi shrugs off Tye as him and Moses fall silent. She's clearly had this effect before.  

NADI (CONT'D): Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...  

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!' 

NADI (CONT'D): This group stands for 'The Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come with us, I initially said 'No' because he wasn't one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.  

MOSES: Wait, what?? 

CHANTAL: Seriously?  

TYE: Are you kidding me??  

NADI: (ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!  

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.  

MOSES: (unconvinced) A'right. Show me this cracker. 

Nadi looks blankly at him.  

MOSES (CONT'D): A picture - show me!  

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry together. ZOOMS in on Henry.  

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): I guess this brother's in the sunken place...  

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to Nadi) You're telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?  

NADI: If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then nobody in this room would be.  

BETH: OH DAMN! 

JEROME: Hey! Hey!  

TYE: (over noise) He still ain't a member!  

Tye's outburst silences the room.  

TYE (CONT'D): It's members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?  

MOSES: Right! Members only. Don't matter if he's African or not.  

NADI: He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' - he's both! I mean, the amount of times he's defended me - and all because some racist idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let him come, then... you can count me out as well.  

MOSES: What?-  

TYRONE: -What??  

Tye's turned his body fully towards Nadi.  

CHANTAL: Well, I ain't going if Nadi's not going.  

BETH: Great. So, I'm the only girl now? 

MOSES: What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...  

The whole room erupts into argument – all while Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him. 

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**  

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!  

TYE: Nadi! Nadi, wait!  

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.  

TYE (CONT'D): I told you, you were the only reason I was going...  

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment... 

NADI: Then you were going for the wrong reasons.  

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.  

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**  

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry is deep in sleep.  

INTERCUT WITH:  

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.  

BACK TO:  

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like he's having a bad dream. Then:  

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed by a LONG, SPARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:  

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping peacefully. Regains himself.  

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.  

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**  

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.  

HENRY: (to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is she this important to you? 

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.  

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to reflection) ...This is insane.  

FADE OUT. 

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is kind of a douche, isn’t he?  

Once again, I’m sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was badly written. The only regret I have with excluding those scenes was we didn’t get a proper introduction to Henry – he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of him in Part Three. 

Next week, we officially begin our journey up the Congo River and into the mysterious depths of the Rainforest... where the real horror finally begins. 

Before we end things this week, there are some things I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?... Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay. Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi if he could accompany the B.A.D.S. on their expedition. In reality, Henry didn’t ask Nadi if he could come along... Nadi asked him. Apparently, the reason Henry was invited on the trip (rather than weaselling his way into it) was because the group didn’t have enough members willing to join their commune – and so, they had to make do with Henry.  

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry’s call to adventure had to be a lot more interesting... That’s the real difference between storytelling and real life right there... Storytelling forces things to happen, whereas in real life... things just happen. 

Well, that’s everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where our journey into the “Heart of Darkness” will finally commence... 

Thanks for tuning in everyone, and until next time, this is the OP,

That misty pine woods, the Great Northern’s fireplace, black coffee and cherry pie, vintage clothes, and incense. Something nostalgic, mysterious, and a little uncanny.

Imagine walking through Douglas fir woods, tasting the fog as much as smelling it - pine, wood, and mist. Then the scene shifts: you’re in the Great Northern by the fireplace, drinking strong black coffee and eating cherry pie. You’re wearing a vintage trench coat that smells of an old wardrobe with a faint trace of aftershave.

At the core of it all is nostalgia. Safe and bittersweet, but shadowed by the Black Lodge burning incense, ash, smoke.

\[Hello again everyone! 

Welcome back for Part Two of this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free to check out Part One before continuing. 

So, last week we read the cold open to *ASILI*, which sets the tone nicely for what you can expect from this story. This week, we’ll finally be introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself. 

Like I mentioned last time, I’ll be omitting a handful of scenes here – not only because of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because... you’re only really here for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better! 

Before we start things off here, I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...  

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an adaptation of a real-life story – a very faithful adaptation I might add. The characters in this script were real people - as were the horrific things which happened to them. 

Well, without any further ado, let’s carry on with Henry’s story\] 

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**   

FADE IN:  

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilization...  

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear masks (deep into pandemic). The protestors CHANT:   

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...   

Almost everyone holds or waves signs - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace.  

Among the crowd:  

A GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER, which reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. 

Among these six are:   

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.   

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his neck-length dreadlocks.   

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured and model thin. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:   

RING RING RING.  

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her iPhone and pulls down her mask. Answers:  

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?   

She struggles to hear the other end.   

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?  

The girl next to her inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.   

CHANTAL: Have you told him?   

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.   

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...   

INTERCUT WITH:  

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**    

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said, I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?   

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.  

BACK TO:   

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.   

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?   

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call-  

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-  

Henry looks to his phone. Lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.   

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.   

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:   

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR' 

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**    

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S. sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the counter displays the NEWS.   

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are equal rights and, of course, the pandemic - but we cannot hide from the facts: global warming is at an all-time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is deforestation...   

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.   

A WAITRESS comes over...   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.   

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.  

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...   

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.   

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?   

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...  

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I dunno... It's just feeling... real all'er sudden. (to group) Right?   

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?   

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.   

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - basically his lapdog.   

BETH: Yeah. Me too...   

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.   

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.   

MOSES: Nadi, you're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this?  

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.   

NADI: Well... It just feels like we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights, whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this - without making a real contribution...   

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.  

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.   

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.   

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?   

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?   

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?' 

NADI: ...No-  

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...   

Everyone's clearly heard this speech before.   

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.   

Another awkward silence.   

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?   

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!   

The B.A.D.S. look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?   

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.   

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.   

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?' 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.   

The waitress brings over the six coffees.   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.   

JEROME: Yeah, me too.   

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.   

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?  

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!   

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:   

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?   

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.   

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...   

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...   

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.   

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?   

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.    

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**   

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.   

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:   

A large line has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people. Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.  

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.   

Then:   

PING.  

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...   

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:   

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to talk to U today. When's best for U??'   

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.   

**INT. HENRY’S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**   

\[Hey, it’s the OP here. Miss me?... Yeah, thought so. 

This is the first of four scenes I’ll be omitting in this post – but don’t worry, I’m going to give you a brief summary of the scenes instead.  

In this first scene, Henry goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi. Once they first try to make some rather awkward small talk, Nadi then tells Henry of her friends’ plan to start a commune in the rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both confused and rather pissed off by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship – and although Nadi doesn’t say it out loud, her silence basically confirms she’s breaking up with him. 

Well, now that’s out of the way, let’s continue to the next scene\] 

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**   

\[Yep - still here. 

I’m afraid this is another scene with some badly written dialogue. I promise this won’t be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue’s pretty much ok from there on.  

So, in this scene, we find Henry in a pub-restaurant sat amongst his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even douchier mates. Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene, and Ellie tries prying as to why he’s drinking his sorrows away. Ellie’s boyfriend and his mates then piss Henry off, causing him to drunkenly storm out the pub. 

The scene then transitions to Ellie driving Henry’s drunken ass home, all the while he complains about Nadi and her “woke” American activist friends. Trying desperately to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her douche of a boyfriend got a DNA test done online. I know this sounds like very random dialogue to include, and it definitely reads this way, but what Ellie says here is actually pretty important to the story – or what we screenwriters call a “plot point.”  

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back, her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going to). This revelation seems to spark something in Henry, causing him to get out of Ellie’s car and take the London Underground home\] 

**INT. NADI’S APARTMENT - BOSTON - NIGHT**    

\[Ok. I know you’re all getting sick of me excluding pieces of the story by now. But rest assured, this is the last time I’m going to do this for the remainder of the series. OP’s promise. 

In this final omitted scene, we find Nadi fast asleep in her bedroom. Her phone then rings where she wakes to Henry calling her. We also read here that Tye is asleep next to Nadi (what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry then asks Nadi if he can accompany the B.A.D.S. to the Congo. When Nadi says no to this due to the trip being for members only, Henry tells her about Ellie’s DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?) Henry basically tells Nadi this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because he’s also technically of African heritage. Although she’s amazed by this, Nadi still isn’t sure whether Henry can come with them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then transitions before Nadi can answer. 

Well, thank God that’s over and done with! Now we can carry on through the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\] 

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All the B.A.D.S. members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.  

MOSES: (interrupts) A’right. Let's get started. We gotta lot to cover...  

CHANTAL: Mo'. Nadi ain't here.  

MOSES: Well, we gonna have to start withou- 

The door opens on the far end: it's Nadi. Rather embarrassed - scurries down to the group. 

NADI: Sorry, I'm late.  

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.  

MOSES: Right. That's everyone? A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh - we're all signed up with that African missionary programme, right? Else how we all gonna get in? 

Everyone nods.  

BETH: Yeah. We signed up.  

MOSES (CONT'D): And we're all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid? 

Again, all nod.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (at whiteboard) A'right. So, I just wanted to make this a little more clear for y'all...  

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.  

MOSES (CONT'D): THIS: is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City. We'll be landing here...  

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): From the airport we'll get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The guy'll journey us up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...  

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): We'll get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days up river. Getting off...  

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): HERE: at the Mongala River. We'll then meet up with another guy. He'll guide us on foot through the interior. It'll take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest we'll call home. But once we're there - it's ours. It'll be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you don't even start... (pause) Any questions? 

JEROME: (hand up) Yeah... You sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?  

MOSES: Nah, it's cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty clean to me.  

Chantal raises her hand.  

MOSES: Yeah?  

CHANTAL: What about rebels? I was just checking online, and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...  

MOSES: (to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?  

Everyone's quiet. Then: 

Nadi. Her hand raised.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (sighs) Yeah?  

NADI: Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...  

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.  

NADI (CONT'D): If maybe Henry could come with us? 

 Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in shock.  

MOSES: Henry?  

NADI: My boyfriend... in the UK.  

MOSES: What? The white guy?  

NADI: My British boyfriend in the UK - yes.  

Moses pauses at this.  

MOSES: So, let me get this straight... You're asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend, can come on an ALL BLACK voyage into Africa?  

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.  

MOSES (CONT'D): What, is that a joke?  

NADI: No. It's just that we were talking a couple of days ago and... I happened to mention to him where we were going- 

MOSES: -Wait, what?? 

TYE: You did what??  

NADI: ...It just came up. 

JEROME: (to Moses) But, I thought this was all supposed to be a secret? That we weren't gonna tell nobody?  

NADI: (defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation... 

MOSES: So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group... but, you're now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN, to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what you're asking me right now?  

NADI: Since when was this trip only for African-Americans? Am I American?  

MOSES: Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.  

NADI: But, he's- 

MOSES: -But, he's WHITE. A'right? What, you think he's the only cracker who wanted in on this? I turned down three non-black B.A.D.S. asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who ain't even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?  

CHANTAL: I met him... kinda.  

NADI: (sickened) ...I can't believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.  

MOSES: Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about- 

TYE: (to Nadi) -It's best if it's just- 

NADI: -Everyone SHUT UP!  

Nadi shrugs off Tye as him and Moses fall silent. She's clearly had this effect before.  

NADI (CONT'D): Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...  

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!' 

NADI (CONT'D): This group stands for 'The Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come with us, I initially said 'No' because he wasn't one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.  

MOSES: Wait, what?? 

CHANTAL: Seriously?  

TYE: Are you kidding me??  

NADI: (ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!  

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.  

MOSES: (unconvinced) A'right. Show me this cracker. 

Nadi looks blankly at him.  

MOSES (CONT'D): A picture - show me!  

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry together. ZOOMS in on Henry.  

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): I guess this brother's in the sunken place...  

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to Nadi) You're telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?  

NADI: If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then nobody in this room would be.  

BETH: OH DAMN! 

JEROME: Hey! Hey!  

TYE: (over noise) He still ain't a member!  

Tye's outburst silences the room.  

TYE (CONT'D): It's members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?  

MOSES: Right! Members only. Don't matter if he's African or not.  

NADI: He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' - he's both! I mean, the amount of times he's defended me - and all because some racist idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let him come, then... you can count me out as well.  

MOSES: What?-  

TYRONE: -What??  

Tye's turned his body fully towards Nadi.  

CHANTAL: Well, I ain't going if Nadi's not going.  

BETH: Great. So, I'm the only girl now? 

MOSES: What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...  

The whole room erupts into argument – all while Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him. 

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**  

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!  

TYE: Nadi! Nadi, wait!  

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.  

TYE (CONT'D): I told you, you were the only reason I was going...  

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment... 

NADI: Then you were going for the wrong reasons.  

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.  

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**  

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry is deep in sleep.  

INTERCUT WITH:  

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.  

BACK TO:  

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like he's having a bad dream. Then:  

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed by a LONG, SPARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:  

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping peacefully. Regains himself.  

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.  

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**  

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.  

HENRY: (to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is she this important to you? 

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.  

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to reflection) ...This is insane.  

FADE OUT. 

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is kind of a douche, isn’t he?  

Once again, I’m sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was badly written. The only regret I have with excluding those scenes was we didn’t get a proper introduction to Henry – he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of him in Part Three. 

Next week, we officially begin our journey up the Congo River and into the mysterious depths of the Rainforest... where the real horror finally begins. 

Before we end things this week, there are some things I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?... Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay. Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi if he could accompany the B.A.D.S. on their expedition. In reality, Henry didn’t ask Nadi if he could come along... Nadi asked him. Apparently, the reason Henry was invited on the trip (rather than weaselling his way into it) was because the group didn’t have enough members willing to join their commune – and so, they had to make do with Henry.  

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry’s call to adventure had to be a lot more interesting... That’s the real difference between storytelling and real life right there... Storytelling forces things to happen, whereas in real life... things just happen. 

Well, that’s everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where our journey into the “Heart of Darkness” will finally commence... 

Thanks for tuning in everyone, and until next time, this is the OP,

1nxa4dk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SalesTax/comments/1nxa4dk/california_sales_tax_on_cold_drinks/,California sales tax on cold drinks.,"I frequent a new coffee shop in my town that specializes in cold coffee and cold drinks. The only food they have is pastries/baked goods (different types of breads and coffee cakes). There’s no “dine-in” option but they do have seats like any other coffee shop.


This place charges sales tax on cold drinks and I cannot figure out why. I’ve emailed them (with no answer). 

What’s weird is that if I order on the app from Starbucks, Peet’s, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf or Philz Coffee, there’s no tax. This coffee shop and Dunkin, I get charged tax. 

What am I missing on why this place and Dunkin apply tax on cold coffee, to-go orders? ",1,1759523005.0,SalesTax,2,1.0,False
1nxa4a3,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1nxa4a3/the_first_3_minutes_after_you_wake_up_might/,The first 3 minutes after you wake up might decide how the rest of your day feels,"So I’ve been digging into some neuroscience stuff lately, and here’s something that really hit me:
the first few minutes after you wake up are way more important than we give them credit for.

When you’re just coming out of sleep, your brain is in this half-dream state (theta → alpha waves). Basically the same brain states people hit in meditation or hypnosis. Your mental chatter is still dialed down, and your brain’s “filter” system (the Reticular Activating System) is just booting up.

That filter literally decides what you notice during the day. And it takes its first cues from how you feel when you wake.
	•	If you roll out of bed anxious, your brain is primed to look for problems.
	•	If you wake up calm or grateful, your brain is primed to spot opportunities, good moments, or just things that feel safe.

It’s not magic. It’s attention bias + neuroplasticity. But it’s a bias that sticks.

So here’s what I started trying instead of doomscrolling first thing:
	•	Don’t touch the phone.
	•	Hand on chest, breathe slow for a minute.
	•	Think about one thing I’m genuinely grateful for (not fake “I’m grateful for my coffee” stuff, something that actually hits).
	•	Picture what I want the day to look like, like I’m running a mental rehearsal.
	•	Say a few words to myself as if I already did it.

Takes 2–3 minutes. Doesn’t solve your life overnight. But I’ll say this: the days I do it, I notice more good things, I’m less reactive, and I don’t start the morning in fight-or-flight.

Your first thoughts really are instructions. Might as well choose them.

What’s the very first thing you let into your head when you wake up—and does it set the tone for your day?

You know the type: beige cubicle, flickering fluorescent lights, the smell of burnt coffee, and that constant feeling of watching the clock tick down to 5 PM. I was barely making ends meet and had zero passion for what I was doing. Every Sunday night, a wave of dread would wash over me thinking about the week ahead.

One night, mindlessly scrolling through YouTube, I stumbled into the world of digital marketing. I watched a video about SEO, then another about Google Ads, and then fell down a rabbit hole of content strategy. It felt like discovering a secret level in a video game. I was fascinated by the idea that you could use data and creativity to help a business grow online. It was a mix of psychology, writing, and analytics that just… clicked. 

So, I started dedicating my nights and weekends to learning. I devoured every free course, blog post, and tutorial I could find. My first 'client' was my friend’s fledgling dog-walking business. I built them a simple website and used some basic local SEO tricks I’d learned. I’ll never forget the thrill of seeing her site pop up on the first page of Google for 'dog walker in [our town]'. She called me, ecstatic, because her phone was actually ringing with new customers. It felt like I had a superpower.

That small win gave me the confidence to start freelancing on the side. It was terrifying at first, dealing with imposter syndrome and quoting prices that felt way too high. But I stuck with it, and slowly but surely, it grew. Within a year, I was earning more from my 'side hustle' than my actual job. Quitting that soul-crushing office job was one of the most satisfying days of my entire life.

Now, I have my own small agency and the freedom to work from anywhere. It's not always easy, but it’s challenging, creative, and rewarding in a way my old job never was. All because of a random YouTube rabbit hole. It still blows my mind.

Welcome back for Part Two of this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free to check out Part One before continuing. 

So, last week we read the cold open to *ASILI*, which sets the tone nicely for what you can expect from this story. This week, we’ll finally be introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself. 

Like I mentioned last time, I’ll be omitting a handful of scenes here – not only because of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because... you’re only really here for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better! 

Before we start things off here, I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...  

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an adaptation of a real-life story – a very faithful adaptation I might add. The characters in this script were real people - as were the horrific things which happened to them. 

Well, without any further ado, let’s carry on with Henry’s story\] 

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**   

FADE IN:  

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilization...  

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear masks (deep into pandemic). The protestors CHANT:   

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...   

Almost everyone holds or waves signs - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace.  

Among the crowd:  

A GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER, which reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. 

Among these six are:   

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.   

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his neck-length dreadlocks.   

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured and model thin. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:   

RING RING RING.  

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her iPhone and pulls down her mask. Answers:  

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?   

She struggles to hear the other end.   

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?  

The girl next to her inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.   

CHANTAL: Have you told him?   

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.   

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...   

INTERCUT WITH:  

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**    

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said, I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?   

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.  

BACK TO:   

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.   

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?   

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call-  

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-  

Henry looks to his phone. Lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.   

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.   

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:   

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR' 

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**    

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S. sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the counter displays the NEWS.   

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are equal rights and, of course, the pandemic - but we cannot hide from the facts: global warming is at an all-time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is deforestation...   

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.   

A WAITRESS comes over...   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.   

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.  

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...   

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.   

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?   

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...  

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I dunno... It's just feeling... real all'er sudden. (to group) Right?   

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?   

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.   

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - basically his lapdog.   

BETH: Yeah. Me too...   

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.   

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.   

MOSES: Nadi, you're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this?  

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.   

NADI: Well... It just feels like we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights, whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this - without making a real contribution...   

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.  

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.   

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.   

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?   

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?   

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?' 

NADI: ...No-  

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...   

Everyone's clearly heard this speech before.   

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.   

Another awkward silence.   

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?   

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!   

The B.A.D.S. look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?   

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.   

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.   

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?' 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.   

The waitress brings over the six coffees.   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.   

JEROME: Yeah, me too.   

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.   

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?  

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!   

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:   

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?   

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.   

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...   

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...   

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.   

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?   

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.    

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**   

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.   

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:   

A large line has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people. Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.  

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.   

Then:   

PING.  

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...   

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:   

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to talk to U today. When's best for U??'   

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.   

**INT. HENRY’S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**   

\[Hey, it’s the OP here. Miss me?... Yeah, thought so. 

This is the first of four scenes I’ll be omitting in this post – but don’t worry, I’m going to give you a brief summary of the scenes instead.  

In this first scene, Henry goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi. Once they first try to make some rather awkward small talk, Nadi then tells Henry of her friends’ plan to start a commune in the rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both confused and rather pissed off by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship – and although Nadi doesn’t say it out loud, her silence basically confirms she’s breaking up with him. 

Well, now that’s out of the way, let’s continue to the next scene\] 

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**   

\[Yep - still here. 

I’m afraid this is another scene with some badly written dialogue. I promise this won’t be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue’s pretty much ok from there on.  

So, in this scene, we find Henry in a pub-restaurant sat amongst his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even douchier mates. Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene, and Ellie tries prying as to why he’s drinking his sorrows away. Ellie’s boyfriend and his mates then piss Henry off, causing him to drunkenly storm out the pub. 

The scene then transitions to Ellie driving Henry’s drunken ass home, all the while he complains about Nadi and her “woke” American activist friends. Trying desperately to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her douche of a boyfriend got a DNA test done online. I know this sounds like very random dialogue to include, and it definitely reads this way, but what Ellie says here is actually pretty important to the story – or what we screenwriters call a “plot point.”  

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back, her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going to). This revelation seems to spark something in Henry, causing him to get out of Ellie’s car and take the London Underground home\] 

**INT. NADI’S APARTMENT - BOSTON - NIGHT**    

\[Ok. I know you’re all getting sick of me excluding pieces of the story by now. But rest assured, this is the last time I’m going to do this for the remainder of the series. OP’s promise. 

In this final omitted scene, we find Nadi fast asleep in her bedroom. Her phone then rings where she wakes to Henry calling her. We also read here that Tye is asleep next to Nadi (what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry then asks Nadi if he can accompany the B.A.D.S. to the Congo. When Nadi says no to this due to the trip being for members only, Henry tells her about Ellie’s DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?) Henry basically tells Nadi this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because he’s also technically of African heritage. Although she’s amazed by this, Nadi still isn’t sure whether Henry can come with them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then transitions before Nadi can answer. 

Well, thank God that’s over and done with! Now we can carry on through the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\] 

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All the B.A.D.S. members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.  

MOSES: (interrupts) A’right. Let's get started. We gotta lot to cover...  

CHANTAL: Mo'. Nadi ain't here.  

MOSES: Well, we gonna have to start withou- 

The door opens on the far end: it's Nadi. Rather embarrassed - scurries down to the group. 

NADI: Sorry, I'm late.  

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.  

MOSES: Right. That's everyone? A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh - we're all signed up with that African missionary programme, right? Else how we all gonna get in? 

Everyone nods.  

BETH: Yeah. We signed up.  

MOSES (CONT'D): And we're all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid? 

Again, all nod.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (at whiteboard) A'right. So, I just wanted to make this a little more clear for y'all...  

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.  

MOSES (CONT'D): THIS: is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City. We'll be landing here...  

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): From the airport we'll get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The guy'll journey us up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...  

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): We'll get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days up river. Getting off...  

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): HERE: at the Mongala River. We'll then meet up with another guy. He'll guide us on foot through the interior. It'll take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest we'll call home. But once we're there - it's ours. It'll be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you don't even start... (pause) Any questions? 

JEROME: (hand up) Yeah... You sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?  

MOSES: Nah, it's cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty clean to me.  

Chantal raises her hand.  

MOSES: Yeah?  

CHANTAL: What about rebels? I was just checking online, and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...  

MOSES: (to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?  

Everyone's quiet. Then: 

Nadi. Her hand raised.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (sighs) Yeah?  

NADI: Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...  

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.  

NADI (CONT'D): If maybe Henry could come with us? 

 Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in shock.  

MOSES: Henry?  

NADI: My boyfriend... in the UK.  

MOSES: What? The white guy?  

NADI: My British boyfriend in the UK - yes.  

Moses pauses at this.  

MOSES: So, let me get this straight... You're asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend, can come on an ALL BLACK voyage into Africa?  

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.  

MOSES (CONT'D): What, is that a joke?  

NADI: No. It's just that we were talking a couple of days ago and... I happened to mention to him where we were going- 

MOSES: -Wait, what?? 

TYE: You did what??  

NADI: ...It just came up. 

JEROME: (to Moses) But, I thought this was all supposed to be a secret? That we weren't gonna tell nobody?  

NADI: (defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation... 

MOSES: So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group... but, you're now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN, to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what you're asking me right now?  

NADI: Since when was this trip only for African-Americans? Am I American?  

MOSES: Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.  

NADI: But, he's- 

MOSES: -But, he's WHITE. A'right? What, you think he's the only cracker who wanted in on this? I turned down three non-black B.A.D.S. asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who ain't even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?  

CHANTAL: I met him... kinda.  

NADI: (sickened) ...I can't believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.  

MOSES: Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about- 

TYE: (to Nadi) -It's best if it's just- 

NADI: -Everyone SHUT UP!  

Nadi shrugs off Tye as him and Moses fall silent. She's clearly had this effect before.  

NADI (CONT'D): Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...  

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!' 

NADI (CONT'D): This group stands for 'The Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come with us, I initially said 'No' because he wasn't one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.  

MOSES: Wait, what?? 

CHANTAL: Seriously?  

TYE: Are you kidding me??  

NADI: (ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!  

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.  

MOSES: (unconvinced) A'right. Show me this cracker. 

Nadi looks blankly at him.  

MOSES (CONT'D): A picture - show me!  

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry together. ZOOMS in on Henry.  

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): I guess this brother's in the sunken place...  

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to Nadi) You're telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?  

NADI: If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then nobody in this room would be.  

BETH: OH DAMN! 

JEROME: Hey! Hey!  

TYE: (over noise) He still ain't a member!  

Tye's outburst silences the room.  

TYE (CONT'D): It's members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?  

MOSES: Right! Members only. Don't matter if he's African or not.  

NADI: He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' - he's both! I mean, the amount of times he's defended me - and all because some racist idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let him come, then... you can count me out as well.  

MOSES: What?-  

TYRONE: -What??  

Tye's turned his body fully towards Nadi.  

CHANTAL: Well, I ain't going if Nadi's not going.  

BETH: Great. So, I'm the only girl now? 

MOSES: What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...  

The whole room erupts into argument – all while Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him. 

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**  

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!  

TYE: Nadi! Nadi, wait!  

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.  

TYE (CONT'D): I told you, you were the only reason I was going...  

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment... 

NADI: Then you were going for the wrong reasons.  

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.  

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**  

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry is deep in sleep.  

INTERCUT WITH:  

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.  

BACK TO:  

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like he's having a bad dream. Then:  

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed by a LONG, SPARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:  

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping peacefully. Regains himself.  

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.  

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**  

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.  

HENRY: (to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is she this important to you? 

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.  

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to reflection) ...This is insane.  

FADE OUT. 

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is kind of a douche, isn’t he?  

Once again, I’m sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was badly written. The only regret I have with excluding those scenes was we didn’t get a proper introduction to Henry – he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of him in Part Three. 

Next week, we officially begin our journey up the Congo River and into the mysterious depths of the Rainforest... where the real horror finally begins. 

Before we end things this week, there are some things I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?... Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay. Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi if he could accompany the B.A.D.S. on their expedition. In reality, Henry didn’t ask Nadi if he could come along... Nadi asked him. Apparently, the reason Henry was invited on the trip (rather than weaselling his way into it) was because the group didn’t have enough members willing to join their commune – and so, they had to make do with Henry.  

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry’s call to adventure had to be a lot more interesting... That’s the real difference between storytelling and real life right there... Storytelling forces things to happen, whereas in real life... things just happen. 

Well, that’s everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where our journey into the “Heart of Darkness” will finally commence... 

Thanks for tuning in everyone, and until next time, this is the OP,

What is your favorite matcha customization?

Some people have it with honey instead of vanilla; or raspberry; or extra matcha and no sweetener (how bitter is that?). You got your blended matcha with espresso. And the demure matcha with mint. My current morbid curiosity is spicy matcha (matcha with vanilla and spicy mix); I like it both hot and cold.

\[Hello again everyone! 

Welcome back for Part Two of this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free to check out Part One before continuing. 

So, last week we read the cold open to *ASILI*, which sets the tone nicely for what you can expect from this story. This week, we’ll finally be introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself. 

Like I mentioned last time, I’ll be omitting a handful of scenes here – not only because of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because... you’re only really here for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better! 

Before we start things off here, I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...  

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an adaptation of a real-life story – a very faithful adaptation I might add. The characters in this script were real people - as were the horrific things which happened to them. 

Well, without any further ado, let’s carry on with Henry’s story\] 

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**   

FADE IN:  

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilization...  

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear masks (deep into pandemic). The protestors CHANT:   

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...   

Almost everyone holds or waves signs - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace.  

Among the crowd:  

A GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER, which reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. 

Among these six are:   

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.   

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his neck-length dreadlocks.   

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured and model thin. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:   

RING RING RING.  

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her iPhone and pulls down her mask. Answers:  

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?   

She struggles to hear the other end.   

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?  

The girl next to her inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.   

CHANTAL: Have you told him?   

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.   

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...   

INTERCUT WITH:  

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**    

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said, I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?   

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.  

BACK TO:   

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.   

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?   

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call-  

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-  

Henry looks to his phone. Lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.   

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.   

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:   

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR' 

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**    

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S. sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the counter displays the NEWS.   

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are equal rights and, of course, the pandemic - but we cannot hide from the facts: global warming is at an all-time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is deforestation...   

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.   

A WAITRESS comes over...   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.   

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.  

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...   

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.   

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?   

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...  

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I dunno... It's just feeling... real all'er sudden. (to group) Right?   

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?   

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.   

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - basically his lapdog.   

BETH: Yeah. Me too...   

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.   

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.   

MOSES: Nadi, you're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this?  

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.   

NADI: Well... It just feels like we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights, whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this - without making a real contribution...   

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.  

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.   

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.   

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?   

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?   

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?' 

NADI: ...No-  

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...   

Everyone's clearly heard this speech before.   

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.   

Another awkward silence.   

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?   

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!   

The B.A.D.S. look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?   

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.   

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.   

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?' 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.   

The waitress brings over the six coffees.   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.   

JEROME: Yeah, me too.   

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.   

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?  

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!   

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:   

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?   

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.   

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...   

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...   

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.   

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?   

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.    

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**   

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.   

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:   

A large line has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people. Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.  

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.   

Then:   

PING.  

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...   

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:   

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to talk to U today. When's best for U??'   

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.   

**INT. HENRY’S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**   

\[Hey, it’s the OP here. Miss me?... Yeah, thought so. 

This is the first of four scenes I’ll be omitting in this post – but don’t worry, I’m going to give you a brief summary of the scenes instead.  

In this first scene, Henry goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi. Once they first try to make some rather awkward small talk, Nadi then tells Henry of her friends’ plan to start a commune in the rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both confused and rather pissed off by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship – and although Nadi doesn’t say it out loud, her silence basically confirms she’s breaking up with him. 

Well, now that’s out of the way, let’s continue to the next scene\] 

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**   

\[Yep - still here. 

I’m afraid this is another scene with some badly written dialogue. I promise this won’t be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue’s pretty much ok from there on.  

So, in this scene, we find Henry in a pub-restaurant sat amongst his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even douchier mates. Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene, and Ellie tries prying as to why he’s drinking his sorrows away. Ellie’s boyfriend and his mates then piss Henry off, causing him to drunkenly storm out the pub. 

The scene then transitions to Ellie driving Henry’s drunken ass home, all the while he complains about Nadi and her “woke” American activist friends. Trying desperately to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her douche of a boyfriend got a DNA test done online. I know this sounds like very random dialogue to include, and it definitely reads this way, but what Ellie says here is actually pretty important to the story – or what we screenwriters call a “plot point.”  

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back, her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going to). This revelation seems to spark something in Henry, causing him to get out of Ellie’s car and take the London Underground home\] 

**INT. NADI’S APARTMENT - BOSTON - NIGHT**    

\[Ok. I know you’re all getting sick of me excluding pieces of the story by now. But rest assured, this is the last time I’m going to do this for the remainder of the series. OP’s promise. 

In this final omitted scene, we find Nadi fast asleep in her bedroom. Her phone then rings where she wakes to Henry calling her. We also read here that Tye is asleep next to Nadi (what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry then asks Nadi if he can accompany the B.A.D.S. to the Congo. When Nadi says no to this due to the trip being for members only, Henry tells her about Ellie’s DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?) Henry basically tells Nadi this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because he’s also technically of African heritage. Although she’s amazed by this, Nadi still isn’t sure whether Henry can come with them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then transitions before Nadi can answer. 

Well, thank God that’s over and done with! Now we can carry on through the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\] 

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All the B.A.D.S. members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.  

MOSES: (interrupts) A’right. Let's get started. We gotta lot to cover...  

CHANTAL: Mo'. Nadi ain't here.  

MOSES: Well, we gonna have to start withou- 

The door opens on the far end: it's Nadi. Rather embarrassed - scurries down to the group. 

NADI: Sorry, I'm late.  

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.  

MOSES: Right. That's everyone? A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh - we're all signed up with that African missionary programme, right? Else how we all gonna get in? 

Everyone nods.  

BETH: Yeah. We signed up.  

MOSES (CONT'D): And we're all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid? 

Again, all nod.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (at whiteboard) A'right. So, I just wanted to make this a little more clear for y'all...  

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.  

MOSES (CONT'D): THIS: is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City. We'll be landing here...  

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): From the airport we'll get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The guy'll journey us up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...  

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): We'll get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days up river. Getting off...  

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): HERE: at the Mongala River. We'll then meet up with another guy. He'll guide us on foot through the interior. It'll take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest we'll call home. But once we're there - it's ours. It'll be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you don't even start... (pause) Any questions? 

JEROME: (hand up) Yeah... You sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?  

MOSES: Nah, it's cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty clean to me.  

Chantal raises her hand.  

MOSES: Yeah?  

CHANTAL: What about rebels? I was just checking online, and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...  

MOSES: (to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?  

Everyone's quiet. Then: 

Nadi. Her hand raised.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (sighs) Yeah?  

NADI: Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...  

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.  

NADI (CONT'D): If maybe Henry could come with us? 

 Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in shock.  

MOSES: Henry?  

NADI: My boyfriend... in the UK.  

MOSES: What? The white guy?  

NADI: My British boyfriend in the UK - yes.  

Moses pauses at this.  

MOSES: So, let me get this straight... You're asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend, can come on an ALL BLACK voyage into Africa?  

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.  

MOSES (CONT'D): What, is that a joke?  

NADI: No. It's just that we were talking a couple of days ago and... I happened to mention to him where we were going- 

MOSES: -Wait, what?? 

TYE: You did what??  

NADI: ...It just came up. 

JEROME: (to Moses) But, I thought this was all supposed to be a secret? That we weren't gonna tell nobody?  

NADI: (defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation... 

MOSES: So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group... but, you're now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN, to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what you're asking me right now?  

NADI: Since when was this trip only for African-Americans? Am I American?  

MOSES: Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.  

NADI: But, he's- 

MOSES: -But, he's WHITE. A'right? What, you think he's the only cracker who wanted in on this? I turned down three non-black B.A.D.S. asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who ain't even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?  

CHANTAL: I met him... kinda.  

NADI: (sickened) ...I can't believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.  

MOSES: Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about- 

TYE: (to Nadi) -It's best if it's just- 

NADI: -Everyone SHUT UP!  

Nadi shrugs off Tye as him and Moses fall silent. She's clearly had this effect before.  

NADI (CONT'D): Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...  

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!' 

NADI (CONT'D): This group stands for 'The Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come with us, I initially said 'No' because he wasn't one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.  

MOSES: Wait, what?? 

CHANTAL: Seriously?  

TYE: Are you kidding me??  

NADI: (ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!  

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.  

MOSES: (unconvinced) A'right. Show me this cracker. 

Nadi looks blankly at him.  

MOSES (CONT'D): A picture - show me!  

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry together. ZOOMS in on Henry.  

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): I guess this brother's in the sunken place...  

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to Nadi) You're telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?  

NADI: If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then nobody in this room would be.  

BETH: OH DAMN! 

JEROME: Hey! Hey!  

TYE: (over noise) He still ain't a member!  

Tye's outburst silences the room.  

TYE (CONT'D): It's members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?  

MOSES: Right! Members only. Don't matter if he's African or not.  

NADI: He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' - he's both! I mean, the amount of times he's defended me - and all because some racist idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let him come, then... you can count me out as well.  

MOSES: What?-  

TYRONE: -What??  

Tye's turned his body fully towards Nadi.  

CHANTAL: Well, I ain't going if Nadi's not going.  

BETH: Great. So, I'm the only girl now? 

MOSES: What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...  

The whole room erupts into argument – all while Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him. 

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**  

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!  

TYE: Nadi! Nadi, wait!  

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.  

TYE (CONT'D): I told you, you were the only reason I was going...  

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment... 

NADI: Then you were going for the wrong reasons.  

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.  

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**  

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry is deep in sleep.  

INTERCUT WITH:  

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.  

BACK TO:  

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like he's having a bad dream. Then:  

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed by a LONG, SPARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:  

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping peacefully. Regains himself.  

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.  

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**  

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.  

HENRY: (to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is she this important to you? 

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.  

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to reflection) ...This is insane.  

FADE OUT. 

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is kind of a douche, isn’t he?  

Once again, I’m sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was badly written. The only regret I have with excluding those scenes was we didn’t get a proper introduction to Henry – he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of him in Part Three. 

Next week, we officially begin our journey up the Congo River and into the mysterious depths of the Rainforest... where the real horror finally begins. 

Before we end things this week, there are some things I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?... Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay. Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi if he could accompany the B.A.D.S. on their expedition. In reality, Henry didn’t ask Nadi if he could come along... Nadi asked him. Apparently, the reason Henry was invited on the trip (rather than weaselling his way into it) was because the group didn’t have enough members willing to join their commune – and so, they had to make do with Henry.  

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry’s call to adventure had to be a lot more interesting... That’s the real difference between storytelling and real life right there... Storytelling forces things to happen, whereas in real life... things just happen. 

Well, that’s everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where our journey into the “Heart of Darkness” will finally commence... 

Thanks for tuning in everyone, and until next time, this is the OP,

Would offering help be weird?,"**Backstory**: We’d been talking on a dating app on/off for a year but finally met in person the other day with perfect timing (long story). Our date went REALLY well. Yesterday the day of his surgery, he wanted to see me and buy me coffee in the morning so that was date number 2. Needless to say we’re both really into eachother and have a lot of chemistry.

**My question** - Should I offer help or mind my business and not be too forward? If a guy had surgery I’m sure the last thing he’d want is for his love interest to see him all drugged on strong pain medication lol. I may be wrong. Might not even want me knowing where he lives. When we met for coffee I said “Aw I wont see you for a week or so” and I could already see the gears going in his head of how he could shorten that. 😆

What do you think and if I should, any ideas?

UPDATE: His mom flew in to take care of him for the next few weeks. He appreciated the fact that I thought of him in that way, so I’ll take the win 🤭 Thanks everyone!",18,1759522770.0,dating_advice,57,0.92,False

I Just Read a Script Based on My Childhood Best Friend [Pt 2],"[\[Part 1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Viidith22/comments/1nrcism/i_work_for_a_horror_movie_studio_i_just_read_a/)

\[Hello again everyone! 

Welcome back for Part Two of this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free to check out Part One before continuing. 

So, last week we read the cold open to *ASILI*, which sets the tone nicely for what you can expect from this story. This week, we’ll finally be introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself. 

Like I mentioned last time, I’ll be omitting a handful of scenes here – not only because of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because... you’re only really here for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better! 

Before we start things off here, I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...  

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an adaptation of a real-life story – a very faithful adaptation I might add. The characters in this script were real people - as were the horrific things which happened to them. 

Well, without any further ado, let’s carry on with Henry’s story\] 

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**   

FADE IN:  

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilization...  

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear masks (deep into pandemic). The protestors CHANT:   

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...   

Almost everyone holds or waves signs - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace.  

Among the crowd:  

A GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER, which reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. 

Among these six are:   

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.   

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his neck-length dreadlocks.   

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured and model thin. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:   

RING RING RING.  

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her iPhone and pulls down her mask. Answers:  

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?   

She struggles to hear the other end.   

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?  

The girl next to her inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.   

CHANTAL: Have you told him?   

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.   

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...   

INTERCUT WITH:  

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**    

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said, I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?   

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.  

BACK TO:   

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.   

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?   

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call-  

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-  

Henry looks to his phone. Lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.   

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.   

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:   

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR' 

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**    

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S. sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the counter displays the NEWS.   

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are equal rights and, of course, the pandemic - but we cannot hide from the facts: global warming is at an all-time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is deforestation...   

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.   

A WAITRESS comes over...   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.   

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.  

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...   

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.   

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?   

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...  

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I dunno... It's just feeling... real all'er sudden. (to group) Right?   

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?   

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.   

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - basically his lapdog.   

BETH: Yeah. Me too...   

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.   

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.   

MOSES: Nadi, you're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this?  

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.   

NADI: Well... It just feels like we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights, whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this - without making a real contribution...   

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.  

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.   

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.   

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?   

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?   

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?' 

NADI: ...No-  

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...   

Everyone's clearly heard this speech before.   

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.   

Another awkward silence.   

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?   

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!   

The B.A.D.S. look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?   

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.   

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.   

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?' 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.   

The waitress brings over the six coffees.   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.   

JEROME: Yeah, me too.   

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.   

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?  

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!   

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:   

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?   

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.   

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...   

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...   

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.   

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?   

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.    

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**   

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.   

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:   

A large line has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people. Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.  

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.   

Then:   

PING.  

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...   

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:   

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to talk to U today. When's best for U??'   

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.   

**INT. HENRY’S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**   

\[Hey, it’s the OP here. Miss me?... Yeah, thought so. 

This is the first of four scenes I’ll be omitting in this post – but don’t worry, I’m going to give you a brief summary of the scenes instead.  

In this first scene, Henry goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi. Once they first try to make some rather awkward small talk, Nadi then tells Henry of her friends’ plan to start a commune in the rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both confused and rather pissed off by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship – and although Nadi doesn’t say it out loud, her silence basically confirms she’s breaking up with him. 

Well, now that’s out of the way, let’s continue to the next scene\] 

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**   

\[Yep - still here. 

I’m afraid this is another scene with some badly written dialogue. I promise this won’t be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue’s pretty much ok from there on.  

So, in this scene, we find Henry in a pub-restaurant sat amongst his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even douchier mates. Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene, and Ellie tries prying as to why he’s drinking his sorrows away. Ellie’s boyfriend and his mates then piss Henry off, causing him to drunkenly storm out the pub. 

The scene then transitions to Ellie driving Henry’s drunken ass home, all the while he complains about Nadi and her “woke” American activist friends. Trying desperately to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her douche of a boyfriend got a DNA test done online. I know this sounds like very random dialogue to include, and it definitely reads this way, but what Ellie says here is actually pretty important to the story – or what we screenwriters call a “plot point.”  

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back, her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going to). This revelation seems to spark something in Henry, causing him to get out of Ellie’s car and take the London Underground home\] 

**INT. NADI’S APARTMENT - BOSTON - NIGHT**    

\[Ok. I know you’re all getting sick of me excluding pieces of the story by now. But rest assured, this is the last time I’m going to do this for the remainder of the series. OP’s promise. 

In this final omitted scene, we find Nadi fast asleep in her bedroom. Her phone then rings where she wakes to Henry calling her. We also read here that Tye is asleep next to Nadi (what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry then asks Nadi if he can accompany the B.A.D.S. to the Congo. When Nadi says no to this due to the trip being for members only, Henry tells her about Ellie’s DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?) Henry basically tells Nadi this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because he’s also technically of African heritage. Although she’s amazed by this, Nadi still isn’t sure whether Henry can come with them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then transitions before Nadi can answer. 

Well, thank God that’s over and done with! Now we can carry on through the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\] 

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All the B.A.D.S. members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.  

MOSES: (interrupts) A’right. Let's get started. We gotta lot to cover...  

CHANTAL: Mo'. Nadi ain't here.  

MOSES: Well, we gonna have to start withou- 

The door opens on the far end: it's Nadi. Rather embarrassed - scurries down to the group. 

NADI: Sorry, I'm late.  

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.  

MOSES: Right. That's everyone? A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh - we're all signed up with that African missionary programme, right? Else how we all gonna get in? 

Everyone nods.  

BETH: Yeah. We signed up.  

MOSES (CONT'D): And we're all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid? 

Again, all nod.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (at whiteboard) A'right. So, I just wanted to make this a little more clear for y'all...  

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.  

MOSES (CONT'D): THIS: is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City. We'll be landing here...  

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): From the airport we'll get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The guy'll journey us up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...  

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): We'll get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days up river. Getting off...  

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): HERE: at the Mongala River. We'll then meet up with another guy. He'll guide us on foot through the interior. It'll take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest we'll call home. But once we're there - it's ours. It'll be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you don't even start... (pause) Any questions? 

JEROME: (hand up) Yeah... You sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?  

MOSES: Nah, it's cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty clean to me.  

Chantal raises her hand.  

MOSES: Yeah?  

CHANTAL: What about rebels? I was just checking online, and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...  

MOSES: (to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?  

Everyone's quiet. Then: 

Nadi. Her hand raised.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (sighs) Yeah?  

NADI: Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...  

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.  

NADI (CONT'D): If maybe Henry could come with us? 

 Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in shock.  

MOSES: Henry?  

NADI: My boyfriend... in the UK.  

MOSES: What? The white guy?  

NADI: My British boyfriend in the UK - yes.  

Moses pauses at this.  

MOSES: So, let me get this straight... You're asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend, can come on an ALL BLACK voyage into Africa?  

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.  

MOSES (CONT'D): What, is that a joke?  

NADI: No. It's just that we were talking a couple of days ago and... I happened to mention to him where we were going- 

MOSES: -Wait, what?? 

TYE: You did what??  

NADI: ...It just came up. 

JEROME: (to Moses) But, I thought this was all supposed to be a secret? That we weren't gonna tell nobody?  

NADI: (defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation... 

MOSES: So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group... but, you're now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN, to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what you're asking me right now?  

NADI: Since when was this trip only for African-Americans? Am I American?  

MOSES: Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.  

NADI: But, he's- 

MOSES: -But, he's WHITE. A'right? What, you think he's the only cracker who wanted in on this? I turned down three non-black B.A.D.S. asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who ain't even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?  

CHANTAL: I met him... kinda.  

NADI: (sickened) ...I can't believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.  

MOSES: Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about- 

TYE: (to Nadi) -It's best if it's just- 

NADI: -Everyone SHUT UP!  

Nadi shrugs off Tye as him and Moses fall silent. She's clearly had this effect before.  

NADI (CONT'D): Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...  

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!' 

NADI (CONT'D): This group stands for 'The Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come with us, I initially said 'No' because he wasn't one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.  

MOSES: Wait, what?? 

CHANTAL: Seriously?  

TYE: Are you kidding me??  

NADI: (ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!  

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.  

MOSES: (unconvinced) A'right. Show me this cracker. 

Nadi looks blankly at him.  

MOSES (CONT'D): A picture - show me!  

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry together. ZOOMS in on Henry.  

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): I guess this brother's in the sunken place...  

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to Nadi) You're telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?  

NADI: If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then nobody in this room would be.  

BETH: OH DAMN! 

JEROME: Hey! Hey!  

TYE: (over noise) He still ain't a member!  

Tye's outburst silences the room.  

TYE (CONT'D): It's members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?  

MOSES: Right! Members only. Don't matter if he's African or not.  

NADI: He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' - he's both! I mean, the amount of times he's defended me - and all because some racist idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let him come, then... you can count me out as well.  

MOSES: What?-  

TYRONE: -What??  

Tye's turned his body fully towards Nadi.  

CHANTAL: Well, I ain't going if Nadi's not going.  

BETH: Great. So, I'm the only girl now? 

MOSES: What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...  

The whole room erupts into argument – all while Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him. 

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**  

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!  

TYE: Nadi! Nadi, wait!  

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.  

TYE (CONT'D): I told you, you were the only reason I was going...  

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment... 

NADI: Then you were going for the wrong reasons.  

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.  

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**  

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry is deep in sleep.  

INTERCUT WITH:  

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.  

BACK TO:  

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like he's having a bad dream. Then:  

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed by a LONG, SPARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:  

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping peacefully. Regains himself.  

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.  

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**  

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.  

HENRY: (to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is she this important to you? 

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.  

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to reflection) ...This is insane.  

FADE OUT. 

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is kind of a douche, isn’t he?  

Once again, I’m sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was badly written. The only regret I have with excluding those scenes was we didn’t get a proper introduction to Henry – he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of him in Part Three. 

Next week, we officially begin our journey up the Congo River and into the mysterious depths of the Rainforest... where the real horror finally begins. 

Before we end things this week, there are some things I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?... Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay. Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi if he could accompany the B.A.D.S. on their expedition. In reality, Henry didn’t ask Nadi if he could come along... Nadi asked him. Apparently, the reason Henry was invited on the trip (rather than weaselling his way into it) was because the group didn’t have enough members willing to join their commune – and so, they had to make do with Henry.  

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry’s call to adventure had to be a lot more interesting... That’s the real difference between storytelling and real life right there... Storytelling forces things to happen, whereas in real life... things just happen. 

Well, that’s everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where our journey into the “Heart of Darkness” will finally commence... 

Thanks for tuning in everyone, and until next time, this is the OP,

\[Hello again everyone! 

Welcome back for Part Two of this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free to check out Part One before continuing. 

So, last week we read the cold open to *ASILI*, which sets the tone nicely for what you can expect from this story. This week, we’ll finally be introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself. 

Like I mentioned last time, I’ll be omitting a handful of scenes here – not only because of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because... you’re only really here for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better! 

Before we start things off here, I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...  

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an adaptation of a real-life story – a very faithful adaptation I might add. The characters in this script were real people - as were the horrific things which happened to them. 

Well, without any further ado, let’s carry on with Henry’s story\] 

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**   

FADE IN:  

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilization...  

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear masks (deep into pandemic). The protestors CHANT:   

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...   

Almost everyone holds or waves signs - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace.  

Among the crowd:  

A GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER, which reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. 

Among these six are:   

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.   

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his neck-length dreadlocks.   

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured and model thin. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:   

RING RING RING.  

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her iPhone and pulls down her mask. Answers:  

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?   

She struggles to hear the other end.   

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?  

The girl next to her inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.   

CHANTAL: Have you told him?   

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.   

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...   

INTERCUT WITH:  

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**    

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said, I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?   

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.  

BACK TO:   

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.   

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?   

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call-  

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-  

Henry looks to his phone. Lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.   

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.   

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:   

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR' 

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**    

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S. sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the counter displays the NEWS.   

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are equal rights and, of course, the pandemic - but we cannot hide from the facts: global warming is at an all-time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is deforestation...   

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.   

A WAITRESS comes over...   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.   

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.  

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...   

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.   

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?   

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...  

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I dunno... It's just feeling... real all'er sudden. (to group) Right?   

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?   

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.   

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - basically his lapdog.   

BETH: Yeah. Me too...   

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.   

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.   

MOSES: Nadi, you're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this?  

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.   

NADI: Well... It just feels like we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights, whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this - without making a real contribution...   

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.  

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.   

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.   

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?   

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?   

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?' 

NADI: ...No-  

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...   

Everyone's clearly heard this speech before.   

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.   

Another awkward silence.   

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?   

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!   

The B.A.D.S. look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?   

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.   

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.   

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?' 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.   

The waitress brings over the six coffees.   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.   

JEROME: Yeah, me too.   

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.   

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?  

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!   

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:   

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?   

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.   

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...   

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...   

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.   

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?   

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.    

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**   

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.   

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:   

A large line has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people. Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.  

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.   

Then:   

PING.  

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...   

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:   

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to talk to U today. When's best for U??'   

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.   

**INT. HENRY’S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**   

\[Hey, it’s the OP here. Miss me?... Yeah, thought so. 

This is the first of four scenes I’ll be omitting in this post – but don’t worry, I’m going to give you a brief summary of the scenes instead.  

In this first scene, Henry goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi. Once they first try to make some rather awkward small talk, Nadi then tells Henry of her friends’ plan to start a commune in the rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both confused and rather pissed off by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship – and although Nadi doesn’t say it out loud, her silence basically confirms she’s breaking up with him. 

Well, now that’s out of the way, let’s continue to the next scene\] 

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**   

\[Yep - still here. 

I’m afraid this is another scene with some badly written dialogue. I promise this won’t be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue’s pretty much ok from there on.  

So, in this scene, we find Henry in a pub-restaurant sat amongst his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even douchier mates. Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene, and Ellie tries prying as to why he’s drinking his sorrows away. Ellie’s boyfriend and his mates then piss Henry off, causing him to drunkenly storm out the pub. 

The scene then transitions to Ellie driving Henry’s drunken ass home, all the while he complains about Nadi and her “woke” American activist friends. Trying desperately to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her douche of a boyfriend got a DNA test done online. I know this sounds like very random dialogue to include, and it definitely reads this way, but what Ellie says here is actually pretty important to the story – or what we screenwriters call a “plot point.”  

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back, her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going to). This revelation seems to spark something in Henry, causing him to get out of Ellie’s car and take the London Underground home\] 

**INT. NADI’S APARTMENT - BOSTON - NIGHT**    

\[Ok. I know you’re all getting sick of me excluding pieces of the story by now. But rest assured, this is the last time I’m going to do this for the remainder of the series. OP’s promise. 

In this final omitted scene, we find Nadi fast asleep in her bedroom. Her phone then rings where she wakes to Henry calling her. We also read here that Tye is asleep next to Nadi (what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry then asks Nadi if he can accompany the B.A.D.S. to the Congo. When Nadi says no to this due to the trip being for members only, Henry tells her about Ellie’s DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?) Henry basically tells Nadi this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because he’s also technically of African heritage. Although she’s amazed by this, Nadi still isn’t sure whether Henry can come with them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then transitions before Nadi can answer. 

Well, thank God that’s over and done with! Now we can carry on through the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\] 

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All the B.A.D.S. members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.  

MOSES: (interrupts) A’right. Let's get started. We gotta lot to cover...  

CHANTAL: Mo'. Nadi ain't here.  

MOSES: Well, we gonna have to start withou- 

The door opens on the far end: it's Nadi. Rather embarrassed - scurries down to the group. 

NADI: Sorry, I'm late.  

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.  

MOSES: Right. That's everyone? A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh - we're all signed up with that African missionary programme, right? Else how we all gonna get in? 

Everyone nods.  

BETH: Yeah. We signed up.  

MOSES (CONT'D): And we're all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid? 

Again, all nod.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (at whiteboard) A'right. So, I just wanted to make this a little more clear for y'all...  

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.  

MOSES (CONT'D): THIS: is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City. We'll be landing here...  

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): From the airport we'll get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The guy'll journey us up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...  

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): We'll get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days up river. Getting off...  

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): HERE: at the Mongala River. We'll then meet up with another guy. He'll guide us on foot through the interior. It'll take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest we'll call home. But once we're there - it's ours. It'll be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you don't even start... (pause) Any questions? 

JEROME: (hand up) Yeah... You sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?  

MOSES: Nah, it's cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty clean to me.  

Chantal raises her hand.  

MOSES: Yeah?  

CHANTAL: What about rebels? I was just checking online, and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...  

MOSES: (to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?  

Everyone's quiet. Then: 

Nadi. Her hand raised.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (sighs) Yeah?  

NADI: Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...  

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.  

NADI (CONT'D): If maybe Henry could come with us? 

 Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in shock.  

MOSES: Henry?  

NADI: My boyfriend... in the UK.  

MOSES: What? The white guy?  

NADI: My British boyfriend in the UK - yes.  

Moses pauses at this.  

MOSES: So, let me get this straight... You're asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend, can come on an ALL BLACK voyage into Africa?  

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.  

MOSES (CONT'D): What, is that a joke?  

NADI: No. It's just that we were talking a couple of days ago and... I happened to mention to him where we were going- 

MOSES: -Wait, what?? 

TYE: You did what??  

NADI: ...It just came up. 

JEROME: (to Moses) But, I thought this was all supposed to be a secret? That we weren't gonna tell nobody?  

NADI: (defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation... 

MOSES: So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group... but, you're now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN, to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what you're asking me right now?  

NADI: Since when was this trip only for African-Americans? Am I American?  

MOSES: Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.  

NADI: But, he's- 

MOSES: -But, he's WHITE. A'right? What, you think he's the only cracker who wanted in on this? I turned down three non-black B.A.D.S. asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who ain't even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?  

CHANTAL: I met him... kinda.  

NADI: (sickened) ...I can't believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.  

MOSES: Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about- 

TYE: (to Nadi) -It's best if it's just- 

NADI: -Everyone SHUT UP!  

Nadi shrugs off Tye as him and Moses fall silent. She's clearly had this effect before.  

NADI (CONT'D): Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...  

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!' 

NADI (CONT'D): This group stands for 'The Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come with us, I initially said 'No' because he wasn't one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.  

MOSES: Wait, what?? 

CHANTAL: Seriously?  

TYE: Are you kidding me??  

NADI: (ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!  

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.  

MOSES: (unconvinced) A'right. Show me this cracker. 

Nadi looks blankly at him.  

MOSES (CONT'D): A picture - show me!  

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry together. ZOOMS in on Henry.  

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): I guess this brother's in the sunken place...  

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to Nadi) You're telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?  

NADI: If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then nobody in this room would be.  

BETH: OH DAMN! 

JEROME: Hey! Hey!  

TYE: (over noise) He still ain't a member!  

Tye's outburst silences the room.  

TYE (CONT'D): It's members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?  

MOSES: Right! Members only. Don't matter if he's African or not.  

NADI: He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' - he's both! I mean, the amount of times he's defended me - and all because some racist idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let him come, then... you can count me out as well.  

MOSES: What?-  

TYRONE: -What??  

Tye's turned his body fully towards Nadi.  

CHANTAL: Well, I ain't going if Nadi's not going.  

BETH: Great. So, I'm the only girl now? 

MOSES: What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...  

The whole room erupts into argument – all while Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him. 

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**  

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!  

TYE: Nadi! Nadi, wait!  

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.  

TYE (CONT'D): I told you, you were the only reason I was going...  

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment... 

NADI: Then you were going for the wrong reasons.  

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.  

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**  

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry is deep in sleep.  

INTERCUT WITH:  

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.  

BACK TO:  

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like he's having a bad dream. Then:  

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed by a LONG, SPARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:  

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping peacefully. Regains himself.  

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.  

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**  

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.  

HENRY: (to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is she this important to you? 

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.  

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to reflection) ...This is insane.  

FADE OUT. 

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is kind of a douche, isn’t he?  

Once again, I’m sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was badly written. The only regret I have with excluding those scenes was we didn’t get a proper introduction to Henry – he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of him in Part Three. 

Next week, we officially begin our journey up the Congo River and into the mysterious depths of the Rainforest... where the real horror finally begins. 

Before we end things this week, there are some things I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?... Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay. Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi if he could accompany the B.A.D.S. on their expedition. In reality, Henry didn’t ask Nadi if he could come along... Nadi asked him. Apparently, the reason Henry was invited on the trip (rather than weaselling his way into it) was because the group didn’t have enough members willing to join their commune – and so, they had to make do with Henry.  

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry’s call to adventure had to be a lot more interesting... That’s the real difference between storytelling and real life right there... Storytelling forces things to happen, whereas in real life... things just happen. 

Well, that’s everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where our journey into the “Heart of Darkness” will finally commence... 

Thanks for tuning in everyone, and until next time, this is the OP,

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!), maybe slightly flirty if things go that way naturally. I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",0,1759522504.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.5,False

It’s really frustrating for me bc it dries to her actual ASSHOLE and then she walks around with a shitty butt 😖😖 

Anytime I notice I try to wipe her butt with warm, damp, tissue/paper towel and soap if it’s really bad. but this does not encourage her to clean her butt as i’ve read before. I’m really annoyed because I do let her up on surfaces (coffee table, desk, table) because I clean my apartment almost daily, absolutely not the counters tho. But it grosses me out (obviously) when i’m just sitting doing my makeup and she walks on the desk and sits with me and then leaves and flashes fucking dingleberry park in my face!!!! 

Idk what to do, I don’t want to spray her ass (she hates it), I feel like i’m molesting my cat anytime I need to wipe her ass (which is ALWAYS) because it takes 1-2 pieces of paper towel or tissue paper and she doesn’t clean up herself afterwards anyways 😭😭 it’s not ever stuck to fur it’s always her actual b hole 🕳️ like OMG 🫥

\[Hello again everyone! 

Welcome back for Part Two of this series. If you happen to be new here, feel free to check out Part One before continuing. 

So, last week we read the cold open to *ASILI*, which sets the tone nicely for what you can expect from this story. This week, we’ll finally be introduced to our main characters: the American activists, and of course, Henry himself. 

Like I mentioned last time, I’ll be omitting a handful of scenes here – not only because of some pretty cringe dialogue, but because... you’re only really here for the horror, right? And the quicker we get to it, or at least, the adventure part of the story, the better! 

Before we start things off here, I just need to repeat something from last week in case anyone forgets...  

This screenplay, although fictitious, is an adaptation of a real-life story – a very faithful adaptation I might add. The characters in this script were real people - as were the horrific things which happened to them. 

Well, without any further ado, let’s carry on with Henry’s story\] 

**EXT. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - STREETS - AFTERNOON**   

FADE IN:  

We leave the mass of endless jungle for a mass gathering of civilization...  

A long BOSTON STREET. Filled completely with PROTESTING PEOPLE. Most wear masks (deep into pandemic). The protestors CHANT:   

PROTESTORS: BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!...   

Almost everyone holds or waves signs - they read: 'BLM','I CAN'T BREATHE', 'JUSTICE NOW!', etc. POLICEMEN keep the peace.  

Among the crowd:  

A GROUP of SIX PROTESTORS. THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN (all BLACK, early to mid-20's). Two hold up a BANNER, which reads: 'B.A.D.S.: Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. 

Among these six are:   

MOSES. African-American. Tall and lean. A gold cross necklace around his neck. The loudest by far - clearly wants to make a statement. A leadership quality to him.   

TYE LOUIN. Mixed-race. Handsome. Thin. One of the two holding the banner. Distinctive of his neck-length dreadlocks.   

NADI HASSAN. A pleasant looking, beautiful young woman. Short-statured and model thin. She takes part in the chanting alongside the others - when:   

RING RING RING.  

Nadi receives a PHONE CALL. Takes out her iPhone and pulls down her mask. Answers:  

NADI: (on phone) (raises voice) HELLO?   

She struggles to hear the other end.   

NADI (CONT'D): (London accent) Henry? Is that you?  

The girl next to her inquires in: CHANTAL CLEMMONS. Long hair. Well dressed.   

CHANTAL: Have you told him?   

Nadi shakes a glimpsing 'No'. Tye looks back to them - eavesdrops.   

NADI: (loudly) Henry, I can't hear you. I'm at a rally - you'll have to shout...   

INTERCUT WITH:  

**INT. HENRY'S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - NIGHT - SAME TIME**    

HENRY: (on phone) ...I said, I was at the BLM rally in the park today. You know, the one I was talking to you about?   

HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20's. Caucasian. Brown hair. Not exactly tall or muscular, yet possesses that unintentional bad boy persona girls weaken for - to accompany his deep BLUE EYES. In the kitchen of a SMALL NORTH-LONDON FLAT, he glows on the other end.  

BACK TO:   

Nadi. The noise around takes up the scene.   

NADI: (on phone) Henry, seriously - I can't hear a single word you're saying. Look, how about we chat tomorrow, yeah? Henry?   

HENRY: (on phone) ...Yeah. Alright - what time do you want me to call-  

NADI: (hangs up) -Ok. Got to go! 

HENRY: (on phone) Yeah - bye! Love y-  

Henry looks to his phone. Lets out a sigh of defeat - before carelessly dumps the phone on the table. Slumps down into a chair.   

HENRY (CONT'D): (to himself) ...Fuck.   

Henry looks over at the chair opposite him. A RALLY SIGN lies against it. The sign reads:   

'LOVE HAS NO COLOUR' 

**INT. BOSTON CAFE - LATER THAT DAY**    

At a table, the exhausted B.A.D.S. sit in a HALF-EMPTY CAFE (people still protest outside). An awkwardness hangs over them. The TV above the counter displays the NEWS.   

NEWS WOMAN: ...I know the main debates of this time are equal rights and, of course, the pandemic - but we cannot hide from the facts: global warming is at an all-time high! Even with the huge decrease in air travel and manufacture of certain automobiles, one thing that has not decreased is deforestation...   

MOSES: (to B.A.D.S.) That's it... That's all we can do... for now.   

A WAITRESS comes over...   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to waitress) Uhm... Yeah - six coffees... (before she goes) But, I have mine black. Thanks.   

The waitress walks away. Moses checks her out before turns back to the group.  

MOSES (CONT'D): At least NOW... we can focus on what really matters. On how we're truly gonna make a difference in this world...   

No reply. Everyone looks down as to avoid Moses' eyes.   

MOSES (CONT'D): How we all feel 'bout that?   

The members look to each other - wonder who will go first...  

CHANTAL: (to Moses) I dunno... It's just feeling... real all'er sudden. (to group) Right?   

MOSES: (ignores Chantal) How the rest of y'all feeling?   

JEROME: Shit - I'm going. Fuck this world.   

JEROME BOOTH. Sat next to Moses - basically his lapdog.   

BETH: Yeah. Me too...   

And BETH GODWIN. Shaved head. Athlete's body.   

BETH (CONT'D): (coldly) Even though y'all won’t let my girl come.   

MOSES: Nadi, you're being a quiet duck... What you gotta say 'bout all'er this?  

Nadi. Put on the spot. Everyone's attention on her.   

NADI: Well... It just feels like we're giving up... I mean, people are here fighting for their civil and human rights, whereas we'll be somewhere far away from all this - without making a real contribution...   

Moses gives her a stone-like reaction.  

NADI (CONT'D): (off Moses' look) It just seems to me we should still be fighting - rather than... running away.   

Awkward silence. Everyone back on Moses.   

MOSES: You think this is us running away?... (to others) Is that what the rest of y'all think? That this is ME, retreating from the cause?   

Moses cranes back at Nadi for an answer. She looks back without one.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Nadi. You like your books... Ever read 'Sun Tzu: the Art of War'?   

Nadi's eyes meet the others: 'What's he getting at?' 

NADI: ...No-  

MOSES: -It was Sun Tzu that said: 'Build your opponent a golden bridge for which they will retreat across'... Well, we're gonna build our own damn bridge - and while this side falls into political, racial and religious chaos... we'll be on the other side - creating a black utopia in the land of our ancestors, where humanity began and can begin again...   

Everyone's clearly heard this speech before.   

MOSES (CONT'D): But, hey! If y'all think that's a retreat - hey... y'all are entitled to your opinions... Free speech and all that, right? Ain't that what makes America great? Civilization great? Democracy?... (shakes 'no') Nah. That's an illusion... Not on our side though. On our side, in our utopia... that will be a REALITY.   

Another awkward silence.   

JEROME: Retreat is sometimes... just advancing in a different direction... Right?   

MOSES: (to Jerome) Right! (to others) Right! Exactly!   

The B.A.D.S. look back to each other. Moses' speech puts confidence back in them.   

MOSES (CONT'D): Well... What y'all say? Can I count on my people?   

Nadi, Chantal and Tye: sat together. Nod a hesitant 'Yes'.   

TYE: Yeah, man... No sweat.   

Moses opens his hands, gestures: 'Is this over?' 

MOSES: Good... Good. Glad we're sticking to the original plan.   

The waitress brings over the six coffees.   

MOSES (CONT'D): (to group) I gotta leak.   

JEROME: Yeah, me too.   

Moses leaves for the restroom. Jerome follows.   

CHANTAL: (to Beth) Seriously Beth? We're all leaving our loved ones behind and all you care about is if you can still get laid?  

BETH: Oh, that's big talk coming from you!   

Chantal and Beth get into it from across the table - as:   

TYE: (to Nadi) Hey... Have you told him yet?   

Nadi searches to see if the other two heard - too busy arguing.   

NADI: No, but... I've decided I'm going do it tomorrow. That way I have the night to think about what I'm going to say...   

TYE: (supportive) Yeah. No sweat...   

Tye locks eyes with Nadi.   

TYE (CONT'D): But... it's about time, right?   

Underneath the table, Tye puts a hand on Nadi's lap.    

**EXT. NORTH LONDON - STREET - EARLY MORNING**   

A chilly day on a crammed SHOPPING STREET.   

Henry crosses the road. He removes his headphones, stops and stares ahead:   

A large line has formed outside a Jobcentre - bulked with masked people. Henry lets out a depressing sigh. Pulls out a mask before joins the line.  

Now in line. Henry looks around at passing, covered up faces. Embarrassed.   

Then:   

PING.  

Henry receives a TEXT. Opens it...   

It's from Nadi. TEXT reads:   

'Hey Henry xx Sorry couldn't talk yesterday, but urgently need to talk to U today. When's best for U??'   

Henry pulls down his mask to type. Excitement glows on his face as he clicks away.   

**INT. HENRY’S FLAT - NORTH LONDON - LATER**   

\[Hey, it’s the OP here. Miss me?... Yeah, thought so. 

This is the first of four scenes I’ll be omitting in this post – but don’t worry, I’m going to give you a brief summary of the scenes instead.  

In this first scene, Henry goes back to his flat to videochat with Nadi. Once they first try to make some rather awkward small talk, Nadi then tells Henry of her friends’ plan to start a commune in the rainforest. As you can imagine, Henry is both confused and rather pissed off by this news. After arguing about this for a couple of pages too long, Henry then asks what this means for their relationship – and although Nadi doesn’t say it out loud, her silence basically confirms she’s breaking up with him. 

Well, now that’s out of the way, let’s continue to the next scene\] 

**INT. RESTURAUNT/PUB - LONDON - NIGHT**   

\[Yep - still here. 

I’m afraid this is another scene with some badly written dialogue. I promise this won’t be a recurring theme throughout the script, so you can spare me your complaints in the comments. Once we get to the adventure stuff, the dialogue’s pretty much ok from there on.  

So, in this scene, we find Henry in a pub-restaurant sat amongst his older sister, Ellie, her douche of a boyfriend, and his even douchier mates. Henry is clearly piss-drunk in this scene, and Ellie tries prying as to why he’s drinking his sorrows away. Ellie’s boyfriend and his mates then piss Henry off, causing him to drunkenly storm out the pub. 

The scene then transitions to Ellie driving Henry’s drunken ass home, all the while he complains about Nadi and her “woke” American activist friends. Trying desperately to change the subject, Ellie then mentions that she and her douche of a boyfriend got a DNA test done online. I know this sounds like very random dialogue to include, and it definitely reads this way, but what Ellie says here is actually pretty important to the story – or what we screenwriters call a “plot point.”  

Well, what Ellie reveals to Henry, is that when her DNA results came back, her ancestry was said to be 6% French and 6% Congolese (yeah, as in the place Nadi and her friends are going to). This revelation seems to spark something in Henry, causing him to get out of Ellie’s car and take the London Underground home\] 

**INT. NADI’S APARTMENT - BOSTON - NIGHT**    

\[Ok. I know you’re all getting sick of me excluding pieces of the story by now. But rest assured, this is the last time I’m going to do this for the remainder of the series. OP’s promise. 

In this final omitted scene, we find Nadi fast asleep in her bedroom. Her phone then rings where she wakes to Henry calling her. We also read here that Tye is asleep next to Nadi (what a two-timer, am I right?) Moving to the living room to talk with Henry over the phone, Henry then asks Nadi if he can accompany the B.A.D.S. to the Congo. When Nadi says no to this due to the trip being for members only, Henry tells her about Ellie’s DNA results (you know, the 6% Congolese thing?) Henry basically tells Nadi this to suggest he should go with her to the Congo because he’s also technically of African heritage. Although she’s amazed by this, Nadi still isn’t sure whether Henry can come with them. But then Henry asks Nadi something to make his proposal far simpler... Does she still love him? The scene then transitions before Nadi can answer. 

Well, thank God that’s over and done with! Now we can carry on through the story with fewer interruptions from yours truly\] 

**INT. ROOM - UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

Inside a narrow, WHITE ROOM, a long table stretches from door to end. All the B.A.D.S. members (except Nadi) are here - talking amongst themselves. Moses stands by a whiteboard with a black marker in hand, anxious to start.  

MOSES: (interrupts) A’right. Let's get started. We gotta lot to cover...  

CHANTAL: Mo'. Nadi ain't here.  

MOSES: Well, we gonna have to start withou- 

The door opens on the far end: it's Nadi. Rather embarrassed - scurries down to the group. 

NADI: Sorry, I'm late.  

She sits. Tye saving her a seat between him and Chantal.  

MOSES: Right. That's everyone? A'right, so - I just wanted to go over this... (to whiteboard) (remembers) Oh - we're all signed up with that African missionary programme, right? Else how we all gonna get in? 

Everyone nods.  

BETH: Yeah. We signed up.  

MOSES (CONT'D): And we're all scheduled for our vaccinations? Cholera? Yellow fever? Typhoid? 

Again, all nod.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (at whiteboard) A'right. So, I just wanted to make this a little more clear for y'all...  

Moses draws a long 'S' SHAPE on the whiteboard, copies from iPhone.  

MOSES (CONT'D): THIS: is the Congo River... And THIS... (points) This is Kinshasa. Congo Capital City. We'll be landing here...  

Marks KINSHASA on 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): From the airport we'll get a cab ride to the river - meeting the guy with the boat. The guy'll journey us up river, taking no more than a few days, before stopping temporarily in Mbandaka...  

Marks 'MBANDAKA'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): We'll get food, supplies - before continuing a few more days up river. Getting off...  

Draws smaller 's' on top the bigger 'S'.  

MOSES (CONT'D): HERE: at the Mongala River. We'll then meet up with another guy. He'll guide us on foot through the interior. It'll take a day or two more to get to the point in the rainforest we'll call home. But once we're there - it's ours. It'll be our utopia. The journey will be long, but y'all need to remember: the only impossible journey is the one you don't even start... (pause) Any questions? 

JEROME: (hand up) Yeah... You sure we can trust these guys? I mean, this is Africa, right?  

MOSES: Nah, it's cool, man. I checked them out. They seem pretty clean to me.  

Chantal raises her hand.  

MOSES: Yeah?  

CHANTAL: What about rebels? I was just checking online, and... (on iPhone) It says there's fighting happening all around the rivers...  

MOSES: (to group) Guys, relax. I checked out everything. Our route should be perfectly safe. Most of the rebels are in the east of the country - but if we do run into trouble, our boat guy knows how to go undetected... Anyone else?  

Everyone's quiet. Then: 

Nadi. Her hand raised.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (sighs) Yeah?  

NADI: Yes. Thanks. Uhm... This is not really... related to the topic, but... I was just wandering if... maybe...  

Nadi takes a breath. Just going to come out and say it.  

NADI (CONT'D): If maybe Henry could come with us? 

 Silence returns. Everyone looks awkwardly at each other: 'WHAT?' Tye, the most in shock.  

MOSES: Henry?  

NADI: My boyfriend... in the UK.  

MOSES: What? The white guy?  

NADI: My British boyfriend in the UK - yes.  

Moses pauses at this.  

MOSES: So, let me get this straight... You're asking if your WHITE, British boyfriend, can come on an ALL BLACK voyage into Africa?  

Moses is confused - yet finds amusement in this.  

MOSES (CONT'D): What, is that a joke?  

NADI: No. It's just that we were talking a couple of days ago and... I happened to mention to him where we were going- 

MOSES: -Wait, what?? 

TYE: You did what??  

NADI: ...It just came up. 

JEROME: (to Moses) But, I thought this was all supposed to be a secret? That we weren't gonna tell nobody?  

NADI: (defensive) I had to tell him where we were going! He deserved an explanation... 

MOSES: So, Naadia. Let me get this straight... Not only did you expose our plans to an outsider of the group... but, you're now asking for this certain individual: a CAUCASIAN, to come with us? On a voyage, SPECIFICALLY designed for African-Americans, to travel back to the homeland of their ancestors - stolen away in chains by the ancestors of this same individual? Is that really what you're asking me right now?  

NADI: Since when was this trip only for African-Americans? Am I American?  

MOSES: Nadi. Save your breath. Answer's 'No'.  

NADI: But, he's- 

MOSES: -But, he's WHITE. A'right? What, you think he's the only cracker who wanted in on this? I turned down three non-black B.A.D.S. asking to come. So, why should I make an exception for your boyfriend who ain't even a member? (to group) Has anyone here ever even met this guy?  

CHANTAL: I met him... kinda.  

NADI: (sickened) ...I can't believe this. I thought this trip was so we can avoid discrimination - not embrace it.  

MOSES: Look, Nadi. Before you start ranting on about- 

TYE: (to Nadi) -It's best if it's just- 

NADI: -Everyone SHUT UP!  

Nadi shrugs off Tye as him and Moses fall silent. She's clearly had this effect before.  

NADI (CONT'D): Moses. I need you to just listen to me for a moment. Ok? Your voice does not always need to be heard...  

Chantal puts a hand to her own mouth: 'OH NO, SHE DIDN'T!' 

NADI (CONT'D): This group stands for 'The Blood-hood of African Descendants and Sympathizers'. Everyone here going is a descendent - including me... When Henry asked me if he could come with us, I initially said 'No' because he wasn't one of us... But then he tells me his sister had a DNA test - and as it happens... Henry and his sister are both six percent Congolese. Which means HE is a descendent... like everyone here.  

MOSES: Wait, what?? 

CHANTAL: Seriously?  

TYE: Are you kidding me??  

NADI: (ignores Tye) Look! I have proof - here!  

Nadi gives Moses her phone, displays ELLIE'S RESULTS. Moses stares at it - worrisomely.  

MOSES: (unconvinced) A'right. Show me this cracker. 

Nadi looks blankly at him.  

MOSES (CONT'D): A picture - show me!  

Nadi gets up a selfie of her and Henry together. ZOOMS in on Henry.  

Moses smiles. He takes the phone from Nadi to show Jerome and Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): I guess this brother's in the sunken place...  

Moses and Jerome laugh - as does Tye.  

MOSES (CONT'D): (to Nadi) You're telling me this guy: is six percent African? No dark skin? No dark hair? No... big dick or nothing?  

NADI: If having a big dick qualifies someone on going, then nobody in this room would be.  

BETH: OH DAMN! 

JEROME: Hey! Hey!  

TYE: (over noise) He still ain't a member!  

Tye's outburst silences the room.  

TYE (CONT'D): It's members only... (to Moses) Right Mo'?  

MOSES: Right! Members only. Don't matter if he's African or not.  

NADI: He can BECOME a member! 'African Descendants and Sympathizers' - he's both! I mean, the amount of times he's defended me - and all because some racist idiot chose to make a remark about the colour of my skin... And if you are this petty to not let him come, then... you can count me out as well.  

MOSES: What?-  

TYRONE: -What??  

Tye's turned his body fully towards Nadi.  

CHANTAL: Well, I ain't going if Nadi's not going.  

BETH: Great. So, I'm the only girl now? 

MOSES: What d'you care?! You threatened out when I said no to you too!...  

The whole room erupts into argument – all while Tye stares daggers into Nadi. She ignores him. 

**INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**  

Nadi leaves the room as the door shuts behind. She walks off, as a grin slowly dimples her face. She struts triumphantly!  

TYE: Nadi! Nadi, wait!  

Tye throws the door open to come storming after her. Nadi stops reluctantly.  

TYE (CONT'D): I told you, you were the only reason I was going...  

Nadi allows them to hold eye contact. Sympathetic for a moment... 

NADI: Then you were going for the wrong reasons.  

With that, Nadi turns away. Leaves Tye to watch her go.  

**INT. AIRPLANE - IN AIR - NIGHT**  

Now on a FLIGHT to KINSHASA, DR CONGO. Henry is deep in sleep.  

INTERCUT WITH:  

A JUNGLE: like we saw before. Thick green trees - and a LARGE BUSH. No sound.  

BACK TO:  

Henry. Still asleep. Eyes scrunch up - like he's having a bad dream. Then:  

JUNGLE: the bush now enclosed by a LONG, SPARPLY SPIKED FENCE. Defends EMERALD DARKNESS on other side. We hear a wailing... Slowly gets louder. Before:  

Henry wakes! Gasps! Drenched in sweat. Looks around to see passengers sleeping peacefully. Regains himself.  

Henry now removes his seatbelt and moves to the back of plane.  

**INT. AIRPLANE RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS.**  

Henry shuts the door. Sound outside disappears. Takes off his mask and looks in the mirror - breathes heavily as he searches his own eyes.  

HENRY: (to himself) Why are you doing this? Why is she this important to you? 

Henry crouches over the sink. Splashes water on his sweat-drenched face.  

His breathing calms down. Tap still runs, as Henry looks up again...  

HENRY (CONT'D): (to reflection) ...This is insane.  

FADE OUT. 

\[Well, there we have it. Our characters have been introduced and the call to adventure answered... Man, that Moses guy is kind of a douche, isn’t he?  

Once again, I’m sorry about all the omitted scenes, but that dialogue really was badly written. The only regret I have with excluding those scenes was we didn’t get a proper introduction to Henry – he is our protagonist after all. Rest assured, you’ll see plenty of him in Part Three. 

Next week, we officially begin our journey up the Congo River and into the mysterious depths of the Rainforest... where the real horror finally begins. 

Before we end things this week, there are some things I need to clarify... The whole Henry is 6% Congolese plot point?... Yeah, that was completely made up for the screenplay. Something else which was also made up, was that Henry asked Nadi if he could accompany the B.A.D.S. on their expedition. In reality, Henry didn’t ask Nadi if he could come along... Nadi asked him. Apparently, the reason Henry was invited on the trip (rather than weaselling his way into it) was because the group didn’t have enough members willing to join their commune – and so, they had to make do with Henry.  

When I asked the writer why he changed this, the reason he gave was simply because he felt Henry’s call to adventure had to be a lot more interesting... That’s the real difference between storytelling and real life right there... Storytelling forces things to happen, whereas in real life... things just happen. 

Well, that’s everything for this week, folks. Join me again next time, where our journey into the “Heart of Darkness” will finally commence... 

Thanks for tuning in everyone, and until next time, this is the OP,
