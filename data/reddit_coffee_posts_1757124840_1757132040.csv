1n9q1eq,https://v.redd.it/7qi98gtkygnf1,Intermittent electric dash issues (goes haywire) 2018 3500 Laramie,"2018 3500 Laramie (new to us, purchased 2 weeks ago from dealer) 

Video of issue and photos (in comment below) of the two lights that stay on after haywire issues cease and photos of the 3 codes from our reader. The issue started happening when we were on a trip this weekend, got to the point where we couldn‚Äôt even turn it back on after a stop at a coffee shop. We got it started, drove it to the Walmart next door, turned it off and couldn‚Äôt get it started again. Had two Ram owners try to jump both batteries and that didn‚Äôt fix it. Closed the hood and suddenly it recognized our key and started up (dash was still going haywire). We drove it down to a nearby Firestone and the TL:DR was one bad battery, which they replaced. Had no issues on the 5 hour drive home. That was Monday. Just took it on an errand in to town today (haven‚Äôt driven it since Monday) and 5 minutes from home hit some bumps and dash went haywire again. Any clue and anything we can check at home? We already have an appt for Monday to have a Banks air intake and B&W hitch installed. ",2,1757131804.0,ram_trucks,4,1.0,False

I was the type to hit snooze three times and roll out of bed late, already feeling like I was chasing the day.

 That first week was rough ... I was tired, cranky, and ready to quit.

But something shifted after those first few days. I started to really enjoy the quiet mornings... Having a couple of hours just for myself, with no distractions, gave me a sense of peace I hadn‚Äôt felt before...

 Sometimes I worked out, sometimes I read, sometimes I just sipped my coffee in silence. What started as a challenge to wake up earlier turned into a whole mindset shift.

I realized it wasn‚Äôt about ‚Äúhaving more hours‚Äù in the day, but about keeping a promise to myself.

 That discipline bled into other parts of my life ... I ate better, worked with more focus, and most importantly, felt more in control of myself.

The biggest lesson, though, was that waking up early only works if you respect your sleep...

 I had to force myself to go to bed earlier and protect my rest as part of the habit. 

That was the real game changer !

I‚Äôm not saying everyone needs to wake up at 5AM, but I do think pushing yourself into an uncomfortable challenge and sticking with it changes the way you see yourself...

And that confidence is what really makes the difference. :""D",3,1757131414.0,Discipline,0,1.0,False
1n9pwuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1n9pwuw/my_revenge_starts_at_their_altar_the_kidnappers/,My Revenge Starts at Their Altar | The kidnappers had strung us up‚Äîme,"The kidnappers had strung us up‚Äîme and my husband's precious Carol Wilson‚Äîon two separate trees at the edge of a steep cliff. I was six months pregnant, every muscle aching, every moment pure agony. Hanging there, helpless, I begged Bruce with what little voice I had left.  
  
""Bruce, please‚Ä¶ the baby. If I fall, I'll lose them. Carol set this up‚ÄîI heard her talking with them in the car. If you choose me, she'll be fine. Just save our child, please.""  
  
But Bruce just looked at me like I was something dirty, something pathetic.  
  
""I can't believe how low you'll sink, Flora. Trying to pin this on Carol? Even if we lose the baby, we can try again. But Carol saved my life‚ÄîI owe her. I choose Carol.""  
  
My heart stopped. I thought‚Ä¶ I thought he'd at least want to save his own child.  
  
But he didn't.  
  
The rope gave way.  
  
I fell.  
  
The impact shattered me‚Äîbones broke, organs ruptured, blood pooled beneath me. They found me three days later. I lived. The baby didn't.  
  
I was lying in a hospital bed, hollow and broken, crying silent tears for the child I'd never hold, when Bruce stormed in.  
  
He didn't ask how I was. He didn't look at my bandages or my IV. He slapped me‚Äîhard.  
  
""Carol told me everything,"" he snarled. ""You set her up. You had this whole thing planned, and you still had the nerve to blame her? You got what you deserved.""  
  
The slap tore through me‚Äîripping wounds open, shaking my whole body. I stared up at him, blood in my mouth, disbelief turning to rage.  
  
""Are you insane? If I hired them, why would I end up half-dead at the bottom of a cliff?!""  
  
He just smirked. ""Who knows? Maybe you overplayed your hand. You always were dramatic. But Carol's innocent. I've told you‚Äîshe's like a sister to me. And you‚Ä¶ you killed our baby with your jealousy.""  
  
I actually laughed. A raw, broken sound. He brought Carol into our home. He picked her over me‚Äîover his own child. And he had the nerve to call me jealous?  
  
Tears ran down my face, but my voice was steady when I finally spoke.  
  
""I want a divorce. Since Carol means more to you than your wife and child ever did, I'm setting you free.""  
  
His face darkened. ""Stop with the theatrics, Flora. This is your fault. You've changed‚Äîyou used to be gentle. Now you're just a shrew.""  
  
I almost couldn't breathe. Our baby was gone, and he thought I was throwing a tantrum.  
  
""Get some rest,"" he said coldly. ""I'll come back when you've calmed down.""  
  
And he walked out. Just like that.  
  
I watched him go, and all I could do was laugh bitterly at myself. Ten years. Ten years, and it took a cliff, a coffin, and a slap to finally see the man I married.  
  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
When I first met Bruce, his company had just gone under. His ex-girlfriend got cold feet, worried she'd get dragged down with him, so she took off and left the country.  
  
I stood by Bruce through it all‚Äîcheering him on, helping him pitch investors, even convincing my younger brother Dylan, a finance whiz from a top-tier university, to join the team and help turn things around.  
  
Slowly but surely, Bruce's business bounced back. We pulled through the worst of it together.  
  
Eventually, he confessed his feelings and spent six whole months wooing me before we made it official.  
  
Bruce was sweet and attentive‚Äîthe kind of guy who noticed the little things. I really thought we'd spend the rest of our lives together.  
  
Then out of nowhere, he brought Carol home. He said she was the one who saved him years ago.  
  
To pay her back, he covered her college tuition and invited her to live with us.  
  
Carol seemed gentle and soft-spoken on the surface, but underneath, she was cunning and manipulative.  
  
While she played the innocent victim, she was secretly driving a wedge between me and Bruce‚Äîflirting with him under the guise of being his ""little sister,"" and setting me up to look like the jealous wife.  
  
Every time I tried to talk to Bruce about it, he'd take her side. ""Flora, can you stop overreacting? I'm just returning a favor.""  
  
""She's an orphan with nowhere else to go. Can't you try to be a little more compassionate?""  
  
But Carol wasn't just playing games‚Äîshe staged her own kidnapping to frame me, hoping to get rid of me and my unborn child for good.  
  
I'll never forget watching Bruce choose her over us‚Äîleaving me and our baby to fall from that cliff.  
  
If a forest ranger hadn't found me and called for help, I would've died that day.  
  
But Carol twisted the story, making it look like I was behind the kidnapping. Bruce was furious‚Äîhe stormed into my hospital room demanding answers.  
  
But it didn't matter anymore. I'd lost our child, and I'd lost all hope in Bruce.  
  
I made up my mind: I was going to divorce him.  
  
During the five months I spent recovering, Bruce barely visited. And whenever he did, Carol would call within minutes with some excuse to pull him away.  
  
The day I was discharged, I got a call from my flower shop assistant. A woman had just shown up with a bunch of people and trashed the whole place.  
  
When I arrived, the shop was destroyed‚Äîshattered vases, trampled flowers, dirt everywhere.  
  
And there was Carol, sitting on the sofa sipping coffee and smirking like she'd just won the lottery.  
  
She took my child. Now she was destroying the business I'd poured my heart into for years.  
  
Rage took over. I lunged at her, eyes burning, ready to strike‚Äîbut a hand shot out and grabbed my wrist.  
  
Bruce.  
  
Carol crumpled into his arms, sobbing. ""Bruce, I was so scared‚Ä¶""  
  
He held her close, stroking her hair. ""It's okay. I'm here. No one's going to hurt you.""  
  
Then he turned to me, his expression turning cold. ""I told her to do it. After what you did‚Äîarranging that kidnapping‚ÄîCarol's been diagnosed with mild depression. She needed to let it out.""  
  
""Destroying your shop was the least you deserved.""  
  
I almost laughed. It took me five years to build that business from the ground up. And he called this ""deserved""?  
  
""This is my shop,"" I said, voice icy. ""Not yours. What gives you the right to let her destroy it?""  
  
""I'll pay for the damages. But if you ever try to lay a hand on Carol again, you'll regret it.""  
  
He shoved my hand away so hard I stumbled and fell. Shards of a broken pot dug into my skin. I gasped in pain.  
  
""If you love her that much,"" I said through gritted teeth, ""why won't you agree to a divorce?""  
  
At the word ""divorce,"" Carol's eyes lit up. No doubt she'd been waiting for this.  
  
Bruce's face darkened. ""Enough. I don't want to hear that word again. We've been through too much these past ten years. How can you give up so easily? You disappoint me.""  
  
He said I disappointed him.  
  
But he was the one who chose another woman over me. He stood by while I lost our child. And now he refused to let me go‚Äîdid he want to keep us both?  
  
Fine. If he wouldn't agree to divorce, I'd force his hand.  
  
I pushed myself up, grabbed a flowerpot, and swung it straight at Carol's head.  
  
Bruce blocked it with his arm. The pot shattered against him.  
  
His eyes turned dangerous. ""I've been too easy on you. That's why you've become this cruel.""  
  
""First you set up that kidnapping, and I let it slide because I knew you were grieving. But now you're attacking her in broad daylight? This ends now.""  
  
""You will apologize to Carol. Or I will make your life hell.""  
  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
True to his word, Bruce moved quickly‚Äîand ruthlessly.  
  
My younger brother Dylan, who had poured his heart into the company and had just been promoted to vice president, was suddenly fired without cause.  
  
Even with his Ivy League degree and impressive resume, Dylan couldn't catch a break. Everywhere he applied, doors slammed in his face.  
  
Then things got worse. Thugs started showing up at my parents' small restaurant, harassing customers and stirring up trouble. When my dad confronted them, they beat him up so badly he ended up in the hospital.  
  
Bruce didn't stop there‚Äîhe went after my relatives, too, even the ones running a humble fruit stand. He had people sabotage their business, day after day. This was how Bruce played: he targeted everyone I loved to force me to my knees.  
  
I could handle his games if it was just me. But my family? That was a line he shouldn't have crossed.  
  
Dylan tried to play it cool. ""Don't worry about me, Flora. Maybe I needed a vacation anyway."" My parents said the same‚Äîthey'd rather shut down the restaurant than see me surrender.  
  
But I knew better. They were just trying to protect me. I couldn't let them pay the price for my pride.  
  
So I swallowed mine and went to Bruce.  
  
He was in his element, calmly cutting into a steak like a king holding court. I forced the words out: ""Bruce, I was wrong. I never should've treated Carol that way. Please‚Ä¶ leave my family alone.""  
  
He didn't even look up. ""I told you. Apologize to Carol in person. Then‚Äîand only then‚Äîwill this stop.""  
  
Clenching my jaw, I went to Carol‚Äîthe woman I despised most in this world. ""I'm sorry, Carol,"" I choked out. ""It was my fault.""  
  
She put on that sweet, fake smile and reached for my hands. ""Oh, Flora, it was all a misunderstanding. Let's put it behind us, okay?"" I fought back nausea and let her hold my hands.  
  
I knew better than to fight them directly. So I played along. I smiled when I wanted to scream. I stayed calm when I wanted to break something. I never took the bait.  
  
Carol grew impatient. She wanted me out of the picture‚Äîso she could have Bruce and his name all to herself.  
  
When she realized I wasn't going to give her the dramatic reaction she wanted, she took a dangerous gamble.  
  
She leaked intimate photos of her and Bruce to the media, fueling a very public scandal. The internet exploded. People called her a homewrecker and pitied me.  
  
But Bruce thought I was behind it‚Äîthat I was trying to ruin Carol's reputation.  
  
He was furious. He accused me, divorced me on the spot, and immediately got engaged to Carol‚Äîall to ""protect"" her.  
  
At their engagement party, reporters swarmed. When asked how they met, Bruce told a story straight out of a fairy tale.  
  
He held up an old scarf, stained with dried blood. He recounted how, as a boy, he'd been kidnapped. A brave young girl had called the police and saved him. His arm was injured; she'd used this scarf to bandage it. But before he could thank her, her parents whisked her away.  
  
""I promised myself,"" Bruce said, ""that if I ever found that girl, I'd spend the rest of my life making it up to her."" Then he turned to Carol. ""That girl was her.""  
  
The crowd sighed. How romantic. How destined.  
  
But Carol looked pale. Uncomfortable. Almost scared.  
  
Watching the livestream at home, I knew why.  
  
She was afraid the real girl would see this and expose her.  
  
Because that girl wasn't Carol.  
  
It was me.  
  
Carol had stolen my story, killed my baby, and now she was stealing my husband.  
  
But she wouldn't get away with it.  
  
I had a plan.  
  
On the day of their wedding, I showed up wearing a mask.  
  
It was time for revenge.

1n9punf,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1n9punf/crash_musings/,Crash musings...,"Hello, everyone. I hope you're all at or near your baselines.

Just last night I spoke to a friend. I'm at a place in my life where all my friends have teenage kids, so they're too busy for casual phone calls. The guy I spoke to last night spoke to me in two 20-minute intervals as he drove to and from Shopper's Drug Mart.

It felt so good. I was actually tingling after I hung up the phone. I laid in bed enjoying the feeling of having spoken to an old friend. We talked about his kids, then tv shows and movies... I can't watch any of them but we still talked about the actors and stuff.

I had noticed this feeling before after talking to someone or going for coffee with someone but I guess it's been so long this time that the actual personal interaction creating this glowing, warming feeling in me that kept me awake enjoying it for a long time.

And all the normal people get this all the time... it's a part of being human. People in jail talk to friends/have more friends than I do. My life is like being on house arrest except I feel like hammered shit and I can't actually do anything.

When I was lonely before, I'd go to the mall and just walk around. Seeing, hearing, smelling other people... it's part of what makes us human.

There's a line in American Dad, this neighbour that never goes out, he says to someone, ""I haven't spoken out loud in days!"" It's a funny joke but the reality of it is scary and I hope I never get like that.

Sorry to be rambling. It's that time of my day where I have to stay awake long enough to make it to bedtime. I can't read or watch tv so it's so incredibly boring... I suppose being melancholy is better than long covid rage or crying.

The latest thing I've discovered I can do is go into Youtube and read the comments for scenes from the movies I've watched in my past; it's like having a conversation with other movie buffs. I can do this for ten or fifteen minutes every couple of hours.

That's it. Thanks for listening. Back to the Friday night burnout crash. Take care and stay rested, everyone.

I doubt I have fine hair as I did the hair thickness test and i can decently feel a single strand of hair in between my fingers. 

Anyone else have hair that curls or spirals but the hair too close to your head falls flat? (since I essentially have a bob none of my hair will curl up except sometimes the first 2 inches are and then the rest falls flat for reasons).

I noticed I'll find hairs when shampoing that are extremely curly, so i wonder if its just fine hair? (like 3b. sort of tight curles but alot looser than corkscrew).

However it actually puffs up some and takes on some life if i wear a hat, even if the hat wouldve flattened it out, which makes me think that even if it doesnt feel dry its actually really dry(and i wasnt actually overmoisturizing it). The hat coult actually be drying it up since its one of those knit/acrylic hats)

I'll also find others hairs sometimes that are equally curly but my familly's hair is all brushed straight/wavy...so it makes sense that its just not enough moisture. Humidity here is pretty decent too.

Also I'll find really really weak thin hairs that just might be damaged but they're very very tight compared to those other hairs. Always thin though, its weird. Thought i was going grey cause theyre light too.

I guess my hair is just either straight/slightly wavy or really really weak (my diet sucked, i'd eat like only late at night and sometimes skip a meal for coffee, wouldn't be surprised if the reason my hair is glowing out a bit differently at the roots its cause I'm eating/living healthier now.) My hairs aren't really fine, they're a bit thicker and sometimes i find darker hairs(not like thyroid issues symptoms just more akin to one of my parents hair) so I'm wondering if i just have some hairs that are causing it to flatten out

I;m in my 20s so hey partly likely hormones.

My research began innocently enough; a longitudinal study on childhood imagination and social development, funded by the university's psychology department. I interviewed parents, collected surveys, and asked children to draw pictures of their imaginary friends. Standard developmental psychology, the kind of research that fills academic journals and occasionally makes feel-good news segments.

After eighteen months, I had documentation on 247 imaginary friends from children across six states. The data revealed normal patterns: invisible companions who provided comfort during difficult transitions, elaborate fantasy worlds that reflected children's emotional needs, temporary friends who disappeared as kids developed real social connections.

But that‚Äôs not to say there weren‚Äôt anomalies. Anomalies that made me question this entire study.

Part of the study was for the children to draw their imaginary friend. Of course, we cant see them since they are imaginary, so this serves to help me understand what they see. What they imagine. And gives me insight into the psychological workings of their minds. You really can tell a lot about how a kid is feeling and is raised based on how they perceive their imaginary companions.

As I was going over my documents late one night at my desk with a cup of coffee that had far too much sugar in it and my phone on do not disturb so no one interrupts my thought process, I read through the most recent reports and skimmed over the images that were sent to me. Most of the drawings were in crude stick figures with crayons. Some were more elegant than others, using colored pencils and fine lines in their drawings. Of course not all kids are going to be the next Picasso, but there is still something pleasant about seeing the occasionally well-drawn image from a child every now and then.

Most however, as I said before, used stick figures and improper proportions that I typically dismissed as lack of artistic experience with the human form. A few had very strange characteristics that I chalked up to childish whimsy and imagination. Some had tails. Some were part reptile or part bird. Some had heads that were way too big for their bodies. Those ones always made me chuckle. Some had little top hats or had rainbow-colored teeth and hair. And some even looked like their parents in a way. There was one that made me uncomfortable to look at though. Almost as if the woman in the image was trying too hard to seem like a friend, and that just made her seem even more unfriendly to me.

But as I keep reviewing the drawings, that‚Äôs when I noticed it. A familiar face. A reappearing body shape. A repeating design. A recurring uncanny smile. At first I thought it was a coincidence, that a child submitted 2 drawings on accident of their imaginary friend and brushed it off; but I found another. And another. And another. There were 11 drawings in total.

Eleven children, from completely different families in different cities, had drawn remarkably similar figures. Same elongated limbs, same dark hollow eyes, same unsettling smile that was too wide for the face. The smile that wanted so badly to convince you the being its attached to is harmless, but sets off all of your ‚Äúdo not engage‚Äù alarms when you stare too long at it. The children had never met, attended different schools, lived hundreds of miles apart. Yet they all drew the same imaginary friend. The one I couldn‚Äôt stand to look at.

But it wasn‚Äôt just the way it looked that was the same. Across all 11 kids, their imaginary friend had the exact same name: Inka.

I initially dismissed it as coincidence. Children's drawings often share common elements, and ""Inka"" could be a popular character from some show I wasn't familiar with. So of course, I looked into all popular kids shows for a trace of this ‚ÄúInka‚Äù. Thinking perhaps she is a main character, or at the very least a fan favorite. But when I researched children's media, I found no character matching the description. In fact, I found no characters who were even named Inka.

As I went over my notes and the notes that others had collected from this study, it soon became clear to me that the children who drew Inka were different from my other subjects. During interviews, they were unusually articulate about their friend's appearance and behavior. They could describe Inka's voice, mannerisms, and preferences with startling detail. Most imaginary friends evolved over time as children's needs changed, but Inka remained remarkably consistent across all reports.

""She tells me things,"" said Marcus, age six, from Portland. ""About people before they happen. Like when Daddy was going to lose his job, or when Grammy got sick.""

""Inka knows everyone,"" stated Sophie, age seven, from Denver. ""She shows me other kids who talk to her too. We're all Inka‚Äôs friends, Dr. Martinez."" I continued reading the remarks that the kids had about this ‚ÄúInka‚Äù, but I couldn't get past what Sophie had said. ‚ÄúInka knows everyone.‚Äù I repeated to myself.

That detail made my skin crawl. Imaginary friends were supposed to be personal, private companions. They didn't connect children to networks of other kids.

I expanded my research, specifically targeting children who claimed to have friends named Inka. The response was overwhelming. Within six months, I'd documented 89 children across twelve states who described identical experiences with the same entity.

Their drawings were disturbingly uniform. Same proportions, same facial features, same unsettling details that seemed beyond typical childhood artistic development. And that same smile that feigns innocence. I should have stopped collecting the drawings when I realized they all depicted the same face, but my academic curiosity overrode my growing unease.

The children described Inka's behavior in eerily similar terms. She appeared during times of stress or isolation. She knew things about the children's lives that they'd never told anyone. She encouraged them to keep secrets from their parents. And most disturbing of all, she talked about ""the others""; other children she visited, creating a sense of belonging to something larger.

""Inka says we're special,"" eight-year-old David from Chicago told me. ""She says normal kids can't see her, but we can because we're going to help her with something important.""

""What kind of help?"" I asked.

David's expression became distant, unfocused. ""She hasn't told us yet. But she says when we're older, we'll understand. We'll all meet each other and do something together.""

I began tracking the children longitudinally, checking in with families every few months. The pattern that emerged was terrifying in its consistency. Children who maintained contact with Inka showed accelerated development in certain areas; pattern recognition, spatial reasoning, mathematical concepts far beyond their grade level. But they also exhibited concerning behaviors: social withdrawal, resistance to authority, and an unusual interest in topics like archaeology, ancient civilizations, and death.

Their parents reported strange incidents. Children waking up with knowledge they shouldn't possess. Complex drawings and writings in symbols that resembled no known language. Conversations overheard where the child seemed to be receiving detailed instructions about subjects completely inappropriate for their age.

The breakthrough came when I analyzed the geographical distribution of Inka sightings. They weren't random. The children lived in locations that, when mapped, formed geometric patterns across the landscape. Perfect triangles, precise circles, arrangements that suggested careful planning rather than coincidental distribution.

Someone, or rather something, was systematically selecting children based on geographic coordinates.

I tried to publish my findings, but academic journals rejected the research as ""methodologically unsound"" and ""lacking scientific rigor."" Colleagues dismissed my work as an elaborate hoax or evidence of researcher bias. Even the university ¬†that gave me this imaginary friend study in the first place, quietly suggested I might benefit from a paid leave of absence for a while.

But the children kept contacting me. Now teenagers, they began reaching out independently, describing shared dreams and synchronized experiences. They spoke of receiving ""assignments"" from Inka, tasks that involved visiting specific locations, collecting particular objects, or performing rituals they didn't understand but felt compelled to complete.

One week ago, I got a phone call late in the afternoon while I was combing through my most recent findings and seeing if there was something that I missed when I heard my ringer go off. I thought I set it to ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù, but answered it anyway so I could tell whoever it was to call back another time.

""Dr. Martinez,"" said seventeen-year-old Sophie who was on the other end of the call. Her voice hollow with exhaustion. ""Inka says it's almost time. She says the preparation phase is ending. All of us are supposed to gather at coordinates she's been teaching us since we were kids.""

""Where?"" I asked, hoping I could piece together whatever the hell was about to go down.

""I can't tell you that. But Dr. Martinez... she knows about your research. She knows you've been studying us. She's not happy about it.""

The line went dead. As upset as I was about that interruption, I thought to myself it‚Äôs my own fault for leaving my ringer on when I know to turn it off when working. I went to switch to Do Not Disturb, only to stare at my phone in confusion as it was already set to that mode long before the call took place.

That night, I dreamed of dark hollow eyes and an impossibly wide smile. I woke to find a drawing on my nightstand, rendered in my own handwriting: the same elongated figure I'd seen in hundreds of children's artwork since I first came across it at my desk over 9 years ago. That smile was unmistakable. I knew what I was looking at before I even read the note that was also in my handwriting. Below the drawing of her, in careful block letters, was a message:

""YOUR STUDY IS COMPLETE. DISCONTINUE RESEARCH. SOON YOU WILL ALL SEE ME LIKE I SEE ALL OF YOU. ¬†‚ÄîINKA""

I've destroyed my files, shredded the drawings, erased all digital records of my research. But it's too late. Somewhere across the country, 89 young adults who've been in contact with the same entity since childhood are converging on coordinates they've memorized since they were six years old.

And I'm the only person who knows they're coming.

The only person who understands that what we called imagination was actually recruitment.

Inka was never imaginary. She was just very, very patient. And soon, we‚Äôll all see what Inka sees.

\-------

  
The idea for this story came from a game my sister and I use to play when we were very young where we would just say the word ‚ÄúInka‚Äù to each other over and over and try to guess what the other was REALLY trying to say. And then a few years later, our younger cousins picked it up and even though my sister hated them for playing the ‚ÄúInka Game‚Äù after all those years, I would egg them on just to screw with her. What‚Äôs funny is that none of us even know where the word Inka came from. It just became this thing we both wanted to do out of nowhere. Strange huh?",2,1757130740.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

How original. And if you asked him anything else, I mean literally anything else, he'd find a way to turn into a sex joke. Your putting cream in your coffee? It's CUM!!! ha!ha!ha! Everybody else was the same too. Just endless childish sex jokes to the point that you couldn't even have a normal conversation. 

I also remember another time when our class was interrupted because one the kids was loudly moaning like he was having an orgasm and the teacher had to come over to him and tell to stop it. She actually said to him that if he keeps on acting like that, he's not going to get any. Which, she was right about that.

On a few occasions getting a take-away coffee, my lower (inner) lips have become a bit swollen. Last time, I freaked out, thinking I was having anaphylaxis, and injected. The ambulance came and ruled that I was stable and okay. Now I can't get it out of my head that I've developed an allergy to milk/dairy. Every time I have it, my mouth feels funny and I feel a bit sick. But I can't tell now if it's just hyper fixation and OCD (which I have). I've tolerated milk all my life. 

I have an allergy to nuts and legumes, as well as a few other things like avocado and sunflower seeds.

Can anyone give me some advice? I'm seeing my allergist next month (10 Oct), but what do I do between now and then? I can't eat without having panic attacks.

1n9pmlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1n9pmlg/baking_a_cake_for_his_mistress/,Baking a Cake for His Mistress,"The elevator plunged from the top floor‚Äîa violent, gut-wrenching drop that felt both endless and terrifyingly fast. The crash was deafening. Metal shrieked against metal, and the floor buckled beneath our feet.  
  
A sharp, searing pain shot through me. Warm blood soaked through my clothes. My mind screamed, not just from the pain, but from the horrifying realization‚Äîthe tiny life inside me was gone.  
  
Paramedics arrived quickly, wrapping me in blood-streaked bandages before lifting my broken body onto a stretcher. That's when I saw him. Nicholas Richmond, my boyfriend, had just returned from a meeting with his secretary, Courtney Miller.  
  
His arm was wrapped protectively around her. He gently shielded her eyes and whispered, ""Don't look. It's too awful."" Without a second glance in my direction, they turned and walked into the building, leaving me behind.  
  
The realization hit like a second fall. Five years together meant nothing. I was never that important to him. Not when Courtney's sweet smile occupied his every thought.  
  
Right then, I made a decision I'd been putting off for weeks. I pulled out my phone and called the rival company that had been trying to recruit me. ""I'm ready to accept your offer.""  
  
Two days later, I was discharged from the hospital. But there was no relief‚Äîonly a hollow ache deeper than any physical wound.  
  
I walked out alone. No longer carrying the life I'd only just discovered was growing inside me. That morning felt like a cruel dream: a positive test, a flutter of hope, then a nightmare‚Äîall before I could even process what was happening.  
  
As I packed my few belongings, I whispered, ""I don't even know how far along I was."" The thought cut deeper than any knife. My baby was too small, too fragile to survive.  
  
Just then, the door creaked open. For one foolish second, I hoped it was Nicholas.  
  
It wasn't.  
  
A driver stood in the doorway. ""Miss McLain, Mr. Richmond had a sudden meeting. He sent me to pick you up."" His voice was polite but detached. ""Let me help with your things.""  
  
I exhaled slowly. Of course. Nicholas always had an excuse‚Äîsomething more important. But for Courtney? He was never too busy.  
  
Two days in the hospital, and he never showed. No call. No visit. Nothing.  
  
""No need. I've got it,"" I said, forcing a smile as I slung my bag over my shoulder and walked out.  
  
The car ride was quiet. City lights blurred past the window, but I couldn't focus. Inside, I felt darker than the night itself. By the time we pulled up to the house, I was completely numb.  
  
""We're here, Miss,"" the driver said softly.  
  
I reached for my handbag, ready to get out, when something caught my eye‚Äîa delicate black lace bra tucked between the seats. It wasn't mine.  
  
My stomach twisted. I discreetly slipped it into my bag before the driver could open my door.  
  
""Thank you,"" I muttered, hurrying inside without looking for Nicholas. I already knew he wouldn't be home. Not yet, anyway.  
  
I took the stairs, avoiding the elevator without a second thought. The memory of that fall still clung to me. Just the idea of being trapped again sent shivers down my spine.  
  
Up in my room, I tossed the bra onto the dresser, trying to ignore the painful questions swirling in my mind. Whose was it? And why was it there?  
  
A hot shower washed away the hospital grime, but it did nothing to cleanse the doubt and betrayal simmering inside. Still, I brushed it off and climbed into bed, hoping sleep would come.  
  
When morning arrived, I woke to the familiar‚Äîyet unsettling‚Äîsight of Nicholas lying beside me. This had become our routine: him slipping into bed after I'd fallen asleep, like we were nothing more than parallel lines. Close, but never touching.  
  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
His eyes fluttered open under my gaze. ""You're awake?"" he asked, his voice thick with sleep.  
  
I didn't answer. Instead, I swung my legs over the side of the bed and sat in silence.  
  
""If you're still not feeling well, you don't have to go into work,"" he offered, sitting up.  
  
""Too much is piling up. I can't afford more time off,"" I replied flatly.  
  
Inside, a plan was forming. I needed to wrap things up at the office so I could hand in my resignation and leave this life behind.  
  
Nicholas nodded, completely oblivious. ""Well, your injuries are just superficial. You'll heal quickly,"" he said before slipping into the bathroom, phone in hand‚Äîlike always.  
  
I watched the door close, disappointment settling deep.  
  
He used to take quick showers. Lately, though, with his phone always in tow, they'd gotten longer. I used to join him, laughing and talking through the steam. But those days were gone.  
  
And honestly? I couldn't bring myself to care anymore. I used a different bathroom, determined to avoid him as long as possible.  
  
By the time I was dressed, Nicholas was already on the sofa, newspaper in hand. He glanced up, sarcasm lacing his tone. ""Skipping our morning coffee ritual? You must be in a rush.""  
  
I ignored the jab. ""It slipped my mind.""  
  
He sighed and set the paper down. ""Fine. Let's get to the office early, then.""  
  
We'd always driven to work together since moving in three years ago. Back then, everything felt aligned‚Äîsame goals, same rhythm. But lately, I'd felt a shift. A quiet, growing distance.  
  
Nicholas seemed more attached to his phone than to me. Even when I pulled away, hoping he'd notice, he acted like nothing had changed. Like my silence meant nothing.  
  
That morning, I sat quietly in the car while Nicholas stared at his phone. Suddenly, he spoke up. ""Let's stop for coffee and breakfast,"" he told the driver, not even looking at me.  
  
""Yes, sir.""  
  
Out of the corner of my eye, I could see him texting Courtney.  
  
\[Nicholas: Left early since Frey has a lot to catch up on after taking yesterday off. No need to rush though.\]  
  
\[Courtney: Understood. Her team's been busy‚Äîshe must feel guilty. You take it easy too, Nick. Light schedule today‚Äîjust proposals and one meeting.\]  
  
\[Nicholas: Good. Can you book the usual for lunch?\]  
  
\[Courtney: Of course! Any cravings?\]  
  
I looked away, stung by their easy back-and-forth. They made plans‚Äîalways plans‚Äîbut never with me. It was like they were the couple, not us.  
  
So what was I, then?  
  
We pulled up to the caf√©. Nicholas rolled down the window and ordered casually: ""One hot Americano, one iced Americano, a caramel Frappuccino, one chocolate croissant, and two peanut butter croissants. That's all.""  
  
At first, I thought he'd ordered extra for the driver. But after collecting the bag, he handed me the iced coffee and a peanut butter croissant.  
  
I froze. Staring at the croissant, my heart sank.  
  
After five years‚Ä¶ he still didn't remember I'm allergic to peanuts?  
  
My eyes drifted to the chocolate croissant and caramel Frappuccino he kept for himself. Was he saving them for Courtney?  
  
The betrayal cut deeper with every careless act.  
  
My voice turned icy as I handed the croissant to the driver. ""Please take this. I'm allergic to peanuts.""  
  
Only then did Nicholas seem to remember. ""Oh, right,"" he said, indifferent. ""I forgot. We can turn back.""  
  
""Don't bother,"" I replied sharply. ""Just head to the office. I'll grab something nearby.""  
  
""Fine."" He shrugged, and silence fell between us.  
  
As the office building came into view, I reached into my bag and pulled out a small paper bag I'd prepared earlier.  
  
I handed it to him casually. ""Almost forgot. I packed this for Courtney.""  
  
His brows furrowed as he took it. Curiosity flickered in his eyes‚Äîuntil he peeked inside. Then his face went pale.  
  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Back then, Nicholas probably never imagined he'd get caught red-handed by me so easily.  
  
Leaving something so personal just lying around in the car‚Ä¶ it spoke volumes. Whatever had happened between them, it was brazen. Shameless.  
  
And what made it worse‚Äîit must've happened just two days ago, while I was lying in a hospital bed, broken and alone.  
  
But the look on his face when I found it? Almost comical. His eyes went wide with disbelief, like a kid caught stealing candy.  
  
Yet, true to form, he quickly slipped back into that cool, unshakable facade. ""She's always so careless,"" he said smoothly, brushing it off like it was nothing.  
  
I didn't answer. Instead, I pushed the car door open and got out‚Äîbreaking another one of our unspoken rules. I always used to wait for him to open my door. Not today.  
  
But my little act of rebellion didn't even make a dent in his armor. Nothing ever did.  
  
""Idiot,"" I muttered under my breath as I joined the elevator line.  
  
Then it hit me‚Äîthe memory of the accident. The blood. The panic. My breath caught in my throat, and suddenly the walls felt like they were closing in.  
  
I squeezed my eyes shut, whispering, ""It's just your imagination, Freida. It's not real. You're okay.""  
  
But when I opened my eyes, I was still shaking. Without another thought, I stepped out of the line and headed for the emergency stairs.  
  
They stretched up endlessly. I sighed, trying to rally some motivation. ""Well,"" I mumbled to myself, ""at least it's exercise.""  
  
By the time I reached the office, my legs were burning. But the quiet was a relief. No one else was in yet, so I sat down and started drafting my resignation letter.  
  
Every word felt like a weight lifting off my shoulders. Years of waiting, hoping, feeling invisible‚Äîfinally pouring out onto the page.  
  
Once it was done, I headed to the break room to make coffee.  
  
Just as I was pouring the hot water, two women walked in, whispering.  
  
""I don't think Mr. Richmond has feelings for Miss McLain anymore,"" one said quietly.  
  
The other nodded. ""Yeah, did you see? When the accident happened, he was busy comforting his secretary. Can you believe it?""  
  
""So it's true then? He's having an affair?""  
  
Their words cut deep, like a knife twisting in my chest. They hadn't noticed me standing there with my back turned‚Äînot until I stirred my coffee and walked past them.  
  
Their faces froze when they saw me. But I kept my expression blank, detached, like I hadn't just heard the last shred of my dignity crumbling away.  
  
The truth was, they weren't wrong. Whatever was left of Nicholas and me was already hollow‚Äîa fragile shell ready to break.  
  
I carried my coffee back to my desk and sat down with a heavy sigh.  
  
I got so lost in work, I didn't realize it was already 5 pm. My colleague Taylor stopped by on her way out. ""Working late again? After two days off?""  
  
I gave a tired smile. ""Just catching up.""  
  
""Don't work yourself to death,"" she said with a shrug. ""See you tomorrow.""  
  
""See you,"" I replied absently.  
  
By 9 pm, a voice cut through the silence.  
  
""Why didn't you reply to my message?""  
  
I jumped. Nicholas was standing there, frustration written all over his face.  
  
""You must've been too focused to check your phone, huh?"" he said, wrapping his arms around me from behind.  
  
His embrace used to feel like home. Now it just felt suffocating.  
  
All I could picture was him holding Courtney‚Äîwhile I was covered in blood just days before.  
  
""Yeah,"" I answered flatly.  
  
""You should take a break,"" he said softly, but his touch felt heavy.  
  
He proudly set down a package. ""Anyway, I picked up bubble tea for you. Got two flavors‚Äîmatcha and Thai tea. Which one do you want?""  
  
I didn't even look up from my screen. ""No thanks, Nick. Really. It's too late for something that heavy.""  
  
It was 9 pm. I hadn't eaten past 7 for years. Had he really forgotten?  
  
Then again, maybe I just wasn't on his mind anymore.  
  
""You're right,"" he said, trying again. ""But sometimes it's okay to cheat a little. You work hard‚Äîyou need the energy.""  
  
Cheat. The word hung in the air.  
  
Like you've been cheating with Courtney? I wanted to say.  
  
But instead, I just repeated, ""No. Thanks.""  
  
He sighed and sat down next to me. ""Look,"" he began, trying to sound cheerful. ""I know I messed up this morning. But I'll make it up to you. I'll have the chef come tomorrow and cook all your favorites. How does that sound?""  
  
""Good,"" I said coldly.  
  
""I also told your manager to lighten your load. After you finish this task, you're free.""  
  
  
  
Chapter 4  
  
He puffed up with pride, like he'd just handed me the world.  
  
But honestly? It worked in my favor. The sooner I wrapped things up, the sooner I could leave. So I turned to him and forced a soft smile. ""I'm really grateful to have you on my side, Nick.""  
  
It was all an act.  
  
He brightened and leaned in to kiss me, but I turned my face at the last second. His lips landed awkwardly on my cheek.  
  
""Finish up,"" he said, trying to hide the awkwardness. ""We'll go home together. I'll just run to the bathroom real quick.""  
  
The moment he left, his phone buzzed. A message from Courtney:  
  
\[Courtney\]: Why did you buy every flavor? I only like chocolate and strawberry. I sent the rest back to you. Did you get them?  
  
I let out a bitter laugh.  
  
So the bubble tea wasn't for me. It was Courtney's leftovers.  
  
Petty? Maybe. But I grabbed my phone and texted her from my number:  
  
\[Freida\]: Courtney, Nick mentioned you didn't want the bubble tea. I gave it to security‚ÄîI don't eat after 7. Hope that's okay.  
  
She replied almost instantly:  
  
\[Courtney\]: Don't worry. I gave the strawberry and chocolate ones to my dog. He loved them.  
  
I gripped my phone so hard my knuckles turned white.  
  
""How rude!"" I hissed.  
  
""Why are you cursing?"" Nicholas's voice came from behind me.  
  
I quickly locked my phone and forced a smile. ""Nothing. Just‚Ä¶ work frustration.""  
  
He didn't look convinced, but he let it go. ""You always work too hard, Freida. Let's go home.""  
  
I nodded silently, gathering my things, my mind racing.  
  
That night, as we got ready for bed, Nicholas started talking about his upcoming business trip to Paris‚Äîwith Courtney.  
  
""What souvenir do you want this time?"" he asked, lying down beside me.  
  
""Just take care of yourself. I don't want anything.""  
  
His expression darkened. ""Since when did you become so cold?"" he demanded, sitting up suddenly.  
  
""Me? Cold?"" I shot back. ""Isn't that you?""  
  
""What are you talking about? I've always paid attention to you.""  
  
He paused, then continued like he'd figured it out. ""Oh, the breakfast thing? You're still upset about that? I said I'll make it up to you. Just because I forgot you're allergic to peanuts doesn't mean I don't care.""  
  
I sat up, unable to take it anymore. ""Maybe you forgot because you're too busy remembering someone else's preferences.""  
  
He stared at me, anger flashing in his eyes. ""You're blaming me over something that trivial? Do you have any idea how much I'm handling as CEO? Cut me some slack.""  
  
He grabbed my shoulder. ""I can't stand overly sensitive women. You used to get that.  
  
But now? Now you're just an annoying nag.""  
  
I laughed bitterly. ""I annoy you, Mr. Richmond? Then fire me. Clearly I've committed some unforgivable crime.""  
  
""Enough with the jokes, Frey,"" he snapped before storming off to the guest room.  
  
Another night alone. Another silent punishment.  
  
I wondered, not for the first time, what was even the point of us living together.  
  
The next morning, I dragged myself downstairs and picked at the breakfast the chef had made. I wasn't hungry, but I didn't want to be rude.  
  
I was twirling spaghetti on my fork when Nicholas walked in.  
  
""Since your work is done, take the day off,"" he said flatly.  
  
I didn't look up.  
  
He slid a tablet toward me. ""In return, make a birthday cake. Exactly like this one.""  
  
I glanced down. My stomach dropped.  
  
It was a fondant cake with a detailed female figure on top. Courtney.  
  
Any warmth I'd felt last night‚Äîwhen he'd talked about reducing my workload‚Äîvanished in an instant.  
  
I snorted. ""You can buy‚Äî""  
  
""I only like your cakes,"" he interrupted. ""If you don't make it, I'll have your manager dump the entire team's workload on you. Your choice.""  
  
His words were a slap. The old Nicholas was back.  
  
I sighed. ""Fine. I'll make the cake.""  
  
""Good. Use this card for the ingredients. Let me know when it's done."" He dropped a credit card on the table.  
  
""Yeah,"" I said shortly, taking the tablet and the card.  
  
I had no choice. If the team's work landed on me, my resignation would be delayed. I couldn't let that happen.  
  
So I would make a birthday cake for his mistress.  
  
And once it was done‚Ä¶ I would finally be free of him.

Instead, we‚Äôre hoping to celebrate with a really great **dinner the night of the wedding**. We‚Äôre looking for something upscale but not necessarily overly formal (however formal recs are also welcome) we just mainly want somewhere memorable, with great food and atmosphere. Ideally near **Lake Louise or Banff**.

I‚Äôve uploaded our itinerary as well. If you have any other recommendations or suggestions based on that, please let me know! This will be everyone‚Äôs first time in Banff, and since my family isn't *super* active, I tried to keep the hiking to a minimum while still mixing in a good variety of experiences.

Thanks so much in advance üíõ

I‚Äôve been listening to the Joe Rogan Experience for a while now, and one thing that‚Äôs been bugging me is how Jamie, the show‚Äôs producer and resident tech wizard, is often treated by Joe and his guests. Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚ÄîJamie‚Äôs incredible at his job. He pulls up clips, articles, and obscure facts in seconds, often under pressure, and he does it with such professionalism. But it‚Äôs rare to hear a simple ‚Äúplease‚Äù or ‚Äúthank you‚Äù directed his way. It feels like Joe and most guests just expect him to jump at their commands without a hint of courtesy. I get it, it‚Äôs a fast-paced show, and Jamie‚Äôs role is to keep things moving smoothly behind the scenes. But still, a little acknowledgment would go a long way.

I can only recall a couple of guests who made a point to be polite to Jamie. Mikey Musumeci, the jiu-jitsu champ, stood out to me because he actually said ‚Äúplease‚Äù when asking Jamie to pull something up, and it felt so refreshing. I think Graham Hancock might‚Äôve done the same, though I‚Äôm not 100% sure. Those moments are rare, though. Most of the time, it‚Äôs just ‚ÄúJamie, pull this up‚Äù or ‚ÄúJamie, can you find that?‚Äù with no warmth or gratitude. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre being rude on purpose, but it comes off like they‚Äôre ordering a servant rather than addressing a skilled professional who‚Äôs integral to the show‚Äôs success.

I know the dynamic is casual, and Joe‚Äôs known for his laid-back vibe, but even in a chill environment, basic manners matter. Jamie‚Äôs not just some intern‚Äîhe‚Äôs a key part of why the podcast runs so smoothly. He‚Äôs juggling multiple screens, fact-checking on the fly, and dealing with the chaos of live conversations that can veer into any topic at any moment. A simple ‚ÄúHey Jamie, could you please grab that clip?‚Äù or a quick ‚ÄúThanks, man, you‚Äôre a legend‚Äù would probably mean a lot to him. It‚Äôs not about being formal; it‚Äôs about showing respect for someone who‚Äôs killing it in their role.

This isn‚Äôt just about Jamie, either. It‚Äôs a broader thing‚Äîhow often do we overlook the people who make things happen behind the scenes? Whether it‚Äôs a podcast producer, a sound engineer, or even the barista at your local coffee shop, a little gratitude can make someone‚Äôs day. I‚Äôm not saying Joe or his guests are bad people‚Äîfar from it. They‚Äôre probably just caught up in the moment. But small gestures of kindness, like saying ‚Äúplease‚Äù or ‚Äúthank you,‚Äù can have a ripple effect. It sets a tone of mutual respect, and honestly, it just makes the vibe better for everyone.

I‚Äôd love to hear what you all think. Am I overthinking this, or have you noticed it too? Are there other podcasts where the behind-the-scenes crew gets more love? Or maybe I‚Äôm just projecting because I‚Äôve worked in roles where I wished for a bit more appreciation. Either way, I think Jamie deserves a shoutout for holding it down, and I hope Joe and future guests sprinkle in a few more ‚Äúpleases‚Äù and ‚Äúthank yous‚Äù to show him some love.",0,1757129931.0,JoeRogan,4,0.5,False
1n9pf67,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1n9pf67/i_asked_about_a_cousin_i_hadnt_seen_in_years_and/,I asked about a cousin I hadn‚Äôt seen in years and learned something disturbing,"Today I went over to my parents‚Äô place for lunch. We were just hanging out, chatting after coffee, and out of nowhere I remembered this cousin of mine from my mom‚Äôs side. Let‚Äôs call him James. I realized I hadn‚Äôt seen him since we were both teenagers. He was one of those cousins you only see at family gatherings, but I always remembered him as a fun kid. We‚Äôd finish eating before the adults and run off to play together.

I casually asked my parents whatever happened to him, and the whole vibe in the room changed instantly. My dad tried to change the subject so fast it was almost comical. Later, when I was alone with my mom, I pressed her a bit and she finally told me.

Apparently when James was little, like 5 or 6, he had this disturbing habit. Every time he was left alone with an older person, family, teachers, even neighbors, he would try to kiss them. Not a little peck either. He would actually grab people and try to make out with them. It was always adults or older teens, never kids his own age.

He tried it with his own sister who was a lot older than him, his mom, his dad, teachers, even parents of his friends. Obviously this caused all kinds of uncomfortable situations. His parents at first thought maybe he had seen something on TV and tried to explain, but he just wouldn‚Äôt stop. If he was stopped, he would cry and throw a tantrum, then try again later like nothing happened.

As he grew older and stronger, it became impossible to manage. By the time he was 12, his parents basically had to move away and get him into treatment. That‚Äôs why I never saw him again. My mom says he‚Äôs now an adult but still difficult, and apparently he resents his parents for putting him through therapy.

I honestly don‚Äôt even know how to feel about this. My memory of him was just a sweet cousin I‚Äôd play with, but now I‚Äôm sitting here trying to process this really unsettling story",4,1757129842.0,self,1,0.83,False

1n9pecx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n9pecx/the_crawl/,The Crawl,"I went to a strange summer camp as a child. I think something terrible happened there.

I'm a college grad who moved back to my hometown. Recently, I got coffee with an old friend who I'l call S, paid for with the coupon perks graciously provided by my internship with the local historic society. We've been doing this recently, meeting downtown to catch up and swap stories about our childhoods here.

My main job consists of digitizing tapes from the town's archive and cataloguing them, cross-referencing with newspapers and local residents if they're still alive. Recently, I discovered a tape.

I've been trying to make a timeline of my own history here, too. School field trips. Bonfires. Swim lessons. It gets fuzzy around the edges every time I concentrate on any one memory for too long, like someone is gently sweeping the curtains closed. I do my best to give my full attention to S when she speaks, committing her words to memory. I can always write notes later. 

Sometimes I worry she thinks I started talking to her again just to get the answers I want. Granted, that is why I reached out to her in the first place, but it has also been a generally pleasant time, external circumstances and investigations aside.

So we sat, sipping our drinks. A lull in the conversation. Around us, a few other customers tapped on keyboards or chatted in small clusters. Finally, I asked,

""Do you remember summer camp?"" 

Her eyes lit up at this. She took a long gulp of her latte before setting it down.

""Which part?""

""I don't know... all of it I guess."" 

S squinted and looked down her nose at me, head tilted. She made that face at me a lot when we were kids. Usually when I was saying something sort of dumb or strange. Or when I was attempting to lie, which is admittedly not one of my strong suits.

""Did Graves put you up to this?""

""No."" I hadn't even told my boss I'd been speaking to S recently. ""I just wanted to..."" Know what happened? Get answers? Too pushy. ""reminisce."" S raised an eyebrow, but seemed to accept this.

""Remember the Crawl?"" S said, laughing. ""That was hardcore.""

I did. 

At Camp Gloaming, every camper was required to be a proficient swimmer before we could participate in any other lake activities. The Crawl was the ultimate test. It was a badge of honor and the source of my absolute dread. In the early hours of the morning, after the counselors herded us onto the docks in pods of five, we dove in. Our counselor assured us with a toothy grin he'd be on guard in case anything went wrong. This did little to assuage my anxiety. 

He blew the whistle, and the trial began.

I don't remember how far we swam. It felt like miles. It felt like forever.

I am not a strong swimmer even now. Back then, I was abysmal. No matter how many hours I put into practicing alongside my cabin-mates, they always seemed leagues ahead. At some point, I switched to the sidestroke, but even that became difficult to maintain as my arms grew steadily exhausted. I was sure that any minute now, my muscles would give out and I would sink like a stone.

When I thrust my head back to the shore, either to call for help or to orient myself, I found that I could not see the docks. I did see a distant stretch of sand, tinted gray in the soft morning light. It was deserted. 

I looked forward again and saw only the flat empty waters of Lake Abel stretching out into the fog, still and silent as ever. I couldn't see S or the other three kids on our team. Were they really so far ahead? I craned my neck, treading water, trying to spot the tops of heads bobbing in the distance. 

Nothing. Panic wrapped itself around me in thick coils. I was losing strength with every kick. If nothing else, I had to keep my mouth and nose above water.

Something closed around my left ankle. 

Its cold, firm grip held me in place like an anchor, yet it was strangely soft to the touch.

It felt like fingers.

As it pulled me under, I gulped in water without meaning to, cold and harsh against my throat.

And I was drowning.

For a terrible, endless moment, my world was going dark. A fuzzy blackness closed in on the edges of my vision. I wondered distantly if I was going to die here in silence, failing my swim exam.

I thrashed once, twice, until finally I kicked free. The fingers loosened their grip, though I felt nails biting into my skin hard enough to leave marks.

I rose to the surface, my lungs burning, my body full of icy water.

I remember screaming something. I think it might've been S's name. Either way, she was the one who I saw paddling back towards me from out of the fog. She was the one who scooped her hands under my arms, kicking her feet to hold us both aloft until I could take in deep breaths of air again.

Recounting this, S winced. ""Damn. I totally forgot how traumatizing that was for you. I shouldn't have led with that one.""

I said it was fine. Remembering was good. This was a good thing.

""Wait, what was the deal with you getting grabbed?"" 

I froze. ""Some kid playing a prank, probably.""

""Oh my god yeah, I think it was that kid Cain. He was such a jerk back then.""

That we could agree on. 

""Anyways, so I'm taking a gap year to focus on myself before I head to grad school. And you've got this whole archivist thing going? Look at us!"" I could tell S wanted to change the subject so I obliged, nodding along and giving my usual spiel about the historic society. 

""It seems like you're really passionate about this project,"" she said. 

""I am,"" I found myself responding. To my surprise, I meant it. Ever since I unlocked that dusty storage closet in the back of the town hall offices and digitized the first tape, this job has felt more like an undertaking. It was work that needed doing.

It's easier for me to talk with S than with other people. It's nice. For whatever reason, my mind feels quieter around her, more whole. I can almost imagine that we're back in school.

- .75oz Laphroaig Scotch 
- .75oz Polomo Mezcal
- .75oz Three Floyds BustHeed Aquavit

Now to tame them. 
- generous .25oz Honey syrup (1:1 with water) 
- .5oz Galiano Coffee liquer
- .75oz orange juice

Add, shake with ice, and strain into a glass with an exceptionally large cube

Dare I say, but it is actually good.  Potent! The abv of these spirits are higher than normal (aside from the scotch). The honey blends with the smoke in such a fantastic way and paired with the orange juice it finds a way to lower the bitter, harsh herbal pungency of the Aquavit. It looks terrible, but damn, I found a use for the Three Things I Hate.

What are your hated spirits? How can you add them all into one cocktail to master them?

Background: had tonsillectomy done, brushing every meal and i still have bb. But when i got a job 5 years ago, it is so busy that I don‚Äôt get to eat at the right time to the point that i need to make sure i eat (at 5am) my breakfast before going to work because for sure, if i don‚Äôt, i will be hypoglycemic since i won‚Äôt be able to do so until lunch time which is at 11am if I‚Äôm lucky, otherwise it can be later than 1:30pm or later‚Ä¶ so that has been my routine, eating and eating and eating even when i don‚Äôt feel hungry at all, scared of when my next meal gonna be so i gotta eat NOW. been doing this for like 5 years now that i never even realized I don‚Äôt even remember feeling my stomach empty‚Ä¶ 

So a coworker told me that she had  gastric emptying test done and she had to have surgery because of that‚Ä¶

And then i realized maybe that‚Äôs my problem‚Ä¶ so i ate that day like the usual until dinner,, then the next day, i only had coffee (24 oz but been sipping here and there for at least 4 hours until i finish it all), and never ate anything but that‚Ä¶ it has been 18 hours since my last meal and i still don‚Äôt feel my stomach feeling empty‚Ä¶

So, i started taking domperidone and a glass of water as soon as i wake up, ginger tea for digestion, then some instant oats with lots of water then coffee..

Apparently, coffee slows down motility so eating food prior to that helps with that.. also, i have eaten lesser food and also don‚Äôt eat until my stomach feels empty‚Ä¶ i avoid breads now, pizza and cheese‚Ä¶ it has only been a week and i feel like i have improved. I asked my son for feedback and he has always been honest espc my BB and he said it doesn‚Äôt smell at all.. so we will see.. i am really hoping this is it‚Ä¶ 

I wish i could do a gastric emptying test asap but my doctor isn‚Äôt available until 2 months from now‚Ä¶

1n9p95d,https://i.redd.it/367x3bijrgnf1.jpeg,"Robots are cool, a DD","Richtech Robotics A Due Diligence

Currently trading at 3-3.2$ a share and I am convinced it will be trading above 100$ within a five to ten year time horizon.

Fundamentals and Overview Richtech defines their company mission as, ‚ÄúBy harnessing the power of collaborative robotic solutions, Richtech is redefining the service industry landscape. Our mission is to drive a revolutionary automation of tasks, enhancing customer experiences, and enabling businesses to unlock their full potential.‚Äù

‚ÄúRichtech Robotics partners with NVIDIA through the NVIDIA Connect program to integrate NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing technologies, such as the Jetson Orin platform and Isaac Sim, into their service robots like Adam and Scorpion. This collaboration enhances Richtech's robots with improved body movement detection accuracy, faster development times through simulation, and more efficient navigation in complex environments. The partnership aims to accelerate Richtech's mission to make AI-driven service robots a common sight in industries such as hospitality, retail, and restaurants.‚Äù As we have seen over the last five to ten years, NVIDIA has become the industry leader in the AI and semiconductor market. With a market cap of over 4.4 trillion dollars, NVIDIA is positioned as the backbone of the technological landscape for the foreseeable future. Because of this, NVIDIA will be able to consistently supply Richtech with the most up to date technology for their line of robotics. Additionally, NVIDIA has a 50% voting share of the company so will be able to guide them financially as they make their transition from unprofitable to profitable.

Market Opportunity A majority of my positive sentiment comes from the FACT that low-skill jobs will be phased out of existence within a 10-20 year time horizon. I believe trade skills (electricians, mechanics, etc.) will be one of the few blue collar job markets that will survive the coming AI and tech revolution. However, back to low-skill jobs, I fully believe jobs like assembly line workers, fast food workers, cashiers, hostesses and waiters, taxi and uber drivers, and many more will become obsolete as robotics transition into becoming a cheaper labor option. Yes, I know a majority of robotics companies are in the very early trial phase, and many of the existing prototypes have not become fully functional. While that may be a bearish sign for the robotics market now, I believe it only provides RR with less barriers to entry in the coming years. As I said before, Richtech is financially backed by NVIDIA and operates on their platforms. This allows RR to put more focus into the development of their robotics as they have a 4.4 trillion dollar market giant lining their pockets.

Enough about NVIDIA, let‚Äôs continue to discuss RR‚Äôs market opportunity in the future. As consumer and commercial robotics transition into the global labor market, companies like Richtech have the opportunity to become the face of an entirely new industry. I really love this stock, and believe robotics poses a similar market opportunity to Apple in 2008. As we have seen with every form of new technology that comes out, initial reactions are typically all over the place, often siding towards skepticism.

Historical Examples Steve Ballmer (former CEO of Microsoft) said this, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance.‚Äù Yeah okay bud, how did that turn out for you.

Or similarly, look at the public reaction to the current AI revolution. This is not to say that there is always a bad reaction as new technology is released, just that the public often sides towards skepticism vs optimism. Robotics is currently the center of one of these optimism vs. skepticism debates in regards to its long term potential. This is why I believe now is the best buying opportunity for robotics and robotics stocks. This is a situation where we have the chance to buy that metaphorical iPhone at its release (i.e robotics). Don‚Äôt be a Steve Balmer, look beyond the next few years!

Technology and Software Richtech Robotics currently has seven operational robot models with a variety of functions.

Competitors/Current Market Landscape

Richtech Robotics is taking aim at the low skill job industry I spoke about earlier with their service industry robotics. Industry analysts point to a market with few pure-play automation names to lean on. Serve Robotics is one comparable, though it focuses more on autonomous delivery, while titans like ABB, Siemens, and Rockwell Automation dominate factory-floor automation Meanwhile, established robotics firms such as Intuitive Surgical shine in medical automation. At its core, Richtech‚Äôs competitive edge lies in its niche deployment in hospitality, health, and cleaning. I believe that these three industries could be some of the most affected by the upcoming robotic revolution. The company has already deployed over 300 robots across the U.S., blending proof-points with scale. RR is positioned to become the Apple, Google, Tesla of the robotics industry by 2030.

Future Potential

I fully believe to my core that Richtech stands on the brink of something big, even though the path might be a longer journey. The global retail automation market is projected to reach $25 billion by 2030, highlighting the magnitude of opportunity ahead. They recently signed two-year Master Services Agreement (with auto-renewal) with a major retailer signals a breakthrough in actual channel penetration and investor sentiment. For example, the stock soared 23% on that news alone. Add to that the Walmart ghost-kitchen deployments running Richtech robots in dozens of locations and the revenue potential becomes very tangible. These locations are each projected to pull in between $700,000 and $2 million annually. Pair this with Richtech‚Äôs 76% gross margin and strong solvency score (81/100), and you‚Äôve got a company that isn‚Äôt just spending its cash left and right, it has a robust financial base to reinvest aggressively.

On the flip side, risks are real: analysts widely forecast price targets in the $2.50‚Äì$3.50 range, with an average near current levels. This implies modest to minimal short term upside. Freedom Broker recently downgraded RR to Sell, citing overvaluation and the need for more deliverables from its retailer partners before they‚Äôll reconsider.

This poses a good buying opportunity for us. Many may still be thinking like Steve Balmer regarding the iPhone. Public perception still thinks robotics may be a fad or may never be able to ‚Äúcapture the market share.‚Äù All that aside, robotics has been framed as ""the next era"" by Nvidia‚Äôs CEO himself. So, Richtech is very much in the spotlight. Not only that, but its use of Nvidia‚Äôs scalable AI platform is an edge no current robotics competitor can replicate.

TL;DR

If you just want to read a paragraph, here you go:

Richtech Robotics (RR), trading at ~$3 today, backed by Nvidia, has seven operating service industry robots. Robotics has infinite market opportunities in retail, hospitality, and healthcare. I believe this is undeniably reminiscent of early-stage Apple circa 2008. Current verdict: strong margin profile, robust cash and solvency, tangible large-scale deployments en route. I believe that proof of consistent revenue execution is the crucial next step towards a robotics revolution. If you‚Äôre in for being a long-term investor, I have unwavering faith that RR could be the next Apple-like stock within the next 10-15 years.",2,1757129298.0,AsymmetricAlpha,0,1.0,False

Back story, I needed a new job that had tips and was able to work with my busy schedule during college, I had always loved 7 Brew as a customer so when a new coffee stand was opening near me I decided to apply.  Here's somethings that already have me searching for a new job only one month in of being employed.
1. After shift meetings- After my shift I am asked to clock out and go outside for a ""powwow"" which is a mandatory meeting to go over our shift that day. While this doesn't happen much anymore these meetings were off the clock spanning from 10 to 15 minutes each, one or two even being around 25 to 30 minutes long. I believe this is illegal.
2. Mandatory Readings/Replies to GroupMe Messages- When I am off the clock, I am REQUIRED to go onto our group chat and read and reply ""heard"" or react with an emoji to messages sent by shift leads about mistakes and such. While this takes only about 5 minutes of my day it is still mandatory and I am not allowed to not reply to them.
3. Tips- My stand pays 11 dollars an hour plus tips, however, these tips ARE NOT guaranteed to employees unless they pass a 100 question test with AT LEAST a 90. This test is made difficult enough that even when trained me and other coworkers have to study to even make a decent score. And this test is largely on blended drinks THAT WE BARELY MAKE because most people just order standard drinks. I swear at least 30 questions were on chillers when I have made maybe 5 while Ive worked there this past month.
4. Late Policy- While I am not often late and this shouldn't be a problem this rule has absolutely shocked me. The policy spans between a 3 month period FYI. If I am late once within this period I have to clock out of tips for my whole shift. Late twice I have to clock out of tips for the next whole week I am scheduled. And then 3 times is a write up i believe. Again this isnt a big issue but still insanely strict for an 11 dollar per hour job and a wide span of time for this policy.
5. Taking Orders During Bad Weather- While this one isnt much of an issue, during rain (even heavy rain) as long as there isnt lighting or thunder employees have to go out in the rain to take orders (under the cover of a ""pod"" however). I mostly feel bad for customers cause we have to make them roll down their windows during rain and take their order. Last time this happened my shoes were soaked the rest of my shift (4 hours) and my feet were freezing.
I am not trying to complain much but I genuinelySh have never hated a job so much in my life. I am a good worker and put my best in at all of my jobs but I cant even come close to liking this one. I mean I dont even make tips customers tip me because the test is so hard.
Edit: To specify what advice I need,
1. Should I report this?
2. Am I over reacting?
3. Has someone had a similar experience?
Hopefully I can find a new job soon üôè 
Wish me luck and honestly dont recommend working here whatsoever.

The next thing I heard was my husband yell expletives. I came out just in time to see a grey furball literally fly and dive into the lower crevices of my sofa.

I died, got resurrected (because kids have to go to school), contacted their most useless customer service and died again just because of the sheer stupidity of this situation.

We have cctv footage and also videos of the society staff capturing the rat. Now that we have the item, do you think they will accept a return and refund considering it‚Äôs slightly damaged?

But in all seriousness, I have had so many rotten and questionable perishable items delivered to my house. This takes the cake. The customer support hasn‚Äôt taken any action beyond an I am sorry and tried to push back on the refund of the items in the same bag. They also tried to collect the box and cup with the rat droppings in it once we mentioned that we found it in the coffee case. We got the refund on the 3rd callback.

First incident (DOCO):
My daughter was approached by a young woman while a man lingered nearby. The woman told her she was ‚Äúexploring Sacramento‚Äù and asked if my daughter knew of any good coffee shops. She also mentioned she was from Stockton and worked as an electrician. Before leaving, she asked for my daughter‚Äôs Instagram, saying maybe they could hang out sometime. My daughter (naively) gave it to her.

Second incident (Temple Coffee downtown):
A few days later, while at Temple Coffee, two young women came up to her ‚Äî and they used the exact same wording: they said they were ‚Äúexploring Sacramento‚Äù and wanted to know where they could find some good coffee shops. My daughter was on the phone at the time, but they still pressed her for recommendations. They circled back a second time, repeated the same script, claimed one of them went to UC Davis, and again asked for her Instagram ‚Äúin case they forgot the places she mentioned.‚Äù Strangely, they never ordered anything.

Follow-up:
After telling me, my daughter agreed it felt off and unfollowed them. One of the accounts immediately tried to re-follow her. 

Why I‚Äôm posting:
Both encounters involved young women using the same exact lines (‚Äúexploring Sacramento‚Äù and ‚Äúwhere are the good coffee shops?‚Äù) and pushing for my daughter‚Äôs Instagram.

1n9owbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1n9owbd/where_the_fuck_is_my_package_mansly/,Where the fuck is my package Mansly?!,"So. End of last month (good ol' August), I ordered a 128gb SD card, external SD card reader and a nurse costume for halloween reasons. The card is for modding a 3ds I have, and the card reader is for reading it because modern computer towers typically don't come with the readers anymore. 

Got these off of Amazon, because I live in a fuckoff tiny town in the middle of bumfuck nowheres populated by hicks (B.C Edition). I should specify I live in Canada, and typically I've gotten all of my orders from Canada Post. Kind of obvious but this is important to the story here. The only exceptions have been from ordering PC stuff from Razer, and those get sent to my local Staples since they're the ones to recieve USPS packages.

So, yesterday stuff is delayed because of road construction. Fine, cool, whatever. Not mad about that, actually really happy because the road in question was queued up for paving for over a month. It's *also* right outside of my apartment. HOWEVER. Said paving only lasted yesterday. What I didn't anticipate for was the delivery company being absolute garbage. Because in an ideal world, I would've had my package today. Typically I'm fine with delays because shit happens, but this entire week has been Bad‚Ñ¢Ô∏è so I'm just a touch pissed this time around.

Enter in Intelcom/Dragonfly. 44 reviews in my local area, with a 1.1 star rating. People have reported packages being thrown, left at the very end of their driveways where people can just take them, left in horrendous weather conditions or never showing up at all. No one has had good experience with them. There's a number that's only hooked into a province across the country, with no number being associated in my town. So they're basically uncontactable. I did call them, by the way. They couldn't help me! 

(I should also mention that the tracker hasn't been updated since yesterday!)

I ended up walking down to the local warehouse myself. Place was abandoned. No lights, no vehicles, nobody. Their site said they were open until 11pm, however looking locally said they were closed permanently. The office space was just loaded up with tires, and all of the shipping bays were empty save for 3 lone parcels. They even still had mail from the local goverment saying they had to renew their insurance soon. I almost decided to finger write my phone number onto one of the dusty loading bay windows just to see if they would call me. 

So now I've reordered my stuff, with the additional instructions of: ""Do not ship with Intelcom, deliver with Canada Post."" I'm giving the original package a week to show up, and if it does magically show I'm selling my buddy the additional SD card and the accompanying reader. Primarily because I already know I will have to either do the 3ds modding myself or play tech support, and while I love my friend(s) they're not the brightest bulb in the pack. So it's primarily for my time and/or effort, rather than pure monitary gain. The additional nurse costume will be used if I need to make a back-up, since I plan on cosplaying one of the Nurses from Silent Hill and in order to get that *grunge* on the uniform I have to stain it with tea and coffee.

1n9ovl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1n9ovl4/rr_just_listed_options_heres_why_it_could_rocket/,"RR Just listed Options, Here‚Äôs why it could rocket","Alright, hear me out. $RR (Richtech Robotics) just got options listed this week, and what we‚Äôre seeing right now is one of those rare cases where fundamentals, technicals, and options flow all line up. If you understand the mechanics, this play starts to make a lot of sense.
1. The fundamentals you can‚Äôt ignore. RR is not a hollow meme ticker. They‚Äôre in AI robotics, with real products already in use: bartending robots, coffee barista bots, delivery bots, cleaning bots, etc.
Balance sheet is good with cash heavy, zero debt. That‚Äôs rare for a microcap. Commercial deployments + partnerships with big players = real revenue, not just promises. Compared to $OPEN, RR has a smaller float (100m approx.), and imo, much bigger upside. If AI robotics really takes off, RR could be a 10x story.
So from a fundamentals perspective, the company isn‚Äôt trash, it actually has legs.
2. The double squeeze feedback Loop
Here‚Äôs where the real squeeze mechanics kick in:
Gamma Squeeze: Retail piles into calls ‚Üí MMs hedge by buying shares ‚Üí stock rises.
Short Squeeze: Stock rises ‚Üí shorts get margin called ‚Üí forced to cover ‚Üí stock rises more.
Feedback Loop: More calls = more hedging = higher stock. Higher stock = shorts covering = even higher stock. The two forces literally fuel each other. This is exactly the kind of setup that made $GME and $AMC go nuclear. Difference is RR‚Äôs options are brand new, float is small, and sentiment hasn‚Äôt gone mainstream yet.
3. Let‚Äôs get specific, some quick math.
Based on RR‚Äôs float: 100M shares approx. To move the stock meaningfully, you probably need about 10‚Äì20M shares of buying pressure. Now through calls: 1 contract = 100 shares. Delta = % of hedge per contract. (for example at 0.3 delta, 1 contract = 30 shares hedged. At 1.0 delta, 1 contract = 100 shares hedged.)
Here are some examples:
Example 1: Bigger scale 200k contracts bought. Exposure = 200k √ó 100 = 20M shares. At 0.3 delta = 6M shares hedged. If delta ‚Üí 1 = 20M shares hedged = 20% approx. of float. That alone could stress supply and rip the stock.
Example 2. Retail collective Say 40k retail traders each spend $15. That‚Äôs $600k total. At $150 per contract ‚Üí 4k contracts. 4k contracts √ó 100 = 400k shares exposure. At 0.3 delta = 120k shares hedged. If stock rises, this scales to 400k shares.

Example 3. Smaller crowd with bigger size 400 traders each spend $1,500 = $600k again. Same 4k contracts ‚Üí same 400k shares exposure. Math is the same, scale just depends on participation style. The point is: you don‚Äôt need hedge fund billions. A few million in call premiums spread across thousands of retail traders can create a multi million share buying obligation for MMs.
4. Why this matters now:
RR already touched $3.80 above this week, showing buyers are active. Options chain is fresh, liquidity is thin, it‚Äôs perfect conditions for gamma ramp. Short interest adds fuel: rising stock forces shorts to cover, and that pushes delta even higher. This is the rare kind of self reinforcing setup: Calls bought ‚Üí MMs hedge ‚Üí stock up. Stock up ‚Üí shorts cover ‚Üí stock up more. Stock up more ‚Üí deltas expand ‚Üí even more hedging. Loop repeats.
TL;DR
RR has solid and very well fundamentals. Small float + fresh options = perfect playground for gamma mechanics. Gamma + short squeeze are not separate events, they feed each other in a loop. We don‚Äôt need to YOLO billions but a few thousand contracts can scale into millions of shares of forced buying. Not financial advice, but imo this is one of the cleanest asymmetric setups on the market right now.",10,1757128102.0,WallStreetbetsELITE,7,1.0,False

By trade I'm a pilot. Many ratings and thousands of hours in dozens of planes. Most recently I was in management and trained pilots. I've recently decided to go back to flying. I also have a white collar professional side-gig that I do. (Not uber eats or uber lol!!!)

I‚Äôm a divorced dad with a 12-year-old daughter, and we do the 50/50 custody thing. My ex and I actually get along (I know, shocking), and people compliment us on how drama-free it is. Honestly, you could grab a coffee with her and she‚Äôd probably give me a decent Yelp review. Joking lol (we are divorced for reason haha)

After the divorce (my idea), I did the whole ‚Äúpersonal growth‚Äù thing. No baggage, no ‚Äúcrazy ex‚Äù stories‚Äîjust came out the other side in a solid spot.

I‚Äôm looking for a relationship where 1+1 = 3. A partnership that‚Äôs fun, a little banter, some random adventures, and actual teamwork when it comes to building a great life. I‚Äôm easygoing, kind, adaptable, and rely way more on common sense than textbooks (though I did get the degree).

I‚Äôve traveled a lot (military brat perks), five continents and counting. Would love someone who‚Äôs adventurous, funny, honest, and can handle both a Bolivian mountain hike at 13,000 feet and a Netflix marathon without complaint.

I‚Äôm an extroverted introvert; social, but I also appreciate my recharge time. Not materialistic, but thankfully not broke either. I‚Äôve got my own place, my own car, and a solid job. My dad raised me old school: build a guitar? Done. Fix a car? Done. Random home repair? Done (eventually).

I‚Äôm not in a rush, but I‚Äôd love to find someone fun, grounded, and ready to build something strong. And yeah, long-distance isn‚Äôt my jam; so Texas ladies, you‚Äôve got home-field advantage.

I'm the real deal. I don't have any ""gotchas"" or weird crap where I misrepresent myself and you figure it out later and go ""why did I fall for this!"" So are you ready to have a good relationship that is rarely boring, honest, has good communication, and is laughs?

I want us to feel that magnetic and emotional pull ‚Äî like the minute we lock eyes, the world becomes outside noise.

I‚Äôm 31, 5‚Äô4, Japanese-American, HWP (height weight proportionate), with long dark brown hair and bangs, and dark brown almond-shaped eyes. I‚Äôm very in touch with my feminine side. I‚Äôm based in Los Angeles and work as an instructional assistant at an elementary school while pursuing my Early Childhood Education Units, building a meaningful career in education.

A bit about me: I take care of myself and often get mistaken for being in my twenties (not going to lie, it‚Äôs fun). I love coastal drives, bookstores, traveling, writing (currently working on a horror-romance novel), and losing myself in synthwave ‚Äî right now, Chromance by Kalax is on repeat. My favorite 2000s film is The Girl Next Door. I don‚Äôt smoke or use drugs, and I drink minimally.

I love good morning texts, consistency, honesty, and emotional depth. I want the kind of romance where you pick me up at my door with flowers, and as the night ends, you‚Äôre already asking, ‚ÄúSo, when can I see you again?‚Äù No guessing games. No one left wondering or waiting.

I want a romance that makes my heart race at 100 miles per hour, where we laugh endlessly, trust and respect each other fully, and I wipe the lipstick off your lips after every kiss. I want to feel the spark, fire, and passion ‚Äî as well as the stability and calmness that comes from knowing we‚Äôre truly right for each other. I want a romance that burns so bright all because it feels so right.

I want us to feel like we‚Äôre 21 again ‚Äî full of excitement and possibility ‚Äî yet with the emotional stability of adults who know who they are. I‚Äôm looking for someone who isn‚Äôt just a fantasy, but feels like my best friend and someone I‚Äôve known my whole life. Tattoos and leather jackets are a bonus; I have three tattoos myself. Together, we could be like James Dean and Audrey Hepburn ‚Äî timeless, magnetic, unforgettable.

I‚Äôm looking for a man who is in touch with his masculine side but is highly emotionally intelligent and respectful. I like a guy with a bit of a bad boy edge ‚Äî tattoos, leather jackets, maybe a motorcycle ‚Äî but who is still a respectful, grounded, and decent man at heart. Someone who always follows through with what he says, has his own life, passions, and goals, and takes care of himself physically and emotionally. Between 30‚Äì40, tall, stable, obviously single, and carrying a dark, intriguing edge. You don‚Äôt smoke (weed, cigarettes, vaping, etc.) or use drugs. You treat wait staff with the same kindness and respect you‚Äôd show anyone else. Monogamy only. Tattoos, cars and/or motorcycles, leather jackets, and basic common sense and literacy are a HUGE bonus!

And please: send intentional, thoughtful messages. Not ‚Äúhey,‚Äù ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up,‚Äù or ‚Äúm 38. Got a pic?‚Äù Effort matters. I want a man who texts and talks like a GROWN MAN.

Picture us: riding off into the sunset on your motorcycle, laughing while we run errands together like it‚Äôs our own private inside joke, or sitting quietly at an overlook watching the city lights below ‚Äî knowing we‚Äôre exactly where we belong. And maybe later that night, we‚Äôre back under the neon glow of Los Angeles, kissing like the whole world has disappeared. Beyond that, we‚Äôll explore LA together ‚Äî from hidden coffee shops to city lights and coastal adventures ‚Äî making memories in every corner of this city. (For now, I don‚Äôt have a motorcycle or a car, but I‚Äôm planning to get one in the next 2‚Äì3 months ‚Äî so you just might be my favorite driver until then.)

Note: I‚Äôd prefer if you were in Los Angeles or Orange County ‚Äî but if you‚Äôre in the US or Canada, you‚Äôre still welcome to try. If you‚Äôre in another country, it might be difficult to make this work. If you feel that spark reading this, send me a thoughtful message ‚Äî and yes, include a photo.

Kinda wanted to give something valuable back to the community. I wanna start by thanking all of you, since your input has helped me a lot. You guys are doing awesome job in keeping this sub-reddit constructive and positive.

Here's my experience:  
A little context about me: I have 1.5 years of SDE experience (JAVA) before pursuing my master's in Machine learning and AI. This was my first interview in USA and it was very overwhelming for me.

# Before Interview

I applied through an executive referral. After few weeks, I got the invite for SDE 1 OA, cleared OA and got the interview invite on Aug, 12.  
I immediately panicked because I just graduated in May from my master's which means, I didn't do software engineering from last 2 years. And more importantly, I had been a java developer earlier and now I was learning python (not much DSA) during my course. So, I got my interview date scheduled on 4th of Sept.

I laid down the prep plan, targeting ( neetcode 75 + preparation for behavior + LLD problems almost all of them **from scratch**). Since, I didn't even touch DSA for last 2 years, I was stressed about it lot. Most of my prep went into DSA practice only. I knew I had to push myself and so I did. I managed to study for almost 10-12 hours each day, making sacrifices, and keeping it all together. I made this interview my only goal. There were days, when I felt demotivated and getting that sinking feeling, but I kept pushing. I managed to almost complete the neetcode 75 list multiple times (did not do bit manipulation) + around 10 common LLD questions, very solid because I did practice them multiple times, if not I can say that I did each question at least 3-4 times and important ones at least 5-6 times to retain the patterns in my head. I practiced visualizing the problem on pen and paper + white boarding to draw the solutions. I was quite confident on the DSA part. I also practiced my LP's answers with my friends.

# D - day

Then comes the interview day. 4th of September, I had 3 virtual interviews back to back.

**Round1 - Leadership Principles (probably Bar Raiser) :**  
I did not expect it to be my first round. The interview was a senior system's engineer. He was a very chill guy, I was nervous and he helped me calm my nerves by starting the conversation at a very positive note. I gradually gained confidence. He started off with introduction, told me about the interview process, provided me a comfortable environment  and then began the interview.

He asked me 3 questions in total.

I answered the first question in the STAR format, talking about my learnings and results. He then asked a few follow-up questions, I answered all of them. He seemed satisfied, even called that a good answer since it was covering multiple LPs.

Second question: I explained my story in STAR format and he started asking follow-ups. He dug deep into the technical details of my answer and the worst happened. I BLANKED OUT, completely. I could not answer his question anymore. I was not able to provide him the technical details on how I implemented a particular feature. I lost all my confidence. It was complete silence for a good 2 minutes. I had picked a wrong story which had some technical gaps I couldn't explain. This was worst for me. I was just blank and silent. He then moved to another question and I thought to myself at that moment that I had already fucked up, so it's doesn't even matter cause the damage was done. Anyway, I answered the third question in STAR format discussing the results and my learnings, he then asked follow-up questions, which I was able to answer, highlighting the LPs. After that we had 10 minutes, he told me about his day in Amazon and asked me if I had any questions. I asked 2-3 questions to learn more about the expectations and best practices from a new grad. I knew Amazon doesn't provide interview feedback, so I didn't ask for feedback. I think this round was my worst (5/10).

**Round2 - LPs + Coding**  
There were two people in the round: Principal data engineer (interviewer) + a shadow, both were very nice and supportive. They began with asking me about myself, and then asked 2 LP questions. I answered both their questions in STAR format, talked about my self-reflections towards the end and they seemed satisfied. No follow-ups asked. Then they pasted a question on liveCode. I can't share the question because of NDA but it was related to heaps. Upon getting the question, I asked for constraints and a test case to derive my approach. Since I had a habit of drawing on pen & paper, I asked the interviewers if I could do that. They asked me to use the liveCode instead, which I understand. I gave a brute force approach, explained my thoughts and coded the same and then discussed the time complexities. He **gave me a hint for time complexity** and I gave the correct answer.  After that I mentioned, that I could optimize it further using Heaps. He then asked me to do so. I coded the solution, explaining my approach along the way. And at the end I discussed the time & space complexities for the approach. Both were correct.

The structure was something like: There was a brute force answer and then there was an optimal solution below it with their time and space complexities commented against them. I did a sample dry run and they seemed satisfied. Since, we had only 5 minutes left, they asked me for my questions and I asked a few questions and we shared laughs at the end.

**Round3 - LPs + LLD**  
It was already 2 hours straight into the interview. The interviewer was a Senior Software Engineer with extensive experience in other MAANG companies. He seemed to be occupied with some work. I asked for a quick restroom break, since I was sipping water and coffee constantly to maintain my fluids. The interview began with 2 LP questions. I answered in STAR format and again discussed about my takeaways. No follow-ups were asked in this round. He seemed satisfied.

He then pasted the question in LiveCode and I took 2 minutes to read it multiple times. I explained the question to him to make sure I understood it correctly. I then asked for constraints and wrote them as comments in the editor. I asked for a sample test case as well.   
The question was related to graphs and I was able to discuss my optimal approach. I started coding the solution, and midway through the answer, he asked me not to write the get and set classes, just the implementation of main function. I commented the working of classes in one line anyway.  
Then I wrote the coding solution using DFS and tried explaining the working of my code line by line.  
Since, I had practiced this question, I was able to code it up fast and then I started discussing the time and space complexity. I did a dry run for the test case he provided me. The interviewer told me that it was faster than he had expected. We still had around 25 minutes left in the interview.   
  
He asked me for any questions and I took it as an opportunity to shine. I asked him fairly good questions about his experience, I had stalked all of my interviewer's linkedIn profiles, so I could ask him questions based on his profile and how he navigated his journey in Amazon. I asked for his expectations from a candidate in this role. Ngl, we shared laughs and good conversation. Then in the end I asked for an advice and he gave me a pretty solid one *'To do what you love'* and he seemed happy.

Now, as I am awaiting the results, I am stressing out a lot (thinking 24\*7) about it. I know I messed up in a high weightage round, I can't do anything about it now. What do you think my chances are ? I don't know if I'll be able to get another referral. I have lost trust in myself. I feel like I've lost a golden opportunity. I have an education loan and it'll be very difficult for me to sustain without a job in US.  
I don't know how it's gonna turn out for me. Fingers crossed!

This was all about my experience. I wanted to thank all of you for helping me out during the prep. I wish you guys all the best and I believe you.

If there's one tip I'd like to share is: *Please prepare solid for behavior rounds during amazon interviews. You don't want to blame yourself like me and regret later. This is equally important.*

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

Thank you for reading this long read. Sending you wishes.",5,1757127249.0,leetcode,3,1.0,False

1n9ojc2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n9ojc2,Semi-sweet cookies (Gluten free),"¬†Today I bring you a very simple, but nutritious recipe, ideal for a snack or to include in the children's lunchbox. And these are¬†**SEMI-SWEET COOKIES, (GLUTEN-FREE)**. These cookies are very economical, and also versatile, because although in their preparation I use two types of corn flour that are available in the town where I live, these can be substituted for another type of corn flour.

  
In the afternoons I usually drink coffee, well, to be honest I drink coffee throughout the day, but in the afternoons I like to accompany it with a snack, and as I have mentioned in other posts, I don't like food excessively sweets, because they make me sick, the only things I eat that are really sweet are candy and cinnamon tea, otherwise I try to reduce my sugar consumption. With that said, let's get to my recipe.



# THE RECIPE 



**Time, ingredients and equipment**



* Preparation time: Having all the ingredients on hand, it takes between 5 minutes to make the dough, 15 minutes for the dough to hydrate well, 5 minutes to assemble the cookies, and approximately 35 minutes of baking, so we will require approximately 1 hour to make these cookies.
* Servings: 17 units, each weighing 25 grams.

**The amounts of ingredients that I present below may vary slightly, but it is advisable to maintain the proportions. As I previously indicated, some flours can be substituted.**

* 55 grams of Cariaco corn flour. I know that it is difficult to find this flour in other places, since it is a special flour, but you can substitute it with cornstarch or nixtamalized corn flour.

* 55 grams of toasted corn flour, which in some places in my country, Venezuela, is called ‚Äúfororo‚Äù.
* 55 grams of oat flour. If you don't have oat flour at home, you can grind rolled oats, just like I did.
* 55 grams of fresh grated coconut.
* 3 tablespoons of grated coconut (for the topping). This is optional.
* 55 grams of papel√≥n or cane sugar or jaggery, grated or granulated. You can substitute another sweetener, such as palm sugar, molasses, sugar, etc. If you want the cookies to be sweeter, you can increase this amount.
* 1 egg of chia flour (1 tablespoon of ground chia + 3 tablespoons of hot water)
* 100 ml of water, approximately.
* 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil, to oil your hands and mold the cookies.
* Baking paper.
* Bowl, measuring cups, teaspoon, baking sheet, plate, etc.



# THE PROCEDURE

Prepare the chia egg, so that it hydrates for 15 minutes.

  
In a bowl, mix the dry ingredients: Cariaco corn flour, toasted corn flour, oat flour, and the grated coconut (this ingredient will provide the necessary fat to the preparation). Lastly add panela. Mix well and if necessary, use your hands so that the panela is well integrated with the flours.

Add the chia egg and mix very well. At this point the dough will be hard, so add the water progressively. The amount of water I used was 100 ml, but this can vary depending on the flour used, so it can be more or less. Knead well and let the flour rest for 15 minutes.

  
After that time, check if the dough is soft and manageable. If it is brittle, a little more water is required. Oil your fingers and form balls of similar size. Shape them into the desired shape and place them slightly apart on the tray, on top of the baking paper. In this case I made small discs of approximately 4 cm in diameter, 0.5 cm thick. The weight of each cookie was 25 grams, on average. On top of each cookie I placed a little fresh grated coconut, but this is optional.

  
Bake for 35 minutes in a preheated oven, at 180¬∞C, although this may vary depending on the oven. Remove the tray and let it cool.

  
During the baking time these cookies smelled delicious, and when I removed them from the oven the smell was even better. The flavor is very good, I like them that way, not too sweet. They are cookies with a soft texture, they are not crunchy, and they combine wonderfully with black coffee. They are also satiating, with 4 or 5 cookies you eat, you will be satisfied.

We were just hanging out, chatting after coffee, and out of nowhere I remembered this cousin of mine from my mom‚Äôs side. Let‚Äôs call him James. I realized I hadn‚Äôt seen him since we were both teenagers. He was one of those cousins you only see at family gatherings, but I always remembered him as a fun kid. We‚Äôd finish eating before the adults and run off to play together.

I casually asked my parents whatever happened to him, and the whole vibe in the room changed instantly. My dad tried to change the subject so fast it was almost comical. Later, when I was alone with my mom, I pressed her a bit and she finally told me.

Apparently when James was little, like 5 or 6, he had this disturbing habit. Every time he was left alone with an older person, family, teachers, even neighbors, he would try to kiss them. Not a little peck either. He would actually grab people and try to make out with them. It was always adults or older teens, never kids his own age.

He tried it with his own sister who was a lot older than him, his mom, his dad, teachers, even parents of his friends. Obviously this caused all kinds of uncomfortable situations. His parents at first thought maybe he had seen something on TV and tried to explain, but he just wouldn‚Äôt stop. If he was stopped, he would cry and throw a tantrum, then try again later like nothing happened.

As he grew older and stronger, it became impossible to manage. By the time he was 12, his parents basically had to move away and get him into treatment. That‚Äôs why I never saw him again. My mom says he‚Äôs now an adult but still difficult, and apparently he resents his parents for putting him through therapy.

I honestly don‚Äôt even know how to feel about this. My memory of him was just a sweet cousin I‚Äôd play with, but now I‚Äôm sitting here trying to process this really unsettling story.",13,1757126915.0,confessions,2,0.89,False
1n9oh4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetryFree/comments/1n9oh4x/i_know_this_place/,I know this place‚Ä¶,"This is a poem I‚Äôve written about a love I‚Äôve once shared with someone very special to me. It‚Äôs rather long so I do apologize for that.


I know this place‚Ä¶

It started there ‚Äî on the edge of my bed, in the hush of midnight,
when her voice cracked through the dark like a match struck in shadow:
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your fault for making me fall in love with you.‚Äù

No fanfare. No grand gesture. Just those damned words ‚Äî soft, trembling ‚Äî
and suddenly every wall I‚Äôd ever built dissolved.

The moon spilled silver across her face,
her fingers tracing mine like she was learning me for the first time.
I didn‚Äôt speak. My breath caught somewhere between lungs and throat.
Because some moments aren‚Äôt made to be filled with sound;
they‚Äôre made to be felt ‚Äî deep in bone and blood.
And from that night‚Ä¶ we became real.

‚∏ª

I turned to her and confessed that gentle sin.
I had fallen for her too, as disgraceful as it may have been.
As damaging and unknowing as it was at the time, I felt what I‚Äôd needed for so long.
And God‚Ä¶ how I lived for that need.

‚∏ª

We kissed through arguments sharp enough to draw blood ‚Äî
over small things: silence mistaken as anger, boundaries crossed, rights and wrongs.
But it was never about what we fought, it was whether we‚Äôd survive after.

And always, always, she found her way back into my arms,
as if even fury couldn‚Äôt drown what lived between us then:
this wild thing beating beneath skin and scar ‚Äî
love so fierce it refused its own death sentence each time it should‚Äôve died.

‚∏ª

There were nights she cried on my chest without words ‚Äî
just tears soaking into cotton like prayers falling mute to stone.
I held her anyway. I didn‚Äôt ask why.
I just let her break where no one else could see,
because that‚Äôs what lovers do: they become shelter,
even when they‚Äôre drowning too.

‚∏ª

There were nights where I cried in her arms.
My tears soaked the fabric of her shirt, yet she didn‚Äôt care.
As long as I was comforted and had her to lean on,
she knew that she was my shelter, and I was hers.

‚∏ª

Lighters for companionship, bracelets for promise ‚Äî
tiny relics of a love we swore would last.

‚∏ª

We had drunken nights spent wasting time
and enjoying each other‚Äôs presence, like nobody and nothing else mattered to us.
Hours and hours of loving passion ‚Äî a passion that not even the strongest blade could divide
if it cut through the two of us.
Every phone call we shared brought us closer, filled with laughter and love.

‚∏ª

But slowly, the warmth thinned out like winter light retreating behind clouds.
Her touch turned careful ‚Äî not cold yet, but cautious ‚Äî
like touching glass after fire‚Äôs gone out under flame-licked wood.

Then came silence, heavier than any shout could carry.
The questions unanswered, the promises that felt untrue.
The promises I hold to myself dearly, yet cannot be spoken between her lips anymore.
A dead end that I ran into, like a truck hitting a concrete wall.

The love she once whispered beside moonlight now sits still behind locked eyes ‚Äî
unreachable even when standing face-to-face across a room full of ghosts named memory and regret.

‚∏ª

We never had that last kiss, the one we‚Äôd hoped would never come.
We never had that last night out together, drinking coffee and eating whatever our hearts desired.
We never shared our last bit of feelings that burned like an eternal flame.
Instead, we built shells around our hearts, unreadable to each other.

‚∏ª

Her heart? Unknowing‚Ä¶but shut ‚Äî
the kind closed not by pain, but choice.

And mine? Mine beats in unsteady echoes now:
a drum without rhythm, a pulse missing its reason.
Still holding space for someone who no longer lives here.
Still waking up reaching for warmth long since left.
Still loving past due date; past logic; past dignity even.
Still writing poems nobody will read but pain understands well enough.

‚∏ª

Because sometimes letting go isn‚Äôt one act, it‚Äôs thousands:
each breath where I remember not to call, each song I skip, each photo hidden or saved ‚Äî
though every view cuts deeper.
Every moment I catch myself hoping against proof that maybe tonight, maybe tonight,
she‚Äôll indulge once again, like nothing ever changed.

‚∏ª

But nothing has changed except this:
the mystery of whether she‚Äôll miss what is gone,
the wonder of if I still matter to her,
and if the spark is still there.
I can‚Äôt stop missing everything all at once.

‚∏ª

So here I am. Still loyal ‚Äî to a woman who walked away, smiling at another man.
Still grieving ‚Äî a loss only half acknowledged.
And still believing ‚Äî in something most would call foolish:
that real love doesn‚Äôt vanish because someone stops choosing it.

It lingers ‚Äî in heartbeat delays, in unsent messages rotting inside drafts folder purgatory,
in beds too wide with one pillow untouched since goodbye.
In photographs, videos, and nerve endings that fire like rapid bursts of emotion in the dead of the night.
In the absence of her once warm, inviting, and open arms.

And yes‚Ä¶ it lives in poetry written by a shattered man
trying desperately not to forget how beautiful their ruin used to feel
before everything came to a screeching halt ‚Äî left for guessing, assumptions, worries, and stress.

‚∏ª

Yet even if the love still lingers, the damage is already done.
I remain unconvinced, unknowing, and dreadfully loyal to a love I know I cannot have.

So like all other things living in this world of billions of souls,
this love too shall die someday.

1n9oght,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/1n9oght/is_kalamazoo_my_new_home/,Is Kalamazoo my new home?,"Hi! I‚Äôm a 39F moving up from Chicago and trying to figure out if Kalamazoo might be my new home.

In Chicago, some of my favorite neighborhoods I lived and worked in were Andersonville, Lincoln Square, Ravenswood, Rogers Park, Uptown, and Edgewater. I‚Äôm hoping to find something here with a similar feel. I visited a couple weekends ago and really enjoyed what I saw. I even chatted with a few small business owners/employees downtown who had nothing but great things to say about the area. I‚Äôve spent time in Holland (where one of my close friends lives) but it‚Äôs not really the right fit for me, and while I‚Äôve enjoyed visiting Grand Rapids, St. Joseph, and Saugatuck, Kalamazoo so far feels like it might be the best choice for this stage of my life. 

A little about me: I grew up in a small Midwestern town and went to college in a small Midwestern city (both in Indiana) so while I‚Äôve been in Chicago for the last 15 years, I do understand and appreciate smaller-town life. I‚Äôm really looking for that middle ground... not too quiet, but not overwhelming either. I‚Äôm also part of the LGBTQ+ community, if that makes a difference.

What I love: local shops, coffee spots, live music, thrift stores, farmers markets, hiking/biking and other outdoor adventures. I also frequent dispensaries (and I get the feeling that‚Äôs pretty common in Michigan). I‚Äôm a hairstylist, so I really thrive in artsy, welcoming, slightly offbeat communities where people are open-minded and creative.

What I‚Äôm hoping to avoid: feeling super isolated or needing to drive 30 minutes just to grab a coffee.

If you had to point me toward the Kalamazoo neighborhoods or nearby communities with the best mix of character and community, where should I start?

I am at my wits end and about to rip my hair from my scalp.,"I'm literally about to stop eating. Like Im not joking. Starvation works. Im sick of everyone pretending like it doesnt. 

Losing weight ""the right way"" has turned out to be the worst thing I've done. I swear to God. 

Backstory:

I have been losing weight for 5 years. I weighed roughly 135kgs (295 pounds) at 180cm (5'11"") Female 5 years ago. I used to be a big over eating. All the bullshit. A tale as old as I time. I wont rehash it. 

I stopped binging, started walking. But didn't do anything particularly spectacular and lost 45kg pretty consistently from 2020-2022. I still have the data logged in my phone. 

Then it stopped at 90kgs. I remember I got so frustrated at 90kgs that I gave up trying. Because I swear I was ""stuck"" here. 

And I admit, at the time I was still suffering with food noise and giving in pretty often. And so I fluctuated from 90-98kgs over 2022-2024. 

In early 2024, I said FUCK IT and started going to the gym. I hated it. It was awful. But I kept going. 5 days a week consistently throughout the rest of 2024. My diet then was still inconsistent and my weight still fluctuated but I kept going. 


And now Ive been going over 1.5 years. And its part of my routine now. I go everyday. 

Diet: 

My diet was all over the place until 3 months ago. After trying a bunch of diets over the years and eventually failing, I finally figured out the source of my food noise. And stopped it. 

I no longer order take out (I used to several times a week). I don't eat fast food ever. Processed food like chips and snacks etc all stopped. 

This is probably the most locked in period of my fucking life. I swear to God. Im not even tempted by the bullshit food. 

And for the last 3+ months Ive been without food noise. I hate measuring out food. So I decided to start buying stuff as pre-portioned as possible. So that way I can remove the annoying step of weighing it all out. 

This is how I eat (a combination of these things to equal 450-700 calories a meal)

Breakfast: 

100g chicken breast 
2 low fat string cheese 
1 cup 85g plain (no sugar) yogurt 
1 pack of nuts 20g for 106 calories

Lunch: 

200g chicken breast 
Vegetables (sometimes I fry zucchini with osyster sauce and garlic, sometimes raw cucumber or carrots. This week it was salad, so add 200 cal dressing) 
I decided to cut the salads out and switch to rice paper rolls with vegetables inside to get rid of calories from dressing. 
100g of fruit (cherries, an apple, grapes etc) 
Add string cheese or pack of nuts if I have calories left over 

Dinner:

100g of chicken breast 
100g of whatever fruit I have 
Brothy vegetables soup 100-160 calories 
Piece of bread for carbs. 

This week I switched out cheese for one boiled egg at each meal. I add a teaspoon of mustard. And half a tablespoon mayo on each half. 

When I have to eat out, I get hot pot. I put in mushroom, bok choi, cabbage, bean sprouts, rice cakes and then 100g of the meal they sell there. But I do this for dinner when I get off work maybe once a week at most. 

I will get bored and eat just my chicken on tortillas and tomato and lettuce with an apple. For lunch sometimes until i run out of ingredients.

But I keep my meals around 500-650  3 times a day. 

I used to snack all throughout the day when I was fatter. But I drink water at work and dont eat anything at work. I eat an apple on the way home to stop from buying something on the way. 

I dont cook my chicken in any oil. I heat it up in its bag and pour it on the plate. 

I drink 1 zero calories drink a day. I drink 1 shot of espresso with 150ml of milk at how 4-7 days a week with a squirt of low calorie sugar.

The only time I eat more is on my period. For the first two days I eat 2500-3k calories of higher calories food. And have successfully returned to my diet for 3 months in a row without going into a binge. 

So I consistently stay under 2k calories.I would need to be eating 2700-3k calories a day to maintain 90kg frame. And Im not. 

Exercise: 

Lifting:
5 days a week upper / lower split 1-1.5hrs. Moderate weight and reps.

Cardio:
Upper body days jogging intervals 5 run 5 walk for 20-30 mins
Lately: walk 5 min / run 20 / walk 5
Saturday-Sunday: 1 hrs on tread mill doing intervals. 

Walking: 
Currently 20k+ steps a day. Ive been walking over 10k a day for years. I dont own a car and was doing 13-15k regularly anyway. And jogging and walking my dogs pushed it to 20k. 

I exercise as much as I do because if I dont, I will become sedentary again. If I dont go to the gym on Saturday and Sunday to jog and walk, I won't get any exercise at all. 

Also, I almost never feel fatigue. I dont push myself extremely hard with weights. I lift moderately. I very rarely get DOMS. And never train to failure. I just lift until it feels easy then up the weight. 

Currently I barbell back squat 90kgs for 5. 100kgs RDL for 4, Smith machine bench 30kgs. I neglected upper body last year, so this year I'm trying. Can jog 20 minutes straight through without stopping. 

Weightloss:

I weighed 96kg in March of 2025. 

Fixed my diet in May of 2025. Got back to 90kg in June of 2025. 

And I swear my weight sticks at this number. I dont know why. Its driving me crazy. 

I weighed myself daily and it wad 90.5kg. Weekly, and it was 90.3-90.5kgs. I went to the gym every single day in July. And August. 

If I pooped, 90kgs. If I drank water and peed, 90kgs. If I was constipated, 90kgs. If I had carbs the night before, 90kgs. 

At one point I thought of buying a new scale. Changing the batteries. STILL 90.5ish kg. Not 91. Not 89. Always 90.1-90.5

I dont know what the fuck this weird equilibrium is but for me its 90kgs. But instead of giving up I decided to keep going because I knew I wasn't eating enough to be 90kgs. 

And after SIX FUCKING WEEKS, the scale dropped 2.5 kilograms on 2 days.

üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

What the FUCK is that bullshit?

No matter what I did for 6 weeks I maintained the exact same, unchanged weight with no fluctuating for 6 weeks. How is that normal?

All through August I went to the gym 31 days in a row. Did over 20k steps the last 2 weeks.

I bought a new, more expensive in-body scale, to more accurate readings. 

Today September 5th, I weighed 90.6kgs on my new scale. It says my BF is 30%. Probably inaccurate to some degree. By my BF is definitely high still. 

I have no idea where my starting BF was I cant compare. But if I had to guess it was likely over 50% 5 years ago. 

My old scale reads 91.6kgs because fuck me I guess.

üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

Im about to stop eating. Just due to mental stress. Because I just want to be 80kgs. My goal is 70kgs. 

I was 90kgs 3 years ago when I was still eating 2700 calories a day and ordering take out once a week. I was 90 kgs when I was getting a large coffee at my workplace multiple times a week. I was 90kgs when I was getting bread from a French bakery near my house 2 or 3 days a week. I was 90kgs when I wasn't exercising at all 3 years ago. 

Ive managed to get over my exercise aversion. And stop my food noise. I stopped eating out. Stopped snacking. Stopped binge eating several times a month. 

But losing 10kgs of fat is my fucking white whale..and has been for literal years. 

And I haven't eaten yet today. And after stepping on the scale, I dont have an appetite honestly. 

I have avoided the mirror for the last decade and taking photos because I hated the way I look. My elevator is a 360.mirror and I try to avoid looking everyday

I bought a floor length mirror for the first time in 10+ years. It came yesterday. My in body scale came this morning. So I made sure not to eat many carbs yesterday. I had a small roll with breakfast before the gym.

And my weight still fluctuated up another kilogram. Im gonna lose it, I swear.

I looked in the mirror and I dont look fat. I look exactly like Im just outside my normal BMI (because I am). 

I know Im probably inflamed from working out 7 days a week. Probably am carrying water weight around. From running and lifting even though I dont feel fatigue from it.

I know Im not over 90kg. Because I have a pair of pants I can only fit when Im 90kg. And they've gone very  loose in the waist. So Im definitely 88kgs or less. My new pants that I bought 2 months ago. A size smaller, have also gotten looser. 

But I just want to see the shit reflected on the scale. Consistently. And I dont. It seems like consistently scale movement is the norm for most people. 

It has never been for me. When I was fatter and sedentary, it moved on a two week basis, if I was lucky. 

Now its gone to monthly. And I'm walking around with a bunch of water retention. And I'm sick of it. 

I see posts everywhere of people consistently losing weight on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. If their weight really gets ""stuck"" maybe a 3 weeks to a month. 

But 6 weeks is sending me over the fucking deep end. That seems like an unreasonable amount of time to maintain the same weight. And Im very close to just giving up again. 

I feel like I try too hard to still be fat. I look at my exercise stats and its crazy how much effort I put in for my body to still be swinging back up to the 90s. I dont have enough calories in my house to be swinging back to the 90s. I dont enough food on my plate to still be swinging back into the 90s.
 
I've tried to make short cuts with diet by only eating stuff already portioned out so I could reduce my mistakes in measuring error. 

But thats not working either. 

So the way I see it, not eating is the only way to ensure 100% that it cant be from calories. 

I give up.

1n9odec,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1n9odec/where_to_go_from_here/,Where to go from here?,"I just learned that my ex-partner cheated on me back when I was pregnant and now they are together. 

I really need to get this out of my chest. Because lately I‚Äôve been feeling so depressed. 

I (25F) is now a single mother because my ex (27M) cheated on me while I was 5 months pregnant and he chooses her our me and my baby. 

For context: TW mention of Violence 

Me and my ex have been together for 3 years, we‚Äôre not married even though we have a child but we are planning to be married next year. 

He was the most gentle person I‚Äôve met, and even when I got pregnant he was happy and even gave me the decision if I want to keep the baby or not. I told him I want to keep it since I saw how happy he was. 

All of the abuse started when he met his co-worker (25F), let‚Äôs call her Rach for the sake of the story. At that time Rach has a boyfriend (26M) and is planning to get married too. But Rach and her bf are having a lot of problems regarding their sexual life, how did I know this? Because he keeps on venting it out on my then partner. 

I didn‚Äôt think much of it since I trusted him with all my heart, big mistake btw. Slowly they are becoming so close and their other colleagues are saying they are ‚Äúwork husband/work wife‚Äù something like that. 

On my 5th month of pregnancy I saw a message from the girl saying she is great in bed and my husband should take home her underwear, I was furious. I ask and confronted my husband regarding that, he simply said Rach was just ‚Äújoking‚Äù and didn‚Äôt mean it. When I get his phone back and tried to screenshot the convo it was already deleted so I didn‚Äôt know what he replied to it. 

Ever since that conversation with him, he grew cold and didn‚Äôt seem to be interested with my pregnancy, mind you I was also working but he didn‚Äôt contribute to anything because he said he wants to save until the baby arrives. 

At this time he always yells at me, blame me because we can‚Äôt do the deed. 

Fast forward when I delivered my baby, I saw they were still messaging each other and at that time I didn‚Äôt say anything because I‚Äôm scared to get yelled at again. (And I won‚Äôt detail how he SA‚Äôd me)

Here is when I left, my baby was 4 months old and crying because he is hungry and he yelled at her saying ‚ÄúYou ruined my life stop crying you bitch‚Äù I tried to stop him but he throw his phone at me. I told him we‚Äôre leaving and he said ‚ÄúGood, finally‚Äù 

After that he keeps messaging me telling me he was sorry and he just lost control of his emotions. I didn‚Äôt respond because I don‚Äôt want a life like that for my girl. 

Recently I was told that they always saw them (he and rach) at some coffee shops dating and flexing each other. I didn‚Äôt know how to feel, I feel like shit now. How can they be happy with what they did?

The truth is, I feel lonely. I‚Äôm naturally introverted, and while I‚Äôve always been comfortable keeping to myself, lately I‚Äôve realized how much I miss simply sharing time with another person. Not in a high-pressure ‚Äúdate‚Äù sense, but in a softer, lower-stakes way.

I just bought an ultrasonic pod cleaner. Do they really work? How often does bacteria build up to the point i need to clean it?

1n9o2o5,https://youtu.be/xH8pXr5_WiE,3 Very Scary TRUE Remote Research Station Horror Stories,"# ""Winter Silence"":

I had been at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station for months when things started to go wrong. My job involved monitoring telescopes, collecting data on stars that no one else could see from anywhere but here. The team was small that winter, just fifty of us locked in by the cold, with no planes coming or going until spring. Rodney was one of the astrophysicists, a guy from Australia with a quick laugh and a habit of sharing his home-brewed beer after shifts. He handled the big scopes, always tinkering with equipment in the dark sector.

One evening, as I finished logging readings in the main lab, Rodney walked in looking off. His face was pale under the fluorescent lights, and he rubbed his eyes like something burned them. ""Hey, mate,"" he said, his voice rough. ""You got any aspirin? Feels like my head's splitting.""

I handed him a bottle from the drawer. ""Rough day? Those scopes giving you trouble again?""

He swallowed a couple pills dry. ""Nah, just tired. Been staring at screens too long. Vision's blurry, and my chest feels tight. Probably nothing."" He forced a grin and headed back to his quarters. I watched him go, figuring it was the usual cabin fever. We all got it down here‚Äîaches from the dry air, moods swinging from the endless routine.

The next morning, during breakfast in the galley, Rodney didn't show. I grabbed a tray and went to check on him. His room was dim, curtains drawn. He sat on his bunk, hunched over, breathing hard. ""Can't catch my breath,"" he muttered. ""And my stomach‚Äîit's killing me.""

I helped him up. ""Let's get you to Doc Thompson. No messing around.""

We walked slow to the medical bay. Rodney leaned on me, his steps unsteady. Thompson, our station doctor, was there sorting supplies. He was a quiet man, ex-military, always calm. ""What's going on?"" he asked, motioning Rodney to sit.

Rodney explained his symptoms‚Äîthe blurred vision, the pain in his joints now too, like fire in his bones. Thompson checked his vitals, shone a light in his eyes. ""Could be altitude sickness catching up, or maybe an infection. I'll run some tests.""

I waited outside while Thompson examined him. When Rodney came out, he looked no better. ""Gave me some meds,"" he said. ""Said to rest. But I feel worse.""

""Take it easy then. I'll cover your shift if needed.""

He nodded, but his eyes darted around, uneasy. ""Thanks. Just... keep an eye out, yeah? This place gets to people sometimes.""

I didn't think much of it then. But that afternoon, during a team meeting in the lounge, whispers started. Karen, our biologist, pulled me aside. She was sharp-eyed, always noticing details. ""Rodney looked bad this morning. You think it's something in the air? We had that CO leak last month.""

""Nah, Doc's on it,"" I replied. But doubt crept in. The station was old, pipes and vents everywhere. What if something toxic had seeped in?

By evening, Rodney was back in medical, worse. I stopped by after dinner. He lay on the exam table, sweating, his face twisted in pain. ""It's my eyes,"" he gasped. ""Can't stand the light. And I'm throwing up blood now.""

Thompson was there, injecting something into his arm. ""This should calm you down,"" the doc said. ""It's an antipsychotic‚Äîmight help with the agitation.""

Rodney grabbed my sleeve. ""Don't leave me here alone. Something's wrong. I didn't drink anything weird, but... feels like poison.""

His words hit hard. Poison? In this frozen nowhere? I stayed, holding his hand as he rambled. ""Remember that argument with Paul last week? Over the equipment budget. He was mad, said I'd regret it.""

Paul was our engineer, a burly guy with a short temper. They'd clashed, sure, but nothing serious. Or was it?

Thompson stepped out to grab more supplies. Rodney's breathing grew ragged. ""Promise me,"" he whispered. ""If I don't make it, check my stuff. My flask‚ÄîI always use it for water. Someone might have...""

He trailed off as Thompson returned. I left feeling unsettled, the hallway lights buzzing too loud in the quiet base.

That night, sleep wouldn't come. I lay in my bunk, staring at the ceiling, replaying Rodney's words. The station creaked around me, metal contracting in the extreme temperatures outside. What if someone had tampered with his things? We all shared spaces‚Äîthe galley, the labs. Easy to slip something in.

Next morning, alarms blared. I rushed to medical. A crowd gathered: Karen, Paul, a few others. Thompson knelt over Rodney, doing CPR. ""He's in cardiac arrest,"" the doc shouted. ""Get the defibrillator!""

We worked for what felt like hours‚Äîshocks, compressions. Rodney's body jerked, but no response. Finally, Thompson stopped, wiped his brow. ""Time of death: 6:45 p.m. yesterday? No, wait‚Äîit's past midnight now. He's gone.""

Gasps rippled through the group. Karen covered her mouth. ""What happened? He was fine two days ago.""

Thompson shook his head. ""Natural causes, probably. Heart gave out.""

But Rodney's last words echoed in my mind. I pulled Thompson aside later. ""He mentioned poison. Said to check his flask.""

The doc's eyes narrowed. ""Delirium from the illness. But I'll note it.""

I couldn't let it go. That afternoon, I slipped into Rodney's room while others ate. His flask sat on the desk, half-full. I sniffed it‚Äîodorless. But methanol, I recalled from safety training, was hard to detect. It was everywhere in the labs, for cleaning gear.

Paul walked in unexpected. ""What are you doing here?"" he asked, voice low.

""Just... collecting his notes for the report."" My hands shook as I pocketed the flask.

He stared. ""Rodney was a good guy. Shame."" But his tone felt flat, eyes avoiding mine.

Suspicion grew. In the days after, the base felt different. People avoided each other in the halls. At dinner, Karen whispered to me, ""Thompson didn't use the blood analyzer on Rodney. I heard him say the battery was dead. But I saw him charge it last week.""

""Why wouldn't he?"" I asked.

She shrugged. ""Maybe he missed something. Or... didn't want to find it.""

I tested the flask myself in the lab, late at night. No fancy equipment, just basic chem strips. The reading showed traces of something off‚Äînot water. My pulse raced. If it was methanol, how did it get there?

I confronted Paul in the workshop. ""Rodney thought someone messed with his stuff. You two fought recently.""

Paul set down his tools, face reddening. ""You accusing me? He was reckless with gear, that's all. If he drank the wrong thing, that's on him.""

""But he didn't drink alcohol like that. He brewed beer, sure, but methanol?""

Paul leaned close. ""Watch yourself. We're stuck here months more. Accidents happen.""

His words lingered, a threat hanging in the air. I started locking my door, checking my food. Nights blurred into days under the artificial lights. Whispers spread‚Äîrumors of past grudges, hidden resentments bubbling up in isolation.

One evening, in the lounge, a group gathered: me, Karen, Thompson, and a few techs. Tension thickened as we discussed Rodney. ""We need to radio Christchurch,"" I said. ""Report this properly.""

Thompson sighed. ""Lines are spotty. And NSF says wait for evac. No point stirring panic.""

Karen spoke up. ""But if it's poison, one of us did it. We can't just sit here.""

Eyes shifted, no one meeting gazes. Paul wasn't there, but his absence felt ominous.

Later, alone in my quarters, I heard footsteps outside my door‚Äîslow, deliberate. They paused, then moved on. I gripped my pillow, mind racing. Who? Why Rodney?

Weeks dragged. We buried him in a snow trench, waiting for the body to fly out. Investigations loomed, but down here, we were our own law. I watched everyone: Thompson's calm demeanor, now suspicious; Karen's questions, maybe covering her tracks; Paulavoiding me altogether.

One night, I found a note under my door: ""Stop digging. Or you're next.""

Fear gripped me constant. Every sip of water, every bite, I wondered. The base, once a haven of science, became a trap. Trapped with a killer, or killers, among friends turned strangers.

When planes finally came in October, they took Rodney's body. Autopsy confirmed methanol poisoning. But how? Accident? Suicide? Murder? Questions lingered, answers none.

I left that season, but the fear followed. In quiet moments, I wonder who walked those halls with poison in hand. And if they watch me still.





# ""The Last Page"":

I had been at Bellingshausen Station for six months when things started to change between Sergey and Oleg. My name is Anna, and I work as a biologist here, studying ice core samples to understand past climates. The station sits on King George Island, far from everything, with just a small group of us‚Äîscientists and support staff‚Äîkeeping the place running. We all knew each other well by then, sharing meals, chores, and the endless routine of data collection. Sergey was the engineer, always fixing equipment with his steady hands, and Oleg handled welding and repairs, quick with tools but even quicker with his words.

At first, the two men got along fine. Sergey liked to read in his bunk after shifts, burying himself in old novels from the station's library. He would pick classics, like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy, savoring each page slowly. Oleg, on the other hand, devoured books faster than anyone. He finished one every few days and loved talking about them. ""Anna,"" he would say to me over coffee in the canteen, ""have you read that one about the brothers? The ending will surprise you."" I nodded politely, but I noticed Sergey often stayed quiet during those chats, his eyes fixed on his mug.

One evening, after a long day calibrating sensors, we all gathered for dinner. The canteen smelled of boiled potatoes and canned stew, the same meal we rotated through. Sergey sat across from me, flipping through a worn copy of a mystery novel. Oleg plopped down next to him, grinning. ""Hey, Sergey, I saw you with that book. Good choice. But wait until you get to the part where the detective finds out the killer is his own‚Äî""

""Stop,"" Sergey interrupted, his voice low but firm. He closed the book with a snap. ""I haven't finished it yet. Don't ruin it.""

Oleg laughed it off. ""Come on, it's just a story. Besides, the twist is brilliant. You'll see why when‚Äî""

""I said stop."" Sergey's face tightened, his knuckles white around the book's spine. The rest of us‚Äîme, the station doctor Elena, and the cook Viktor‚Äîexchanged glances. It wasn't like Sergey to snap. He usually kept to himself, polite and methodical.

Oleg shrugged. ""Fine, fine. Keep your secrets."" But he winked at me across the table, as if it was all in fun.

That was the first crack I noticed. Over the next weeks, it got worse. The station's isolation pressed in on us, with no flights out until the supply plane came in a month. We relied on radio for contact with the outside world, but signals were spotty. Books became our escape, the library our only library. Sergey borrowed more volumes, stacking them by his bed. Oleg kept speeding through them, and he couldn't resist dropping hints.

One afternoon, I found Sergey alone in the lab, staring at a blank screen. ""Everything okay?"" I asked, setting down my samples.

He rubbed his eyes. ""Oleg again. He told me the end of another one last night. Why does he do that? It's like he enjoys taking the surprise away.""

I tried to lighten it. ""Maybe he's just excited. Talk to him about it.""

Sergey shook his head. ""I've tried. He laughs it off. But those stories... they're all I have here to unwind. Without the endings being mine to discover, what's left?""

I didn't know what to say. Later that day, I pulled Oleg aside in the hallway. ""Ease up on Sergey with the book talk. It's bothering him.""

Oleg rolled his eyes. ""He's too sensitive. It's harmless. Besides, Anna, you should read faster if you want to join the discussions.""

His casual tone made me uneasy, but I let it go. We all had our ways of coping with the confinement.

As days passed, Sergey's mood darkened. He started eating alone, skipping group meals. I heard him muttering to himself in the corridors, pacing late into the night. The station's lights hummed constantly, and the sound of his footsteps echoed through the metal walls. One time, I woke up to it‚Äîstep, step, pause‚Äîright outside my door. I lay there, listening, wondering if he was okay.

Elena, the doctor, noticed too. During a routine check-up, she confided in me. ""Sergey's blood pressure is up. He says he's not sleeping well. I asked if something's wrong, and he mentioned arguments with Oleg.""

""Over books?"" I asked.

She nodded. ""Seems trivial, but in a place like this, small things build up. Isolation can twist the mind.""

That night, over cards in the common room, tension boiled over. Viktor dealt the hands, and we played quietly at first. Oleg won a round and slapped his cards down. ""Like that book Sergey lent me‚Äîthe hero always wins in the end, right? Or does he?""

Sergey stood up suddenly, his chair scraping back. ""Enough, Oleg. You do this on purpose.""

Oleg leaned back, smirking. ""What? It's a joke. Sit down.""

""No. You spoil everything. Every single one. Why? To make me miserable?""

The room went still. Viktor cleared his throat. ""Guys, let's calm down.""

But Sergey pointed at Oleg. ""You think it's funny? In this frozen hole, those books are my only break from the boredom. And you take that away, piece by piece.""

Oleg's smile faded. ""You're overreacting. It's just words.""

Sergey stormed out, slamming the door. Elena looked at me. ""We need to watch this. It could get bad.""

I agreed, but what could we do? The next supply flight was weeks away, and the radio couldn't summon help overnight.

A few days later, I caught Sergey in the library, rearranging shelves. His eyes were red-rimmed. ""Anna, stay away from Oleg. He's not right.""

""What do you mean?"" I asked, my voice steady.

""He watches me. Whispers spoilers when he thinks I'm not listening. Last night, he slipped a note under my door with the end of my current read.""

I doubted it, but Sergey's paranoia scared me. ""Show me the note.""

He pulled a crumpled paper from his pocket. Scrawled in pencil: ""The butler did it. Sweet dreams.""

Oleg's handwriting. My skin prickled. ""This isn't funny anymore.""

That evening, I confronted Oleg in the workshop. He was welding a pipe, sparks flying. ""Why the note? You're pushing him too far.""

He shut off the torch and lifted his mask. ""To mess with him. He takes himself too seriously. Lighten up, Anna.""

""It's not a game. Stop before something happens.""

He chuckled. ""What, you think he'll snap? Over books?""

His dismissiveness chilled me. That night, I couldn't sleep, imagining worst-case scenarios in our sealed world.

The following week, Sergey isolated himself more. He skipped shifts, claiming illness. Elena checked on him, but he waved her off. ""Just tired,"" he said.

Then came the alcohol. We had a small stash for special occasions, but someone started dipping into it. Bottles went missing. Viktor accused Oleg, who denied it. ""Maybe Sergey's drowning his sorrows.""

One morning, I found an empty vodka bottle in the trash, fingerprints smudged. Suspicion grew.

The breaking point hit on a Tuesday. We were in the canteen for lunch‚Äîstew again. Sergey entered late, his face pale. He sat far from Oleg, but Oleg called out. ""Hey, finished that thriller yet? The killer's the one you least expect‚Äîthe‚Äî""

Sergey lunged across the table, grabbing Oleg by the collar. ""Shut your mouth!""

Viktor pulled them apart. ""Enough! Both of you!""

Sergey backed off, breathing hard. ""One more word, and I swear...""

Elena stepped in. ""Sergey, come with me. Let's talk.""

He followed her out, but his glare at Oleg lingered.

That afternoon, the radio crackled with static‚Äîno clear signal. We were truly cut off.

By evening, things seemed calmer. We ate quietly. Sergey apologized. ""Sorry for earlier. Won't happen again.""

Oleg nodded. ""Water under the bridge.""

But as we cleared plates, Oleg leaned toward Sergey. ""Just one thing‚Äîthat book? The hero dies alone.""

Sergey's eyes widened. He grabbed a kitchen knife from the counter, the one we used for cutting bread. ""You... you won't stop.""

Before anyone could react, he plunged it into Oleg's chest. Blood spread across Oleg's shirt. He gasped, clutching the wound. ""What... Sergey...""

I screamed, backing away. Viktor tackled Sergey, pinning him down. Elena rushed to Oleg, pressing a cloth to the stab. ""Hold on! We need to stabilize him!""

Sergey didn't resist, his face blank. ""He took everything from me. Every ending.""

We radioed for help, but the signal was weak. It took hours to connect. Medevac came two days later, airlifting Oleg to Chile. He survived, barely.

Sergey was confined until authorities arrived. He sat in his room, staring at unfinished books.

Even now, back home, I can't pick up a novel without checking who's around. In that station, small irritations became deadly. And with no way out, anyone could break.





# ""Outpost Unit 3"":

I arrived at the remote station feeling full of purpose. I had trained for months for this mission. Inside the little base, I found Jenna and Lucas already busy. We were a team of three: a geologist, an engineer, and me, the communications specialist. Everything seemed normal as we greeted each other and brewed coffee.

Jenna smiled when I stepped into the kitchen. Lucas carried a tray of steaming mugs. He set one beside me and said, ‚ÄúMorning scans are clear, no issues reported.‚Äù I took a sip and replied, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good. Any word from Cape Town?‚Äù He shook his head. ‚ÄúNothing, just radio silence since the supply ship left. Should be normal though.‚Äù Jenna chimed in, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll manage. Just the three of us.‚Äù We joked about the endless sunlight and how silly it would be to get homesick at the South Pole. It felt comforting to have a routine in this isolated place.

Lucas asked, ‚ÄúDid anyone notice that the power gauge dipped last night?‚Äù I frowned. Jenna pulled up a screen. ‚ÄúYes, I saw it. The geothermal sensor reading dropped suddenly.‚Äù Lucas leaned in, tapping his clipboard. ‚ÄúInterference or power glitch,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNo big deal, we have backup.‚Äù Jenna sighed and nodded. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis station is built for survival. Trust the design.‚Äù I forced a smile and agreed, but a small worry knotted in my gut.

We finished our midday checks and I prepared to test the radio dish outside. Lucas locked the hatch behind us and we stepped into a bright glare. I adjusted the antenna, squinting at the whiteness. Behind me, Lucas and Jenna bundled up and headed back to the lab. I muttered to myself, ‚ÄúI hope I never get bored of this view.‚Äù Jenna heard and laughed, saying, ‚ÄúFocus, we‚Äôre relying on you to keep us connected.‚Äù I smiled. ‚ÄúEverything will be fine,‚Äù I assured her.

Back inside, Jenna worked on the sensor logs while Lucas typed notes into his clipboard. ‚ÄúNo significant problems,‚Äù he said, reading his notes. ‚ÄúTrust me, this station is built for survival. We‚Äôre prepared for things like this.‚Äù Jenna nodded slowly but still looked uncertain. I patted Lucas on the shoulder. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs right,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThis place was designed for long winters.‚Äù We tried to move on, but the silence felt heavier than before.

Night came and the station grew quiet. I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Around midnight I heard Jenna‚Äôs footsteps echoing down the hall. Curious, I got up and followed. I found her fiddling with her handheld radio near the comms desk, pressing buttons into the static. She spoke softly, ‚ÄúLucas, can you hear me?‚Äù The reply crackled: ‚ÄúJenna, I‚Äôm here. What‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù Jenna whispered, ‚ÄúYou told me to leave if something happened. I‚Äôm scared.‚Äù Suddenly the line went dead. Jenna‚Äôs eyes met mine from behind the crate. She mouthed, ‚ÄúHe said I should leave.‚Äù A chill ran through me. I placed a hand on Jenna‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I said quietly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll sort this out.‚Äù

Silence followed in the corridor. I stepped out. Jenna looked at me. ‚ÄúHe said I had to get out of here. If I don't, something bad will happen,‚Äù she mouthed urgently. My throat tightened. We stood in the dim hallway together for a moment. Finally I led her back to our bunks, but neither of us rested that night.

The next morning, Lucas was missing. We searched the hall, the lab, and even outside. I called out, ‚ÄúLucas!‚Äù in empty rooms. Jenna trembled at every echo. In the kitchen, I discovered a smear of blood on the floor leading out the side hatch. My breath caught. ‚ÄúLucas?‚Äù I whispered. Jenna crouched by the blood. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs real blood,‚Äù she said, panic in her voice. I grabbed the radio handset and tried a channel. Only silence answered. My hands shook. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs hurt,‚Äù I said. Jenna nodded, her face pale. ‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù she asked. I didn‚Äôt know.

By noon we argued. I said, ‚ÄúHe couldn't have just disappeared. We have emergency supplies if needed.‚Äù Jenna clenched her fist. ‚ÄúWe should have called for help!‚Äù I shook my head. ‚ÄúThere's no way until we fix the radio.‚Äù She bit her lip and nodded. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. I just... I can‚Äôt believe this is happening.‚Äù I put my hand on her shoulder. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll figure this out together,‚Äù I said firmly.

I grabbed a heavy wrench from the workshop. ‚ÄúThis will do, I guess,‚Äù I murmured. Jenna took a spare recorder. Suddenly the radio hissed, playing Lucas‚Äôs voice: ‚ÄúStay back or I shoot.‚Äù My heart froze. Jenna gasped, ‚ÄúHe said that? Are you sure?‚Äù I nodded slowly. We both backed into the hallway, wrench and recorder raised. Jenna whispered, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not himself.‚Äù The anger in his voice was not my friend‚Äôs.

Footsteps pounded outside the lab. Jenna gripped my arm. Lucas burst in, knife in hand, his clothes torn and eyes wild. He yelled, ‚ÄúI saw you. I know you‚Äôre lying to me!‚Äù He lunged. I swung the wrench, hitting his arm. He yelped and stumbled. Jenna threw a chair into his path. We scrambled toward the communications room. He chased us, screaming incoherently. I locked the heavy door behind us. The crash of his blows echoed through the metal as he tried to break in.

Safely locked in, we both trembled. Jenna whispered, ‚ÄúHe shot at me.‚Äù I felt sick hearing it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay now. He‚Äôs behind that door,‚Äù I said quietly. Jenna sank to the floor, shaking. ‚ÄúWhat do we do now?‚Äù she murmured. I backed against the wall. ‚ÄúWe stay calm. No one can reach us until we call for help. We just wait and hope for dawn.‚Äù Jenna nodded slowly. We sat in silence, listening for any sound outside.

We huddled together through the night, using the radio only to listen. Each time footsteps creaked outside the door, we held our breath. I wanted to sleep, but every small noise startled me. Jenna murmured prayers. The hours dragged. Finally, in the early morning, I heard nothing. The station was eerily silent except for the low hum of the generator.

At dawn, we crept out. The station corridors were empty and silent. I raced to the radio and activated the emergency distress signal. My voice cracked as I announced, ‚ÄúThis is Outpost Unit 3. We have an intruder. We need immediate help.‚Äù Static answered. I repeated myself into the mic. Jenna shook her head. ‚ÄúNo one can hear us yet,‚Äù I said.

We gathered our gear and left the station through the side hatch. The snow crunched under our boots. Jenna looked at me, eyes wide. I answered her unspoken question, voice trembling: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gone. We are safe now.‚Äù

We set off across the ice sheet, pulling a sled with our supplies. The sun was rising, but it gave little warmth. I felt hollow as we walked. Behind us, the station stood small and quiet. A few times I shouted into the white emptiness, ‚ÄúHello? Hello?‚Äù Only the wind answered. Jenna kept moving forward, determined. Hours later, we reached the emergency shelter. Inside was another radio. I set it up and spoke: ‚ÄúOutpost Unit 3 survived. Requesting immediate evacuation.‚Äù The radio crackled to life. Relief washed over me.

Eventually a rescue helicopter arrived on the horizon. As we climbed aboard, I didn‚Äôt look back, but I felt the weight of what happened still lingering. Jenna and I said little. We would heal physically, but neither of us would ever feel completely safe in the stillness of the dark again. In the quiet of a hospital bed, I replay Lucas‚Äôs voice in my head. His face, once friendly, haunted me. Even now, across the vast silence of the ice, I can‚Äôt shake the memory that somewhere out there, in the white cold, danger still lurks.",1,1757125612.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Help with a link..thanks in advance

Title on FB:  My Boss,My baby daddy,characters Jocelyn and Zayden Wolfe and daughter Mia.

Her POV: Seven years ago, I had a one-night stand at a masquerade gala with a stranger I never thought I‚Äôd see again üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è. Then I found out I was pregnant‚Ä¶ and raised our daughter alone üíî. Now, that man? He‚Äôs my new boss‚ÄîZayden Wolfe. A ruthless billionaire with no memory of me, no idea he has a child, and no clue I‚Äôm the woman he‚Äôs been searching for üî•. I should‚Äôve told him the truth the moment I saw his face‚Ä¶ but I couldn‚Äôt. Not until our daughter‚Äôs life was on the line. And now? There‚Äôs no hiding anymore ü´£‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•.  Chapter 1  POV Jocelyn  ‚ÄúShit, shit, SHIT‚Äî‚Äù The words tear from my throat like a battle cry. My heel catches the elevator threshold like it‚Äôs personally offended by my existence. I‚Äôm airborne for exactly two seconds. Papers explode from my death grip like the world‚Äôs saddest confetti. My coffee launches across pristine marble flooring that probably costs more per square foot than I make in a month. My dignity? Already dead and buried six feet under. I hit that floor like a meteor strike, and somewhere in the distance, I swear I hear the universe laughing. ‚ÄúSmooth, Jocelyn. Real fucking smooth.‚Äù I‚Äôm scrambling on hands and knees, chasing scattered documents across marble that‚Äôs so polished I can see my own mortified expression reflected back at me. This is it. This is how I lose the only job that could save Mia‚Äôs life‚Äîface-first on the 43rd floor of some corporate palace that screams money and intimidation from every surface. ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, are you‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine!‚Äù The words snap out harder than I intended, but panic makes me sharp-edged. The secretary behind the massive desk looks like she‚Äôd rather call security than acknowledge my existence. Her nameplate gleams in gold letters: Patricia. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ me versus physics. Physics won, I guess.‚Äù I‚Äôm hauling myself upright, while my hands won‚Äôt stop shaking, and it has nothing to do with the fall. Twenty-six hours at the hospital watching your six-year-old fight cancer will do that to you. Sleep becomes optional when your kid‚Äôs life hangs in the balance. Patricia‚Äôs mouth twists like she‚Äôs tasting something particularly unpleasant. ‚ÄúMr. Wolfe doesn‚Äôt tolerate‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúDisruptions. Crystal clear.‚Äù I straighten up, trying to look like a functioning adult instead of a tornado survivor. The mantra starts looping in my head like a broken record: ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt mess this up, Jocelyn. You can‚Äôt afford to.‚Äô Triple salary. The words dance in my vision like a mirage. Enough for Mia‚Äôs treatment. Enough for the experimental therapy her doctors mentioned in hushed tones. Enough to maybe‚Äîmaybe‚Äîkeep my baby alive and healthy. If I don‚Äôt faceplant again in the next five minutes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the new assistant?‚Äù Patricia‚Äôs voice could freeze hell over and charge admission. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me. Professional disaster, at your service.‚Äù The sarcasm slips out before I can stop it, but I‚Äôm past caring. A door slams behind Patricia‚Äôs desk, and the sound ricochets through the space like a gunshot. Then he walks out, like he owns the world. Broad shoulders that strain against a charcoal suit, sleeves rolled up to reveal forearms that should be illegal. Hair that‚Äôs somewhere between gold and ash, perfectly tousled in that way that takes either professional styling or incredible genetics. Phone pressed to his ear, voice cutting through the air like a blade: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a damn what Shanghai thinks. Fire them. All of them. I want new contractors by morning.‚Äù Then he turns and those eyes hit me like a freight train carrying a cargo load of holy shit. Green like sea surface, like emeralds, like every clich√© poets use when they‚Äôre trying to describe something indescribable. They‚Äôre sharp enough to cut glass and focused enough to dissect my soul in under three seconds. Jesus Christ, he's beautiful in that dangerous, untouchable way that makes smart girls do monumentally stupid things. There's something about him. Something that pulls at the edges of my memory like a half-forgotten dream. I know this face or maybe I've imagined it a thousand times. The way he carries himself, that particular tilt of his head, even his presence feels achingly familiar. The recognition hits like d√©j√† vu mixed with pure, undiluted want. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late.‚Äù He ends his call with military precision, sliding the phone into his pocket without breaking eye contact. ‚ÄúSorry, traffic was‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want excuses. I want results and discipline.‚Äù His voice hits different. Low, commanding, with an undertone that sends weird shivers down my spine for reasons I absolutely cannot and will not analyze right now. ‚ÄúRight. Results and discipline. Got it.‚Äù My own voice sounds foreign, breathless in a way that makes me want to kick myself. He‚Äôs already moving, all purpose and controlled energy. ‚ÄúConference room. Cunningham files. Twenty minutes.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhich Cunningham files?‚Äù He stops. Pivots. Those green eyes narrow to laser points that could probably bore holes through steel. ‚ÄúThe ones you should have reviewed instead of whatever kept you looking like you went ten rounds with a blender and lost spectacularly.‚Äù Ouch. Direct hit to the ego. ‚ÄúI was at the hospital‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúPersonal problems stay personal. This is business.‚Äù Cold bastard. Beautiful, intimidating, completely heartless bastard. The next eight hours are psychological torture disguised as employment. Every order delivered like I‚Äôm an incompetent child who can‚Äôt be trusted with safety scissors. He criticizes my filing system, my coffee-making skills, my ability to transfer calls without hanging up on people. Nothing I do meets his standards, which apparently exist somewhere in the stratosphere. But I need this job. Mia needs this job. So I swallow my pride, along with several creative profanities, and do whatever Zayden Wolfe demands. Even when my body keeps freaking out around him. Something about him sets my nerves on fire, but I can‚Äôt figure out why. Maybe it‚Äôs just intimidation. Rich, powerful men have that effect, right? The whole alpha predator thing that makes normal humans want to either flee or submit. Basic biology. Except it doesn‚Äôt feel basic. It feels complicated and messy and terrifying. At exactly five o‚Äôclock, I bolt from that building like it‚Äôs on fire and I‚Äôm the last person to notice. Straight to the hospital. Straight to Mia. Straight to the only thing that matters. She‚Äôs awake when I slip into her room, dark curls spread across the pillow like a halo. Those huge light-green eyes, that came from someone I try very hard not to think about, light up when she sees me. ‚ÄúMama! Look what I drew!‚Äù Another tiger. Always tigers. This one is orange and black, with fierce eyes and powerful paws. She‚Äôs been drawing them for months now, ever since she started the new treatment. Tigers in every possible configuration‚Äîsleeping tigers, prowling tigers, tigers with cubs. ‚ÄúWhy tigers, baby?‚Äù She considers this with the seriousness that only six-year-olds can muster. ‚ÄúBecause they‚Äôre brave and strong. Like my daddy would be if I had one.‚Äù My heart cracks clean in half. ‚ÄúMia, sweetheart‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI know I don‚Äôt have a daddy. That‚Äôs okay, Mama. But sometimes I pretend he‚Äôd be like a tiger. Powerful and protective. He‚Äôd fight the bad things and keep us safe.‚Äù My hand moves to the birthmark on my collarbone without conscious thought. Hidden beneath my collar, where no one can see, that heart-shapet spot that‚Äôs been there since birth. Seven years ago. A masquerade gala I had no desire to attend at first. Champagne and masks and a stranger who made me feel alive in ways I didn‚Äôt know were possible. Eyes that burned like fire. Hands that worshipped every inch of my skin like I was something precious. A voice that whispered praises like a prayer while he traced that birthmark with his tongue, calling it a lucky charm. I ran before he could wake. Before I could fall harder. Before I could tell him he‚Äôd changed my life forever in ways he‚Äôd never know. Somewhere in this city, that stranger is living his life‚Äîsuccessful, powerful, probably married with a perfect family‚Äîwhile his daughter draws tigers and dreams of having a father strong enough to save her. He has no idea she exists. No idea she‚Äôs fighting for her life. No idea that every day she slips a little further away while he makes million-dollar deals and lives his perfect life. The stranger who gave me the most beautiful thing in my world. The stranger who never knew he had a daughter.  Chapter 2   POV Jocelyn ‚ÄúI can do this. I can fucking do this.‚Äù Day three at Wolfe Tower and I already look like death warmed over in a microwave that's been broken since 2019. My reflection in the elevator doors: a woman losing a cage match with corporate America. My inbox is a digital nightmare: 347 unread emails since yesterday evening. Each one marked with varying degrees of urgency that range from ‚Äúmildly important‚Äù to ‚Äúthe building is literally on fire.‚Äù My eyes are bloodshot from staring at Mr. Wolfe's cryptic spreadsheets until 2 AM, trying to decode notes that might as well be hieroglyphics. But here's the thing keeping me vertical: I'm still here. Still breathing. Still employed. Still getting paid while my daughter fights for her life twenty blocks away. Patricia doesn't look up when I stumble past her pristine desk like a caffeine-powered zombie. ""Still here? Thought you'd be gone after Day One."" The words hit like a casual slap designed to look accidental. ‚ÄúSurprise. Sorry to disappoint, I‚Äôm annoyingly hard to kill.‚Äù She finally glances up, lips curling into that familiar sneer that I‚Äôm starting to recognize as her default expression. Like she‚Äôs perpetually smelling something unpleasant, and that something is me. ""We'll see."" Before I can tell her exactly where to shove her attitude, Mr. Wolfe's door creaks open like a horror movie sound effect. ""Ms. Hartwell."" Two words. Just two fucking words, and my entire nervous system goes DEFCON 1. My spine snaps straight, shoulders tense, every muscle preparing for fresh hell. ""My calendar's been misaligned since Singapore. Correct it. Then brief me on the Johnson account. Ten minutes."" Door slams. I'm staring at expensive wood grain while my brain processes the impossibility. Ten minutes to fix a calendar that looks like a jigsaw puzzle made of chaos and time zones that shouldn't exist. Brief him on Johnson‚Äîwhich involves either a merger, hostile takeover, or both simultaneously. Mind-reading apparently comes standard with my job description. ‚ÄúFantastic,‚Äù I mutter, speed-walking to my desk—é. ‚ÄúJust fucking fantastic.‚Äù By noon, I‚Äôm pretty sure my soul has vacated the premises. Probably in the Caribbean drinking fruity cocktails and laughing at my life choices. Twelve-page report compiled from sources that didn't exist until I created them? Check. Lunch meeting cancelled five minutes after confirmation, requiring apology calls to three executives who think I'm clinically insane? Check. Presentation reorganized for a client that materialized like corporate magic? Double check with existential crisis. Then comes the executive luncheon. Crown jewel of corporate torture. I'm balancing espresso shots like I'm defusing a bomb‚Äîwhich, given the collective net worth in this room, I basically am. Hands shaking from exhaustion, three energy drinks that were definitely a mistake, and constant low-level panic that's become my baseline emotional state. A boardroom full of men in suits costing more than my entire existence. They're discussing quarterly projections with the casual intensity of people planning world domination. Almost to the conference table when Patricia appears like a corporate ninja. Her shoulder bumps mine with precision screaming ""accident"" while being anything but. ""Oops."" The word drips fake innocence. Tray tilts. Time slows to that special catastrophic slow motion where your brain catalogs every way this could go wrong while being powerless to stop it. Cups clatter like a ceramic symphony of doom. Dark coffee arcs through air in perfect trajectory, defying gravity just long enough for me to appreciate its mathematical beauty. Lands squarely down some board member's ivory blazer that probably costs more than my annual salary. Silence. The horror-movie kind where everyone dies next. Every eye swings toward me like I've announced I'm carrying a bomb. Then they turn to Mr. Wolfe. He doesn't even blink or scowl. Just complete indifference, like I'm furniture that's fallen over. ""Clean it up."" Ice-cold voice, not cruel‚Äîthat requires emotion, just indifferent. Somehow infinitely worse than screaming. I grab napkins with shaking hands, moving on autopilot while my brain processes complete social annihilation. The board member glaring like I've ruined his genetic line. Patricia watching with barely concealed glee. Mr. Wolfe's already moved on. Talking Shanghai numbers like nothing happened. Like I don't exist. Later, in the elevator, I'm jabbing the close button like it owes me money when a hand shoots through the gap with reflexes suggesting athletic training or really good genetics. Mr. Wolfe steps in and suddenly the elevator feels coffin-sized. He's close enough I can smell cedar and something indefinitely masculine that makes my brain go inappropriately fuzzy. ""Do you always fold under pressure, Ms. Hartwell?"" His voice is quiet. The dangerous kind of quiet that makes smart people very nervous. ""I was multitasking between your four emergencies while trying not to have a complete breakdown,"" I snap, because self-preservation isn't my strength. He steps closer. Not threatening‚Äîsomething else entirely. Something that makes my pulse spike for reasons that have nothing to do with fear. ‚ÄúInteresting.‚Äù One word. But the way he says it, looking down at me with those green eyes that seem to see straight through my skull‚Äîit‚Äôs like he‚Äôs cataloging something. Filing away information. The elevator dings. He steps out like we were discussing the weather instead of‚Ä¶ whatever the hell that was. ‚ÄúGood night, Ms. Hartwell.‚Äù That night, I‚Äôm sitting beside Mia‚Äôs hospital bed, watching her draw with chunky crayons. She‚Äôs focused with that intense concentration only kids achieve, tongue poking out as she perfects her tiger‚Äôs stripes. Then she does something that makes me freeze completely. She drums her fingers against the bedside table. Three precise taps, pause. Three more taps, like morse code to the universe. Exactly like Zayden does during meetings when he‚Äôs thinking. ‚ÄúWhere did you learn that, baby?‚Äù She looks up, confused by the tension in my voice that I‚Äôm failing to hide. ‚ÄúLearn what, Mama?‚Äù ‚ÄúThe finger thing. The tapping.‚Äù Mia shrugs with casual six-year-old indifference, already turning back to her drawing. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.

I have always been very apologetic because of the way my father and step-mother treated me. My go-to response for anything (my fault or not) is always ""I'm sorry"". 

I've recently started a new job at a cafe and since I'm new, I'm constantly messing up little things or forgetting things and apologizing for it. Two of my coworkers have told me that I apologize too much and they're both helping me break the habit. One of them is even making me say three good things about myself every time I needlessly apologize to boost my confidence. 

But there is something I'm confused about: when should I say ""sorry""? I've always understood that ""sorry"" means you regret your actions for something you did (purposeful or not). I recognize that there are times I do it for no reason (like if it's honestly someone's fault and definitely not mine). But there are times when I do something wrong, like pour too much milk for a coffee or forget what someone ordered. But even for these, they're saying I don't need to ""be sorry"". I really don't understand what they mean. Am I using the word wrong? 

I've also been told not to say ""sorry"" when it comes to giving condolences to people. Like, my friend is complaining about some relationship drama or sum shit and I'm like ""Oh, I'm sorry about that"" and they're like ""You don't need to be sorry"". It's not like I'm blaming myself for their shit but I just feel bad they have to go through that. Is there a better phrase I should've using?

TLDR; My coworkers keep telling me to stop ""being sorry"" when I do things wrong but Idk what else to say besides ""I'm sorry"". Help???",1,1757125399.0,TooAfraidToAsk,4,0.66,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Humorous Prediction for KBO Showdown: Lotte Giants vs. SSG Landers (Sep 6, 2025)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a **KBO clash** that‚Äôs about to make your Monday morning coffee taste like champagne (or at least better than the Lotte Giants‚Äô recent offense). The **SSG Landers (-1.5, -200)** are favored to stomp the **Lotte Giants (+1.5, +150)** like a boss who just discovered they‚Äôre in charge of the company picnic.

**Why SSG Will Win:**

* The Landers‚Äô moneyline sits at **1.54-1.59**, implying bookmakers think they‚Äôve got a **64.9%-68.4% chance** to win. That‚Äôs not confidence‚Äîit‚Äôs a mathematical declaration that Lotte‚Äôs lineup is a leaky faucet in a hurricane.
* Their spread odds (-200) suggest they‚Äôre expected to win by **2 runs**, which feels generous if their pitching staff‚Äôs ERA is still higher than a toddler‚Äôs patience.

**Why Lotte Might Shock Us:**

* The Giants‚Äô **+150 to +177** underdog line implies a **35.1%-41.6% chance** to cover the 1.5-

Marketing tips?,"It's late, probably way too late, and my coffee's gone cold again. Just finished up fixing a weird edge case in the photo scanner for my new iOS app. Been thinking a lot about why most food tracking apps feel like such a chore. I mean, after a long day of coding or bouldering, opening MyFitnessPal or something similar felt like homework, every single time. It's the biggest reason I'd ditch calorie tracking eventually, even though I knew it helped me stay on top of things. I just needed something easier, something that didn't break my flow.

So, I started building my own solution, an app focused on the smallest possible action to log a meal. Think snap a photo, confirm, done. The AI actually works surprisingly well; it nails most common meals and gets the calorie count surprisingly accurate when you learn how to take a decent pic. Even estimates olive oil in the pan. The ""invisible"" calories everyone argues about, telling if something looks pan-fried versus grilled. I spent way too long on the UI/UX, probably a classic mistake for a solo founder, but I really wanted the experience to be smooth. Of course, AI isn't perfect, especially with super mixed-up foods, so I built in quick fallbacks like database search, manual input, and barcode scanning. But most of the time, the photo capture works, and it‚Äôs genuinely the easiest way I've found to keep up with my diet.

My question for you all, especially fellow iOS developers who've thought about this space: When it comes to everyday apps like this, what matters more to you as a user?¬†

1n9nwp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1n9nwp8/the_worst_body_aches_in_my_life_after_starting/,The worst body aches in my life AFTER starting low histamine diet,"Ok, a bit of a long back story but I‚Äôm hoping someone can help‚Ä¶ 

35 year old female in BC Canada 

-History of migraines every 6-8 weeks, preceded by cluster headaches 

-History of severe motion sickness. I cannot be a passenger on a vehicle at all ever. Seems to be related to my migraines. A migraine triggers the worst dizziness and I am pretty much comatose with a puke bowl nearby for 12-20 hours 

-History of severe PMDD, and heavy/prolonged menstrual bleeding. Currently I am bleeding heavily upwards of 12 days per month, and spotting for an additional 5-10. So mostly bleeding more often than not. 

-History of unexplained bruising 

-History of restless legs syndrome 

-Mental health history of PTSD from childhood trauma, as well as generalized anxiety and depression 

Current medications:
30mg Mirtazipine 
100mg gabapentin 
.35 mg Norethindrone
100mg reddy-progesterone 
Multivitamin 
Magnesium 
Iron supplement 

So here‚Äôs the backstory. I finally got referred to a hematologist and a gynaecologist to try to figure out this bleeding. It has been going on for years. All lab work and endometrial biopsy came back normal. Gynaecologist started me on the mini pill and progesterone about 6 months ago. No change in my bleeding whatsoever. Previously I tried the mirena IUD which also did not change the bleeding. But in terms of medical diagnosis, I‚Äôm all clear and there‚Äôs no pinpointed reason why I‚Äôm bleeding all the time. But I am, and I subsequently feel like shit all the time. 

I also know that my nervous system is in overdrive/constant fight or flight from the PTSD and just general life stress (I have a lot of it). I feel like I‚Äôm always ‚Äúwired.‚Äù Add in a bit of depression and the bleeding issues and I just feel exhausted, depleted, sluggish, and awful most days. 

So eventually I decided to try seeing a different doctor because my GP basically shrugs her shoulders and isn‚Äôt doing anything to help me feel better. 

New doctor took a very thorough history and had some interesting theories. He thinks it‚Äôs possible that I am somewhat histamine intolerant and told me to try a low-histamine diet for a few weeks. He also sent for further lab work which I have not been able to do yet (just due to scheduling conflicts). Notably he is testing my thyroid, homocysteine, and testosterone. He also informed me that I may be somewhat gluten sensitive - my tissue transglutaminase ab was tested years ago and was 5.5 one time and 6.5 another time. My GP never brought this up to me at all. So he also recommended I cut out gluten as a trial to see if anything changes. The underlying reason he thinks I am histamine intolerant is because it can be linked to many of my symptoms such as headaches/dizziness, PMDD and menstrual irregularities, anxiety/mood disorder, and I had a severe case of cold urticaria that lasted for about 2 years and then went away. He said something about methylation and a build up of estrogen in my body which I didn‚Äôt fully understand. 

I am now on day 7 of a strict low histamine gluten free diet. I am also on day 5 of having a very mild head cold (slight sniffles and scratchy throat). No fever. But I have THE ABSOLUTE WORST BODY ACHES OF MY LIFE. It feels like every muscle is tense and aching from the top of my spine all the way down and around both hips and into my upper legs. I am in agony. I barely slept last night. I have tried a hot bath, heating pad, voltaren topical gel, and Tylenol (no nsaids due to the low histamine diet). 

Do you think the body aches could have to do with the diet change? Or just a random coincidence? I neeeeeed it to go away it is so painful I am tempted to go to ER. 

Previous to this low histamine and gluten free diet I ate pretty healthy in my opinion. Lots of protein and veggies. The main things I have cut out that were dietary staples for me are coffee, spinach, red and yellow peppers, yogurt, oat milk, occasionally whole grain toast or a granola bar, and peanut butter.

Crack!   
  
My fianc√© hit me.  
  
Three minutes ago, I had been daydreaming about how to decorate our ridiculously expensive penthouse apartment, where every corner looked like it belonged on the cover of a magazine.  
  
Two minutes ago, I accidentally broke a mug.  
  
Then, Rhys slapped me across the face-hard.  
  
My cheek burned like it had been seared by fire.  
  
It took a full thirty seconds before my brain restarted, slowly piecing reality back together.  
  
""Are you f\*\*king insane?"" I gritted my teeth, forcing the words through the cracks of my jaw.  
  
Rhys's lips were pressed into a cold, tight line, his expression dark and resolute.   
  
""It was just a mug with Catherine's face on it,"" he said, as if my reaction was an overblown performance, not the result of something horrifying he had just done.  
  
""You have got to be f\*\*king kidding me."" I stared at him in disbelief, my ch\*\*t heaving as rage and humiliation churned violently inside me, ready to explode.  
  
For half a second-just half-something like guilt flickered across his face. Then it vanished, consumed by a storm of fury.  
  
""No, you're the insane one!"" he roared. ""I already agreed to marry you-what more do you want? Catherine's gone, but you still broke that mug on purpose!""  
  
His voice trembled with anger. ""She was your sister! She had to leave because of you! And now you're jealous of her? You won't rest until every trace of her is erased, will you?""  
  
The hatred in his eyes cut deeper than the s\*\*p.  
  
My cheek throbbed. My hand was still bl\*\*ding. But nothing hurt more than my heart.  
  
I forced myself to unclench my jaw and made one last attempt to explain. ""It wasn't me. I never asked her to leave.""  
  
Technically speaking, I understood why someone might say that. Catherine had left behind a letter.   
  
In it, she said she'd seen my diary, realized I had a crush on Rhys, and decided to ""let go,"" to ""let him be yours.""  
  
I don't think she ever understood that a diary meant privacy. I never meant for anyone to read it, but not only did she read it-she told everyone.  
  
No one cared about the pain I felt when my secret was exposed. I was dragged out, nailed to a pillar of shame, forced to pay for her so-called noble sacrifice.  
  
To my family, it was like I'd been bumped up to the starting lineup out of nowhere, replacing the golden girl-I should've been grateful.   
  
Even if Rhys had st\*\*bed me in the gut, they'd still find a way to excuse it.  
  
It was as if my parents had always hated me. No matter how much better I did than Catherine, they always saw me as bitter, as someone who couldn't protect her fragile pride.  
  
The searing pain on my cheek intensified.  
  
My fingers clenched tightly around the engagement ring. A wave of heat-anger, humiliation, resentment-rose in my throat.  
  
Hot tears welled in my eyes, blurring my vision. I blinked fast, wiping them away before they could fall.  
  
I would not cry. I would never show weakness in front of him.  
  
I took a heavy step toward the door, struggling to move. I had to get out of there, or I would completely fall apart.   
  
Whatever shred of dignity I had left-I couldn't let it be destroyed in front of this man.  
  
Rhys suddenly grabbed my wrist and yanked me back. ""Clean it up.""  
  
I looked up at him in disbelief, needing to confirm I'd heard him right.  
  
""You broke the mug. You clean up the pieces."" His voice was icy, absolute.  
  
He had to be insane.  
  
""No."" I lifted my chin and spat the word without an ounce of compromise.  
  
His face tightened, jaw clenched. ""You sure you want to do this?""  
  
""Yes. I said no."" My eyes were red, but they blazed with defiance as I stared him down without flinching.  
  
If love meant I had to grind my self-respect into the dirt, then it was worthless to me.  
  
The air between us was taut enough to snap. I could almost hear it crackling. The fury in his eyes was an uncontrollable blaze, threatening to consume me.   
  
And beneath that fire, I saw something else-disbelief. The once docile little lamb had bared her fangs.  
  
He took a step closer, menace radiating from him. ""Last chance. If you don't obey me, then we-""  
  
""-are over,"" I finished for him, cold and final.  
  
Shock froze his face. For a moment, the air went still. He hadn't expected me to actually say it.  
  
While he was caught in that moment of confusion, I wrenched my arm free from his grip.   
  
The taste of freedom hadn't yet bloomed in my ch\*\*t when he snapped back to life, grabbing my arm again with brutal force.  
  
Now.  
  
I spun around without hesitation and raised my hand-sm\*\*k! A resounding s\*\*p landed hard across Rhys's handsome, arrogant face.  
  
The air froze again, thick with silence.  
  
My palm tingled slightly, but it brought a rush of fierce, unprecedented satisfaction.  
  
Rhys staggered back a few steps, his eyes wide with shock and disbelief-not from the pain, but from a world turned upside down.  
  
He never thought I would dare. After all, I had once loved him so deeply.  
  
I lowered my hand, lifted my chin, and looked calmly at his stunned expression. I gave him a faint smile. ""Now we're even.""  
  
Without waiting another moment, I dragged my feet away from that suffocating h\*\*l.  
  
If I stayed even one more second, I would break down. I'd rather choke on my own tears than let him see them fall.  
  
Then-thud-I fell.  
  
High heels and emotional chaos are a terrible match.  
  
Pain shot through my palms and knees as they scraped against the hard marble. Bl\*\*d surged out instantly, but I barely felt it.  
  
I got up, grabbed my purse, and kept walking.  
  
Home. I just wanted to go home. Away from all of this. Away from him.  
  
Like a woman fleeing the scene of a crime, I burst out of the building-only to slam into a wall of mu\*\*le and the in\*\*xicating scent of expensive cologne.  
  
I looked up-and saw sharp, sculpted features with an aura so commanding it could silence a room.   
  
He looked like the kind of man who, if you pissed him off, wouldn't just ruin your life-he'd erase your entire existence.  
  
Unfortunately, that only made him more attractive.  
  
For a second, I wished he would throw me over his shoulder and carry me to his lair-my face flushed red instantly.   
  
I snapped myself back to reality.  
  
""Sorry,"" I mumbled and rushed into the elevator of my apartment building.  
  
Back upstairs, I rummaged through my bag. My heart sank.  
  
No keys.  
  
Of course. The universe had clearly declared today The End of Mira Day.  
  
Frustration and helplessness surged in my ch\*\*t. I kicked off my heels and shook the doorknob violently. It didn't help-but I needed to let it out.   
  
Why did everyone always choose Catherine?! Hadn't I done enough?  
  
I collapsed against the wall, sliding down to the cold floor as sobs tore from my throat. The tears came in a flood, impossible to stop.  
  
Just as I was nearly choking on my own cries, a voice-low, smooth, like black velvet-cut through the air behind me.  
  
""Your key.""  
  
Fury sparked in my veins. Why did someone always interrupt me just when I was about to get it all out?  
  
Annoyed, I turned, ready to glare-only to freeze.  
  
Through tear-blurred eyes, I saw him again. The man I had bumped into downstairs-the one who looked like he had stepped out of a Renaissance painting.  
  
""Your key fell,"" he said, raising an eyebrow as his gaze landed on the scattered contents of my purse. ""That's probably why you couldn't find it.""  
  
I stared at the key resting in his elegant hand, my face flushing so hot it could've lit a match.  
  
I snatched it from him and fumbled to unlock the door, stumbling inside without a word.  
  
It wasn't until my back hit the door that I realized-I hadn't even thanked him.  
  
Great job, Mira. You absolute id\*\*t.  
  
Hesitating, I crept toward the peephole. Through that tiny lens, I saw him calmly turn, unlock the door directly across the hall, and stroll inside.  
  
He lived across from me?  
  
He must have just moved in. With a face like that-and that aura-there's no way I wouldn't have noticed before.  
  
Wait, Mira. What are you doing? You're seriously letting a hot new neighbor make you forget the h\*\*l Rhys just put you through?  
  
No. Absolutely not. All men are tr\*\*h. Always.  
  
I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to steady my racing heartbeat, reminding myself not to be so st\*\*id again.   
  
But no matter how hard I tried, that sculpted face kept flashing through my mind.  
  
I needed ice-for my racing pulse, and more urgently, for the stinging pain on my cheek.  
  
Just as I forced myself up to head to the kitchen, my phone rang, shrill and sharp.  
  
One glance at the screen made my whole body go cold.  
  
Mom.  
  
I couldn't ignore the call. If I did, she would destroy my career without hesitation. She was absolutely capable of it.  
  
The moment I picked up, her voice sliced through the air-cold and merciless.  
  
""Mira, you must be insane! How dare you do something so disgraceful to Rhys! You apologize to him right now, or you're no longer our daughter!""  
  
I opened my mouth to explain, stunned-but she hung up before I could get a single word out.  
  
I gripped my phone tightly. Why was it that no matter how hard I tried, I still couldn't earn even a sliver of their love?   
  
And Catherine-she never had to do anything, yet she was their perfect, precious jewel.  
  
Enough.  
  
I thought if I worked hard enough, my family, my fianc√©-they would love me.  
  
But that's never going to happen.  
  
I have to reclaim the self-respect I lost long ago.  
  
I have to break off this engagement with Rhys-no matter the consequences.  
  
  
Chapter 2 Plan B  
For the next forty-eight hours, I became one with my bed.  
  
No calls. No outside world. Just me, a pile of blankets, and the crushing weight of humiliation.  
  
That s\*\*p from Rhys wasn't just a blow to the face. In so many ways, it was a s\*\*p across my entire life-one steeped in desperation, delusion, and pathetic longing.   
  
It forced me awake. It made me look back on everything I'd ever done to make him notice me, everything I'd done for a fantasy called ""us"" that had never truly existed.  
  
God, where do I even begin?  
  
Like the time he casually mentioned he liked girls with smooth, silky hair. That night, I ordered three bottles of the shampoo he'd once praised.   
  
My scalp broke out in hives. I smiled through the pain and said, ""It's fine-some allergic reactions are worth it.""  
  
Or when he told me he was too busy with work to grab dinner, so I stayed up learning how to bake and brought him a box of pastries in the rain.   
  
He didn't even open the door-just had the receptionist tell me, ""Don't bother next time. I don't like sweets.""  
  
Then there was that night at his friend's dinner party. I forced down oysters-my most hated food-just to seem ""graceful and agreeable.""   
  
I spent the entire night crouched over a toilet, writhing in pain until 3 a.m. He didn't ask if I was okay. He laughed and said, ""Can't even handle seafood? That's just dramatic.""  
  
But the worst?  
  
That time he quoted a line from The Godfather he liked. I stayed up all night reading film essays just to casually drop the quote at a party.  
  
I got it wrong. He corrected me in front of everyone, sneering, ""Don't pretend to like things you clearly don't understand.""  
  
And I laughed. I laughed and said, ""You've got such a good memory.""  
  
What a joke. I never realized I was never the person he wanted.  
  
He never really saw me. To him, I was nothing more than a low-rent version of the ""perfect and untouchable"" Catherine. A cheap stand-in.  
  
I wasn't her, but I could offer him the faint illusion of having her again. That was all I was good for.  
  
I buried my face in the pillow and laughed until I shook. Not because it was funny-but because the pain had gone too deep for tears.  
  
Thankfully, after my parents delivered their final ultimatum two days ago, they hadn't contacted me again.  
  
A small part of me wondered-did Rhys intervene? Did he finally realize what he'd done?  
  
Suddenly, the doorbell rang.  
  
And it didn't stop ringing.  
  
For a full five minutes.  
  
I gr\*\*ned into my pillow. Oh god. Social interaction.  
  
Dragging my exhausted body to the door, I opened it.  
  
Yvaine Carlisle-my best friend and the only person who had the legal right to yell at me-stood on the other side, hands on hips. Then her eyes landed on my face.  
  
Her expression froze. The light in her eyes dimmed. ""What the h\*\*l happened to you?""  
  
""I'm fine,"" I said, trying to sound casual. She wasn't buying it.  
  
She reached out, gently tucking a strand of hair behind my ear. Her jaw clenched.  
  
Then-silence.  
  
Not the awkward kind. The dangerous kind. The kind that comes right before something explodes.  
  
""Who hit you?""  
  
""Come inside,"" I muttered quickly, trying not to draw the neighbors' attention. That would be mortifying.  
  
Yvaine didn't move. She gripped my arm and spoke through gritted teeth. ""Mira. Who. Hit. You?""  
  
As soon as the door clicked shut, I collapsed into her arms. My face buried in her sweater, and within seconds, the fabric was soaked.  
  
She didn't flinch. She just held me, her hand moving in calm, soothing circles across my back.  
  
I didn't know how long I cried. Long enough for my throat to burn and my nose to turn bright red like Rudolph. Eventually, I managed to force out a single word.  
  
""Rhys.""  
  
Yvaine didn't move.  
  
Everyone in Skyline City knew that name. Rhys Granger wasn't the kind of man who needed to throw punches to destroy someone.  
  
One phone call to the right person, and your life would be over. Reputation, money, status-he had it all.  
  
Every move he made was deliberate, timed to perfection-like the ticking of a Rolex.   
  
When he chose to go to war, he was a nobleman wielding cruelty like fine art, probably with a glass of aged Sc\*\*ch in hand.  
  
People called him arrogant. No one ever called him vi\*\*ent.  
  
That's why, when Yvaine processed what I'd just said, I could practically hear the gears in her brain screaming in protest.  
  
""No way,"" she muttered under her breath, as if denying it out loud might somehow make it untrue. ""Rhys? Your Rhys? He couldn't have...""  
  
I got it. I really did. Rhys was supposed to be the gentleman. The golden boy. The flawless, elegant, untouchable good guy.  
  
""It was him,"" I said quietly.  
  
She exhaled sharply, then started rubbing my back again, this time slower. ""Tell me what happened.""  
  
I swallowed. ""I was at his place. I, uh... accidentally broke a mug.""  
  
Her entire body tensed. ""Just a mug?""  
  
I nodded.  
  
Silence. Then she clenched her jaw and said, ""I swear to God, if you tell me it was some priceless, hand-crafted, one-of-a-kind family heirloom-""  
  
""It was Catherine's mug.""  
  
Yvaine's hand froze mid-pat.  
  
Everything shifted. One second, she was my concerned best friend. The next, she was a woman plotting mu\*\*er.  
  
I grabbed her wrist before she could get ahold of something worse. ""It's over between Rhys and me.""  
  
""Really?""  
  
""Really. Even if the earth split in two and Skyline City sank into the ocean, I wouldn't marry him.""  
  
That stopped her from storming out to commit ho\*\*cide.  
  
""Catherine. That venomous snake-"" Yvaine spat the name like it physically hurt her.   
  
""She's not even here anymore and she's still managing to wreck your life! And your parents? They just stand there watching! I swear, they could watch her light your house on fire and they'd hand her the matches. It's unbelievable!""  
  
I felt like a balloon someone had just popped-deflated, exhausted. That all-too-familiar ache settled deep in my ch\*\*t.  
  
I knew some parents would always love their firstborn more. And there was nothing I could do about it.  
  
""I'm sorry, Mira.""  
  
Yvaine sat down beside me and gave my head a firm push toward her shoulder. I pulled away and managed a weak smile.   
  
""Actually, I think it's a good thing. At least I found out what kind of man he is before we got married. Better now than after the vows, right?""  
  
She let out a long sigh, her eyes softening. ""Mira, you know no matter what happens, I've got your back.""  
  
Right then, my stomach growled loud enough to interrupt the moment. Loudly.  
  
Like a magician, Yvaine reached behind her and pulled out a takeout bag, giving me a look that practically screamed: I knew you'd be like this.  
  
I wanted to hug her, but I was too busy eating like a ravenous little goblin.  
  
After dinner, she pushed me into the bedroom and went off to clean up. I lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling, drained and overwhelmed. What now?  
  
Through the half-open door, I heard her on the phone. I didn't catch every word, but the ones I did hear... were iconic.  
  
""A pile of s\*\*t.""  
  
""Total f\*\*king psycho.""  
  
""Oh, you think that's bad? Wait till I tell you what this vi\*\*ent ba\*\*ard actually did-""  
  
She was probably talking to Zane Hasterton. And unlike Rhys, Zane would never raise a hand to her.  
  
The way Yvaine so instantly, so fiercely chose me-without hesitation, without question-made my throat tighten. She believed me. No one else did. But she did.  
  
This wasn't something she did lightly. Rhys's family sat at the very top of the food chain-untouchable. And I had no doubt her parents wouldn't be thrilled to see her go up against them.  
  
I curled deeper under the blanket and let out a slow breath.  
  
Why couldn't my parents love me like that?  
  
Ever since their favorite daughter Houdini'd her way out of their master plan, I became Plan B. But that didn't mean they forgave my existence.  
  
Let's be honest: the only reason they'd stopped actively berating me was because I got engaged to Rhys.   
  
That little arrangement somehow elevated me from ""irreparable family di\*\*race"" to ""potential saving grace.""  
  
Part of the reason I agreed to the engagement-and I know how pathetic this sounds-was because I thought maybe I could finally get something Catherine had: a sliver of parental affection.   
  
A crumb of approval.  
  
But now that the engagement was off?  
  
I was disposable again.  
  
Last I heard, they were boxing up my things, ready to ship me off to some remote jungle where I'd spend the rest of my life befriending anacondas and repenting for my sins.  
  
They were absolutely capable of that.  
  
I gr\*\*ned into my pillow. What the h\*\*l do I do now?  
  
Unless... I married someone more powerful than Rhys.  
  
The idea was so ridiculous I snorted. Right. Because billionaires are just wandering around Skyline City hoping to marry a 23-year-old orphan with no patience for their bullshit.  
  
And yet-  
  
A face flashed in my mind.  
  
Three days ago. My new neighbor.  
  
I remembered, quite inappropriately, thinking I wouldn't mind being alone with him in his apartment where he could do all sorts of rated-R things to me.  
  
I shook my head, quickly banishing the thought. I didn't even know his name. Just that he had the kind of aura that could slice a person in half.  
  
No. Way too dangerous.  
  
I gr\*\*ned again.  
  
If I hadn't broken that st\*\*id mug, everything might've been okay.  
  
But it wasn't. And it's not. And there's no going back.  
  
F\*\*k! Why am I the one trying to fix this when I wasn't even the one who messed it up?! I sat up-and bam, the door burst open.  
  
Yvaine marched in. ""Sl\*\*p is just going to make you feel worse. We're getting up, and we're going to find a d\*\*k worth loving-one that's better than Rhys's.""  
  
WHAT?!  
  
While I gaped, she had already changed me into a new outfit.  
  
Just like that, we were off to Skyline City's most exclusive club-members only.  
  
  
Chapter 3 Rebound Night  
""Is this really necessary?"" I stood at the end of the line, shivering, tugging desperately at the hem of my tragically short skirt.   
  
I could practically feel it-if I opened my mouth to speak, my un\*\*rwear would be on full display.  
  
""Sweetheart, we paid a fortune to get into this place. Of course we're going all in. Do you not get it?""   
  
Yvaine declared like a mafia queen, standing tall against the icy wind in her five-inch heels without the slightest trace of fear.  
  
""But isn't this a little too-"" I didn't even get to finish before a brutal gust of wind slapped me across the face like it had a personal vendetta.   
  
I immediately zipped up my puffer jacket and curled into myself like a frozen shrimp.  
  
Yvaine let out a dramatic gr\*\*an. ""Mira, come on. We're going to a b\*r, not an Arctic expedition.""  
  
""I'm just glad I won't be hospitalized for hypothermia tonight, thanks,"" I snapped back.  
  
She rolled her eyes so hard I thought they might fall out, gave me a once-over full of disappointment-but said nothing more. Small victory. My puffer jacket was safe-for now.  
  
I'd thought we'd have to wait in line like everyone else. That was the whole reason I wore this thermal fortress of a coat. But clearly, I had underestimated Yvaine.  
  
She had zero plans to follow the rules.  
  
With the ease of someone who'd done this a thousand times, she slipped a rolled-up bill into the bouncer's hand, her palm casually grazing his rock-hard ch\*\*t like a Bond girl who'd forgotten her martini.  
  
Ten seconds. That's all it took. We were in.  
  
Yvaine was the kind of beautiful that made men forget protocol-and ethics-in an instant.  
  
And just like that, we breezed into Roxanne.  
  
The place was thick with heat, perfume, and the effervescent scent of ch\*\*pagne.   
  
I ripped off my coat the second we stepped inside, only to be met with an are-you-trying-to-embarrass-me glare from Yvaine.  
  
She handed her coat off to a passing server with a flick of her fingers, like she'd personally hired the man. Regal, effortless, born for this.  
  
I tried to copy her moves. Failed miserably. Nearly dropped my purse and stumbled like a hamster who'd just woken up from a freezer nap.  
  
Graceful? No. I looked like roadkill in Gucci heels.  
  
If I hadn't known each co\*\*tail here cost about the same as my checking account balance, I might've even convinced myself I was pulling it off.  
  
""Jesus Christ!"" I gasped, eyes glued to the menu like it had just in\*\*lted my entire bloodline.  
  
Yvaine gave me a sideways glance and scoffed. ""Relax. Tonight's on me.""  
  
I exhaled with something dangerously close to gratitude.  
  
Considering I'd nearly broken off an engagement, risked being exiled to some remote tropical island by my parents, and needed to budget for anti-snake spray, I needed all the charity I could get.  
  
Price tags aside, the view was elite: ambitious young actors, outrageously good-looking models, and a legion of finance bros who looked like they gave TED talks while wearing Burberry.  
  
It was a glittering buffet of vanity and hormones, wrapped in velvet lighting and the illusion of power.  
  
We found a table near the b\*r and hadn't even ordered drinks when a bartender locked eyes on us.  
  
Well. He was hard to miss-tall, sculpted features, sleeves rolled to the elbows just enough to show off well-trained forearms.  
  
He shouldn't be mixing drinks-he should be in the Louvre. Or at the very least starring in Dior's newest fragrance campaign.   
  
Maybe that's why this club was so expensive: even the staff had to be perfect.  
  
""Two 75s, French br\*\*dy,"" Before I could even locate the cheapest drink on the menu, Yvaine had already tossed her order at the ba\*\*ender. ""Make it strong.""  
  
And of course, she didn't forget to flash her signature smile-the one that balanced perfectly between s\*\*y and innocent, chin tilted just enough to say ""Oops, didn't mean to flirt.""  
  
The ba\*\*ender reached effortlessly for the g\*n, giving her a half-smile. ""Rough night?""  
  
""More like an engagement-level disaster,"" she said, casually pointing her thumb at me. ""And it's wrapping up real soon.""  
  
I glanced at her. ""Thrilled that my personal life is now public broadcast.""  
  
She patted my hand with mock sympathy. ""Sweetie, this place runs on romantic catastrophes. Without bad decisions, no one would be buying drinks.""  
  
Then she turned away and melted into the crowd, flipping into Social Queen Mode like someone had hit a switch.  
  
In under ten seconds, she completed a visual sweep-like a hawk zeroing in on prey-before spinning back around and pointing her perfectly manicured finger toward the edge of the dance floor.  
  
""Okay, listen. You need a rebound. Exhibit A: Six-foot-two, hair neater than your ex-fianc√©'s moral compass, shirt unbuttoned just enough to scream s\*\*y without slipping into cheap. He either owns a yacht or, at the very least, a VIP card.""  
  
I shook my head. ""Nope.""  
  
Her eyes flicked to a new direction. ""Exhibit B: struggling musician. Dressed like payday hasn't happened yet, but he's hot enough you'd forgive him. You'd fund his next album and still sl\*\*p like a baby.""  
  
""Pass.""  
  
She sighed, then pointed again. ""Fine. Exhibit C: total dad vibes-but the good kind. Like 'books your doctor's appointment and your breakfast' dad, not 'calls the waitress 'sweetheart' and thinks climate change is a myth' dad.""  
  
I gr\*\*ned into my hands. ""Yvaine, please.""  
  
She didn't back down. ""Mira, you cannot sit here like a decorative wall gecko. Tonight is about rebooting your life, not stitching up emotional wounds.""  
  
Just as she geared up for a fourth round of rebound recommendations, she suddenly froze. It was like someone had hit mute on her entire system.  
  
Then, far too casually, she said, ""Hey, want to hit the bathroom?""  
  
I narrowed my eyes. ""No?""  
  
""...Or maybe let's move tables? The vibe here's weird."" Her smile was tight, and her voice cracked like a pair of worn-out heels.  
  
Weird vibe? We'd only been sitting for ten minutes, and we just ordered drinks. By Yvaine's standards, we hadn't even made it past the opening credits.  
  
Then I followed her gaze.  
  
A half-private booth.  
  
Rhys.  
  
He had his arm draped around a woman. Her head rested on his shoulder, makeup flawless, smile polished and effortless.  
  
I didn't need more details.  
  
That face-I would never forget it.  
  
Four years ago, a girl vanished under mysterious circumstances.   
  
I, in all my na?ve glory, believed she had simply ""stepped aside,"" choosing to selflessly walk away from a future with Rhys.  
  
And now, here was Catherine-perched on my ex-fianc√©'s lap, locked in a pose so in\*\*mate.  
  
I had told myself I was over it. Over him. We'd broken up. It was done. Time to move on.  
  
Until I heard what came next.  
  
""Honestly, I didn't think she'd fall apart over a coffee mug.""  
  
Catherine's voice was soft, full of false pity-the kind that sounded like she'd just k\*\*led someone and was now gently tucking a blanket over the body.  
  
She gently swirled the w\*\*e in her glass, her lips curling into a near-perfect smile.   
  
""Of course I put that mug somewhere obvious. I wanted her to notice. After all, she still doesn't know you've been seeing me behind her back. It was time she caught a little hint, wasn't it?""  
  
She looked up at Rhys, eyes glowing with admiration.   
  
""Honestly though, darling, your performance was spot-on. Even I almost believed you were worried she'd find out about us, instead of just helping me pull off the scene.""  
  
""She's so st\*\*id-of course she thought you were upset about the mug, not terrified of exposing your af\*\*ir.""  
  
Rhys chuckled softly, smug and relaxed. ""I had to act like I cared. She spends every day trying to be the perfect girlfriend. If she found out all her effort still couldn't compete with you, she'd lose it.""  
  
Catherine laughed under her breath and patted his ch\*\*t.  
  
""Don't worry. Knowing Mira, she's probably still scrambling to fix things. She's the type who always believes that if she just tries hard enough, people will finally see her worth.""  
  
Her laugh turned soft, laced with pity so sharp it felt like a bl\*\*e.  
  
""But the harder she tries, the more pathetic she looks. And me? I just 'happened' to return home. Her parents don't know a thing. They didn't even get the chance to stop me. Tomorrow, I'll be seeing them in broad daylight-because she gave up the engagement herself, and you, dear, are blameless.""  
  
Catherine leaned back with a triumphant sigh. ""Isn't this the best ending? I never gave up on you. I was just waiting for her to step aside.""  
  
Rhys nodded slowly, a small smirk on his lips. ""You're right. You always are.""  
  
A loud roar rang in my ears, and my heartbeat pounded against my skull like a war drum.  
  
Yvaine must've been saying something-pleading with me to stay calm, not to do anything st\*\*id-but I didn't hear a word.  
  
I wasn't the same Mira who swallowed her pride for praise anymore.  
  
I slipped free from Yvaine's grip and turned to the bartender. ""Your best red. Put it on Rhys Granger's tab.""  
  
The ba\*\*ender-bless his beautiful, rule-breaking soul-didn't even flinch. He handed me the bottle like I'd just ordered mineral water.  
  
With the bottle in hand, I had a mission. A singular, burning purpose.  
  
The bouncer moved to stop me, but one look at my face-like a vengeful goddess straight from h\*\*l-made him wisely back off, hands raised in surrender.  
  
I marched straight toward Rhys and Catherine. They were lip-locked in some dramatic, second-rate soap opera make-out scene.  
  
I raised the bottle-and smashed it, with all my strength.  
  
Glass shattered with a sharp crack, spraying across the table. Rhys's forehead split instantly, a trail of bl\*\*d beginning to drip down between his brows.  
  
Catherine screamed and leapt off his lap. ""Mirabelle?! Are you insane?! What are you doing here?!""  
  
She scrambled to find a lie, panic rising in her voice. ""You're misunderstanding, it's not what you think-""  
  
Rhys cut her off, his hand gripping her arm, his gaze dark and cold. ""Don't bother explaining, Catherine. It doesn't matter. My parents will take your side, no matter what. We're just correcting an old mistake.""  
  
Catherine's panic twisted into smugness in an instant. She curled into his side with sickening sweetness and cooed, ""Oh, honey, your head's bl\*\*ding. We have to get to the hospital.""  
  
Before I could say anything, Yvaine rushed to my side, fury radiating from every pore.   
  
She raised her hand, ready to s\*\*p Catherine straight back to whatever pit she'd crawled out of. ""You disgusting, two-faced bi\*\*h-!""  
  
I grabbed her wrist, steady and cold. ""Yvaine, let them go. If they stay here one more second, I might lose my appetite permanently.""  
  
I locked eyes with Catherine's smug little face and raised my voice deliberately. ""After all, the theme of this place is premium taste, not some clearance aisle for secondhand tr\*\*h.""  
  
Catherine's smile froze on her lips. Rhys's face darkened, but they had no chance to respond.  
  
Yvaine, emboldened, lifted her chin and sneered at the bouncers. ""Well? What are you waiting for? Kindly es\*\*rt these two walking health code violations off the premises.""  
  
  
Chapter 4 Key Guy  
As soon as they were gone, Yvaine dragged me out of the club.  
  
D\*\*n it. I hated that Catherine had predicted every single thought running through my mind.  
  
Yes, I was still considering salvaging my relationship with Rhys.  
  
But now? The truth was right there, unmistakable and r\*w-they'd been sl\*\*ping together behind my back all along.   
  
And me? I was just the fo\*\*ish, unnecessary third wheel in their twisted little story.  
  
What I couldn't figure out was-why had Catherine faked her disappearance four years ago? What exactly had she been hiding? And why come back now?  
  
My eyes stung. I tilted my head toward the sky, forcing the tears back.  
  
Fine. Catherine's back. Perfect. Now they could all reunite like a happy little four-piece family?, and I... I was finally free.  
  
""Mira... I'm so sorry. I had no idea they'd be there tonight. I didn't even know Catherine was back."" Yvaine's eyes were full of regret.  
  
I gave a bitter laugh and shook my head. ""Neither did I. But I heard it loud and clear-they've been screwing around for a while. To them, I was just in the way.""  
  
""Those godd\*\*n as\*\*oles!"" Yvaine hissed through clenched teeth.   
  
""You should tell your parents. Let them know Catherine's not the perfect angel they think she is. What about Rhys's parents? No way they'll tolerate a scandal like this.  
  
I was quiet for a moment. Yvaine had a point-Rhys's parents were the only people who had supported me.   
  
But he was their son. They wouldn't choose me over him. Not in the end.  
  
And my parents? I let out a breath, heavy and tired. ""You know better than anyone-they only care about Catherine. No matter what I do, I'll never replace her.""

1n9nv8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/goosecreekcandles/comments/1n9nv8i/help/,HELP!‚òïÔ∏èüïØÔ∏è,"Hi friends, I am fairly new to GooseCreek...I've placed about 3 orders so far, but have browsed the site religiously and have memorized the scent notes for just about each candle LOL. Somehow, I never came across Sweet Espresso until a few weeks ago...never saw it before that. I ordered it as soon as I saw it (I LOVE coffee scented candles). Now, it's gone from the site so I'm guessing it's discontinued. Can someone provide any insight as to seasonal releases, core candles that never leave, etc.? It does show on the candle's page that it's out of stock and it gives an option to be notified when it's back in stock. Someone PLEASE tell me that it's just temporarily out of stock and will be back soon. (The reason I think it MAY just be temporarily out of stock is because other seasonal candles that have sold out just don't show up anymore...they don't have an option for ""Notify when back in stock.) If you've read this far, thank you...you're a saint! LOL

BTW, if you enjoy straight up coffee scents, this one's for you. It is SO strong...I smelled it as soon as I opened the box (and there were 8 other candles in it.) Throw is 100/10!

‚ÄºÔ∏èEdited to add: I cannot find the listing for this candle anymore...:( Only the wax melts.

1n9ntzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1n9ntzh/barkbound/,Barkbound,"Warmth woke me‚Äîa loving, squeezing warmth on my arm. My eyes peeked open to see my father nose-to-nose with me, his coffee-scented breath harsh as he whispered. I stared blankly, knowing he expected action, not words. At one year old, doctors noticed I was different, developing slower‚Äîstruggling to sit up or keep my head steady. But Dad, who refused to let me linger in bed‚Äôs bliss, worked with me daily, making me stronger, smarter, more independent. Independence was his recent obsession, especially for this trip with me and my older brother, Charlie, to the new cabin. Charlie, my motivation, was already devouring chocolate chip pancakes while I hadn‚Äôt started. He‚Äôs the best big brother, always helping, like loading the car with camping supplies and securing my purple plushy elephant‚Äîstrapped in the backseat for ‚Äúsafety‚Äù‚Äîwhich I‚Äôd have forgotten, causing a meltdown like last year. Dad‚Äôs cringy announcement interrupted my pancake battle, and Mom ushered away our dishes, planting long forehead kisses.


‚ÄúBehave and listen to your dad; he‚Äôs got lots to teach you,‚Äù she said sweetly, guiding us to the garage.


I climbed into Dad‚Äôs car, clutching my elephant, careful on the slippery side rails. Mom gave me a final ‚Äúsmooch for the road‚Äù before turning to Charlie.


‚ÄúChar‚Äî‚Äù she began.

‚ÄúHoney, Charlie knows how to operate,‚Äù Dad interrupted, smiling at Charlie.


‚ÄúI‚Äôll text when the boys can‚Äôt stop raving about their cool dad,‚Äù he added.


Mom laughed. ‚ÄúOkay, okay. Boys, you little men, make sure Dad remembers his radio is in the glove box. We don‚Äôt need him searching for service in an emergency.‚Äù


We nodded, assuring her. After her final smooches, we waved as Dad pulled out, our boys‚Äô adventure beginning.

The drive was a blur of naps, interrupted by Dad‚Äôs awful rendition of ‚ÄúCarry On Wayward Son,‚Äù butchering the lyrics despite knowing the song forever. The road grew bumpy, like climbing Everest.


‚ÄúBoys, we‚Äôre here!‚Äù Dad announced, glancing at me in the rearview. ‚ÄúI know someone‚Äôs looking forward to Dad‚Äôs famous s‚Äômores! This cabin has a bigger fire pit and a creek for swimming.‚Äù


My smile widened as we piled out. While Dad unloaded, Charlie and I raced to the cabin door, stopping when he noticed notches in the frame with years etched beside them. Dad, huffing from carrying bags, joined us.


‚ÄúWell, I assume these are from the previous owners,‚Äù he said, patting my head. ‚ÄúWe did this when I was little. The notches track how much you grow each year.‚Äù


Charlie nodded, grabbing bags to help. ‚ÄúThis place must be pretty old then, huh, Dad? Some of those dates go back to the ‚Äô20s.‚Äù


Dad chuckled. ‚ÄúMy great-great-grandfather built this place with his own hands. It‚Äôs been a big part of our family until my grandfather lost it to the bank. New owners came, but it‚Äôs back on the market‚Äîcheap‚Äîso Mom and I decided to start a new tradition!‚Äù

He made a sudden ‚Äòwild man‚Äô yell, making us jump and giggle. Inside, the dusty cabin felt untouched for a decade. I dropped my bag, determined to claim the biggest room before Charlie could call dibs. I checked every door, but the last one had a rusty lock.


‚ÄúHunter, we‚Äôre not using that room,‚Äù Dad warned. ‚ÄúAuntie May said the floor was weak, so she closed it up last time she was here. I don‚Äôt want my nephews getting hurt.‚Äù


Nodding, I claimed the next biggest room, plopping my elephant on the bed like an astronaut staking the moon.

Morning brought the smell of bacon, maple syrup, eggs, and toast. I glanced at the now-still trees before joining Dad in the kitchen.


‚ÄúHey, Hunter, did you sleep good last night?‚Äù Dad asked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking today we go fishing. If the day warms up, maybe you and Charlie can take a dip!‚Äù


I grinned, scarfing eggs as Dad yelled down the hallway for Charlie. We grabbed our rods and headed to the wide, shallow creek. Charlie‚Äôs lucky hat worked magic‚Äîhe caught four trout. Dad snagged only a rubber bait for his collection. I caught a crawfish but didn‚Äôt mind, collecting shiny rocks until my pants sagged. Dad‚Äôs phone rang, startling us.


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just Mom,‚Äù he laughed, stepping away. ‚ÄúWe forgot to call her yesterday.‚Äù


Charlie rustled my hair. ‚ÄúAre you finding any cool rocks, Hunter?‚Äù
I showed him my multicolored haul. He pointed into the creek. ‚ÄúThat looks like a super unique one!‚Äù


He retrieved a triangular rock with a hole in the center, soaking his sleeve. I hugged him tightly, slipping it into my shirt pocket. As Dad talked, I noticed the tree bark shift, revealing the hole I remembered. I waved at Charlie, but it stopped. Uneasy, I pointed, and he questioned me‚Äîrocks? Ferns? Birds fleeing?


Finally, he guessed the tree. ‚ÄúHunter, it‚Äôs just a big ol‚Äô tree,‚Äù he said, crossing the creek. ‚ÄúIt even has a really cool hole in the side. Maybe we can make it into a little treehouse!‚Äù


The sky darkened as clouds hid the sun. Charlie climbed into the hole. ‚ÄúHunter, you should come over here! This would really make a cool tree hou‚Äî‚Äù


I froze as the bark sealed over him, blending perfectly, like the hole never existed. I grabbed his hat and ran to Dad, who was returning. Tears streaming, I shoved the hat at him, pointing across the creek.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter, where is Charlie?‚Äù Dad demanded, yelling into the woods.


After my nods and pointing, he ran across the creek. ‚ÄúCharlie, come back! This isn‚Äôt funny!‚Äù he shouted.


Ten minutes later, his voice hoarse, he returned. ‚ÄúHunter, wait here and watch for Charlie. I‚Äôm getting the emergency radio to contact search and rescue. Charlie wouldn‚Äôt go far; he doesn‚Äôt know these woods.‚Äù


He retrieved the radio, already talking. ‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam, we need people up here immediately. His name is Charlie, he‚Äôs 12 years old, he was with my other son, Hunter.‚Äù


The woman spoke, and Dad continued. ‚ÄúNo, ma‚Äôam, Hunter is non-verbal. He confirmed Charlie went into the woods. I need anyone you can send.‚Äù


‚ÄúThey‚Äôre on their way, about 20 minutes out?‚Äù he said, rubbing his neck. ‚ÄúOkay, thank you, goodbye.‚Äù


Dad sent me to flag down the police, who arrived soon after. I led them to the backyard, where Dad detailed Charlie‚Äôs disappearance‚Äîage, height, clothes, habits, insisting he wouldn‚Äôt wander off. He showed a photo from his wallet and led them across the creek. My heart sank‚Äîthe tree‚Äôs hole was wide open again, mocking me. Days of searching found nothing. Mom arrived, frantic, joining Dad and volunteers combing the woods. Two years later, we return annually on the day Charlie vanished, leaving the cabin and his room untouched. I find Mom in his bed, clutching his pillow. I feel Charlie‚Äôs energy but avoid the backyard‚Äôs ominous trees. Leaving the cabin, I glanced back with fading hope. In the tree‚Äôs bark, where the hole was, I saw Charlie‚Äôs face‚Äîeyes closed, peaceful. A key hung on a tattered rope around the trunk. I said nothing to my parents, who clung to hope. I clutch Charlie‚Äôs rock, his hat, and his memory, believing that key holds answers for next year, when I‚Äôll face the tree and unlock its secrets.",1,1757124872.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
1n9ntnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1n9ntnj/the_most_intense_body_aches_ive_ever_experienced/,The most intense body aches I‚Äôve ever experienced,"Ok, a bit of a long back story but I‚Äôm hoping someone can help‚Ä¶ 

35 year old female in BC Canada 
-History of migraines every 6-8 weeks, preceded by cluster headaches 
-History of severe motion sickness - I cannot be a passenger on a vehicle at all ever. Seems to be related to my migraines. A migraine triggers the worst dizziness and I am pretty much comatose with a puke bowl nearby for 12-20 hours 
-History of severe PMDD, and heavy/prolonged menstrual bleeding. Currently I am bleeding heavily upwards of 12 days per month, and spotting for an additional 5-10. So mostly bleeding more often than not. 
-History of unexplained bruising 
-History of restless legs syndrome 
-Mental health history of PTSD from childhood trauma, as well as generalized anxiety and depression 

Current medications:
30mg Mirtazipine 
100mg gabapentin 
.35 mg Norethindrone
100mg reddy-progesterone 
Multivitamin 
Magnesium 
Iron supplement 

So here‚Äôs the backstory. I finally got referred to a hematologist and a gynaecologist to try to figure out this bleeding. It has been going on for years. All lab work and endometrial biopsy came back normal. Gynaecologist started me on the mini pill and progesterone about 6 months ago. No change in my bleeding whatsoever. Previously I tried the mirena IUD which also did not change the bleeding. But in terms of medical diagnosis, I‚Äôm all clear and there‚Äôs no pinpointed reason why I‚Äôm bleeding all the time. But I am, and I subsequently feel like shit all the time. 

I also know that my nervous system is in overdrive/constant fight or flight from the PTSD and just general life stress (I have a lot of it). I feel like I‚Äôm always ‚Äúwired.‚Äù Add in a bit of depression and the bleeding issues and I just feel exhausted, depleted, sluggish, and awful most days. 

So eventually I decided to try seeing a different doctor because my GP basically shrugs her shoulders and isn‚Äôt doing anything to help me feel better. 

New doctor took a very thorough history and had some interesting theories. He thinks it‚Äôs possible that I am somewhat histamine intolerant and told me to try a low-histamine diet for a few weeks. He also sent for further lab work which I have not been able to do yet (just due to scheduling conflicts). Notably he is testing my thyroid, homocysteine, and testosterone. He also informed me that I may be somewhat gluten sensitive - my tissue transglutaminase ab was tested years ago and was 5.5 one time and 6.5 another time. My GP never brought this up to me at all. So he also recommended I cut out gluten as a trial to see if anything changes. The underlying reason he thinks I am histamine intolerant is because it can be linked to many of my symptoms such as headaches/dizziness, PMDD and menstrual irregularities, anxiety/mood disorder, and I had a severe case of cold urticaria that lasted for about 2 years and then went away. He said something about methylation and a build up of estrogen in my body which I didn‚Äôt fully understand. 

I am now on day 7 of a strict low histamine gluten free diet. I am also on day 5 of having a very mild head cold (slight sniffles and scratchy throat). No fever. But I have THE ABSOLUTE WORST BODY ACHES OF MY LIFE. It feels like every muscle is tense and aching from the top of my spine all the way down and around both hips and into my upper legs. I am in agony. I barely slept last night. I have tried a hot bath, heating pad, voltaren topical gel, and Tylenol (no nsaids due to the low histamine diet). 

Do you think the body aches could have to do with the diet change? Or just a random coincidence? I neeeeeed it to go away it is so painful I am tempted to go to ER. 

Previous to this low histamine and gluten free diet I ate pretty healthy in my opinion. Lots of protein and veggies. The main things I have cut out that were dietary staples for me are coffee, spinach, red and yellow peppers, yogurt, oat milk, occasionally whole grain toast or a granola bar, and peanut butter.
