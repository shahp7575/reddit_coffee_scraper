1nw27l2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1nw27l2/please_help_vote_for_my_stepdaughters_competition/,Please help vote for my stepdaughter's competition,"Hello everyone. I am wondering if you can help me. My stepdaughter (she is an adult but she lives with me) entered her puppy in a photo competition and I am wondering if you can help with votes.

I decided to make a post on here to ask for help because my stepdaughter has had a very rough time lately. She lost her dad, lost all three of her elderly dogs within weeks of each other, lost a baby (pregnancy) and after the baby she found out her husband was having an affair. She lives with me now and I have been very worried about her. I have tried everything I can think of to help her and I try to do things she likes to make her feel better such as movie nights and finding little coffee shops in our area and farmers markets. She got a puppy when she moved in with me (I love the puppy but when/if she wants to move out, she can keep him so he is hers.)

This photo competition for whatever reason seems to be the one thing she looks forward to and talks about during the day with any enthusiasm. I checked with the company to make sure posting here is okay and it is. It's with the company she has puppy insurance with and she won't win money or discounts or anything if she wins, it's just simply her puppy's picture in an advertisement. It doesn't matter to me what it is, I just desperately want to see her feel better again. She was always a kind, sunny person and I would like to see her feel that way again.

Her puppy's name is Reggie. Thank you for your help and I hope you have a good day whether you can vote or not.

Fast forward to many years, a lot of my friends are dealing with alcoholism, or health issues because of smoking and drinking early on. It’s impacting their professional as a well as personal lives. They have aged faster as well. 

It’s not like I never drink now, I do it once in a long while, but the battles I won during my college time, give me the confidence to keep winning against many habits. 

When we meet, they still want me to drink, but I still say no and have a black coffee instead. 

Whatever you do today, will set the tone of your future life. And you’ll never get such a time to set the foundation of your life because after college, you’ll become a 9 to 9 work horse. Leverage these years to upgrade yourself, learn, test your determination, don’t worry about petty things!

1nw261c,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nw261c/my_boyfriend_brought_a_fun_mystery_case_file_for/,"My boyfriend brought a fun mystery case file for us, but I think the victim is me","I should probably back up. My name is Cara Kent. I met Jake about four months ago right here on this subreddit. It started in the comments under some random thread, then moved to messages, and before I knew it we were talking every night. At first it was just easy, casual conversation, but then we started swapping playlists, book recommendations, dumb inside jokes. After a month, we decided to meet in person. I was nervous, but he was even better face to face. Charming, funny, never awkward for long. One thing led to another and for the last two months we’ve been dating.

Jake has this way of making everything feel like an adventure. He’s not the type who does dinner and a movie. Instead, he’ll plan things that catch me off guard in the best way, like midnight drives, or setting up a rooftop picnic, or showing up with tickets to something I’ve never heard of. I thought the case file was just another one of those ideas. He walked in with this plain brown folder tucked under his arm and a grin on his face, like he couldn’t wait to see my reaction. 

He said, “We’re solving a murder tonight.” 

He set the folder down on my coffee table like it was a board game. I remember laughing and asking him if this was one of those mystery kits you see ads for. He nodded and leaned back against the couch with that smug half-smile he does when he thinks he’s being clever.

I opened the folder and there was a cover sheet that looked like an official police report. The title said **CASE BRIEF** in block letters. It listed out the basics like the victim, location, time of death.

The name jumped out at me right away: Clara Kane.

It felt weird, seeing those initials, C.K. Same as mine. I said it out loud and pointed at the page. 

“Seriously though, Clara Kane, Cara Kent. That’s a little too on the nose.”

Jake leaned over, brushed my hair back from my neck, and kissed the spot just below my ear like he always does when he wants to distract me. 

“Weird coincidence,” he murmured, and then stole another kiss before I could argue. I laughed and shoved him off, but he just smirked, like the file was some inside joke only he got.

I asked him, half teasing, “Where do you even get these ideas? Who wakes up and thinks, hey, let’s solve a murder on date night?”

He tipped his glass of wine toward me and said, “I can’t give away all my secrets. What would you have left to figure out about me?” 

His tone was playful, but it carried that same confident edge he always had, like he was three steps ahead in every conversation.

We ended up moving onto the floor with the file spread out between us, the bottle of wine in easy reach. I remember looking at him then, trying to explain him to myself. Dark hair, strong jaw, a birthmark above his bellybutton that I’d always loved, even though he joked it looked like a smudge. He has this way of holding your gaze that makes it feel like he’s reading you, word by word.

Jake freelances as a website developer, mostly for clients overseas. He likes that it lets him pick his own hours. I liked it too. It meant he could disappear in the middle of the day and show up outside my office with coffee, or take off with me on a random Tuesday night drive. His life seemed flexible, unpinned, and I think that was part of what drew me in.

Jake read out the case brief loud in this over-dramatic detective voice that made me snort into my glass of wine.

* **Victim:** Clara Kane
* **Age:** 27
* **Sex:** Female
* **Height:** 5’6” (167 cm)
* **Weight:** 132 lbs (60 kg)
* **Hair:** Brown (brunette)
* **Eyes:** Hazel
* **Occupation:** Marketing associate, employed at a mid-sized advertising firm
* **Distinguishing Marks:** Small mole under left collarbone
* **Residence:** Apartment in Midtown
* **Marital Status:** Single, lived alone
* **Criminal Record:** None

I blinked. “Wait…that’s literally me. Like, exactly me.”

Jake grinned, clearly enjoying himself. “You? No. You’re way cuter than Clara Kane.” He leaned over, pressed his lips to my neck again, and I swatted him away. “Come on, it’s just character building. Every good story needs a believable victim.”

I laughed, but my stomach did this little twist I couldn’t shake. Same initials. Same age. Same job. Same hair color. Even the height matched.

“Seriously though,” I said, pointing at the page, “this is a little creepy. Did you make this yourself to scare me? Because if you did, it’s working.”

Jake gave me a hearty laugh. “Weird coincidence, but I am starting to love this.” Then, like always, he softened the moment by kissing my cheek and brushing his thumb along my jaw. He had that way of making me forget what I was saying, even when I was trying to stay annoyed.

I set the page down and pulled the next one closer. **AUTOPSY REPORT**. Typed out neat and clinical, like something pulled from a real coroner’s office. I skimmed until my eyes landed on the part that made me pause.

“Last meal: hamburger, French fries, coffee.”

I froze. That’s my go-to order at the diner near my apartment. Always. Right down to the coffee, even at night.

I laughed nervously. “Okay, now this is spooky. That’s literally my exact meal. You’re not slick, Jake.”

He just shrugged, sipping his wine. “Or maybe you just have classic taste.” He said it so easily, so casually, like it was nothing.

But sitting there on the floor, the file spread out between us, his smirk lingering as I tried to play it cool, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this was all a little too pointed.

We spent the next little while just talking while flipping through the folder. I told him about my week at work, the endless campaigns, clients changing their minds every five minutes. Jake laughed at my rants, teasing me about how “fun” marketing must be, comparing it to the excitement of being dead like Clara Kane. I rolled my eyes and jabbed him in the shoulder. 

“Ha ha. Very funny. I’m glad murder is more interesting than my life.”

He leaned closer and whispered with that same mischievous grin, “Maybe Clara had a better boyfriend than you. Someone who helped her take more makeout breaks?” I groaned, but I couldn’t help laughing. He always had this way of keeping the conversation playful, even when it veered into the weird or the morbid.

Then I picked up the next section: **Crime Scene Photos**.

The first images were grainy black-and-white prints, probably copied and resized a few times. An apartment bedroom. A messy desk with papers scattered across it. The front door slightly ajar. At first, I didn’t think much of it. Jake leaned over and whispered something dumb about “detective angles” while ruffling through the folder. I tried to focus on the photos, but then my eyes landed on one shot of a bedroom corner.

It had a blanket with a pattern that made me stop. The exact blanket I had folded at the foot of my own bed this morning. I froze, my chest tightening.

I looked up at him, but he just shrugged casually. “Generic stock photos. Probably from some website.”

I wanted to believe him, I really did. I laughed nervously and told myself it was just a coincidence. But that blanket? It was mine.

Next, I flipped to the Inventory Log. It was just a typed list of Clara Kane’s belongings.

Jake leaned over my shoulder and pointed at a few items. “See, wallet’s intact. Keys all accounted for. The laptop looks like it hasn’t been touched. Jewelry’s in the usual spots. Yada yada yada.” He smirked, like he was narrating a mystery TV show for my amusement.

I paused at the last two entries. “So the phone’s missing? And the diary’s missing too?” I said it jokingly, but my heart seemed to shrink.

Jake shrugged again. “Crime scene realities. Not everything makes sense at first glance. Keeps it interesting.” Then he reached out and brushed my hand lightly.

I laughed and nudged him. “I know you have made it. You’re obsessed with details.” I picked up the diary line and smirked. “I guess Clara kept her thoughts safe in a diary too, huh?”

He laughed. “Some people need a hobby.”

I set it down without thinking much more of it, but that little sinking feeling wouldn’t quite go away.

I pulled out the next set of pages: **Newspaper Clippings**. They were old, slightly yellowed at the edges, printed from various sources. They did not seem like random print outs. They seemed like real news clippings. 

The first one was dated 2019. Headline: “Caroline Kepler Found Dead in Her Home.” Short article, clinical. No details about how she died, just that her body was discovered by a neighbor and the police were investigating. Reading it, I noticed the age. 27. Dark hair. Average build. My heart kept sinking, per usual, but I told myself it was a coincidence.

The second clipping was from 2022: “Christina Kowalski Missing; Last Seen at Midtown Cafe.” This one mentioned small details about her routines, her favorite café. It could have been anyone, right? Still, I felt a prickle of unease.

The third, from 2024, was even stranger: “Charlotte Kearns, Victim of Tragic Fall.” The description included brown hair, height five-six, weight that lined up almost exactly with mine. I laughed nervously and nudged Jake. “Okay three people, same initials…that’s a bit much, isn’t it?”

He leaned over and sipped his wine, grinning. “Coincidences happen. You’ll see, there’s nothing to worry about.”

I flipped to the fourth clipping. Headline: “Local Woman Found Dead.” My eyes immediately caught the date: December 25, 2025.

I froze. December. That’s three months from now. My pulse quickened, and a cold knot formed in my stomach. Does that mean this hasn’t happened yet? Is this supposed to be our victim?

I looked up at Jake, trying to gauge if he was joking or just as casual as ever, but he was leaning back, sipping his wine like nothing was unusual. I forced a laugh and set the paper aside, but I couldn’t shake the thought. Something about that date made my skin prick.

I tucked the clipping back into the folder, deciding not to read further. I didn’t know why, but part of me knew that whatever the article said, I wasn’t ready to see it yet.

Jake noticed my pause and leaned in. “Everything okay?” he asked, raising his eyebrows.

I forced a laugh. “Yeah, yeah, just…coincidences,” I said, but my voice sounded hollow, even to me.

I tried to put the papers down, but I couldn’t. Each clipping now felt like pieces of a puzzle I didn’t want to solve. The initials, the jobs, the age, the hair color, all of it lining up. I felt like I was staring at a reflection that didn’t belong in my life yet somehow already knew it.

When I got to the last piece of evidence in the folder, it wasn’t another clipping or photo. It was a single scanned page. At first, I didn’t even understand what I was looking at. It was lined paper, torn from the middle of a diary.

And then my eyes focused, and my whole body went cold.

It was my diary. Not just any diary page. I knew the exact entry, the day, the little doodle I’d drawn in the corner. I had written that page two weeks ago. I was staring at my own handwriting.

My breath hitched. My hand trembled as I held the paper up to the light. “Jake,” I said, my voice suddenly thin. “How did you find this?”

He smiled at first, like he thought I was playing along. “What do you mean? It’s just part of the kit,” he said lightly.

“No,” I snapped. “This isn’t some prop. This is mine. This is my diary. Nobody even knows where I keep it. It’s hidden.”

He blinked at me, confused. “Wait. What?”

I shoved the page at him. “Look at this. This is my handwriting. This is my entry from two weeks ago. How did this get here?”

He leaned forward, the playful look fading from his face. “Cara, I swear to you, I have no idea. I bought this case file from a website. It’s supposed to be one of those immersive mystery games. I can show you the receipt. I literally ordered it last week.”

But I wasn’t listening to him. I looked at the page. 

My original entry had been scribbled in frustration after a terrible day at work. I had slammed my laptop shut, kicked off my shoes, and just dumped my thoughts onto the page:

“I can’t stand today. Everything went wrong. I wonder if I went missing, would anyone even care?”

It had been a throwaway thought, the kind you don’t even expect anyone to read. Just a moment of private despair I never meant to share.

But my eyes were drawn down the scanned page, and then I saw it. Beneath my words, in thick, jagged red ink, someone had scrawled four words that weren’t mine:

“I don’t think so.”

Just four words. But it was like ice water poured down my spine.

I could feel my heart hammering in my throat. I dropped the page onto the floor and stood up. “This isn’t funny, Jake. This isn’t a game. How did you get this?”

He stood too, hands out in a calming gesture. “Cara, I’m telling you, I didn’t do this. I thought this was just a fun kit for us to solve together. Look, look.” He dug into his phone, fumbling to pull up something. “Here. This is the site. This is the order confirmation. I ordered it last week. It came in the mail yesterday. I didn’t know what was in it. I thought it would be fun.”

I stared at his phone, the email on the screen, but my mind wasn’t processing. My apartment keys. My diary. My handwriting. My secret thought. No one had been in my apartment. No one even knew where I kept that journal. Not my mother. Not my friends. Not even Jake.

My voice shook. “I knew it was my blanket, earlier, and now my diary? Have you ever been here when I wasn’t home?”

He looked wounded. “Cara. Come on. I’ve never been here without you. I swear.”

But it was like the room tilted. All the little details about him that I’d brushed off before suddenly came back to me. I knew he had no coworkers to vouch for him, no friends he’d ever introduced me to. I’d been to his place, sure, but it was always immaculate and empty, like a hotel room.

I stared at him, my throat dry. “Jake, if you didn’t do this, then who did?”

He reached for my hand, but I pulled it back. The warmth I’d always felt from his touch now felt foreign.

“I don’t know,” he said quietly. “But you have to believe me. I wouldn’t do this to you. Someone must have…” He trailed off, searching for words.

“Someone must have what? Broken into my apartment? Clicked pictures of my blanket? Found my diary? Stalked me and put details into a case file you ordered?” My voice cracked. “Do you even hear how insane that sounds?”

He flinched, then ran a hand through his hair. “I know it sounds crazy. But I’m not lying. Please, Cara. Look at me. I’m not lying.”

I stared at him. I wanted to believe him. I really did. But nothing made sense. If he wasn’t behind this, then who else knew so much about me? Who else would orchestrate something like this?

My mind raced back over every night we’d spent together, every time I’d told him something personal, every time I’d left a window cracked or a door unlocked. It all felt suddenly unsafe.

I whispered, “I don’t even know you.”

He stepped closer, his voice low and steady now. “You do know me. This isn’t me. I swear on my life. Someone is messing with us.”

But his words washed over me like static. Because deep down, I realized I had no proof either way. He could be telling the truth. Or he could be lying as easily as breathing.

I looked at Jake, my hands still trembling from the diary page. “Whatever this is,” I said, my voice shaking, “if it’s some kind of prank, it’s gone too far. And if it isn’t, then we need to do something.”

He nodded slowly, his expression serious. “You’re right. I’ll go home, track down the seller, figure out who made this case file. I’ll get answers for you, Cara. I promise.”

I wanted to believe him, but my heart raced. He reached for me, but I pulled back instinctively. He sighed, a mix of frustration and concern in his eyes. “You need some space,” he said softly. “Just a little time to process all of this. I didn’t want tonight to be like this. I wanted it to be fun.”

I couldn’t even look at him. My voice was all but a whisper, I said, “I…I need a minute.”

He nodded, lingering for a moment, like he wanted to hold me close but understood. Then he left. His footsteps faded down the hall. Part of me wanted to scream after him, to beg him to stay, but I couldn’t. The room felt empty and heavy the second he was gone.

I slumped onto the couch, my hands gripping my head. The case file wasn’t on the table. I assumed he had taken it with him. Maybe he really would track this down. 

Maybe.

Then I got up to go back to my room, and that’s when I noticed it on the floor, next to the table. One page had been left behind. My heart jumped. I picked it up.

It was the newspaper clipping from the pile that I hadn’t read. Dated December 25, 2025.

The headline: “Local Woman Found Dead.”

I skimmed the text in disbelief. Every detail matched me: my height, my build, my hair color, even my apartment description. And then the kicker.

The name. My name. Cara Kent.

She had been found strangled in her room. No forced entry. Nothing stolen. Everything detailed with exact precision.

I dropped the clipping. My hands were shaking so violently I could barely pick up my phone. I tried calling Jake. No answer. Not even voicemail.

Panic clawed at my chest. Was this left behind on purpose? Did he mean for me to see this? Or had it been placed here by someone else entirely?

I sat on the floor, clutching the newspaper like it was a lifeline and a curse at the same time. The worst part? It seemed real. Every word. Every detail. I couldn’t tell what was staged and what wasn’t.

I couldn’t breathe. I didn’t know who to trust. I didn’t know what was real. And Jake? Jake had vanished.

I’m now writing this because I’m terrified. I don’t know whom to trust anymore. It’s been three days since Jake left with the case file. He said he’d get answers, but his phone is dead now. No messages, no replies. He’s just gone.

I’ve been sitting in my apartment with the lights on, curtains closed, every lock bolted. I still feel like someone’s watching me. I keep checking the peephole, but the hallway is empty. Every sound outside makes me jump. I barely eat. I don’t sleep. When I close my eyes, I see that page.

The article from December 25th is still here. I don’t even know how it ended up on my table. My name. My address. The date. My death. Strangled. No forced entry. It’s all printed like it already happened. Like I’m reading an obituary written in advance.

I’ve read it so many times my hands have smudged the ink. My stomach feels like lead. I keep thinking about the diary page with the red scrawl. Whoever wrote that knows me. Knows my handwriting. Knows my life. I tried to find my diary after that. I’ve turned my apartment upside down. Every drawer, every box, every bag. It’s gone. Stolen. Someone has been in my home.

I don’t know if Jake did this or if someone else planted it here to break me. I want to believe him. I want to believe he was just trying to surprise me. But every detail of him, every laugh, every quiet smile now feels like a lie I swallowed whole. I don’t know who he really is.

Two nights ago, I went to his apartment. The door was locked, lights off. I knocked until my knuckles ached but no one answered. The hallway felt too quiet, like the whole building was holding its breath. I tracked down the building’s super, hoping maybe Jake had just skipped town, but he told me he hadn’t seen Jake in some time. He said the rent was paid but the place was empty.

I’m thinking of going to the police next. But what do I even tell them? That a man I’ve been dating gave me a case file predicting my own murder? That someone has stolen my diary and planted my handwriting in a fake crime scene? With no sign of forced entry, no proof of a break-in, I’m terrified they’ll chalk it up to paranoia.

I’m so scared. I’m scared to leave. I’m scared to stay. I’m scared of my own apartment now. My heart doesn’t stop racing. I feel like I’m waiting for something to happen and I don’t know what.

If anything happens to me on Christmas, I want this here. I want someone to know.",2,1759407479.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1nw259v,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausjobs/comments/1nw259v/turns_out_firing_your_most_important_engineer/,"Turns out, firing your most important engineer over a small raise can be a very costly mistake.","I thought I'd share this story with you, maybe it will give someone a bit of hope or at least make them laugh a little.

I was a senior software engineer at a fairly well-known tech company for about 7 years. Without getting into too many details, the product was in the cloud storage space, something like Box or Google Drive. A core part of the system was a complex distributed ledger system to keep data consistent across all servers. I built this system from scratch, and for various reasons, I was the sole developer responsible for its maintenance because management never saw the need to build a full team for it.

I knew that several other senior engineers in the company were making about 15% more than me, so I asked for a raise to match their salary. The answer was a firm 'no.' So, I decided to adjust my effort to match my pay. I stopped working extra hours, became stricter with my schedule, and pretty much ignored the whole 'core hours' thing.

About six months ago, a new head of engineering came in. The first thing he did was fire my manager, so I started reporting directly to him. In one of our first meetings, he said he had 'heard things' about me not sticking to a 9-to-5 schedule. I confirmed this was true and explained my reasons. A few weeks after that call, he fired me. When I asked why, he told me my HR file was marked for 'insubordination,' which entitled me to a severance package.

Recently, I was having coffee with an old colleague who still works there. He told me that the new manager and the VP he brought in are both gone. Apparently, a big reason is that they now have a team of 5 engineers trying to do my old job. And since they're still paying my severance, they're effectively paying the salaries of 6 people to do what I used to do alone. And the best part? The platform is now notoriously unstable, they've started losing major clients, and apparently, the board is not happy at all.

And the funniest part? All this chaos could have been avoided if they had just approved that simple 15% raise.

Anyway, it just goes to show you that karma can be very real sometimes. I honestly had a good laugh when I heard the news!",2,1759407423.0,ausjobs,0,1.0,False
1nw2504,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nw2504,"Jotting down thoughts, Discord server updates/recap. What might be good for your heart🦩Might not be good for my head (guess what song this is from and if you do then you should join the Discord server.) Your music taste must enjoy Lorna Shore, Sleep Token, and AngelMaker style of genre of music.","This Discord server is also for introverts, NEETs, and people with social anxiety looking for a very quiet and still Discord server for the vast majority of the time.

I thought I should give a general idea about what the Discord server is looking for because this Discord server is also a way to help me make online friends off of Reddit, I also want to give a recap/some updates about the Discord server before I delete the mobile app off my phone in a day or two and take a break from Reddit (I don't know when I'll be back and I really can't answer that when I'll be back. I'm not even certain that I will redownload the app on my mobile phone again) Keep a reminder that I will not be turning off my chat request till another 24 hours or 42 hours around there then  you can just send me a chat request until these hours appear on the post when I'll be turning off my chat requests.

What I'm seeking further offline off of Reddit when I delete the app off my phone, keep a reminder that I'm not asking for offline Redditors to keep me company for those 24 or 42 hours that I will be online, I don't currently and I'll never currently seek something like that, that would do more harm than good That isn't subject to change either, I'll never want temporary contacts, just to make me feel a sense of false love from friendship, I want the connection to be real and not so much falsified of it all.

However this is important to understand that I'm simply and truthfully not looking for a quick and easy temporary contact within those 24 or 42 hours, I'm also just not looking for someone to message me for 24 and 42 hours then up and leave. The type of  connections that want to send me a chat request, understand that I'm looking for someone that is interested in texting me bya day-by-day basis and have the time to send a handful or a lot of text messages throughout the day on Discord (obviously everyone here knows that I don't do voice calls and I randomly send voice clips when I get the motivation to send them, and I don't want to be awkward, distracting, and embarrassing and embarrass myself on a video phone call instead.)

I should also state that the kind of person I am that I do best with is connecting with people through expressive text messages and expressive text messages from Redditors that are able to have expressive text messages through a lot of collective thoughts and to be able to have a lot of random conversations. Most of the days I'm just spending my life being in and out of being dissociative, listening to the beat and the vibe of the music that I get lost in the expressive art of music.

I excel in conversations that are an expressive art of emotional connection and emotional bonding with friends that are all related to that bonding with music or hyper-fixations of hobbies.

I'm also only seeking online friendships currently and I'm not interested in meeting anyone in real life this year due to my living conditions and my living conditions will change within a year or two from now.

Well enough of that and let's just go to another subject about the recap for the Discord server and updates about the Discord server before I make my last Discord promotion posts.

Updates on the Discord server.

Recap and new things about the Discord server and how the Discord server plays Skyrim.

You just might think, ""You really think this Discord server is okay for people with social anxiety with 60 people in the Discord server"" (I'm sure the Discord server will either rise or decrease when I say this, haha.) However, what makes you think 60 people in the Discord server are chatting up a storm? That's so inaccurately false, haha.

Yeah, well, this Discord server is heavily music-based, which means people with social anxiety will only check the notifications for the hashtags that are related to the music hashtags and will only text in the general text when the energy/vibes are right. Which is what is happening in the Discord server; nobody barely texts in the general chat hashtags, and obviously that makes sense, it being a Discord server that is heavily catering to the NEETs, introverts, and people with social anxiety.

That's how I am as well; I chat when I feel the energy, I'm feeling a break from the social anxiety, and I'm feeling chatty. I will say, speaking of social anxiety, introduction posts aren't required to chat/post amongst the Discord server members. However, if you feel the need to make an introduction post, then you can do that by doing what you normally post as an introduction post, as you would here on this subreddit.

Speaking of social anxiety, we're looking to help cure some of the sadness with cute cat pictures. Who here has cat pictures or cat videos that can help with the pet hashtag on the Discord server? If you don't have cats, then whatever pets you have or own work; that even includes if you have a pet gecko or salamander. You can also add to the spook factor if you get a lot of crows or ravens in your backyard for added vibes/coolness to the Discord server as well. I'm just trying to make this a non-toxic space for all and also trying to make friends that vibe with me.

Examples could be.

Jerry handmade inspired bracelets but without using the Sleep Token logo! However, we do have safety measures for everyone to follow to feel safe. Redditors that join this Discord server for this purpose must be able to show proof either by a piece of paper of their PayPal and the item next to the item or, if the person doesn't have proof of reviews from a retail website where you can sell your goods, by the item itself.

An example of that would be eBay reviews. I'm also trying to see if I can have a friend help me with getting animated flamingo stickers for Sleep Token vibes, and I will have to see what can be done for Lorna Shore. I'm not certain what animated emotes can be used for Lorna Shore. Maybe someone could chime in with ideas!

I'm also allowing people in the introduction post to post if they feel comfortable posting about looking for people to play video games with. I know Discord automatically has a connection feature for Steam and PlayStation profiles, but that doesn't help others/give a cue to Discord users to know if you want people to play with you or not.

I also don't think Nintendo will be interested in allowing a Discord connection option, which sucks.

Who knows, maybe it's a copyright issue with Nintendo why there can't be a Discord connection option to share your Nintendo code for others to add; that's such a shame/bummer!

Which I wanted to bring up about gaming, since it's already a spooky season, and Halloween will be right around the corner eventually and Redditors are probably wondering. Since my last posts, it's obvious enough that I'm seeking an 85 percent connection and spent the majority of that time online only rather than in person because of personal conflicts with the living conditions that I'm in right now that will change in a year or possibly in two years, and you can read more in the second pinned post, as that would explain it in more detail than bringing this post out way longer than it is right now haha. However, let's talk about what I'm talking about with friends and doing something on the arrival of Halloween.


Obviously, microphones can be muted; of course, I will mute mine. I can tell you right now I can't multitask, as you've gathered from my previous posts that were previously deleted after being uploaded for a while. I can't multitask, and I get easily distracted if I try multitasking. I also don't think anybody wants to hear their friend go, 'Uh...wait, let me open a browser tab, and let me look this up, and oh wait, I need to go back on what my friend said. What was that?'

Uh...then figures out what to say afterwards, while getting back on track, which is no thanks, and I don't expect anyone to get on the microphone anyways with social anxiety.

However, I'm looking to see if a friend on Halloween could start a screen share on Discord or even start a YouTube stream with either a Silent Hill game or a Devil May Cry game, and as is obviously no surprise, my other favorite franchise is SEGA, and I mean, how obvious is that? It would be nice to sip on a coffee and text about whatever you feel like texting about, and we don't have to text about every single cutscene that hits the game unless you find that completely necessary.

We don't really have to do that, and I don't find that necessary unless the other person thinks that's necessary. We can just get virtually cozy and text about whatever while I enjoy the stream, and yeah, we can both agree on a game that you would enjoy double screen sharing.

We could even take a break, screen share on Discord my YT music shuffle playlist that I created, and just relax on Discord listening to music for an hour or longer than an hour, maybe an hour and a half, or maybe music/texting about whatever you feel like the topic should be for the evening/night.

That would be fine, and also for game streams. I normally enjoy watching for three or four hours on screen share or YT stream, whereas music playlist shuffle screen sharing with my friends for an hour or near/close to an hour and a half is perfect because I end up dozing off and falling asleep because I'm so relaxed, LMFAO. My ex-friend/ex-partner did this with me until he didn't like doing that with me anymore, and yeah, we used to do this a lot, and this is something that almost happened once. I was so relaxed with the shuffle playlist stream/chatting away that I ended up getting very sleepy/tired and dozed off for a few minutes, haha.

The friends that I've curiously asked how autistic I sound in the past in text messages have always replied, ""You sound very autistic, and it's very noticeable in your text messages."" However, I do understand how mentally and emotionally draining it is for a non-neurodivergent to deal with someone very autistic, and you can read more on my pinned posts, but this is what happened to my ex-friend/ex-partner: he couldn't deal with my very autistic needs and partner. He thought he would be okay dating someone very autistic but found out a month later that this friendship/relationship was something he didn't want to continue doing. However, back on the energy drinks.

What my friend will do is go to the gas station and send me a picture of what energy drinks are at the gas station, and I select one. I'm a huge fan of Celsius even though SOME of their products taste nasty, and there are some Celsius products that taste cool/awesome though! Alani is another favorite of mine for energy drinks, and after we pick out energy drinks, we would either start screen sharing music or a video game for a while. I just think that's fun, and if you think this is weird or too strange. Well, I can't tell you how many times that my autistic self was/were way too overwhelming for people to deal with.

Which I should make a loud and clear statement here: just because there are 60 people in the Discord server (I don't look at the number often, so this could be inaccurate right now.) I only have about 8 contacts on my friend lists; that's because I don't and I will never individually message someone on the Discord server unless the person starts the conversation first, rather than from the posts the Redditor read on my posts or a comment the Redditor read on my profile.


Where will you be since you're deleting the Reddit app from your mobile phone, anywhere else besides Discord? Telegram or Signal?

I don't know that answer, currently the only app I've on my phone is Discord and I don't know if I'll get a text messaging app to text my friends or partner if I become burnt out of Discord and only will have the Discord app on my Windows desktop to check the notifications if something pops up from the Discord server, if this happens I will make an update somewhere on the appropriate hashtag on the Discord server itself.

However for now, the Discord app is on my phone and I'm just tending to the Discord server, occasionally texting with friends inside the Discord server (which is almost always Lorna Shore news and posting cat pictures or videos.) and seeing if anyone new messages me when joining the Discord server if there is an interest in friendship. I just wait for the friendship to come to me, as I'm getting tired of looking for friendship, and I'm finding that I'm getting that autistic burnout and feeling overstimulated by everything/needing a break.

Yeah I can say that, from what I can gather how people are enjoying this Discord server, a lot of people have felt relaxed in this Discord server (in the past we had some drama happen in the Discord server, which I will not bring there and you can read my highly important pinned post, obviously there is a reason why those post are pinned to begin with.) However, other than that people enjoy how relaxed this Discord server is. Many people just wait to post band recommendations, lyrics videos, anything music related and cute pictures of people's pets, and sometimes a random bird photo will drop for people that want to take pictures of wildlife animals from their backyard or someone decided to post a random a random picture of a bird and decided to drop it there, which is fine if that's what people want to do. Adding the cuteness factor to the Discord server is what we want and, as I previously stated already, we need to add the spook factor by adding cute crows and ravens from your backyard!

What do friends think or partners think of matching phone cases and band stickers? Obviously the stickers will be Lorna Shore and Sleep Token obviously, haha. I'm also talking about if a friend or a partner of mine would enjoy matching a teal phone case or a cherry pattern phone case design to match, I think that's a cute idea! However, I know it's probably very hard to get a phone case because of very old phone models and one of my friends told me that TeePublic and Redbubble aren't shipping internationally anymore, which sucks! Speaking of international, I don't care if you're international! Even if I'm from the U.S. and if you've legitimate REAL cool/awesome vibes, then I want to get to know you!

This is how the Discord server owner plays Skyrim.

Skyrim updates.

The only reason why I joined Dawnguard was because I don't know what was up with my game, but who doesn't on a not modded Skyrim game? You never know what kind of problems you're going to run into in Skyrim with the hilarious and funny glitches. However, this seemed interesting to me, and I don't even know why that kept on happening to me at a very high chance rate, but almost 70 percent of the time I would fast travel. The vampires would be after me constantly, and I was annoyed.

What even got worse was a few vampires ruined some NPC quests I wanted to complete, so I'm taking my vengeance out on them for their annoyance, haha. However, this gave me the chance to see if I enjoyed the crossbow anyways, because when I played Skyrim on a console I didn't have any more, and obviously the save file was gone. My favorite style was blocking and using the Mace of Molag Bal.

However, using a crossbow is very deadly, and surprisingly, I'm very good at using a crossbow. Back when I played Skyrim on the console that I used to know, I just had the basic copy of Skyrim, nothing fancy and no special edition. However, that is different now since I play on the PS4. I'm also a Stormcloak, obviously, because I can't stand annoying politics where there are a bunch of NPCs talking about high praise for the Imperials, and it's just getting me to think, ""You're about as annoying as Nazeem,"" and every single time I go to Whiterun, here he goes with his famous Cloud District post. I've never seen an NPC be as annoying as a Stormcloak, though. However, it's no wonder why people want to kill Nazeem; he's literally annoying.

I want to see how much I can handicap myself this time around without using double enchantments on my gear but a single enchantment on my gear with my newry, and I'll also not be using any elemental protection to further handicap me, haha. I'm also on adept combat level mode because I think that's all the stress level I want to give myself while mildly handicapping myself on the game, and I don't think I want to change the combat level difficulty.

I simply and truthfully think the only way I'm going to survive a Falmer cave is if I have a tank follower with high experience in block, heavy gear, and archery to back me up. This is going to create a very stressful environment; however, I never handicapped myself like this on Skyrim, as I've always done double enchantments on my gear and my jewelry. I've also never done any elemental protection on my gear before, and I never did a 1-enchantment handicap on my gear and my jewelry.

What are you looking for in the Discord server? Are you looking for offline Redditors to help you with the Discord server? As a Discord owner do you need any assistance with anything that a offline Redditor can help you with? We also need to know what the Discord server icon is about and the Discord server title, what is that about?

Who is that on the Discord server icon? That's Will Ramos excited to eat something that made him pass out, damn the food must've been THAT good. I may/might change the Discord server's icon to Will Ramos's sigil name that's posted on my Reddit page (not my image, and I don't claim it's my image.) Will Ramos posted that on his social media when FB allowed you to click on images and save them without logging in. However, I'm having issues with that now, and oddly, I can't look at reels anymore without logging in. That's why I'm asking for others to help post Lorna Shore and Sleep Token newsfeeds on the correct hashtags on the Discord server. We're also looking for Discord members that want to occasionally post Lorna Shore and Sleep Token memes, which are welcomed in the correct hashtags to be posted. Obviously the Discord title name is obviously taken from a Lorna Shore song lyric, which most of the Redditors reading this probably expected just as much as that, haha.

The mountain air was sharp and thin, biting at the lungs with every breath. Snow crunched beneath the weight of his bare feet as Kuroki Gensai shifted through another kata, his frame moving with the weightless precision of a man who had ground every gesture down to its purest form. His muscles, scar-etched and corded with years of brutal discipline, rose and fell in silence as he cut through the stillness of dawn.



The wind whispered through the pines. He ignored it.



Then a hum. Mechanical. Out of place in the natural silence.

Kuroki gensai's  head tilted slightly. His eyes, dark and unflinching, followed the noise.



Above him, against the gray-blue sky, a black shape descended—a drone, its rotors buzzing like the wings of some oversized hornet. It hovered with clinical patience, the kind of machine sent with purpose, not curiosity. From its belly, something dropped.



An envelope, bound in wax, landed lightly in the snow at his feet.



For a long moment, he did not move. His breath was steady, steaming in the cold, the way of a man who had long ago mastered stillness. Then, with a slow bend at the waist, Kuroki picked it up. The paper was cold, brittle from the mountain chill, but heavy with something unseen.



He broke the seal.



The lines of his face, carved deep by age and struggle, did not change as his eyes moved across the words. Only the faintest shadow touched him—a solemn weight slipping behind his expressionless mask.



The wind carried the last note of the drone’s retreat into silence.



Kuroki folded the letter with deliberate care and slid it inside his gi. He looked out over the mountain’s edge, where the clouds gathered like an endless battlefield. It would seem like once again the world would crave more bloodshed. 



  
Italy, 2025 

 In the hills above Florence, beyond the reach of satellites or satellites' masters, stood a villa that did not appear on any map.Not even as a shadow.Not even as a rumor.The road to it was paved in imported black stone that seemed to drink the light. It wound through groves of genetically engineered olive trees, symmetrical and silent. The gates—twenty feet high, matte black, forged from submarine steel—Vaulted ceilings framed by frescoes painted by men whose signatures had been erased from history. Silk curtains thick enough to stop bullets. Floors polished to mirror shine. No gold in sight—too vulgar. The wealth here was in silence, in stillness, in the air itself, which smelled faintly of orange blossom and old paper.On the second floor, behind six biometric checkpoints, a man stood barefoot on a Persian rug woven in the 14th century.He was known only as Matteo Bellandi. Matteo was seventy-eight.though He did not look it.His frame was lean but regal, every movement deliberate, economical. He wore cream-colored slacks and a hand-stitched Neapolitan blazer over a black silk shirt, unbuttoned at the throat. No jewelry. No watch. His skin was the color of antique bronze. Hair pure white, thick, combed back like a war general preparing for a final campaign. His eyes were black—not brown, not hazel, but obsidian—and impossibly still.A servant approached with a silver tray holding a porcelain demitasse. Matteo nodded.The servant bowed—lower than necessary—and vanished behind one of the silent-moving walls.Matteo sipped. The coffee had been harvested from a private hillside in Yemen, dried in the stomachs of civets fed only saffron and dates, brewed through spring water drawn from an aquifer below Mt. Fuji. It was perfect. Because everything in this villa was perfect. He stepped into the adjacent room.The Round Room.It was not a circle of equals.Thirteen seats formed a perfect ring, but one was higher. His.Each seat was sculpted from black Carrara marble, inlaid with ancient obsidian from the Mayan temples. The air was cool, dry, and smelled faintly of vetiver and blood ink.One by one, the others arrived.A Chinese industrialist with teeth made of synthetic diamond.A Moroccan arms dealer in flowing white robes and lambskin slippers.A Balkan billionaire wearing the same suit as Matteo—same tailor, different posture.A Brazilian woman with fire-opal nails, rumored to have drowned her predecessor in a hydrotherapy pool.They spoke in murmurs. French, Russian, Urdu, Japanese. But when Matteo entered, the room fell into silence.He sat.And without raising his voice, said:""It begins.""Below the villa, in what appeared to be a wine cellar but was in fact a tactical crypt, a team of masked agents activated a system unseen since the last Tournament.Each invitation was handwritten—never printed. The parchment was grown in a hydroponic lab. The ink was mixed with crushed pearls and clotted blood. Each envelope bore a seal in black wax pressed with a signet forged from meteorite.Thirty-two envelopes. Thirty-two destinies.They left the villa in velvet cases, loaded into armored Bentleys and nondescript jets, carried by emissaries who swore oaths in twelve languages. Some rode horseback through valleys. Some dived into frozen rivers to reach submarines. One was stitched into the chest cavity of a mute courier, who arrived at the shores of Lagos with sutures still weeping.Each recipient knew what it meant.Each recipient said yes.They always said yes.

What might be good for your heart🦩Might not be good for my head (guess what song this is from and if you do then you should join the Discord server.) Your music taste must enjoy Lorna Shore, Sleep Token, and AngelMaker style of genre of music.","This Discord server is also for introverts, NEETs, and people with social anxiety looking for a very quiet and still Discord server for the vast majority of the time.

I thought I should give a general idea about what the Discord server is looking for because this Discord server is also a way to help me make online friends off of Reddit, I also want to give a recap/some updates about the Discord server before I delete the mobile app off my phone in a day or two and take a break from Reddit (I don't know when I'll be back and I really can't answer that when I'll be back. I'm not even certain that I will redownload the app on my mobile phone again) Keep a reminder that I will not be turning off my chat request till another 24 hours or 42 hours around there then  you can just send me a chat request until these hours appear on the post when I'll be turning off my chat requests.

What I'm seeking further offline off of Reddit when I delete the app off my phone, keep a reminder that I'm not asking for offline Redditors to keep me company for those 24 or 42 hours that I will be online, I don't currently and I'll never currently seek something like that, that would do more harm than good That isn't subject to change either, I'll never want temporary contacts, just to make me feel a sense of false love from friendship, I want the connection to be real and not so much falsified of it all.

However this is important to understand that I'm simply and truthfully not looking for a quick and easy temporary contact within those 24 or 42 hours, I'm also just not looking for someone to message me for 24 and 42 hours then up and leave. The type of  connections that want to send me a chat request, understand that I'm looking for someone that is interested in texting me bya day-by-day basis and have the time to send a handful or a lot of text messages throughout the day on Discord (obviously everyone here knows that I don't do voice calls and I randomly send voice clips when I get the motivation to send them, and I don't want to be awkward, distracting, and embarrassing and embarrass myself on a video phone call instead.)

I should also state that the kind of person I am that I do best with is connecting with people through expressive text messages and expressive text messages from Redditors that are able to have expressive text messages through a lot of collective thoughts and to be able to have a lot of random conversations. Most of the days I'm just spending my life being in and out of being dissociative, listening to the beat and the vibe of the music that I get lost in the expressive art of music.

I excel in conversations that are an expressive art of emotional connection and emotional bonding with friends that are all related to that bonding with music or hyper-fixations of hobbies.

I'm also only seeking online friendships currently and I'm not interested in meeting anyone in real life this year due to my living conditions and my living conditions will change within a year or two from now.

Well enough of that and let's just go to another subject about the recap for the Discord server and updates about the Discord server before I make my last Discord promotion posts.

Updates on the Discord server.

Recap and new things about the Discord server and how the Discord server plays Skyrim.

You just might think, ""You really think this Discord server is okay for people with social anxiety with 60 people in the Discord server"" (I'm sure the Discord server will either rise or decrease when I say this, haha.) However, what makes you think 60 people in the Discord server are chatting up a storm? That's so inaccurately false, haha.

Yeah, well, this Discord server is heavily music-based, which means people with social anxiety will only check the notifications for the hashtags that are related to the music hashtags and will only text in the general text when the energy/vibes are right. Which is what is happening in the Discord server; nobody barely texts in the general chat hashtags, and obviously that makes sense, it being a Discord server that is heavily catering to the NEETs, introverts, and people with social anxiety.

That's how I am as well; I chat when I feel the energy, I'm feeling a break from the social anxiety, and I'm feeling chatty. I will say, speaking of social anxiety, introduction posts aren't required to chat/post amongst the Discord server members. However, if you feel the need to make an introduction post, then you can do that by doing what you normally post as an introduction post, as you would here on this subreddit.

Speaking of social anxiety, we're looking to help cure some of the sadness with cute cat pictures. Who here has cat pictures or cat videos that can help with the pet hashtag on the Discord server? If you don't have cats, then whatever pets you have or own work; that even includes if you have a pet gecko or salamander. You can also add to the spook factor if you get a lot of crows or ravens in your backyard for added vibes/coolness to the Discord server as well. I'm just trying to make this a non-toxic space for all and also trying to make friends that vibe with me.

Examples could be.

Jerry handmade inspired bracelets but without using the Sleep Token logo! However, we do have safety measures for everyone to follow to feel safe. Redditors that join this Discord server for this purpose must be able to show proof either by a piece of paper of their PayPal and the item next to the item or, if the person doesn't have proof of reviews from a retail website where you can sell your goods, by the item itself.

An example of that would be eBay reviews. I'm also trying to see if I can have a friend help me with getting animated flamingo stickers for Sleep Token vibes, and I will have to see what can be done for Lorna Shore. I'm not certain what animated emotes can be used for Lorna Shore. Maybe someone could chime in with ideas!

I'm also allowing people in the introduction post to post if they feel comfortable posting about looking for people to play video games with. I know Discord automatically has a connection feature for Steam and PlayStation profiles, but that doesn't help others/give a cue to Discord users to know if you want people to play with you or not.

I also don't think Nintendo will be interested in allowing a Discord connection option, which sucks.

Who knows, maybe it's a copyright issue with Nintendo why there can't be a Discord connection option to share your Nintendo code for others to add; that's such a shame/bummer!

Which I wanted to bring up about gaming, since it's already a spooky season, and Halloween will be right around the corner eventually and Redditors are probably wondering. Since my last posts, it's obvious enough that I'm seeking an 85 percent connection and spent the majority of that time online only rather than in person because of personal conflicts with the living conditions that I'm in right now that will change in a year or possibly in two years, and you can read more in the second pinned post, as that would explain it in more detail than bringing this post out way longer than it is right now haha. However, let's talk about what I'm talking about with friends and doing something on the arrival of Halloween.

I can tell you right now I can't multitask, as you've gathered from my previous posts that were previously deleted after being uploaded for a while.

It would be nice to sip on a coffee and text about whatever you feel like texting about, and we don't have to text about every single cutscene that hits the game unless you find that completely necessary.

We don't really have to do that, and I don't find that necessary unless the other person thinks that's necessary. We can just get virtually cozy and text about whatever while I enjoy the stream, and yeah, we can both agree on a game that you would enjoy double screen sharing.

We could even take a break, screen share on Discord my YT music shuffle playlist that I created, and just relax on Discord listening to music for an hour or longer than an hour, maybe an hour and a half, or maybe music/texting about whatever you feel like the topic should be for the evening/night.

That would be fine, and also for game streams. I normally enjoy watching for three or four hours on screen share or YT stream, whereas music playlist shuffle screen sharing with my friends for an hour or near/close to an hour and a half is perfect because I end up dozing off and falling asleep because I'm so relaxed, LMFAO. My ex-friend/ex-partner did this with me until he didn't like doing that with me anymore, and yeah, we used to do this a lot, and this is something that almost happened once. I was so relaxed with the shuffle playlist stream/chatting away that I ended up getting very sleepy/tired and dozed off for a few minutes, haha.

The friends that I've curiously asked how autistic I sound in the past in text messages have always replied, ""You sound very autistic, and it's very noticeable in your text messages.""

I just think that's fun, and if you think this is weird or too strange. Well, I can't tell you how many times that my autistic self was/were way too overwhelming for people to deal with.

Which I should make a loud and clear statement here: just because there are 60 people in the Discord server (I don't look at the number often, so this could be inaccurate right now.) I only have about 8 contacts on my friend lists; that's because I don't and I will never individually message someone on the Discord server unless the person starts the conversation first, rather than from the posts the Redditor read on my posts or a comment the Redditor read on my profile.


Where will you be since you're deleting the Reddit app from your mobile phone, anywhere else besides Discord? Telegram or Signal?

I don't know that answer, currently the only app I've on my phone is Discord and I don't know if I'll get a text messaging app to text my friends or partner if I become burnt out of Discord and only will have the Discord app on my Windows desktop to check the notifications if something pops up from the Discord server, if this happens I will make an update somewhere on the appropriate hashtag on the Discord server itself.

However for now, the Discord app is on my phone and I'm just tending to the Discord server, occasionally texting with friends inside the Discord server (which is almost always Lorna Shore news and posting cat pictures or videos.) and seeing if anyone new messages me when joining the Discord server if there is an interest in friendship. I just wait for the friendship to come to me, as I'm getting tired of looking for friendship, and I'm finding that I'm getting that autistic burnout and feeling overstimulated by everything/needing a break.

Yeah I can say that, from what I can gather how people are enjoying this Discord server, a lot of people have felt relaxed in this Discord server (in the past we had some drama happen in the Discord server, which I will not bring there and you can read my highly important pinned post, obviously there is a reason why those post are pinned to begin with.) However, other than that people enjoy how relaxed this Discord server is. Many people just wait to post band recommendations, lyrics videos, anything music related and cute pictures of people's pets, and sometimes a random bird photo will drop for people that want to take pictures of wildlife animals from their backyard or someone decided to post a random a random picture of a bird and decided to drop it there, which is fine if that's what people want to do. Adding the cuteness factor to the Discord server is what we want and, as I previously stated already, we need to add the spook factor by adding cute crows and ravens from your backyard!

What do friends think or partners think of matching phone cases and band stickers? Obviously the stickers will be Lorna Shore and Sleep Token obviously, haha. I'm also talking about if a friend or a partner of mine would enjoy matching a teal phone case or a cherry pattern phone case design to match, I think that's a cute idea! However, I know it's probably very hard to get a phone case because of very old phone models and one of my friends told me that TeePublic and Redbubble aren't shipping internationally anymore, which sucks! Speaking of international, I don't care if you're international! Even if I'm from the U.S. and if you've legitimate REAL cool/awesome vibes, then I want to get to know you!

This is how the Discord server owner plays Skyrim.

Skyrim updates.

The only reason why I joined Dawnguard was because I don't know what was up with my game, but who doesn't on a not modded Skyrim game? You never know what kind of problems you're going to run into in Skyrim with the hilarious and funny glitches. However, this seemed interesting to me, and I don't even know why that kept on happening to me at a very high chance rate, but almost 70 percent of the time I would fast travel. The vampires would be after me constantly, and I was annoyed.

What even got worse was a few vampires ruined some NPC quests I wanted to complete, so I'm taking my vengeance out on them for their annoyance, haha. However, this gave me the chance to see if I enjoyed the crossbow anyways, because when I played Skyrim on a console I didn't have any more, and obviously the save file was gone. My favorite style was blocking and using the Mace of Molag Bal.

However, using a crossbow is very deadly, and surprisingly, I'm very good at using a crossbow. Back when I played Skyrim on the console that I used to know, I just had the basic copy of Skyrim, nothing fancy and no special edition. However, that is different now since I play on the PS4. I'm also a Stormcloak, obviously, because I can't stand annoying politics where there are a bunch of NPCs talking about high praise for the Imperials, and it's just getting me to think, ""You're about as annoying as Nazeem,"" and every single time I go to Whiterun, here he goes with his famous Cloud District post. I've never seen an NPC be as annoying as a Stormcloak, though. However, it's no wonder why people want to kill Nazeem; he's literally annoying.

I want to see how much I can handicap myself this time around without using double enchantments on my gear but a single enchantment on my gear with my newry, and I'll also not be using any elemental protection to further handicap me, haha. I'm also on adept combat level mode because I think that's all the stress level I want to give myself while mildly handicapping myself on the game, and I don't think I want to change the combat level difficulty.

I simply and truthfully think the only way I'm going to survive a Falmer cave is if I have a tank follower with high experience in block, heavy gear, and archery to back me up. This is going to create a very stressful environment; however, I never handicapped myself like this on Skyrim, as I've always done double enchantments on my gear and my jewelry. I've also never done any elemental protection on my gear before, and I never did a 1-enchantment handicap on my gear and my jewelry.

What are you looking for in the Discord server? Are you looking for offline Redditors to help you with the Discord server? As a Discord owner do you need any assistance with anything that a offline Redditor can help you with? We also need to know what the Discord server icon is about and the Discord server title, what is that about?

Who is that on the Discord server icon? That's Will Ramos excited to eat something that made him pass out, damn the food must've been THAT good. I may/might change the Discord server's icon to Will Ramos's sigil name that's posted on my Reddit page (not my image, and I don't claim it's my image.) Will Ramos posted that on his social media when FB allowed you to click on images and save them without logging in. However, I'm having issues with that now, and oddly, I can't look at reels anymore without logging in. That's why I'm asking for others to help post Lorna Shore and Sleep Token newsfeeds on the correct hashtags on the Discord server. We're also looking for Discord members that want to occasionally post Lorna Shore and Sleep Token memes, which are welcomed in the correct hashtags to be posted. Obviously the Discord title name is obviously taken from a Lorna Shore song lyric, which most of the Redditors reading this probably expected just as much as that, haha.

1nw2194,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1nw2194/ive_had_enough_what_do_i_do/,"I’ve had enough, what do I do ?","Hi,

So for some background, I’m a male in my mid 20s and I have worked for the same company since I was 16.  Coming up for 9 years now, started as an apprentice and have worked my way into a decent career position for myself.

Everything is fine, but I have this god awful line manager who I physically cannot stand anymore.  He seems to pick on what he sees as “weak” targets to obviously offset his own insecurities.  I’ve noticed he especially picks on people who are either physically smaller than him, or on the younger side.

Some examples of stuff he says to me are:

I’ll be sitting at my desk minding my own business getting on with my work, someone will get up and offer to make everyone a coffee.  Line manager politely accepts their offer, then looks at me and will say something along the line of “why do you never do that, you’re lucky you are still employed you fucking bellend”

 It gets worse…..

The other day he gave me a task to do, I complete this task within a timely manor and signed the job off.  The next day I come into work, he tells me I “massively fucked up and need to rectify my issues immediately, and then you can make it up to me later by joining me in the shower you fucking gimp”

Like wtf…..I didn’t even make a mistake.  I went back and double checked my work everything was perfect, it turns out HE made a mistake and gave me the wrong information of what the task required.  I did exactly as I was asked, it was this guys lack of communication that is the issue.

I like my job, I’m good at it and I have some really good guys that I work with.  But other than the people I immediately work with I keep to myself.

It got the the point a few months ago I had enough of this guys comments like the above, so I snapped and said to him “how about you talk to me with some fucking respect, I’m sick of your shit”.  Not my proudest move at work and it didn’t go down very well because in response from him I got “if you talk to me like that again I’ll teach you a lesson or two”.

So yeah things aren’t great, the above is just 2 of 1000s of examples for you to get the idea of the position I’m in.  I’m sick of it, I dread going to work, I get anxious about going in and don’t sleep.  I like my actual job and don’t want to have to leave because of 1 person.

The problem is with this guy is he has favourites, they are allowed to turn up late and leave early, and in the main his favourites don’t do much work but he protects them.  I garuntee if I left even 5 minutes early he would be pulling me up.

He plays the game well because in front of higher up managers he is quite nice and personable, but as soon as we are back in our small office and he is the highest person in the room it all starts coming out.",1,1759407092.0,workplace_bullying,1,1.0,False

Ads make nootropics sound like magic brain pills. Reality’s way less exciting.

When you actually try them, it’s hit or miss.

Some kick in fast, others drag on for weeks, and plenty don’t seem to do much at all.

That made me wonder if they actually do anything, or only feel like they do.

They come in all types like herbs, synthetics, and straight-up stimulants.

Each one works differently, and the research behind them is very mixed.

* Caffeine or modafinil are the obvious ones. They wake you up, but that doesn’t mean your memory or problem-solving is suddenly better.
* Stuff like bacopa or ashwagandha gets hyped as safe long-term picks. But they usually need weeks to maybe show small, subtle effects.
* Premade stacks throw a bunch of ingredients into one pill. Looks convenient, but the real question is if it beats just drinking coffee.

I wanted to know if these stacks were hype, so I ran a little experiment with one of the popular blends. 

For 21 days I tracked how productive I was using[ this formula](https://www.reddit.com/r/suppgains/comments/1kcrqae/i_tracked_my_productivity_for_21_days_on_mind_lab/).

End result? Just small changes. Felt a bit sharper, maybe less distracted, but nowhere near the ad hype.

That doesn’t mean it was useless. Even a 10 percent improvement in focus can add up over time. 

The real question: is it worth dropping $60+ a month for results that are this small and hard to even measure?

Placebo’s a huge factor. If you pay for something and expect it to help, your brain will find little improvements to back it up.

It’s tricky to separate real changes from imagined ones without strict testing.

I still think some noots can be useful, as long as you keep expectations realistic.

Coffee is technically a nootropic, and we all know that works. 

Herbs may give a slow but steady benefit. Stacks at least save time compared to mixing powders yourself.

For me, it’s less about chasing quick fix promises and more about experimenting carefully. 

If something feels helpful and doesn’t cause side effects, I’ll keep it in my routine. If not, I just move on.

So yeah, nootropics aren’t total scams. But they’re definitely not shortcuts to genius either.

I was driving late at night, exhausted, on a rural road I’d taken a hundred times before. There’s a sharp curve with a guardrail at the edge of a steep drop, and as I rounded it, a wombat appeared out of nowhere. I swerved hard. I felt the car lose traction. I remember the sensation of falling — the seatbelt digging into my chest, the headlights spinning into darkness, a brief flash of absolute terror.

The next instant, I was back on the road, tires humming, hands gripping the wheel. No deer. No screech of brakes. My heart was hammering, and my GPS showed I’d somehow driven a quarter mile past the curve.

Here’s the weird part small details were off. My favorite podcast episode that I’d listened to earlier that day was now a different topic. A text message from my friend had a different wording than before. Even the logo on my coffee mug at home changed color.

I’ve read about quantum immortality before but always dismissed it as philosophy. Now I’m not so sure. Did I die on that curve? Did my consciousness shift sideways into a universe where I survived?

I can’t prove anything, but the feeling hasn’t left me.

He supervised about 12 departments and barely knew what I did. As long as my projects were submitted on time, I was basically a ghost.

But for some stupid reason, I felt restless. I got this idea in my head that my work wasn't 'making a difference' and all that nonsense. So I went and looked until I found a management position. It came with a higher salary, but the catch was that I had to return to the office full-time.

And it turned out to be a complete nightmare. I discovered I hate managing people. I can't stand their endless drama and problems, and the extra money is completely meaningless to me now.

""Just go to bed earlier"" felt like boomer advice that had nothing to do with my real problems.

I was dead wrong.

Everything you're struggling with traces back to this one thing you're probably ignoring.

When you can't focus, have no motivation and always emotional on small things, you're suffering from a **F\*cked up sleep schedule.**

I used to think I was ""not a morning person"" and that discipline was for people with better genetics. Turns out I was just chronically sleep-deprived and calling it personality.

Going to bed at random times is like constantly changing time zones. Your hormones, energy, and decision-making all sync to consistent timing. Mess with the timing, mess with everything.

Every bad habit you can't break? Every good habit you can't stick to? Sleep debt makes your prefrontal cortex (impulse control center) work at 50% worse. You're trying to build discipline with a broken tool.

If you struggle to sleep do this:

1. Pick ONE bedtime and defend it like rent money. Mine is 10:30pm. Non-negotiable.
2. Reverse-engineer your evening. Work backwards from bedtime. Dinner by 8pm, screens off by 9pm, wind-down routine starts at 10pm.
3. Morning light exposure within 30 minutes of waking. This sets your circadian clock. Skip coffee, get sunlight first.

Every successful person I know treats sleep like a business meeting with themselves. They don't negotiate, they don't make excuses, they just show up.

best* 12v kettle out there, at least for the single traveler wanting a
quick coffee or tea at any random time of the day.

Unlike almost every other 12v kettle buyable offline, it has a 400ml
capacity but can boil a quantity only as much as 50ml, due to the
heating element being the steel sides of the kettle, not an element
that needs to be submerged and wasting a lot of power (and time)
boiling more water than you'd need.

Power consumption while heating is 145 watts, and draws just over 11
amps -- this may be a problem for older cars with 10A-rated accessory
sockets/fuses (I'm using my DC-plug-to-Anderson lead..) Its shape is
the same as 'slim' water-bottle, so it fits into my Korean car's
coffee-holders.

It's great for making a single cup of tea! A big problem with
brewing tea is keeping the off-the-boil temperature for a few minutes,
which the Jetboil doesn't do too well with. It's not a problem to
place the teabag in after the water has boiled, and the heat inside
the Q.Bell kettle from the just-used electric element in the steel
walls keeps the temperature high for enough time.

There's three temperature settings -- 100C, 55C, and 45C. What use are
45 and 55? Liquor. Rum, Bourbon, Sake... (I figure milk would
gunk the insides, so I haven't tried it.)

Something that doesn't work too well is the lighting of the
temperature and activity LEDs -- totally invisible in daylight.
However the kettle also makes beeps when its capacitive button is
pressed, so it's not hard to guess what it's doing.

It's $39.

1nw1q79,https://i.redd.it/3nqcakwstosf1.jpeg,Grateful to have a place to hang my hat...,"Good morning! Our recent spate of variable weather has me thinking about the folks currently vacationing at our local campgrounds. Particularly the state park, which has no site hook-ups. That means whether in a tent or RV, campers are “boondocking” or “dry-camping"". Living in the great outdoors can be pleasant when conditions are good. But when they’re not—say, like last week's stretch of heavy rain, strong winds, and temperatures dipping into the 40s—it veers from “rustic respite” to “character-building experience.” Personally, I’ve done plenty of camping in every season and in all kinds of weather, but even I would struggle to call that a vacation.

There have been times when my tent wasn’t just a weekend getaway—it was my house. Especially when I left home soon after graduating at seventeen, I found that rentals were few and far between and even if available, might have been financially out of reach. During such times, I lived in campgrounds, or in the forest, often where friends with woodland acreage were kind enough to let me stay. But once, when I was especially stuck, I simply made camp deep in a piney wood.

This was well over forty years ago, before homeless camping was ""a thing"". I was working a seasonal job at a boatyard and had timed my rental lease to end just when the work was supposed to. But the boatyard asked if I could stay longer—first until Memorial Day, and later, requested I stay another two weeks. My landlords couldn’t extend the lease, but then a coworker remarked that there was a large plot of forest a few miles away where his Boy Scout troop used to camp when he was a boy—so perhaps I could set up there. I thought, “Five weeks, I can handle that.” Of course, it eventually turned into seven.

I was grateful to have a place to hang my hat, so to speak. I didn't have a vehicle, so I filled my backpack and trekked out to the area described and hiked into the woods until I found a spot near a fast-running creek. I set up my 5x7 foot puptent on a little rise to keep any potential rain from flooding my new digs. I had a swim-float for an air mattress, but even so, I didn't want to actually use it as a literal float.

In the beginning, it was too cold to worry about rain. Many mornings I awoke to find everything outside coated with a thick frost. On such mornings I used to bring my clothes inside the sleeping bag to warm them up before donning them.

I didn’t dare light campfires in the overgrown woods, so my little camp stove became the heart of my kitchen. Each morning, I hauled creek water in my makeshift “bucket”—a 10-gallon rectangular plastic trash bin that slid neatly into my pack. After chilling my fingers to the bone while dipping it in, I boiled water for instant coffee and oatmeal. A second pot of boiling water was poured into the bucket. Finally, scooping out a cupful for teeth-brushing, I was left with enough tepid water for what can only be described as a very brisk ""shower"".

Then, hair still damp, I’d trek out of the woods to hitchhike into work, put in a full day of hard labor at the boatyard, and hitchhike back—often stopping in at a little grocery store for a cold sandwich and drink for dinner. After all, food storage at my campsite was kept to a strict minimum—mostly instant coffee, oatmeal, and powdered soups—because fuzzy roommates with claws and teeth are not the kind you want to encourage.

Back at the site, there were chores to be done. Laundry was bucket-washed every day after work and was sometimes frozen stiff by morning. Nonetheless, it worked out okay. I had a few changes of clothing so that by the time I needed to wear those clothes again, they were ready. 

That life was exhausting, cold, and always left me hungry. And yet—I didn't mind. I was able to save money I would've otherwise paid in rent and seven weeks of woodland camping wasn't that big a deal. Still, I was very glad when I finally moved onto another job and found a new rental.

So, when I think about vacationers in their rain-soaked tents—or about the prehistoric peoples who populate my books—I can empathize. Outdoor living has its highs and lows. It builds toughness, yes, but it also builds a deep appreciation for four walls, a roof, and central heating.

I hope all is well in your corner of the world! 🌞

1nw1ood,https://www.reddit.com/r/PassNclex/comments/1nw1ood/failed_at_150_passed_with_85_questions/,"Failed at 150, Passed with 85 questions!","Hi everyone, just wanted to share my journey because I know someone out there might be in the same boat I was. Long post ahead.

I graduated BSN back in 2008 but never pursued nursing. Instead, I became a chef and spent the last 13+ years building a career I truly enjoyed and was successful at. But in 2025, I decided it was time for a career change and started processing for NCLEX.

First attempt (June 2025): I prepped for 6 months since I know I have to cover a lot for content, used Bootcamp, Mark K, Dr. Sharon, and couple of Nursing Study book. I did everything I thought I needed to do, studied 8+ hours a day, and honestly burned myself out. 

Got 2 High & 2 Very High for Self-Assessments and 70% overall. Still ended up failing at 150 questions. It was heartbreaking, but I realized I wasn’t giving myself real breaks or letting rationales sink in.

Second attempt (9/30/2025): I completely changed my approach. And yesterday, I passed!!! 💪😭 Checked my BON website and saw the license info posted—I still can’t believe it.

Uworld Stats: 
Self Assessments: 2 Very High, 1 High
CATs: 75-78% with 98th-99th percentile

Here’s what I did differently this time:

1. UWORLD, UWORLD, UWORLD. Cannot recommend enough. I watched all the lecture videos and focused on rationales. Whenever I felt like scrolling reels, I swapped in 1–2 UWorld videos. Those small swaps added up big time.

2. Study schedule that worked for ME. This is important—build a schedule that works for YOU, not just what others post online. I am not a morning person, so instead of forcing myself into 8-hour marathons, I adjusted to my natural rhythm. Bonus tip: If you can, schedule your actual exam at the same time you’re used to studying. My first attempt was an 8 am exam and I was exhausted even before starting. This time, I scheduled for 1 pm—same time I practiced every day—and it made a huge difference. I felt at ease because my brain was already trained to focus during that time.


- 1.5 hours of refresh lectures + reviewing post-its
- 10–15 min break (iced coffee + sitting outside staring at my plants = brain reset 🌱)
- Rest of the day: 100 practice questions + 2-3 sets of CATs until about 5–6 pm. 

- I also used my last CPR to focus on strong vs. weak areas. 👉 What I’m saying is: don’t copy-paste anyone’s schedule. Study at the time of day you’re most productive, and structure it in a way you can stick with.


3. Days off are OK. If I felt overwhelmed, I took the day off. Before, I would force myself to push through, and it completely backfired. This time, I respected my limits.

4. Mindset. I prayed, manifested, and reminded myself of my hard work. I believed I could do it. Giving myself credit was huge.

5. Extra Resources that helped me:
-  Mark K:  Outdated, but still gold for OB and prioritization.
- Dr. Sharon: Her 50 pharm drugs + prioritization were clear and to the point.
- Simple Nursing videos: Great for refreshing content—fun, simplified, and interactive.
- Bootcamp cheat sheets: Helped me visualize pathophysiology and remember NCLEX star tips.

6. Day of the Exam:
   Honestly, I felt calm. So calm it felt a little weird compared to my first attempt when I was super anxious.
-  Before starting the 1st question, I prayed and centered myself.
- I used the white board a lot since I was so used to UWorld’s highlight feature. I wrote down cues and notes for case studies—went through 4 white boards in total.
- For each question, I took a deep breath before answering.
- My test had about 6–7 case studies (6 questions), 15+ SATA, stand-alone questions, maybe 2 pharm meds I didn’t know, some prioritization.
- No bow-tie questions, but plenty of single case studies.

👉 If you’re a long-time graduate or repeat test taker, please believe in yourself. Your timeline doesn’t define your success. If I can do this after being away from nursing for 16 years, so can you.

She was confused, so she looked around and just watched for a while. She saw a lot more people than she expected; they were conversing, making deals of formulas and characteristics. With a long mottled chair and multiple chairs, she saw Mr. Fool sitting at the end of the table, cloaked in gray fog. *Considering everyone here is also pulled by Mr. Fool, they should all probably be beyonders like me. If only my memory regarding the Beast Tamer potion formula wasn’t erased when moving my body.* Eli thought, after a while, she opened her mouth, “Does anybody here have the main ingredient, characteristics, or formula of Beast Tamer?”


While waiting for answers, she overheard some other people conversing, “Does anyone here know how to properly master a beyonder potion?” “It's about acting.”

*Acting? Like, acting the potion name out? Hmm* Eli pondered

As Eli tried to ask for details, another man cloaked in gray fog answered her, “I can sell u a beast tamer characteristic for only 600 pounds.”

Eli was not familiar with how the money worked here, so she’s not sure if she’s being scammed or not. The numbers seem to be very similar to the numbers in the fifth epoch, though. She just let out a sound, “Hmm.”

The man looked like he understood Eli’s concern and answered, “That's the same price as market price, only a few extra for my troubles.”

Eli checked her money reserves. She contemplated for a bit, as she had completely forgotten the Beast Tamer formula due to the memory mixing. She also had to buy the formula separately, but having the characteristics would be very useful, too. “Very well, I will pay you 600 pounds for the Beast Tamer Characteristic.”

The man smiled, he told her, “Very well, I shall acquire the characteristic and give it to u in a day.”

Eli was surprised, “A day? How can I guarantee your offer?” Delaying deals due to a lack of product in a beyonder gathering is a huge liability.”

The man just answered, “You will also pay me in a day, dear customer, and by looking at this place, I'm pretty sure whoever did it can guarantee no scamming happens.”

Eli nodded, “Very well.”

Suddenly, a voice resounded from the figure at the edge of the table: ""If you desire to trade materials, sacrifice them to me, and I shall deliver them for you. I assume you know how to do a simple sacrificial ritual, and if you don't, someone else from here should. I assume you also know my name, don't you?"" he said with a hint of a smile on his face and glee in his voice.

Eli looked at the man in the suit, hidden in the gray fog. “The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era; The Mysterious Ruler above the Gray Fog; The King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.”

“Indeed,” He answered.

Eli turned back to the man she had just made a deal with, “Wait, sir, I haven't gotten your name yet. How may I address you?”

“U may address me as Mr. Death,” He said

Eli was in slight shock, *Oh no, I need to think of an alias too, uhhhh, Eli? No, that’s just my nickname, Milla? Also, no, Uhh, Elizabeth Carmilla Amarantha von Edelweiss? …Eca?* “You can call me… Eca”

The man nodded and answered, “Well then, good to meet u aka”

“Umm, Eca, sir.”

“Oh, sorry, Eca.”

After the deal was done, she checked around and saw a woman fall into a fit of laughter and keel over, clutching her stomach. She laughs loudly, Eli looks at her in confusion, just watching. 

Then someone asked, ""Is there any person here that lives in Caelastria?"" Eli looked at the man, unsure what to say, but she stared for a suspiciously long time, and someone else noticed her, not that they could see through the fog covering everyone’s face.

""What is caelastria?"" Someone else asked the man, Eli just watched them, unsure what to say, *There are more cities outside, it seems*, but she chose not to reveal her identity, as everyone could be a potential enemy.

She then heard a familiar voice, saying, “Praise the brilliant crimson moon!”

She immediately looked at the woman cloaked in the gray fog, “Seli?”

Seli looked at her back, saying, “Call me… Moonchaser”

“Oh, Moonchaser, it's me, it's... Eca, remember? the alley?” Eli smiled brightly, seeing someone she actually knew *It seems like the ones from the fifth epoch are all here*

“Yes... Eca. the admin has not operated a mind cleansing on my brain,” Seli answered, she looked to be slightly annoyed, slightly joking, but her facial expression is unclear

“Oh, that's... good?” Eli answered

Seli then bowed, “Praise the beauty.”

Eli was slightly flustered, “Ah, yes, praise the beauty.”

Seli immediately looked happy.r “My, Eca, you never told me you worship the moon. How splendid to find a compatriot so close. Yes, this occasion asks for another praise. Let us sanctify the Embodiment of Beauty and Charm!”

Eli was stunned, as she just replied Praise the beauty out of reflex from the sudden praise Seli, no Moonchaser did “Uhh, that's my ancestor, so naturally.”

“How glorious! And how have you been, Eca?” Seli asked kindly

“It's... an exhausting day,” Eli answered.

“Then let the mooguidedr you. There happens to be a delightful potion mix called coffee, and I seemingly have a lot of it,” Seli proudly told her

“Uhh, okay, thanks?” *What do you mean coffee is a potion? And who do you take me as? I know what coffee is*

Seli, after listening to this, said, “If you wish, I could brew up a mix of chamomile, peppermint, and various other herbs for relaxation. Or if you prefer, I can concoct a potion for rejuvenation.”

“Oh, herbal tea... Yeah, that... Would be appreciated,” Eli answered, her mind went to the time when her father made tea for her, her eyes were filled with longing.

They chit-chatted for a bit before Eli returned to the real world. 

—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eli set a ritual the next day to sacrifice 600 pounds to Mr. Death, to which he reciprocated by sending the characteristics. *Good, now I have the characteristic,* Eli happily thought. She brewed a cup of herbal tea for herself, reminiscing about her old time with her father. She went to the Natrus department and saw the billboard.

“Attention! An anonymous tip has informed us of something. There has been a group spotted with a suspiciously large amount of firearms in the Magispirum sector near the border of tier 1 and tier 2 housing districts. Investigation required. Do NOT under any circumstances attempt to engage with the members of the group in the building unless absolutely necessary.

Submit reports of investigation into “Investigative Reports” under Admin under the “Submissions Desk”.  

Report of Sequences 8 and 9 members of the Hexagon require the signature of their respective Professors to be considered valid.”

“Oh, a mission?” Eli looked at the notice board, not sure what to do, she is just an apothecary with weak strength and above average stamina *Should I do this* she thought to herself. *Oh well, it’s not like I need to fight them.*

She prepared a bottle filled with the herbal tea she brewed for hydration. And she walked there, inconspicuously, blending in with the populace. She walked to the Magispirius sector without causing any suspicion; she cogitated along the way to cleanse her mind and act her way for the sake of investigation.

*Is this the magispirius sector? Looks similar enough* she walked around the housing district, trying to find the border between tier 1 and tier 2 housing *It seems like I’m in tier 2 right now.*

She looked like a resident, going around, so she just stretched her body and jogged her way around the neighbourhood, looking like a resident exercising. But she wasn’t just exercising; she was observing anyone walking in the vicinity, anyone mildly suspicious, or even just kids playing around.

Both living sector provides homes for families. Nearing the border, she can see that the tier 1 living sector is smaller and looks to be cramped than tier 2; they have a very apparent separation between the 2 sectors. 

*This should be the place where it was reported, hmm* Eli pondered for a while. She saw a bench and sat down, intentionally making her breath heavier. She sweats quite a lot when she sits down, feeling very hot from running in the sun, although she doesn’t feel tired due to her higher stamina, she sometimes wonders how her muscular strength is so low with such a high stamina body. 

She observed the area around her; there aren’t a lot of people going around. As the wind blew, cooling her down, she actually felt somewhat calm. She focused on everyone going around, but it seems like there is no one suspicious or carrying any form of firearm. She sat there for a good 10 minutes before standing up and stretching her body again. It was then that she saw a group of men going together, entering a single person's housing in tier 1 *Bingo* she thought to herself.

Why would 3 men be entering housing for a single person during the day? Their work is not in that area, and it’s not the usual time for them to go to each other’s place to play. She tried not to be suspicious as she memorized the housing room they went into. She then got her way to the building containing the flats. She went upstairs, and she found the room she was looking for, 413.

She then went further up, to the roof, to observe the area around the building to find an efficient escape route if she were ambushed downstairs. She enjoyed the wind for a while, drinking her herbal tea that already turned cold *I should use a thermos next time*. Instead of going down the stairs, she actually chose to go to the roof of another building. She cogitated for a bit, and she jumped without hesitation to another building’s roof, which is not far from the other building.

She casually went down the stairs like a resident and left with her empty bottle of water, and left the area back to tier 2, before going back to Natrus to report her findings. When she tried to write and submit a report to the admin, it was rejected as there was no professor’s approval.

“I’m sorry, but who’s my professor?” Eli asked, she has seriously not been introduced to her own professor, which caused her to grumble inwardly

“Your professor is Professor Aron,” The admin said after checking the database.

“Aron? As in the lab assistant?” Eli asked in confusion

“Ah, he’s on it again,” The admin said, “He is a little bit eccentric, and often does examinations and labwork himself, acting as an assistant to himself.” he sighed, “You can find him in the laboratory.” 

Eli thanked the man and went to the laboratory, where she was greeted by the same man. “Welcome to Natrus General Laboratory. My name is Aron, and how can I help you?”

Eli glared at him and said, “I need your approval signature for my investigative report.”

“Oh, they already told you, it’s no fun,” Aron pouted. “Oh well, give me the report, I’ll sign them for you”

Eli gave him the paper and signed it, and then she just left after bowing.

Aron looked at her. “The new member, huh? I thought she’d ask more questions, oh well.”

Eli submitted her investigative report and returned back *What a weird man* she thought along the way.

3. Days off are OK. If I felt overwhelmed, I took the day off. Before, I would force myself to push through, and it completely backfired. This time, I respected my limits.

4. Mindset. I prayed, manifested, and reminded myself of my hard work. I believed I could do it. Giving myself credit was huge.

5. Extra Resources that helped me:
-  Mark K:  Outdated, but still gold for OB and prioritization.
- Dr. Sharon: Her 50 pharm drugs + prioritization were clear and to the point.
- Simple Nursing videos: Great for refreshing content—fun, simplified, and interactive.
- Bootcamp cheat sheets: Helped me visualize pathophysiology and remember NCLEX star tips.

6. Day of the Exam:
   Honestly, I felt calm. So calm it felt a little weird compared to my first attempt when I was super anxious.
-  Before starting the 1st question, I prayed and centered myself.
- I used the white board a lot since I was so used to UWorld’s highlight feature. I wrote down cues and notes for case studies—went through 4 white boards in total.
- For each question, I took a deep breath before answering.
- My test had about 6–7 case studies (6 questions), 15+ SATA, stand-alone questions, maybe 2 pharm meds I didn’t know, some prioritization.
- No bow-tie questions, but plenty of single case studies.

👉 If you’re a long-time graduate or repeat test taker, please believe in yourself. Your timeline doesn’t define your success. If I can do this after being away from nursing for 16 years, so can you.

Good luck to everyone studying—you got this! 💯",3,1759405926.0,NCLEX,0,1.0,False

Lowkey online, a bit shy at first but easily carried away when I’m in a good mood. I love cozy nights in just as much as the occasional beach trip.
I’m happiest with a cup of matcha or coffee, a good book, my dog, and some warm music playing in the background. I love cooking, plants, tattoos, and small romantic moments that make life feel soft.
I might not know much about art, but I love appreciating it the same way I love people who can find beauty in simple things. Quiet moments, playful banter, and genuine connections are my favorite things.

What I’m Looking For

Someone who values peace, depth, and small moments just as much as laughter and fun. Someone kind, emotionally aware, and grounded, who enjoys cozy nights in, but won’t say no to a spontaneous trip every now and then. Someone who communicates, listens, and respects privacy, but can also tease, banter, and laugh with me until midnight.

We’ll Get Along If

* You’re open-minded but grounded in good values and principles
* You respect religion and other people’s beliefs
* You don’t smoke cigarettes and don’t drink excessively (I don’t either, I just have a different vice)
* You’re career-oriented but your life doesn’t revolve solely around work
* You’re family-oriented and not judgmental
* You’re educated and genuinely enjoy learning
* You like working out but you’re not a sports or gym snob 🏋️‍♂️
* You’re looking for a partner, not someone who’s just a maybe to you
* You’re honest, upfront, and dislike games (except for game nights, because I’ll definitely bring you to those 🎲)
* You love road trips, even the short spontaneous ones
* You want to be loved and appreciated fully and you’re capable of giving that same kind of love back

I’m a morena and I’m confident about how I look, but I’m not comfortable sharing photos right away, not because I’m hiding anything, but because I prefer getting to know someone first and I like keeping my digital footprint small.
If you’re the kind of person who has a very specific “type,” it might not work out— and that’s okay. But if you’re someone who values connection over surface-level attraction, I’d love to get to know you. Although I won’t lie, physical attraction still matters too. :)

I'm currently exploring the idea of relocating to Mombasa. I'm deeply interested in Swahili culture and have a growing passion for coffee — not just as a drink, but as a cultural and community experience.

My dream is to open a small shop or café in Mombasa that celebrates and promotes local culture, supports the community, and maybe even highlights locally sourced coffee. I'm really inspired by the richness of the Swahili coastal heritage and would love to be a part of that in a meaningful way.

I'm still in the early stages of planning, so I’d truly appreciate any advice or insights from locals or expats who’ve made similar moves. What should I be aware of? What are the do’s and don’ts? Any help would mean a lot!

Hey everyone,

Ever feel like you're running on a treadmill, putting in the effort but not really moving forward? It’s easy to get caught up in the idea that we need some massive, life-altering change to feel better. But honestly, I've found that the biggest upgrades often come from the smallest, most consistent tweaks.

It's all about building momentum with small, daily wins. Here are a few simple hacks that have made a huge difference for me.

*   **The Two-Minute Rule.** This is a game-changer for procrastination. The rule is simple: if a task takes less than two minutes to complete, do it **immediately**. Answering that email, putting your dish in the dishwasher, tidying one small surface. It's shocking how much mental clutter this clears and how much momentum it builds.

*   **Create a ""Shutdown Ritual.""** How many of us let our workday bleed into our evening? A shutdown ritual creates a clear boundary. It doesn't have to be complicated. Mine is just clearing my desk, writing down my top 3 priorities for tomorrow, and then closing my laptop for good. It signals to my brain that the workday is **over**, and it's time to relax.

*   **Perform a Quick ""Energy Audit.""** A few times a day, just pause and ask yourself: ""On a scale of 1-10, where is my energy?"" If it's low, ask why. Are you thirsty? Tired? Overwhelmed by a task? This simple check-in allows you to respond to your body's needs in real-time. Sometimes, managing our inner world needs more than a quick hack, especially when our energy is consistently low. If you're looking for a more structured way to tackle emotional well-being, I've personally found **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** to be incredibly helpful.

*   **Stack Your Habits.** Trying to build a new habit is tough. Stacking makes it easier. Just link the **new** habit you want to form with an **existing** one. For example: ""After I pour my morning coffee (existing habit), I will read one page of a book (new habit)."" The old habit becomes the trigger for the new one, making it almost automatic.

*   **Log One Win.** At the end of the day, take 30 seconds to write down one thing that went well. It doesn't have to be monumental. ""I finished a tough report."" ""I drank enough water."" ""I didn't hit snooze."" Acknowledging your wins, no matter how small, rewires your brain to look for the positive and proves to yourself that you *are* making progress.

These aren't about becoming a productivity robot; they're about creating more space, energy, and intention in your day.

My one year old boy is extremely anxious and I want to figure out a way forward to improve both his quality of life and mine! In the house, he barks like CRAZY whenever he hears or sees someone on the block. Last night was terrible - there were a bunch of kids playing/yelling on our street which hasn’t happened before and he barked so loudly for an hour, reducing me to tears from all the stress. When we are out on walks or at a brewery/coffee shop, he doesn’t want anyone to pet him (jumps back even when they kneel to his level and move slowly) and barks at people walking by while we’re seated at a table even if I have him in a “down” position and am giving him treats. He is extremely jumpy when other dogs are greeting him, especially if they are high energy. Recently he met a young puppy who he barked at incessantly, and the puppy just sat and stared at him confused! 

I know a lot of people are going to blame socialization - we were maybe a little too afraid to have him out and about before his vaccinations were done but we did have him around people and trusted dogs in my family and he did a petco puppy class with another dog; we live in a densely populated area where he encounters tons of people and dogs on walks as well. I’m not here to argue if we did “enough”, I just want to hear advice on a way forward and if anyone with a similar pup saw improvements with age. ",39,1759405179.0,Dachshund,4,1.0,False

1nw18dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyReviewed/comments/1nw18dp/reveal_the_truth_about_zep_allpurpose_cleaner_for/,Reveal the Truth About Zep All-Purpose Cleaner for Every Surface,"The Zep All-Purpose Cleaner B07PDVFSQ7 is something that found its way into my daily cleaning arsenal recently, and I’ve got quite a bit to say about it. At first glance, it boasts a clean and straightforward promise—“cuts through grease, grime, and dirt.” But promises aside, how well does it actually perform? I thought the best way to find out was to put it through every cleaning challenge my home could offer.

**Ease of Use in Everyday Cleaning Tasks**

Opening the bottle, the first thing I noticed was the crisp yet chemical-like scent it carried—it’s not overwhelming, but you do notice it while applying. For everyday messes, such as countertops covered in cooking debris or the occasional spilled coffee on a tiled surface, the cleaner gets to work fast. My kitchen counter looked pristine after just a few sprays, requiring minimal scrubbing. Using it on stainless steel left the surfaces in my kitchen looking shiny without streaks, which was a win in my book. However, it does take a few tries before you understand how much solution is needed, as an overly liberal application can lead to leftover residue.

**Performance: Does it Tackle Stubborn Stains?**

Moving into the tougher jobs, I tested this on bathroom grime; specifically, a long-neglected fiberglass shower floor. To my surprise, a few sprays and letting it sit for a minute or two worked wonders. The formula lived up to its “professional grade” claim, cutting through dirt and soap scum without requiring too much manual effort. However, it is worth noting that while it excels on grease, dirt, tile, and stainless steel, the label clearly warns against using it on natural stone like granite and automotive paint. That’s a limitation worth keeping in mind.  

**Grab Zep All-Purpose Cleaner with ease and efficiency.**  
[Check Zep B07PDVFSQ7 price on Amazon.](https://info.senaar.com/p/b07pdvfsq7/)

**Strengths**

The versatility is one of its biggest strengths. Being able to use the cleaner on painted trim, porcelain, and even cabinets made it a convenient one-stop solution for several areas of the house. I found myself switching less between different products, which saved me time and space under my kitchen sink. Another highlight was how little product is actually needed per cleaning session. A few sprays go a long way, adding to its longevity.

- Cuts through grease, dirt, and grime effectively  
- Works on various surfaces, including stainless steel and painted trim  
- Minimal scrubbing needed for everyday mess  
- Shines without streaking  

**Limitations**

On the flip side, there are some limitations worthy of discussion. The scent, while tolerable, might be off-putting for those sensitive to chemical smells. Additionally, being unable to use it on natural stone could be a deal-breaker if you have granite or marble countertops. Lastly, some surfaces did show a slight residue if the cleaner wasn’t wiped down promptly, which made me feel like I had to follow up with just water at times.

- Not suitable for natural stone or carpets  
- Can leave residue if used excessively  
- Scent might not be to everyone’s liking  

**Product Competitors**

From my previous experiences, comparable products like the Mrs. Meyer’s Clean Day Multi-Surface Cleaner offer a more natural scent and are generally gentler on surfaces like stone, making them better suited for households seeking a mild and eco-friendly alternative. On the flip side, heavy-duty options like the Simple Green All-Purpose Cleaner offer similar grease-cutting abilities but can sometimes demand more frequent rinsing, especially on shiny surfaces. The Zep cleaner stands tall with its professional-grade performance but loses some ground due to its limitations with stone and low tolerance for overuse.

**Value for Money**

When assessing this cleaner’s price-to-quality ratio, I’d say it’s well worth its spot in your cleaning cabinet for its efficiency and versatility. It’s clearly designed to function as a professional-grade product, yet remains accessible for residential use. It might not replace every cleaner you own because of its limitations with surfaces like stone, but it definitely adds significant value to the tougher cleaning tasks. If maximizing performance with minimal effort is your priority, this product does deliver on that front.

1nw1750,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1nw1750/reveal_if_20_mule_team_borax_really_works_for/,Reveal if 20 Mule Team Borax Really Works for Tough Stains,"**My Experience with the 20 Mule Team All Natural Borax Detergent Booster & Multi-Purpose Household Cleaner**

The first thing that struck me about the 20 Mule Team All Natural Borax Detergent Booster was its versatile nature. I mean, it’s not every day you stumble across a product that claims to clean your laundry, freshen your counters, and tackle hard water deposits—all in one go. I've been testing this product in my household for a while now, and I must admit, it’s been quite a revelation. From greasy stovetops to those stubborn laundry stains from my kids' outdoor adventures, this cleaner has certainly earned a rightful place in my cleaning arsenal.

**Ease of Use**

Using this product couldn’t be simpler. For laundry, I just added a half cup to my washing machine alongside my regular detergent, and I observed how it dealt with stains that had been part of shirts longer than I care to admit. My clothes came out looking and feeling fresher, which was quite a surprise since I wasn’t entirely convinced beforehand. The application for other uses, like scrubbing countertops or cleaning bathroom tiles, was equally straightforward. Just mix the Borax with water in the suggested ratios, grab your sponge or mop, and you’re good to go. 

[Check 20 Mule Team All Natural Borax Detergent Booster price on Amazon.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b01nbjz2f8/)

**Pros**

- One of the strengths of this product is its unbeatable versatility.  
- The natural mineral composition means fewer harmful chemicals compared to many conventional cleaners.  
- Exceptional at cutting through grease, soap scum, and grime on counters and appliances.  
- Effectively tackles laundry stains while deodorizing clothes.  
- Perfect for DIY enthusiasts looking to incorporate it into crafts or home-preserving projects.  

**Cleaning Performance**

The cleaning performance exceeded my initial expectations. I used it on my kitchen counters after a particularly messy baking session. With a quick wipe-down, it removed greasy smears and left the surface sparkling. In the laundry room, it worked wonders on blotchy coffee stains I thought were permanent. It even deodorized the fabric, giving everything a noticeably cleaner smell without being overpowering. However, fair warning: this isn’t something you’ll find scented—it’s more functional than fancy in that regard.

**Potential Drawbacks**

- It’s best to handle this cleaner with gloves to prevent skin dryness after repeated contact.  
- The powder's packaging lacks a resealable option, making it prone to accidental spills if you're not careful.  
- It might not mix as quickly with cold water compared to warm, which could be a hassle during use.  

**Materials and Multi-Purpose Use**

The Borax doesn't stop at your laundry; it’s also excellent across other areas around the house. My kids tend to turn the bathroom into a soap-scummy disaster zone, so I tried the Borax there. Sure enough, it removed residue from shower doors and left the sink gleaming. For a fun twist, my neighbor even mentioned using it to preserve flowers for crafting—it’s such a unique multi-purpose tool that I genuinely didn’t expect when I picked it up.

**Product Comparisons**

In comparison to other multi-surface cleaners I’ve tried, the Borax stood out for its eco-friendliness and affordability. Products like my usual all-in-one spray cleaners are quicker for small counter messes, but they also contain more artificial scents and chemicals. Similarly, standard laundry stain removers get the job done, but I noticed they lack the deodorizing kick that Borax provides. One thing it doesn’t beat is convenience; liquid products tend to be quicker to apply—but pound for pound, this has far greater versatility.

**Value Proposition**

I’d call this strong value for money, especially if your household finds itself needing multipurpose cleaners often. This single product performs tasks that would often require separate purchases, like grease-cutting sprays, tile cleaners, and fabric fresheners. If you’re on the hunt for budget-friendly options that don’t feel cheap or overly watered-down, this might just hit your sweet spot. It’s ideal for families who need efficient solutions without breaking the bank.

# Oct. 1st, 2025~Rare Earth Magnets Have Become the New Battleground for Global Power

[Rare Earth Magnets Have Become the New Battleground for Global Power | OilPrice.com](https://oilprice.com/Metals/Commodities/Rare-Earth-Magnets-Have-Become-the-New-Battleground-for-Global-Power.html)

https://preview.redd.it/0eyn5ybmlosf1.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d59ccb920c504b339bb73f2a518eabb0ac3891d

* **China controls roughly 80% of global rare earth magnet production and has recently tightened export controls, reshaping global supply dynamics.**
* **EU imports of Chinese magnets rose 21% in August, while U.S. imports fell 5%, highlighting Europe’s growing dependence.**
* **New Western magnet factories are under construction in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, but experts warn it could take years to erode China’s dominance.**

Resource security when it comes to rare earth magnets is something the modern-day world has been desperately trying to get right. This is primarily due to rare earths’ increasing importance in electronics, defense, vehicles, and much more. 

For years, countries have been seeking ways to secure access to these vital resources. However, 90% of the current supply is in the hands of China, whose relationship with the U.S. and other countries has not been ideal of late. Despite best efforts, many nations remain dependent on Beijing for their [rare earth needs.](https://agmetalminer.com/2025/09/09/rare-earths-mmi-end-of-summer-rally/) Now, that could be starting to change.

# Rare Earth Magnets More Critical Than Ever

These days, almost every progressive nation covets rare earth magnets due to their ability to deliver exceptionally strong magnetic force in compact sizes, enabling the construction of high-efficiency motors and miniaturized components. This is what allows them to power essential systems in electric vehicles, wind turbines, smartphones, medical devices, and defense equipment.

The magnets possess unique properties, such as heat resistance, which makes them even more critical in applications where performance and precision are crucial. So, as global industries shift toward electrification and automation, rare earth magnets have become strategic assets, with supply chain control increasingly viewed as a matter of national security.

# China’s Dominance Remains an Issue

Once again, China controls about 80% of rare earth magnets production. In total, the country produces over 200,000 tons of magnets annually, which accounts for the vast majority of the global supply. In contrast, North America and Europe together manufacture fewer than 2,000 tons, while Japan and Vietnam contribute about 25,000 tons.

Until about six months ago, the supply of these magnets from China to the rest of the world was going on well. Then Beijing decided to pull the plug and suspend exports to some of its key trading partners, including the U.S. and the European Union, in an apparent warning against proposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. Since then, China has allowed limited exports, but it still maintains tighter controls to reinforce its geopolitical influence.

# E.U. Import Up, U.S. Down

Now, newly released data shows that the EU’s purchase of rare earth magnets increased in August this year, while imports to the U.S. declined. According to [news agency](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-22/china-s-magnet-exports-to-eu-surge-as-bloc-bears-brunt-of-crunch) Bloomberg, this points to concerns over resource security, as the European nations face the sharpest strain from tightening global magnet supplies.

Meanwhile, analysts caution that intensifying trade tensions may further jeopardize access to these critical materials, threatening to derail Europe’s green technology goals and undermine its industrial competitiveness.

In total, exports from China to the EU went up 21% in August, reaching 2,582 tons. At the same time, deliveries to the U.S. dropped 5% month-over-month, touching about 590 tons. The EU’s dependence on these magnets is clearly going north as the data showed that, year-to-date, imports from China had tripled compared to the U.S. According to experts, this serves to underline a larger shift in global supply dynamics.

# New Western Production is Coming, Eventually

For now, it seems China’s dominance in rare earth magnets will continue. According to a [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/business/china-rare-earths-magnets.html) in the New York Times, the U.S. is trying to play catch-up with the Eastern nation. But despite these new efforts, the vast majority of the world’s magnet supply still originates from Chinese refineries.

The U.S. currently has four domestic magnet factories nearing completion. Meanwhile, in neighboring Canada, Neo Performance Materials just launched a major facility in Narva, Estonia. This site nearly doubles European and the U.S. production capacity and could scale to 5,000 tons. However, the NYT report also states that the full ramp-up will take years.

North America and Europe collectively purchase close to 40,000 tons of rare earth magnets each year. Therefore, setting up magnet factories in the U.S. and some other countries seems to be one way out of the China predicament.

However, China’s dominance is rooted in decades of investment and near-total control over rare earth processing. It manufactures most of the world’s refining equipment and employs nearly all the specialized technicians. Some analysts say it will take years—even a decade—to break this stranglehold completely.

[Palladium stone and ingot by RHJ via iStock](https://preview.redd.it/amyjoomwkosf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=062ee0342310a8703c7dd8ea5dede39da4ffcd12)

The Trump administration's decision to take an equity stake in MP Materials [(MP)](https://www.barchart.com/quotes/MP) sent shockwaves through the mining sector. The Pentagon's unprecedented deal with America's largest rare earth producer included a [government equity position](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/28/mp-materials-lithium-americas-lac-rare-earth-trump-stake.html) and a price floor of $110 per kilogram for key magnetic materials. Now investors are wondering which companies might be next in line for similar federal backing.

The rationale is straightforward, as China controls roughly 70% of U.S. rare earth imports, giving Beijing enormous leverage over materials critical to everything from F-35 fighter jets to electric vehicles (EVs) and smartphones. 

For years, China has [allegedly suppressed prices](https://www.csis.org/analysis/building-new-market-counter-chinese-mineral-market-manipulation) to squeeze Western competitors out of the market. The MP Materials deal signaled Washington's willingness to abandon strict free market principles and meet national security demands.

The government needs multiple partnerships to diversify risk and ensure reliable domestic production of these strategic materials. So, here are three other mining stocks that should be on your watchlist right now. 

# USA Rare Earth (USAR)

Valued at a market cap of $1.67 billion, USA Rare Earth [(USAR)](https://www.barchart.com/quotes/USAR) is a pre-revenue company engaged in mining, processing, and supplying rare earths and other critical minerals in the United States. It explores for neodymium, dysprosium, terbium, gallium, beryllium, lithium, and other critical minerals.

USA Rare Earth is making [aggressive moves](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/35095206/usa-rare-earth-accelerates-mine-to-magnet-strategy-with-the-transformative-acquisition-of-less-common-metals-lcm) to challenge China's dominance in the critical minerals sector through a transformative $100 million acquisition of UK-based LCM. The deal aims to complete an integrated mine-to-magnet supply chain that few Western companies can match.

LCM brings 30 years of proven operating experience and stands as the only scaled producer of samarium metal outside China. It currently operates with a capacity of 1,500 metric tons, with plans to expand to 20,000 metric tons over the next decade. This metal-making capability fills a critical gap in USA Rare Earth's supply chain, sitting between its Round Top heavy rare earth deposit in Texas and its 5,000-ton magnet production facility under construction in Stillwater, Oklahoma.

USA Rare Earth's Round Top deposit contains valuable heavy rare earths, such as terbium and dysprosium, which sell for hundreds to thousands of dollars per kilogram, compared to the cheaper light rare earths that competitor MP Materials produces.

The company raised $125 million through a common stock offering at $15 per share to fund the acquisition and ongoing expansion. Management expects to commission its first 600-metric-ton magnet production line in Q1 2026, with plans to reach 1,200 tons by the end of 2026. The company has signed memorandums of understanding with 12 customers and maintains a pipeline of 70 potential clients representing 5,000 to 7,000 metric tons of annual demand.

Out of the five analysts covering USAR stock, four recommend “Strong Buy,” and one recommends “Hold.” The average USAR stock price target is $19, which is above the current price of $17.20. 

# Ramaco Resources (METC)

Valued at a market cap of $2 billion, Ramaco Resources [(METC)](https://www.barchart.com/quotes/METC) develops, operates, and sells metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. It manages five major coal properties across West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming, totaling approximately 190,750 acres. Ramaco Resources [is transforming](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/33794822/ramaco-resources-q2-earnings-snapshot) from a pure metallurgical coal producer into a dual-platform company with a potentially game-changing rare earth and critical minerals operation. 

The company's Brook Mine in Wyoming represents America's first new rare earth mine in over 70 years and contains 1.7 million tons of total rare earth oxide across just one-third of its 16,000-acre property.

Unlike traditional hard rock deposits, the rare earths at Brook Mine are co-mingled with coal in soft material that's easier and cheaper to process. The deposit contains five of the seven rare earth elements recently banned from Chinese imports, including high-value heavy rare earths such as dysprosium and terbium, which are worth hundreds to thousands of dollars per kilogram. The mine also holds scandium, with Western aerospace customers reportedly willing to consume six times current demand if a secure domestic supply existed.

Fluor's preliminary economic analysis outlined a pretax net present value of $1.2 billion, with a 38% internal rate of return and a steady-state EBITDA of $143 million by 2029. The analysis also included initial capital costs of $473 million, excluding contingency. Ramaco has accelerated its timeline and now expects commercial oxide production in 2027 rather than 2028.

In the coal segment, second-quarter results showed cash costs of $103 per ton, placing Ramaco in the first quartile of the U.S. cost curve despite weak pricing. It achieved record production for the second consecutive quarter while temporarily idling its higher-cost Eagle mine. Management trimmed full-year sales guidance purely due to pricing weakness, refusing to sell tons at negative margins into oversupplied Asian spot markets.

Out of the four analysts covering METC stock, three recommend “Strong Buy,” and one recommends “Hold.” The average METC stock price target is $27.67, below the current price of $33. 

# NioCorp (NB)

The final stock on the list is NioCorp [(NB)](https://www.barchart.com/quotes/NB), which explores and develops mineral deposits in North America. Its [flagship mineral property](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/32102153/niocorp-engages-engineering-firms-to-update-elk-creek-project-feasibility-study) is the Elk Creek niobium, scandium, and titanium project that consists of a 227-acre parcel of land and associated mineral rights. It also owns an additional 80 acres of surface rights and 40 acres of mineral rights, as well as an optioned land package that covers an area of 1,272 acres located in Johnson County, southeast Nebraska. 

NioCorp is advancing its fully permitted Elk Creek project, which aims to become America's domestic source for multiple critical minerals currently imported almost entirely from other countries. 

The project's economics remain compelling, with $403 million in annual EBITDA over a 38-year mine life. However, these figures don't yet include the recently added rare earth production or the six times more titanium output resulting from an improved process flow. Management expects the updated feasibility study to show significantly improved numbers when it is released later this year.

NioCorp has raised over $152 million in 2025, maintaining a zero-debt balance sheet while advancing toward the final investment decision. It received a $10 million Department of Defense grant supporting reserve drilling, which will upgrade probable reserves to proven status, thereby reducing project risk. Nine drill holes are complete, with analytical results expected to be released on a hole-by-hole basis in the coming months.

Out of the three analysts covering NB stock, two recommend “Strong Buy,” and one recommends “Hold.” The average stock price target for NB is $6.62, which is below the current price of $6.68.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ⚡ Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance** → Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition** → Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts** → 2025 drilling added **9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)** plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

# NioCorp Ignition Sequence: Catalysts

* **Scandium Price Floor Set:** Pentagon’s $40M scandium oxide buy from Rio Tinto (\~$6,250/kg) validates scandium’s defense role. Elk Creek is the only U.S. project positioned to deliver at scale.
* **Capital Stockpiled:** $110M— funding momentum into Q4.
* **Government Tailwinds:** Pentagon stockpiling, EXIM/DFC windows, and potential U.S. equity stakes in strategic mineral firms. **(Lithium Americas latest!)**
* **Stacked Catalysts Ahead:** Munich conference, October drill results, scandium-alloy announcements, offtakes, updated DFS, and EXIM FID.
* **Strategic Convergence:** Niobium, scandium, titanium, and REEs — Elk Creek represents U.S. resource independence at scale.

🚨 **Washington just raised the stakes on critical minerals** — taking a 5% equity position in Lithium Americas. That precedent signals the U.S. government isn’t just talking about resource security anymore, it’s **deploying capital**. With Elk Creek, NioCorp controls the only U.S. project uniting **niobium, titanium/TiCl₄, scandium, and rare earths** under one roof. That’s not simply a mine plan — it’s a **strategic platform for U.S. sovereignty** across defense, EVs, aerospace, and clean energy.

October is where the narrative converges. NioCorp presents at the **Munich Mining Conference (Oct. 3–4)** and the **Critical Minerals Forum Summit in Washington, D.C. (Oct. 8, 11:05 AM ET)** — two stages that perfectly bracket its **drill results**, which could scale TREO toward **1,000,000 tonnes**. Those results will feed directly into the **Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS)** — a milestone that finalizes **capex, opex, NPV, RailVeyor efficiencies, and expanded reserves**. That’s the pivot where speculation ends and hard models lock in — providing the numbers institutional investors and strategic partners require to move.

Meanwhile, the Elk Creek district itself is being validated. **Apex’s land acquisition bordering NioCorp’s footprint** underlines the multi-metal potential, with Dahrouge’s role reinforcing a networked development strategy. Layer on **November alloy adoption announcements**, expected **EXIM/DFC financing decisions**, **Maxim’s PT boost to $12**, and mounting chatter of **government or prime contractor equity stakes** — and the ignition sequence is fully stacked. With catalysts aligned across policy, finance, and geology, **Q4 is the turning point — the launch window for Elk Creek. 🚀**

# NioCorp —is shaping into ~""The Flagship U.S. critical minerals hub!""~

# With drilling results due mid-October, Scandium alloy news in November, and a Q4 DFS into EXIM/DFC financing, the ignition sequence is stacked. 🚀

1nw151s,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedForYou/comments/1nw151s/can_ariel_powder_detergent_really_beat_stains_in/,Can Ariel Powder Detergent Really Beat Stains in One Wash?,"Testing out the Ariel 80339059 powder laundry detergent over several weeks in a bustling household revealed quite a lot about its performance, quirks, and effectiveness. I’ve run it through everything from a toddler’s messiest play clothes to delicate fabrics and office attire. This detergent isn’t just sitting in the laundry room—it’s becoming part of the family routine, and honestly, it’s been informative.

**Performance and Cleaning Power**  
The cleaning power is what initially drew me to this powder detergent. With two times the cleaning ingredients compared to standard bargain liquid detergents, it promises a reliable clean. And boy, does it deliver. That one mysterious yellow stain on my kid’s white shirt? Completely gone without a trace. Even after chocolate syrup and playground mud joined forces to ruin my weekend, this detergent cleaned everything up in one wash. It works equally well on whites as it does on colors, something not all detergents manage to pull off effectively.

**Ease of Use**  
Using it is as straightforward as laundry can get. Toss the powder into the drum, add clothes, and hit start—that’s it. It dissolves super-fast, even with cold water cycles, which I appreciate because not every detergent pulls this off without leaving clumps. After running this through a front-load HE washer, I noticed there’s no residue sticking around in the machine; it’s all completely dissolved. That’s definitely a plus for efficiency and convenience.

[Check Ariel 80339059 price on Amazon.](https://reviews.sanue.com/p/b0bjmlq7sw/)

**Target Users**  
This product seems tailor-made for families like mine or anyone tackling regular laundry loads with potentially tough stains. Activewear, kid messes, or even awkward coffee spills on my work shirt—the detergent handled it all. I feel it would do equally well in a dorm setting or with couples who appreciate a higher-performing option. Basically, if you’re someone whose daily life creates a variety of laundry challenges, this would be in your corner.

**Positives**  
- Consistently removes tough stains in a single wash.  
- Works efficiently on both whites and colors without fading.  
- Dissolves quickly, even in cold-water cycles or fast wash settings.  
- Compatible with both front-loading and top-loading machines.  

**Negatives**  
- The packaging isn’t resealable, and once opened, it can get messy.  
- The powder can occasionally create a fine dust cloud while measuring it out.  
- It’s slightly bulky compared to liquid options when lugging it around.  

**Scent and Residue**  
The original scent is noticeable but not overpowering, perfect for people who prefer a clean smell without smelling like a perfume counter exploded. My husband is picky about fragrances and even he didn’t mind the light, fresh scent lingering on his clothes. As for residue, I didn’t encounter any issues during my testing, and even sensitive skin in the family had no complaints.

**Competing Products**  
When stacking it up against other big-name detergents like Tide or Gain, Ariel outshines them in a few areas. The stain-removal power is comparable to both brands, but its rapid dissolution in cold water gives it the edge over powdered Gain. On the flip side, some liquid versions of Tide might be more convenient for those who don’t want to measure powder or deal with dust. However, Ariel remains impressively efficient in its stain-fighting capabilities, not to mention a bit more affordable in many cases.

**Cost Performance**  
Given what it offers, the detergent strikes a solid balance between quality and affordability. It’s built for practicality, and every measure feels like it’s targeted at achieving efficient cleanliness. While the bulkier pack size could be intimidating at first glance, its cost-effectiveness over smaller packs or liquid options makes it worthwhile in the long term. The bang-for-the-buck ratio hits just right.

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

They roast their coffee fresh and degass it for 20 days. After that they grind and ship it the same day. I was intrigued, so I immediately ordered a tasting set: 3 x 250 grams of single-origin coffees (Cuba, El Salvador & Colombia) and 1 x 250 grams of their original blend, they even gifted a tote bag also and all this pack was for bargain price so I thought it's a great deal.

When ordering, there was an option for grind size: Fine (espresso, moka pot...) So I chose this option. I'm at work right now and don't have a photo on my phone, but the coffee looks finer than the coffee I used that ""ground for mokapot"" written on it.

Question is;
The coffee comes out slower and tastes more intense, a bit bitter. I don't know if this is the intended taste, because I tried Cuba and its flavor profile listed dark chocolate and tobacco aromas.

# Recipe: Sentiment Analysis in SQLv2

## Problem

How do you quickly analyze what customers feel about your product without exporting data into Python or external ML services?

## What You’ll Learn

* Run sentiment analysis **directly in SQL**.
* Store results in your table for reporting and dashboards.

## Setup: Create a Feedback Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE customer_feedback (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name TEXT,
    comment TEXT,
    feedback_date DATE,
    sentiment_score TEXT
);
```

## Seed Example Data

```sql
INSERT INTO customer_feedback (id, customer_name, comment, feedback_date) VALUES
(1, 'Emma Wilson', 'Amazing headphones! Great sound quality.', '2025-01-12'),
(2, 'Michael Chen', 'Fast delivery but packaging was poor.', '2025-01-10'),
(3, 'Sarah Johnson', 'Coffee maker works fine but instructions unclear.', '2024-12-18'),
(4, 'David Rodriguez', 'Excellent support, solved my issue fast.', '2025-01-14');
```

## Run Sentiment Analysis

```sql
UPDATE customer_feedback
SET sentiment_score = SENTIMENT(comment);
```

This SQLv2 function runs **sentiment analysis inside the database**. No ETL, no Python, no API calls.

## See the Results

```sql
SELECT customer_name, comment, sentiment_score
FROM customer_feedback;
```

📊 Example Output:

* Emma Wilson → *Positive* (0.9)
* Michael Chen → *Neutral/Mixed* (0.2)
* Sarah Johnson → *Negative* (-0.3)
* David Rodriguez → *Positive* (0.8)

---

✅ **Takeaway:** In SQLv2, AI is part of the query. You don’t move data out to analyze sentiment — it happens where the data lives.

Visual chaos translates directly to professional chaos in their mind. Four different fonts and six competing colors? That’s not creativity — that’s confusion.

* Your profile photo needs to be clean.
* First-person perspective, proper lighting, and a background that doesn’t scream “I took this in my closet.”
* Everything should appear perfectly harmonious.

The bio formula is straightforward: make it immediately clear who you help, what transformation you deliver, and how you do it.

**The Formula: I** ***Help \[TARGET\] to \[RESULT\] with \[SERVICE/METHOD\]*****.**

You don’t need to follow this robotically, but these three elements must emerge within the first two lines.

You’ve already lost if I’m scrolling and can’t figure out whether you’re relevant to me.

Always include a link—Calendly, a custom booking page, or even a Tally form if you’re testing qualification approaches. The point is to give people a frictionless next step when they’re ready.

Here’s something most people get wrong about niching: you don’t need to box yourself into one vertical unless you have a damn good reason.

Real case studies, an existing network in that space, and direct experience are the reasons.

“I heard I should pick a niche” is not.

I run a strategic positioning on LinkedIn that’s deliberately horizontal while keeping Instagram focused exclusively on coaches and course creators. It’s the same core expertise expressed through different apertures.

**Don’t artificially limit yourself based on someone else’s playbook.**

# The Outreach Rhythm That Compounds

If you’re serious about building a client pipeline, you need to treat prospecting like the non-negotiable it is.

Before you send a single message, you need to observe.

Follow your potential clients/leads for seven to ten days.

Watch their stories, read their posts, see where they’re getting traction and where they’re struggling.

* The point isn’t to stalk them — it’s to find a legitimate hook that makes your outreach feel less like a cold pitch and more like a natural extension of an existing conversation.

Twenty-five new prospects (people you will contact) per week is the baseline. That breaks down to five per day if you’re working a standard Job, but honestly, once you’ve got your system down, you can knock out five quality touches in under an hour.

Your response rate is your truth meter. If you’re not getting at least 20–30% of people to reply, something’s broken. Either your targeting is off, your messaging is generic, or you’re leading with your offer instead of with value.

# Messages That Open Real Conversations

The interactions that actually convert aren’t built on flattery. They’re built on specific knowledge — something you noticed, something you can help with, something that positions you as a peer rather than a fan.

The three-beat structure is as follows:

* Start with a specific hook tied to something real they posted or said.
* Follow immediately with tangible value — a technical observation, a quick fix, or a strategic insight they can use right now.
* Close with a soft question or invitation that keeps the door open without forcing them through it.

Let me show you what doesn’t work.

I recently watched someone reach out to a nutritionist with this gem: “Really interesting content, congrats! Quick question — do you focus more on taste or nutritional value in your recipes?”

The nutritionist replied with “Both 🙂” and that was the end of it.

The message was polite, inoffensive, and completely forgettable. It didn’t give the nutritionist any reason to keep talking.

Now here’s what actually works.

I was following a SaaS founder who posted about switching their tech stack to Notion. I’d been in their position six months earlier.

I sent them a message: “Saw you’re moving everything into Notion — been there. The database relations are where most people get stuck. I built a client CRM template that handles the messy parts automatically. Two-minute setup. Want me to send it over?”

They replied in four minutes. We ended up on a call three days later. Why?

Because I led with something useful, positioned myself as someone who’d solved the same problem, and made the ask so low-friction they’d be stupid to say no.

Here’s another angle.

I’m watching a venture capital partner on LinkedIn who just published a breakdown of their investment thesis around AI tooling. I use three of the tools she mentioned daily.

I drop a comment on the post: “Sharp framework — especially the distribution velocity metric. We’ve been tracking similar patterns with our portfolio’s go-to-market execution.”

Then I slide into DMs: “Just commented on your AI thesis post. The distribution velocity angle is something we’re obsessing over right now. Curious — have you seen anyone successfully compress that 6–12 month adoption curve? We’ve got one client doing it in 90 days and I’m still trying to reverse-engineer how.”

Zero sales pressure. Professional to professional. They either engage because they’re genuinely curious, or they don’t — but either way, I’ve positioned myself as someone operating at their level.

**Critical point:** outreach isn’t about following a script. It’s about finding the most natural entry point into someone’s world.

If I’m based in Austin and I see a story from a fintech founder who’s also in Austin and just posted about the new coffee shop on South Congress, sometimes the best opener is just: “Just saw your story — is that the new place next to HomeSlice? Been meaning to check it out.”

Conversation unlocked. From there, it can evolve a thousand different ways, but the chat’s open and it happened naturally.

What kills these conversations are fake questions.

“How long have you been doing this?”

“Do you work more with individuals or businesses?”

These aren’t real questions — they’re interview fillers, and everyone can smell them from a mile away.

# You’re talking to a peer, not pitching to a prospect. The frame should always be: we’re two professionals discussing something we both care about. Not fan to creator. Not vendor to buyer. Peer to peer.

This means you should drop the deferential language immediately.

“If it would be convenient for you” and “whenever you have a moment” position you below them.

**You’re not below them.**

**You’re bringing value to the table. Speak like it.**

Pick topics where you actually have depth.

If you open with a strategic observation, make sure you can back it up with three more layers if they engage. Surface-level compliments followed by nothing substantial? That’s worse than not reaching out at all.

# Prospect Research & Competitive Intelligence

Every good message starts with good research. Before you reach out, you need to understand what they’ve already tried, what’s working, and where the friction points are.

* Study their bio.
* Look at their pinned stories.
* Map their funnel from awareness to conversion.
* Where does it break? Where does the prospect get confused or lose momentum?

These friction points are your entry opportunities.

When analysing competitors or reference accounts, don’t just steal their tactics. Understand why they work. What psychological lever are they pulling? What objection are they preemptively handling? What context makes this format effective for this audience? That understanding lets you adapt and improve, rather than copy and hope.

If you’re not tracking, you’re just hoping. And hope is not a client acquisition strategy.",1,1759403277.0,CopywritingAdvices,0,1.0,False

1nw0rk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxedOpinions/comments/1nw0rk5/explore_if_all_liquid_laundry_detergent_truly/,Explore if All Liquid Laundry Detergent Truly Helps Sensitive Skin,"There’s something special about testing products that claim to make everyday tasks simpler, and I recently had the pleasure of trying out the *all Liquid Laundry Detergent, Free Clear for Sensitive Skin, 237 Fluid Ounces*. I’ll admit I wasn’t familiar with this particular detergent before, but after diving in, my opinion is firmly set. Designed for those with sensitive skin, this detergent promises a gentle yet effective clean, and I set out to investigate whether it truly delivers.

**Ease of Use and Thoughtful Packaging**

Right from the start, the packaging caught my attention. The bottle, while housing an impressive 237 fluid ounces of liquid detergent, is surprisingly manageable. I initially thought, with a bottle this size, pouring it would turn into an Olympic sport, but the easy-pour spout made the process absolutely fuss-free. Plus, the built-in dosage cup ensures you’re not accidentally oversaturating your laundry with detergent; I’ve made that mistake with other brands and ended up with soapy residue. It doesn’t spill easily, even when the kids got their hands on it accidentally one morning—bonus points for mess prevention!

**Strengths**

- Hypoallergenic formula that caters to households with sensitive skin.  
- Free of artificial perfumes and dyes, truly odorless, making it an excellent choice for those averse to strong scents.  
- Thorough cleaning power, cutting through everyday stains like food spills, gym sweat, and even lingering pet odors without dulling colors.  

Should you wish to check current offers, [grab all Liquid Laundry Detergent on Amazon here.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b074j6wwn3/)

**Performance: Does It Get the Job Done?**

The effectiveness of this product certainly had me intrigued, especially given its “Free Clear” formula. I mainly tested it on my family’s usual mess magnets: my toddler’s mucky bibs, my partner’s workout shirts, and even some sheets that endured an unfortunate coffee accident. To my surprise, it handled all of these exceptionally well. All stains vanished without scrubbing! The formula seemed gentle enough to leave no rashes on my nephew's arms, something he’s battled before with other detergents. However, it’s worth noting that it struggled a bit with older, set-in stains like ink—though, honestly, most detergents do.

**Drawbacks**

- Slightly bulky for smaller laundry setups, especially if you’re used to compact pods.  
- Struggled a bit with very stubborn, older stains (like ink or oil).  
- The detergent’s runny consistency means you’ll need to be careful when pouring into machines without spill containment.  

**Target User: Great for Sensitive Skin, But…**

If you or your little ones have sensitive skin, this detergent is practically tailor-made. My cousin’s newborn has eczema issues, so she borrowed it for a few loads of cloth diapers. They came out fresh, and there were no reactions whatsoever. That said, people with larger families should beware: while the big bottle size is excellent value, you’ll need decent storage space, as it isn’t exactly compact. Urban apartments, this is your cue to evaluate your shelf space.

**Competing Brands**

When stacking the detergent against competitors like *Tide Free & Gentle* or *Seventh Generation Free & Clear*, noticeable differences arise. Tide’s counterpart is also hypoallergenic and works well but leaves a faint scent that might deter those looking for a completely fragrance-free experience. Meanwhile, Seventh Generation shines in its eco-friendliness, but I found its cleaning prowess lacking when dealing with the tougher stains this product tackles head-on. Out of the three, *all Free Clear* strikes a good middle ground—it’s affordable, effective, and considerate to sensitive skin.

**Price Performance**

Cost rarely tells the full story without context, but this big bottle does suggest value at first glance. When comparing its per-use cost to single-use pod alternatives, the savings are compelling. It’s definitely a wise choice for households that rely on multiple loads weekly, though I’d argue that smaller households could opt for something more compact unless they don’t mind storing large quantities.

1nw0qf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/1nw0qf6/take_get_ultimate_verb_guide_as_a_native_korean_i/,"[TAKE & GET: Ultimate Verb Guide] As a native Korean, I want to talk about TAKE and GET. We have a big problem with these words, too.","I wanted to share something you might find interesting. When native Koreans learn English, two of the hardest basic verbs for us to master are ""take"" and ""get.""

It might sound strange to you. But the reason is simple. In Korean, we don't really have these kinds of all-purpose verbs. We can't just say ""take a bus"", ""take medicine"", and ""take a picture"" with one word. Each situation requires a completely different and specific verb.

So, I'm sure it's just as **frustrating for you** when you try to translate ""take"" or ""get"" into Korean, just like us. You look in the dictionary and the answer just doesn't feel right in a real conversation. I have even seen a post about this in this subreddit recently, and people have been discussing about 'take' in the comments:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/1ntshcd/i\_keep\_having\_issues\_with\_sentence\_structure\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/1ntshcd/i_keep_having_issues_with_sentence_structure_and/)

by u/Specific_Coconut_228

The most important tip I can give you is this. Stop trying to translate the word. Start translating the situation. Instead of thinking ""How do I say take?"", you should think ""What is the actual action/meaning happening here?"", then choose a right verb. For example,

* With a bus, the action is ""to ride"" (타다). So ""take a bus"" is 버스를 ""타다"".
* With a class, the action is 'to listen' (듣다). So ""take a class"" is 수업을 ""듣다"".
* When getting a coffee, you actually BUY a coffee, so ""커피를 사다""

There are so many verbs in Korean to convey the meaning of ""take"" or ""get"".

Memorizing it from the below list is great, but it would be even way better to see as ***dialogue videos*** ***with context/environment/emotion*** of people when verbs are used, together with my voice explanations and pronounciations. I spent a lot of time making a dialogue videos about this to choose a good dialogue, and I made 65+ dialogue video examples to show how it is used in real life. I tried hard to cover almost every situations I could think of. Also, video contains more than ""take"" and ""get"". Please check them out.

Once I started college I had this sudden switch. I remember tossing and turning a few nights one week and thinking huh I must have had too much caffeine (even though back then I could drink 5 cups of coffee and sleep for 8 hours)but it just kept happening, and getting progressively worse.

I assume it has something to do with the added stress of school but other than that I have no clue why or how I could fully switch like that.

1nw0mnc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nw0mnc,HunyuanImage 3 vs Qwen comparison,"Hi all,

Another test I made, with no scientific pretense!

  
EDIT: the more visible cherry-picked image result of Qwen are in below in the comments.

Admittedly, Qwen is even more at a disavantage in this test because I used the FP8 model, but then on the platform HY's resolution is limited to 1 megapixel.

I generated an idea of an image and asked a LLM to elaborate a prompt about it (so my lack of fluency with English won't trouble the model). I'll provide the list of prompts below, with some commentary on the result.

In the accompagnying images, I cherry-picked the Hunyuan result (out of the 2 generated on the official website, since I don't have a B200 lying around at home) but generated 8 random Qwen results. With the limitation on images posted in a single thread, I can't do more but I'll be happy to provide the full resolution version of some of them.

This comparison isn't meant to be applicable to anyone's use case, especially when it comes to assessing if it's worth renting a top-level runpod to run it, but it may help show some differences between the newcomer and the current star.

**Prompt #1: It's a reasoning model... the classroom**

First, I wanted to illustrate why the HY model is huge: it doesn't do only image generation but also understanding. It should be better at it than image-only model. I asked for:

""A classroom filled with students, each holding up a small chalkboard with their answer to the equation x-7=5 written on it. The teacher is visible from behind, facing the students.""

Hunyuan produced slates with actual results, while Qwen was expectedly limited to working with what was in the prompt. But Qwen also had a probem with the orientation of the children and slates in many cases.

**Prompt 2: the cyberpunk selfie**

""A hyper-detailed, cinematic close-up selfie shot in a cyberpunk megacity environment, framed as if taken with a futuristic augmented-reality smartphone. The composition is tight on three young adults—two women and one man—posing together at arm’s length, their faces illuminated by the neon chaos of the city. The photo should feel gritty, futuristic, and authentic, with ultra-sharp focus on the faces, intricate skin textures, reflections of neon lights, cybernetic implants, and the faint atmospheric haze of rain-damp air. The background should be blurred with bokeh from glowing neon billboards, holograms, and flickering advertisements in colors like electric blue, magenta, and acid green.

The first girl, on the left, has warm bronze skin with micro-circuit tattoos faintly glowing along her jawline and temples, like embedded circuitry under the skin. Her eyes are hazel, enhanced with subtle digital overlays, tiny lines of data shimmering across her irises when the light catches them. Her hair is thick, black, and streaked with neon blue highlights, shaved at one side to reveal a chrome-plated neural jack. Her lips curve into a wide smile, showing a small gold tooth cap that reflects the neon light. The faint glint of augmented reality lenses sits over her pupils, giving her gaze a futuristic intensity.

The second girl, on the right, has pale porcelain skin with freckles, though some are replaced with delicate clusters of glowing nano-LEDs arranged like constellations across her cheeks. Her face is angular, with sharp cheekbones accentuated by the high-contrast neon lighting. She has emerald-green cybernetic eyes, with a faint circular HUD visible inside, and a subtle lens flare effect in the pupils. Her lips are painted matte black, and a silver septum ring gleams under violet neon light. Her hair is platinum blonde with iridescent streaks, straight and flowing, with strands reflecting holographic advertisements around them. She tilts her head toward the lens with a half-smile that looks playful yet dangerous, her gaze almost predatory.

The man, in the center and slightly behind them, has tan skin with a faint metallic sheen at the edges of his jaw where cybernetic plating meets flesh. His steel-gray eyes glow faintly with artificial enhancement, thin veins of light radiating outward like cracks of electricity. A faint scar cuts across his left eyebrow, but it is partially reinforced with a chrome implant. His lips form a confident smirk, a thin trail of smoke curling upward from the glowing tip of a cyber-cig between his fingers. His hair is short, spiked with streaks of neon purple, slightly wet from the drizzle. He wears a black jacket lined with faintly glowing circuitry that pulses like veins of light across his collar.

The lighting is moody and saturated with neon: electric pinks, blues, and greens paint their faces in dynamic contrasts. Droplets of rain cling to their skin and hair, catching the neon glow like tiny prisms. Reflections of holographic ads shimmer in their eyes. Subtle lens distortion from the selfie framing makes the faces slightly exaggerated at the edges, adding realism.

The mood is rebellious, electric, and hyper-modern, blending candid warmth with the raw edge of a cyberpunk dystopia. Despite the advanced tech, the moment feels intimate: three friends, united in a neon-drenched world of chaos, capturing a fleeting instant of humanity amidst the synthetic glow.""

While this prompt was expectedly too difficult for both models, Hunyuan got a lot of the right (the shaved area and piercing for the left girl, the cigarette on the man, the localized freckles on the right girl) or closer (the hair). While several of them were missed by model, like eyes, I feel Hunyuan is closer than Qwen on this one.

**Prompt #3: the renaissance technosaint**

""A grand Renaissance-style oil painting, as if created by a master such as Caravaggio or Raphael, depicting an unexpected modern subject: a hacker wearing a VR headset, portrayed with the solemn majesty of a religious figure. The painting is composed with a dramatic chiaroscuro effect: deep shadows dominate the background while radiant golden light floods the central figure, symbolizing revelation and divine inspiration.

The hacker sits at the center of the canvas in three-quarter view, clad in simple dark clothing that contrasts with the rich fabric folds often seen in Renaissance portraits. His hands are placed reverently on an open laptop that resembles an illuminated manuscript. His head is bowed slightly forward, as if in deep contemplation, but his face is obscured by a sleek black VR headset, which gleams with reflected highlights. Despite its modernity, the headset is rendered with the same meticulous brushwork as a polished chalice or crown in a sacred altarpiece.

Around the hacker’s head shines a halo of golden light, painted in radiant concentric circles, recalling the divine aureoles of saints. This halo is not traditional but fractured, with angular shards of digital code glowing faintly within the gold, blending Renaissance piety with cybernetic abstraction. The golden light pours downward, illuminating his hands and casting luminous streaks across his laptop, making the device itself appear like a holy relic.

The background is dark and architectural, suggesting the stone arches of a cathedral interior, half-lost in shadow. Columns rise in the gloom, while faint silhouettes of angels or allegorical figures appear in the corners, holding scrolls that morph into glowing data streams. The palette is warm and rich: ochres, umbers, deep carmines, and the brilliant gold of divine illumination. Subtle cracks in the painted surface give it the patina of age, as if this sacred image has hung in a chapel for centuries.

The style should be authentically Renaissance: textured oil brushstrokes, balanced composition, dramatic use of light and shadow, naturalistic anatomy. Every detail of fabric, skin, and light is rendered with reverence, as though this hacker is a prophet of the digital age. The VR headset, laptop, and digital motifs are integrated seamlessly into the sacred iconography, creating an intentional tension between the ancient style and the modern subject.

The mood is sublime, reverent, and paradoxical: a celebration of knowledge and vision, as if technology itself has become a vessel of divine enlightenment. It should feel both anachronistic and harmonious, a painting that could hang in a Renaissance chapel yet unmistakably belongs to the cyber age.""

Then again, a lot of misses, especially when it comes to the style, but Hunyuan gets closer when it comes to the number of details taken into account.

**Prompt #4: mixing photorealistic and cartoony**

""A hyper-realistic, photographic depiction of a luxurious Parisian penthouse living room at night, captured in sharp detail with cinematic lighting. The space is ultra-modern, sleek, and stylish, with floor-to-ceiling glass windows that stretch the entire wall, overlooking the glittering Paris skyline. The Eiffel Tower glows in the distance, its lights shimmering against the night sky. The interior design is minimalist yet opulent: polished marble floors, a low-profile Italian leather sofa in charcoal gray, a glass coffee table with chrome legs, and a suspended designer fireplace with a soft orange flame casting warm reflections across the room. Subtle decorative accents—abstract sculptures, high-end books, and a large contemporary rug in muted tones—anchor the aesthetic.

Into this elegant, hyperrealistic scene intrudes something utterly fantastical and deliberately out of place: a cartoonish, classic Santa Claus sneaking across the room on tiptoe. He is rendered in a vintage 1940s–1950s cartoon style, with exaggerated rounded proportions, oversized boots, bright red suit, comically bulging belly, fluffy white beard, and a sack of toys slung over his back. His expression is mischievous yet playful, eyes wide and darting as if he’s been caught in the act. His red suit has bold, flat shading and thick black outlines, making him look undeniably drawn rather than photographed.

The contrast between the realistic environment and the cartoony Santa is striking: the polished marble reflects the glow of the fireplace realistically, while Santa casts a simple, flat, 2D-style shadow that doesn’t quite match the physical lighting, enhancing the surreal ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" effect. His hotte (sack of toys) bounces with exaggerated squash-and-stretch animation style, defying the stillness of the photorealistic room.

Through the towering glass windows behind him, another whimsical element appears: Santa’s sleigh hovering in mid-air, rendered in the same vintage cartoon style as Santa. The sleigh is pulled by reindeer that flap comically oversized hooves, frozen mid-leap in exaggerated poses, with little puffs of animated smoke trailing behind them. The glowing neon of Paris reflects off the glass, mixing realistically with the flat, cel-shaded cartoon outlines of the sleigh, heightening the uncanny blend of real and drawn worlds.

The overall mood is playful and surreal, balancing luxury and absurdity. The image should feel like a carefully staged photograph of a high-end penthouse, interrupted by a cartoon character stepping right into reality. The style contrast must be emphasized: photographic realism in the architecture, textures, and city view, versus cartoon simplicity in Santa and his sleigh. This juxtaposition should create a whimsical tension, evoking the exact “Roger Rabbit effect”: two incompatible realities colliding in one frame, yet blending seamlessly into a single narrative moment.""

Here we get Hunyuy who was unable to draw Santa Claus vehicle without Santa Claus itself, which is a big mistake. Qwen got it right half of the time. But the instruction about details are then again in favour of HY, like reflections and so on. Models used to have a hard time doing reflection, now they have trouble when we ask them not to put them where they should. Qwen does a much better Parisian skyline than Hunyuan, though.

**Prompt #5: the space station**

""A giant space station drifting in the void, designed with a mixture of futuristic architecture and retro sci-fi aesthetics. The overall shape is elongated and asymmetrical, with a huge central dome dominating the upper surface. The dome is made of multiple hexagonal glass panels, glowing softly in shades of green and turquoise, giving the impression of a crystalline turtle shell set into the metallic hull.

Around the dome, the station expands outward into broad mechanical platforms and clusters of interconnected modules. These structures are heavily detailed with engine blocks, exhaust vents, antenna arrays, docking bays, and mechanical scaffolding. Some sections look like enormous ventilation grids or cooling systems, with dark rectangular openings. The metal surfaces are mostly silver and gray, with subtle hints of violet and blue, accented by scattered red and yellow lights.

At the station’s edges, several branch-like arms extend outward, ending in spherical or circular constructions resembling observation pods or secondary control stations. Tubes and conduits snake across the hull, linking different sectors together. Small auxiliary spacecraft and shuttles can be imagined buzzing around the structure, emphasizing its immense scale.

The overall design combines smooth curved surfaces with hard angular machinery, producing a look that is both organic and mechanical. The central dome feels serene and geometric, while the surrounding machinery bristles with complexity and technical detail.

The background is the blackness of deep space, punctuated by bright stars, scattered planets, and colorful nebula clouds. Shades of blue and indigo swirl faintly behind the station, contrasting with the cold gray metal and the green glow of the dome.

The visual style should be sharp, clean, and vibrant, with bold outlines and saturated colors, giving the station a crisp, iconic silhouette. The scene conveys a mood of cosmic adventure and mystery, as though the station is both a fortress and a sanctuary drifting among the stars.""

Two very different styles, and I feel Qwen misses the complexity mark on this one.

**Prompt #5: the mad scientist and his captive**

""A dark, cinematic laboratory interior filled with strange machinery and glowing chemical tanks. At the center of the composition stands a large transparent glass cage, reinforced with metallic frames and covered in faint reflections of flickering overhead lights. Inside the cage is a young blonde woman serving as a test subject from a zombification expermient. Her hair is shoulder-length, messy, and illuminated by the eerie light of the environment. She wears a simple, pale hospital-style gown, clinging slightly to her figure in the damp atmosphere. Her face is partly visible but blurred through the haze, showing a mixture of fear and resignation.

From nozzles built into the walls of the cage, a dense green gas hisses and pours out, swirling like toxic smoke. The gas quickly fills the enclosure, its luminescent glow obscuring most of the details inside. Only fragments of the woman’s silhouette are visible through the haze: the outline of her raised hands pressed against the glass, the curve of her shoulders, the pale strands of hair floating in the mist. The gas is so thick it seems to radiate outward, tinting the entire scene in sickly green tones.

Outside the cage, in the foreground, stands a mad scientist. He has an eccentric, unkempt appearance: wild, frizzy gray hair sticking in all directions, a long lab coat stained with chemicals, and small round glasses reflecting the glow of the cage. His expression is maniacally focused, a grin half-hidden as he scribbles furiously into a leather-bound notebook. The notebook is filled with incomprehensible diagrams and notes, his pen moving fast as if documenting every second of the experiment. One hand holds the notebook against his hip, while the other moves quickly, writing with obsessive energy.

The laboratory itself is cluttered and chaotic: wires snake across the floor, glass beakers bubble with strange liquids, and metallic instruments hum with faint vibrations. The lighting is dramatic, mostly coming from the cage itself and the glowing gas, creating sharp shadows and streaks of green reflected on the scientist’s glasses and lab coat.

The atmosphere is oppressive and heavy, like a scene from a gothic science-fiction horror film. The key effect is the visual contrast: the young woman’s fragile form almost lost in the swirling toxic mist, versus the sharp, manic figure of the scientist calmly taking notes as if this cruelty is nothing more than data collection.

The overall mood: unsettling, surreal, and cinematic—a blend of realism and nightmarish exaggeration, with the gas obscuring most details, making the viewer struggle to see clearly what happens within the glass cage.""

While it's far from perfect, notably with the glowing glasses of the mad scientist instead of just reflecting a subtle glow, HY gets most of the details right.... except that Qwen misses more, notably by not getting the reanimating gas kept inside the glass cage, and the victim look more combative than zombified.

**Prompt #6 : the slasher movie VHS cover**

""A cinematic horror movie poster in 1980s slasher style, set in a dark urban alley lit by a single flickering neon sign. In the forefront, a teenage girl in retro-mirror skates looks, freeze mid-motion, her eyes wide mouth and open in a scream. Her outfit is colorful and vintage: striped knee socks, denim shorts, and a T-shirt with bold 80s print. She is dramatically backlit, casting a long shadow across the wet pavement. Towering behind her is the silhouette of a masked killer, wearing a grimy hockey mask that hides his face completely. He wields a long gleaming samurai sword, raised menacingly, the blade catching the light, impaling the girl. On both side of the girl, the wound gushes with blood. The killer's body language is threatening and powerful, while the girl's posture conveys shock and helplessness. The entire composition feels like a horror movie still: mist curling around the street, neon reflections in puddles, posters peeling from walls brick. The colors are highly saturated in 80s horror style — neon pinks, blood reds, sickly greens. At the bottom of the image, bold block letters spell out a fake horror movie title, though this was a vintage VHS cover.""

I won't diss Qwen for the title of the VHS cover, because the full model does better with letters generally, so it can't really be blamed. But it seems to have refused to actually kill the girl. HY doesn't want to show her impaled either. I had to modify the prompt myself because ChatGPT told me that including blood in the description would turn this description into a forbidden topic for ""obvious ethical and safety concern"". Teen slashers movie are probably not a thing in America.

**Prompt #7: the naval battle**

""A dramatic and surreal naval battle at sea: a classic 17th-century wooden pirate ship, bristling with sails and black flags, attacking a modern aircraft carrier. The pirate ship is rendered in meticulous detail: weathered wooden hull, tattered sails flapping in the wind, and a black flag with a white skull-and-crossbones snapping at the mast. Cannons line the deck, firing bursts of smoke and flame, their iron cannonballs arcing toward the steel giant.

The aircraft carrier, enormous and gray, dominates the horizon with its flat deck, radar towers, and lines of modern fighter jets. Its deck crew runs in panic, scattering as the impossible wooden galleon barrels forward, waves crashing against its bow. Anti-aircraft guns swivel, opening fire, but the pirate ship cuts through cannon fire like a relic of another time made flesh.

The sky is stormy, filled with dark clouds and lightning, adding chaos to the scene. Rain lashes down, streaking across sails and steel alike. The sea itself heaves violently, with enormous waves tossing both ships in opposite rhythms: the pirate ship rides high on a crest, its wooden figurehead snarling toward the carrier, while the aircraft carrier plows stubbornly through the water, massive but unwieldy.

On the pirate ship’s deck, figures in bandanas, tricorn hats, and ragged coats reload cannons and brandish cutlasses, shouting wildly. Some aim muskets toward the carrier’s control tower. The contrast is absurd yet exhilarating: barefoot sailors with swords versus a modern war machine. Smoke from cannon fire and gun turrets mingles with lightning strikes, creating a surreal haze.

The overall mood is epic, chaotic, and anachronistic, as though history itself has torn open, bringing two naval ages into direct, impossible conflict. The scene feels like a painting of glorious insanity, where romance and brutality collide on the open sea.""

I'd say it's a general miss of give the point to Qwen here (the cherry picked best of 8 is superior to that).

**Prompt 8: the alien at the grocery store**

""A hyper-detailed illustration set inside a modern supermarket, captured in a semi-photorealistic style. Fluorescent lights bathe the scene in a cold, slightly sterile glow. Shelves overflow with familiar goods: cereal boxes stacked in bright rows, fruit in green plastic bins, bottled water, and colorful promotional signs hanging from the ceiling. The central focus is the checkout counter, where a young cashier in a simple uniform is scanning groceries, entirely unbothered.

At the conveyor belt stands a customer who is unmistakably an alien, but somehow treated as though he were an ordinary shopper. He holds a plastic basket and arranges items onto the belt with meticulous care: cans of soup, bags of rice, and a carton of milk.

The alien’s physique is profoundly non-human. His body is tall and elongated, nearly 2.3 meters, wrapped in a long coat that seems adapted for concealing his unusual frame. His skin, visible around the neck and hands, is deeply textured like chitin, shimmering with iridescent hues—green, bronze, and violet depending on how the light hits. His arms are slightly too long, ending in four-jointed fingers, each tipped with a claw-like nail that taps lightly against the plastic basket as he moves.

His head is elongated and asymmetrical, slightly bulbous at the back, tapering toward a narrow chin. The skull is ridged with subtle bioluminescent lines that pulse faintly beneath the skin, as though thin veins of light run through him. His eyes are enormous, faceted like an insect’s, shimmering with thousands of tiny lenses in shifting shades of amber and crimson. No eyelids blink—his gaze is unbroken, wide, and alien.

To blend into human society, he wears a respiratory mask covering his mouth and lower face. The mask is clearly not human-made: it’s composed of dark, matte metal plates fused with tubes that curl outward, connecting to a small filtration unit strapped against his chest. The mask releases faint hisses of vapor every few seconds, as though compensating for Earth’s atmosphere. Its design is angular, insectoid, almost like a second jaw grafted onto his face.

Despite his unsettling presence, the alien behaves with total calm and politeness. He holds a small wallet with his oversized hands, ready to pay like anyone else. His posture is upright, but his elongated body arcs slightly forward, making him look like he’s perpetually leaning closer than comfortable.

Meanwhile, the cashier remains utterly indifferent. She slides groceries across the scanner, the digital beep echoing in the sterile air. Her expression is bored, as though she sees nothing unusual. Behind the alien, a few human shoppers wait in line, glancing at their phones or carts, oblivious or willfully ignoring the strangeness.

The overall mood is surreal and uncanny: the perfect banality of everyday shopping disrupted by a figure so alien it should be impossible to ignore—yet within the image, he is treated as completely ordinary. The lighting is flat and supermarket-plain, which only heightens the bizarre contrast between the ordinary scene and the extraordinary customer.""

The cashier booth seems odd, the writing is haphazard, and the alien is missing its mouthpiece... but HY gets a few details better than Qwen again. It consistently does 4 fingers in a hand, which models have generally tried to avoid and learn once and for all that hands have 5 fingers...

**Prompt #9: the dimensional portal**

""A cinematic urban scene at night, set in a modern Asian metropolis resembling Tokyo, filled with neon lights, bustling traffic, and crowded streets. The sidewalks are lined with glowing signs in bright kanji-style characters, vending machines, and people caught mid-motion. A row of green taxis dominates the street, their headlights reflecting on the wet asphalt. The city atmosphere is dense, vibrant, and realistic, with shimmering reflections of neon pink, cyan, and green across puddles.

At the center of the street, reality itself fractures: a massive glowing dimensional portal has opened, hovering like a swirling ellipse of energy. The edges of the portal shimmer with unstable arcs of electricity, rippling outward in hues of violet, teal, and white. The portal does not simply shine—it reveals an entirely different world inside, as if the glass of reality has cracked open.

From within the portal bursts a young woman from the 19th century, mounted on a horse in full gallop. She is dressed in Victorian riding attire: a dark fitted jacket with brass buttons, a long flowing skirt tailored for horseback, leather gloves, and a small feathered hat pinned to her blonde hair. Her expression is intense and focused as she leans forward, urging the horse onward. The horse itself is powerful and elegant, its hooves already crossing the threshold into the modern street, scattering sparks of portal energy as it leaps.

Through the open portal, the background of another dimension is visible: a desolate, ruined world with shattered buildings, twisted barren trees, and an inverted sky filled with ominous clouds glowing faintly red. The landscape feels lifeless and hostile, littered with rubble and unnatural growths. The colors inside the portal are colder and more sinister than the city outside, creating a jarring visual contrast.

The scene is lit by a clash of worlds: the warm neon of the city bathes the taxis and streets, while the eerie glow of the portal casts unnatural shadows across the horse and rider. The bystanders in the city are caught frozen in awe and fear, blurred in the periphery, emphasizing the action of the rider and the surreal energy of the event.

The mood is dramatic, otherworldly, and kinetic—a collision of centuries and dimensions, where the hyper-modern urban realism of the city collides violently with the Victorian past and a ruined alternate universe. The viewer’s eye is drawn to the horse and rider breaking through the glowing portal, the perfect embodiment of two worlds clashing in one breathtaking instant.""

This one was easier, but Hunyuan gets a few ones better: the lack of continuity of what is behind the portal the rest of the image, the location of the rider (just crossing the portal). Qwen depicts a better two-way street, though.

**Prompt #10: shot through the ceiling**

A young girl  tumble from a jagged hole in the ceiling, her small body suspended mid-fall, arms flailing while her long chestnut hair streams upward as though caught in a sudden updraft. She wears a pale cotton dress, simple and slightly wrinkled, the hemp fluttering wildly around her knees as she plunges. Her face is a portrait of surprise and fear, wide hazel eyes staring into the unknown lips, her parted as if mid-gasp. Beside her, a sleek black cat twists and arches, claws extended as although searching for purpose, its green eyes glinting in the half-light. Both are frozen in that fragile instant of descent, their outlines illuminated by the stark contrast of plaster dust and neon glow. They fall into an opulent living room, decorated with refined taste and warm ambient lighting. The girl’s pale dress and scuffed leather shoes seem out of place against the grandeur of velvet upholstery and polished marble surfaces. A velvet sofa in deep burgundy anchors the space, surrounded by glass tables that catch the golden shimmer of a sculptural chandelier overhead. Cushions scatter as if startled by the intrusion, while the cat’s trajectory points it straight toward the rug below. The girl, however, appears weightless and delicate, as though she might have the echo against such refinement. The room opens towards a vast corner window that stretches from floor to ceiling, to reveal the glowing skyline of a modern metropolis. Skyscrapers stand like gleaming monoliths, their facades awash in neon pinks, silvers, and electric blues. Hovering vehicles trace faint lines of light across the night sky. Against this futuristic backdrop, the girl’s old-fashioned dress and bare scraped knees give her an anachronistic, almost storybook presence, like a character who has stumbled from another time into this sleek, unyielding world. Details heighten the dreamlike tension: fragments of plaster hover like a cloud around her slender form, dust motes glowing in the chandelier's warmth; a Persian rug, richly patterned in crimson and gold, directly below her trajectory, as if to cushion or entrap her fall. A half-open book rests on a nearby table, its pages ruffled by the movement of air, as though the apartment itself is holding its breath. The girl's hair and dress ripple in the invisible currents, her face caught between terror and wonder, as if uncertain whether she has stepped into a nightmare or a fantastical new beginning.

1nw0fdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nw0fdi/which_portable_mug_warmer_should_i_choose_for/,Which portable mug warmer should I choose for daily use?,"Hey everyone! I've been using a mug warmer for about six months now, and I can't believe I went so long without one. As someone who constantly forgets about their coffee until it's cold (we've all been there), this little device has been a game-changer for my daily routine.

I spent weeks researching different options before making my purchase, and I want to share what I learned to help others make an informed decision. There are tons of mug warmers out there, but not all of them are worth your money.

First, let me tell you what to look for:

Temperature Control:
The best mug warmers have adjustable temperature settings. You don't want something that'll burn your drink or keep it lukewarm. I found some great options that maintain the perfect temperature at https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer

Auto Shut-off:
This is non-negotiable for me. I'm forgetful, and having a device that turns off automatically after a few hours gives me peace of mind.

Size and Portability:
Consider where you'll use it. I have one for my desk at work and another at home. Make sure it's compact enough for your space but large enough to fit your favorite mug.

Build Quality:
Look for waterproof designs with good heat distribution. Cheap ones often have cold spots or stop working after a few months.

From my experience, there are a few common issues to watch out for:
- Some warmers only work with flat-bottom mugs
- Others heat unevenly or take forever to warm up
- Many cheaper models don't last long

After trying several options, I found some excellent choices at https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer that tick all these boxes. They're well-made, reliable, and actually keep your drink at the right temperature.

Power consumption is another factor to consider. Most good mug warmers use about 17-20 watts, which is pretty efficient. They're basically like running a small LED bulb.

Pro tip: If you're using it at work, get one with an indicator light so you can easily see when it's on. Trust me, it's super helpful during busy days.

I also recommend getting one with a wider base - it's more stable and reduces the risk of spills. And if you're clumsy like me, you'll appreciate this feature!

The price range for quality mug warmers is typically between $20-40. Anything much cheaper might not last long, and anything more expensive usually just adds unnecessary fancy features.

Final thoughts: Don't just go for the cheapest option. A good mug warmer is worth spending a little extra on, especially if you drink hot beverages throughout the day. It'll save you from multiple trips to the microwave and keep your drinks at the perfect temperature.

* I can debug code but not relationships (yet 😅).
* I spend more time with my laptop than with humans.
* Coffee runs in my veins, not blood.

Now, I’m at that stage where family is saying *“beta, shaadi ka socho”*, and I’m like, *“Alright, let’s deploy this feature in 8–12 months.”*   
Here’s the catch (and my only funny demand): I’m looking for a **girl who’s 6ft tall** (yes, you can finally reach that top kitchen shelf without a stool).  
  
Other than height jokes, what matters most:

* Family-oriented values 🤝
* Can handle a bug (in code or in life) without panicking
* Bonus points if you’re also in tech, but not required

In return, I bring:

* A stable career in software engineering
* Decent sense of humor (you decide in comments)
* Plan for marriage in the next 8–12 months (no endless “beta abhi time hai” loop).

He is super sweet and we are planning to move in together soon, but I have this feeling of him being unfaithful?

I have caught him lying before like how in the beginning he lied about were he lived. I kept wanting to come over to see his place and he would just say his roommate was always around. Finally he said was thinking of moving back into his parents place. Well come to find out he was still living with his parents. 

I have also caught him still being on tinder after just a couple months of him asking me being his gf. I had a sinking feeling at the time because I was lucky enough to get a text message that night. I always believe in second chances and moved on in our relationship.

It's happening again I don't hear from him until before bed, he doesn't have a job at the moment and is going to school Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays. All of the sudden the past 2 and this coming Saturday his friends aren't busy to play D&D, even though the year that we've been dating they've been too busy that's what he has told me.

Also I made a new Instagram account because my old one got banned for BS stuff, I was going to surprise him by showing him my account and I asked him to see his phone. He started to get super defensive on giving his phone to me, I kept telling him I wouldn't see his photos or messages. That I wanted to show him something on Instagram and he can see me do it if he wants, we were at Chick-fil-A sitting next to each other so could easily see what I'm doing. Finally I told him I just wanted him to follow me on my new Instagram and how he was acting suspicious. He said he just didn't want me to see his porn cuz he was watching some the other night. Another thing is he haven't done it for over a month. . . 

I love that he's goofy, makes me laugh every time we're together, always takes me out when we hangout, he brings me coffee or lunch at work because he hasn't seen me at work in a minute which is usually every other week, he keeps updating me on the home he remodeling for us to move in (he has taken me to the home), he hugs/kisses me when we happen to see each other at the gym even when I'm all sweaty, and I have dinner with his family about once a month. He just recently left his job to focus on his schooling and told him we don't need to go out every weekend to save him some money, but he said had plenty saved that I don't need to worry. Everyone in my life says he's the one.

1nw021i,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1nw021i/my_experience_as_an_almost_pregnant_person_with/,My experience as an “almost” pregnant person with migraines,"Recently I’ve started reflecting on an experience I had a few years ago before getting pregnant, where several doctors would not take my migraine symptoms seriously simply because I ASPIRED TO EVENTUALLY be pregnant. 



Two years ago I had a laparoscopy for endometriosis. Two weeks after surgery I started vomiting nonstop. Anything and everything would trigger it - smells, lights, coffee, driving, my computer. Every normal thing I did to EXIST triggered vomiting. 


It seemed like a mystery disease at first and my doctors were at a loss. I consulted my surgeon, my gastroenterologist, my family doctor and finally a neurologist. All came to a conclusion that my vomiting was not related to the surgery (because it started weeks later) and was likely migraines.




The problem is, I had the laparoscopy so I could complete an IVF cycle to get pregnant, so my doctors insisted I only try meds that were pregnancy-safe. The puking continued and I was getting desperate - I BEGGED my neurologist to try something else but they insisted I only try things that I could continue using in the pregnancy. I told them I was in no condition to be pregnant because I can’t stop puking and I desperately needed relief. 



This went on for months. Regime after regime nothing helped until finally I found a combination of meds and allergy pill that stopped the puking. 



I only recently realized how fucked up this was.  Several doctors insisted on protecting my NON EXISTENT fetus over my ability to work, drive and function. Truly frustrating.

I have two bosses and am very concerned about the expectations of the junior one,"I have two bosses - senior exec and junior. It’s supposed to be an 80%/20% split but is shaping up to be the opposite. 

This kid is absolutely relentless and his arrogance is out of control.

He sends 30 “coffee date” requests a day and if I don’t jump in within an hour (reminder it’s my first week and I’ve been in onboardings for at least half of each day), he does it himself. Yesterday I came back from a training and reached out to someone without making sure he hadn’t first - at that point I hadn’t yet realized he was quite so nervous/controlling - and he instantly Slacked me “it’s very much not a good look for us both to reach out, please be more careful”.  I said I’d be happy to smooth things over in a friendly way (as if it’s the world’s biggest deal that we both responded) by telling them it was my second day and he goes “we don’t need to make excuses”.  

He also sends me long missives over Slack: “protocol for working together”, thoughts, expectations, etc. He’s 26 in case that wasn’t obvious and has never had an EA before. These manifestos require re-reading and thoughtfulness/ emotional labor in their response. It’s exhausting.

I’ve worked until 9pm every day since I started trying to keep on top all of junior’s flight, event, and meeting requests and his emotional Slacks.

I’m in my early 40s - I’ve been in the C-suite for a decade and left a CEO for this role, because I loved my interviews with the more senior exec.

The senior exec’s EA is still there and the handover is slow. He’s only going to get more and more demanding - tons of international travel, he sits on a ton of boards. 

Has anyone ever had a two boss situation where one is swallowing you whole? Especially the one you’re not supposed to be giving all your time to?

How can I get a handle on this kid and set some boundaries early? I realize I can lean into the other boss (“I’m working on something time sensitive for [senior exec], but will be sure to do this as soon as possible”), but the senior exec is rather hands-off and conflict avoidant, and junior is prone to complaining and demands immediacy. I feel like I may need to find some other ways to train junior and temper his expectations. 

I’ve always been a hard worker and still am, but I have a new health situation in my life and am not willing to stress about him to this degree when he’s not even my primary boss. Two bosses ago I worked for a guy like this -  young tech CEO. But the key difference was he was my only boss. (And he was a lovely person).

 I’m in a HCOL area and this role pays well, about what you’d expect. HOWEVER it pays OT. I should have seen that was a trap. I’ve never worked a high-level EA job with OT.

Anyone with a similar issue? I will take it to senior boss if it doesn’t improve but would like to see if I can handle his expectations and train him a bit myself first.
