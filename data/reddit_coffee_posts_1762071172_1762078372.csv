I (27F) have been close friends with my coworker “Georgina” (37F) for a couple of years. She’s straight, has a long-term boyfriend, and two young kids.

Im single. Actively do not like kids, and a open lesbian. 

She’s usually pretty private, but over time she’s opened up to me a lot about her life, her kids, and her relationship. Her children know me by name and she talks about me to them all the time. I’ve gone out with them a few times, like to cafés or hanging out, we played tennis together one time and most recently I went trick-or-treating with them. She'll send me videos of the kids saying my name and gives me updates about them. 

Here’s where it gets confusing. She told me she wouldn’t take her kids trick-or-treating unless I went. It was their first time, and she said she felt a little embarrassed because English isn’t her first language and she wasn’t sure what to say at the doors, even though she’s basically fluent. I’d already told her what to say, but she still wanted me there. Her boyfriend was at home with his own kids, but she chose to go with me instead.

The night was really sweet, but it also felt kind of intimate. At one point she asked her son, “Who do you want to go with, Mummy or Luce?” (me). Later she said she really enjoyed it and wants to do it again next year, and that I could come over to do her and the kids’ Halloween makeup next time.
I asked if the bf was coming next year and she just said ""Luuuce"" and rolled her eyes. 

At work, people always comment on how close we are. We take coffee breaks together, tease each other, have nicknames for each other, and there’s a lot of eye contact that people notice. She’s told me she doesn’t like her boyfriend, sometimes compares him to me, and even jokes that she’s my type. She’s also physically playful, like sneaking up behind me and pulling my hair, then pretending it wasn’t her. She says we're ""Besties"" and that everyone knows we are besties. But she said ""Were not that kind of besties""

One time she even joked that if she died, her kids would have me, not her boyfriend. It was said in a light way, but it stuck with me.

At some point, I realized I’ve developed a big crush on her. I really care about her and her kids, but the closeness has started to feel confusing. I also feel kind of out of place, like I’ve become an extra parent or something. I don’t want to intrude on her relationship or overstep with her boyfriend, but I’m not sure where the line actually is anymore. I don’t know if I’m just misreading things because of my feelings, or if there’s actually something mutual happening.

When I try to pull back a little, like saying “we’ll see” when she brings up doing family stuff next year she brushes it off and keeps pressing. I feel like I need to step back from the family-type stuff, but I don’t know how to do that without hurting her feelings or making work awkward.

TLDR:
My (27F) straight friend and coworker (37F) with a boyfriend and kids keeps blurring the line between friendship and something more. I’ve developed a crush on her, but I don’t want to intrude on her relationship or overstep. I can’t tell if I’m just reading too much into things or if there’s something romantic going on. How do I step back without making things weird at work or damaging the friendship?",1,1762078210.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Create meals, drinks and snacks around those items.  Look through some of those old cookbooks collecting dust or look for some recipes online. Diced tomatoes can turn into salsa and rice can become rice pudding.  Probably also enough coffee, tea and cocoa packets to last through the rest of 2025.  Although we do not drink alcohol I am sure for some there are a few half bottles that can be combined.

Health and Beauty:  Again look through your shelves, cabinets and even your purses and luggage where 3 tweezers and 4 nail clippers are hiding.  Use up those travel sized shampoos and create a spa day using some of those clay masks and nail polishes you forgot about.

Medicines:  Clean out the medicine cabinet, drawers, car, purse and travel bag and inventory what you already have, realizing you have 5 half bottles of ibuprofen and 5 never used lip balms.

Office and school supplies:  Look through junk drawers, school bags, your closet, your kids closet, office bags, the car and any desks at home.  Those 10 composition books with 1-2 pages used can turn into to do lists, letter writing or journaling.  If you are lucky you may find a long lost gift card, greeting cards and book of stamps.

Clothing:  Look through your drawers, closet, bags, luggage and even the car.  There are probably clothes with the tags on them.

Sports equipment:  Look through every closet, sports bag, storage area and of course the car.  You will most likely find 5 air pumps, never worn cleats, tshirts for every tournament and baseball pants still in the plastic bag.

Please share your suggestions or experiences as well.  All the examples given are true including the composition books.

(I think my family is not normal pt2),"Maybe I'll start by addressing the question I got on my last post. I'm not sure what animal it is in the broth, but the vertebra are rather big, compared to geese or chicken. They are the size of half of my hand and quite robust, but can't be bovine or sheep because those are bigger.

  
Now onto why this update is late, yesterday was a mess and I can't stay at my parents house since it's considered a potential crime scene, so I'm with my grandma. She baked me my favourite cake and said I don't have to go to school this week, which is very nice.

  
I'm not going to use real names, because everyone says not to do that online and also there's police involved right now so I'd rather not make it more of a mess than it already is. I will call my best friend Lucas and rest will be numbers because I don't like them at all and they don't deserve real names anyway.  
  
We met around five PM at my place so Lucas and the other three could leave their things in my room and we could change into some costumes to go trick-or-treating. I hated the idea of my dad keeping the eye on us and everyone booed that, but there wasn't much we could do about it. At least he agreed to not walk with as long as he could see us from the front lawn. Lucas and I had really cool costumes of Rick and Morty. We got a lot of sweets in general and it was fun to go with friends and not just my parents as usual. Then we got home and divided the loot, before sitting around the TV to decide what horror film we should watch. My mum is good with baking and all so she brought us homemade cookies that looked like real fingers, and eye jellies laying in strawberry juce as well as some store bought snacks.  
  
First problem that we encountered was when my mum brought something less sweet to the table. Everyone freaked out when she set a plate of fried tongues on the coffee table. Explaining that they weren't human didn't help and one of them went home. Only Lucas and One tried the tongues after I explained that they were from cows and sheep. (Are really most people so unaware that they don't see the difference between human and bovine and lamb tongues? They are not **that** similar, I swear.)  
  
""Hey do you have anything else that is creepy in your home?"" Asked Two when we were looking for another movie to watch.  
  
""I find attic creepy."" I shrugged, before Lucas kicked my ankle. ""And I guess the drying room is creepy too.""  
  
""What is drying room?"" One chimed in, interested by the name.  
  
""I can just show you.""

And with that we left the living room and walked to the basement stairs. I decided to take a torch and not turn on main lights as well lighting the place would ruin the whole vibe. I always found it weird that basement was always dry and even the original wooden flooring haven't rotten yet, it creaked with each step as we crossed the short hallway that divided the lower level into a few smaller rooms. Everyone crowded behind me, as if I could shield them from whatever monsters we could encounter. 

I took a deep breath, before slowly pushing the door open, making everyone scream at the sight of a dead cow head that hanged from the broken neck hook that the whole carcass hanged on exiting a few inches behind it's ear. I did't particularly care about the milky eyes that were staring at us, panning the ring of light through the room, confused why the animal wasn't skinned as they always were. My confusion only heightened when something scurried through the room, it was big and sickly pale.

I shut the door with a scream and all four of us run up the stairs calling out for my parents. Long story short we got no explanation from them, Lucas and the other two left with their parents and just around dawn police showed up. There was a lot of ""adult talk"" that I wasn't able to listen in on and then I was forced to pack my things and move to grandma for a few days.

  
I'm pissed because there was no reason to call police, it was just some creature. My mum knows how to deal with things like that. I mean there is a reason why whole drying room has salt trail next to the walls. I asked Lucas if he wanted to go check out that place with a proper lighting and during the day when my parent's aren't home. My grandma has an old book about real monsters and I really want to know what that thing in the basement was and if it still is there. I just need to get a better look so I can find it in that book.

Most apps out there are either WAY too complex or too simple - thus requiring 5 different apps.  So I built a little app to try to make it better for coffee enthusiasts.

Allows for auto-adjustment of ratios depending on serving sizes.  Various unit types.  Brew timers.  Has demo data in settings if you just want to load and play around with it.  Also features common mistakes or recommended recipe adjustments based on your results.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Detroit Lions vs. Minnesota Vikings: A Tale of Two Defenses (and Why the Lions Should Win)**

**Parsing the Odds: The Math Doesn’t Lie (Mostly)**  
The Detroit Lions are favored by **8.5 to 9 points** across bookmakers, with decimal odds of **1.2 to 1.22** (implied probability: **83-85%**) for a straight-up win. The Minnesota Vikings, meanwhile, are priced at **4.5 to 4.75** (implied probability: **21-23%**), which is about as optimistic as betting on a snowstorm in July in Arizona. The total is set at **47.5-48.5 points**, suggesting a high-scoring game, but given the Lions’ D allows just **300 yards per game** and the Vikings’ offense ranks **24th in passing**, I’ll take “meh” over “explosion.”

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Trade Debts, and QB Comebacks**  
The Lions are coming off a **bye week** and are **“relatively healthy”** (a phrase that in NFL speak means “we’re not lying on the field twitching”). The Vikings? They’ve been playing football like a broken game of Jenga. Their defense, which allowed **200+ rushing yards** to the Chargers last week, is a sieve held together by duct tape and hope. They traded their **nose tackle** (Harrison Phillips) for pass-rush specialists, then lost **Blake Cashman** and **Andrew Van Ginkel** (back but questionable) to injuries. It’s like trading your umbrella in a hurricane for a life preserver and a coupon for hot coffee.

On offense, the Vikings are led by **J.J. McCarthy**, fresh off a five-game absence with a high ankle sprain. McCarthy, a former Michigan legend, now faces his alma mater’s alumni in Detroit. Meanwhile, the Lions’ offensive line, though missing Pro Bowl center Frank Ragnow, has **second-year player Christian Mahogany** declaring, “We canceled the noise.” If “the noise” is the Vikings’ defense, congrats—y’all just canceled a toddler’s tantrum.

Thought I’d show the process of uncovering the original stairs.  

The foyer had been divided into two separate entrances for the first and second floor units.  I took those “curtain walls” out.  The drywall was dated to 1949-ish by a Reddit sleuth (thank you again).  

With the walls gone, the changes to the original second floor stairs could be reversed.  The original stairs were still under there, minus only the treads.

I think there is now enough room in the foyer for a small coffee bar, pastry display, cash register etc.  

For some reason, the foyer has been entirely sheetrocked - like, drywall placed over the original lath and plaster walls.  I have no idea why, but I’m removing that drywall too. The extra 1” of space isn’t important, but it just bugs me to have that unneccesary drywall there.  At least, I hope it is unnecessary . . .

The stairs from first floor to side door had been covered with a large wood “box” and the door covered over.  I took that stuff off, and the original stairs were still there, ditto the original door.  

The basement will be book storage and office for the cafe-bookstore, so it’ll handy to have easier access than going outside and around as we had to do before!

I’ve taken a collagen supplement for about a year, I don’t like meat so I wanted to up my protein. After the bone scan I decided to pay the extra for Algeacal collagen because of the claims that it has increased bone density, and I’m hoping it pays off. 
I have two questions, one, is there a limit to how much collagen you should take? Like could I use Algeacal in the morning and do my other collagen at night? 
Two, I’m particular about my cup of tea & can taste the collagen. So I’ve been making coffee to mix it with in the morning, but the caffeine caused problems. Any advice on how to take collagen so that you can’t taste it and that you enjoy drinking? I’ve found it hard to get it to dissolve in cold beverages. 
Finally, any testimony that this isn’t a waste of money would be appreciated. I’m skeptical of Algeacal’s claims, though backed up by studies, the extra advertising (I’ve seen everything: smoothes wrinkles and skin tags, better hair, reduced cellulite) seems way too good to be true, so how do I know any of what they claim is really true?

I've had my DF54 for about 3 months now and I'm generally very happy. Espressos are extremely enjoyable, bright and complex compared to my previous 1zpresso JX, no clogging issues for me luckily (I always do 2-3 spritzes rdt regardless) and I did have some nice cups with my aeropress.

I am now struggling with V60 though (which is my favorite morning style). I have two different coffees that were sold to me as ""filter roast"" and described as fruity and bright etc. 
I cannot get any decent acidity out of them.
In espresso, sure, I even have to go all the way down to 11-12 otherwise they're even too sour for my taste. 
But with the V60 I've tried all the grind settings from 45 to 70 and I still feel mostly bitterness and varying degrees of astringency but I cannot find the pleasant aromatics and fruity notes that I was expecting.

The thing that makes me suspect the grinder is that my drawdown time is always, always high regardless of the grind setting. It even increases at coarser settings!
today I took the grind from 53 to 70 and the drawdown went from 4:52 to 5:05. 
with the other beans (from same roaster) it's the same. 4 mins at 54; 4:06 at 65.
(my zero is at about -3)

I'm thinking that perhaps I'm getting too many fine particles that are clogging my filter?
Does anyone have the same issue?
Is my unit defective/misaligned?
Is it the beans?

Well, my story is as follows. I met my girlfriend on Tinder, and she was married in an open relationship. Since I only wanted to meet girls, I didn't care. But I fell madly in love with her and ignored all my doubts. But one day I told her I needed to leave, that I'm monogamous and I'm not happy sharing her with someone else. She said she was going to separate from her ex because the relationship wasn't working anymore. So I decided to wait. But a year passed with them still living together, even though they had already broken up. However, her ex demanded that she not go out with me in public so that people wouldn't think she was being cheated on (even though everyone already thought she was). My girlfriend obeyed, and to this day it hurts me. I spent a year hiding, and this ex continued to pursue me because she didn't want to give up on me. And because she was my first girlfriend, I ignored all of that to be with her. After more than a year since she left her ex's house (we had already been together for two years), it occurred to me to look at her phone. I found messages where she said that if nothing worked out with her new partner, they had an agreement to get back together, and several other messages saying things about me, like that I'm not as fun at parties as her ex, even though she herself said she hated parties. I know I'm a unique person, but she always said she loved me for who I am. And other messages where her ex insulted me, and she didn't even defend me. The worst part was seeing her flirting with a girl she was already dating. She kept saying that girl was an idiot and, at least two weeks before I found out, she insisted on accepting an invitation to go out for coffee with that girl. Already suspicious, I found the messages. An important detail is that the girl didn't even reciprocate the flirting, while at the same time seeming to be humiliating herself for a vagina. Another important detail is that these messages were already a year old, which means that if she could, I would never have found out (and this proves that I'm not crazy enough to be checking her phone). The only thing she said to me when I confronted her with the truth was: you could just let it go. And that still resonates with me today (even after 3 years together). And every time I brought up the subject again, asking why she did it, the answer was always the same: I don't know/I was crazy/it wasn't intentional. And that drives me crazy, because I'd rather she tell me she's horny or that I'm not good enough and that she needs more girls, because that way I wouldn't feel like trash and that it was all my fault. She broke up with me recently, saying that we couldn't live together anymore because we couldn't pay the bills, and me????? What bills? I pay my rent (she lived with me), my food, internet, etc. I never depended on her because I always managed on my own, so she asked if we could continue dating but living in separate houses, and I said I would never accept that because when I most wanted to live with her, she said no, because she had just gotten out of a marriage, and I understood, even though I was hurt. However, months later she moved into my house, and after a month I asked what was going on, what we were now, and she told me: ""Friends, I'm just spending more time here."" I tried this conversation at least 3 times until she told me that it always worked like that with her, suddenly dating, suddenly living together (and wow, she's my first girlfriend and knew how important formal requests are to me). Continuing, I didn't accept living in separate houses after she invaded my space and, after almost a year in my house, decided to leave, just as she decided to live with me WITHOUT TALKING TO ME FIRST. Then she wanted to backtrack and out of nowhere told me she had bought an apartment and kept it a secret for two years, and I was in shock, so shocked that I'm still processing it (this was a month ago). She said the apartment was for us and that she wanted to do things differently now and asked me to be her girlfriend (yes, she never asked me to be her girlfriend before) with a hair bow referencing a sapphic couple we love (and I accepted, okay). In therapy I talked about it and, listening to myself, I asked: ""Damn it, you son of a bitch, do you hate yourself? Why the hell are you accepting this?"" I swear, I'm even ashamed to say this. But even knowing how I feel, maybe I want her validation that I'm not crazy for wanting to leave. Anyway, it seems that now she's afraid of losing me and keeps saying that I'm not the same as before, and my answer is always: ""Oh, and you liked it, didn't you? So why were you cheating on me while I was like this in the past?"" And for her, telling the truth like that is a great offense. Well, it seems like it will take a long time if I continue telling the story.

Hi,
I’ve been struggling with gastroduodenitis (with mild ulceration) for about 3 years. I finally got a clear diagnosis after a recent gastroscopy and started a PPI a week ago, which I’m supposed to stay on for 6 months.

My main symptoms are mild burning, nausea, and bloating that come and go — mainly in the upper abdomen, though sometimes the discomfort spreads a bit lower. I’ve cut out coffee, spicy foods, alcohol, and acidic foods. I mostly eat softer meals and drink chamomile tea. I still smoke cigarettes sometimes and drink yerba mate tea, which I’m worried might be slowing my healing.

My questions:

	1.	Should I completely stop cigarettes and mate tea during this treatment period?

	2.	Is kefir safe to drink with mild ulceration, or could it worsen irritation?

	3.	How long does it usually take to notice improvement after starting a PPI?",1,1762076940.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1omd7zb,https://www.reddit.com/r/medschoolph/comments/1omd7zb/maybe_i_wasnt_meant_for_j_a_clerkship_delulu_story/,Maybe I Wasn’t Meant for J- A clerkship delulu story,"Today, I decided to unravel this not-so-extraordinary love story.
 Though, if I’m being honest… it was extraordinary to me.
Because somewhere between sleepless duties, caffeine-fueled rounds, and doing CF4 (haha), I found something that felt like love — even if it wasn’t meant to last.
 Or maybe… it was just training for the real thing.

Anyway, this is my clerkship love story.

It all started during one of my major rotations. I was mentally checked out, emotionally flatlined, and running purely on caffeine and adrenaline.
 I swore to myself: “No distractions this time. Just survive.”

Then came James.

My senior. Confident. Calm. And infuriatingly good-looking in scrubs (delulu na this).
 You know that type who always looks like he just stepped out of a medical drama? Yeah. Him.
And the worst part?
 He wasn’t even my type.
 But the universe, as usual, said: “Plot twist!”

The moment he introduced himself, I swear time slowed down like a scene in Hospital Playlist. His voice was ugggghhh, slightly teasing — and when he smiled, I forgot how to breathe (which, for a future doctor, is concerning).

Our first interaction was purely professional… but the tension? Unmistakable.
 He’d correct me in humble way, lend me his pen, and once — when I forgot mine — he leaned close and said,
“You can borrow mine, but I’ll need it back… maybe over dinner (Chos ahaha the dinner thing did not happen)?”
I laughed, pretending to be calm, but inside? My heart was doing Zumba.
Soon he got too comfortable.
 
Our action intrigued the department since we'd got too close all of the sudden  in front of everyone, even let me use his phone — with password access!
 I mean, who does that if it’s “nothing”?
But here’s the plot twist:
 He was sweet when it was just us, but the moment his friends teased him—
“Oi James, may something kayo ni Lex (let me hide my identity please lang hahaha) ah!”
 He’d laugh and say,
 “What? No way! We’re not a thing, guys!”
It was a joke.
 But my heart didn’t find it funny.
Still, I stayed. Because… baka he’s just shy, right?
Wrong.

 Rotation ended — and so did whatever “us” was.
 The messages stopped. The sweetness faded. And just like that, I was ghosted faster than a stat call.

Then came Joseph.
 My classmate — smart, serious, and always looked like he was in a relationship with his notes.
He wasn’t my type either (apparently, I like men who ruin my peace).
 But somehow, proximity worked its quiet magic.

And then came our “date.”
 It wasn’t fancy — just dinner after a long day — but it felt different.
 Later, I found out he used his hard-earned allowance to pay for everything.
 My heart… melted like an overused ice pack.
When we stepped out of the restaurant, there was this pause — the night breeze brushing past, the world feeling oddly still. (Char hahaha)
 I looked at him. He looked at me.
 And for a second, I almost kissed him.
But of course, I chickened out.
 So I laughed it off, pretending it was nothing.

And now?
 Yeah, I regret it.
Funny how sometimes the heartbreaks that hurt the most are the ones that never even happened.

Just when I thought my heart had retired… life said: “Round 2.”
Enter Bryan.
 
A Doctor from Manila — someone I met during clerkship (yan yung sabi niya because I can't barely remember him haha). One of those people who could make time stop with just a smile.
He had this habit of showing up exactly when I needed him.
 Like a walking, talking serotonin shot.

He’d message,
“Hey, I’m near your hospital. Coffee?”
 And I’d say no (kunwari busy), but somehow he’d still be there, waiting outside.

Then one night — oh, this one was straight out of a BL sitcom.
He came to pick me up in front of my co-PGIs.
 Panic mode: ON.
 So, of course, I grabbed his wrist and dragged him away like a drama queen escaping paparazzi. (Sorry pa-main character syndrome yarrn haha)
But just as I thought I’d saved my dignity…
 I slipped.
He caught me.
 Literally.
And instead of helping me up right away, he laughed.
 Hard.
It was ridiculous, awkward, and absolutely perfect.

From then on, he became my calm.
 He didn’t send mixed signals.
 He didn’t make me guess.
 He just showed up — steady, patient, warm.

Turns out, I wasn’t just unlucky in love — I was just waiting for the right initial to rewrite my ending. (Malas tayo sa J, sa ibang initial naman haha)

Because B didn’t make me question my worth.
 He just reminded me that love doesn’t have to be confusing — it can be simple, steady, and even a little bit clumsy.
So yeah… maybe I wasn’t meant for J.
 But I’m grateful for both of them — because they led me to Bryan.
The one who caught me… even when I slipped.

Sometimes, love isn’t about grand gestures or perfect timing.
 It’s about the one who stays — the one who shows up without being asked, the one who catches you when life makes you fall (literally or emotionally).

Because in the end, love doesn’t always arrive with fireworks.
 Sometimes, it comes laughing — helping you up, dusting you off, and saying,
“Hey, I got you.” 
----
Already a licensed doctor now, by the way. 💙
To all current clerks and PGIs — may this remind you that even in the chaos of hospital life, unexpected moments of warmth and connection can still find you.

Just… maybe not my kind of story, okay? 😂",2,1762076569.0,medschoolph,0,0.75,False

Generative AI is just high-tech brainwashing. It’s the next level of propaganda indoctrination. It is there to turn our brains into useless sludge which cannot function without technological crutches controlled by the imperial plutocrats.

They want us to abandon our humanity for technology.

They don’t want us making our own art.

They don’t want us making our own music.

They don’t want us writing our own poetry.

They don’t want us contemplating philosophy for ourselves.

They don’t want us turning inwards and getting in touch with an authentic spirituality.

They want to replace the dynamic human spirit with predictable lines of code.

Our brains are conditioned to select for cognitive ease, and that’s what the AI merchants are selling us. The sales pitch is, “You don’t have to exert all that mental effort thinking new thoughts, learning new things, and expressing yourself creatively! This product will do it for you!”

But it comes at a cost. We have to trade in our ability to do those things for ourselves.

Historically when a new technology has shown up, that kind of tradeoff has been worth it. Not many people know how to start a fire with a bow drill anymore, but it rarely matters because modern technology has given us much more efficient ways of starting fires and keeping warm. It didn’t make sense to spend all the time and effort necessary to maintain our respective bow drill skills once that technology showed up.

But this isn’t like that. We’re not talking about some obsolete skill we won’t need anymore thanks to modern technological development, we’re talking about our minds. Our creative expression. Our inspiration. Our very humanness.

Even if AI worked well (it doesn’t) and even if our plutocratic overlords could be trusted to interpret reality on our behalf (they can’t), those still wouldn’t be aspects of ourselves that we should want to relinquish.

In this oligarchic dystopia, it is an act of defiance just to insist upon maintaining your own cognitive faculties. Regularly exercising your own creativity, ingenuity and mental effort is a small but meaningful rebellion.

So exercise it.

Don’t ask an AI to think something through for you. Work it out as best you can on your own. Even if the results are flawed, it’s still better than losing your ability to reason.

Don’t ask AI to create art or poetry for you. Make it yourself. Even if it’s crap, it’ll still be better than outsourcing your artistic capacity to a machine.

Don’t even run to a chatbot every time you need to find information about something. See if you can work your way through the old enshittified online search methods and find it for yourself. Our rulers are getting better and better at hiding inconvenient facts from us, so we’ve got to get better and better at finding them.

Get in touch with the fleshy, tactile experience of human embodiment, because they are trying to get you to abandon it.

Really feel your feet on the ground. The air in your lungs. The wind in your hair. Teach yourself to calm your restless mind and take in the beauty that’s all around you in every moment.

Repair the attention span that’s been shattered by smartphones and social media. Learn to meditate and focus on one thing for an extended period. Don’t look at your phone so much.

Read a book. A paper one, that you can touch and smell and hear the pages rustle as you turn them. If it’s an old one from the library or the used book store, that’s even better.

It doesn’t have to be a challenging book if your attention span is really shot. Start simple. A kids book. A comic book. Whatever you can manage. You’re putting yourself through cognitive restorative therapy. Your first steps don’t have to impress anybody.

Get in touch with your feelings. The ones you’ve been suppressing for years. Let them come out and have their say, listening to them like a loving parent to a trembling child.

Learn to cherish those moments in between all the highlights of your day. The time you spend at red lights, or waiting for the coffee to brew. There is staggering beauty packed into every moment on this earth; all you need to do is learn to notice it.

Embrace your humanity. Embrace your feelings. Embrace your flaws. Embrace your inefficiency. Embrace everything they’re trying to get you to turn away from.

What they are offering you is so very, very inferior to the immense treasure trove that you are swimming in just by existing as a human being on this planet.

You are a miracle. This life is a miracle.

Don’t let them hide this from you.",3,1762076345.0,WayOfTheBern,1,1.0,False

Weekends slip by faster than they should. So how about we hit pause on doomscrolling, step out of our comfort zones (and pajamas), and do something refreshingly different?

Maybe we start with a visit to a museum or art gallery—where we pretend to “get” abstract art while secretly rating the frame choices and color palettes like undercover critics. From there, we wander into one of Bangalore’s greener corners or stumble through a colorful market, just soaking in the chaos or calm, depending on the mood. When our feet (or attention spans) give out, we settle into a cozy café for coffee, or maybe cool off with ice cream that feels way too indulgent for the weather. 

And if the conversation’s still flowing, who knows—maybe a spontaneous detour to a bookshop rounds off the day just right.

26, tech guy, semi-professional overthinker, full-time curious soul. I like swimming, spontaneous treks, and exploring cafés that look like they were built for rainy days and long chats. On weekends, I alternate between doing absolutely nothing and everything at once.

My partners ex has psychosis and bpd.  They have twins who are 2 years old.

We have been together 10 months now and we'll my partner wants to include me in his children's life but I can't do this til I've had a coffee and a chat with the children mother.

Firstly I don't need to sit down with this women who is she the bloody mafia. I'm not the one with issues. I find it insulting that I've been summoned before I can see my partners children.

Secondly she Is a psyco from what I heard from people. A proper psyco not one of these pretenders. She is all calm and smiles but you hurt someone she cares about and she's a whole different person completely. There are story's of her and her father fighting when she was 10 years old she was placed into foster care away from her family but still who fights their daughter and what child fights back like these rumors say she gave it as much as he did and he pulled a weapon on her and she didn't flinch.

I've spoken to my partner on this and he said I'm blowing this up in my head. 
That she was a victim of abuse as a child not a psyco she went into fight or flight.
That she is the safest person for his children to be with she loves them unconditionally she would protect them from the world.

He said as soon as I meet her I would like her she's a lovely person. To which I asked if she's so lovely why did you leave her.

He ended up snapping at Me correcting me saying that she left him. 

I told him I don't ever want to meet this women and if needed I won't ever meet his children as I don't trust her I also said to him I don't really want him talking to her unless it's child related anymore as clearly there are feelings still.

He basically told me I'm overreacting to all of this and he wants me to seek help before he continues this relationship with me

About 1.5 years ago I started to experience ""skipped heart beats"". They would come either in episodes that would last for about 30-60 minutes, typically after eating a meal or drinking coffee, or sometimes when I am making torso/shoulder movements like during workouts or brushing my teeth - in this case those wouldn't be long episodes, just a reaction to the movement.  
During an episodes I can feel about 20-30 skips in an hour.

Not sure if it's related, but about 2 weeks before I started to feel the palpitations I had a very stressful situation, where my heart was punding hard and racing very fast. It was a one-off, I usually don't have this level of stress in life.

The cardiologist ruled out any structural or organical issues with the heart - all findings were within normal range, like ECG, Holter monitor (pic attached), ultrasound, blood test.

Since it was mostly associated with eating, doctor was confident that it was caused by GERD. As a results I've been to the gastroenterologist and he could only find the very minor GERD (grade M) and a slight sliding hiatal hernia.

I've been taking the GERD medicine for almost a year now, but the episodes still happen.

Is there any course of action that I could take to find a potential effective treatment/cause for my case, or should I just learn to live with this?

KGG no longer owns VS Code Red. She has nothing to do with him anymore. What she did do was build his entire legacy the show career, the promotion, the reason anyone even knows his name. She’s the one who made him the stallion he became, full stop.

What’s conveniently ignored is that VS Code Red spent most of his breeding life not even at KGG’s farm in Oklahoma. He stood at Gumz Farms in Kentucky (about 400-something miles away), then later at High Point and EE Ranches in Texas, which are around 200 miles from her. So yes, she saw him through the years, but probably not in the “weekly coffee and carrot cake” sense these clowns imagine.

Yet these rejects complain that KVS doesn't see him often which she doesn't. This is true of so many horses that are either in training or standing as studs. But it's only an issue when its KVS.

And now, compare that to Bo, a 25-year-old gelding who has lived his entire life at KVS’s farm. Yet somehow, these self-appointed equine psychologists claim Bo “doesn’t know her anymore” because she travels. 

So here’s the main point: stop trying to pit KGG and KVS against each other. KGG’s legacy with VS Code Red stands on its own, KVS now owns him and is doing the promoting for him and continuing his legacy. ",1,1762075346.0,KVSsnarkaboutsnarkers,0,1.0,False

Wild part? You can look totally normal and still have a lot of it.

Visceral fat’s the sneaky kind that hides under the muscle, not under the skin. It’s tied to insulin resistance, inflammation, and that weird tired-for-no-reason feeling that coffee never fixes.
I’ve met people with healthy BMIs but sky-high visceral fat on scans. Makes you question how much the mirror actually tells you.

And forget the ab workouts they don’t touch it.
What does help (and no one likes hearing this): cutting back on alcohol, sleeping like you mean it, eating fewer ultra-processed carbs, and lifting a few times a week. Nothing sexy, just the basics that actually work long-term.

On April this year I had a severe anaphylaxis episode due to hair bleacher. Funny thing is that I've bleached my hair since I was 15 and never had a problem before until now that I'm 32. I'm not really sure if I've developed an allergy to the bleacher at this point because I blame the brand that I used that time, it's not so good quality and the smell of the chemical was too strong but I'm kinda scared to figure it out by making a test with another brand and go again through all the hell I lived.

Anyways, six months have passed since then and I'm much better now but I wouldn't dare to say I'm 100% fully recovered. I feel like the anaphylaxis has left me with some lil sequelae. There are some everyday situations that seem rather strange now:

My sense of smell became very sensitive; there are smells that I perceive very strongly and that I cannot stand, not to the point of feeling super dizzy and fainting but still a very uncomfortable sensation. The smell of gasoline is one of them.

My heart literally feels a little “weak”. I don't know how to describe this because I'm very functional in my day-to-day life so I cannot tell if this is actually a sequel or if is just stress that I have from other personal situations. I try to relax and meditate and it helps at times but still cannot get rid of this “weak heart sensation”.

Sometimes I feel like my tongue is still a bit swollen.

Another thing is low blood pressure out of nowhere. I barely drink alcohol anymore but I had a few beers last week and the next day I was dying during the hangover. By a moment I felt like my blood pressure drop and felt extremely suffocated, like I was running out of air. It was a very desperate moment.

Talking about feeling suffocated, lately I’' been feeling too overwhelmed when I'm surrounded by crowds. I went to a Halloween party on Friday, the bar was packed and again I started to feel a lil dizzy, short of air and suffocated just because of that.

None of this used to happened to me before the anaphylaxis episode and I wonder if these strange sensations will ever go away. It's not like they happen all the time but they don't disappear completely and it drives me crazy, especially because it makes me think I won't be able to enjoy life as I used to anymore. I love traveling around the world, what if I feel suffocated during a flight? I also love going to concerts and being at the very front and makes me sad thinking I won't be able to do that anymore without having an attack, same thing with drinking alcohol, even coffee is giving me a hard time!

Hi everyone,

Coffee was once a street indie dog, extremely malnourished, old, and barely able to walk. Deciding to rescue him wasn’t easy — the responsibility felt huge — but I couldn’t leave him suffering alone. 💔

Coffee is too old to survive on the streets now. He’s suffering from osteoarthritis, pressure sores, and lumps on his body.
His FNAC test was done — and though it’s not confirmed yet, the lump could be cancerous if it grows further.
He’s now on medicines to delay the growth of cancerous cells and needs regular vet checkups and care.

This post includes Coffee’s latest vet visit, treatment details, and online medicine links — everything is transparent and verifiable.
	•	Vet bill: ₹2,000 (includes tablets worth ₹3,000 — same medicine available online) Condrovet and strong beat tablet.  It's 50-50.
	•	Boarding (October): ₹5,000 ( At the boarding, his eyes are cleaned twice a day, he gets infrared twice a day, and physiotherapy twice a day). 
Will keep updating everything regularly here ❤️‍🩹

You can scan the QR (Rajat Bhardwaj) to help.
Kindly share a screenshot after contributing — it helps me keep proper track. All the contributions will directly go towards coffee’s medicine, vet visit, and physio-infrared therapies 🙏

Just a young kid, trying to support an old indie dog like Coffee, letting him live his last moments with dignity, comfort, and love. ❤️‍🩹🐶

It’s urgent and important —  I don't need a single penny, that's why attaching all the details of coffee’s caretakers. So you all kind people can contribute directly. Hats off to them. I have just rescued coffee and am paying his expenses. Now I really need your help from all of you people. Also, keeping track of his regular updates, I visit coffee and caretakers to meet every weekend. That's it! 

Being a student really it's really mentally challenging for me to do everything alone. I can't keep him at my home. As there is no one to really take care of him. My mom is ortho patient. Plus she is doing a lot for our near by street furries ❤️
By freelancing, I do take care of my street and university dogs from feeding to sterilization. But found coffee via other people. And the expense is min to max is 10k for coffee individually. People who used to look after coffee, have all given up now. But for me, every dog is equal and deserves the best life. With the hope, posting here. 
As long as coffee lives, forever gonna take care of him. Stay tuned for regular updates ❤️‍🩹🐾

All contributions go directly to Coffee’s care and love.
Thank you for reading, sharing, and being kind. 🐾✨

1omcm8c,https://i.redd.it/q3hj5ez47tyf1.png,Inflation vs Salary: 4 Budget Fixes Every Young Professional in PH Should Make Now,"Inflation keeps rising — but salaries? Not so much.  
And if your budget hasn’t changed in the past few years, that gap is quietly shrinking your savings and increasing your stress.

Here are four simple but crucial budget updates every young professional in the Philippines should consider in 2025:

---

### 1. Recheck your “fixed” expenses — they’re not really fixed anymore.
Rent, groceries, and transport quietly climb each year.  
What used to be ₱3,500 for groceries might now cost ₱4,200.  
If your “fixed” list hasn’t been reviewed since 2023, you’re likely underestimating your real expenses.

** Tip:** Review your recurring bills every quarter. Adjust anything that went up by 10% or more.

---

### 2. Give your savings goal a cost-of-living raise.
Inflation doesn’t just increase spending — it shrinks your savings power.  
If you’ve been saving ₱2,000 a month since 2022, that money now buys less.  
Add even ₱200–₱300 to keep pace with inflation.

** Try this:** Set an automatic savings bump using Maya, MariBank, or Tonik’s recurring transfer features.

---

### 3. Manage lifestyle creep without killing your joy.
Price increases often sneak in through small comforts — ₱180 coffee, more frequent take-outs, extra subscriptions.  
You don’t have to give them all up; just scale back consciously.  
Replace daily habits with weekly treats or cheaper swaps.

**Mindset shift:** Cut *unconscious spending*, not happiness.

---

### 4. Update your emergency fund to match real costs.
If rent or utilities went up, your emergency fund target should too.  
An outdated buffer defeats its purpose when you actually need it.

**Formula:**  
> Updated monthly expenses × 3–6 months = realistic emergency fund goal

Recalculate this at least once a year — inflation-proofing isn’t just for investments, it’s for safety nets too.

---

**TL;DR:**  
Prices move. Salaries lag.  
A static budget quietly erodes your financial stability.  
Keep adjusting — not because life got harder, but because you’re getting *smarter* about how it changes.

---

**Question for discussion:**  
Which part of your budget took the biggest hit this year — groceries, rent, or transport?

I’ve always thought of myself as pretty health-conscious — green smoothies, daily walks, the whole Pinterest-perfect routine. But after baby number two, my *energy* felt permanently parked at “low battery.” 😴  

Then I found the **Fit To Be Pregnant Plan**, promising sustainable energy, balance, and yes—less mom-guilt. Skeptical? Me too.  
Fast forward 30 days, and my energy levels didn’t just improve; they *tripled.* No exaggeration. Let me break it down 👇  

---

### 💪 What Changed (and Why I’ll Never Go Back):  

• **Mindful Fitness > Rigid Workouts:** Instead of pushing through intense routines, this program reshaped how I approached movement.  
• **Nutrition That Makes Sense:** They focus on whole-food balance — real ingredients, no extremes.  
• **Community & Accountability:** The digital support circle was honestly half the motivation.  
• **Tiny Habits, Big Returns:** It didn’t demand massive life overhauls — just steady, realistic changes that grew more powerful over time.  

---

### 🌿 Tangible Benefits I Noticed:  

- **Midday crashes? Gone.** I’m not guzzling iced coffee to survive anymore.  
- **Mood stability.** My mind feels sharper and calmer.  
- **Better sleep quality.** I wake up rested, not groggy.  
- **Real, visible strength.** My body feels *capable*, not just “in recovery.”  

I’ve tested plenty of wellness plans that promise miracles.  
This one? It didn’t feel like a miracle.  
It felt like alignment — doing what my body actually needed.

Im just going about my day and everything is normal albeit sometimes a bit muted or a bit low sometimes, and all of a sudden I see a Dutch Bros. and boom. Instant pain, like the fucking building grabbed my heart and squeezes hard and doesn't let go. And crumples my throat so it hurts and I can't swallow. And all I can do is stare and think about the time with her. And if I do manage to look away thats all that consumes me until I'm able to forget somehow. And the worst part is she doesn't even know I still think about her. She doesnt even know how much pain Im in everytime I pass a fucking dutch shitty bros shitty coffee.

Yes 3 years and I still fucking cant help it every time I pass by a dutch bros, or see a girl that looks like her, that has her big doe eyes and sad tired eye bags and big cute smile or whenever a girl has that slightly sad slightly stressed out look, when theyre talking but you know something is on their mind. And I iust desperately want her and want to comfort her the way I never did then and want to make up for everything I didn't do.

Before, marami na kaming intimate moments but we never did penetration dahil nga takot and ayaw namin magkaanak, both din kami in college kaya it's a no for us. Dahil nga rin ayaw namin, di ako bumibili ng protection kasi ayaw ko rin talaga pa magkaroon ng penetration, baka kasi pag mayroon akong nakaready, maassure kami na gawin na lang dahil meron pritection pero ayaw ko pa talaga (sana naintindihan nyo). But one day, we did it without having the protection (we were just doing intimate things but didn't expect lang na madadala sa ganun), i know it was my fault for not having protection ready. Di ko rin nacontrol sarili ko and dahil nga rin a day before ovulation ng GF ko according to flo, maybe she was too affected by hormones to stop, it was entirely my fault. We just did it for a bit but i pulled out immediately once i felt the pleasure before even ejaculating, at first sure akong wala kasi i didn't feel the ejaculation baka dahil din kinakabhan and wala akong nakita, but days after i had doubts. 

10/05/25
First day of her last period

10/17/25 
The day we did it

10/18/25
The start of her ovulation according to flo

Around 10/26/25
She started having itchy breast (i thought it was just because of hormones) and also having blood clots with her stool

10/31/25
Night time, feel nya raw malansa yung amoy ng coffee, feel nya rin sumasakit sikmura nya everytime na naaamoy na yung coffee


We we're hoping na it  dahil lang sa hormones and acid reflux pero ilang days na rin akong di mapakali dahil nga ayaw namin and i know na mas mahirap for her kahit na di nya masyado sinasabi sakin na nagwoworry sya. We talked about it before na if ever may gantong mangyari, we are going to have an abortion but i don't know if she will really do it dahil it's her body and emotions but i think gagawin naman namin since ayaw namin magkaanak rin in the future. 

Her next period is supposed to be on Nov 6 but if wala pa syang period by nov 6, we are planning to do a PT test agad para madetect agad if ever meron para makakuha agad ako from WHW, WoW, or safe2choose dahil nga it takes a long time to arrive.  I am also planning to make her do PT tests everyday in case lang na it is too early to detect anything pa para nga di kami dumating sa point na di na magiging effective ang MA, will it be too straining on her mental health if ganun ang ipagawa ko sa kanya? i need your help po so we can get through it.

Sorry rin to my gf but i didn't ask for her consent of me posting about this dahil ayoko rin mafeel nya nagpapanic na ako nang sobra baka kasi mas lalo lang sya mastress. Thank u po sa magbibigay ng opinions and help.

I can tell she likes me too. She recently abruptly mentioned she has CF. I took it as a sign she wanted me to know it before I do anything.

I've been reading a lot about it. I know it's very, very hard. Breathing treatments, meds... poor energy. Some of it don't bother me. I don't like leaving the house and am pretty low energy myself and my perfect match would be one that is not seeking many activities. I don't need any more kids so that part is ok too.

There are some aspects though I need to know more about. A lot of it is very personal so if you choose to share know that I appreciate it a lot.

I want to know what I'd be commiting to. I don't want to hurt anyone.

How does intimacy work? What are the compromises you have to make? Are there certain things you can't do? Or not do as often as you'd like? I read some studies where almost 95% participants reported problems with sex, lack of lubrication or just straight up constant pain and discomfort, suggesting normal sex life is impossible? Idk if maybe I misread it... I didn't see many complaints here on Reddit but I understand its probably hard to talk about, even on the internet.

Can you go to restaurants? Eat any food anytime as long as you have your enzymes? Can we order pizza? Spontaneously stop by some coffee shop and get donuts? Stuff like that? Do you get upset stomach often? Is it preventable or something that can happen anytime out of nowhere even if you take the meds?

Can you go on a road trip? Vacation? Can you fly on the planes? I'd assume you have to bring along the nebulizer machine, the therapy vest... but other than that, is it something that you can do or is it too exhausting?

Can you swim in a warm pool? Jacuzzi tub? Ocean?

Is there any common activities you cant do because of an infection concern?

Is there anything else that is maybe making you extra self-conscious? At least in the early stages of relationship?

When you're sick, is it always hospital time or do you stay at home? When at home, what additional or special care do you need? Are you able to get out of bed? 

Is there anything else? It's a lot to ask and digest but there's somebody's life I'm considering changing and I want to make sure I'm fit for it.

1omc50d,https://www.reddit.com/r/walkingwarrobots/comments/1omc50d/the_ultimate_ao_ming_is_back_with_lightning_and/,"The Ultimate Ao Ming Is Back, With Lightning and Chaos","Some of you might’ve caught **Aygir’s latest video**, an Ultimate Ao Ming rocking Dessa Oraye and four Cataclysms.  
I actually ran into him in a match and thought: *“What the heck are those electric death-beams?”*

Turns out, I hadn’t seen a Cataclysm in action for ages, and wow, it’s still a sight to behold.  
But the real question is: does it actually work?

**The Setup**

Aygir used a Titan-charging Teth to turbo-spawn his Ao Ming early.  
(Yes, that means Tesla Teth, sacrificing your Teth to supercharge your Titan.)

He dropped the Ming at the 9-minute mark, fully charged, and instantly turned the map into a thunderstorm. The early-Titan strategy alone is solid, nothing like an Ultimate titan hitting the field before your opponent even finishes their morning coffee.

Then there’s the Dessa Oraye pilot, giving the Cataclysms up to +16% damage, extra gray damage, and that familiar slowdown effect like UE Flames. Downside? You lose the stealth from Liu.

On top of that, he ran TNA, stacking damage up to an additional massive +142% when charged.

So, how’s the DPS?

* With TRA: about 160 k/s
* With TNA: around 199 k/s

Not mind-blowing, but remember, it’s full defense mitigation and loads of gray damage.

**My take**

I ran 20 matches with each setup, TNA and TRA.  
And honestly? Dropping a Teth just to charge the Ming hurts my soul. But hey, the experiment had to be done.

Any Titan at the 9-minute mark is terrifying, no question. With TNA, I could farm Living Legend streaks fast, but one stray Sword Unit could vaporize me. The extra 50 k/s just isn’t worth the gamble. Half your matches, you’ll nuke one bot and your Titan for nothing.

With TRA, on the other hand, survivability improves a lot. You can actually tank one or two Sword Units and sometimes even clap them back.

The biggest threats:

* Teth, since their teleport breaks Cataclysm’s lock-on
* Any stealth bot, for obvious reasons
* Samjok is funny though, once he loses his phaseshift, *zap*, he’s gone

And about that 10-second reload, it sounds rough, but Cataclysms have a huge clip. You can melt 5–6 robots before needing to recharge.

**Conclusion**

This setup fits my playstyle perfectly, high risk, high chaos, and ridiculous fun.  
But sacrificing a Teth for early Titan energy? That’s a no from me.

Mid-game, Ao Ming still performs like a solid brawler, especially once other Titans are out.  
Would I buy Dessa just for this build? Nope.

Still, it’s a wild ride, freaky enough for the Halloween season, and it’s pure joy watching enemies rage-quit after getting caught in your electric storm.",3,1762072263.0,walkingwarrobots,1,1.0,False

[African bee stings on the upswing in Panama](https://newsroompanama.com/2014/02/09/african-bee-stings-on-the-upswing-in-panama/)

February 9, 2014 

MEDICAL emergencies following bites from Africanized bees, which can cause death, are on the upswing in Panama according to the Directorate of Operations of the Fire
 Department of Panama (CBP).

Julio Muñoz, a CBP spokesman, said that during the first 15 days of this year 158 
medical visits were recorded, but the month of January ended up with 645 cases.

In 2012, 5,231 cases were reported, while in 2013, last year 6,504 needed treatment, an 
increase of 1,273.

According to Muñoz, the provinces with the highest incidence are Panama and Los 
Santos . In the case of the metropolitan area, areas that require attention are 
ALcalde Diaz , Juan Diaz , Howard and those adjacent to the former Canal Zone.

The CBP does not keep records fatalities of victims of attacks of the insect , 
as the protocol states that the entity should control the situation, but not
 determine the cause of death.

Roberto Cambra, zoologist at the Museum of Invertebrate zoologist at the University
 of Panama , said the attacks flare up in the dry season and usually occur by accident
 or in homes a colony.

! The attacks flare up in the dry season !

Argentina entomologist Ying said that these insects are characterized by their 
aggressiveness while caring for the colony. They are upset by noise, heat or 
physical contact occurring within 45 meters.

Ying said that the bees have up to 10 migratory cycles per year and have adapted 
to urban areas with minimal vegetation, and buildings.

This species is more aggressive than the European ones that originally came from 
America. However, once in the country, they mixed with European bees and even 
became a single species reports La Prensa.

End of report

In December of 1982 a few swarms of Africanized honeybees arrived near the town
of David, at sea level and 490 km West of Panama City. 

In July of 1983 there were honeybee swarms reported in the northwestern coastal
 town of Bocas del Toro (Adjacent to the Pianista trail). This area lies on the Caribbean, 
the lowlands of which
 receive over twice the annual rainfall of the Pacific coastal area, No honeybees 
were previously maintained in this part of Panama, therefore the swarms were likely 
Africanized.

Also in 1986
3 verified human deaths
occurred from Africanized honeybees, and these accidents
were all due to feral colonies. 

One was
in the vicinity of Volcén, in Chiriqui
Province (1400 m elevation - similar 
elevation to the Kremersfroon night location, 11 kilometers South west) and two
were in central Panama near sea level.

! The 1986 fatality occured only 8 kilometers from the start of the Pianista trail on the adjacent mountainside !

In February 1989 a large
feral colony attacked three fishermen not
far from Barro Colorado Island. 

All were
repeatedly stung and one drowned
in his attempt to swim 50 metres to the shore.

! Bees will cause a person to flee a location in any direction they possibly can !

We previously cited that Panama Canal
Commission field crews suffered 35
stinging incidents during 1985 (Boreham
and Roubik, 1987); in the three years
that followed we have recorded 21, 22
and 16 annual stinging incidents within
the PCC work force.

An introduction to [bees](https://filebin.net/c1ph6yfwtzouoq3t/sizes-honeybee-worker-queen-drone_proc.jpg)

Bees are crucial because they are primary pollinators, vital for food
 production, ecosystem health, and biodiversity. 

They pollinate about
 one-third of the world's food crops and wild plants, enabling them to
 reproduce and produce fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. 

This
 pollination also supports habitats for other wildlife, making bees 
essential to the stability of ecosystems and the survival of many 
species.

Due to the human introduction of the Africanized bee, a hybrid with 
highly aggressive behavior, massive bee sting attacks have markedly 
increased and are now endemic in most of the Americas.

The Africanized bee

In 1956, the Brazilian government introduced the African bee from Africa to it's own
country. They had intended to become a more prominent honey producer. 

The geneticist from Sao Paulo 
obtained an African strain that produced honey very effectively, but was
also very aggressive. 
He returned to Brazil with 47 strains of queens with African homology and crossed
them with the European ones, wanting to create the perfect strain, 

He thought he could suppress the African's ferrocius
 instincts, but before he was able to create this more docile hybrid,
one of his employees accidentally let an African
 queen escape and it bred profusely into the existing gene pool of the european strain,
within nearby communities.

In central and southern Africa, African bees have had to defend themselves against 
other aggressive insects, as well as honey badgers, an animal that also will 
destroy hives if the bees are not sufficiently defensive. In addition, there 
was formerly no tradition of beekeeping, only bee robbing.

When one wanted 
honey, one would seek out a bee tree and kill the colony, or at least steal 
its honey. The colony most likely to survive the predation of its precious honey resource
from animals and humans 
was the one that had the fiercest counter response to these encounters. 

These hardy bees had to adapt to the hostile environment 
of sub-saharan Africa, surviving prolonged droughts while also fighting for nectar. 
Thus the African bee has been naturally selected for ferocity.

African bees have greater defensiveness when in a resting swarm.
It lives more often in ground cavities than the European types and
guards the hive more aggressively, with a hair trigger temper.

An Africanized honey bee colony may have as many as 2000 soldiers ready to 
defend it; the European honey bee colony uses 1/10th that number.

With a higher proportion of ""guard"" bees within the hive,
it deploys a larger number for defense and pursues perceived threats over 
much larger distances from the hive. 

Honey bees from the isthmus of [Panamá averaged 89%](https://filebin.net/c1ph6yfwtzouoq3t/ece38580-fig-0001-m_proc.jpg) African
ancestry while the remaining 11% of their genomes derived from 
the Western European lineage.

In their northern expansion, the African strain had reached Panamá by 1982,
 Costa Rica by 1986, Mexico by 1989, Texas by 1990, and California by 1994

For people that had the misfortune of disturbing a strongly africanized 
hybrid colony, they ended up in the emergency room with over 250 stings.

Killer bees are like most other bees except they swarm for multiple hours 
instead of minutes, when the bee blood hormone is smelt, which represents
the stinger that initiated the attack in the 1st place.

Africanized honey bees are typically much more defensive, react to 
disturbances faster, and chase people farther than other varieties of
 honey bee, up to 400 m (1,300 ft). They have killed some 1,000 humans, 
with victims receiving 10 times more stings than from the European honey bees.

They have also killed horses and other animals.

These are all trigger points for a bee attack:

Loud noises; i.e. barking dogs, car horns, blaring radios.

Vibrations from machinery like chainsaws, weed-eaters, lawnmowers and similar equipment.

Strong perfume/cologne/aftershave.

Shiny jewelery.

Dark-colored clothes.

Black, red or dark blue.

! Black boots, black shorts, red tshirts or dark blue lycra backpacks !

! Red hair or honey badger coloured hair probably doesn't help either!

Colours that attract attacks

Wear light-colored clothing. Honeybees have evolved to 
recognize threats from predators like bears, honey badgers 
and other dark-furred mammals. Also avoid the color red,
 which appears black to bees.

Bees may avoid striped shirts, especially if they are narrow 
and have a contrasting, high-frequency patterns, but the effect
 can be complex and is not fully understood. 

Some research suggests
 that narrow, closely spaced stripes can cause a ""flicker-fusion effect""
 that confuses insects, making them less likely to approach. However,
 other research indicates that bees may be attracted to certain 
striped patterns.

Try wearing clothing which is all one colour;

Any near white or very light color is also good. Dark colors are bad.

I’ve seen people in black or dark blue clothes attacked and 
repeatedly stung by honeybees even when swarming, when normally 
they aren’t defensive.

If provoked, bees tend to attack black first (like the pupil of your eye).
 They quite like blue.

If going into an area that might have wasps, maybe avoid red, gray, dark
 blue, black etc. But realize that light colors won't protect you if they 
think you're a threat. 

I don’t think there’s any colour you can wear which will make them 
completely ignore you. Conversely, I once wore black and yellow 
gardening gloves near a hive and immediately got stung twice in the 
wrist. I think the large, moving, black & yellow edges triggered the 
guard bees’ pattern-recognition and my hands were classified as hornets, 
or at least a threat.

Wear solid white or light colors, smooth in texture. No corduroy or fuzzy
 clothing. Bees are annoyed by red and black colors (they see red as black).
 Wear protective clothing if you're a beekeeper or a hive visitor. Smoke 
the hive. If you're going near a hive, don't wear red or black; avoid 
lemon-scented shampoo; don't wear cologne or perfume; and don't eat a banana.

Bees are most likely to attack and be defensive towards dark colors like black,
 brown, and red, which they perceive as predators like bears. They may 
also be attracted to bright, floral patterns, though dark colors are the most 
likely to provoke an aggressive response.

Dark colors:
Bees associate dark, hairy-looking shapes with predators, so black, brown, 
and dark blue can trigger an attack. 

Red:
Bees cannot see the color red and perceive it as a dark color, so it is one of 
the most aggressive colors to wear.

Peter Underwood · Oct 11, 2020

Longtime beekeeper and beekeeping educator, officer of Southern Arizona Beekeepers Association. 

An average bee hive has around 50,000 bees.

Honey bees prefer not to travel too far to forage for water, whereas they will travel a long 
way for nectar (a 3 mile radius from colony) – so colonies do tend to choose nest sites within
 less than a quarter mile from a dependable water source. 

As far as altitude is concerned, 
Africanized honey bees do not survive well or tolerate colder temperatures where there are 
breaks in nectar availability, so they will not be as prevalent at high altitude, but I
 have seen honey bees foraging in southern Arizona up to 10,000 feet 3km (likely Africanized
 honey bees) and have seen feral established colonies as high as 8,000 feet (likely Africanized). 

For a european genetics colony with enough force, some guard bees will come out and send a
 couple to check you out and maybe consider stinging you, if you seem like a threat –
 maybe just bump you to send you a message.  They will follow you for 10-20 yards to 
push you away from their territory.  

If you disturb an Africanized colony, you will 
be met with quite possibly hundreds of attacking bees or a near firehose of honey 
bees and they will follow you for easily up to a quarter of a mile and immediately 
try to sting you.  

This is where the alarm pheromone is problematic. Once you have
 been stung once, a significant amount of alarm pheromone is released by that stinging 
bee and honey bees have an amazing ability to detect exactly where that pheromone was
 released and will hone in on that exact spot. 

Many cases for hikers getting attacked by Africanized bees, bones were broken as
 they desperately fled down through the boulders and screamed to escape.

Common scenarios they were stung:  

a) on descent, 

b) off-trail, 

c) In a water stream (A wash system). 

d) below 6k feet elevation,

e) very little time gap between buzz and sting I will only comment 
that I can’t see why descent vs ascent would make a difference or 
being off-trail, (other than established colonies on trail are often 
identified and at least in managed parks are often cordoned off or 
trails are closed due to the colony).  Being in a wash could bring 
you in more contact with bees or wasps.  Water streams often have rocky 
walls with void spaces, 

End of Peter Underwood article

When hikers are attacked by a large swarm
of bees, there is a significant fight or flight response that gets
initiated and a hiker would be taking very
drastic measures to flee that area in any
direction possible.

Most of the danger is from feral hives in the wild. Beekeepers
 carefully manage their hives to keep Africanized queens out.

It doesn’t take much to disturb an established colony and there is an 
extremely dangerous outcome.  They respond quickly
 to vibrations in the area and if Africanized honey bees detect you within 20 metres or 50 
feet of a colony, they can start an aggressive response quickly. 

! The day 2 earthquake may have created these vibrations !

Africanized bees responded faster and in much larger numbers than European honey
 bees and produced  to 5.9 to 8.2 times as many stings during two different experiments.

Elizabeth Weise:
""Get away as quickly as possible. Don't jump in water, don't play dead. Don't swat with your
 arms. Just run away as as fast as you can,"" Ellis said. ""You might want to 
pull your shirt up around your nose and mouth to protect against stings that
 could cause swelling of your airway.""

1) If a bee ""bumps into"" you, it's not an accident. Run.

2) If you feel a ""head butt,"" run, because the next thing that comes
 is a full-scale attack by the entire hive.

6 People Killed By 'Killer Bees' After [Bus Crashes](https://filebin.net/c1ph6yfwtzouoq3t/6hid1op_bee-hives_625x300_11_May_23_proc.jpg) into Hives In Nicaragua

A local medical facility handled a number of injured people.

In a tragic accident, a swarm of killer bees stings six people to death, including a mother 
and child, after a bus plunges into hives in Nicaragua.

The unfortunate incident happened during an hour-long journey from Jinotega to San 
Sebastian de Yali.

The bus skidded off the road and fell into a ravine, but tragically, after striking 
several hives, it roused a swarm of killer bees.

According to the New York Post, approximately 45 people were on board the bus when it
 reportedly suffered a mechanical problem, plunging 165 feet down the ravine, and ending 
up in a coffee plantation. 

All people survived the initial crash, but the bus disturbed 
a swarm of killer Africanized bees. The passengers were stung repeatedly by the angry 
insects, with six having reportedly succumbed to the attack.

Retiree hospitalized after killer bee attack

March 5, 2019

Two days after the death of a man attacked by African killer bees in Herrera, a 75-year-old is 
under observation in the emergency room of a hospital in Chiriqui after he and neighbors were
 attacked by a swarm in Boquete.

The incident started while he tried to cut a plant while cleaning the patio of his home and 
disturbed the bees.  Two neighbors and relatives were also attacked. They were all transferred
 to medical centers by the Boquete Fire Department.

Chiriqui firefighters were called to 460 killer bee attacks in the first two months of the year.

End of case studies

Forensic investigators claimed that phosphorus was discovered on Kris's bones, and phosphorus is
also a known component of bee venom.

Bee venom contains phosphorus, primarily as part of the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) 
enzyme, which is a key component of the venom. 

If you disturb an Africanized colony, you will be met with quite possibly hundreds
 of attacking bees and they will follow you for

This bee theory explains why the girls may have left the main trail (before they arrived at the 1st cable bridge)
and why they deviated 300 metres or so, to an unrecognizable area, that resembles the riverbanks of the main Culebra.",7,1762071696.0,KremersFroon,2,0.77,False

I always suggest we split the bill, especially on the second time, (and the succeeding times), that we went out together. sometimes, i end up treating him for coffee or dessert just to make up for him paying the meals.

is it a culture thing, or is it something else? haha sorry stupid question but i hope it makes sense.

also, we haven't really talked about it but would that be already considered a date if we've been seeing each other for multiple times already? but to be honest, it's always almost me who has initiated us seeing each other (for context: we've gone out 5 times and out of that 5, i was the first to invite him out maybe 3 times)

thanks for all your thoughts on this one.",0,1762071672.0,AskAKorean,9,0.5,False

1omby4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdultSelfHarm/comments/1omby4y/this_time_change_sucks/,This time change sucks,"The time change always messes me up bad. It's gonna be glomier and cold. I'm afraid I'm going to be doing it more frequently and that terrifies me. Last, year, I was in a really bad place around this time because of this time change and the things that happened in my life.

The days are gonna be shorter. It's going to get darker at an earlier time. There is gonna be less sunlight. Which means I can't go out for walks/runs as much, due to safety issues. Which sucks because that is what really helps me cope. I'm gonna have to stay home stuck with all my thoughts. I usually try to stay outside as much as possible to avoid being alone when Im feeling depressed or just really bad. 

For instance I'll go to work, then go eat at a public place instead of cooking at home because the cooking utensils can be triggering(if you know what I mean). After, I go to the store for a bit walk around buy random stuff or things I actually need. Then I go to a park and walk some more or just sit and enjoy the scenary/ listen to music. Thankfully, by the time I get home,I'm super tired and just shower drink my tea and sleep. 

The next day, if I feel the same way I do the same thing but I go to a different store 
and restaurant to distract myself and avoid being alone at home. I'll do this for as many days as I need even if they are consecutive days because I'm truly trying to stop but can't. The times I have sh where because I couldn't take it anymore. And  I was getting really bad ideas. I have thought alot about seeing a therapist, but I'm afraid that all this will go on my record and affect my job in some way. Just thinking about the possible consequences makes me feel so anxious; so I rather not. My bf works at night so I can't be with him. He knows I struggle with this and when he can he is there with me. 

I really don't have close friends to hang out and I can't just tell my family ""hey can I come over because I really want to hurt myself"". They actually don't even know I struggle with this since I was a teenager. My family was always busy working trying to make ends meet that they really didn't pay attention to me as I was usually quiet and did well in school. So they never knew and the years just kept going and up to this day they don't know. 

Currently, I  Live with my sister and her family. She is great and I love her a lot, but she is doing her own thing and is usually busy. I also don't want to bother her as she has her own family to take care of and she shouldn't need to be worried about me. She already is doing a lot by allowing me to rent a room in her home. 

Idk what I'm gonna do, hopefully drawing helps. But I usually try to be in public places when the urges get really bad usually I'm at the park, coffee shop, or at the store buying random inexpensive stuff. I think Im gonna go buy some pepper spray just incase one day I need to go out when it's dark. ",2,1762071499.0,AdultSelfHarm,1,1.0,False

To ensure the proper administration and development of Spanish territories in Africa, the Government has established,

The Comisión Especial para el Estudio y Desarrollo de la Guinea Española. 

This body is tasked with examining the economic, social, and strategic situation of Spanish Guinea, including the islands of Fernando Pó, Annobón, Corisco, and the continental region of Río Muni.

Economic Context:
Spanish Guinea represents a modest component of the national economy, with primary exports — cocoa, coffee, and palm oil — contributing approximately 1% of Spain’s Gross Domestic Product. 

Despite its limited economic impact, the territory maintains strategic and political value, preserving Spain’s presence in the Gulf of Guinea and reinforcing national prestige.


Objectives of the Commission:
Assess the current economic situation, including exports, infrastructure, and agricultural productivity.

Investigate opportunities for increased output, through administrative improvements, investment, and technological assistance.

Examine social and labor conditions, balancing productivity with the well-being of the local population.

Evaluate the potential for additional resources, including minerals and hydrocarbons, with the assistance of experts provided by the United States. 

This collaboration aims to identify resources that could enhance the colony’s economic value for spain.


The Comisión Especial will submit a comprehensive report to the Ministry within the next twelve months, offering recommendations regarding administration, economic development, and strategic management of Spanish Guinea",2,1762071436.0,ColdWarPowers,0,1.0,False

1ombwpg,https://i.redd.it/mht1laiqysyf1.jpeg,Affogato in India,"In our country our coffee culture is growing well and we have good cafes coming up in Tier 1 and Tier 2 and few of them have Affogato as an option as well.

But majority of them serve espresso with plain vanilla ice cream instead of Gelato.

From past couple of years wherever I go and find Affogato, first question I ask is if they are using gelato or not. 

Finally found one Italian restaurant in Noida doing that and believe me the texture & taste completely different is huge between when served with Ice cream vs gelato.

I hope more cafes start using gelato for the authentic dessert affogato is.
