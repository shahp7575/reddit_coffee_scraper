Aged around eight, I learned a new word...with the sort of grasp that a dog has on a bicycle; it knows what it looks and sounds like, but really has no idea how to use it properly.

The word was ""appropriate"".

Some kids would want to show off their football skills. Not me; I was the original full on, nerdy bookworm...I simply could not wait to use my new word.

Enter Steve, Mum's first new boyfriend after she divorced my Dad six years previously. Steve seems perfectly nice, but was a little treading on eggshells as it was the first time he'd met me. I think Mum had seen him a few times at work, but this was their first proper date. Steve took a seat and Mum said ""How do you take your coffee, Steve?""

""Black"" he replied.

This is it. This is my moment to impress Mum's new boyfriend with my ever expanding vocabulary...here goes...

""That's appropriate."" I said.

To my Mum's Anglo West Indian boyfriend.

**QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES MAKES HIM FEEL QUADRILLION TIMES BETTER**

SACRILEGE ACTUALLY HITTING PPL IN THE GROUND???? AREAL SHUT UP NOT BEING AVOIDABLE BY JUST JUMPING OR BE 0.1 STUD AWAY?!?!?!? 

HIS R SPECIAL BEING ALWAYS USABLE AND NOT CANCELLING WHEN THE OPPONENT GETS AWAY?!??!

SHUT UP COUNTER NOT BEING ABSOLUTY HORRIBLE TO AIM?!?! 

SHUT UP BEING 4 LESS CD THIS MOVE ITS NOT LONGER A FRICKING 20 CD LONG YAAYYYYY

These changes make him feel REALLY GOOD to play, but as y all know, quality of life isnt everything.   
  
So what they give him that make him not longer g tier?

**THIS FELLA NOW HAS EVASIVE PRESSURE AND NEUTRAL OH MA GOD**

Sacrilege give extra ragdoll time if the opponent was ragdoll and marked means pretty much that if the opponent its on the floor, with an evasive, you can force to use it by using sacrilege. Thanks to the reduce endlag its harder to punish it, and if u do hit it, sacrilege deals true ragdoll while combo into despair, giving you a 30 dmg reward, enough to make the opponent actually don't want get hit by it.

This mean he has EVASIVE PRESSURE YAAYYY, but of course he still need to proc ragdoll, in other words, have an extra help on neutral.

**HE HAS UYAYWDYWAUAY AAAA**

Shut up air variant was always pretty good, but the problem was that the move was on insane 20 cd cooldown, the regular ver was way better dmg wise and Charles didn't really benefit that much when ragdolling an opponent. 

But now that its on a less cd, this mean you can go for it on neutral and still have it on your next interaction.

Also ur R special its still a thing, and you can prob force a Shut up air variant hit against m1 merchants. So yea pretty nasty

Sacrilege evasive bait means that you actually can get pretty good reward by ragdolling the opponent.

of course interruption still its a thing and can get you pretty crazy value if u managed to hit it (which interruption its way more consistent than guardbreaks because only 1 char can react and cancel their abilities in time, No Todo and Yuta don't count they cancel the move but do other move instead so you will get hit by interruption)

in general makes Charles go from G tier to, imo, a low tier or even lowest mid tier. 

Which to be honest, im more than happy that its that way. I don't need this char to be a fucking nuclear bomb. 

**IM LOOKING FOWARD TO MORE BUFFS, WE NEED MORE BUFFS TO BAD CHARS YAAYYYYY** 

**IM NOW A BALANCING TEAM DEFENDER, RAHHHH**

**Summary of Chapter 1** 

The chapter opens with Kyouko preparing breakfast for her husband, Satoshi, who is engrossed in work on his tablet. Kyouko gently reminds him to put his work aside during meals, but Satoshi is preoccupied with business.

Kyouko suggests taking a summer vacation together, but Satoshi dismisses the idea, citing his busy work schedule. Kyouko expresses frustration, feeling neglected and ignored.

The conversation shifts to their son, Haruki, who is on summer holiday from college. Kyouko voices her concern about Haruki's lack of romantic involvement, noting that he has never been seen with a girl.

Satoshi initially brushes off her concerns, but Kyouko persists, detailing Haruki's behavior during high school and his lack of interest in girls. She mentions that Haruki received chocolates from many girls but gave them identical, inexpensive gifts in return.

As they discuss this, Haruki enters the room, and Satoshi directly asks him, ""Are you gay?"" Haruki is taken aback and denies it, sputtering his coffee in surprise.

The chapter ends with Haruki's denial, leaving the question of his sexual orientation unresolved and setting the stage for further exploration of family dynamics and personal identities.

My take was to control the exact wattage in time stamps for coffee Roasting due to not being able to have specific control over heat or a way to currently measure it. 

NOTE: I haven't tried the coffee yet but wanted to share my experience. 

Roast Chart:

* **Rolling FC**: 6:15

For wattage if you are using a different machine I tried to go with the minimum Wattage that could allow bean movement, and also learn what is the minimum Wattage that would get me to FC. Took a couple tries but I found out it was roughly 900Watts

  
Wattage Chart: **Note:** Poppo max watts is 1250W

* **Baseline (repeat this)**
* 0:00 — 750W (stir hard)

From 2023 to 2026, I applied to jobs nonstop in finance. I worked hard, took certifications back to back, studied companies, practiced interviews, networked, went on coffee chats, learned the corporate language, all of it.  What's crazy is recruiters who work at banking companies tell me my resume is pretty good during networking events. And after three years of that effort, I landed about five interviews total. Every time I considered quitting, people told me not to, that something would come eventually. I listened. Now I’ve landed a role as a finance assistant, a job I would have been excited about at 23. But seeing the low pay of 30k and heavy workload now, it feels like I stressed myself out for nothing.

There’s a specific kind of drive you have in your early 20s, especially around 23 and 24, when you’re just stepping into the world and you’re determined to reach your goals no matter what. I applied to over 3,000+ jobs during that time. Looking back, I wish I had put that same energy into a career that offered stability, like nursing, so I could live my life and figure things out along the way instead of constantly being in survival mode.

What hurts the most is knowing I won’t get those three years back. My family looks at me like I wasn’t doing much, when in reality I was constantly applying, studying, preparing, and pushing myself.

Before traveling to China I was worried if I could find any vegan food to eat in all of the cities I planned to visit,  but I actually was impressed by how much easier it was compared to eating vegan in Europe (restaurants). I would like to share my experiences and give some tips for everyone who wants to visit this amazing country! 🇨🇳

First of all, do not worry about finding vegan restaurants if you travel to big cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Guangzhou, etc. There are plenty of options! 🌱

In smaller villages you can find accidentally vegan dishes on the menu or ask workers/owners to cook a simple custom dish for you (like noodles with veggies, mushrooms, and tofu). 

And if you plan to live in China and you love to cook, it seems like a paradise country to get any ingredient you want: lion's mane mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, different kinds of tofu (stinky, hairy, silky,..), unusual greens, weird reddish, etc.

China is full of vegan food because of Buddhists who practice not eating meat and a lack of milk in traditional Chinese cuisine. Also, vegan restaurants will try to fit the Buddhist diet and exclude onions, chives, leeks, and, asafoetida from used ingredients. But it doesn't make the food worse at all, it's a good opportunity to explore new flavours. 

Here are some tips:

1. You can find many vegan places on Happy Cow but you can as well search ""Vegetarian"" or ""素食"" in Amaps (Chinese analog of Google maps). Seems that veganism didn't reach China so widely so even completely vegan restaurants are called ""Vegetarian"" as this is the therm chinese people are aware of. 

2. Most people I met there do not speak English so you have to prepare a paper note (I prefer this option as it may be easier to manipulate and easier to read), or, as a minimum, a text on your phone. I have a template to print and glue together (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EZy2uOFPwe9RS8tl70YXbMRVld8ng33LLIqlulycrHY/edit?usp=drivesdk), I was mostly using the second row phrase as it's shorter and not too overwhelming for others. The first note was taken from another Reddit post and improved after reading comments of Chinese natives.
So this note can help you at buffets in your hotel or at any non-vegan cafe/restaurant.

3. If you do not know where to eat, go to the nearest temple and ask people there, they will gladly recommend you something. Chinese people are pretty friendly, especially volunteers at temples. Hotel reception workers are also an option. 😁

4. In Chinese coffee shops like Luckin Coffee you can ask workers to show you milk package for specific drink you want to order. I found out that the milk they use for Raw Coconut Latte is vegan! 🥥

5. Get e-sim or a Chinese sim card with a good VPN to be able to use Google photo translator to check ingredients. Also, it's VERY important to install something like Tap Translate app so it would translate everything on your screen. Sometimes if you order through WeChat or Alipay in the restaurant, the app itself doesn't translate all of the text of the menu.

6. If you travel to nature or villages, buy snacks in local shops (of course you should check ingredients).

In general, meals are very affordable but be prepared to spend a lot of time riding metro to get to the restaurant (it takes a minimum of 30 mins) or pay for a taxi, which would cost you 2-3€.

Regarding other aspects like buying clothing and shoes - you better check labels and shoe boxes for materials yourself to know for sure.

I hope some of my advice will help you on your trip to China. I've been there for three weeks only so I cannot call myself an expert but I visited a lot of cities and tried a lot of delicious vegan food (I attach pictures of some of the vegan dishes I tried). If you have any questions, I will try to help you as much as I can. 😊

Have a great day! ☀️",9,1769327388.0,VeganFoodPorn,0,1.0,False

1qmcyf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1qmcyf2/i_created_before_leaving_app_after_forgetting_my/,I created before leaving app after forgetting my car,"Hey Reddit,

I’m an iOS developer, and about 13 years ago I built an app called Before Leaving.

There’s actually a crazy story behind why I created it. Around that time, life was… intense. Work was stressful, and my mom was battling cancer, so I was juggling both. One night, after taking care of her following a chemo session, I went to work at a coffee shop until 3 AM. I was mentally exhausted, drained, and completely stressed.

In that state, I somehow left the coffee shop and went home… without even taking my car. I woke up the next day and couldn’t remember taking it at all. I panicked, took my uncle with me, and went to the police to file a stolen car report. On the way back, my uncle casually asked, “Where were you sitting last night?” I said the coffee shop, and he replied, “Let’s check there.”

Yep… the car was still there 😅 Embarrassing doesn’t even begin to cover it. That’s when I decided I needed a system to never forget important things — and that became the seed of Before Leaving.

At the time, the app was built for iOS 5, entirely in Objective-C, and there wasn’t even a proper way to do grids in the UI. It worked, but it was limited by the platform and my skills at the time. Marketing was incredibly hard, and my UX experience was limited, so I tried to do everything myself — development, design, and promotion. Needless to say, it was a huge learning experience.

Last year, I decided to rewrite the entire app from scratch. iOS has changed massively since iOS 5, and so has my experience as a developer. I used the rewrite to modernize the architecture, rethink the UX, and add features that actually support the core idea instead of bloating it.

What the app does today:

	•	Create time-based reminders for specific moments

	•	Create location-based reminders that trigger when you arrive at or leave a place

	•	Create shared group reminders for you, your family, or friends (households, couples, trips, etc.)

	•	Build checklists for places like home, work, gym, airport, or travel

	•	Use AI to quickly create reminders instead of typing everything manually

	•	Choose from 6 themes and optional gamification (streaks, achievements, progress tracking)

Home Hub (personalized experiences):

	•	Pet care routines (feeding, walking, vet reminders)

	•	Plant tracking and care schedules

	•	Safety checks (doors, stove, lights, alarms)

	•	Health & nutrition reminders

	•	Bills & subscriptions tracking

	•	Shopping lists and recurring household tasks

Plus:

	•	Widgets, Apple Watch support, Live Activities, and Siri Shortcuts

	•	Works offline and is privacy-focused (no account required unless you use sharing)

The app has been live on the App Store for years, was fully rewritten recently, and is still being actively used — which honestly keeps me motivated to keep improving it.

App Store link:

https://apps.apple.com/de/app/before-leaving/id719622441?l=en-GB

I’m genuinely looking for honest feedback:

	•	Does this idea still make sense in 2025?

	•	Do the features feel useful or too much?

	•	What would you remove, change, or rethink?

Happy to hear praise, criticism, or brutal honesty 😄

1qmcxz6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qmcxz6,An honest review of TJ's Almond croissant,"Hello so today I tried the trader Joe's Almond croissant for the first time today and I'd like to pop in to give my honest review

Disclaimer: almond croissants are my favorite pastry and my love for almond croissants has me spending countless hours searching bakery to bakery to find almond croissants, I am always in search of this pastry so when I found trader Joe's had them I gasped in the store and nearly fainted in delight when I first found the box

So I bring em home, after the snowstorm hits and after I finish watching this Alex honnold dude climb a skyscraper in Taipei I pop my oven to 350.  It's telling me to wait 8 hours before putting them in the oven, but I ignore this and throw the 4 almond croissants that come in the box onto a pan.

I have a deep respect for almond croissants so I dressed each of them up a bit, with a pinch of some sprinkles and a warm blanket of powdered sugar I cozied them up and said my goodbyes as I sent them away to bake and cook in the oven.

I couldn't leave my almond croissants so I sat right by the oven, I got to admit I wasn't impressed by what they looked like when I pulled them out the box, they were kinda flat, but I had to see what it would look like after cooking and most importantly how will they taste and what will the texture feel like?

Around 5 minutes in the oven I start to notice they are sizzling a little bit to the bottom of the pan, like as if there is butter already inside of the croissant is the way the sizzle looked

Around 10 minutes in the oven and they still looked flat and were sizzling

At around 13 minutes I was getting nervous, I didn't know what they would look like by minute 20 which was what the box called for

15 minutes in the oven and I see my beautiful almost ready almond croissants start to blossom and puff up and the flat plain soon because a mountainous ridge.

And around the 15 minute mark the air around  the oven started to smell of a faint almond cream filling smell, that wonderful delightful smell starts penetrating through the stillness of the room and I start to feel my body is in great anticipation for this almond croissant

Any feelings of doubt or anxiety that I was having was leaving my body as for the next 5 minutes the smell grew, like a blossoming flower that is inviting a bee, it was me who was to be, to be eating the fruit of the ovens labor that is the almond croissants.

At around 21 minutes exactly I notice some of the cream on the inside of the almond croissant popped through it's doughy shell and I decided at that point to pull out my pan and see what the oven has created for me

They were soft to the touch, like perfect croissant texture if fluffyness and softness, easily malleable to the touch.

With a fork and a gentle motion I put my almond croissants onto a plate and brought them into my bedroom near my TV so I could do the final examination

As I was blessed with the grace of my Roku putting on YouTube I started the motions of eating.

As I picked up the almond croissant and took my first bite I had the thought fill the airspace of my brain saying ""this is better tasting than any pillsbury toaster strutel that I've ever had""

As I took my 2nd bite I thought ""this is exactly what an almond croissant is supposed to feel like"". The soft texture with that warm hot creamy center, I took bite after bite until the first almond croissant sat in pieces within comfort of stomach.

An overwhelming sensation of satisfaction was pouring through my beautiful heart as I devoured a second almond croissant, however something unexpected happened as I finished eating my 2nd almond croissant I felt so satisfied that I managed to wrap up the third and fourth almond croissants and out them in the fridge for later.

It was the perfect snack.

And tomorrow I'll be able to eat one fresh out of the fridge, as if it was made a night before and sitting out in a bakery waiting for me to find the next day whilst getting coffee.

The last two almond croissants are waiting for me and right now they can be waiting for you too if you plan on giving them a chance.

My final rating for trader Joe's almond croissants is that they are 9 out of 10.

Congratulations and thank you to trader Joe's for making this delicious treat more accessible.

If you like almond croissants, go give these a try next time you're at trader Joe's.",2,1769327220.0,traderjoes,5,0.56,False

What I am looking for? 

I am quite vanilla, so mostly what I am looking for is someone I can have a decent conversation with and have a good intimate time with. 

I don’t have any over the top kinks and I mostly believe in a good emotional connection and mutual consent. 

Why am I looking for a sugar baby? 

I got into a sugar relationship when I had my first sugar baby about 1.5 years ago. I somehow feel sugar relationships are more straightforward in which both are expectations from each other are set in advance. 

What am I willing to offer? 

I am willing to offer an allowance of 40k a month. Plus dinner and dates and any other expenses on the meet are on me too 

Was I in a sugar relationship before? 

Yes I had one sugar relationship before but the girl had to love out of bangalore after graduation so had to end it there. It lasted for a year. 

Who would be my ideal partner? 

Someone who is talkative in general and like older men. 

Few points to note: 

I do not have a type. For me it is more about how I connect to a person and less about any particular physical attribute of them 

I also do not care about your personal life outside of the time we meet. And I would appreciate it if you keep it the same way. 

I will also not give you any gift cards or anything before we meet but I am open to having a telephonic conversation and then a coffee meet to see how we connect to each other.

Before you worry about the poor cafe going bankrupt because I’m taking up a table, last time I did this I spend about $75 in coffee and crumpets in 2.5 hours and took up a single seat on a communal table. I don’t need much room and have an incredible capacity to drink the black stuff.

This being said, I realise cafes open will be doing so to take advantage of people’s availability and day off, so someone that has single or communal tables would be best, I don’t want to occupy a 2 or 4 seater table whilst i work.

Happy to travel a bit to get to it, starting in Salisbury area. Need someone who might be in the know for a place that will fit the bill well. Can get creative too- somewhere peaceful, bustling, funky, private, open to options.

So, I've had horrible (and progressively worse) stomach issues for the past 13-14 years. I'm about to be 25. It started with intense nausea and IBS like symptoms, and it comes in waves I call flare ups. At this point there are weeks where I live on smoothies because its all I can keep down. The last time I had a flare up, I had to go to the ER because I had rectal bleeding (not a smear on TP, a steady stream of droplets), coffee grounds emesis, severe abdominal pain (it felt like parts of my intestines were burning, kinda like acid reflux but in my gut), couldn't keep anything down, etc. They told me they were gonna send me home and that I should follow up with a GI to get a colonoscopy/endoscopy. I've had those before, I've worked with a GI doc before, it's so hard to get in to see the doctor/schedule a procedure during a flare up, where I live the schedule is usually a few months out. I can never time it so they catch whatever is going on. So at this point I just break down crying, I told the ER doc that I needed some kind of direction to push here. I needed answers, I needed to know where to look, I needed help. He ended up telling me it was almost certainly some IBD, probably Crohns over UC because the upper digestive tract is also affected, but that he couldn't diagnose me in the ER for it because of protocol, the CT didn't show anything. I asked him if it was possible that I just didn't have enough permanent damage or scarring or inflammation at that very moment that would cause it not to show up. He said it's not only possible but probable with the history I gave. From what I've read it can, in some cases, be hard to diagnose before 30 because of this. Anyway, they sent me on my way and told me to call my GP to be referred to GI for a colonoscopy/endoscopy. I'm still waiting on that appt, but I've had all that before, and nothing showed up, but like I said I've never been able to get in during a flare up. They gave me a list of diets to try (really just AIP and Paleo) and sent me on my way. I get really frustrated because it feels like I have to be beyond the point of no return with scarring and such to get help, or get extremely lucky and have a flare up when I'm already scheduled for an exploratory procedure.

So, my questions are:

How does this compare to your experience if you're diagnosed? Not asking for medical advice, but I wanna compare to make sure I'm on the right track.

What do I do to get help for this? If diagnosis isn't currently an option, what can I do to mitigate in the mean time?

Those of you who are older than me, what did/do your 30s/40s look like with Crohns?

Thanks in advance, and please be kind. I dont wanna be coddled, but I don't wanna be crucified if I'm mistaken either. I just want answers, I'm so lost at this point.",1,1769326460.0,CrohnsDisease,4,1.0,False

Phones being scanned in restaurants and coffee shops.","Ok for starters I am not doing this business. It was just an idea for anyone. I went to Japan a few years ago and this reminds me of something Japanese would embrace:

Basically on your phone you have a streaming app that syncs with the restaurant via AI voting. 

You can manually train it or it scan your Playlist.

Based on the consensus that is what gets played. Then there is a backup category of tolerance.

I got this idea from trying to escape loud music in the buffet on a cruise ship. I went over to the ""Main Dining Room"" that is more formal and required an organized reservation. 

In the dining area was mostly elderly. The hilarious thing was they were blasting Millenial and Gen Z music. 

I feel like the app would have been playing Fleetwood Mac, Beatles, and Frank Sinatra. 

I just thought it was more pleasant. 

If a restaurant gets flooded with Gen X or other groups the music will automatically change.

If people don't want to participate they don't. 

It reminds me of a jukebox. You have to have the app to be in control.

If a restaurant has an ethnic theme than people can vote and program those categories within that genre.

I play Spanish music at my commercial location when people from Mexico are doing handyman work. They love it.

""We need to talk,"" Ethan said.

My stomach dropped.

""What do you mean?""

""I mean,I want us to experience everything life has to offer"" he said,

""I don't want us to look back in twenty years and wonder 'what if.'""

He stepped closer, his voice dropping"" So we needs to be with someone.""

""Who? Who are you talking about?""my voice soaked.

""Sarah,"" he said.

My best friend.The name hung in the air between us, suspended like a guillotine blade.

The room tilted. I gripped the sink, metal biting into my palms.

""No,"" I said. It came out as a gasp.

""Think about it, Maya,"" he said quickly, stepping forward as if to catch me.

""She's perfect. The chemistry is already there—we all get along. It would be... natural. It would be safe.""

In that moment, I realized he wasn’t asking for my consent.

He was asking me to step aside.

————————

I noticed it first at 2:14 a.m.

The red numbers on the digital clock glowed like a fresh wound in the darkness, pulsating with a silence that felt louder than a scream. I was wide awake, paralyzed beside a man who used to make sleep feel effortless.

Above us, the ceiling fan rotated with a soft, uneven click-hiss, click-hiss. It was a rhythmic, hypnotic sound that I had once found comforting, like a heartbeat mimicking the steady pulse of our life together. But tonight, in the suffocating stillness of our bedroom, it didn't sound like a heartbeat.

It sounded like a countdown.

Beside me, Ethan breathed in a slow, deep cadence. The sheet was tangled around his waist, exposing the broad, sculpted expanse of his back. Even in the dim light, he was beautiful. A masterpiece of muscle and warm skin that I had memorized with my fingertips a thousand times. Just hours ago, those hands had been gripping my hips, anchoring me to the mattress, worshiping me with a fervor that made me feel like the only woman on earth. The scent of our intimacy—musk, sweat, and expensive cologne—still hung heavy in the air, a ghost of the passion that had consumed us before sleep took him.

He looked peaceful. Innocent, even. His face was buried partially in the pillow, his dark hair messy, his lips slightly parted. He looked like the man who had promised to build a world with me. The man who checked my tires before I drove long distances. The man who knew exactly how I took my coffee and exactly where to touch me to make my breath hitch.

I lay rigid on my side, afraid to move. Afraid that if I shifted even an inch, the fragile architecture of my ribcage would collapse and crush my lungs.

I didn't know yet what I was losing.

There was no evidence. No lipstick on a collar, no receipt in a pocket, no late-night phone call that he scrambled to hide. Just a feeling. A cold, insidious drop in the pit of my stomach that whispered something was wrong. It was the primitive instinct of a prey animal sensing a predator in the tall grass, even when the wind was still.

I reached out, my hand hovering inches above his shoulder. I wanted to shake him awake. I wanted to demand he tell me that we were okay, that the sudden, crushing weight in my chest was just anxiety, just a nightmare bleeding into reality. I wanted him to pull me into his chest, wrap his heavy arms around me, and tell me I was being ridiculous.

But I pulled my hand back.

Because what if he didn't?

What if I woke him up, and the stranger beneath his skin finally opened his eyes?

The fan clicked again. Tick. Tick. Tick.

I closed my eyes, trying to force the air back into my lungs, trying to summon the memory of how safe I had felt just yesterday. But the safety was gone, replaced by a terrifying clarity.

Trust is a heavy thing. We build our lives on it, layer by layer, assuming the foundation is solid rock. We never stop to check if the ground beneath us is shifting. We never stop to check if the person holding the other end of the rope has already let go.

Ethan shifted in his sleep, his arm reaching out blindly to drape over my waist. It was a reflex. Muscle memory. A gesture of possession and comfort.

For the first time in two years, his touch didn't feel like home.

It felt like a lie.

I stared at the red numbers on the clock—2:15 a.m.—and realized that the man sleeping beside me wasn't my savior. He was the storm I never saw coming.

And I was already drowning.

\###Chapter 1: The Rhythm of Us

If Sunday mornings were a religion, Ethan was the high priest, and our apartment was the altar.

I woke to the smell of roasted hazelnut and the soft, scratching sound of a pen against paper. For a long moment, I kept my eyes closed, letting the sunlight warm my eyelids, luxuriating in the heavy, sated feeling of my own limbs. The terror of the night before—or the night to come, I wasn't sure which timeline I was living in anymore—felt a lifetime away. In this moment, the air smelled like safety.

I stretched, my toes curling against the high-thread-count sheets Ethan had insisted on buying because he claimed I deserved to sleep on clouds. The space beside me was empty, the sheets cooling, but I didn't feel alone. I never felt alone in this apartment. Every corner of it, from the mid-century modern armchair in the corner to the abstract art we'd picked out together in a gallery in Chelsea, screamed us.

I threw the duvet back and padded out of the bedroom, wearing nothing but one of his discarded dress shirts. It hung to my mid-thigh, the cuffs swallowing my hands. I loved the way I looked in his clothes—small, claimed, wrapped in his scent.

Ethan was in the kitchen, leaning against the quartz island, a sketchbook open in front of him.

He was breathtaking. It was a fact I still hadn't gotten used to, even after two years. He was wearing grey sweatpants that hung low on his hips, leaving his torso bare. His back was to me, the muscles shifting beneath his skin as he reached for his mug. He was broad-shouldered, built with the kind of lean, functional strength that didn't come from a gym but seemed woven into his DNA. His dark hair was sleep-tousled, a rare imperfection in a man who lived his life with architectural precision.

He was an architect, after all. He built things. He understood structure, load-bearing walls, and how to keep things from collapsing. Maybe that's why I trusted him with my heart. I assumed he treated it with the same reverence he treated his blueprints—calculating the risks, reinforcing the weak spots.

""You're staring,"" he said, his voice a low rumble. He didn't turn around.

""I'm admiring the view,"" I countered, leaning against the doorframe.

He turned then, and the smile that broke across his face hit me in the chest like a physical blow. It was the smile he saved just for me—soft, unguarded, stripping away the cool, professional veneer he wore for the rest of the world. His eyes, the color of dark espresso, swept over me, lingering on the exposed skin of my legs before dragging slowly up to my face.

""Coffee is ready,"" he said, tapping the ceramic mug beside him. ""Two sugars, a splash of oat milk. 190 degrees.""

""Precision,"" I teased, walking toward him.

""Perfection,"" he corrected, catching me by the waist as soon as I was within reach.

He pulled me between his legs, his hands settling heavy and hot on my hips. The contact was electric. It always was. Two years in, and the static shock of his skin against mine hadn't faded; if anything, it had intensified, evolving from the frantic sparks of new love into a steady, humming current that powered my entire world.

I wrapped my arms around his neck, burying my nose in the crook of his shoulder. He smelled of soap and espresso and that distinct, masculine scent that was just Ethan.

""You were up early,"" I murmured against his skin.

""Couldn't sleep,"" he said, pressing a buss to the top of my head. ""I had an idea for the skylight on the renovation project. Wanted to get it down before it faded.""

""Always working.""

""Building our future, Maya,"" he said softly. He pulled back just enough to look me in the eye, his expression turning serious. ""Everything I do is for that.""

My heart swelled, pressing tight against my ribs. I believed him. God, I believed him.

He lifted me effortlessly, setting me onto the edge of the island counter. The sketchbook slid aside. His hands moved from my hips to my thighs, his thumbs tracing lazy, possessive circles against the sensitive skin there. The casual intimacy of it made my breath hitch.

""Drink your coffee,"" he commanded softly, handing me the mug.

I took a sip. It was perfect. Of course it was. Ethan didn't do mistakes.

""What do you want to do today?"" I asked, watching him over the rim of the mug. ""The market? Maybe a walk by the river?""

He stepped closer, moving into the space between my knees. The air in the kitchen shifted, thickening, the domestic tranquility curdling into something darker, heavier. His eyes darkened, the pupils blowing wide until they nearly swallowed the iris.

""Eventually,"" he said. His voice dropped an octave, rough with a sudden, spiking need. ""But right now? I have other priorities.""

He took the mug from my hand and set it aside without breaking eye contact. Then, his hands slid up, slipping under the hem of the shirt. His palms were rough against my ribs, his fingers splaying out to encompass me.

""Ethan,"" I breathed, my head falling back as he leaned in, his lips grazing the sensitive column of my throat.

""You look beautiful in my shirt,"" he growled against my skin, his teeth grazing my pulse point. ""But I think I'd prefer you out of it.""

He didn't wait for an answer. He didn't need to. My body was already answering for me, softening, opening, reacting to his proximity with a conditioned response that felt inevitable.

His hands moved with confident ownership, unbuttoning the shirt with maddening slowness. One button. A buss to the hollow of my throat. Two buttons. A buss to the swell of my chest. By the time the fabric fell open, I was trembling, my hands gripping his shoulders to anchor myself.

""You are so responsive,"" he whispered, stepping back to look at me. His gaze felt like a physical touch, tracing every curve, every scar, every inch of skin I usually hid from the world. But I never hid from him. Under his gaze, I didn't feel exposed; I felt seen. ""So perfect.""

He leaned in and bussed me—not a peck, but a devouring. His tongue swept into my mouth, tasting me, claiming me. It was a buss that tasted of coffee and hunger. I wrapped my legs around his waist, pulling him flush against me, needing to feel the solidity of him, the heavy weight of his desire.

He groaned low in his throat, a sound of pure male appreciation that vibrated against my lips. He lifted me again, carrying me not to the bedroom, but to the living room, laying me down on the plush rug in front of the window where the morning sun was pouring in.

""Ethan, the neighbors,"" I gasped, though I didn't actually care.

""Let them look,"" he murmured, settling over me, his weight a heavy blanket that blocked out the rest of the world. He braced himself on his forearms, framing my face, boxing me in. ""Let them see that you're mine.""

The intercourse that followed wasn't frantic. It was a slow, deliberate worship. Ethan got laid with like he designed buildings—with intent. Every touch had a purpose. He knew exactly where to place his hands to make me gasp. He knew the precise rhythm that made my hips buck involuntarily.

He stripped the shirt from my shoulders, tossing it aside, leaving me bare in the sunlight. He took his time, his mouth moving over my body, mapping me. When he finally entered me, I cried out, the sound sharp in the quiet apartment.

""Look at me, Maya,"" he commanded, his voice strained.

I opened my eyes, meeting his gaze. It was intense, burning with something that looked so much like devotion it made my chest ache.

""I am right here,"" he whispered, his thrusts deep and steady, grounding me to the floor, to him, to this moment. ""I've got you.""

I wrapped my arms around his neck, pulling him down until our foreheads rested together. We moved in a synchronized rhythm, a dance we had perfected over seven hundred days of loving each other. There was no awkwardness, no hesitation. Just the seamless friction of two bodies that fit together like a lock and key.

As the pressure built, coiling tight in my belly, I clung to him. I felt the tension in his shoulders, the way his breath hitched in time with mine.

""Let go,"" he whispered against my ear, his hand sliding between us to push me over the edge. ""I've got you. Fall.""

And I did. I shattered.

The climax ripped through me, a white-hot wave that curled my toes and tore a sob from my throat. I squeezed my eyes shut, seeing stars, feeling his name like a prayer on my lips. Moments later, I felt him shudder above me, his control finally snapping as he followed me into the abyss, groaning my name like it was the only word he knew.

Afterward, we lay tangled in the sunlight, limbs heavy, breathing slowly returning to normal. He rolled to his side, pulling me against his chest, his arm draped protectively over me. He bussed the damp hair at my temple.

""I love you, Maya,"" he whispered into the silence.

I traced the line of a tattoo on his ribcage—a geometric design he'd gotten years ago. ""I love you too.""

I closed my eyes, listening to the steady beat of his heart under my ear. Thump-thump. Thump-thump.

It was the steadiest sound in the world.

I thought about the chaos of my job, the uncertainty of my career, the messy world outside these walls. But in here? In this sun-drenched circle of his arms?

I was untouchable.

I tightened my arm around him, holding on as if the gravity of the earth depended on it. I didn't know then that the man holding me was already loosening his grip. I didn't know that this Sunday—this perfect, golden, holy Sunday—was the last one I would ever truly have.

""Coffee?"" he asked softly, breaking the spell.

""Please,"" I smiled, looking up at him. ""But don't be too long.""

""I'm never going anywhere,"" he promised.

And God help me, I believed him.

\###Chapter 2: The Third Strand

If Ethan was my anchor, Sarah was my sail.

Where Ethan was steady earth and calculated lines, Sarah was wind and fire. She was the person who convinced me to dye my hair pink in grad school (a mistake), the one who dragged me to salsa classes I had no rhythm for, and the only person on earth who knew the exact code to dismantle my defenses when I was spiraling.

I pushed open the heavy oak doors of Vesper, the wine bar we'd claimed as our sanctuary three years ago. The air inside was cool and smelled of expensive gin and rosemary. I spotted her immediately in the back booth—the one with the velvet upholstery that matched the deep burgundy of her lipstick.

Sarah didn't just sit in a room; she curated it. She was scrolling on her phone, bathed in the amber glow of the pendant lights, looking like a Vogue editor on a deadline. Her blonde bob was sharp enough to cut glass, her posture immaculate. When she looked up and saw me, her face transformed from cool indifference to radiant warmth.

""There she is,"" she announced, her voice carrying that distinct, husky timber that made men turn their heads. "" The woman who has it all.""

I slid into the booth opposite her, exhaling the stress of the workday. ""I definitely don't have it all. I have a headache and a stack of grant applications that are going to kill me.""

""Please,"" Sarah scoffed, reaching across the table to squeeze my hand. Her rings—gold bands on almost every finger—pressed cool against my skin. ""You have the job, the hair, and the man. Let's focus on the important part. How is the Lord of Architecture?""

I couldn't help the smile that tugged at my lips. Sarah had nicknamed Ethan ""The Lord of Architecture"" six months into our relationship, claiming his jawline was structurally significant enough to be a landmark.

""He's good,"" I said, signaling the waiter for a Pinot Noir. ""Busy. Stressed about the skylights on the chaotic renovation project downtown, but good. He made me breakfast this morning.""

Sarah groaned, throwing her head back theatrically. ""Of course he did. Did he also rescue a kitten on his way to work and solve world hunger during his lunch break?""

""He did fix the leaky faucet in the bathroom before he left,"" I admitted, grinning.

Sarah picked up her martini, inspecting the olive. ""God, he is disgusting. He's so perfect it makes my teeth hurt. You know that, right? You are living in a room, and the rest of us are stuck in a gritty indie documentary about dating failures.""

I laughed, but a warm flush of pride spread through my chest. It was valid, wasn't it? To feel proud of the life you'd chosen? To feel a thrill when your best friend—the woman with the highest standards of anyone you knew—looked at your partner and saw gold?

""He's not perfect,"" I lied, trying to be humble. ""He leaves his socks on the floor.""

""Oh, the horror,"" Sarah deadpanned. ""Divorce him immediately. I'll take him off your hands. I'm great at picking up socks.""

We both laughed, clinking our glasses together. It was a joke. It was always a joke. Sarah's humor was dry, cutting, and often self-deprecating about her own disastrous dating life.

""Seriously though,"" she said, her expression softening into something sincere. ""I'm happy for you, Maya. You deserve this. After everything with... you know. The Dark Ages.""

The Dark Ages. That was what we called my life before Ethan. The year I dropped out of my PhD program, broke off an engagement with a man who belittled me, and ended up sleeping on Sarah's microfiber couch for three months.

I looked at her, really looked at her. Beneath the designer blazer and the carefully applied contour, I saw the woman who had held my hair back while I vomited from stress. The woman who had laid in bed with me for three days straight, watching terrible reality TV and feeding me toast because I couldn't manage anything else.

People talk about romantic soulmates, but they rarely mention the platonic ones. The friends who know the geography of your trauma better than you do. Sarah wasn't just my friend; she was the witness to my resurrection. She had seen me broken, and she had helped glue the pieces back together until I was whole enough to meet someone like Ethan.

""I couldn't have gotten here without you,"" I said softly, the gratitude sudden and thick in my throat.

Sarah waved her hand dismissively, though her eyes shimmered. ""Don't get sentimental on me. I only helped you because I needed someone to split the rent.""

""Liar.""

""Okay, fine. I love you. Whatever."" She took a long sip of her drink, her eyes scanning my face. ""But really. Two years. That's the danger zone, you know.""

I frowned, swirling my wine. ""Danger zone?""

""The itch,"" she said, raising an eyebrow. ""The routine. You know I love Ethan, he is literally the blueprint for modern masculinity, but... doesn't it ever get boring? The same coffee, the same love, the same conversations?""

I thought about this morning. The way he had looked at me on the kitchen island. The way he had devoured me with a hunger that felt anything but routine.

""No,"" I said honestly. ""It doesn't. He... keeps things interesting.""

Sarah's gaze dropped to the faint, reddish mark on my neck that I had tried to cover with concealer. A small, knowing smirk curled the corner of her mouth.

""I see,"" she purred, leaning in closer. ""Well, go on then. Spill. I need to live vicariously through you since my last date tried to explain NFTs to me for forty-five minutes.""

I shouldn't have told her. I know that now. There are things that should remain sacred between two people, intimate geographies that shouldn't be mapped out for an audience. But this was Sarah. My sister in everything but blood. There were no boundaries between us because we had never needed them.

So I told her. Not everything—I spared the explicit details—but I told her about the intensity. The way he looked at me. The way he made me feel worshipped.

Sarah listened with an intensity that matched her focus on art or fashion. She didn't look away. She drank in the details, her eyes dark and unreadable.

""He sounds... consuming,"" she said finally, tracing the rim of her glass.

""In a good way,"" I added quickly. ""I feel safe.""

""Safety is good,"" Sarah murmured, almost to herself. ""But passion? That's rare. To have both? That's like winning the lottery twice.""

She reached into her purse and pulled out her phone as it buzzed. She glanced at the screen, and for a split second, a shadow passed over her face—something sharp, guilty, or maybe just annoyed. It was gone so fast I thought I imagined it.

""Is everything okay?""

""Work,"" she sighed, flipping the phone face down on the table. ""My boss is a nightmare. Enough about me. When are we doing dinner? The three of us? I feel like I haven't seen Ethan in ages, and I need to ask him about that new high-rise going up on 5th. I'm thinking of moving.""

""You should come over Friday,"" I said. ""I'll make that risotto you like. Ethan has been asking about you, actually. He mentioned he hasn't seen you since the gala.""

""Has he?"" Sarah's voice pitched up slightly, a tiny, almost imperceptible crack. She cleared her throat. ""That's sweet. I assumed he was too busy building empires to think about little old me.""

""You're hardly 'little old you,'"" I laughed. ""You're the third member of the unit, Sarah. You know that. We're a package deal. You, me, and him.""

Sarah smiled then, but it didn't quite reach her eyes. It was a tight, brittle thing. ""The Unit. I like that. Although, be careful, Maya. You keep inviting me into your perfect domestic bubble, and I might just decide not to leave.""

""We wouldn't want you to leave,"" I said, draining my glass.

""Careful,"" she warned, her tone dropping into that teasing register again, though the air between us felt suddenly charged. ""I might get jealous. Watching you two... it's hard not to want a piece of that for yourself.""

I laughed it off. I saw it as a compliment. I saw it as my beautiful, brilliant, perpetually single friend admiring the love I had found.

I didn't see the hunger.

I didn't see that when she said she wanted a piece of it, she wasn't speaking metaphorically.

""You'll find your Ethan,"" I assured her, reaching for the bill. ""He's out there.""

Sarah watched me, her head tilted to the side, her eyes assessing me like I was a puzzle she had already solved.

""Maybe,"" she said softly. ""Or maybe I just need to lower my standards. But it's hard to settle for a Honda when your best friend is driving a Ferrari.""

We walked out into the cool evening air, arm in arm. I felt buoyant, supported, loved. I had the man of my dreams waiting at home, and the best friend a woman could ask for by my side.

I didn't know that the third strand of the braid wasn't there to strengthen us.

It was there to strangle.

I've been single for a while, and while I'm comfortable on my own, I'd love to share my time and my life with the right person. In real life I'm shy, unfortunately, so meeting people is difficult for me. I'm hoping for a genuine connection that can grow into something romantic.

I'd love to meet someone local if possible.

I appreciate people who are thoughtful, curious, and introspective. I'm drawn to someone who is emotionally present, honest, kind, and consistent. No games, just adults being real with each other and treating each other well. I'm also comfortable with people who are wired a little differently. If you're autistic, ADHD, or otherwise neurodivergent, that wouldn't be a negative for me, and we might even understand each other better.

I try to eat healthy and stay fit, but I'm not obsessive about it. I'm a non-smoker and non-drinker, but coffee is absolutely my vice. I like dogs more than cats, although I do not have any pets myself and I am a night owl.

I love simple, low-key plans like weekend drives, museums, bookstores, thrift shops, quiet walks, coffee dates, farmers' markets, and staying in. I would also really enjoy meeting someone with a nerdy hobby or two, like ham radio, homelabbing, or maker-type projects.

I'd rather be home than go out. I love Criterion films and mellow jazz (Chet Baker, Coleman Hawkins, Bobby Hackett). I'm a big fan of cozy, candlelit evenings and that quiet lazy-afternoon feeling. I also enjoy learning new things and tinkering with tech. Peaceful days beat chaotic ones for me.

To be upfront, I am a transgender woman, and I would rather be clear about that from the beginning.

1qmcaiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dead_rose_04/comments/1qmcaiq/just_something_fictional/,Just something (Fictional),"So me, (23F), and my husband, (25M), have been together since high school. Long time, but also not. I have been watching him hide his phone more, spending less time with me, coming home late from work, when his job closes at 8pm. Okay that cool, he wants more hours and/or he’s at the bar. Fast forward to the other day while in was in the house, his phone goes off and he got a message from settings……. I already know that he’s hiding a girl like that. I wait a few minutes then grab his phone and run to my car. When I get in my car I locked the door and open his phone. His lock screen wasn’t a picture of him and I, and neither was his wallpaper. At this point I’m like whatever. I go to messages and see “settings”. I open up their messages and it goes back months. All the to the end of the year before. I’m furious. I take screenshots and send them all to my phone and then deleted all evidence that I was on his phone. Then go back inside and my husband is out the shower and looking around the living room. He asks, “have you seen my phone, I thought I had it in here.” I shrug and go into the bedroom and quickly put his phone on charge and tell him his phone is in here. He comes in grabs it and walks out like nothing happened. After looking through everything I found out it is a girl. Her name is Lauren, she’s 21, and works at the same office he does. Ofc it’s always the girls at work. I found her instagram and it’s look legit, until some of her older posts……. Translation surgery. She was he before…. And looks like she didn’t get that one thing removed…. Does he know..? I wondered. See I’m not against all that, but it’s just not my thing. After a few months past I see he still stays late and shit. I gave up on trying to get him to stay, if he wanted me he wouldn’t be running around. 

One day I come home and I see both of them on my couch, in my house mind you, and my husband shoot up and started panicking saying “it’s not what it looks like”. Ofc the classic line. I just roll my eyes and walk into the kitchen. After I few minutes I hear the door shut and he leaves with Lauren. While he is gone I pack all his shit up, and put it on the front porch. He’s come back around 7:30pm, it’s cold and raining now. He’s knocks on the door and I open it. He asks. “Why is all my stuff outside?” And I just smirk and say “maybe you should have told me you liked it in your ass before dating me.” He’s mouth drops and as he processing his I grab his keys and take off my house key and drops his keys on the floor. He still can’t pick his mouth up off the floor and I shut the door.

A year goes by, I have a new boyfriend and he has a little girl and she already calls me mommy 2.0. It’s so adorable. It’s a hot day in May, the little girl is outside playing in the front yard while I’m on the porch drinking my coffee and reading a book. A black car pulls up. Little girl up to the porch and hides behind my chair, she’s shy. I look up and my ex husband steps out the car. I thought to myself “what the actual fuck is he doing here?” He walks up to the porch and smiles and says hi. I just look at him and making sure he doesn’t mess with baby girl. He spots her. He asks, “did you have a kid already??” I roll my eyes and say “no, this is my boyfriend’s kid. She peeks over at him and hides again when they make eye contact. “Cute, anyways if I didn’t see her I would have asked if you wanted to get back together?” I laugh, like genuinely laugh at him. “Why would I get back together with you when you lied about Lauren. And then tried to say ‘it’s not what it looks like.’ When I already been know for months before hand that you was messing around with someone.In fact after researching her I found out she’s was trans and which is the response I gas you the night you left.” He says, “i figured out that and I also known I don’t like it in the booty and that’s the reason I came to ask for you back until I see that kid.” I say “well no, and get off my property before I call the police. He walks off and gets in his car and drives away. “Mommy 2.0, who is that guy?” Little girl asks. “Someone you will never have to worry about”, I say.

We’ve only hung out a handful of times, and I’m still feeling a bit unsure about the friendship because she’s very upfront very fast. For example, she once (jokingly?) asked me to break my lease and move in with her because she was having roommate problems, which I thought was a bit much given how new our friendship is. She also asks for favors fairly often (like asking me to pick up food and bring it to her), and while I try to be understanding because she’s having a hard time, it sometimes feels like a lot for how little time we’ve known each other.

On my birthday, I was feeling really depressed. Birthdays are hard for me in general, and I wasn’t planning on doing anything. She pushed me to at least go out for coffee and said she’d take me, so I reluctantly agreed.

When we got there, she ordered for herself and paid for her own drink, but not mine. I paid for myself. I know no one owes me anything, but the part that’s throwing me off is that she specifically framed it as “I’ll take you out for coffee for your birthday,” and I also didn’t even want to go in the first place. I’m also financially struggling and have been pretty open with her about that.

On top of that, the entire time we were there she mostly talked about her roommate drama.

I’m not mad exactly, but I feel weird and kind of uncomfortable about the whole interaction, and it’s adding to my uncertainty about the friendship. Am I overreacting for feeling put off by this, or is this a reasonable thing to be bothered by?",7,1769324941.0,AIO,7,1.0,False

1qmc8cm,https://i.redd.it/mys5f2tv2gfg1.png,I thought our marriage was perfect,"I thought our marriage was perfect until I found a protection in my husband's luggage before he went on a business trip.

I started pack his bag slowly once I heard the bathroom door close.



Then my hand brushed against something soft near the bottom of the bag.



My breath caught in my throat.



A protection.



Unused. Still sealed.



We didn't use protections.We hadn't in years.



I searched my mind desperately for explanations. Maybe it was old. Maybe it had been in his bag for years, and I had never noticed. Maybe he picked it up accidentally. Maybe it was some kind of free sample from a hotel.



Suddenly his phone on table buzzed.



The screen lit up.



Victoria.



""Can't wait to see you again. Don't let anyone know.""



That night, I didn't sleep.



I stared at the ceiling, replaying everything. The protection. The name. The way he avoided details.



By morning, one truth settled deep in my chest.



This wasn't suspicion anymore.



It was confirmation waiting for proof.



————————



Everyone said we had the perfect



marriage. Friends, family, colleagues, even strangers passing us at events-they all said the same thing. You could see it in their eyes. The kind of admiration that made me want to laugh because they had no idea. They only saw the surface. They didn't see the quiet compromises, the long nights waiting for him to come home, or the lonely mornings I spent making sure everything was perfect.



Ethan Parker. My husband. Perfect in public, untouchable, charming. Broad shoulders, suits that fit like they were made for him, a smile that could light up a room and hide whatever he wanted. He was respected, admired, and everyone thought he had it all together. And me? I was his obedient wife. The one who smiled when I was supposed to, the one who never interrupted him, the one who kept our life flawless on the surface.



But I knew better. I always had.



The morning started like any other. Sunlight poured through the floor-to-ceiling windows, painting gold across the living room. I had already been up for hours, arranging flowers on the counter, making myself tea, double-checking the itinerary for the charity gala this weekend. Ethan had left for the office early, as always, but I could still feel his absence, the subtle vibration of his world in ours.



I was tidying up the apartment, fluffing pillows, straightening the rugs, when his phone buzzed on the console table near the door. I didn't touch it, of course. But I saw it. The screen lit up with a message notification from an unknown number. I caught a glimpse of the words before he picked it up.



""Can't wait to see you tonight. Don't let anyone know.""



My chest tightened. I froze. It wasn't meant for me, I told myself. But I couldn't stop staring. He glanced at the message, smiled faintly, and quickly hid the screen from view as he slipped his phone back into his pocket. He left the apartment a few moments later, tie perfectly straight, briefcase in hand, still unaware or pretending not to notice-that I had seen the words.



The message didn't leave me alone all day. I went about my routines, trying to focus, but every detail reminded me of it. His rushed mornings, the way he avoided lingering on breakfast, the polite but distant smiles he always gave when I tried to catch his gaze. It was subtle, almost invisible to anyone else. But I could feel it.



By the time he returned that evening, my heart was in my throat. I had told myself I wouldn't confront him, that I would stay calm, that I would wait. But there was a tension I couldn't hide, not from myself.



He walked in carrying his briefcase and the faint scent of his cologne filled the apartment. ""Hey,"" he said, smiling at me as he dropped his bag on the floor. The smile was perfect, practiced, but there was something in his eyes that I had started to notice lately the flicker of hesitation, the tiny pause before he spoke.



""Hey,"" I said lightly, forcing the calm in my voice. ""Dinner will be ready in an hour. You have time to shower and change.""



""I'll be quick,"" he said, tossing the jacket over a chair, heading to the bathroom.



I followed him into the living room, pretending to read a magazine, though I didn't. My eyes were fixed on him. Every move, every gesture, I cataloged. He came back from the bathroom looking refreshed, hair perfectly styled, tie straightened again. He checked his phone briefly before tucking it away. I couldn't see the screen, but I could guess.



""You're quiet tonight,"" he said, breaking the silence.



""I'm just thinking,"" I replied lightly, forcing a smile. ""About life. About how easy it is to take things for granted.""



He gave a small, amused shrug. ""Philosophical, are we?""



I smiled again, though it didn't reach my eyes. ""Maybe,"" I said. ""Or maybe I'm just wondering how some people manage to look like they have everything while hiding the rest.""



He didn't answer, just sipped his wine, eyes on me for a brief second before looking away. I noticed the tension in his jaw, the quick glance at the clock. And then, as if on cue, his phone buzzed again. I pretended not to notice, but it was impossible to ignore. He glanced at it quickly, a flash of surprise or guilt-crossing his face, and then he hid it from view again.



Dinner arrived, and we sat down. I set the table with precision, making sure everything looked perfect the candles, the wine, the plates. I complimented him lightly on the table setting, made small talk, and laughed at the right moments. But inside, my thoughts were racing. Every vibration of his phone, every glance, every hesitation, I noticed.



""You've been distracted lately,"" I said casually. ""Everything okay at work?""



He smiled faintly, a little tight, and shook his head. ""Just busy,"" he said. ""Lots of meetings. Some clients are... demanding.""



I nodded. ""I understand. It's just that you seem... distant sometimes.""



""I'm fine,"" he said firmly. ""Just tired.""



We ate in polite silence after that. I kept the conversation light, talking about work events I had attended, the charity gala, Grace's plans for the weekend. He answered, smiled, occasionally laughing, but there was a gap I couldn't ignore. Something missing. I knew he was hiding more than just fatigue.



After dinner, he excused himself. ""I have a late meeting,"" he said, checking his watch. ""Shouldn't be long.""



I nodded, swallowing the knot in my throat. ""Of course.""



I watched him leave the apartment again, the same precise, confident walk, the same charming smile for anyone who might be watching. But I knew. I could feel it. There was someone else.



I couldn't explain how I knew so clearly. There were no confessions, no confrontations, no proof yet. Just pieces. A message that wasn't meant for me. His nervous glance at the phone. The way he laughed differently over calls when I wasn't in the room. How he avoided me in subtle ways, like he was protecting a secret.



And now, sitting alone in the quiet apartment, I felt it the first flicker of something I hadn't allowed myself to feel in years. Anger. Sharp and silent, settling deep in my bones. Not the screaming kind of anger, but the kind that sharpens your mind, that plans and calculates. The kind that makes you realize someone has crossed a line they will never be able to fix.



I poured myself a glass of wine, letting the rich liquid warm my hands. I replayed the morning, the messages, every gesture, every pause. And I knew. I didn't need confirmation. I didn't need proof beyond the obvious.



Ethan Parker had someone else.



It wasn't a question anymore. It was a fact.



I clenched my fists around the wine glass, knuckles whitening, and let myself breathe, steadying the storm inside. This wasn't the time to explode. Not yet. I had to be careful, smart. I had to watch, wait, and understand the full picture. The truth would come, and when it did, I had to be ready.



Because marriages survive betrayal sometimes.



But ours would not.



And I would make sure he understood that before the truth fully consumed him.



The house felt different when I woke up



the next morning.



Not quiet. Not empty. Just off.



Ethan was already gone. That wasn't unusual. He often left early for meetings or flights or site visits that came with his position. But usually there was a note. A text. Something small that said he had thought of me before leaving.



This time there was nothing.



I lay there for a long moment, staring at the ceiling, listening to the distant hum of the city outside our windows. My phone sat on the nightstand. No missed calls. No messages. Just silence.



I finally got out of bed and walked into the kitchen. The coffee machine was cold. His favorite mug was still in the cupboard. That meant he hadn't had coffee at home.



I told myself not to read into it.



Still, the feeling stayed.



I made my own coffee and sat at the island, scrolling through emails I didn't really need to answer yet. My mind kept drifting back to last night. The way he had looked distracted. The way his attention slipped away from me so easily, like I wasn't anchoring him anymore.



I hated that thought.



Around nine, my phone buzzed. Ethan's name flashed on the screen. My heart reacted before my mind could stop it.



""Hey,"" I answered.



""Morning,"" he said. His voice was smooth. Calm. Almost too calm. ""Did you sleep okay?""



""I did,"" I said. ""You left early.""



""Yeah. Early meeting."" A pause. ""I didn't want to wake you.""



That was thoughtful. Or it would have been, if it didn't feel rehearsed.



""What meeting?"" I asked casually.



""Potential investors. Nothing major."" Another pause. ""Listen, I might be tied up most of the day. Don't wait on me for lunch.""



""I wasn't planning to,"" I said, keeping my tone light.



""Good."" He hesitated. ""I'll call you later.""



""Okay.""



The call ended before I could say anything else.



I stared at my phone for a long second, then set it down. He used to talk more. About the meeting. About the people. About how his day would go. Lately, everything was vague.



I spent the late morning running errands. Grocery shopping. Picking up dry cleaning. Normal things. But even there, among strangers and shelves of neatly stacked produce, my thoughts followed him.



I found myself watching other couples. A man laughing with his wife near the bakery section. A woman leaning into her partner as they argued quietly about which cereal to buy. Real moments. Unfiltered.



When had Ethan and I stopped having those?



By early afternoon, I met Grace for lunch. She noticed it immediately.



""You're quiet,"" she said, setting her bag down across from me. ""That's not like you.""



""I'm tired,"" I said.



Grace raised an eyebrow. ""That's not it.""



I sighed and stirred my drink slowly. ""He's been distant.""



""How distant?"" she asked.



""He's here,"" I said. ""But not really.""



She leaned forward. ""Talk to me.""



""I don't know how to explain it without sounding paranoid,"" I admitted. ""It's just little things. Short answers. Less eye contact. His phone is always face down now. And when it vibrates, he stiffens.""



Grace didn't interrupt. She just listened.



""I asked him about his day yesterday,"" I continued. ""He answered, but it felt like he was choosing every word carefully. Like he was afraid of saying the wrong thing.""



""That's not nothing,"" Grace said quietly.



""I know."" I exhaled. ""But it's not enough to accuse him of anything either.""



""So don't,"" she said. ""Not yet.""



""What if I'm wrong?""



""Then observing won't hurt anyone,"" she said. ""But confronting without proof will.""



I nodded. That was what I needed to hear.



When I got home later, Ethan still wasn't there. I changed into comfortable clothes and moved around the apartment, straightening things that didn't need fixing. His office door was closed. That was new.



I stood there for a moment, my hand hovering near the handle.



I didn't open it.



Instead, I went into the kitchen and started preparing dinner. Cooking always grounded me. The rhythm. The familiarity. I needed something steady.



Ethan walked in around seven.



""Hey,"" he said, loosening his tie.



""Hey,"" I replied. ""Long day?""



""Yeah. Exhausting."" He glanced at the stove. ""Smells good.""



""Sit,"" I said. ""Dinner's almost ready.""



He did, scrolling through his phone while I plated the food. I watched him from the corner of my eye. His thumb moved quickly. He smiled at something on the screen, then caught himself and wiped the expression away.



I set his plate down a little harder than necessary.



""You okay?"" he asked.



""Fine,"" I said. ""Just tired.""



He nodded. ""Me too.""



We ate in silence for a few minutes.



""So,"" I said finally, ""investors went well?""



""Yes,"" he said. Too fast. ""Productive.""



""Anyone I know?""



""No.""



That was it. No names. No stories.



I tried again. ""You're traveling next week, right?""



""Yes.""



""Where?""



He paused. Just for a second. ""Chicago.""



""You didn't mention that before.""



""It was finalized late.""



I nodded slowly. ""How long?""



""Two nights.""



I didn't say anything else. I didn't need to. His shoulders were tense now. His answers clipped.



After dinner, he stood. ""I have some emails to catch up on.""



""In your office?"" I asked.



""Yes.""



""Okay.""



He hesitated, then leaned down and bussed my forehead. ""Don't wait up.""



I watched him walk away, his back straight, his steps measured.



I sat there alone at the table long after he disappeared behind the closed door.



Something had shifted.



Not dramatically. Not loudly.



But enough that I couldn't pretend anymore.



That night, lying beside him in bed, I stared into the dark while he slept. Or pretended to. His breathing was even, but there was tension in his body, like he wasn't fully at rest.



I wondered who occupied his thoughts when he closed his eyes.



I wondered when I stopped being the first person he wanted to talk to.



I didn't cry.



I didn't confront him.



I just listened to my instincts, finally allowing them to speak.



And they were telling me one thing very clearly.



Something was coming.



And when it did, nothing about our marriage would ever be the same again.



Ethan came back from Chicago on a



Thursday evening.



I knew the exact time his flight landed because I had checked it twice. Not because I didn't trust him, I told myself, but because it was a habit. A wife thing. You track arrivals. You plan dinners. You make space for someone coming home.



Still, when I heard the lock turn and the door open, my heart jumped in a way it hadn't before.



""You're back,"" I said as I stepped out of the kitchen.



""Yeah,"" he replied, rolling his suitcase in behind him. ""Early landing.""



He looked tired. Travel tired. His shoulders were slumped, his shirt wrinkled, the sharpness he usually carried dulled by exhaustion. If someone had asked me at that moment, I would have said he looked like a man who had worked too hard.



If they asked me now, I would say he looked like a man coming back from somewhere he didn't want to leave.



""How was Chicago?"" I asked.



""Busy,"" he said, loosening his collar. ""Meetings all day. Dinner meetings, too.""



""You didn't call last night,"" I said quietly.



He paused for a second, then shrugged. ""It got late. I didn't want to wake you.""



""I was awake,"" I replied.



He smiled, but it didn't quite reach his eyes. ""I'll make it up to you.""



I nodded and stepped aside as he walked toward the bedroom.



""I'll unpack,"" I said. ""Go shower.""



""You don't have to,"" he replied.



""I want to.""



That was true. Or at least, it used to be.



I followed his suitcase into the bedroom once I heard the bathroom door close and the shower started running. The sound of water filled the apartment, steady and loud enough to drown out my thoughts if I let it.



I unzipped his bag slowly.



Everything looked normal at first. Suits folded neatly. Shirts pressed. Shoes lined up along the side. His toiletries tucked into the outer pocket. It was exactly how Ethan packed. Precise. Organized. Controlled.



Then my hand brushed against something soft near the bottom of the bag.



I frowned and pushed aside a shirt.



There it was.



A small silver pack.



My breath caught in my throat.



I stared at it for a long moment, my brain refusing to process what my eyes were seeing. I picked it up slowly, like it might burn me.



A protection.



Unused. Still sealed.



I sat down on the edge of the bed, the packet resting in my palm. My heart started pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears.



We didn't use protections.



We hadn't in years.



I searched my mind desperately for explanations. Maybe it was old. Maybe it had been in his bag for years, and I had never noticed. Maybe he picked it up accidentally. Maybe it was some kind of free sample from a hotel.



But I knew my husband.



Ethan didn't carry things he didn't need. He didn't forget things like this. He didn't pack carelessly.



And he definitely didn't travel with protections unless he planned to use them.



My hands started to shake.



I looked toward the bathroom door, half expecting him to walk out and catch me holding it. The water continued to run.



I forced myself to breathe.



Slowly, carefully, I placed the protection back exactly where I found it. I folded the clothes over it. Zipped the bag closed.



There is no evidence of disturbance.



My reflection in the mirror looked pale. Older. Like something had been drained from me without my permission.



When Ethan came out of the bathroom, steam clinging to his skin, I was sitting on the bed scrolling through my phone like nothing had happened.



""Hey,"" he said. ""You okay?""



""Yeah,"" I replied. ""Just tired.""



He leaned down and bussed my forehead. ""Thanks for unpacking.""



""You're welcome.""



We had dinner together. I cooked. He ate. We talked about small things. The weather. A project he might take on next month. A mutual friend's upcoming event.



I answered when expected. Smiled when necessary.



Inside, everything was screaming.



After dinner, he said he wanted to shower again and sleep early. I nodded and went to the bedroom to change.



His phone was on the nightstand.



Face up.



I told myself not to look at it.



I sat on my side of the bed and picked up a book, trying to focus. I read the same sentence over and over, my eyes moving but my mind elsewhere.



Then his phone buzzed.



Once.



The screen lit up briefly, then went dark.



I didn't move.



I told myself it was nothing.



It buzzed again.



This time, my eyes betrayed me.



The screen lit up, and I saw the name.



Victoria.



My chest tightened.



That was all. Just the name. No message preview. No explanation.



I felt numb, like my body had gone quiet while my mind stayed alert.



When Ethan walked back into the room, he noticed my stillness immediately.



""You look lost,"" he said lightly.



""I was thinking,"" I replied.



He reached for his phone, glanced at the screen, and his jaw tightened just slightly before he masked it.



""Everything okay?"" I asked.



""Yeah,"" he said too quickly. ""Work stuff.""



""At this hour?""



""Different time zone.""



I looked at him. Really looked.



""Who's Victoria?""



He paused.



""A colleague,"" he said. ""From Chicago.""



""What does she do?"" I asked.



""Marketing.""



I nodded slowly. ""You didn't mention working with marketing.""



""It's new.""



""Is she new too?""



""Yes.""



Another pause.



""You've been busy lately,"" I said quietly.



He sighed. ""Olivia, you're reading too much into things.""



""Am I?"" I asked.



""Yes,"" he said firmly. ""You always do when you're anxious.""



That hurt more than the lie.



He climbed into bed beside me and reached for my hand. I let him hold it, though it felt like my body belonged to someone else now.



That night, I didn't sleep.



I stared at the ceiling, replaying everything. The protection. The name. The way his voice changed. The way he avoided details.



By morning, one truth settled deep in my chest.



This wasn't suspicion anymore.



It was confirmation waiting for proof.



And whatever Ethan brought back from Chicago, it wasn't just work.

""Y-your brothers have come to... to withdraw you. They're taking you home.""

Home. The word echoes, hollow and wrong.

I don't have a home. Not anymore.

I turn. And the world drops out from under me.

Lorenzo stands against the back wall. Unmoving. Watchful. Older. Harder.

Vincenzo beside him, eyes sharp and assessing.

My brothers. Here.

""Hi, Gianna.""

The sound of my name on his lips almost cracks something open.

Every ounce of anger I've carried for five years coils tight in my chest.

""Dad will explain everything when we get home.""

Dad.

The word lands wrong. Heavy. Foreign.

And then I say the one thing he clearly isn't prepared for.

""I don't have a father anymore.""

The words come out cold. Devoid of emotion. Like facts read off a page.

""You all stopped being my family five years ago. When you shipped me to another country. Changed my name. Exiled me.""

The girl they abandoned is dust. What stands before them now does not bend. Does not beg. Does not forget. And she's only just started collecting what they owe her.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Gianna Pov

My family sucks.

At this point, I don't know why I ever let myself have even the smallest shred of hope that they might change.

It's been like this for five years now.

Ever since they wrote me off. Believed a lie because it was easier than believing me.

Pricks.

My life really is like a Disney movie-if you strip out all the magic and replace it with trauma.

I'm the fat, ugly duckling with an evil twin sister. Cast aside. Exiled. Sent away to live in a tower.

Except it's not a tower.

It's a strict-as-sin all-girls reform school in the middle of Germany.

And somehow? I run this bimbo.

There's no loving family waiting for my safe return. No lanterns lighting the way home like Rapunzel. Just a family that wishes I were dead.

And honestly? The feeling's mutual.

Because when that tiny seed of hope gets shoved down-way, way, way deep-all that's left is hatred.

If this were really a Disney movie, I would've been rescued by now. Swept away by some hot prince with a thick accent and a savior complex.

But I'm not a damsel.

And I don't need saving.

All I need... is me.

The one time in the last five years I let myself trust someone, he did exactly what everyone else in my miserable life has done.

He left me broken.

Never again.

The blankets rustle as I pull them tighter around my shoulders, curling deeper into bed as the digital clock glows in the darkness of my cell-

I mean... tower.

Room.

12:02 a.m.

It's officially my seventeenth birthday.

And my father couldn't even be bothered to call.

I know, I know-you're probably thinking relax, you crazy bimbo, it's only two minutes past midnight.

But back when I still had a family-back when I was stupid enough to believe I mattered-my father never missed it. Not once.

Every year, without fail, he'd come into my sister's and my shared bedroom... or call right at twelve on the dot. Just so he could be the first to say it.

Happy birthday.

""Happy birthday to me,"" I whisper, crushing every emotion that tries to claw its way to the surface.

Five years.

No phone calls.

No holidays.

No birthdays.

No visits.

Nothing.

They don't deserve a place in my life.

And they sure as sin don't deserve a place in my heart.

They wouldn't recognize me now-even if they tried.

Rolling onto my side, I force myself to breathe in... and out.

Just like he taught me.

Then I let the nightmares take me

\*

The sound of violent banging rips me out of sleep.

I jerk, heart racing, eyes struggling to focus as pale morning light spills through the tall, narrow windows of my room. For a second, I don't know where I am-or who I'm supposed to be today.

Then reality slams back into place.

""What time is it...?""

I squint at the digital clock glowing on my nightstand.

10:00.

""Oh-shiit.""

I bolt upright.

""Sh.it, sh.it, sh.it.""

I forgot to turn on my alarm.

They are going to kill me.

I'm out of bed in seconds, dragging open drawers, yanking on the stiff gray uniform skirt and blouse the school insists we wear on transport days. I barely bother buttoning it properly, hands shaking as I shove my feet into shoes.

At the last second, I grab my bag and stuff a pair of worn jeans and a black top inside.

I'm not spending the entire day dressed like a sanctioned ghost.

I rake my fingers through my hair, not even pretending to tame it, and fling my door open-

\-and narrowly avoid getting punched in the face.

Annalese freezes mid-swing, eyes wide. ""sorry, Gia!""

""Come on!"" I snap, grabbing her wrist before she can even apologize again.

I drag her down the narrow spiral staircase of my tower, boots pounding against stone steps worn smooth by years of isolation and punishment masquerading as concern.

Yes. A tower.

I wasn't being dramatic last night.

Apparently, my family-and the administration-decided I'm too unstable to live with the other girls. Easier to keep me separate. Easier to keep me quiet. Easier to pretend I'm not here.

We take the stairs two at a time, nearly tripping as we burst onto the main landing and sprint toward the front of the school.

""NO RUNNING!"" the janitor shouts after us, shaking her mop like it's a weapon.

We don't even slow down.

I nearly double over laughing when I spot Isa at the transport doors, bent in half, clutching her stomach like she's in the middle of a medical emergency.

She's committed. I'll give her that.

""Miss Valen,"" the driver says flatly, arms crossed. ""We need to leave. Either get on the bus or go to medical.""

""Y-yeah, I will,"" Isa groans dramatically. ""I just-ahhh-oh my God-""

She squeezes her eyes shut, swaying.

Then she peeks between her lashes, spots us flying toward her from the left, and straightens instantly.

""Oh! Wow,"" she says, brushing imaginary dust off her skirt. ""Must've been the last cramp. I feel so much better.""

The driver just sighs, clearly aware but choosing peace, as Annalese and I pile onto the bus behind her, breathless, laughing, and barely avoiding consequences-again.

We collapse into the back row of the transport bus like we've just escaped a war zone.

Isa drops into the seat first, cheeks flushed, arms crossed tight over her chest. Annalese slides in beside her, smoothing her skirt, still breathing a little too fast. I take the window, clutching my bag like it's the only thing tethering me to sanity.

The doors hiss shut.

The bus lurches forward.

Only then does Isa groan and drag her hands down her face.

""I cannot believe I just did that.""

I snort. ""You were convincing.""

She shoots me a glare. ""I faked period cramps in front of a grown adult with a clipboard, Gia. That's a new low.""

Annalese laughs softly. ""You did save us, though.""

Isa sighs, shoulders slumping. ""Yeah, well. Still humiliating.""

The bus rattles as the gates slide open, the stone walls of the school slowly falling away behind us. I lean my forehead against the cool glass, watching the towers disappear.

Once a week.

That's all we get.

One transport out. One transport back.

Miss the bus going out? Too bad-there's always next week.

Miss the one coming back?

You lose the privilege entirely.

It took me two years before they let me leave.

Two years of ""good behavior.""

Two years of no incidents.

I was a different girl then.

""So,"" Annalese says gently, breaking the silence. ""We still going to Steiger's ?""

I turn, a slow smile curling at the corner of my mouth. ""Of course.""

Isa rolls her eyes. ""Of course.""

""I've got training,"" I add casually. ""And Jonas texted me last night ago, jonas said I have a fight on the books at three.

""Isa groans. ""You are unhinged.""

Annalese bites her lip, worried. ""Do you have to?""

I glance at her, softening. ""I don't have to. I want to.""

Steiger's isn't just a place-it's survival.

It's a local fight venue tucked beneath an old warehouse, the kind of place people from the underworld gravitate toward when they're in town. No cameras. No questions. Cash only.

The first time I came here, I was fifteen.

Unhealthy. Weak. Angry.

Part of it was depression.

The other part?

I really, really love food-and eating my feelings.

I'd wandered too far from the market, distracted, tired. Cornered. Two men. I didn't know how to fight. Didn't know how to scream loud enough.

Jonas-the owner-and his son, Henry, stepped in before it got worse.

After that, once a week, I was there.

Training. Fighting. Learning discipline.

They gave me structure.

A routine I could keep-even back at the school.

And slowly... everything changed.

Mentally.

Physically.

Emotionally.

Mostly.

Annalese glances at my bag. ""Are we changing before we get there?""

I smirk, tapping it with my foot. ""Of course. I am not walking around the village looking like a haunted schoolgirl all day.""

Isa snorts despite herself. ""Good. Because you look like a ghost that escaped a convent.""

The bus hums beneath us, carrying us farther from the school, closer to freedom.

Just for today.

\*

The bus slows as the road narrows, cobblestone rattling beneath the tires.

The village comes into view like something stolen from a postcard-stone buildings clustered together, narrow streets, little shops just waking up. A bakery with its windows fogged from heat. A cafe dragging chairs outside. Normal life.

Freedom.

The bus hisses as it comes to a stop in the small gravel lot just outside the village center.

No one moves.

We all know better.

The aisle creaks as Frau Keller stands.

A collective, silent groan ripples through the bus.

She's tall, stiff-backed, dressed in gray like she was born offended by color. Her lips press together as she surveys us, eyes sharp and disapproving-like she already knows we're planning crimes.

She hates us.

We hate her.

It's mutual. Efficient.

""Before anyone exits,"" she says sharply, her accent slicing through the bus, ""we will go over the rules. Again.""

Isa mutters under her breath, ""Thrilling.""

I elbow her lightly.

Frau Keller's gaze snaps in our direction, but she continues.

""You are here on privilege, not right. One day. One outing."" She lifts a finger. ""You will stay within the village boundaries. You will not enter restricted establishments. You will not start fights, steal, disappear, or embarrass this institution.""

Her eyes linger on me for half a second too long.

Shocker.

""You will return to this bus by 6 o'clock sharp,"" she continues. ""Not six -oh-one. Not six-oh-two. Late arrivals will lose village privileges indefinitely.""

A pause.

""If you miss the return transport,"" she says coolly, ""you will not be allowed to leave again. Ever.""

The air tightens.

Everyone here knows that rule.

It took me two years before I was trusted enough to sit on this bus. Two years of swallowed rage. Of silence. Of proving I wasn't the girl they decided I was.

I was a different girl then.

Frau Keller folds her hands. ""You will be searched upon return. Any contraband will result in punishment.""

She steps aside and gestures toward the door.

""You may go.""

For a split second, no one moves.

Then the doors open with a hydraulic sigh, and the spell breaks.

Girls pour out in clusters, laughter bursting free the moment their feet hit the ground. Voices rise. Shoulders straighten. Smiles bloom like they've been starved for sunlight.

Annalese exhales, almost reverent. ""I forgot how good it smells out here.""

Isa cracks her neck. ""That's called freedom.""

I step down last, the village air cool against my skin, my bag slung over my shoulder-jeans and a black top waiting inside like a promise.

Frau Keller watches us from the bus steps, arms crossed, eyes already counting the hours until she gets us back.

I don't look at her.

I look forward.

My knuckles already tingling with anticipation, today of all days I need a release.

\*

Steiger's sits at the edge of the village where the streets narrow and the buildings lean closer together, brick darkened by age and secrets. No sign. No windows. Just a heavy metal door tucked beneath a faded warehouse awning like it doesn't want to be found.

The kind of place you only notice if you're looking for it.

Annalese slows beside me, fingers tightening around the strap of her bag.

""This is where I peel off,"" she says quietly.

Isa snorts. ""You sure? You could watch Gia rearrange someone's face.""

Annalese wrinkles her nose, though she smiles. ""I'll pass. It's... loud. And rough. And it smells like blood and regret.""

I smirk. ""That's part of the charm.""

She bumps her shoulder lightly against mine. ""I know it is. Just not for me.""

Her gaze flicks to the door-steel, scarred, uninviting-then back to me, worry softening her eyes. ""You'll be careful?""

""Always,"" I say automatically.

She doesn't look convinced.

""There's a little bookstore near the square,"" she adds. ""The one with the blue shutters. I want to check if they have anything in English.""

""Of course you do,"" Isa says, rolling her eyes fondly. ""Text us if you find something depressing.""

Annalese laughs. ""I will.""

She hesitates, then steps forward and wraps her arms around me in a quick, tight hug. She smells like soap and paper and something gentle that doesn't belong near places like this.

""Seven o'clock,"" she reminds me softly. ""Don't be late.""

""I won't,"" I promise.

She pulls back, gives Isa a small wave, then turns and heads back toward the brighter streets of the village, her figure slowly swallowed by sunlight and quiet.

Isa watches her go, then clicks her tongue. ""Smart one, that girl.""

""She is,"" I agree.

Isa grins at me, sharp and unapologetic. ""Ready to make bad decisions?""

I glance at the door.

At the place that saved me.

""Always.""

I knock once.

The door swings open, and the noise hits like a punch-music, shouts, metal on metal, the roar of bodies colliding. Heat. Sweat. Electricity.

And just like that...

I'm home.

Alessia Pov

Sunlight spills through the sheer curtains, warm and indulgent, brushing over silk sheets and expensive furniture like it knows exactly where it belongs.

I stretch slowly, luxuriating in the space around me.

My room is beautiful-high ceilings, pale walls, a crystal chandelier that catches the light just right. Everything curated. Everything perfect. Just like it should be.

I smile to myself as I sit up.

It's my birthday.

Seventeen.

The thought makes a soft laugh slip from my lips. Excited? Of course I am. The entire day will be about me-gifts, attention, admiration.

Then again... when isn't it?

""Please,"" I murmur to my reflection in the darkened window. ""Every day is about me.""

I slide out of bed and move toward the bathroom, bare feet sinking into plush carpet. My routine is practiced, flawless-cleansed skin, soft makeup, just enough to look effortless while still being devastating.

When I return to my room, I choose the dress I laid out the night before. Short. Structured. Preppy in the way that makes people think good girl when they should know better. Heels click softly as I step into them, grounding me.

I stop in front of the mirror.

Perfect.

My hair falls in loose waves down my back, my waist narrow, my legs long and toned. I turn slightly, inspecting every angle, every line. There's satisfaction there-deep and unquestioned.

This is what they see.

This is what they chose.

My smile sharpens as an unwanted thought flickers through my mind.

My twin.

The corner of my mouth twitches.

God, it's almost funny.

I picture her the way she was the last time I saw her-soft, round, always taking up too much space. Always eating. Always looking like she wanted something she couldn't have.

The fat sister.

The embarrassing one.

The one who ruined everything just by existing.

I tilt my head, studying my reflection again, reassured by the contrast. By the distance. By how thoroughly that chapter of my life has been erased.

She's gone.

And I'm still here.

I smooth my dress, lift my chin, and smile at myself-wide, bright, practiced.

Seventeen looks good on me.

I hear them before I see them.

Voices drift up the hall as I move toward the dining room, overlapping, amused, competitive.

""I'm telling you, she'll like mine more.""

""You bought her jewelry again. She already has too much.""

""She doesn't have this.""

I slow my steps just outside the doorway, smiling to myself.

Of course they're arguing.

Every year, it's the same-my brothers circling, posturing, desperate to be the one who pleases me most. Gifts wrapped perfectly. Attention lavished freely.

They've always been like this.

Wrapped around my finger.

Every single one of them.

Even my father.

I step into the room.

The argument stops instantly.

Six heads turn. Smiles spread. Chairs shift. The energy changes, bending toward me like gravity has rules only I get to break.

""There she is,"" Marco says, grinning. ""Birthday girl.""

""Finally decided to join us,"" Enzo adds. ""We were about to start without you.""

I laugh lightly, letting the sound carry just enough sweetness. ""You wouldn't dare.""

My father sits at the head of the table, as he always does-posture immaculate, expression warm in a way he saves only for moments like this. He looks up when he sees me, pride unmistakable in his eyes.

""Buon compleanno, Alessia,"" he says. ""Seventeen.""

I walk toward him, heels clicking softly against marble, and lean down to [ki.ss](http://ki.ss) his cheek. ""Thank you, Papa.""

I feel it then-the familiar sense of triumph. Of safety. Of knowing exactly where I stand.

Loved. Chosen.

It had been almost too easy five years ago.

The lie, I mean.

I'd been close to Lorenzo then. Close enough to know how to shape it. Close enough to know what would sound believable. And really-who wouldn't believe me?

I'd been the good one. The perfect one. The daughter who never caused trouble.

The truth never stood a chance.

""Sit,"" my father says gently, gesturing toward my place. ""Breakfast first.""

A chorus of groans answers him.

""Presents,"" Nico protests. ""Come on, Papa.""

""Yes, presents,"" Elio adds. ""It's cruel to make her wait.""

My father lifts a brow, amused but firm. ""Breakfast. Then gifts. I want to watch you all behave like civilized men for at least ten minutes.""

They grumble but obey.

I take my seat, smoothing my dress, basking in the attention as plates are passed and coffee poured. My brothers watch me like I might disappear if they look away.

All of them-except one.

Lorenzo sits a few seats down, expression unreadable, posture rigid. He meets my gaze briefly.

""Happy birthday,"" he says.

Nothing more. No smile. No warmth.

Just obligation.

It annoys me more than it should.

He had been the closest to her once.

I look away first.

Food is served. Forks clink. Conversation resumes, light and loud and full of me.

Recently she attended a interview in Isa Town ( not naming that creep) the role was to be assistant to the director.

Prior to interview they send questions to fill and ask feedback on one of their projects etc. she did all that and went for interview.

Interview was in evening at 6.30pm. Once started the guy became flirty. His demands are they have to travel together and stay together, also he is becoming touchy and flirty. 

Its common for PA to travel with boss and its understandable. But she said she’s not like the way he approach as she feels it insecure. The creep replied no one will rape u here in Bahrain, we do that only we both like it! He also wants a hug at the end of the interview and followed by a coffee date to discuss further. Im not listening everything happened there but i felt anger for such poor women of ours.

She states its not her first encounter such behaviors and they tend to cop with it or those who has dignity will deny. 

Its a shame how this people take advantage of job seeking women and ruin their mental strength.

He's tall and tattooed with long dark hair and startling green eyes - everything I never knew I wanted - and he's looking in my direction.

Jade



It's another beautiful, sunny morning in my newly adopted home town of Sapphire Lake. Late start, as seems to be customary around these parts, coffee at the cheery little coffee shop just opened in the centre of town while people watching from one of three tables on the side walk as I face time the kids back home.



The kids of course aren't exactly little. We're talking 23 and 20 here, but they will always be 'the kids' with all the connotations that come with that. I'm listening to my eldest tell tales of his adventures with the local senior sergeant while lamenting the fact that his V8 ute now sounds like an electric car - all in the name of keeping his licence. He's swearing, I'm laughing and we're enjoying the catch up. Maybe we're enjoying it too much because as I look up and try to wipe the tears of laughter from my eyes I notice the two men at the table next to me raise their eyebrows in my direction as they enjoy their coffees. They both appear to be very tall (at least from where I sit), built like the proverbial brick trash house and to top it off, handsome as they come. I'm not sure if they're smirking at me but I can't help but notice the intense green eyes of the one on the left. This man is a knockout with long, thick wavy brown hair streaked here and there with grey, shaved at the sides and loosely braided over the top, two day's growth neatly trimmed and his very green eyes appear to be laughing at me. I'm sure I've seen him somewhere around town before, he's hard to miss. The guy on the right is massive. He's inches taller than green eyes with a long greying beard and very little hair - maybe a number one all over - and piercing brown eyes. And I'm not sure how that chair is supporting him. They're both wearing leather cuts emblazoned with He-ll's Keepers in red lettering, the name of the MC they're members of. So far, none of them have given me any cause for alarm but it's something that I store away for more thought later.



I look away quickly to salvage what is left of my dignity and go back to chatting. I try to keep it quiet but fail miserably and end up in exactly the same predicament a second time suffering under the very intense stare of a very handsome man. That's my cue to leave so I drain the last of my coffee and walk away still chatting to Axel so I don't have to offer any kind of explanation and suffer any further embarrassment. And as I walk away - with a little swing in my hips, I get the distinct feeling those green eyes are still watching. And if I'm being totally honest about it, I'm not entirely disappointed and maybe, secretly kind of pleased. It's been two years since I felt the touch of a man and I missed it. Calloused hands on soft skin, warm breath on my neck, hands in my hair. This longing is not new to me but this feeling I'm having about tall dark and handsome over there, well that is a surprise and maybe cause for alarm and again, something else to be stored away for later.



I have my ear buds in and am enjoying the home grown music on my Spotify play list as I head home. Two long blocks down I make a left and head down the hill towards the lake another four blocks away. It's a spectacular day with the sunlight dancing on the sapphire blue water of the lake in the distance and a slight breeze playing with the trees overhead. And then my world turns upside down - enter the Mack truck.



A small delivery truck is turning out of the street just in front of me but has failed to notice the young guy on a Harley in his path. He doesn't even slow down and ploughs straight into the bike. The bike is pushed 50 metres down the road with the rider half hanging on, his leg appearing to be caught under the bike which is now on its side. The truck is forced off course, missing the other vehicles and pedestrians which thankfully are few today and smashes into a large oak tree on the other side of the road.



My heartbeat ramps up, my brain freezes and I lose focus almost blacking out. My feet thankfully have a mind of their own and make a beeline for the guy on the bike. I'm screaming at two elderly pedestrians to call triple zero but my brain can't seem to process why they're not following orders. After giving me several strange looks, they do however pull out a phone and start to dial. Hopefully they're calling for help.



As I fall to my knees next to the injured rider, I see a pool of blood under his body. From what I can tell, it looks to be coming from the leg stuck under the bike and it occurs to me that he may have a severed artery in his leg. From here on in, thought disappears and instinct takes over. I'm not wearing jeans so have no belt. Instead I take off the light jumper I'm wearing and force it under his leg at the top of his thigh and tie the sleeves together as tight as I can, trying to stem the bleeding. The bike is too heavy for me to lift so I look around for help. Two young men are running towards me from the hardware store and between them, manage to lift the bike off the guy on the road and we manage to roll him gently onto his back. There's nothing more to be done until help arrives so I sit there quietly holding his bloodied hand which has been torn to shreds from the slide and stroking his forehead which is also in a bad way. Actually, most of him is in a bad way. An impact and a slide like that does a lot of damage. He does not seem to be at all alert but only whimpers occasionally as I reassure him the ambos are on the way. All the while, my mind is drawn back to the events of two years ago...



A knock at the door at 3pm on a Sunday is unusual to say the least and as I get up off the couch and grumble my way to the front door, I'm silently praying that it's not some idiot trying to sell me something. Disturbing my couch time can't possibly end well for them. However as I open the door to two police officers, I realise it's my day that may not end so well. I barely register their names or faces as they apologise, their faces downcast, as they try to explain that my husband has been in a motorcycle accident. What I didn't hear as I tried to reach for my wallet and keys to rush to the hospital was that he had been killed in a motorcycle accident. ""There's no need to rush Mrs Black. You don't need to identify him right now. Is there someone we can call for you?""



Eventually help arrives and I drag myself back to the present. It probably took all of three minutes but felt like an eternity. An eternity. I never thought I would have to visit again. But as my hand is pried from the injured man's and I watch the paramedics assess him and move the rider to the trolley, I see the rise and fall of his chest and I know that even though his breathing is shallow, he's still alive. It would seem that for the moment, I've managed to put the brakes on that Mack truck.



I remain where I am, not entirely present, until a face appears right in front of me. The owner of the face is wearing a uniform and appears vaguely familiar. He's talking at me but I can't hear him. Eventually he moves behind me, lifts me up and moves me off the road to a bench at the bus stop. He just sits beside me patting my shoulder and holding my hand till eventually I come back and I am looking into the concerned face of the local sheriff. ""Are you alright miss? Do you need to go to hospital? You've had quite a shock.""



I wave off his questions and indicate that I just want to sit where I am for a few minutes. In front of me the accident site is being cordoned off and a few onlookers moved on. I register sirens in the background and another very loud sound. Bikes, loud and more than one and moving quickly but I can't see any of these things. I'm trying just to focus on the voice next to me. The sheriff is offering me a ride home which I gratefully accept. It's not far to walk but today, I'm not sure I can make it.



The car pulls up at the front of my small rented cabin which sits across from Lake Sapphire. I'm not sure how we got here. I don't recall speaking my address. Either I pointed the way home or the town's well-oiled rumour mill has already let the sheriff know where the Aussie lives. More likely the latter but right now I don't care. The sheriff takes my keys from my hand and guides me inside sitting me on the couch and heading to my kitchen. I hear the kettle boiling and he's offering to make me a coffee.



""Tea please. White with two...please."" I mumble.



He appears shortly with a cup of tea and sits opposite me and as he asks again if I'm ok and I re-live my personal inferno for the second time today. I've no idea how much detail I give him but his face registers shock and distress before he moves beside me and again pats my shoulder and holds my hand.



""I'm so sorry you had to see that accident today Mrs Black. But I've got to say, it's lucky for the rider that you did. That tourniquet you applied may have just saved his life and he was really clinging to the comfort you offered. He did not want to let go of your hand.""



""Will you be ok if I leave you now? I need to get back to supervise the accident scene and the clean-up.""



""I'll be fine. Thank you for bringing me home."" I mutter. I don't think I even managed to see him out before I pass out on the couch.

Dublin



Dublin stood at the door of the bar looking out over the sparkling lake and thinking he had the best workplace in the world. Seriously, what could be better than a bar that sat lakeside with its own jetty and his own apartment, complete with a view, upstairs? It may not be the fanciest bar in town or have the flashiest clientele but it was an easy place to be and had the best location on earth. And he'd seen plenty of this earth. In his opinion, this was the best place on it and he planned to live out the rest of his days right in this spot. Which is why he had taken the time to prospect for the He-ll's Keepers MC. They were the family he had never had and desperately wanted. As a patched member, he knew without a shadow of doubt that they had his back as much as he had theirs. They were loyal beyond anything he had ever known and didn't care about his past.



As he sipped on his coffee, the unmistakeable sound of a Harley disturbed his reverie. He watched the rider dismount and saunter up the ramp to join him.



""Morning Dublin""



""Morning Saint...you're up and about early for a good for nothing biker"" he said with a grin on his face. ""Aren't you supposed to sleep until lunchtime?""



""Rough night. Spent the whole night at the hospital with Reign. Heading home now. Got any more of that coffee...and a shot?""



""Absolutely brother. Follow me inside. He's gonna be okay though yeah? Need anything else?""



""Just the coffee and shot. Let me know if you hear anything else about it. I want to know what happened and I'm pretty sure Sheriff ain't gonna tell me trash. Kid's gonna be ok but he'll be laid up for a while. Can't say the same for his bike though. It's been totalled.""



""Oh! The kid worked so hard on that too. At least he's still with us though. Sounds like it could have been a different story. Will let you know what I hear. Bound to be some kind of gossip coming through these doors.""



The two men sat outside soaking up the late morning sun together staring wordlessly at the lake and sipping coffee. After 15 minutes of silent contemplation, Saint stood to take his leave. ""Gotta go get some sleep and then head back to the hospital. Thanks for the coffee brother. See you soon"". He steered his large frame back down the ramp to the street staring at the lake and giving Dublin a two fingered wave over his shoulder. In the distance he saw what appeared to be a child standing on a surfboard?? Paddling towards the bar. ""What?"" He straddled his bike but continued to stare, fascinated and confused, at the figure on the lake. Judging by its shapely curves, it was definitely NOT a child and it definitely WAS a woman...a small, curvy woman with long dark hair who was making his day brighter by the second. She also looked suspiciously like the woman he got caught watching at the coffee shop yesterday - twice. It had been years since someone had piqued his interest like that. She was paddling towards the jetty and Dublin and moving remarkably fast. He stared for another thirty seconds and decided he'd speak to Dublin about her later. The bike roared to life beneath him and he took off up the avenue with a smile on his face for the first time in 24 hours, ready for some sweet dreams.



Jade pulled alongside the jetty and threw a thin rope to Dublin so her stand up paddleboard wouldn't float away. He smiled in return and offered her a hand up to the jetty. This woman was quite the enigma and always brought a smile to his face. She showed up out of nowhere one day, named him Jameson for his Irish accent and the whisky behind the bar and then started turning up every other day for a drink or a ""swimmer"" - her water version of a roadie - and always had a smile on her face. He named her Jack after her preferred drink and always found a reason to be smiling back at her. He knew almost nothing about her other than she was an Aussie, was easy on the eye, even easier to get along with and that she lived about 10 houses down from the bar overlooking the lake. Her tiny stature and long, thick hair made her hard to miss.



""Morning Jack. The weather's starting to get a bit cool to be paddling don't you think? And I hear there's some rain heading our way. You don't want to be going too far today"" he said with concern in his voice. She looked back up at him and for the first time ever, he saw no smile in her eyes.



""G'day Jameson. Not going far, just for a float in the sun. Got some demons to drown. I'll be needing 3 swimmers today please - if you've got them?""



""Three? That's a lot to be drinking way out there in the middle of the lake. What happens if you roll off that paddleboard? Screwed if I can swim that far"" He noticed the sad look in her eyes and decided to just let her have what she needed. ""Let me get those drinks for you. I'll put them on your tab and you can sort it out this afternoon when you get back.""

* The RNG of the crablets where they spawn/respawn. Sometimes the 3 are infront of you, sometimes they're at the other end of the stage.
* The RNG of their damage once you break them, I've seen mine as low as 20K and as high as 220K.
* The cast time of the crablets when you break them is too long. There are multiple instances where I only need 1 more hit with 3 seconds left but they did not hit it in time.
* You only have 10 seconds to go ham, but there will be a 3-4 seconds delay first because of your burst animation. Then the crab itself will take 10 seconds, have a cigarette and coffee first before respawning.
* The targeting is all over the place.
* The staggers! With the input delay before you can switch or cast is already a pain, then you get staggered and you don't know where because the camera angle.

I know it can be done with non-meta characters. I've seen a Gorou main, and a Eula team finishing this one. But there is no good reason why a heavily invested Furina (C3), Yelan (C1), and Skirk (C0) should have this much trouble. This might be the first SO that I might not finish Fearless.

My client (a mid-sized logistics firm) sent over a ""small batch"" of 1,100 invoices late Friday. They needed the data—line items, tax IDs, and totals—structured into their database by Monday morning for a legacy audit.

**The Hubris:**

Instead of looking for a specialized tool, I thought, *""I’ll just use a basic OCR library and a regex script. If that fails, I’ll just manually copy-paste the tricky ones. It’s just 1,000 PDFs, how long could it really take?""*

**The Descent into Madness:**

* **Saturday, 10:00 AM:** I realized the ""Data Transformation Puzzle"" is real. The invoices weren't one-size-fits-all; they were from 50 different vendors. My rigid script was outputting garbage.
* **Saturday, 2:00 PM:** Entered the ""Endless Copy-Paste Loop"". Automation looked great until the PDF formatting gaps made my script skip half the fields.
* **Saturday, 8:00 PM:** Hit the ""OCR Accuracy Ceiling"". Inaccurate and unusable data from complex layouts meant I was now manually correcting every third line.
* **Sunday, 3:00 AM:** This is where I lost it. My system could ""read"" the text but had no ""Missing Brain""—it didn't understand the relationship between a ""Discount"" and the ""Subtotal"". I was basically a high-paid human typewriter.

**The Financial/Mental Toll:** Manual data processing is a constant drain on resources. By Sunday afternoon, I had spent 20+ hours doing what I realized was a ""slow, error-ridden"" task that was a total financial loss for my weekend.



**The ""Duh"" Moment:** I finally remembered **DocuProx**. I logged into [app.docuprox.com](https://app.docuprox.com/), configured a template for the most complex vendor in minutes , and grabbed my unique Template ID.

I integrated the API and pushed the remaining 600 PDFs through. The API returned structured JSON in real-time. What took me 15 hours manually took the Multimodal Vision LLM about... well, I had enough time to actually eat a meal.

**TL;DR:** Don't be like me. Don't try to out-copy-paste a document processing problem. If you’re struggling with unstructured information, just go to [www.docuprox.com](http://www.docuprox.com/) and save your weekend.

**Edit:** To the guy who sent me these invoices on a Friday afternoon: I hope your coffee is perpetually lukewarm.

1qmc1or,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1qmc1or/bes990_oracle_touch_shower_screen_replacement/,BES990 Oracle Touch - Shower Screen Replacement.,"Hi all,  
  
I'm hoping to get some guidance from anyone who has done a dispersion plate / shower screen upgrade on a Breville BES990 (Oracle Touch).  
  
My original plastic dispersion plate cracked, so I replaced the entire shower assembly with an aftermarket stainless kit from Amazon (new dispersion plate / screen holder, new shower screen, and new gasket). Everything installed fine mechanically.  
  
The problem:  
After the upgrade, the machine chokes badly and the puck is being physically crushed by the group head:  
• Puck has a shower screen mesh and screw head imprint  
• Coffee sticks to the screen  
• Puck comes out as a rock-hard cake that has to be pried out  
• Flow is slow (Unless I use a very coarse grind)  
  
My hunch is this could be a headspace problem, not a grind or tamp issue.  
  
I measured the new stainless shower screen holder / dispersion plate, and it is 11.8 mm thick. That seems 1mm thicker than the stock plastic Breville part. Combined with the included gasket, it looks like the shower assembly is sitting far too low in the group, eliminating headspace and crushing the puck.  
  
What's the correct dimensions for a BES990-compatible dispersion plate/screen holder?  
  
Specifically, I'm looking for:  
1. Recommended stainless dispersion plate / shower holder that matches Breville's original geometry  
2. Correct thickness (Outer edge, and the dispersion plate, not just diameter)  
3. Whether I need a low-profile (slim) group gasket when using stainless plates  
4. Any known good brands or part numbers (IMS, Breville, aftermarket, etc.) that actually fit the BES990 correctly  
5. If you can provide me some links for the replacement parts that has worked for you.  
  
If anyone has measured their stock Breville dispersion plate or has successfully upgraded to stainless on a BES990 without losing headspace, I'd really appreciate the details.",1,1769324178.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False

""Y-your brothers have come to... to withdraw you. They're taking you home.""

Home. The word echoes, hollow and wrong.

I don't have a home. Not anymore.

I turn. And the world drops out from under me.

Lorenzo stands against the back wall. Unmoving. Watchful. Older. Harder.

Vincenzo beside him, eyes sharp and assessing.

My brothers. Here.

""Hi, Gianna.""

The sound of my name on his lips almost cracks something open.

Every ounce of anger I've carried for five years coils tight in my chest.

""Dad will explain everything when we get home.""

Dad.

The word lands wrong. Heavy. Foreign.

And then I say the one thing he clearly isn't prepared for.

""I don't have a father anymore.""

The words come out cold. Devoid of emotion. Like facts read off a page.

""You all stopped being my family five years ago. When you shipped me to another country. Changed my name. Exiled me.""

The girl they abandoned is dust. What stands before them now does not bend. Does not beg. Does not forget. And she's only just started collecting what they owe her.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Gianna Pov

My family sucks.

At this point, I don't know why I ever let myself have even the smallest shred of hope that they might change.

It's been like this for five years now.

Ever since they wrote me off. Believed a lie because it was easier than believing me.

Pricks.

My life really is like a Disney movie-if you strip out all the magic and replace it with trauma.

I'm the fat, ugly duckling with an evil twin sister. Cast aside. Exiled. Sent away to live in a tower.

Except it's not a tower.

It's a strict-as-sin all-girls reform school in the middle of Germany.

And somehow? I run this bimbo.

There's no loving family waiting for my safe return. No lanterns lighting the way home like Rapunzel. Just a family that wishes I were dead.

And honestly? The feeling's mutual.

Because when that tiny seed of hope gets shoved down-way, way, way deep-all that's left is hatred.

If this were really a Disney movie, I would've been rescued by now. Swept away by some hot prince with a thick accent and a savior complex.

But I'm not a damsel.

And I don't need saving.

All I need... is me.

The one time in the last five years I let myself trust someone, he did exactly what everyone else in my miserable life has done.

He left me broken.

Never again.

The blankets rustle as I pull them tighter around my shoulders, curling deeper into bed as the digital clock glows in the darkness of my cell-

I mean... tower.

Room.

12:02 a.m.

It's officially my seventeenth birthday.

And my father couldn't even be bothered to call.

I know, I know-you're probably thinking relax, you crazy bimbo, it's only two minutes past midnight.

But back when I still had a family-back when I was stupid enough to believe I mattered-my father never missed it. Not once.

Every year, without fail, he'd come into my sister's and my shared bedroom... or call right at twelve on the dot. Just so he could be the first to say it.

Happy birthday.

""Happy birthday to me,"" I whisper, crushing every emotion that tries to claw its way to the surface.

Five years.

No phone calls.

No holidays.

No birthdays.

No visits.

Nothing.

They don't deserve a place in my life.

And they sure as sin don't deserve a place in my heart.

They wouldn't recognize me now-even if they tried.

Rolling onto my side, I force myself to breathe in... and out.

Just like he taught me.

Then I let the nightmares take me

\*

The sound of violent banging rips me out of sleep.

I jerk, heart racing, eyes struggling to focus as pale morning light spills through the tall, narrow windows of my room. For a second, I don't know where I am-or who I'm supposed to be today.

Then reality slams back into place.

""What time is it...?""

I squint at the digital clock glowing on my nightstand.

10:00.

""Oh-shiit.""

I bolt upright.

""Sh.it, sh.it, sh.it.""

I forgot to turn on my alarm.

They are going to kill me.

I'm out of bed in seconds, dragging open drawers, yanking on the stiff gray uniform skirt and blouse the school insists we wear on transport days. I barely bother buttoning it properly, hands shaking as I shove my feet into shoes.

At the last second, I grab my bag and stuff a pair of worn jeans and a black top inside.

I'm not spending the entire day dressed like a sanctioned ghost.

I rake my fingers through my hair, not even pretending to tame it, and fling my door open-

\-and narrowly avoid getting punched in the face.

Annalese freezes mid-swing, eyes wide. ""sorry, Gia!""

""Come on!"" I snap, grabbing her wrist before she can even apologize again.

I drag her down the narrow spiral staircase of my tower, boots pounding against stone steps worn smooth by years of isolation and punishment masquerading as concern.

Yes. A tower.

I wasn't being dramatic last night.

Apparently, my family-and the administration-decided I'm too unstable to live with the other girls. Easier to keep me separate. Easier to keep me quiet. Easier to pretend I'm not here.

We take the stairs two at a time, nearly tripping as we burst onto the main landing and sprint toward the front of the school.

""NO RUNNING!"" the janitor shouts after us, shaking her mop like it's a weapon.

We don't even slow down.

I nearly double over laughing when I spot Isa at the transport doors, bent in half, clutching her stomach like she's in the middle of a medical emergency.

She's committed. I'll give her that.

""Miss Valen,"" the driver says flatly, arms crossed. ""We need to leave. Either get on the bus or go to medical.""

""Y-yeah, I will,"" Isa groans dramatically. ""I just-ahhh-oh my God-""

She squeezes her eyes shut, swaying.

Then she peeks between her lashes, spots us flying toward her from the left, and straightens instantly.

""Oh! Wow,"" she says, brushing imaginary dust off her skirt. ""Must've been the last cramp. I feel so much better.""

The driver just sighs, clearly aware but choosing peace, as Annalese and I pile onto the bus behind her, breathless, laughing, and barely avoiding consequences-again.

We collapse into the back row of the transport bus like we've just escaped a war zone.

Isa drops into the seat first, cheeks flushed, arms crossed tight over her chest. Annalese slides in beside her, smoothing her skirt, still breathing a little too fast. I take the window, clutching my bag like it's the only thing tethering me to sanity.

The doors hiss shut.

The bus lurches forward.

Only then does Isa groan and drag her hands down her face.

""I cannot believe I just did that.""

I snort. ""You were convincing.""

She shoots me a glare. ""I faked period cramps in front of a grown adult with a clipboard, Gia. That's a new low.""

Annalese laughs softly. ""You did save us, though.""

Isa sighs, shoulders slumping. ""Yeah, well. Still humiliating.""

The bus rattles as the gates slide open, the stone walls of the school slowly falling away behind us. I lean my forehead against the cool glass, watching the towers disappear.

Once a week.

That's all we get.

One transport out. One transport back.

Miss the bus going out? Too bad-there's always next week.

Miss the one coming back?

You lose the privilege entirely.

It took me two years before they let me leave.

Two years of ""good behavior.""

Two years of no incidents.

I was a different girl then.

""So,"" Annalese says gently, breaking the silence. ""We still going to Steiger's ?""

I turn, a slow smile curling at the corner of my mouth. ""Of course.""

Isa rolls her eyes. ""Of course.""

""I've got training,"" I add casually. ""And Jonas texted me last night ago, jonas said I have a fight on the books at three.

""Isa groans. ""You are unhinged.""

Annalese bites her lip, worried. ""Do you have to?""

I glance at her, softening. ""I don't have to. I want to.""

Steiger's isn't just a place-it's survival.

It's a local fight venue tucked beneath an old warehouse, the kind of place people from the underworld gravitate toward when they're in town. No cameras. No questions. Cash only.

The first time I came here, I was fifteen.

Unhealthy. Weak. Angry.

Part of it was depression.

The other part?

I really, really love food-and eating my feelings.

I'd wandered too far from the market, distracted, tired. Cornered. Two men. I didn't know how to fight. Didn't know how to scream loud enough.

Jonas-the owner-and his son, Henry, stepped in before it got worse.

After that, once a week, I was there.

Training. Fighting. Learning discipline.

They gave me structure.

A routine I could keep-even back at the school.

And slowly... everything changed.

Mentally.

Physically.

Emotionally.

Mostly.

Annalese glances at my bag. ""Are we changing before we get there?""

I smirk, tapping it with my foot. ""Of course. I am not walking around the village looking like a haunted schoolgirl all day.""

Isa snorts despite herself. ""Good. Because you look like a ghost that escaped a convent.""

The bus hums beneath us, carrying us farther from the school, closer to freedom.

Just for today.

\*

The bus slows as the road narrows, cobblestone rattling beneath the tires.

The village comes into view like something stolen from a postcard-stone buildings clustered together, narrow streets, little shops just waking up. A bakery with its windows fogged from heat. A cafe dragging chairs outside. Normal life.

Freedom.

The bus hisses as it comes to a stop in the small gravel lot just outside the village center.

No one moves.

We all know better.

The aisle creaks as Frau Keller stands.

A collective, silent groan ripples through the bus.

She's tall, stiff-backed, dressed in gray like she was born offended by color. Her lips press together as she surveys us, eyes sharp and disapproving-like she already knows we're planning crimes.

She hates us.

We hate her.

It's mutual. Efficient.

""Before anyone exits,"" she says sharply, her accent slicing through the bus, ""we will go over the rules. Again.""

Isa mutters under her breath, ""Thrilling.""

I elbow her lightly.

Frau Keller's gaze snaps in our direction, but she continues.

""You are here on privilege, not right. One day. One outing."" She lifts a finger. ""You will stay within the village boundaries. You will not enter restricted establishments. You will not start fights, steal, disappear, or embarrass this institution.""

Her eyes linger on me for half a second too long.

Shocker.

""You will return to this bus by 6 o'clock sharp,"" she continues. ""Not six -oh-one. Not six-oh-two. Late arrivals will lose village privileges indefinitely.""

A pause.

""If you miss the return transport,"" she says coolly, ""you will not be allowed to leave again. Ever.""

The air tightens.

Everyone here knows that rule.

It took me two years before I was trusted enough to sit on this bus. Two years of swallowed rage. Of silence. Of proving I wasn't the girl they decided I was.

I was a different girl then.

Frau Keller folds her hands. ""You will be searched upon return. Any contraband will result in punishment.""

She steps aside and gestures toward the door.

""You may go.""

For a split second, no one moves.

Then the doors open with a hydraulic sigh, and the spell breaks.

Girls pour out in clusters, laughter bursting free the moment their feet hit the ground. Voices rise. Shoulders straighten. Smiles bloom like they've been starved for sunlight.

Annalese exhales, almost reverent. ""I forgot how good it smells out here.""

Isa cracks her neck. ""That's called freedom.""

I step down last, the village air cool against my skin, my bag slung over my shoulder-jeans and a black top waiting inside like a promise.

Frau Keller watches us from the bus steps, arms crossed, eyes already counting the hours until she gets us back.

I don't look at her.

I look forward.

My knuckles already tingling with anticipation, today of all days I need a release.

\*

Steiger's sits at the edge of the village where the streets narrow and the buildings lean closer together, brick darkened by age and secrets. No sign. No windows. Just a heavy metal door tucked beneath a faded warehouse awning like it doesn't want to be found.

The kind of place you only notice if you're looking for it.

Annalese slows beside me, fingers tightening around the strap of her bag.

""This is where I peel off,"" she says quietly.

Isa snorts. ""You sure? You could watch Gia rearrange someone's face.""

Annalese wrinkles her nose, though she smiles. ""I'll pass. It's... loud. And rough. And it smells like blood and regret.""

I smirk. ""That's part of the charm.""

She bumps her shoulder lightly against mine. ""I know it is. Just not for me.""

Her gaze flicks to the door-steel, scarred, uninviting-then back to me, worry softening her eyes. ""You'll be careful?""

""Always,"" I say automatically.

She doesn't look convinced.

""There's a little bookstore near the square,"" she adds. ""The one with the blue shutters. I want to check if they have anything in English.""

""Of course you do,"" Isa says, rolling her eyes fondly. ""Text us if you find something depressing.""

Annalese laughs. ""I will.""

She hesitates, then steps forward and wraps her arms around me in a quick, tight hug. She smells like soap and paper and something gentle that doesn't belong near places like this.

""Seven o'clock,"" she reminds me softly. ""Don't be late.""

""I won't,"" I promise.

She pulls back, gives Isa a small wave, then turns and heads back toward the brighter streets of the village, her figure slowly swallowed by sunlight and quiet.

Isa watches her go, then clicks her tongue. ""Smart one, that girl.""

""She is,"" I agree.

Isa grins at me, sharp and unapologetic. ""Ready to make bad decisions?""

I glance at the door.

At the place that saved me.

""Always.""

I knock once.

The door swings open, and the noise hits like a punch-music, shouts, metal on metal, the roar of bodies colliding. Heat. Sweat. Electricity.

And just like that...

I'm home.

Alessia Pov

Sunlight spills through the sheer curtains, warm and indulgent, brushing over silk sheets and expensive furniture like it knows exactly where it belongs.

I stretch slowly, luxuriating in the space around me.

My room is beautiful-high ceilings, pale walls, a crystal chandelier that catches the light just right. Everything curated. Everything perfect. Just like it should be.

I smile to myself as I sit up.

It's my birthday.

Seventeen.

The thought makes a soft laugh slip from my lips. Excited? Of course I am. The entire day will be about me-gifts, attention, admiration.

Then again... when isn't it?

""Please,"" I murmur to my reflection in the darkened window. ""Every day is about me.""

I slide out of bed and move toward the bathroom, bare feet sinking into plush carpet. My routine is practiced, flawless-cleansed skin, soft makeup, just enough to look effortless while still being devastating.

When I return to my room, I choose the dress I laid out the night before. Short. Structured. Preppy in the way that makes people think good girl when they should know better. Heels click softly as I step into them, grounding me.

I stop in front of the mirror.

Perfect.

My hair falls in loose waves down my back, my waist narrow, my legs long and toned. I turn slightly, inspecting every angle, every line. There's satisfaction there-deep and unquestioned.

This is what they see.

This is what they chose.

My smile sharpens as an unwanted thought flickers through my mind.

My twin.

The corner of my mouth twitches.

God, it's almost funny.

I picture her the way she was the last time I saw her-soft, round, always taking up too much space. Always eating. Always looking like she wanted something she couldn't have.

The fat sister.

The embarrassing one.

The one who ruined everything just by existing.

I tilt my head, studying my reflection again, reassured by the contrast. By the distance. By how thoroughly that chapter of my life has been erased.

She's gone.

And I'm still here.

I smooth my dress, lift my chin, and smile at myself-wide, bright, practiced.

Seventeen looks good on me.

I hear them before I see them.

Voices drift up the hall as I move toward the dining room, overlapping, amused, competitive.

""I'm telling you, she'll like mine more.""

""You bought her jewelry again. She already has too much.""

""She doesn't have this.""

I slow my steps just outside the doorway, smiling to myself.

Of course they're arguing.

Every year, it's the same-my brothers circling, posturing, desperate to be the one who pleases me most. Gifts wrapped perfectly. Attention lavished freely.

They've always been like this.

Wrapped around my finger.

Every single one of them.

Even my father.

I step into the room.

The argument stops instantly.

Six heads turn. Smiles spread. Chairs shift. The energy changes, bending toward me like gravity has rules only I get to break.

""There she is,"" Marco says, grinning. ""Birthday girl.""

""Finally decided to join us,"" Enzo adds. ""We were about to start without you.""

I laugh lightly, letting the sound carry just enough sweetness. ""You wouldn't dare.""

My father sits at the head of the table, as he always does-posture immaculate, expression warm in a way he saves only for moments like this. He looks up when he sees me, pride unmistakable in his eyes.

""Buon compleanno, Alessia,"" he says. ""Seventeen.""

I walk toward him, heels clicking softly against marble, and lean down to [ki.ss](http://ki.ss) his cheek. ""Thank you, Papa.""

I feel it then-the familiar sense of triumph. Of safety. Of knowing exactly where I stand.

Loved. Chosen.

It had been almost too easy five years ago.

The lie, I mean.

I'd been close to Lorenzo then. Close enough to know how to shape it. Close enough to know what would sound believable. And really-who wouldn't believe me?

I'd been the good one. The perfect one. The daughter who never caused trouble.

The truth never stood a chance.

""Sit,"" my father says gently, gesturing toward my place. ""Breakfast first.""

A chorus of groans answers him.

""Presents,"" Nico protests. ""Come on, Papa.""

""Yes, presents,"" Elio adds. ""It's cruel to make her wait.""

My father lifts a brow, amused but firm. ""Breakfast. Then gifts. I want to watch you all behave like civilized men for at least ten minutes.""

They grumble but obey.

I take my seat, smoothing my dress, basking in the attention as plates are passed and coffee poured. My brothers watch me like I might disappear if they look away.

All of them-except one.

Lorenzo sits a few seats down, expression unreadable, posture rigid. He meets my gaze briefly.

""Happy birthday,"" he says.

Nothing more. No smile. No warmth.

Just obligation.

It annoys me more than it should.

He had been the closest to her once.

I look away first.

Food is served. Forks clink. Conversation resumes, light and loud and full of me.

Breakfast first.

Then presents.

And after that?

The rest of the day will unfold exactly as it always does.

Around me.

Salvatore POV

I sit at the head of the table and watch my children.

It's a habit I never quite broke-the assessment, the quiet tally of strengths and weaknesses, the constant calculation of what they are becoming. A Don does not simply raise sons. He forges them.

The dining room hums with noise. Cutlery against porcelain. Low laughter. Competing voices.

Lorenzo sits to my right, spine straight, expression unreadable. He eats methodically, eyes flicking up only when necessary. He is my heir in every way that matters-controlled, disciplined, sealed tight. Emotion has never ruled him.

It is also his greatest flaw.

Across from him, Marco leans back in his chair, broad shoulders tense even at rest. He speaks little, but when he does, the table quiets. He has always understood violence the way others understand language. Direct. Efficient. Loyal.

Alessandro, beside him, talks with his hands, already dissecting something only he can see-routes, numbers, probabilities. His mind moves faster than most men twice his age. Strategy is not something he learned. It is something he is.

The oldest three.

The pillars.

Then there is Vincenzo.

He laughs too loudly, fork abandoned in favor of gesturing wildly as he recounts something I already know involved broken knuckles and poor impulse control. Volatile. Dangerous. Useful, if pointed in the right direction.

I watch him carefully.

At the far end of the table sit the youngest.

Domenico leans forward, jaw tight, eyes sharp. He hates waiting. Hates being told no. Control matters to him-too much, perhaps-but that fire will either make him powerful or reckless. Time will decide.

Elio, beside him, says almost nothing. He eats quietly, gaze drifting-not unfocused, but watching. He sees everything. Always has. That kind of silence can be more dangerous than rage.

My sons.

My legacy.

And then there is Alessia.

She sits near the center, radiant, laughing easily as attention bends toward her without effort. Every movement is practiced, every smile perfectly placed. She has always known how to be adored.

Seventeen today.

My chest tightens-just slightly-before I school my expression.

There is... an absence.

A familiar ache I pretend not to feel.

Another daughter should be sitting here.

The thought comes uninvited.

I press my fingers briefly against the edge of the table, grounding myself. It has been five years. The decision was made. Necessary. Final.

Still-

The pain lingers, sharp and unwelcome.

Before I can follow the thought further, the heavy doors at the far end of the dining room slam open.

Conversation dies instantly.

Every head snaps toward the sound.

A presence fills the room-cold, immense, undeniable.

My father stands in the doorway.

He has not set foot in this house in five years.

Not since the day we sent Gianna away.

His posture is rigid, his silver hair combed back with military precision, eyes dark and assessing as they sweep over the table. He does not smile.

He never did.

For a moment, no one moves. No one breathes.

I rise slowly from my chair.

""Padre,"" I say carefully.

His gaze locks onto mine, sharp as a blade.

I watch my father stand in the doorway like time itself decided to walk back into the house.

Age has not bent him. If anything, it has sharpened him-lines etched deep into his face, eyes still dark and commanding. He steps into the room without hesitation, and the air shifts immediately.

My sons rise to their feet.

One by one.

Lorenzo first, respectful and silent.

Marco next, shoulders squared.

Alessandro nods, already calculating.

Vincenzo straightens with barely contained energy.

Domenico stiffens, jaw tight.

Elio simply watches.

My father's gaze moves over them slowly.

Fondly.

He addresses each of them by name-asking after their training, their studies, their discipline. His voice is firm, but there is pride there. Approval.

It settles into my chest like a weight.

Then I notice who he does not acknowledge.

Alessia sits perfectly still, smile frozen, hands folded in her lap.

Ignored.

My jaw tightens.

I don't interrupt. I never have. Respect for my father is not optional-it is instinct. He built this empire long before I inherited it. His word still carries weight, whether I like it or not.

But the omission is deliberate.

And it angers me.

I always asked myself why didn't I last long because I am physically active, I eat healthy, I only drink water, tea and sometimes coffee. 

To my findings it was actually porn. This is not those bs posts telling u to stop fapping. Porn overstimulates your brain causing hypersensitivity to your penis. I always had hard rock erections however hypersensitivity caused pe not the hard rock erections as many of us think it will cause pe hence some guys fap an hour before game time.

My routine: -I fap twice a week without porn/lube.
-I dont fap 2 days before sex.
- Meditate every morning sometimes at night.
- 6-8 hours of sleep(inconsistent)
- Normal diet(takeaways on weekends) but I eat 3 eggs at least 5 out of 7 days a week.

I dont recommend the fapping twice a week if u are not seeing anyone or having a potential hookup. Rather abstain and fap when u find someone. With that being said quit porn.

I won’t even get into the anxiety, reduced production overall, and mental fog that it causes, because that has been hashed out many times on this forum (which I think is crucial for the destruction of the lies created by big caffeine). Anyways, the way that I quit was to slowly reduce my caffeine intake, from cups of coffee, green and black tea, energy drinks, and even caffeine capsules, to opening a 100 mg capsule of caffeine, sprinkling a tiny bit on my tongue and taking a swig of water. I estimate that amount to be about 10 mg. It got me thinking about the homeopathic method, where a certain chemical is diluted to tiny fractions of a percent in the belief that much much less is actually more, or may counter the effect of that particular chemical. Has anyone tried this? For example, imagine diluting a cup of coffee, so much that the water is nearly clear, but there is a tiny amount of coffee and thus caffeine in it.

1qmbpgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1qmbpgu/the_things_youre_supposed_to_ignore_after_turning/,The Things You’re Supposed to Ignore After Turning 18,"I turned eighteen on a Tuesday, which meant cake from the grocery store, two candles because my mom hates odd numbers, and a quiet knock at the door that nobody else heard. 

The envelope was plain, already open, my name spelled the way my teachers used to spell it before I corrected them. 

Inside was a single page, folded wrong, like it had been refolded by someone who didn’t understand hands. At the top it said, *You will understand this later.* Under that were the rules. I laughed, because that’s what you do when something feels like a prank and your chest tightens anyway.

**Rule One:** **After eighteen, ignore knocking you didn’t invite.**

**Rule Two:** **If someone says your name from outside, wait for them to say it wrong.**

**Rule Three:** **Do not explain the rules to anyone younger.**

**Rule Four:** **If you already broke a rule, stop reading and act normal.**

I folded the paper and put it in my wallet, because adulthood is mostly learning where to put things you don’t want to think about. College started. I moved into a shared house with my friend Mark, who turned eighteen two months after me and still called it “being legal” like it was a punchline.

 The first night, while we were unpacking, there was a knock on the back door. Three slow taps. Mark stood up before I could stop him.

“Probably the landlord,” he said, already smiling, already wrong.

I remembered **Rule One** too late. I remembered **Rule Two** when the voice outside said my name perfectly, soft and careful, like it was afraid to scare me away. Mark opened the door anyway. 

There was nothing there. No person, no shadow, just the porch light flickering like it was blinking on purpose. Mark laughed, but his laugh had an echo that didn’t match the room. After that, he kept getting things wrong. Small things. He called me by my full name even though he never had. He knocked on my door before entering, every single time, even when I told him to stop.

A week later, another envelope appeared on the kitchen table. This one had coffee stains on it, like it had been set down and picked up again. Mark found it first.

“What’s this?” he asked, unfolding it. I told him not to read it. I told him **Rule Three** without calling it a rule, said it like advice, like concern. He read it anyway. His eyes moved too fast, then too slow. He smiled like he’d won something.

That night, the knocking came back, louder now, from inside the walls. Not taps anymore—scraping, like fingernails learning what drywall feels like. The voice didn’t bother with names. 

It started listing dates. Birthdays. First jobs. The day Mark got his driver’s license. The day I moved out. Dates we both recognized, spoken in the wrong order.

**Rule Five:** **If the knocking moves, leave the room you’re in.**

**Rule Six:** **If it follows, do not run. Running teaches it your pace.**

Mark panicked. He ran. I stayed, shaking so hard my teeth clicked. I heard him in the hallway, tripping, apologizing to someone who wasn’t there. The knocking chased him, thudding now, heavy, like something practicing weight. 

When it reached his door, there was a sound like fabric tearing, then a wet silence that pressed against the house. After that, Mark stopped knocking before entering. He stopped knocking at all.

In the morning, the house was wrong. Mark was still there, sitting at the table, hands folded, staring at the spot where the envelope had been. He didn’t blink when I waved. He didn’t breathe until I looked away. When he finally spoke, he said my name almost right.

**Rule Seven:** **If someone breaks the rules visibly, you must ignore the evidence.**

**Rule Eight:** **Ignoring is not the same as pretending.**

I moved out that day. On my way to the car, there was a knock from inside the trunk. Three slow taps. I didn’t open it. 

I drove with the radio on loud, because silence is how it counts. At my new apartment, the envelopes kept coming, thinner now, more urgent. New rules added themselves between old ones. Some contradicted each other. Some were crossed out, then written again in darker ink.

**Final Rule:** **If you think you’ve outgrown the rules, you’re finally visible.**

I’m writing this because the knocking has started again, closer this time, like it learned something from Mark that it’s excited to try on me. 

If you’re reading this and you’re under eighteen, stop. If you’re over eighteen and you’ve ever heard a knock you didn’t invite, you already know which rule you broke first. Tell me which one you think it was.

My feelings were real but I let them take over and acted out which was not justified.

One of my best friends/roomates (f22) had a first date with a guy for coffee at around 9am, i got a text a couple hours late saying that they were going to come over to the house to watch a movie. Fine enough, i decided to run errands to be out of the way.

A couple hours later i get back the house and saw her car in the driveway. I texted her asking how it went to no response so i checked her room and she wasnt there. I started to get really anxious.

I call a little while after to no response but then a call back a minute later where she sounded like she was having a lot of fun and that she was at the mall with this same guy. (Its now around 3 or so). For some reason thats where i really started to get upset, I really dont know entirely why but with the anxiety and then some jealousy? I was kinda mad a little bit. I then spent the next several hours kinda just stewing, not a great idea, and then they came back over to the house to watch another movie.

After the guy left i came out of my room and talked briefly with my friend but just was angry and wasnt myself, at one point i chucked a ball across the room and punched the couch a couple times, then went for a drive.

Weve talked about it a couple times since and Ive apologized cause i feel really bad that I let myself behave like that but she has kind of just emphasized that she is just disappointed and doesn't feel comfortable talking about her dates anymore and doesn't want me to meet him for now.

I completely understand how much I was in the wrong but im mainly just wondering how do I move forward with this? Is it truly just we have to give it time? Is there any other way I can show her how truly sorry I am and that I dont really know why I lost control like that?

1qmbodu,https://i.redd.it/hfpujofgxffg1.png,In Bed With My Ex’s Brother-In-Law,"Chapter 1 He Left For A Rich Girl

Aria's POV

I stood in front of the chapel.

Pink roses and white lilies decorated every corner. My favorite flowers.

The guests were already seated. Soon, at the end of the red carpet would stand the man I once loved, waiting to marry his bride.

Everything was perfect.

Except I wasn't the bride.

“I really need to see Jace today.”

I begged the bodyguard blocking the door. A beat-up suitcase and two boxes sat at my feet. Everything I owned in the world.

""No you don’t. Get out of here,"" the bodyguard said icily.

I saw disgust in his eyes. Yeah I get it. No one has sympathy for the crazy ex who shows up at the wedding.

But I have my reason to be here.

""If you don't let me see him, I'll just stand here and all the guests will see me,"" I threatened under my breath.

Jace wouldn't want that. Especially not today.

Because today, he was marrying Delilah Hart.

She is the sister to Alpha Grayson Hart of Redstone Pack. A 100% high-society darling.

All the guys in the world knew that marrying Delilah would totally change their lives, including Jace.

So he made the easy call—marrying the lady who could turn him from a small-town nobody into a golden boy. And dump the girl who stayed by his side for last 4 years when he had nothing.

He didn’t want any guests to see me here. Because I represented his broke, embarrassing past. He wanted me nowhere near his glittering new world.

Tears stung my eyes as I thought of that. Like a knife was twisting in my chest.

“Let me in or I’m starting to yell.” I choked.

The bodyguard frowned. ""Wait here.""

He finally called somebody. A few minutes later, he waved me in.

I wiped my eyes and struggled into the hall with my suitcase and boxes.

Instantly, I felt out of place.

Everything reeked of wealth here. Expensive perfume. Manicured nails. Not a hair out of place. It was everything you imagined about the upper-class and way more.

And me?

I was wearing a baggy T-shirt and jeans. My sneakers had holes.

""God, a homeless. She stinks."" A woman mutter as I walked by.

No it couldn’t be. I just showered this morning. My hair still smelled like strawberries and coconut.

But poverty had a scent, apparently.

""Mr. Carter is inside."" The guard took me to a closed door and warned, “Make it quick.”

“Thank you.”

The room inside looked like something out of a movie. Marble floors. White carpet. A chandelier that probably cost more than my apartment.

And there he was.

The man I used to love.

Adjusting his bowtie in front of a mirror.

Jace was still heartbreakingly handsome. No wonder Delilah fell for him.

When he turned and fixed his gorgeous blue eyes upon me, I still felt my heart race.

""Hey, Jace,"" I said quietly.

And immediately, I wanted to punch myself.

Hey, Jace?!

That’s the best I could do?

His face was ice cold.

""You shouldn't come, Aria.” he said with a frown. “Your ratty suitcase, your ripped jeans, your Vans. None of that belongs here.""

Well if you wanted to be brutal and vicious, that’s how it’s done.

""Don’t you think I deserve an explanation? You dumped me over a fucking email!"" I snapped.

He shrugged. ""Look around you. The wealthiest people in the world came for me today. This suit I’m wearing cost more than you can make in your entire life. What more explanation do you want?""

Wow.

I always knew he was a cold, calculating bastard.

I just didn’t realize how deep it ran.

""Maybe chasing Alpha’s sister got you here faster. But you know what? When she finds out how shallow and cold you are. You’ll lose it all.""

Anger flared across his face.

""I know how to love someone! I just won't waste that on a small-town girl like you.” he said freezingly, “Are we done here?""

“No.”

I took a deep breath and got into the real reason I came.

""You're marrying a rich girl. Fine. But why did you have to get me fired?""

Yeah. I used to work for this jerk.

From intern to full-time at Apex Corp, he was my supervisor.

Our office romance was a secret. And just days ago, I found out he was getting married with Apex CEO’s sister. And I was out of a job thanks to him.

""Right, your job.” The jerk shrugged, “You got your job all thanks to me. Now that I’m not around, maybe they finally saw how incompetent and stupid you are. Problem?""

Was he fucking kidding me?!

""I graduated top of my class. Made it through 7 rounds of interviews. My performance exceeded every quarterly target. I earned that job!"" I snapped.

“Come on, Aria. You really gonna be so naïve?”

He walked closer, smirking.

""You passed the interviews because I said so. Your sales? I contacted those customers for you. Without me, you'd be nothing but a pretty face.""

He seized my chin and looked me over with a disgusting look. I slapped his hand away.

""Give me my job back,” I hissed, my voice slightly trembling. “My dad’s debt. My grandma’s medical bills…I need the money. You of all people should know what it’s like to be poor. Don’t. Make. Me. Beg.""

I was throwing my pride at his feet.

But he just laughed.

""Well, how about I offer you a deal?"" he said as though he’d been waiting for this moment.

He brushed my hair back, fingers trailing down to my collarbone. I shivered in disgust.

""You and I. We never fuck. You were so clinging to that pathetic no-sex-before-marriage rule. Maybe it's time to grow up. Let me fuck you once and I’ll write you very handsome check. How does that sound?""

I widened my eyes in shock.

Then I slapped him. HARD.

“FUCKING HELL…What the hell are you doing?! I’m getting married in front of everyone in fucking 10 minutes!” He roared covering his swollen face.

""Fuck you, Jace!” I yelled, “You're a spineless freeloading puss! And hey—congrats on the wedding. Hope your junk is soft like a fucking spaghetti tonight!""

Then I stormed out dragging my suitcase and boxes, ignoring his angry curses behind me.

Hot tears poured down as I dashed across the hallway.

God this couldn’t be any worse.

I was prepared to drop all my self-esteem and begged with my life. Because I needed the job and money.

But I still let him get to me.

Now what do I do?

My salary barely covered my rent, my father’s debt and grandma’s bill. Now with my job gone, I already got kicked out by my landlord. I probably had to sleep in a park tonight.

So do I go back and let that jerk win? Let him humiliate me...No. I’d rather die than that…

""Hey, watch where you're going!"" someone yelled.

Too late.

I slammed right into the man in front of me.

He was tall. So tall I felt like I’d just walked into a brick wall.

His diamond cufflink was sharp like a blade. When we collided, it sliced clean through my thin T-shirt with a loud rip.

In one second, the front of my shirt was torn open, exposing my white lace bra.

“Ah!” I gasped and looked up.

This was the most handsome man I’d ever seen. His face was like a statue carved by a master artist. And his expression was so cold and distant.

When he looked down at me, I swear I was about to drown in those stormy gray eyes of his.

Suddenly, I recognized who he was.

This was Alpha of Redstone Pack. CEO of Apex Corporation.

Jace’s brother-in-law.

THE legendary. Grayson Hart.

“Aria Collins?”

His voice was sexy and velvety.

He lowered his head and his eyes dropped to the exposed part of my bra. Maybe it was just my imagination, but the color of his eyes seemed to darken as he stared.

Wherever his gaze landed, my skin started burning up.

But wait.

How did he know my name?

Chapter 2 With Ex's Brother-in-law

Aria’s POV

Of course I recognized him. God, who didn’t?

I’d met him at the Apex gala. His face was on every finance magazine cover, and any time you turned on a TV, there he was—linked to the latest scandal with some actress or model.

But there was no way he’d know who I was.

“I-I…Hello, Alpha Grayson,” I stammered.

He turned his eyes away and said to a nearby guard, “Escort Ms. Collins out.”

“Yes, Alpha.”

The guards stepped in immediately, stretching out their arms like I was some kind of contaminant that might taint Grayson’s perfectly tailored suit.

“Wait a minute. You’re not going to say something about my shirt?” It’s torn beyond repair and was showing my breasts.

He paused. Just for a brief second. Then flicked something down at my feet.

I looked down. A blank check.

“I need a shirt that can cover my front. Not your hush money.” I gritted with humiliation.

But he didn’t even glance back and just walked away.

“God,” I muttered under my breath.

Can you believe these rich bastards?

They think they can buy everything with money.

People nearby were all staring, snickering under their breath. I tried to cover my chest and grab my things to escape, but it was hard to do all that with just two hands.

“Oh my god…Aria Collins?”

Three girls emerged from the whispering crowd. I took one look at them and sighed internally.

Great. Just when I thought today couldn’t get any worse.

“Hello. Layla. Sabrina. Brielle.” I said dryly.

I used to work in the same team with these girls back at Apex. We were all under Jace.

These girls adored Jace. They spent more time flirting with him by the coffee machine than actually working. Which left me doing most of their work.

After I got fired, and when news of my secret relationship with Jace got out, they decided I was public enemy number one.

“What are you even doing here, Aria? Trying to win back your ex at his wedding? That’s a new low even for you,” Layla snickered.

“I’m not here to win anyone back.” I tried to push past them.

But they blocked me.

“What happened to your shirt?” Brielle snickered. “Did you seriously walk in here with your bra out? Is this like some low-budget fashion statement?”

They burst into laughter together.

“You could be completely naked and Jace still wouldn’t give a damn,” Sabrina squeaked. “Because he’s marrying Lady Delilah. THE Delilah Hart! Redstone Pack’s sweetheart. And you…well you’re just a poor-ass small-town girl.”

I stopped in my track and gave them a cold glare, “Oh yeah? Well at least this smalltown girl actually dated Jace. And you all got nothing. Do you know how many times I had to listen to him complained about your screechy voices and cheesy perfume after we got home? Apparently he rather be with me than any of you.”

Their jaws dropped.

“Jace would never say that!” Brielle cried.

“And my perfume isn’t cheesy!” Sabrina screamed.

“Word for word,” I rolled my eyes. “Now move. Or I’m rolling this suitcase over your pretty little skirts.”

They looked like ruffled chickens, but they parted. I quickly shoved my dingy luggage ahead like a weapon and stormed out of the church.

Rich people were assholes.

Grayson, Jace, and their whole damn minions.

I struggled to get my suitcase down the steps, and once I hit the street, cold wind slapped me in the face.

It’s almost night. But I had no idea where to go.

I could crash in the hospital with my grandma, but she’d ask too many questions. Like why I hadn’t brought Jace around recently, or why I wasn’t staying at my apartment. I didn’t want her to know how bad things had gotten.

I thought about the park. Sleeping on a bench. But in a ripped T-shirt that exposed my whole front? Horrible idea.

So I texted my best friend, May, asking to stay at her place for a few days. She was my rock. If the whole world turned against me, at least I still had her.

She texted back right away inviting me to come over.

Dragging my suitcase across the street toward the bus stop, I told myself it was going to be okay. This horrible day was going to end.

Then I heard them.

“Hey, nice shirt!”

A group of street wolves were loitering near the stop.

I hugged myself tighter and curled into the bench, hoping they’d get bored and leave.

“C’mon baby, drop your hands. Let us see what you’re working with.”

Go away. Go away. Go away.

“You rip that shirt yourself? Damn that’s wild. I like that in a girl.” One of them moved closer, reaching for my shoulder.

“Fuck off!” I snapped, my voice shaking.

But it only fired them up.

“Oh, feisty. Shake those tits for me!”

They grabbed my wrists, yanked my arms down. My T-shirt gaped open completely, revealing my lace bra. The cold air made my skin pebble. They laughed even louder.

I struggled and screamed. My wolf growled in rage.

Shifting in the city was illegal…but right now, I didn’t have a second choice…

Just then. Blinding headlights. Followed by screeching tires.

A silver car skidded to a stop inches away.

The door flew open. A deep voice thundered:

“Get in.”

I was too shocked that I didn’t think twice and obeyed. The car peeled away the second I shut the door.

“My suitcase!” I cried.

“Someone will get it,” he said darkly. “Address.”

I told the driver May’s, my body still shaking. Then he pressed a button. A privacy screen slid up between the front and back seats, sealing us in the back.

That’s when he turned toward me and leaned in. Like a beast ready to pounce.

His scent hit me. It’s sharp pine mixed with cold metal.

My head started to get dizzy.

“Walking on the street in that shirt was a mistake,” he said darkly.

“It got like this because of you,” I mumbled.

He snorted.

Then there’s the sound of rustling fabric. A heavy jacket landed across my shoulders. It was still warm from his body and carried his scent.

I held my breath.

Wearing his coat almost felt like…he was wrapping himself around me.

“Alpha Grayson…do you know me?” I whispered.

My gut told me that he would never do this for a strange girl. But if he knew who I was, he must know that I was his sister’s husband’s ex. That didn’t explain why he would help.

“We’ve met,” he said simply.

I stared at him, searching those icy gray eyes. He was staring at me too, with those cold, hungry, possessive eyes. I felt like I was completely naked in front of him.

“Aria,” he warned, voice thick and husky.

But I couldn’t control myself.

I was leaning forward.

Shit. Why did my body become so weird?

My skin was on fire. My panties were wet. All I wanted was more of his scent. More of his heat.

The next second his lips crashed onto mine. Hard. Rough.

I gasped and opened my mouth for him. His tongue slipped in and explored every inch of my mouth, making me shiver. His hands pushed into my torn shirt and grabbed my breast. I couldn’t control my moan when he touched my naked skin.

This…This was crazy.

He was a stranger, and most importantly, my ex’s brother-in-law.

And I was making out with him at the back of his car.

The crazy part was I didn’t even want to stop.

He lifted me onto his lap like I weighed nothing. I straddled his thighs and yanked at his tie as he bit my collarbone.

Then, suddenly, the car stopped.

“Alpha, we’ve arrived,” the driver said behind the screen.

That’s when it all froze.

His lips paused at my neck. I was still squirming on his lap, flushed and throbbing. But he shoved me off.

“We can’t do this,” he said coldly.

Chapter 3 You're Special To Him

Aria’s POV

“So you’re telling me this guy made out with you in the backseat of his car… and then just shoved you off like nothing happened?” May asked in shock.

20 minutes later, I was sitting at her place, wrapped in one of her oversized hoodies, a steaming mug of tea in my hands.

But I was still reeling from everything that had just happened.

“Yup,” I muttered. “Who knows what’s wrong with him.”

“What an asshole,” she huffed. “But honestly, this really isn’t like you. You dated that jerk Jace for 4 years and didn’t even sleep with him—which, by the way, was a brilliant choice—and now you're suddenly making out with a complete stranger in his car?”

I opened my mouth but had no idea what to say. Yeah, she had a point.

“I—I don’t know. Maybe it was the whole Jace-getting-married thing. Maybe I just snapped and wanted to screw around with someone hotter just to get back at him…Honestly, it was so stupid now that I think of it.”

She grinned and wiggled her brows. “So… he was hot huh?”

My cheeks flushed and my mind drifted back.

Those stormy gray eyes, his perfectly shaped lips on my neck, and those arms that could pick me up like I weighed nothing…Shit I need to stop.

“Yeah. VERY,” I whispered, hiding my red face behind the mug.

May burst out laughing. “Now we’re talking! That’s exactly what you need right now—a drop-dead gorgeous rebound to get that loser Jace out of your system. Screw your ‘no sex before marriage’ rule. Life is short.”

I gave her a weak smile.

Honestly, I didn’t need a rebound. I needed a job, money, and a place to live. Grayson Hart was like dessert when you can’t even afford dinner.

“So… do you even know who this guy was?” she asked.

I hesitated. Right at this moment, the doorbell rang.

She jumped up to get it and came back a few minutes later, hauling in my luggage, her face frozen in disbelief.

“OMG. You are not gonna believe what just showed up outside.”

“Umm… my luggage?” I joked.

“Two fucking muscular guys in black suits and guns! And a freaking stretch limo! They called me ‘ma’am’ and said they hope Miss Aria has a wonderful evening. Now, you—”

She leapt at me and shook me by the shoulders.

“—you tell me right now who the hell you hooked up with!”

I squealed and dropped into the couch with her, laughing and giggling breathlessly.

“Okay, okay—I’ll tell you. It was… Grayson Hart.”

I practically whispered his name.

Because honestly, I still couldn’t believe it either.

May froze, eyes wide as saucers. “Grayson—THE Grayson Hart?! As in our Alpha? The CEO of Apex?!”

“And Jace’s soon-to-be brother-in-law. Now you know how stupid I was earlier?”

She let out a full-on scream. Then she grabbed my hand, her face flushed with excitement. “Oh my God! Aria, do you know what this means? Alpha Grayson never even lends his jacket to his model girlfriends. He likes you. You’re special!”

“No,” I said firmly. “If I was special, he wouldn’t have thrown me off his lap when I tried to take off his shirt.”

“Maybe he had somewhere to be—”

“Don’t, May. Let’s be real. Guys like him don’t fall for girls like me.” I took another sip of tea, hiding the ache in my chest.

Hell even Jace thought I was beneath him.

What chance did I have with Grayson freaking Hart?

“Don’t be silly, Aria. You’re gorgeous. And smart and amazing and—WAIT! I just had the best idea ever.”

“What?”

“That arrogant jerk Jace thinks you’re just some small-town prude who wasn’t good enough for him right? But what if you ended up with Alpha Grayson? It’ll be easy to get him because he’s already obsessed. Oh, it would destroy Jace. That dickhead would never recover.”

OKAY.

I’d be lying if I said that exact scenario hadn’t crossed my mind when Grayson kissed me back.

What girl hasn’t daydreamed about dating the perfect guy and getting revenge in the most dramatic way possible?

But right now, I couldn’t afford to daydream. Reality was already breathing down my neck.

“Tempting. But right now I need a job and enough cash to keep Grandma in her hospital bed. Dating rich dudes isn’t exactly high on my to-do list.”

May looked at me with soft eyes. “So…any plans? I can try to hook you up with a job, but you know I just work at a coffee shop, and with your degree, you deserve so much more.”

I hugged her. “Thank you. Really. I’ll figure something out. Apex promised me severance when they fired me, so I’m going to HR tomorrow to get it sorted.”

If I could get that money, at least I’d be OK for the next round of Grandma’s medical bills.

—

The next morning, I showed up at Apex right on time.

But the second Brielle walked in with the HR manager, I had a bad feeling.

“What’s she doing here?” I asked coldly.

“I’ll explain in a minute,” HR replied with a polite, rehearsed smile as she sat across from me. “So Ms. Collins, I understand you’re here to discuss severance?”

1qmbmiv,https://i.redd.it/rzwmg55zwffg1.png,In Bed With My Ex’s Brother-In-Law,"Chapter 1 He Left For A Rich Girl

I stood in front of the chapel.

Pink roses and white lilies decorated every corner. My favorite flowers.

The guests were already seated. Soon, at the end of the red carpet would stand the man I once loved, waiting to marry his bride.

Everything was perfect.

Except I wasn't the bride.

“I really need to see Jace today.”

I begged the bodyguard blocking the door. A beat-up suitcase and two boxes sat at my feet. Everything I owned in the world.

""No you don’t. Get out of here,"" the bodyguard said icily.

I saw disgust in his eyes. Yeah I get it. No one has sympathy for the crazy ex who shows up at the wedding.

But I have my reason to be here.

""If you don't let me see him, I'll just stand here and all the guests will see me,"" I threatened under my breath.

Jace wouldn't want that. Especially not today.

Because today, he was marrying Delilah Hart.

She is the sister to Alpha Grayson Hart of Redstone Pack. A 100% high-society darling.

All the guys in the world knew that marrying Delilah would totally change their lives, including Jace.

So he made the easy call—marrying the lady who could turn him from a small-town nobody into a golden boy. And dump the girl who stayed by his side for last 4 years when he had nothing.

He didn’t want any guests to see me here. Because I represented his broke, embarrassing past. He wanted me nowhere near his glittering new world.

Tears stung my eyes as I thought of that. Like a knife was twisting in my chest.

“Let me in or I’m starting to yell.” I choked.

The bodyguard frowned. ""Wait here.""

He finally called somebody. A few minutes later, he waved me in.

I wiped my eyes and struggled into the hall with my suitcase and boxes.

Instantly, I felt out of place.

Everything reeked of wealth here. Expensive perfume. Manicured nails. Not a hair out of place. It was everything you imagined about the upper-class and way more.

And me?

I was wearing a baggy T-shirt and jeans. My sneakers had holes.

""God, a homeless. She stinks."" A woman mutter as I walked by.

No it couldn’t be. I just showered this morning. My hair still smelled like strawberries and coconut.

But poverty had a scent, apparently.

""Mr. Carter is inside."" The guard took me to a closed door and warned, “Make it quick.”

“Thank you.”

The room inside looked like something out of a movie. Marble floors. White carpet. A chandelier that probably cost more than my apartment.

And there he was.

The man I used to love.

Adjusting his bowtie in front of a mirror.

Jace was still heartbreakingly handsome. No wonder Delilah fell for him.

When he turned and fixed his gorgeous blue eyes upon me, I still felt my heart race.

""Hey, Jace,"" I said quietly.

And immediately, I wanted to punch myself.

Hey, Jace?!

That’s the best I could do?

His face was ice cold.

""You shouldn't come, Aria.” he said with a frown. “Your ratty suitcase, your ripped jeans, your Vans. None of that belongs here.""

Well if you wanted to be brutal and vicious, that’s how it’s done.

""Don’t you think I deserve an explanation? You dumped me over a fucking email!"" I snapped.

He shrugged. ""Look around you. The wealthiest people in the world came for me today. This suit I’m wearing cost more than you can make in your entire life. What more explanation do you want?""

Wow.

I always knew he was a cold, calculating bastard.

I just didn’t realize how deep it ran.

""Maybe chasing Alpha’s sister got you here faster. But you know what? When she finds out how shallow and cold you are. You’ll lose it all.""

Anger flared across his face.

""I know how to love someone! I just won't waste that on a small-town girl like you.” he said freezingly, “Are we done here?""

“No.”

I took a deep breath and got into the real reason I came.

""You're marrying a rich girl. Fine. But why did you have to get me fired?""

Yeah. I used to work for this jerk.

From intern to full-time at Apex Corp, he was my supervisor.

Our office romance was a secret. And just days ago, I found out he was getting married with Apex CEO’s sister. And I was out of a job thanks to him.

""Right, your job.” The jerk shrugged, “You got your job all thanks to me. Now that I’m not around, maybe they finally saw how incompetent and stupid you are. Problem?""

Was he fucking kidding me?!

""I graduated top of my class. Made it through 7 rounds of interviews. My performance exceeded every quarterly target. I earned that job!"" I snapped.

“Come on, Aria. You really gonna be so naïve?”

He walked closer, smirking.

""You passed the interviews because I said so. Your sales? I contacted those customers for you. Without me, you'd be nothing but a pretty face.""

He seized my chin and looked me over with a disgusting look. I slapped his hand away.

""Give me my job back,” I hissed, my voice slightly trembling. “My dad’s debt. My grandma’s medical bills…I need the money. You of all people should know what it’s like to be poor. Don’t. Make. Me. Beg.""

I was throwing my pride at his feet.

But he just laughed.

""Well, how about I offer you a deal?"" he said as though he’d been waiting for this moment.

He brushed my hair back, fingers trailing down to my collarbone. I shivered in disgust.

""You and I. We never fuck. You were so clinging to that pathetic no-sex-before-marriage rule. Maybe it's time to grow up. Let me fuck you once and I’ll write you very handsome check. How does that sound?""

I widened my eyes in shock.

Then I slapped him. HARD.

“FUCKING HELL…What the hell are you doing?! I’m getting married in front of everyone in fucking 10 minutes!” He roared covering his swollen face.

""Fuck you, Jace!” I yelled, “You're a spineless freeloading puss! And hey—congrats on the wedding. Hope your junk is soft like a fucking spaghetti tonight!""

Then I stormed out dragging my suitcase and boxes, ignoring his angry curses behind me.

Hot tears poured down as I dashed across the hallway.

God this couldn’t be any worse.

I was prepared to drop all my self-esteem and begged with my life. Because I needed the job and money.

But I still let him get to me.

Now what do I do?

My salary barely covered my rent, my father’s debt and grandma’s bill. Now with my job gone, I already got kicked out by my landlord. I probably had to sleep in a park tonight.

So do I go back and let that jerk win? Let him humiliate me...No. I’d rather die than that…

""Hey, watch where you're going!"" someone yelled.

Too late.

I slammed right into the man in front of me.

He was tall. So tall I felt like I’d just walked into a brick wall.

His diamond cufflink was sharp like a blade. When we collided, it sliced clean through my thin T-shirt with a loud rip.

She grinned and wiggled her brows. “So… he was hot huh?”

My cheeks flushed and my mind drifted back.

Those stormy gray eyes, his perfectly shaped lips on my neck, and those arms that could pick me up like I weighed nothing…Shit I need to stop.

“Yeah. VERY,” I whispered, hiding my red face behind the mug.

May burst out laughing. “Now we’re talking! That’s exactly what you need right now—a drop-dead gorgeous rebound to get that loser Jace out of your system. Screw your ‘no sex before marriage’ rule. Life is short.”

I gave her a weak smile.

Honestly, I didn’t need a rebound. I needed a job, money, and a place to live. Grayson Hart was like dessert when you can’t even afford dinner.

“So… do you even know who this guy was?” she asked.

I hesitated. Right at this moment, the doorbell rang.

She jumped up to get it and came back a few minutes later, hauling in my luggage, her face frozen in disbelief.

“OMG. You are not gonna believe what just showed up outside.”

“Umm… my luggage?” I joked.

“Two fucking muscular guys in black suits and guns! And a freaking stretch limo! They called me ‘ma’am’ and said they hope Miss Aria has a wonderful evening. Now, you—”

She leapt at me and shook me by the shoulders.

“—you tell me right now who the hell you hooked up with!”

I squealed and dropped into the couch with her, laughing and giggling breathlessly.

“Okay, okay—I’ll tell you. It was… Grayson Hart.”

I practically whispered his name.

Because honestly, I still couldn’t believe it either.

May froze, eyes wide as saucers. “Grayson—THE Grayson Hart?! As in our Alpha? The CEO of Apex?!”

“And Jace’s soon-to-be brother-in-law. Now you know how stupid I was earlier?”

She let out a full-on scream. Then she grabbed my hand, her face flushed with excitement. “Oh my God! Aria, do you know what this means? Alpha Grayson never even lends his jacket to his model girlfriends. He likes you. You’re special!”

“No,” I said firmly. “If I was special, he wouldn’t have thrown me off his lap when I tried to take off his shirt.”

“Maybe he had somewhere to be—”

“Don’t, May. Let’s be real. Guys like him don’t fall for girls like me.” I took another sip of tea, hiding the ache in my chest.

Hell even Jace thought I was beneath him.

What chance did I have with Grayson freaking Hart?

“Don’t be silly, Aria. You’re gorgeous. And smart and amazing and—WAIT! I just had the best idea ever.”

“What?”

“That arrogant jerk Jace thinks you’re just some small-town prude who wasn’t good enough for him right? But what if you ended up with Alpha Grayson? It’ll be easy to get him because he’s already obsessed. Oh, it would destroy Jace. That dickhead would never recover.”

OKAY.

I’d be lying if I said that exact scenario hadn’t crossed my mind when Grayson kissed me back.

What girl hasn’t daydreamed about dating the perfect guy and getting revenge in the most dramatic way possible?

But right now, I couldn’t afford to daydream. Reality was already breathing down my neck.

“Tempting. But right now I need a job and enough cash to keep Grandma in her hospital bed. Dating rich dudes isn’t exactly high on my to-do list.”

May looked at me with soft eyes. “So…any plans? I can try to hook you up with a job, but you know I just work at a coffee shop, and with your degree, you deserve so much more.”

I hugged her. “Thank you. Really. I’ll figure something out. Apex promised me severance when they fired me, so I’m going to HR tomorrow to get it sorted.”

If I could get that money, at least I’d be OK for the next round of Grandma’s medical bills.

—

The next morning, I showed up at Apex right on time.

But the second Brielle walked in with the HR manager, I had a bad feeling.

“What’s she doing here?” I asked coldly.

“I’ll explain in a minute,” HR replied with a polite, rehearsed smile as she sat across from me. “So Ms. Collins, I understand you’re here to discuss severance?”

“Yes. So let’s not waste time. Just give me the check and I’ll be out of here.”

“Unfortunately, severance only applies when the company terminates a contract without cause. In your case… it appears you were let go due to misconduct.”

Misconduct?

What the freaking hell.

“Jace made a snap decision and booted me. What misconduct are you talking about?”

“But that’s not what Mr. Carter said. He provided evidence that you made a costly error on a sales quote—omitting a few zeroes, to be exact. Cost the company millions. Here’s the email record.”

She handed me a printed sheet.

I swore I had never sent this email in my life. But there it was—my name in the sender field.

No freaking way.

Jace forged this.

“And Mr. Carter reported that you had a difficult attitude toward your coworkers. Quote: ‘impatient and arrogant.’ Brielle’s here to verify that.”

Brielle twirled her hair and smiled smugly. “Yeah. Aria was a horrible team player.”

I stood so fast my chair screeched. “The only thing I didn’t ‘teamplayed’ with you was flirt with the boss in the breakroom!”

“Liar!” she yelled. “And I asked Jace. He never said my voice was screechy!”

Oh my God. I couldn’t believe how stupid she was.

“Sit down, Miss Collins,” HR warned. “As of now, not only are you not getting severance, but we’re also considering legal action to recover the losses. If you understand the situation here, sign this acknowledgement—”

“Does Alpha Grayson know about this?” I asked.

Both of them froze. After a long pause, HR finally found her voice. “What does Alpha Grayson have to do with any of this?”

“He owns Apex, doesn’t he? Does he know his team is abusing their power and firing hardworking employees illegally?”

HR frowned. Brielle let out a loud snort. “Please. Don’t act like you know Alpha Grayson.”

“What if I do? What if I go to him and then it’s you who gets fired?”

She laughed in my face. “Oh, you mean you know him on TV?”

“Let’s find out.”

I shoved my chair back and stormed out, heading straight for the CEO’s private elevator at the end of the hall. HR scrambled after me, shouting my name.

I was too furious to care how this ended. All I wanted now was to blow the whole damn place up.

Two guards stood by the elevator.

“I need to see Alpha Grayson,” I told them.

“Appointment?”

“No, but I swear he knows me. Just tell him it’s Aria—from yesterday. He’ll remember.”

“You aren’t the first girl here saying that,” one of them mocked.

“Come on, Miss Collins,” HR snapped, trying to drag me back. “This is getting crazy. Go back, sign the paper. Take responsibility for your own mistake.”

“I didn’t send that email. It was Jace—he’s framing me! I will report all of you.”

“Alpha Grayson doesn’t have time for your report, or your visit, or any of your little drama!”

“I believe no one but me has the right to decide that,” a cold voice said behind us.

Chapter 4 Take Me, Please

Aria’s POV

A large hand grabbed my arm and pulled me away from HR’s grip.

I looked up and my heart almost stopped.

Even I couldn’t believe he just showed up here. It felt like a dream.

“A-Alpha Grayson,” HR stammered, her face frozen with shock and fear.

“I don’t need employees who think they can make decisions for their boss,” he said freezingly while wrapping his arm around my waist. “If I see something like this again, you’re fired.”

“Y-yes, Alpha. I’m terribly sorry…”

HR’s expression was priceless, but I was in no mood to enjoy it. His icy pine scent consumed me again, making my body weak and hot. My wolf let out a soft purr, urging me to lean into him. But before I could even move, he let go.

A pang of disappointment hit me in the chest.

“Come,” he said shortly, striding toward the private elevator.

I shot HR and the stunned security guards a smug look, then hurried after him.

He swiped his card and the elevator doors closed. We started going up to the 58th floor.

It was dead silent. My heart was beating so wildly that I was afraid he’d hear it. I snuck a glance at him—he just stared straight ahead, emotionless, keeping a distance, like he wanted to be anywhere but here.

Unease twisted my stomach.

“So, um… what brings you here today?” I broke the silence.

He sighed softly. “I owe this company.”

“Oh, Oh…Right.”

I wanted to punch myself in the face.

The awkward silence lingered until the elevator dinged open. The 58th floor was a wide-open space with no cubicles or dividers—just massive floor-to-ceiling windows and a sweeping view of the entire city.

“Wow,” I whispered under my breath. Grayson was already walking ahead.

I jogged to catch up as he led me into an office at the far end of the floor. A stunning female assistant closed the door behind us, and once again, it was just the two of us. My heart rocketed back into my throat.

He casually unbuttoned his jacket. It was amazing how he made even that look sexy.

“So you insisted on seeing me?” he asked.

He didn’t ask me to sit. He didn’t even move closer. That distance stung a little.

“I worked here till a week ago when I found out I was let go for no reason…” I quickly told him the story of how I was fired. “This is clearly illegal in so many ways… can you help me get my job back?”

“Unfortunately, no,” he replied, barely hesitating.

My heart dropped like a stone. “Why not?”

“I’ll have the hiring department look into whether your termination followed proper protocol. But this isn’t something a CEO handles directly. Anything else?”

The hiring department?

That could take weeks—and I didn’t have weeks.

“No… you don’t get it,” I stepped forward, my voice trembling. “My grandma’s in the hospital. Her bills are getting insane every month. And I’m already deep in debt… If I can’t make money, I don’t even know— I really, REALLY need this job.”

I knew we came from two different worlds, but laying out the most desperate parts of my life in front of him still made me feel horribly exposed. I just hoped—begged—that he’d understand.

Here are some screenshots related to different real-life situations where I am unsure what the rules are. I have written down my understanding for each situation but would appreciate confirmation from the more experienced members of the community. 



[Scenario A - I always see cars only going left here, but I see no sign prohibiting right turns. Do you have any idea if I am missing something or are right turns allowed? ](https://preview.redd.it/7irdue1quffg1.jpg?width=3334&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed0f3ac5987ed635b50a7e48485b4c40fe86fb3d)

[Scenario B - if this car wanted to turn right, would it be allowed? Please look at the image below for birds eye view of road markings.  My understanding is that a right turn is allowed like a typical traffic light regulated road and you can cross the continuous solid line as you are moving from one road to another. But bird's eye view shows the road also has forward arrow and that confuses me.  ](https://preview.redd.it/glv0nzzouffg1.jpg?width=3366&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0be2fb312370785c52cdd54a8839c6a1e9c98f4f)

[Scenario C - Would this white car be allowed to do a U-Turn on this road? Look for Birdseye view below.

The individual would be my dad, and this again isn't the first time he has done something like this. I would be safe to get more evidence and I don't want to immediately wreck anything with anything rash. Both my mom and dad are good people, but this is severely inappropriate and grounds for a lot more, you don't have to be a bad person to do bad things.

The thing is, the past incident were inappropriate messaging and potential meetups, I was very young at the time but unfort my parents looped me in even so, which let's be real wasn't healthy for me. Now the texts span potentially multiple people in an unconventional social media ""locked"" app I was able to gain access to with a private messaging system embedded within.

Messages are as tame as good morning and good night texts with check ins on health to private outings on repeated occasions for movies, coffee, etc. in which more could be happening, and he is lying about being at work and usually leaves to work late and returns back home late as well. He has gaslit my mother multiple times before and has even resorted to violence against objects and her multiple times, granted with a LOT of effort he has mostly subsided as far as I know, and I have unfortunately threatened him that if he does anything to my mom again everyone in his circles would know about everything with plenty of proof.

He has gone to multiple events with groups of people esp with specific people he has had inappropriate relations with mostly over text and call without letting us know as a family or lying to us that it's a work thing etc, in which we find out later via social media, and lies also about specifically people being there even if we know he is going. All of this has been going on for about... 10 years now but apparently the issue itself of lying, poor management, violence, etc. has been common for much much longer than that. Again that's not relevant persay exactly to this exact thing but I need to get the context out.

I'm not gonna lie, I think it's still very safe for me to get evidence. Granted I won't look again for at least a few days, as I also want to make sure that there is new stuff to begin with to search for, even literally this evening he was talking to a lady, and I found out from the corner of my eye hence the new ""interest"" for lack of a better phrasing. He's usually not violent with me or my sibling, esp for many years. I do worry for my mom, hence I'm not telling either of them AT THE MOMENT.

For context too, my mom has always had a very up and down but in all honesty mostly down relationship with him, I suspect she does suffer from depression anxiety and trauma at times, but she has also had bad experience with doctors and therapists as he is very pro that and also likes to speak with them on a 1 on 1 basis and share more from his perspective. I admit as a kid at the time, I wasn't privy to a good amount of the details but both he and my mother have basically treated me like a third party slash therapist since I was about 9-10 ish.

As a result of all this, my mom feels quite alone a lot so I as her kid try to stay with her talk to her and stuff but there's only so much I can do especially as someone who will eventually move out. When my sibling is home alone like when I was in college a lot would happen and she would lock herself in her room esp when they're fighting, they yell a lot and occasionally get physical, but when they do if I'm home too we come out of our rooms and confront them or just be there and usually they stop when they see us but not always.. idk it's hard.

I'm not gonna pretend my mom is perfect though, she's been hurt a lot and she sometimes takes it out on me or my sibling, more my sister to be honest. My sister to be honest has had a rly rough life too and is likely acutely depressed at times, with tendencies to self harm, and I cannot lie but this kind of environment is rather conducive of that. I will not also lie and admit that I have been physical occasionally in the past, though very rarely. I need to be honest with myself. I would sometimes get rly mad at them too for fighting or they would fight with me and I would hit my head on a wall occasionally, and I get that's also bad from a health perspective. Anyways that's a lot. Haha.

I've talked to her tonight at least, and I've told her there's nothing she needs to worry about or anything, it's not her responsibility now or ever. I know she's had issues in the past with everything but I've reassured her I'll always be with her no matter what. I haven't hit my head in a long time. It's better now though.

Also from experience usually mom doesn't get mad at sister for things my dad does, but my mom tends to lump us all together or mostly my dad and sister, they're pretty similar in the sense my mom usually has to take care of everyone all the time with everything, my dad doesn't cook or clean or help with a lot of things usually, and both of them having work full time is rough too, esp hard jobs. Not to mention the stress with me having graduated college and now working full time myself now in a research lab.

My sister is in high school and is super stressed herself, not to mention a lot of the drama and friend and romantic situations and what not that comes with the time, and I know that also had a role in her depression too. I admit though when my mom gets upset like that she either completely shuts down or gets scarily mad, even to herself, and has threatened suicide multiple times, or moving back to where she's from by herself and never coming back.

I'm gonna be real, if this kind of thing surfaces I am extremely scared sometimes of things happening that I can't control. Also in my culture and just in general, even if my sister and I ""leave the house when things get bad"" it's always been this bad I can't lie. There's been so much worse in the past for a lot of things for many many years at this point. It sucks to say and admit but we're kinda just used to it. My sister has known this for her whole life now, it's not anything new. I don't even remember a time myself before all this, but I suspect it's been going on since the beginning.

One of my earliest memories is my mom physically sealing her mouth shut and I think hurting or threatening to hurt herself with a sharp object, again I don't remember the latter point, but she kept the seal on for a LONG time. If I call the police, like doesn't it raise the questions of like why didn't I call the police all the other times, and like what happens after that? I don't want to ruin stuff I know people say I'm not doing it or like it's not my fault but like I genuinely for all the shit that goes on am still grateful for the life I get to live right now, and I wouldn't do anything to change that... except maybe for the better. Lol if I could magically make everyone happy and keep things going the same way I would.

My mom would also always refuse to go to a therapist. I know it. She's extremely anti. My sister was going to therapy cause my dad's work paid for a few sessions but after that ran out she just stopped going cause my parents didn't rly care to do so anymore and my mom was already pretty anti mental doctor? We go to these religious classes and it's more a moral thing for me but there are religious aspects, but my parents are deeply religious. They teach lessons like don't be a dick and be nice have good thoughts words deeds etc do service for others but man it's rough when you see people learning about these things but not actually doing them.

Anyways the reason I bring it up is cause my mom even straight to my sister said that she doesn't need therapy she needs to just internalize the things she learns at the center for religious classes, even when I myself am trying to convince her that she needs it. My dad tries to be on my side for this, he's rather supportive when it comes to my sister, but he spins it too it like imply and even outright say that we should go back to the marriage counselor or the doctor or whatever and then it usually spirals into an argument again... that's a lot too.

Regarding support system, I do have my best friends from college who studied family dynamics and I feel comfortable to talk to maybe... 1 or 2 of them. But that's it. I don't know for my sister. She has me I guess? I don't think she talks to others too much about it, she has bad experience with sharing private things like her self harm and her friends.. not friends but they share with random others and then it's like a widely known thing, it's kinda awful. I hate them. My friends I mentioned also don't know that much at all. I haven't spoken to them about anything before really, and 1 of them just knows the family situation is hard to say the least.

TL;DR: Dad is cheating again (10-year pattern). Mom is suicidal, refuses therapy, and has a history of extreme breakdowns. Sister self-harms and is the target of Mom's anger.

Hey everyone 👋

Made this super simple Jalapeño Cheese Eggs for breakfast today.

Soft, creamy eggs with melted cheese and a gentle jalapeño kick — honestly didn’t expect it to taste this good.

Ingredients:

3–4 eggs

1 tbsp butter

2 tbsp grated cheddar (or any cheese you like)

Fresh jalapeño slices

Salt & black pepper

Chives or herbs (optional)

How I made it:

Melt butter on low heat (important for creamy eggs).

Whisk eggs with a pinch of salt.

Add eggs to the pan and stir slowly.

When eggs are almost set, add cheese.

Top with jalapeño slices and black pepper.

Turn off heat while still slightly soft.

Served it with toasted bread and coffee ☕

Aurora



I had never heard silence quite like the one that hung over Lupinhollow.



I leaned my forehead against the cold car window. Even through the glass, I could feel the woods pressing in—old and heavy. The trees weren’t like the ones in the city. They didn’t whisper; they towered. Dark pines rose on both sides of the road, so thick they blocked out the sun. It was just past noon, but it already looked like dusk.



Mom hummed quietly along with the radio. Some soft indie ballad. She tapped the steering wheel out of rhythm while Dad snored in the passenger seat, mouth open like a cave. He'd insisted on driving the first five hours of the trip and then passed out as soon as the road got twisty. Figures.



I pulled my hoodie tighter around my arms. August wasn't supposed to feel like October.



The welcome sign flashed by so fast I almost missed it.



Welcome to Lupinhollow—Est. 1812.



A Howling Good Time Awaits!



I snorted. ""Seriously?""



Mom just smiled, her eyes still on the winding mountain road. ""Local charm, baby.""



„Local cringe,“ I muttered.



But I wasn't really annoyed. Just…tired. Nervous, maybe. A little cold. Everything felt different today—the air, the trees, even the sunlight—and I didn't know if that was the town or just me.



We rounded a curve, and suddenly, like something out of a painting, the college came into view.



At first, I thought it was a castle. Out of nowhere, this massive stone building appeared through the trees, covered in ivy like something from a fantasy movie. It had tall, pointy roofs, old arches, and windows so thin they looked more like arrow slits than anything else. It wasn’t ugly—in fact, it was pretty cool—but it definitely didn’t look like any college I’d ever seen.



A chill ran down my neck.



""This is it,"" Mom said softly, ""Moonbound Academy.""



I wanted to ask why it is called that, but the words stuck in my throat. I didn't want to sound dumb, especially since they'd spent the last six weeks hyping this place up. ""Best-rated private boarding college in the region,"" Mom had said. “Top-tier academics, incredible wilderness programs, full scholarship—what’s not to love?”



I'd heard it all already. And yet now, sitting in the shadow of this dark, towering place, I had the sinking feeling that I'd missed something important.



„Looks more like a haunted monastery than a college,"" I murmured, only half-joking.



Dad woke up with a grunt and rubbed his face. „We here?“



Mom pulled into the lot and found a spot next to a bunch of other cars. Students were everywhere, dragging suitcases or tossing duffel bags over their shoulders. I was expecting classic prep school vibes—dress pants, cardigans, maybe some quiet kids with thick glasses and big books. But nope. Everyone looked like they’d just stepped off the set of some supernatural teen show. Lots of leather jackets, combat boots, and dark circles under their eyes like it was a fashion statement.



Some of them were laughing, sure—but not loudly.



And then I noticed something else.



They were staring at me.



Not in a new-girl kind of way. Not even in a 'who's she' way.



They stared like I was…off. Wrong. Something just out of place enough to make them squint.



I shifted in my seat.



""Don't overthink it,"" Mom said, glancing at me in the rearview mirror. „They're just curious.“



But they weren't looking at her. Or Dad. Just me.



Mom killed the engine. The silence that followed wasn't normal silence—it was alive. The kind that made your ears ring a little. I could hear the wind moving through the trees, like the whole forest was breathing.



""Come on, sweetheart,"" Dad said as he climbed out, stretching like he hadn't just spent hours snoring. ""Let's find the front office.“



I stepped out of the car, the gravel crunching under my sneakers. It was cooler here, even for August. Not cold, exactly, but the air had weight. I pulled my hoodie tighter, fingers fidgeting with the cuffs.



The students kept watching me as we walked by. Their faces didn’t really change. Some squinted, others just stared. I tried to smile at a girl with a silver braid and big boots.



She didn't smile back.



The main building towered above us. Its black stone covered in creeping ivy. Over the double doors, carved deep into the archway, were words in latin: Luna Vincit Omnia



""What's that mean?"" I asked, staring up at it.



Dad shrugged. ""Something about the moon freeing all. You know your mom took Latin in college, not me.“



He was wrong, but I didn't correct him. I'd seen the phrase before—in a brochure they gave us in the acceptance packet. The Moon conquers all.



I remember thinking it sounded ominous then. It still does now.



Inside, the entryway was somehow darker than outside. The lighting was dim, everything cast in this soft gold glow that made the shadows stretch longer than they should. The floor was stone, the ceilings high enough to echo, and the air smelled faintly of sage and something sharp—like iron or earth after rain.



A woman sat at the front desk, clacking away at a keyboard. She looked…distracted. Early thirties maybe, a coffee mug tucked between both hands, earbuds in like she hadn't noticed we were standing there.



""Uh, hi,"" Mom said gently.



The woman startled, tugged out one earbud, and smiled too wide. ""Oh! Hello! Sorry. You must be the Wells family. Aurora, right?“



„That's me,“ I said, lifting a hand in a tiny wave.



""Right, right. Okay, I've got you here…” She squinted at the screen. ""Aurora… Dorm 3B. Assigned roommates… four of them—wow, you're going to have a full house.”



She slid a manila folder across the desk toward me. ""This has your schedule, a campus map, and a few rule sheets. Someone from dorm 3 will meet you to show you around in a bit.“



""Thanks,"" I said, trying to peek at the paperwork inside the folder. The class names looked weird—Lunar Pathfinding, Pack Psychology, Advanced shifting theory. I blinked at the last one.



""Uh…shifting?""



The woman blinked. ""Mmm?"" Then her eyes widened. ""Oh! Oh no, wait. Did I—?“



Mom leaned forward, brows knit. „Is something wrong?“



""No! No, no, I just—uh, it's fine. Everything's in order.” She gave another too-bright smile and waved her hand. ""Welcome to Moonbound! You're going to love it here.“



I didn't believe her.



Neither did my mom, by the look on her face.



But before either of us could say anything, a tall, dark-haired guy stepped into the room.



And everything shifted.",1,1769322037.0,getnovelsfree,0,1.0,False
1qmbdir,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1qmbdir/unpopular_opinion_but_cold_brew_is_a_bit/,Unpopular opinion but cold brew is a bit overrated(and I really tried to like it),"I've made cold brew countless times in the past 3 years, and honestly, I think it's a little overrated.

I've messed around with different grind sizes, mostly on the coarser side, tried various coffee-to-water ratios, and even played with different brew times.

But nothing really hits the spot like an iced pour-over or an Aeropress.

It always tastes either slightly bitter or a bit under-extracted if I only brew it for, say, 10-12 hours.

It's like there's no sweet spot for a well-balanced flavor. 

Maybe that's just how it is, or maybe cold brew is only good when you mix it with other stuff, like ginger ale or tonic water and make a new drink out of it.

I don't know, maybe it's my personal opinion and you all really enjoy it, but I've made cold brew so many times, and I've never gotten it to taste as good as a regular iced coffee.",4,1769322026.0,IndiaCoffee,3,0.83,False
