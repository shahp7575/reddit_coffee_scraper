I'm going into my 5th week on estradot patch 25, 100mg prometrium daily, and vagifem. I was in my luteal phase when I started, had a period a week later which was only 5 days long instead of 14-19 days which has become my normal. I felt a big improvement really fast and got really excited. Zero hot flashes. Well now I'm back in luteal phase, if my period comes around 28 days which I have no idea if it will, then it would be due in a week. Last week I had a hot flash and it wasn't bad and it passed and I didn't think  much of it. But then a couple days later I had another. And now for the past 3 days I have had them every afternafteevening. The first couple weren't connected to caffeine as far as I can tell. Today's absolutely is. I started work at 4pm. Today I got halfway through my coffee and the hot flash started. Except now it's like the ones I had before HRT. I get flushed in the face, my ears are red and on fire. No sweat. Nothing below the neck. And it just won't stop.

I am pretty sure I will need to give up caffeine, except 2-3 weeks ago I could drink a coffee and not get a hot flash. I could also see this being something I need to expect during the 2nd half of my cycle. But does it mean I should ask to get my patch increased after I finish this box? I was prescribed 2 months to start. I also have an appointment to get a mirena on the 23rd that I had scheduled before starting HRT (booked 9 weeks in advance because that's the closest I could get). I have no idea if it's a good idea to switch  or not, I don't have a PCP or gynecologist and no one I have been able to ask has really clear advice. I just don't want to make the luteal hot flashes worse.

1nh46o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1nh46o0/the_lost_episode_of_hazbin_hotel/,The Lost Episode of Hazbin Hotel,"The Lost Episode of Hazbin Hotel

One of the most common criticisms of the first season of Hazbin Hotel was the rushed pacing. Eight episodes just wasn’t enough for all the subplots the show was juggling. What people don’t know is that there were originally nine episodes. They’ll never know how fortunate they are that they never experienced the ninth one. Only I and I alone, along with a couple dozen others, know what a terrible fate so many escaped. 

For now. 

I was an intern in the animation studios Bento Box Studio and Spindlehorse. I learned all the most valuable animation skills, such as how to go get coffee orders. Also how to throw most of the coffee in the dumpster later. The intangible benefits were good, as someone who’d been a fan of Hazbin Hotel since the pilot was posted to Youtube in 2019. One my favorites was being among the first to see the episodes of Hazbin Hotel in test screenings. I was thrilled to be allowed to sit in on the development of the show years before the general public had any idea where the story was going. You’d be surprised to learn just what a different show it was until very late in the process. I learned quickly to take the fact that not a single word of my feedback in any way impacted the development of the show as just part of the business. 

One particularly intriguing aspect of the show’s development that I was aware of yet knew frustratingly little about was the episode with the production code A06XX. No matter how many episodes were in development or how the events of the show were shuffled to accommodate the expansion and contraction of the first run, an episode with that production code was included in every document with a summary of season one. It was unchangingly right at the end, which bewildered me considering that the events that ultimately served as the climax of the first season were always an episode or two earlier. I didn’t have the connections to get anyone to leak me any answers. I didn’t see so much as a frame in a storyboard that I didn’t eventually learn went into another episode or one of their deleted scenes, but I didn’t get the faintest concrete hint of what happened in A06XX in advance. Who knew? Knowing how raunchy the show was, we considered that maybe it would be a special extra-NSFW episode and would be used to get people to buy a potential physical release, with content not too far from that orgy episode of The Boys. 

Answers came all too quickly in 2023. I remember it like it was yesterday, for it was the last day I believed the world made sense. Now I know that the fabric of reality is diaphanous and mildewed, with smoldering burn marks. 

We in the lower ranks had been told the show had roughly locked its final release cut, barring a few retakes and cleanups, except episode A06XX. That morning, though, we had received emails with the following message: 

“Report Screening Room 308 - 2:15 pm. Assembly cut A06XX.” 

I couldn’t believe that we were going to be given answers regarding this enigmatic episode, but I didn’t want to admit to any of my associates how out of the loop I was. So while we waited in the screening room, I leaned over to another intern and whispered “You’re not going to believe they go there.” Then I felt a tap on my shoulder, leaned over to the other, to see it was Molly the intern in coloring and cleanup, asking me with her eyes if I knew what we were in for. “No spoilers.” I responded. She sighed, then nodded. 

Half an hour late, the production manager and a few suits entered the room with a sheepish wave. After all, we were supposed to be one big overworked family. It surprised me that there were a few EMTs who came and sat with us, along with a few others who were entering data on tablets as if they were studying us. Next came some big guys who looked like they could be bar bouncers in suits who confiscated our phones and other potential recording devices. I dismissed this as corporate budget bloat in action. I wanted to make a good impression by just sitting patiently while eagerly anticipating the mysterious new episode. 

“Thanks for your patience and for all your hard work,” the production manager said. We’ve kept a tight lid on this one, and, well, I believe I can say with confidence that in a little over half an hour, you’ll see why.” With a slam, the door to the screening room burst open, and who should appear but Vivienne Mederano herself. I’d seen her around a bit, but I’d been warned to never make eye contact. Now she looked over all of us, the low tier functionaries, as if we were a crowd of the cutest puppies ever. 

“Hi!” she called, sounding much more enthusiastic than I’d ever seen her before, though admittedly that was only from afar during stressful periods. “I just- I’ve never been so excited to see an audience reaction before! Truth be told, I consider this episode- I wouldn’t dare call it my masterpiece! It’s my fucking life’s work!” 

I was surprised that she had kept any information about A06XX from leaking if she was so proud of it. In fact I was surprised she had not just blabbed about it herself. As someone with like ten dream animated shows kicking around in my head, I couldn’t criticize anyone for enthusiasm about the dream episode of their dream project becoming a reality. 

To my surprise, chairs were brought in for every employee not in the test audience and all of them were pointed at us instead of the screen, as if they wanted to watch our reaction rather than watch the episode with us. I’d seen night vision footage of test audiences before, but the idea of watching people watch an episode live was a new one to me. It was especially surprising how all the suits and non-test audience members popped on noise-cancelling headphones. I would have thought they’d want to hear us laughing or cheering. 

After a few minutes of everyone getting in place, the lights went down. Up came the classic Spindlehorse logo, and after it faded to black, nothing. Then more nothing for a bit.  

Nothing to see, anyway. What there was to hear was whispering. Not from us in the audience, but from the speakers. It was like ASMR by a man with a deep voice with a feminine voice layered atop it, separate tracks because it didn’t feel as if the whisperers were addressing or acknowledging each other. Then a third voice came in. A fourth. Fifth. Soon it was deafeningly loud, but to my surprise, I couldn’t put my hands over my ears. I tried, but my muscular control was so off that both hands missed my head by inches. Then my arms limply dropped to my sides. I couldn’t move my limbs or neck at all. I could just move my eyeballs enough to see everyone in the rows ahead of me was only motionlessly staring forward as well. 

As soon as I began to panic inwardly from my paralysis and the discomfort of the volume, the voices cut off. Up came an image of the character Charlie Morningstar in the lobby of her Hotel, but drawn in an uncomfortably photorealistic style. Despite being rendered in 2d, she looked like a human cosplayer. But one wearing a costume and makeup not for looking cute at a convention but like a H. R. Giger painting, complete with oversized red eyes, horns that tore the flesh of the forehead they’d extended from, and hideous fangs. Yet a sincerely concerned expression adorned her face.. 

“Everyone,” Charlie Morningstar said, sounding like Erica Hennigensen was providing the voice but filters had been applied to better replicate this character’s fanged mouth and misshapen head. “We’ve presented a fun, redeemable vision of Hell in hopes of providing you a good time. It’s time for the fun to end, and for you to see the truth, the tortuous reality of Hell.” 

The animation on the Morningstar character must have been an incredibly fluid 60 fps, for it was so uncannily skillful that I didn’t notice strikingly bright runes and sigils take shape around her until she finished speaking. The symbols looked as if they were created by tearing the screen instead of merely being part of the animation. I saw streaks of light splash on the walls around the screen. Even though I’d never seen them or any symbols like them before and never would have been the type to study such things, I found I knew what they said. I couldn’t bring myself to write or draw them now, even with a gun to my head. 

“If you ever thought you would like to visit our depiction of Hell, then come with me to the real thing.” With that, the uncannily animated Charlie Morningstar lifted her arm, and then reached out. I tasted copper in my mouth and my lungs froze up as the hand extended from off the screen. Faintly, I could see the shadow it cast on the production manager and the people in the rows ahead of me.

Unable to close my eyes or turn away, I could only watch as her hand with its glistening, whetted claws made right for me. I couldn’t even scream as it grabbed my cheeks. Then something entered my mouth and nostrils, as if fluid hands were flowing from the palm into me. I felt it slide down my throat, into my guts. I felt other hands climb up my head so that I could feel them sliding up against the inside of my skull. Fingers slid around the eye sockets, emerging out around them. As the digits clenched, claws dug into the flesh of my eyebrows. I snapped forward and out of my seat as if I were a rag doll. I couldn’t see anymore, but I could feel when I passed through the membrane of the screen, passing through the fourth wall as if it were no more solid than the surface of a raindrop. 

Behind the screen, in the Hell I’d been brought to, my vision did not return. Nevertheless I remained aware as I passed through the heat of a kiln so intense that I cooked to a crisp in seconds. I felt myself land and pass through teeming masses of worms, that consumed what had been my ruined flesh and into what soft innards remained. I passed through a layer of what I was aware was Hell without sight or smell, only through feel with nerves that were somehow still intact and sending my mind signals was hydrochloric acid. I was reduced to a slop of mass, a cloud suspended in liquid. 

I was then slurped through the fangs of some entity, the echoing obnoxious sound reaching ears which should have no longer existed. I sloshed over porous, cavernous surfaces. The heat returned, and I felt myself pulled in every direction until I was hundreds of meters tall and wide. My thoughts were invaded by another mind, another mindset. One which knew hatred I would never be capable of, which knew loss, regret, envy that it would have driven me insane to experience for half a second, which it would have taken millennia of life to be capable of. Then I felt myself leave that mind which had invaded mine through oily pores, then in the great heat, I rose into the air as vapor. Without senses, I somehow knew of the presence of Molly the clean-up intern drifting through me, and I knew all her innermost secrets, even those which trauma had concealed from her own conscious mind. 

For twenty-three minutes I drifted, my mind no longer my own, the whim of tortures I never would have thought possible, aware of presences that Herenymous Bosch would never have been able to depict if he’d spent two centuries trying. All was malevolence, all was pain, all was regret. All was endlessness. What was left of me had no mind with which to have a positive experience ever again, only to remember sources of joy as distant, meaningless things compared to the eternity of torment ahead.

Then I was back in that chair in the screening room, and I could blink and look around like normal. I remembered everything with perfect recall. I had experienced Hell, not merely had a near death experience but a passage through Perdition, and I didn’t feel a wound mark on me. I could see in the wide, hollow, glassy eyes of those around me that they all had too. Those who ran away madly screaming were particularly unsubtle about it. 

“Yes! We did it!” I became aware that Medrano had screamed as she leapt up, her fists pumping. “We totally showed everyone what Hell’s really like! The fundies are going to be sucking all our dicks for this one!” 

“I still don’t know how you did it,” the production manager said, standing up and sharing a big hug with her. 

“...How?” Was all that any of us could muster to say after a minute of silence, aside from the mutual congratulations and the EMTs providing first aid to a few who looked like they’d gone into cardiac arrest. Medrano got ahold of herself, and cleared her throat. 

“Practice, man, practice.” Medrano said, miming animation in the air. “ Took me a long time to learn how to animate those sigils by hand to perform the ritual. They say animation is the Illusion of Life, but if you really get on that grindset, you can create the Reality of Death.” With that she and the other executives exited, abuzz about the implications of their innovative, ground-and-mindbreaking feat of animation. 

Gradually, all the able-bodied of us who’d been through the ordeal shuffled out, leaving me for last, without any sense of where to go. As I passed by the entrance to the projection booth, the door opened. 

“Hey intern,” the projectionist said as he ran past, a hand over his bluetooth-filled ear. He dropped a case with horridly familiar runes etched on it in front of me. “That’s the only episode of A06XX. I got family shit, go deliver it to the corporate, and make damn sure nothing happens to it.” 

“Okay,” I said in a monotone zombie voice, reaching for it as only my years of conditioning could compel me to do. The projectionist seemed satisfied to leave it with me in a huff. 

I try not to be a bitter person, but in this case, I couldn’t help it. All I can say is that I somehow managed to lose that case somewhere between the projection room and the corporate office and inside a dumpster that somehow caught fire. I got in a lot of trouble, but they couldn’t make a case against me, so the main consequence was I lost college credits. Apparently there just wasn’t time to recreate the lost episode to meet the deadlines, and the show was released to stream without A06XX. I can only hope that the episode will never be recreated. I can only hope it was some sort of strange illusion, and that there isn’t really a Hell, one so far unlike the one depicted in the one for which I worked as an intern. But my hopes are not high that I only experienced some particularly horrendous version of the Illusion of Life. When I returned home, I found there were brand new scratches cut though both of my eyebrows. 

I also hope this doesn’t count as a violation of my NDA. ",1,1757887077.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I kinda feel like im going crazy here. Im 17, he is 19 (met when I was 16 and he was 17) and have been together for a little over a year. We live about an hour away from eachother so we dont see eachother alot. He has adhd and him being forgetful is one of many issues we have had for most of our relationship. Earlier on i tried to communicate these issues but was just told he's sorry and doesn't know what to do every time I brought it up. I did try and offer ways to help but he shot down everything I came up with. I think i just lost trust in him and... yeah. But around two weeks ago I just kinda hit my breaking point and exploded. Wasn't my finest moment but I just could not continue like things were. I was crying and word vomiting for probably around an hour and told him that I dont feel important or loved in this relationship and haven't been for a while. It actually got alot better until this i mean he was making time for me and calling me earlier every night (he would call me around 12 - 3 sometimes later and I'd be basically passing out) and started calling me gorgeous and pretty again too. Idc if it sounds stupid that stuff is important to me. If it adds any context I have autism and adhd. Sorry for all the bavkstory I just wanted to add a lil context but now onto what happened yesterday.
So he's at a friend's family members house for the weekend to watch a cat. I texted him around 10 pm then I cleaned and took a shower. I got out around 1 am check my phone he still hasn't texted but I can see it was read. Maybe he just got distracted right? I check his location and he's in a random house. Idk why I went on instagram but when I did one of the girls he follows posted her location and she is at the SAME HOUSE. I called him and asked him what he was doing and he casually says hes hanging out with (girls name) and her brother. I chewed him out and told him I think he should leave and he agrees. I ask who he's getting a ride from? The girl. I was so pissed and I think he knew it because he ended up walking home. I know he knows he fucked up because all he could give me was basically one word answers. The girls brother added me and sent a big text saying nothing happened. He told me he didnt touch her but I have this horrible gut feeling. I mean he was in her house watching movies with her and driving around for 3 hours. Even if he didn't do anything he essentially went on a date with a girl and didnt think to text me. he says he just forgot to. He doesn't see how wierd this is and thinks the only thing he did wrong was not telling me. Last night on the phone he kept just saying sorry and that he loves me and then talking about random stuff like nothing happened. Then saying how he's stupid and hitting himself in the head. And he told me he's invited to go to a coffee shop with her tomorrow. I told him I didnt like that but I cant control him. Now today he went to the coffee shop and is now currently in her house again not answering after he said he'd text me and lmk whats happening. Im so unbelievably pissed, angry, upset and sad. I dont understand how he doesn't see how much this hurts me. I feel so disrespected. I was showering and cleaning thinking he was home when in reality he was running around with some girl he says was his best friend in 7th grade. Im really thinking about leaving but I love him so much he was my first everything he made me comfortable in my own body he knows things about me that nobody else does and sometimes he is really good at listening but im so tired of being treated like this.

1nh4137,https://www.reddit.com/r/hazbin/comments/1nh4137/the_lost_episode_of_hazbin_hotel/,The Lost Episode of Hazbin Hotel,"The Lost Episode of Hazbin Hotel



One of the most common criticisms of the first season of Hazbin Hotel was the rushed pacing. Eight episodes just wasn’t enough for all the subplots the show was juggling. What people don’t know is that there were originally nine episodes. They’ll never know how fortunate they are that they never experienced the ninth one. Only I and I alone, along with a couple dozen others, know what a terrible fate so many escaped. 



For now. 



I was an intern in the animation studios Bento Box Studio and Spindlehorse. I learned all the most valuable animation skills, such as how to go get coffee orders. Also how to throw most of the coffee in the dumpster later. The intangible benefits were good, as someone who’d been a fan of Hazbin Hotel since the pilot was posted to Youtube in 2019. One my favorites was being among the first to see the episodes of Hazbin Hotel in test screenings. I was thrilled to be allowed to sit in on the development of the show years before the general public had any idea where the story was going. You’d be surprised to learn just what a different show it was until very late in the process. I learned quickly to take the fact that not a single word of my feedback in any way impacted the development of the show as just part of the business. 



One particularly intriguing aspect of the show’s development that I was aware of yet knew frustratingly little about was the episode with the production code A06XX. No matter how many episodes were in development or how the events of the show were shuffled to accommodate the expansion and contraction of the first run, an episode with that production code was included in every document with a summary of season one. It was unchangingly right at the end, which bewildered me considering that the events that ultimately served as the climax of the first season were always an episode or two earlier. I didn’t have the connections to get anyone to leak me any answers. I didn’t see so much as a frame in a storyboard that I didn’t eventually learn went into another episode or one of their deleted scenes, but I didn’t get the faintest concrete hint of what happened in A06XX in advance. Who knew? Knowing how raunchy the show was, we considered that maybe it would be a special extra-NSFW episode and would be used to get people to buy a potential physical release, with content not too far from that orgy episode of The Boys. 



Answers came all too quickly in 2023. I remember it like it was yesterday, for it was the last day I believed the world made sense. Now I know that the fabric of reality is diaphanous and mildewed, with smoldering burn marks. 



We in the lower ranks had been told the show had roughly locked its final release cut, barring a few retakes and cleanups, except episode A06XX. That morning, though, we had received emails with the following message: 



“Report Screening Room 308 - 2:15 pm. Assembly cut A06XX.” 



I couldn’t believe that we were going to be given answers regarding this enigmatic episode, but I didn’t want to admit to any of my associates how out of the loop I was. So while we waited in the screening room, I leaned over to another intern and whispered “You’re not going to believe they go there.” Then I felt a tap on my shoulder, leaned over to the other, to see it was Molly the intern in coloring and cleanup, asking me with her eyes if I knew what we were in for. “No spoilers.” I responded. She sighed, then nodded. 



Half an hour late, the production manager and a few suits entered the room with a sheepish wave. After all, we were supposed to be one big overworked family. It surprised me that there were a few EMTs who came and sat with us, along with a few others who were entering data on tablets as if they were studying us. Next came some big guys who looked like they could be bar bouncers in suits who confiscated our phones and other potential recording devices. I dismissed this as corporate budget bloat in action. I wanted to make a good impression by just sitting patiently while eagerly anticipating the mysterious new episode. 



“Thanks for your patience and for all your hard work,” the production manager said. We’ve kept a tight lid on this one, and, well, I believe I can say with confidence that in a little over half an hour, you’ll see why.” With a slam, the door to the screening room burst open, and who should appear but Vivienne Mederano herself. I’d seen her around a bit, but I’d been warned to never make eye contact. Now she looked over all of us, the low tier functionaries, as if we were a crowd of the cutest puppies ever. 



“Hi!” she called, sounding much more enthusiastic than I’d ever seen her before, though admittedly that was only from afar during stressful periods. “I just- I’ve never been so excited to see an audience reaction before! Truth be told, I consider this episode- I wouldn’t dare call it my masterpiece! It’s my fucking life’s work!” 



I was surprised that she had kept any information about A06XX from leaking if she was so proud of it. In fact I was surprised she had not just blabbed about it herself. As someone with like ten dream animated shows kicking around in my head, I couldn’t criticize anyone for enthusiasm about the dream episode of their dream project becoming a reality. 



To my surprise, chairs were brought in for every employee not in the test audience and all of them were pointed at us instead of the screen, as if they wanted to watch our reaction rather than watch the episode with us. I’d seen night vision footage of test audiences before, but the idea of watching people watch an episode live was a new one to me. It was especially surprising how all the suits and non-test audience members popped on noise-cancelling headphones. I would have thought they’d want to hear us laughing or cheering. 



After a few minutes of everyone getting in place, the lights went down. Up came the classic Spindlehorse logo, and after it faded to black, nothing. Then more nothing for a bit.  



Nothing to see, anyway. What there was to hear was whispering. Not from us in the audience, but from the speakers. It was like ASMR by a man with a deep voice with a feminine voice layered atop it, separate tracks because it didn’t feel as if the whisperers were addressing or acknowledging each other. Then a third voice came in. A fourth. Fifth. Soon it was deafeningly loud, but to my surprise, I couldn’t put my hands over my ears. I tried, but my muscular control was so off that both hands missed my head by inches. Then my arms limply dropped to my sides. I couldn’t move my limbs or neck at all. I could just move my eyeballs enough to see everyone in the rows ahead of me was only motionlessly staring forward as well. 



As soon as I began to panic inwardly from my paralysis and the discomfort of the volume, the voices cut off. Up came an image of the character Charlie Morningstar in the lobby of her Hotel, but drawn in an uncomfortably photorealistic style. Despite being rendered in 2d, she looked like a human cosplayer. But one wearing a costume and makeup not for looking cute at a convention but like a H. R. Giger painting, complete with oversized red eyes, horns that tore the flesh of the forehead they’d extended from, and hideous fangs. Yet a sincerely concerned expression adorned her face.. 



“Everyone,” Charlie Morningstar said, sounding like Erica Hennigensen was providing the voice but filters had been applied to better replicate this character’s fanged mouth and misshapen head. “We’ve presented a fun, redeemable vision of Hell in hopes of providing you a good time. It’s time for the fun to end, and for you to see the truth, the tortuous reality of Hell.” 



The animation on the Morningstar character must have been an incredibly fluid 60 fps, for it was so uncannily skillful that I didn’t notice strikingly bright runes and sigils take shape around her until she finished speaking. The symbols looked as if they were created by tearing the screen instead of merely being part of the animation. I saw streaks of light splash on the walls around the screen. Even though I’d never seen them or any symbols like them before and never would have been the type to study such things, I found I knew what they said. I couldn’t bring myself to write or draw them now, even with a gun to my head. 



“If you ever thought you would like to visit our depiction of Hell, then come with me to the real thing.” With that, the uncannily animated Charlie Morningstar lifted her arm, and then reached out. I tasted copper in my mouth and my lungs froze up as the hand extended from off the screen. Faintly, I could see the shadow it cast on the production manager and the people in the rows ahead of me.



Unable to close my eyes or turn away, I could only watch as her hand with its glistening, whetted claws made right for me. I couldn’t even scream as it grabbed my cheeks. Then something entered my mouth and nostrils, as if fluid hands were flowing from the palm into me. I felt it slide down my throat, into my guts. I felt other hands climb up my head so that I could feel them sliding up against the inside of my skull. Fingers slid around the eye sockets, emerging out around them. As the digits clenched, claws dug into the flesh of my eyebrows. I snapped forward and out of my seat as if I were a rag doll. I couldn’t see anymore, but I could feel when I passed through the membrane of the screen, passing through the fourth wall as if it were no more solid than the surface of a raindrop. 



Behind the screen, in the Hell I’d been brought to, my vision did not return. Nevertheless I remained aware as I passed through the heat of a kiln so intense that I cooked to a crisp in seconds. I felt myself land and pass through teeming masses of worms, that consumed what had been my ruined flesh and into what soft innards remained. I passed through a layer of what I was aware was Hell without sight or smell, only through feel with nerves that were somehow still intact and sending my mind signals was hydrochloric acid. I was reduced to a slop of mass, a cloud suspended in liquid. 



I was then slurped through the fangs of some entity, the echoing obnoxious sound reaching ears which should have no longer existed. I sloshed over porous, cavernous surfaces. The heat returned, and I felt myself pulled in every direction until I was hundreds of meters tall and wide. My thoughts were invaded by another mind, another mindset. One which knew hatred I would never be capable of, which knew loss, regret, envy that it would have driven me insane to experience for half a second, which it would have taken millennia of life to be capable of. Then I felt myself leave that mind which had invaded mine through oily pores, then in the great heat, I rose into the air as vapor. Without senses, I somehow knew of the presence of Molly the clean-up intern drifting through me, and I knew all her innermost secrets, even those which trauma had concealed from her own conscious mind. 



For twenty-three minutes I drifted, my mind no longer my own, the whim of tortures I never would have thought possible, aware of presences that Herenymous Bosch would never have been able to depict if he’d spent two centuries trying. All was malevolence, all was pain, all was regret. All was endlessness. What was left of me had no mind with which to have a positive experience ever again, only to remember sources of joy as distant, meaningless things compared to the eternity of torment ahead.



Then I was back in that chair in the screening room, and I could blink and look around like normal. I remembered everything with perfect recall. I had experienced Hell, not merely had a near death experience but a passage through Perdition, and I didn’t feel a wound mark on me. I could see in the wide, hollow, glassy eyes of those around me that they all had too. Those who ran away madly screaming were particularly unsubtle about it. 



“Yes! We did it!” I became aware that Medrano had screamed as she leapt up, her fists pumping. “We totally showed everyone what Hell’s really like! The fundies are going to be sucking all our dicks for this one!” 



“I still don’t know how you did it,” the production manager said, standing up and sharing a big hug with her. 



“...How?” Was all that any of us could muster to say after a minute of silence, aside from the mutual congratulations and the EMTs providing first aid to a few who looked like they’d gone into cardiac arrest. Medrano got ahold of herself, and cleared her throat. 



“Practice, man, practice.” Medrano said, miming animation in the air. “ Took me a long time to learn how to animate those sigils by hand to perform the ritual. They say animation is the Illusion of Life, but if you really get on that grindset, you can create the Reality of Death.” With that she and the other executives exited, abuzz about the implications of their innovative, ground-and-mindbreaking feat of animation. 



Gradually, all the able-bodied of us who’d been through the ordeal shuffled out, leaving me for last, without any sense of where to go. As I passed by the entrance to the projection booth, the door opened. 



“Hey intern,” the projectionist said as he ran past, a hand over his bluetooth-filled ear. He dropped a case with horridly familiar runes etched on it in front of me. “That’s the only episode of A06XX. I got family shit, go deliver it to the corporate, and make damn sure nothing happens to it.” 



“Okay,” I said in a monotone zombie voice, reaching for it as only my years of conditioning could compel me to do. The projectionist seemed satisfied to leave it with me in a huff. 



I try not to be a bitter person, but in this case, I couldn’t help it. All I can say is that I somehow managed to lose that case somewhere between the projection room and the corporate office and inside a dumpster that somehow caught fire. I got in a lot of trouble, but they couldn’t make a case against me, so the main consequence was I lost college credits. Apparently there just wasn’t time to recreate the lost episode to meet the deadlines, and the show was released to stream without A06XX. I can only hope that the episode will never be recreated. I can only hope it was some sort of strange illusion, and that there isn’t really a Hell, one so far unlike the one depicted in the one for which I worked as an intern. But my hopes are not high that I only experienced some particularly horrendous version of the Illusion of Life. When I returned home, I found there were brand new scratches cut though both of my eyebrows. 



I also hope this doesn’t count as a violation of my NDA.

What a lot of us are just learning now is a big part of it is based on our incessant need for dopamine. The laughs we get from our classmates, the energy release from hyperactive exertion, the addictive cycles, are all expressions of our chase for higher and higher levels of dopamine.

Unfortunately, there are less than desireable results. It leaves us distracted, not living to our highest potential, constantly yo-yo-ing to different interests and projects without finishing anything meaning.

We're often wondering why the things that seem so simple for everyone else are a constant battle. Putting the milk in the cupboard, losing your morning coffee, walking outside with your buttons mismatched, leaving a car door open, or our home unlocked all day.

But this isnt just ADHD thing anymore. We live in a high stimulus world and many of us are hooked on products, substances or digital devices, that are designed to light up our dopamine receptors so profoundly that it makes every day life or even really special moments seem dull in comparison and too much work.

There's a few simple strategies you can incorporate in this book, as well as a few funny (and slightly embarrassing) stories from my awkward hyperactive childhood.

I am training with a local running group and we have completed 2 half marathon distances so far. They are fairly hilly, about 800 ft elevation gain. I would say I’m a pretty heavy sweater. Each time I’m done I am nauseous for hours.

My typical fueling looks like:
Night before: dinner with rice (I have a wheat allergy so carb loading is a bit hard)
Morning of: 2 gluten free waffles and coffee, then 2 salt tabs before run
During race: Huma gels every 40 mins or so, 2 salt tabs halfway through. About 30 oz of water during the run.

Does anyone have any advice? Thanks so much.

1nh3uxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/lookedoutside/comments/1nh3uxv/outoftheloop_whats_happened/,OutOfTheLoop: What's happened?,"Hey guys. So yeah as the title says... what the hell?

I've had a bit of a bad episode emotionally the past couple weeks so I've basically done nothing but stay inside and play video games. Cut off all social media, videos, etc. Just banging out some Empires and Edicts (best game btw). For those who are worrying, I've been drinking plenty of water, eating decently etc. This happens fairly often in periods so I know how to take care of myself when feeling down with these episodes.

Ok so that's my context. I finally come out of this slump, prepare myself for the idea of going out for a bit, maybe sit in the park for a bit, get a coffee somewhere, you know just something to get out and get some fresh air; baby steps and all that to overcome anxiety.

  
So I check the news to see what's messed up in the world outside my bubble and... yeah I'll just say I'm f\*\*\*ing confused as s\*\*t. I can see text posts from other people just fine but pictures look all distorted and werid, like that go-go-gadget pixel reducer fan gif got the whole internet. Is that just me?  
And do I... should I even ask about these posts of people saying they've been ""transforming"" or... what?

Is there some new meme I'm not aware of from the last couple of weeks?

  
Okay tbf I have a bad habit of only reading news headlines and only skimming through reddit threads so I may be missing something easily.

  
TL:DR, sorry for the long rambling. Could someone summarise what's happened in the last couple of weeks as if they were speaking to someone who just woke up from a coma, or came back from a nature retreat etc?

I’ve had anorexia, bulimia and OCD for what feels like an eternity, which caused irreparable damage to my bowels. My peristalsis is extremely slow. My routine is as follows: eating on the weekends, then consuming only liquids (tea, coffee, cranberry juice) during the weekdays. When I eat, I pump myself full of laxatives. Lactulose 3 times a day, 6-8 Dulcolax pills on the morning of my “cleaning out” day. I also consume senna tea, but fuck, it tastes awful and causes me so much pain. Usually, I kept my binges in check by eating “mindfully” (fruits, veggies, chicken, tuna, sweets here and there) during the weekends. And it worked until I contracted a Helicobater Pylori infection, which restarted my bulimia. At first, I vomited because I genuinely had to, but it soon became an excuse to purge. The interesting thing is that I don’t purge to get rid of calories, as strange as that sounds. I purge to get rid of the grams of food, so there’s less to poop out, because that is a process my body is becoming increasingly incapable of doing. Enemas don’t work on me. Suppositories take a lot of time to work (once it took them 24 hours to kick in). The last time I used it, nothing came out even after 2 hours, which scared me because I thought I had an obstruction and would die from sepsis or something like that. The whole ordeal made me start taking antidepressants again, which are helping a little, but my nutrition is still a mess. I made the decision to start eating every day, but I didn’t follow through cause my gallbladder started hurting (I have two gallstones) every time I ate, and I was afraid it would burst. So I stopped eating, again, and didn’t consume any food for 9 days straight. Which leads me to this weekend. Yesterday, I ate a normal amount of food. Kefir and 3 strawberries for breakfast, tuna salad with Greek yogurt for lunch, and some ice cream and other sweets with my family in the evening. This morning, I had the same breakfast, and I ate carrots and peas with some low fat chicken salami, Greek yogurt and some chia bread. But I barely pooped today, and that is a binge trigger for me, for some fucked up reason. So I binged. Hard. Two types of ice cream, lots of sweets, some cheese and salami, chips, and chocolate pudding. I was sure that I would have a successful purging session after the amount of food I consumed in such a short period of time, but I tried for over an hour to make myself vomit, and absolutely nothing came out. I couldn’t try anymore, so I gave up. I drank my lactulose dosage and now I’m drinking senna tea. And then I’m gonna take my sleeping meds and hope they kick in. I’ll take around 8 Dulcolax in the morning, and another cup of senna tea. I think it’s important to note that I’m underweight (won’t put any numbers, cause I’m on mobile so I can’t blur them out), so the amount of food I’ve consumed is concerning, especially since my body is not used to it. I don’t care all that much if I gain weight from this binge episode. I’m old enough now to know that gaining a few kilograms won’t be the end of the world. But since I did consume junk food and my body is barely capable of digesting fibrous foods, I’m really scared that I won’t be able to shit all of this out. I’m worried about my gallbladder as well, cause this is too much food for it, too. I guess I’m just looking for advice on how to deal with the aftermath of a binge episode with an unsuccessful purge. Currently, I feel a heaviness and some pain in my abdomen, but that is to be expected, I suppose. Especially after the senna tea. I haven’t pooped, of course. Are there any things I should watch out for? Is there any hope that this will turn out okay? I’ve been to the hospital far too many times this summer, and I’m frankly embarrassed of going there again tomorrow. If things go awry and my bowels or stomach or gallbladder burst, I think I’ll just die at home, in terrible agony. I’m so scared and angry at myself for binging when I should have just skipped dinner and went to bed. But I have another 5 days of starving ahead of me, so the all or nothing mindset kicked in, and I couldn’t fight it. Obviously, I’m too weak for that.

When we first got together, his mom and I had a good relationship, even met for coffee a few times alone and used to text. Looking back, she was almost too nice and it seems fake if that makes sense. I’m not 100% sure what happened, but as soon as I got pregnant something switched. She told my husband she felt like she was bothering me so she stopped making any effort. She used the excuse that it took me a few hours to text her back during pregnancy so she never texted me again. But I tried to include her and the in laws in my pregnancy with updates. I have a feeling  she got upset she didn’t get her way during my pregnancy. She demanded to be in the delivery room and wanted to attend doctors appointments, but when I said no she seemed upset by that. One of her own children has cut her off and I’ve seen her post stuff about how my MIL is a narcissist.  

After the baby arrived, she’s been awful to be around and seems to be trying to assert her dominance and downplay my role as a mom. She invites herself over to our home 1-2 times a week and while she’s here, makes nasty comments that seem to fly over my husbands head. She just has awful energy and I feel sick after these visits, but I don’t trust her without me around due to her not respecting boundaries. I don’t feel comfortable letting my husband bring the baby to her home or leaving the house while she’s here. I asked them not to kiss the baby and she completely ignored that boundary. She’s also made so many weird comments to me. Just to give an idea, she’s commented on my weight/looks during pregnancy, told me she’s surprised I’m doing such a good job as a mom because I’m not as mature as my husband(on my first Mother’s Day!), gives unsolicited advice, refused to give baby back while crying( I’ve started grabbing him back now). One month postpartum, she told me I need to start cooking and came over to give me a “cooking lesson”. During this, she started talking about my husbands ex fiancee and told me she wants to come live next door to us to be closer to the baby. She comes into our home and immediately tries to snatch the baby which often upsets him. It feels like she has no regard for me or even wants a relationship with me anymore, she’s just trying to have a do over baby. On top of this she’s just been overbearing. The first couple weeks postpartum she overstayed her visits and was of zero help. Even called herself “mama” once before I confronted my husband and thankfully it never happened again. 

Today she came over and i was really trying my hardest to be nice. She was holding the baby and asked, “is mom taking good care of you?” Her tone was so nasty. I was fuming. Then later on she was holding him again and he was watching me in the kitchen. She made a “joke” that he needs to be watching her instead of me. 

I am 100% aware I have a husband problem. I’ve had many discussions with him surrounding his mother and have even told him I see divorce in our future if i have to keep dealing with his moms behavior without him defending me. I truly feel she’s a narcissist and has also recruited my sister in laws to go against me as well because they’ve been rude and excluding me since I got pregnant. My husband has confronted his mom several times, but she cries crocodile tears and guilt trips him. We’re considering moving about an hour away, which would lessen her visits, but I just feel so angry at how I’ve been treated postpartum and her lack of respect of me as a mom. Especially because she has several children and knows how it feels. I’ve completely stopped reaching out to her and only see her when she comes over, but I am losing my mind. My husband is the golden retriever type who sees no wrong in anyone ever. Which I love, but hate in this situation. He has definitely distanced himself from her and his family somewhat, but I feel trapped knowing she will come at least once a week and stay for hours.

1nh3meq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christian/comments/1nh3meq/church_coffee_stand_discussions/,Church Coffee Stand Discussions,"I'm starting the process of trying to set up a nice coffee ministry at our church. I learned recently that the church has had two high-end, home Espresso Machines (De'Longhi) sitting in their basement for a few years now. I got pretty excited when I learned about them and asked if I could put together a proposal for what a small church cafe set-up could look like.

I have two years of experience as a barista, so I have a decent amount of relevant day-to-day cafe knowledge. However, it's hard to know the best way to go about managing this kind of service in a church environment. A couple of potential topics that I'd love some thoughts on:

* ***Volume:***  
   * I have the Breville Barista Express at home. The time it takes me to make one hot drink is pretty long. Having two machines at church will help, but I still think it would be very slow compared to the industrial machines I'm used to in past cafes.
   * We have two services. We would allow people to get coffee before first service and in between services, but not after.
   * My concern is that the people serving espresso drinks and the people ordering them will be waiting far past the time that the services start.
   * **My current idea for avoiding this potential issue:**

1nh3kru,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1nh3kru/church_coffee_stand_questions/,Church Coffee Stand Questions,"I'm starting the process of trying to set up a nice coffee ministry at our church. I learned recently that the church has had two high-end, home Espresso Machines (De'Longhi) sitting in their basement for a few years now. I got pretty excited when I learned about them and asked if I could put together a proposal for what a small church cafe set-up could look like.

I have two years of experience as a barista, so I have a decent amount of relevant day-to-day cafe knowledge. However, it's hard to know the best way to go about managing this kind of service in a church environment. A couple of potential topics that I'd love some thoughts on:

* ***Volume:***  
   * I have the Breville Barista Express at home. The time it takes me to make one hot drink is pretty long. Having two machines at church will help, but I still think it would be very slow compared to the industrial machines I'm used to in past cafes.
   * We have two services. We would allow people to get coffee before first service and in between services, but not after.
   * My concern is that the people serving espresso drinks and the people ordering them will be waiting far past the time that the services start.
   * **My current idea for avoiding this potential issue:**
      * Continue to serve self-serve drip coffee (and increase the quality of that drip coffee to encourage people to take advantage of that service more)
      * Have an official start time for espresso drinks
      * Put a certain number of ""tickets"" out for people to grab. A person will grab a ticket for themselves and then the FOH barista will take that ticket from them, write down their name, write down their espresso drink order, and hand it to the barista on bar

1nh3kl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1nh3kl6/considering_divorce_despite_technically_nothing/,Considering divorce despite (technically) nothing being wrong,";tldr: I am thinking of leaving my wife of many years despite nothing being wrong between us. This will destroy her and I don't know what it will do to our child. I need an outside perspective but can't talk to anyone because it would humiliate my wife and put our friend in an awkward position. Is this cognitive dissonance? Mid-life crisis? Or truly something broken in me?

A bit of context: I have been married to my wife for 15+ years, 20+ together. We were young when we first met (<20 years old). We've had a mostly happy relationship with a few distinct exceptions: I left her once, before we were married, for a few months. We also went through a rough patch a few years ago but fixed things during covid. It's been good since then. We have a child together who's about about to hit the teenage years. 

We made a life for ourselves outside of our home country and made new friends. We travel as much as we can afford, and love our time together on vacations. We have harmony at home. We both work, and we both go through difficult times (tired, stress) which do sometimes take a toll. Our sex life is mediocre - when we do find ourselves in the mood at the same time and do it, it's great. However we're mostly out of sync so we only have sex every few months.

When my wife's responsibilities at work grew (a few years back), I stepped up (since I work from home often) and handled more of the cleaning and some of the cooking, making sure she didn't have to do as much when she returned home. We split our chores well and they are not a cause for marital stress. We are also very aligned on our child's upbringing.

All in all what I'm trying to say is that there isn't really an overt reason for my decision nor something that I might complain about (yes, maybe the sex, but I perceive it as more of an out-of-sync issue than something that bothers me frequently. My sex drive is also often missing so I can't place blame). 

So why am I thinking it? It started with an overwhelming desire to be, simply, alone. I don't feel like I know myself as myself anymore. I've been defined by my relationship for so long. I find that the marriage is all-consuming. How can I put this? I believe that the way my marriage is right now \_is as marriage should be\_. I dedicate myself to my family to an almost complete amount. I have friends and sometimes we go out and I have my hobbies of course and freedom to pursue them, but mostly we do family things: we eat together and we go out together and we vacation together etc. It's as it should be, but I start feeling like it's not what I want.

I guess there has always been a gap between us in terms of how we see ""love"" - for her, this relationship is everything and it's all she ever wanted (even during hard times). I have struggled with monogamy (I cheated but mildly - never slept with anyone else - and only in our 1st year of relationship and never since married). Generally I am the one in the relationship with a need or desire to sometimes be alone. Fairly typical situation, I would assume. An imbalance of ""need""'. This imbalance weighs on me. I am both unhappy that I can't reciprocate her feelings in equal measure but it is also a burden to mean so much to someone. I should specify that during our rough patch I also came close to asking for a divorce. At the time though, it would have been financially ruinous. Now things have changed and there is more stability (even if something were to happen to our jobs). 

I had to do a lot of introspection lately so I could get myself out of the slippery path towards an addiction that was threatening to manifest. I avoided it feel more clear-minded and more balanced than possibly ever before in my life.

I just don't want to be responsible for my wife's happiness anymore. I don't want to pay for stuff. I don't want to plan vacations together. I want a much more modest life and to feel happy with little. I want to go for walks and coffee alone or just spend the weekend working on a side-project and not have to account to anyone what I'm doing and why. 

I love our child and have no intention of being out of their life. I intend to remain close, to split custody as well as all the money 50/50, to make the separation work. I have nobody on the side and don't intent to pursue anyone for as far as I can anticipate at the moment. 50/50 custody means that I would have some freedom half the time (I know it's never that easy), but even when not, my child was never a burden to me in the same way as the marriage so it sounds like a great deal. 

Could this be mid life crisis? Could it be me convincing myself that I'm in a bad spot so I can perform this most heinous and monstrous act and break or family? Could it be a genuine issue? I can't figure it out. Hoping for some advice and/or similar people with similar circumstances.",2,1757885564.0,Divorce,4,0.75,False

I've been obsessed with finding the perfect cup of hot chocolate lately, and after trying dozens of different hot chocolate makers, I wanted to share my experiences and recommendations.

Let me tell you, not all hot chocolate makers are created equal. After countless cups (and probably too much sugar), I've discovered some real gems that make incredibly rich and creamy hot chocolate.

First up, I absolutely love the Cuisinart Hot Chocolate Maker. It's been my go-to for the past year, and I found it through this great deal here: https://athometouch.com/hot-chocolate-maker. What sets it apart is its powerful heating element and perfect temperature control. It never scorches the milk, which is crucial for that perfect cup.

I've found that the best hot chocolate makers share some key features:
- Temperature control settings
- Easy-to-clean components
- Automatic stirring function
- Capacity for multiple servings

The Breville Hot Chocolate Maker is another fantastic option. While it's pricier, the quality is outstanding. It has this amazing frothing mechanism that creates the most luxurious texture.

For budget-conscious chocolate lovers, Mr. Coffee's hot chocolate maker is surprisingly good. It's simple but gets the job done well.

Speaking of great deals, I recently spotted some amazing prices on premium hot chocolate makers here: https://athometouch.com/hot-chocolate-maker. The selection is impressive, and the prices are hard to beat.

Here's a pro tip: Look for machines with removable pitchers. Trust me, it makes cleaning so much easier, especially when dealing with thick chocolate residue.

Some features that really matter:
- Milk frother capability
- Non-stick coating
- Auto shut-off function
- Dishwasher-safe parts

I've noticed that European brands tend to include better frothing mechanisms, while American brands often focus on larger serving sizes. Both have their merits, depending on your needs.

One thing I learned the hard way - avoid machines without temperature control. You'll end up with either lukewarm chocolate or burnt milk, and nobody wants that!

For families, I recommend models with at least 4-cup capacity. Singles might prefer compact versions that make 1-2 cups at a time.

Bottom line: invest in quality. A good hot chocolate maker will last years and provide countless cozy moments. Whether you're a casual sipper or a hot chocolate connoisseur, there's a perfect machine out there for you.

Remember to always read customer reviews and check warranty terms before making your final choice. Happy hot chocolate making!",1,1757885261.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

Arrived at 1:20 on Sunday. They close at 2pm, I knew we were a little later in the day, and was expecting later in the day bagels, but they were still pushing out orders to-go and at to eat there. 
The menu is a little confusing. 
They have a BYO lox bagel for $11, but you pay 50 cents addt’l for veggies, and I added tomatoes, red onion, capers. 

But I realized they have a Diamond bagel for $9 that lets you pick your protein and comes with up to three veggies. 
So maybe I over paid for what I got? I asked for clarification on the menu differences. If anyone knows why those two variations exist let me know. 

Ok taste profile. 
This was my favorite bagel so far. The chew was great. Good flavor, not super dense, and the ingredients inside all meshed well together with good proportions. Mine was a little pushed because it was cut through all the way and I smashed it trying to separate, but my wife got the same thing and it was stacked beautifully. 
At this point I’m really comparing the texture of the bagel, the quality of the internal components, and how it all works together, and this one was really good. 
Staff was friendly, decent parking, though I bet during peak times it’s a little hectic, but according to the sign, they do prioritize online orders, so place that order ahead for pickup and just grab and go unless you want to eat there and enjoy the view of Chicon.

Currently drunk and tired. I posted this story on an image board with robots (iytyk) I am in my early 20s and an med student from the Caucasus. I meet a girl in uni and I got the butterflies in my stomach when i first talked to her. She was kind, funny, smart, pretty and so unique. I got close to her and started to talk and get along with her. I kept shooting my shot but kept getting friend-zoned(i should have not stayed but i was stupid). I finally gets some dignity and tell her how I truly felt and said that I liked her alot. She told me that it was okay but that she saw me as a great friend and couldn’t lose me. So a month ago she gets a bf. I was angry and sad to the point of insanity anons. But I kept it inside me because it wasnt her fault at all. She didnt owe me a relationship. We were just friend Now before we continue I need to give some context. I grew up in an extremely abusive household. Where my dad terrorized us all physically and emotionally. No one was safe, not my mom not me not his own mom or grandpa who terrorized my dad when he was young himself. I grew up a runt. I was bullied and terrorized (I am barely getting myself to type these out, i think saying any of these out loud would genuinely kill me) I am a coward, i am a coward who is afraid of confrontation , someone yelling at me. I cant help it I get an primal reaction to fear I am like a humiliated and beaten dog with no confidence. I used the gym to cope, to feel in control to feel less scared. When i worked out i felt like i could not be intimidated or bullied. I was preparing for revenge against those who abused me. This motivation made 12 year old me train 6 days a week 2-3 hours till this day.  When the tires i punched bounced back and caved in, when the chains rattled on the punching bad i felt like i wasnt a weak crap who could not defend himself let alone his own mother. So fast forward a week ago I am on park around 9 pm when my female friend and her bf come up me and her have an series of inside jokes that makes us obnoxious to be around frankly. She always compliments me because even tho she doesnt know how insecure and fragile i truly am she can feel it. After a while her bf tells her to go bring us coffee. She goes to a cafe to get them He tries to intimidate me because he feels insecure i guess. And here there is a culture of distrusting the male friend and out alpha ing him  and telling him to say away. One thing leads to another and he pushes me. I felt scared, i felt scared of his yelling. Not of him obviously…. But the sound reminded me of my dad stomping/ slamming things and yelling. My heart was pounding out of my chest and it felt like gravity didnt exist for a second and I floated then it came back in an instant 10 times stronger. I have sparred and fought in the ring for years but i never felt this. I remember what I did to him and i regret it as much as I regret being a cringy kid. I feel like such a loser for using my strength against him and not my dad. Here i am scared of people who could die from my actions if i am not careful. I did an open hand eye poke jab then a cross, i landed 1 hook to his ribs and one to his jaw, I was out then i kicked him forward and got ontop of him and started to hit with all my might. My hand tore up and my knuckles got cut by his teeth. Then the most regrettable part came She came to get me off of him and this enraged me even more…. In that moment I blamed everything on her. Why didnt she love me why did she date him and get me to do this. I am genuinely shedding tears as I type this. I dont care that I cant be a doctor now i dont care that I have court. I am done

About 12 years ago when I was 20 he asked me on a date and I said yes, but I really wasn’t sure of what I wanted (in a person or physically) or if I even liked him like that at the time. I didn’t want to string him along so communicated I only saw him as a friend and didn’t want to date again. Life happened, I moved away, moved abroad, moved back, had a couple relationships that didn’t work out. 

Fast forward to 18 months ago, I’m back living locally and we’ve reconnected as friends. We get together every couple of weeks for a walk and coffee/beer. Obviously we’re both different people from 12 yrs ago so it’s like we’ve been getting to know each other again. 

About a year ago we were out one night and I was really drunk and I basically asked if he’d ever thought about us as more and he said yes, and I said ‘yeh I have too but I don’t know my heads just a mess’ - he said our friendship was the most important thing and didn’t wana loose it. 

My heads scrambled. Recently, in the last few months I find myself wondering what he’s up to, hoping he’ll drive past and give me a little wave, looking out for him when I’m in town ect. He has a load of qualities I really admire and I feel very safe when I’m around him. 

I’m worried/overthinking so many things and I have had in the past an issue with non-committal and (I’m not proud) stringing people along because I couldn’t make my mind up..  the sort of things that keep me up are  - 
The stages of life were both at 
Differences in the boring stuff like careers
What friend and family would think
If I’m just thinking it’s something when it’s not and I’m just lonely 
What if I’m not lonely and i have real feelings and I should just go for it, but then he says no and then being friends is weird 

I so deeply don’t want to hurt this man and I’m wrestling with it. I feel like I could just be finding excuses because I’m scared of rejection, or do I need to take some time to ask myself some more questions (and what are these)??? 

Help me please. 

TLDR: do I shoot my shot or let it go?

It was really nice to connect with a cross section of our community (many towns and demographics represented). 

Our second book will be “Klara and the Sun” by Kazuo Ishiguro, and we plan to meet on Thursday, October 9 at 6pm. Venue is still TBD but I’m thinking a coffee shop or book store next time. If you have an interest please reply to this message or DM me and I’ll add you to our distribution list. We definitely want to sustain the momentum and everyone is welcome.

M33, moved to Stockholm bit over 3 years ago. I go to gym, play guitar and wanna go back to running but I still haven't moved my lazy ass from sofa. My swedish is so-so but I am actively trying to improve it.

I belive that ""best"" second way (first being meeting someone in real life) to find friend is to get to know someone first.

If I just open thread and ask who wants have a beer - lot's of people will say yes but almost no one will show up, at least from my experience :) 

So I wanna try something else. I am casually playing DoTA2, mostly turbo modes in evenings when I have time. No pressure or anything if we lose, it is turbo anyway :) I lose on my own anyway, hardly you can make it worse :)

If you wanna just join and have a game or two whenever you have time, send me a DM. No need for voice chat or anything (but possible if you wanna).

If after few games we wanna grab coffee/beer after work - even better. If not, we can just keep playing when we meet online!

You play something else? I can give it a try, my PC should be able to handle it (hopefully). 

Don't play dota2 but just wanna just chat in DM? That is cool also. No pressure for anything. If we feel like grabbing a coffee/beer after some time - even better!

1nh37j9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeStressTest/comments/1nh37j9/explore_if_the_yuhfera_sofa_armrest_tray_table_is/,Explore If the YUHFERA Sofa Armrest Tray Table Is Worth the Hype,"The YUHFERA YU8007 is an interesting addition to my living room. From the moment I set it up, I realized it’s not just a simple side table; it brings a mixed bag of convenience, functionality, and a touch of style. This furniture piece found its place in my small corner, seamlessly fitting next to my couch like it was meant to be there. Using it daily, I’ve come to appreciate what works well and what could be better. Let me share my experience after putting this table to the test.

**Versatile Design for Compact Spaces**  
This table is compact enough to fit in tight areas without feeling cramped but spacious enough for practical use. With its C-shaped design, it slides neatly under my couch, saving precious floor space. Anyone who’s dealing with small apartments or limited room space would find this feature incredibly useful. Whether it's holding drinks, snacks, or even my tablet, it’s a space-efficient and handy little table.

[Check YUHFERA YU8007 price on Amazon.](https://verycosy.com/p/b0csfj16zv/)

**Adjustability and Swivel Function**  
What truly sets this table apart is its height-adjustable legs. They're extendable from 18 inches to 33 inches, making it a good option for adults and kids alike. I’ve personally used it for everything from enjoying breakfast in bed to holding my laptop while working on the couch. The 360° swivel panel adds even more convenience by letting me rotate the table surface with ease. Adjusting the height and swiveling the top is intuitive and smooth, adding to its overall usability. However, I noticed the adjustment mechanism feels slightly stiff at times, which could be improved for a more seamless experience.

**Durability and Build Quality**  
Crafted from wood and metal, it feels robust yet lightweight enough to move around without hassle. The tabletop has a rustic vintage finish that’s both stylish and functional, though it does show minor scratches from heavy daily use. Its metal legs are sturdy, but since the maximum weight recommendation is ten pounds, I’ve avoided placing anything particularly heavy on it. For regular items like cups, books, or electronics, it's held up just fine.

**Good Aspects**  
- Compact size perfect for tight spaces.  
- Adjustable height and 360° swivel feature add a layer of versatility.  
- Attractive vintage aesthetic that blends effortlessly with most décor.  
- Suitable for multiple uses: coffee table, TV tray, or snack holder.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Height adjustment mechanism could be smoother.  
- The tabletop can scratch easily if not handled carefully.  
- Limited weight capacity might be a concern for some users.  

**Other Options**  
In comparing this table with other similar products, I found it stacks well against competitors. For instance, there are other C-shaped tables available that often lack the 360° swivel feature, or their adjustability options are more restrictive. On the flip side, pricier alternatives sometimes incorporate foldable options or stain-resistant tabletops, which this one does not offer. If you’re keen on a sturdier or more customizable product, there are models from other brands that might suit those needs better—but you’ll likely lose the sleek rustic design and simplicity this one provides.

**Money's Worth**  
Despite its minor flaws, this sofa armrest tray speaks volumes about affordable quality. It manages to balance price and functionality better than I anticipated. For someone like me, who primarily uses it for casual purposes like browsing on a tablet or hosting snacks and drinks, it’s a great find. If you’re searching for a durable tray table that doesn’t break the bank while offering decent features, this option fits the bill.

When we first got together, his mom and I had a good relationship, even met for coffee a few times alone and used to text. Looking back, she was almost too nice and it seems fake if that makes sense. I’m not 100% sure what happened, but as soon as I got pregnant something switched. She told my husband she felt like she was bothering me so she stopped making any effort. She used the excuse that it took me a few hours to text her back during pregnancy so she never texted me again. But I tried to include her and the in laws in my pregnancy with updates. I have a feeling  she got upset she didn’t get her way during my pregnancy. She demanded to be in the delivery room and wanted to attend doctors appointments, but when I said no she seemed upset by that. One of her own children has cut her off and I’ve seen her post stuff about how my MIL is a narcissist.  

After the baby arrived, she’s been awful to be around and seems to be trying to assert her dominance and downplay my role as a mom. She invites herself over to our home 1-2 times a week and while she’s here, makes nasty comments that seem to fly over my husbands head. She just has awful energy and I feel sick after these visits, but I don’t trust her without me around due to her not respecting boundaries. I don’t feel comfortable letting my husband bring the baby to her home or leaving the house while she’s here. I asked them not to kiss the baby and she completely ignored that boundary. She’s also made so many weird comments to me. Just to give an idea, she’s commented on my weight/looks during pregnancy, told me she’s surprised I’m doing such a good job as a mom because I’m not as mature as my husband(on my first Mother’s Day!), gives unsolicited advice, refused to give baby back while crying( I’ve started grabbing him back now). One month postpartum, she told me I need to start cooking and came over to give me a “cooking lesson”. During this, she started talking about my husbands ex fiancee and told me she wants to come live next door to us to be closer to the baby. She comes into our home and immediately tries to snatch the baby which often upsets him. It feels like she has no regard for me or even wants a relationship with me anymore, she’s just trying to have a do over baby. On top of this she’s just been overbearing. The first couple weeks postpartum she overstayed her visits and was of zero help. Even called herself “mama” once before I confronted my husband and thankfully it never happened again. 

Today she came over and i was really trying my hardest to be nice. She was holding the baby and asked, “is mom taking good care of you?” Her tone was so nasty. I was fuming. Then later on she was holding him again and he was watching me in the kitchen. She made a “joke” that he needs to be watching her instead of me. 

I am 100% aware I have a husband problem. I’ve had many discussions with him surrounding his mother and have even told him I see divorce in our future if i have to keep dealing with his moms behavior without him defending me. I truly feel she’s a narcissist and has also recruited my sister in laws to go against me as well because they’ve been rude and excluding me since I got pregnant. My husband has confronted his mom several times, but she cries crocodile tears and guilt trips him. We’re considering moving about an hour away, which would lessen her visits, but I just feel so angry at how I’ve been treated postpartum and her lack of respect of me as a mom. Especially because she has several children and knows how it feels. I’ve completely stopped reaching out to her and only see her when she comes over, but I am losing my mind. My husband is the golden retriever type who sees no wrong in anyone ever. Which I love, but hate in this situation. He has definitely distanced himself from her and his family somewhat, but I feel trapped knowing she will come at least once a week and stay for hours.

**Quotes from much longer paywalled article by journalist Julia Tellman:**

""Since being introduced in 1980, the number of \[neighborhood\] plans has ballooned to 25, with 434 distinct subareas governed by different land use policies and zoning regulations.

To some residents, these documents represent grassroots community planning and neighborhood activism at its best. But others say the plans represent the power of being the loudest voice in the room, the privilege of having time to organize, and the expertise to toe off against local government. And city officials believe they represent an outdated and complicated form of infrastructure planning, now better represented by regularly updated citywide plans. That’s what city planners told the Bellingham City Council earlier this year as they explained the intention to retire the 25 neighborhood plans as part of the once-a-decade comprehensive plan update. 

**Complexity and cost**

Because of sweeping state legislation that enables more types of housing in what was previously deemed “single-family residential,” many of the concepts in the neighborhood plans are obsolete. …

The extra layer of zones and regulations in each neighborhood subarea present administrative challenges and are difficult for the community and developers to understand. Essentially, it takes an expert to parse the zoning code, long-range planning manager Chris Behee told council in May.

Ali Taysi is one of those experts. … “There are literally hundreds of little unique polygons, each with its own micro-regulations,” Taysi said. “It adds a degree of complexity that’s very hard for the layperson to understand.” 

It also contributes to the housing affordability crisis. 

“Time is money,” Taysi said. “The government can’t control the cost of labor or materials or lending, but the one thing they can control is time, and unpredictability in process generates cost through time.” … Last year it took, on average, 167 calendar days to process complex permits …

**City planners: Improve equity across neighborhoods**

City planners say one reason for retiring the plans is to improve equity across neighborhoods. … Some of the plans are dozens of pages long, with granular details about community character and guidance for future city actions. Others are shorter and less detailed, and some haven’t been updated since adoption. The variability stems largely from which neighborhoods have historically had residents, mainly property owners, who felt empowered to advocate for themselves. …

And in 2026, city planners hope to work on code updates that will allow small-scale commercial uses — like corner stores and coffee shops — in residential zones, a request they heard repeatedly from the public during the comprehensive planning process.”",16,1757884410.0,Bellingham,9,0.91,False

We have been having noticeably bad toilet clogging issues at the office. My employees have mentioned several times how it has become an issue since it has left the toilets out of order for an extended period of time and it caused a great inconvenience for them.

One of them accidentally walked into a badly clogged toilet and said the smell made them feel “ill”. They said they were going to hunt down the culprit as it is unacceptable. To prevent any further work drama, I decided I would come clean that I was the one that had been clogging the toilets. They were visibly upset and started to interrogate me on how it has been happening so frequently. I decided to be open and explain my bathroom routine to them. I said that I first place a paper seat cover on the toilet. Then I would grab a paper towel from the sink and place it in nicely in the bowl to prevent any “splash-age”.  As soon as I mentioned this step, my staff was furious and started yelling at me. “How could you do this?!?!” “A PAPER TOWEL???” “You are 50 and you still don’t know how to shit??”. They wouldn’t let me get in a word to respond. I sat patiently until their raging fumes were exhausted.

When I finally had a chance to speak, I did my best to make my case. I told them that this has been my methodology for a long time after I got tired of the toilet water splashing up on me. The majority of the time the toilet doesn’t clog as I paid a plumber to add extra flushing power. I even explained how I put a traffic cone outside of the bathroom whenever it got clogged so no one would go in. I guess I should’ve put a sign up too in hindsight. I always unclog the toilet myself after work and I have time to do so. Usually only one bathroom is clogged at a time and we have other bathrooms nearby. I never thought it would be such a big deal. Now my employees are asking for 5% raise due to the inconveniences I have caused. I think they are being unreasonable for a small inconvenience. I have conceded and promised not to use paper towels in the toilet anymore. I think they are overblowing this and they even started calling me mean names like “paper towel poopy boy”. They think it’s fair game to name call because I have nicknames for them like “Bald”, “Coffee girl”, “Visa boy”, “0-2 boxer”, and “lawn pooper”.

You try something new or push a skill, and sooner or later you **mess up.** Maybe you trip on the same step twice, flub a line in your rap verse, or spill coffee on that essay draft. In those moments it’s easy to think, *“Yo, I’m really not cut out for this.”* But before you start calling yourself a failure, pause and breathe. What if a mistake isn’t **who you are**, but just **something that happened**? What if you could reset your mindset in an instant? In Zen circles they have a saying, and we’ll put it in our own words: **“Errors are just conditions, not me or mine. Begin again, with kindness.”** This is the vibe we’re exploring, learning to fail better and come back kinder, like a real one. 

Let me tell y’all a quick story from the block. There’s this kid at the local skate park, let’s call him **Jay**. He’s been grinding (literally) on landing a kickflip off a ledge. Day in, day out, Jay shows up with scuffed sneakers and big energy. And every day, *boom* – he crashes out. One afternoon, after his tenth fall, Jay’s had it. He slams his board down, frustrated.

On the park bench nearby sits **Uncle Rome**, an old head skater known for smooth ollies and smoother wisdom. He’s been watching Jay’s fails without a word. Seeing the outburst, Uncle Rome chuckles and calls out, *“Yo, you good? That concrete hittin’ you hard or what?”*

Jay wipes the sweat and mutters, *“Man, I’m trash at this. Why can’t I land it? Maybe I should just quit.”* He’s lowkey ashamed, feeling every bruise in his pride. Uncle Rome stands up, strolls over slow. He picks up Jay’s board, hands it back to him gentle, almost ceremonial. Then he says, *“Lil man, that fall* ***was*** *rough. But look,* ***that fall ain’t you****.”* Jay looks confused. Uncle Rome continues, *“Falling is a* ***condition*** *of learning to skate, feel me? Just a situation. It* ***ain’t you, it ain’t yours****. So don’t carry it like a name.”*

Jay still seems unsure, kicking dust. Uncle Rome pats his shoulder: *“Every skater falls. The real ones get back up* ***kind****. Mad or sad, but kind, especially to themselves. So what we do?”* He taps the board. *“We begin again, with kindness. Now, breathe and* ***hit that trick one mo’ time****.”*

It wasn’t some fancy Dharma hall, just a cracked concrete lot with graffiti on the walls and a Tupac track bumping in the distance. But to Jay, in that moment, those words landed cleaner than any kickflip. He nods, steps back on the board, heart a little lighter. He still falls a few more times that week, but something’s changed: each tumble isn’t the end of the story, just another chapter.

**“Errors are just conditions, not me or mine. Begin again, with kindness.”** Let’s unpack that real quick. In Jay’s story, the **error** (the fall) was a condition of trying to land the trick. It wasn’t a personal defect or some unchangeable label on him. How often do we **all** do this? We fail a test or choke during a performance and suddenly we’re thinking *“I’m a failure, I’m weak, I’m not built for this.”* But an error is an event, not a definition. It’s like catching a flat tire on the road, you wouldn’t say **you** are the flat tire, right? It’s just a condition: something that happened, that’s gonna change once you fix it and move on.

Uncle Rome dropping knowledge at the skate park is that same wisdom in street language. His vibe was real **Zen** and real **hood** at the same time, and that’s exactly what makes it hit home for folks like Jay (and us). We’re out here juggling school, work, side hustles, social pressures – *the hustle is* ***real***. And with hustle comes slip-ups. The **daily grind** will test you whether you’re debugging code, practicing kickflips, typing out a term paper, or spitting bars in a freestyle cipher.

The commentary in the koan tradition usually digs into the deeper meaning behind the story. Here, the deeper meaning is about **identity and resilience**. It’s saying: *Don’t fuse who you are with what just went wrong.* Jay thought failing the trick meant **he** was a failure. But Uncle Rome brought him back to reality: failing the trick just meant he’s *learning*. In Zen practice, when your mind wanders during meditation, teachers say gently, *“begin again.”* No drama, no self-hate , just come back to the breath. Life is kinda similar. When you fumble, whether you miss a note in a piano piece or drop your phone for the third time today, instead of popping off at yourself, you recognize it as a passing moment. **It happened, it’s over, and it ain’t “mine” to cling to.**

For my Black fam this hits on another level. A lot of us grew up with the mantra that we gotta be **twice as good** to get half as far, or the pressure to never show weakness. So when we slip, it cuts deep. But real talk: **perfection is a myth** and failure is part of everybody’s story. Our ancestors survived and thrived by learning from a million failures, remixing recipes, innovating music and slang, adapting on the fly. *Messing up and trying again is in our DNA.* So giving ourselves grace is not only kind, it’s **revolutionary**.

Notice how Uncle Rome said “begin again, with kindness” specifically *with kindness*. That kindness is key. It’s not just “get up and keep grinding;” it’s **how** you get up. Instead of, *“Dammit, get up, you fuck nigga,”* it’s *“Alright, I got this, let’s try once more.”* It’s hype yourself, not hate yourself. When you treat yourself with a little compassion, you bounce back faster and cooler. You can laugh it off, learn the lesson, and keep it pushing.

In the **daily grind** of life, this might look like you’ve typed a whole code and the program crashes. Take a breath, maybe chuckle, and say “time to debug, I’m built for this,” rather than “I’m so dumb.” Or you stumble over lyrics while recording. Instead of storming out the booth, you smile, punch in again, and flow on. Each “error” is an event in time, not a scar on your soul. *Every moment gives you a new shot.*

Zen folks sometimes describe life as a series of moments; each moment dies and the next is born anew. That’s why **any moment** you can restart your mindset. You don’t need to wait for tomorrow or next week to be kinder to yourself, you can do it literally right after the slip. This isn’t being soft or letting yourself off too easy, it’s actually holding yourself to a *truer* standard: the standard of resilience. As an old proverb goes, *“Fall down seven times, stand up eight.”* We level up not by never falling, but by how we rise each time, carrying a bit more wisdom and a lot more heart. So how do we put this into practice? Think of this section like the *“what do I do with this koan?”* part. Here’s a few pointers, keeping it **grounded** and real:

* **Next time you fail, notice the self-talk.** Catch yourself in the act if you start saying “I’m garbage” or “I’ll never get it.” Remind yourself: *That’s just the frustration talking.* The error is a blip, not your identity. Literally tell yourself: *“This mistake is a condition of the moment. Let’s leave it in the moment.”*
* **Take a breath and reset.** Whether it’s a deep breath at your desk or a quick lap around the block, do something to mark a mental reset. Athletes tap their chest and point upward after a miss, gamers hit the reset button. Find your reset move. It signals: *New moment, who dis?* Start fresh.
* **Begin again, gently.** Return to the task with a calmer mind. If you were typing and messed up, delete the blooper and start the line over slowly. If you fell off the board, pick it up, shake off your legs, and roll again with a relaxed stance. If you forgot your lines on stage, smile it off and pick up from the last bar or improvise a new one. Treat it casually, like it ain’t no big deal (because really, it isn’t in the grand scheme).
* **Keep a kind tone.** Literally, talk to yourself like you would to your best friend. Would you tell your homie “Wow, you suck, just quit” if they messed up? Hell no (and if you would, check yourself!). You’d probably say “It’s all good fam, you got the next one.” Give *yourself* that same energy. Hype yourself up. Be your own coach.

This “instruction” isn’t a strict rule, but an invitation. Try it out next time life throws shade at your plans. See how it feels to respond with chill confidence instead of despair or anger. It might feel awkward at first (especially if you’re used to roasting yourself), but over time it starts hitting different. It becomes a habit of resilience.

This thread was inspired by the classic Zen koans but remixed for our hustle and flow. The phrase “Errors are just conditions, not me or mine. Begin again, with kindness.” is the core of the case – a mantra you can carry in your back pocket whenever you’re out here learning something, be it coding, skating, rapping, or simply living. We kept it humble and inviting because truth be told, we’re all in this practice together.

Feel free to drop your own “case” in the comments. 💬 Did you have a moment in training, work, or everyday life where you messed up and then broke through? What was your kickflip moment or your personal koan of starting over? Share your story – a time you fell on your face (maybe literally, maybe figuratively), what you learned, and how you began again. By sharing these gems, we all learn.

Remember: Ain’t nobody out here perfect. We fall and we get up. Over and over. That’s life, and that’s growth. So let’s keep that energy: begin again, with kindness, and help each other along the way.

1nh2xfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dustythunder/comments/1nh2xfc/mini_update_i_didnt_return_company_equipment_when/,"Mini Update: I didn't return ""Company Equipment"" when I left my old job","Hey all! I got a mini update for you. I used google to find a location comparison for privacy purposes, and it popped out Des Moines and Amos Iowa. Both are flyover states, similar size and distance from each other (about an hour) and Amos is also a college town. Again, not where I'm from, but it's a decent placeholder for this.

So, I live and work in my Amos equivalent. There is a main office in my version of Des Moines where two other techs typically work as they live south of Des Moines and it'd be a 2 to 3-hour commute for then to get to Amos when I can do it in about 15 minutes through city traffic. With Windows 10 nearing End of Life, I've been contracted more days a week lately to get some back-end work done ahead of the mandatory push to Windows 11. This includes 1 day a week in Des Moines, too. I hadn't seen the opinionated lady at all for the 3 days I was in Amos, and I did watch for her to be safe. Turns out, she works in the Des Moines location! My guess is she was only in Amos as it was new hire day and they like the full local team to be present so new hires can put faces with names. 

She saw me first while I was hunched over a laptop. I only heard, ""You work here too??"" Later, I'd learn she was there for my coworkers cause she was having an issue with one of her systems. I looked up expecting to see someone from the Amos location and didn't immediately connect who she was. I think that pissed her off -- the fact that she isn't living rent free in my head or whatever. It's ADHD and other medical ""fascinations"" that screw with my memory, but I didn't correct her. I only knew it was her when she said, ""Well, I did call \[company\] to let them know you had their equipment."" DING DING DING. ""Oh, did you call \[the 1-800 number\]? Cause no one there cares."" I don't know why I did that, but I'm gonna chalk it up to a combo of finally feeling more secure in this role, my ADHD's lack of filtering, and at least a portion of it to the encouraging words I got on my original post.

She rolled her eyes and scoffed, a classic move when you have no arguments left, and walked back to her desk. On the way to the break room for a free snack (soda and chips and fruit and coffee and... I was in heaven), I did a lap and watched for her. I seen her through the glass walls of a meeting room and was able to spot one person I knew. Names are hard, but I knew them based on where they sat in the Amos location cause I have to pass them on the way to my desk every day. Coworkers gave me her first name, last initial (how we do tickets in our system) and I have boss's face locked in for the next time I'm in the office. Is she the boss? No idea. It’s a place to start, at least. I will be back in Amos tomorrow (Monday) and hopefully “boss” will be too. Flexible hybrid schedule and most people hot desk, so I'm not sure. But Wednesday is the monthly ""we buy lunch for the office"" event that the company does, so she'll likely be in then. 

I'm sorry it's not much, but I wanted to keep you updated so you knew I wasn't just ignoring y'all. I did check, and HR isn't even in this state. Plus, the people who hired me don't have any ability to affect change in the office cause of the ""Chinese Wall"" in place. Basically, got confirmation that I'm a self-employed contractor, and my options were to figure it out on my end or stop accepting my weekly contracts and move along, which isn't going to happen. 

We’ll see what happens this week and I will be sure to let you know if anything else does. ",4,1757884020.0,dustythunder,1,1.0,False

I decided to build a humanizer because everyone was talking about beating AI detectors and there was a period time time where there were some good discussions around how ChatGPT (and others) were injecting (i don't think intentionally) hidden unicode chracters like a particular style of elipses (...) and em dash (-) along with hidden spaces not visible. Unicode Characters like a soft hypen (U+00AD) which are invisible.

I got curious and though that that these AI detectors were of course trained on AI text and would therefore at least score if they found multiple un-human amounts of hidden unicode.

I did a lot of research before begining building the tool and found the following (as a breif summary) are likley what these AI detectors like GPTZero, Originality etc will be scoring:

* **Perplexity** – Low = predictable phrasing. AI tends to write “safe,” obvious sentences. *Example: “The sky is blue” vs. “The sky glows like cobalt glass at dawn.”*
* **Burstiness** – Humans vary sentence lengths. AI keeps it uniform. *10 medium-length sentences in a row equals a bit of a red flag.*
* **N-gram Repetition** – AI can sometimes reuses 3–5 word chunks, more so throughout longer text. *“It is important to note that...”* × 6 = automatic suspicion.
* **Stylometric Patterns** – AI overuses perfect grammar, formal transitions, and avoids contractions. 
* **Formatting Artifacts** – Smart quotes, non-breaking spaces, zero-width characters. These can act like metadata fingerprints, especially if the text was copy and pasted from a chatbot window.
* **Token Patterns & Watermarks** – Some models bias certain tokens invisibly to “sign” the content.

Whilst i appreciate Mac's and word and other standard software uses some of these, some are not even on the standard keyboad, so be careful.

So the tool has two functions, it can simply just remove the hidden unicode chracters, or it can re-write the text (using AI, but fed with all the research and infomration I found packed into a system prompt) it then produces the output and automatically passes it back through the regex so it always comes out clean.

You don't need to use a tool for some of that though, here are some aactionable steps you can take to humanize your AI outputs, always consider:

1. **Vary sentence rhythm** – Mix short, medium, and long sentences.
2. **Replace AI clichés** – “In conclusion” → “So, what’s the takeaway?”
3. **Use idioms/slang (sparingly)** – “A tough nut to crack,” “ten a penny,” etc.
4. **Insert 1 personal detail** – A memory, opinion, or sensory detail an AI wouldn’t invent.
5. **Allow light informality** – Use contractions, occasional sentence fragments, or rhetorical questions.
6. **Be dialect consistent** – Pick **US** or **UK** English and stick with it throughout,
7. **Clean up formatting** – Convert smart quotes to straight quotes, strip weird spaces.

TW for suicide ideation.

Quick facts: my female MC is 17 (stage-2 uni) and turns 18 in two weeks. freshly graduated. They meet two weeks before her 18th birthday — nothing romantic happens then, just three coffee meetups. After she turns 18 they keep things casual for a couple months; the first real shift in feelings is about three months after her 18th birthday. No physical contact until she’s of age for months. She has trauma in her past from losing someone very close to her, and at the start of the story she isn’t looking for romance at all — just trying to survive and make sense of life.

Boy (20): He’s just graduated from university. He’s also traumatized — he was cheated on by his girlfriend of three years, right before he was about to propose, and is basically shattered by it.

Important detail I want feedback on: before her 18th birthday she’s in a really bad place and was seriously planning to end her life. Meeting him — his calm, philosophical, therapist-like presence — is a major reason she doesn’t go through with it. Not because of lust or quick romance, but because he listens, respects her, and gives her a reason to keep going. He’s not a caricature “savior”; he’s flawed, quiet, very mature for his age, into books and philosophy, and genuinely earns her trust.

Questions I want honest takes on:
	1.	Is it problematic that they meet while she’s 17, even though nothing romantic or physical happens until months after she turns 18? Does meeting pre-18 look sketchy to readers, despite the non-romantic nature of those early meetups?

Side note: The reason they didn’t start kissing or being romantic before she turned 18 is not because he was “waiting for her to be legal”, but because romance was literally not on either of their minds at that time.

so, months ago, i had a frightening experience that led me to the ER. i felt like i was dying, tunnel vision, it was intense and scary and i thought something awful was happening. its been a year since then, and ive been trying to figure out if it was something neurological. 

i went to a neurologist recently, and i was told if i had anything similar happen again, we could go ahead and do a ct scan/mri if need be for peace of mind, but she said it was likely a panic attack. but i didnt know what triggered it, out of nowhere? i have an anxiety disorder, but nothing caused it to happen like this.

until today, something similar happen. not to the same intensity, but very similar. i went to a cafe with friends to study, and ordered an espresso flight - likely 400mg of caffeine. AND i took my adhd meds. lots of stimulants. i was fine until we got into the car, and then left to thrift. i felt a similar feeling wash over me, and i had to take deep breaths, calm myself down, i had to hold my hands behind my head because i felt like i was going to implode and felt worse if i didnt. the sense of impending doom was creeping back, and the tunnel vision.

my friend had an espresso flight as well, and he expressed that he didnt feel well either, that he felt lightheaded, the tunnel vision, et cetera. and now i'm realizing, it must have been caffeine?

the day it happened was a road trip. i had no water or food, we left the house, and i had two drinks that had around 70 mg of caffeine, along with a sugary starbucks coffee from a gas station. no food, no water, similar feeling. i had food and water today, beforehand, but what i experienced today wasn't nearly as intense as back then.

I’ve been on vacation for like 3 weeks now. I have a week left but it doesn’t feel like it’s been a vacation. I have family in the area and they are all just over bearing. I understand it’s out of love but I can’t fucking rest at all. 
They wake me up at like 7 am some kid or every adult by knocking and calling my name til I tell them I’m up then 5 mins later again and don’t leave me alone til like 11-12 and even then it’s a begging to stay up and talk and hang out. 
If I stay in silence cause I’m fucking exhausted or just don’t have anything to say they ask me the same questions over and over again. They can’t take no for an answer. I’m not hungry they will force feed me (literally push food into my mouth) I don’t like to much sugar they still put it in my tea and coffee. I try to go to the bathroom someone is right fucking there. 
I’m the type of person who enjoys solitary time. I can’t fucking walk for 2 mins before someone in the area wants to walk with me 😭😭😭 I know it sounds selfish but I’m 2 seconds away from finding a hotel for a couple nights and just putting myself in solitary confinement (literally). I’ve asked them multiple times to let me rest and explained I like to be by myself but they just won’t fucking listen. I’m tired annoyed and just done.

It is not already in the billions(market cap would be higher than ETH for a 1000x) and chances are it is not in the hundreds of millions for similar reasons. However, it could be in the 10s of millions and chances are it probably is.

If we are going off past 1000x's we can narrow the coin down to those with insane hardworking communities, those who are changing the game. 

We see Doge, Shib, Pepe etc and see their success was due to their community efforts and other things but we do not see the fact that they were revolutionary at the time. Following previous footsteps and not innovating is not enough. A project must follow what works and then also build upon the glory of the predecessors. 

**To me the next 1000x is not just a coin that dominates social media, but they must also dominate somewhere else, imo this is IRL.**

This is why my pick for the next 1000x is **Kendu**

**How Kendu Is Dominating Social Media**

Kendu has an insane Reddit presence and can be seen on the altcoin subreddits, scrolling down the feed you're gonna see Kendu everywhere with unmatched engagement, we have the strongest presence on Reddit in the game rn. On Stocktwits and X we are also insanely strong with presence almost everywhere. We keep up with the best on these 2(even those with way higher market caps, this just shows truly how strong the Kendu community is. Our Telegram activity is actually insane as well beating SPX, Mog and Giga over weekly periods!

Yesterday Kendu won the CMC Boost Me competition and we got a shoutout to their 6 million followers on X!

You can see it here: [https://x.com/CoinMarketCap/status/1964981653996175601](https://x.com/CoinMarketCap/status/1964981653996175601)

**How Kendu Is Dominating IRL and Improving On Previous 1000x's Efforts**

Kendu has over 20 IRL efforts and is literally making unprecedented progress, these initiatives are all pushed by the average holder too. Imagine the staggering wave of initiatives that will come at the higher levels so more investment can be made. You can also join and release your own creative dreams under the Kendu umbrella and receive 24/7 engagement.

Retail and investors in general are cautious about investing due to bad actors, but IRL shows that Kendu is different. We are building something physical with real people and this is the most ultimate form of **Proof Of Humanity.**

Here are Kendu's current IRL efforts(I might be forgetting some too):

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!

* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu Jewellery
* Kendu Beer
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks it will be available on Steam and 15% of the profits will be used to buy Kendu for their treasury. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games!
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport
* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 4 festivals. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals! SO much more is coming soon

But some days, especially after making a 2nd pot, I have the need to keep the coffee warm. I am not a fan of heating the coffee back up after it has cooled. I unfortunately the thermal glass carafe does not keep the coffee warm.

I am considering getting a commercial Waring warming plate and my understanding is that I can put the thermal glass carafe right on the warming plate. However, when we have guests and I want to make say 6 cups of coffee, I would like to store it in a high quality thermal carafe to put on the warming plate. 

Do any of you have any recommendations for a carafe? I have considered the Fellow Aiden carafe (pricey) and also considered the Aiden system, but I am not sure of the quality of the brew and also not ready to make the financial leap of purchasing 2 Aiden systems (house + cabin).

           Anyways i left my drag mop leaning up on a small coffee table to remember to take it back to my slop closet at the end of the night so i wouldn't forget. It was locked in a room. This table is very small like maybe a few inches from your ankle. Not for eating or anything of that kind. It used to have game boards and other games on it but was replaced by a shelf unit. Id bet any amount of money that it will either be thrown out or moved to storage. So leaving my drag mop on it standing up i didn't really see a problem with. He takes it and brings it all the way down to his office and hides it under his desk. Later on he comes up to me telling me that this was unacceptable. I didn't really see a problem with that and i pretty pissed off that he decided to take it and then hide it all the way down to his office. I wouldn't do it again but why not just mention it and leave it in the same area and not make some petty point of taking it all the way to his office and out of the area i clean. 
     Just seemed unnecessary and to add tell me about some gum i missed. Like couldn't he have just scraped it up and helped out. How do you walk around without a scraper. Just seems like he is looking for anything to try and reprimand me. Maybe im in the wrong but i feel like he could of just mentioned it to me without taking it and having to go all the way down to his office to get it back and pretend like he didn't know it was mine.

1nh2mvj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nh2mvj,"I created StatePulse — a free, open source platform to track laws and what your reps are actually doing (50 states + Congress)","This might break a rule, but given the current environment of polarization and mis/disinformation, I feel like it's important for everyone to be informed of stuff that's actually happening. Also, who doesn't like FOSS?

* Website: [https://www.statepulse.me/](https://www.statepulse.me/)

I spent the last three months creating StatePulse as a side/summer project! StatePulse updates every day and fetches the latest legislation across different jurisdictions. Uses Google Gemini's API to summarize bills in 100 words, with official source documents attached. Organizes information quickly and intuitively, allowing you to learn what bills your reps are passing (for all fifty states + Congress), and even what your reps voted for (Congress).

If you make a free account, you can enter as many topics/reps you want to subscribe to as possible (i.e. redistricting) and StatePulse will send updates at 9:00 AM PST on bills introduced with that description if they come up.

You can also search for your representatives and view cool visualizations with the interactive dashboard.

StatePulse's purpose is to serve as a place for organized, easily accessible content. The summaries generated by Gemini come directly from the bill text whenever possible, then the human written abstracts.

Everyone should have access to what's actually being passed in legislative chambers, especially considering how heated stuff is right now. As an incoming college freshman majoring in Computer Science, I think technology is a great aid in helping regular folks like me be more civically engaged.

1. Pack your normal amount of undies and socks. Then double it- trust me! We walked 14K-21K steps/day. Our general daily schedule was: 
- coffee & pastry
- museum or excursion & LOTS of walking
- back to hotel to rest & shower
- dinner

2. Have confidence when using the metro (scanning your ticket & pushing through the turnstile and metal door). If you validate your ticket and don’t make it through, you can’t swipe again like other metros. Idk how long you have to wait to try again but it’s a while and we needed to buy another card from the machinewhen it happened. 

3. If you like Monet, add Musée Marmottan Monet to your list. It’s a bit out of the way but has way less crowds than the Louvre, D’Orsay, and L’Orangerie. Marmottan has some of Monet’s most famous works- including Sunrise (where Impressionism got its name)! They also had an incredible exhibit of works by one of the only female impressionist painters, Berthe Morisot.

I cannot help but to get triggered and compare my situation to hers. 

I have been 24/7 caregiving for my bedbound mother at home since this April and before that I visited her in the hospital every day from Jan to April. In comparison to other people in this sub that is not a long time at all, but it is the longest time that I have ever done this for. 

I even try to not go onto Instagram too often as I feel like I am missing out on so much life. Getting directly sent 'updates' like this feels like a slap in the face. I had to move away from my partner and our home. We are still together and he is supportive but it is still hard to do long distance again. We had just gotten to move in together and enjoyed that for less than 6 months. Then my mother finally goes to the doctor after years of debilitating hip pain (stage 4 cancer all over her little frail skeleton), couple weeks later has a bone breaking fall and ended up in hospital and in palliative care. 

I do not want to see these holiday images of happy people sitting outside in a warm evening setting drinking cocktails and having fun. The cute outfits she wears and the done up nails hair and makeup. I try to close myself away from all of this as I already have so much FOMO. 

This girl knows exactly what my life is like and how my only outings are to get groceries and a very rare coffee date with a friend. I can work from home luckily. 

I wouldnt send these images to a friend who cant travel anywhere. I love my mum and will care for her until she moves on, but that doesnt take away the fact that this is a massive sacrifice. 

Am I overreacting? How to calm down?
Thanks guys

Edit: just to clarify, this is not about missing out on life, that I have fully accepted. We are all missing out on some life, but having these pictures sent to me when knowing exactly what my situation is like is infuriating.

1nh2kjz,https://youtu.be/iTkrBlVSIFw,"I found ""Clark Kent's"" cousin.  Who knew!!! [This is about a drama but more the actor specifically. 😁]","The things that grab my attention....
1) Title.
2) Thumbnail art.
3) Name recognition if one is listed (but I have a bad memory for face/name association so...yeah... not a thing that counts for much.)

But sometimes intuition or the 'forces of nature and the gods' kick in and I go ahead and click on a random video.  This is what happened this time.  1) Title is in Chinese, 2) thumbnail art was nothing spectacular, and 3) no actor name recognition because see #1.

But I clicked anyway.  Holy Smokes!  Was I rewarded less than 5 minutes into the drama.  Let's just say, there is water, muscles, wet muscles, no shirt, wet.... yeah.  I think you get the picture.  If you don't, have a cup of coffee... or you need the extra sleep. 😁

Further viewing reveals that it's a repeated story theme of an FL wanting to sell her eggs (the ovarian type, not chickens) to benefit the mother (who one wants to unceremoniously) drop-kick into the next drama (because every drama needs one, right!)  Anyway, the ML is the doctor (in the title), potential buyer of said eggs, and the owner of the no-shirt-wet-bod 🔥.

I ~~think~~ now know the ML is ~~Song Chen~~ **Huang Bo** [courtesy of u/thehepburn] and I'll add that the MDL profile pic once again strikes out on being a help in identification.  I've seen him in a few other dramas [when the ML was Song Chen], but it was literally a drive-by peek.  Nothing that grabbed me and made me want to explore and possibly finish.  But I may have had my mind changed with this drama. And, I could have prematurely dropped out of the previous dramas before the visual eye-candy made an appearance, so this is on me.

I'm not familiar with the FL actress so she only gets this one-sentence blurb.  Plus, I don't have the time to comb through Song Chen's filmography to try and figure this one out. But does one really need to know the name of every star in the sky to appreciate a night-time sky?

I haven't watched the whole drama but if there is more of the first five minutes, I'm in for the long-haul.

1nh2h6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatItsLike/comments/1nh2h6e/explore_if_capture_carpet_cleaner_truly_removes/,Explore If Capture Carpet Cleaner Truly Removes Pet Stains Fast,"Testing the Capture 3000004612 Carpet Cleaner has been an enlightening experience for someone like me who constantly deals with the chaos of pets, kids, and everyday messes. This dry carpet cleaner powder is a lifesaver when it comes to maintaining the cleanliness of my home without the hassle of liquid solutions or professional services. Its promise to banish odors, tackle tough stains, and work effectively on various surfaces immediately caught my attention, and I couldn’t resist giving it a try.

**Design and Packaging**  
The design of this product is simple yet effective. The 1 lb pail is lightweight, making it easy to carry and handle as you clean. This powder comes with a brush which, although basic, gets the job done reasonably well. I especially appreciated that the packaging isn't bulky, so it’s easy to store in a closet or under the sink. Opting for a compact design doesn't mean compromising on performance, though. This little container is capable of cleaning up to 100 square feet in one sitting, which came in handy for my living room area after my dog decided to sprint in with muddy paws.

**Ease of Use**  
What really makes this cleaner a standout choice is its ease of use. The instructions were straightforward: spray a pre-treatment solution (sold separately) on the stained area, sprinkle the powder, gently brush it in, and vacuum after some time. I’ve tested it on everything from pet stains to coffee spills, and each time the steps worked like a charm. It’s a dry application, so there’s no risk of soaking your carpet and waiting eternities for it to dry. Honestly, that feature alone sold me, especially for days when I need to clean up quickly before guests arrive.

**Key Benefits**  
- Safe for all types of carpets, including delicate fabrics like wool and Code S materials.  
- Works well on various surfaces beyond carpets, like upholstery, couches, and car interiors.  
- Doesn’t leave moisture behind, avoiding the issue of wicking where stains resurface.  

[Check Capture 3000004612 Carpet Cleaner price on Amazon.](https://info.sanue.com/p/b003kvi512/)

- Eliminates odors effectively, which is ideal for homes with animals.  
- 100% bleach-free and free from harsh chemicals, making it safe to use around pets and kids.  
- Proudly made in the USA, which for me adds extra trustworthiness.  

**Performance and Results**  
This carpet cleaner’s performance genuinely impressed me. After accidentally spilling a glass of red wine on the living room rug, I put it to the test without much hope (let’s face it, red wine on a light carpet usually means game over). Following the instructions, I sprinkled the powder onto the stain, brushed it in gently with the provided brush, and vacuumed thoroughly. To my relief, the stain was almost magically gone, and there was no lingering smell as a reminder of my clumsiness. It even worked wonders on older pet stains I’d tried everything to remove before.  

**Shortcomings**  
Like any product, this one isn’t without its faults, though they didn’t take away too much from my overall satisfaction.  
- You need to purchase the pre-treatment spray separately, which feels slightly inconvenient if you don’t already have it.  
- The brush could benefit from a better ergonomic design. After extended use, it felt a bit unwieldy in my hand.  
- Stubborn or pretty old stains may require multiple applications, which may seem a bit labor-intensive.  

**Competitive Products**  
In my cleaning arsenal, I’ve tried quite a few products like the Resolve Carpet Cleaner and OxiClean Carpet & Area Rug Stain Remover. While both do a decent job, neither provided the level of satisfaction I found with this dry powder approach. Liquid cleaners leave behind dampness, increasing the risk of stains coming back after drying, and they often take longer to show results. Some alternatives also have an overwhelming chemical smell, while this cleaner only leaves behind a fresh and subtle scent.

One competitor product that did intrigue me was Woolite’s Advanced Stain & Odor Remover. It’s great for spot treatments and works faster on small-scale stains. But compared to the Capture 3000004612 Carpet Cleaner, Woolite didn’t seem as reliable for larger areas or for more persistent odors. This dry powder cleaner simply feels like a more versatile solution overall.

**Price Performance**  
Given the effortlessness and effectiveness of this product, its price is quite reasonable compared to professional carpet cleaning services or more “luxury” branded stain removers. Sure, the initial investment might seem a bit higher since you’ll need the additional pre-treatment bottle, but this product more than makes up for it in durability and results. A single pail lasted me through numerous uses, and it worked equally well on my living room carpet and car upholstery, so I didn’t feel the need to keep purchasing separate cleaners for different surfaces. Its cost-efficiency wins hands down.

1nh2gw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1nh2gw7/excess_chaffe_at_city/,Excess chaffe at city+ ?,"Hi folks,

I've been roasting at home for nearly 2 decades, most of that time using an OG Gene Cafe. 

In that time, I've generally favored Guatemalan beans, targeting a city+ / full city roast. 

I'm generally in search of a very well balanced, low-acidity cup, favoring nut & caramel notes, and appreciable sweetness. That said, I do find some brighter fruity notes and distinctive flavors appealing as well. 

In pursuit of this, I've traditionally set the Gene Cafe temp at its max (482 degrees) for a 13.4 minute roast duration and let it do it's thing.. though I'll always try to check back around 2min before it ends to watch, smell and listen.. often ending the roast if/when I start to hear a distinctive 2nd crack. 

I generally prefer brewing my own roasts with an Aeropress to most accessible coffees outside the house. Before I took up roasting I was buying freshly roasted beans from Intelligentsia, and did not detect a substantial drop in enjoyment when I made the switch to home roasting. 

All that being said, I still often prefer a well made Americano.. and have finally decided to invest in a home espresso setup to see if I can improve my coffee at home.  This recent shift has also inspired me to review my current habits & workflow to see if there's anything I can do to dial in my current brew setup.

I guess my first question is, are you seeing too much chaffe on the bean? I understand that the chaffe in the seam is expected in lighter roasts, but as you can see in the photo, I also tend to retain some on the bean itself.  Could this be a sign that I'm under-roasting? Alternatively, is there anything I can or should be doing to remove the excess chaffe post-roast? 

  
Thank you!

ps. 

also, If it's even possible to determine, would you consider this a light or medium roast?

* Website: [https://www.statepulse.me/](https://www.statepulse.me/)

I spent the last three months creating StatePulse as a side/summer project! StatePulse updates every day and fetches the latest legislation across different jurisdictions. Uses Google Gemini's API to summarize bills in 100 words, with official source documents attached. Organizes information quickly and intuitively, allowing you to learn what bills your reps are passing (for all fifty states + Congress), and even what your reps voted for (Congress).

If you make a free account, you can enter as many topics/reps you want to subscribe to as possible (i.e. redistricting) and StatePulse will send updates at 9:00 AM PST on bills introduced with that description if they come up.

You can also search for your representatives and view cool visualizations with the interactive dashboard.

StatePulse's purpose is to serve as a place for organized, easily accessible content. The summaries generated by Gemini come directly from the bill text whenever possible, then the human written abstracts.

Everyone should have access to what's actually being passed in legislative chambers, especially considering how heated stuff is right now. As an incoming college freshman majoring in Computer Science, I think technology is a great aid in helping regular folks like me be more civically engaged.

Zable are doing a £10 statement credit for new cardholders once you’re approved and make one normal purchase—nothing wild, but it’s easy if you pay it off straight away.

**Why I find it useful:**

* Handy for “just in case” stuff: hotels, car hire deposits, online bookings that prefer a real credit line over debit—plus Zable’s app gives you a virtual card so you don’t have to wait on the post to make your first qualifying purchase.
* It’s aimed at building or rebuilding credit, so a small weekly shop and paying in full can add positive credit history.

**What you actually do**

* Apply for the Zable credit card and pass their checks. Activate the physical card when it arrives or use the virtual card in‑app.
* Make one normal purchase (keep it simple—groceries/coffee but skip gift cards, gambling or transfers ), then wait for the £10 statement credit. They say up to 30 days, but mine came way sooner.

If there’s a stronger public no‑reference Zable deal floating around, use that instead

**P.S. if you enjoy checking your credit score, the Zable app gives you free access to your Equifax credit report along with rent reporting for building credit score.**

Second, build a new button layout in a test menu: group by outcomes like Coffee, Tea, Cold, Food, and add forced modifiers only where choices are required, such as milk, size, temp. Third, print a one page map that mirrors the new layout so new hires learn it in minutes; laminate it and tape it near the register. Optional but strong: add short names to kitchen chits so tickets read GrCapp 12oz Oat instead of a wall of text.

Pricing that hits the first $100 fast is simple. Offer a Starter Tidy at $120 for one register and up to 30 items, delivered weeknights in two hours. Add $30 for each extra 20 items, $20 to laminate two cheat sheets, and $25 to align kitchen printer categories. A single cafe with 24 items and one printer is $120 to $145, often booked after a five minute demo at the counter.

Caveats and risks: do not touch a live menu during rush; schedule after close and export a backup first. Ask for an owner pin and confirm tax and reporting settings with them before you publish. If a third party consultant built the system, expect politics; deliver your plan as a test menu they can copy rather than editing theirs.

Would you tweak the offer toward flat pricing or keep the add ons, and what proof would convince an owner at 7 a.m. to book you for that night?",1,1757882207.0,TheSideMoneyShow,1,1.0,False

Says he needs to play since he only makes 350k a year but is single income with wife and 3 kids in probably the most expensive part of the US.

He’s so passive I tell him he doesn’t really have a chance unless some how his game selection is great.  

Game is 5-5 with a 300-500 buyin, it’s like 5am and this table is super fishy passive he has about 600. 

UTG straddles to 10 and 3 other limpers come (all have 300-600), he’s on the button with A9o and joins as does the 2 blinds.  

After the hand I tell him he has no business considering this a side job, he has the button with probably the best hand and a decent amount of blinds in the pot, he has make it heads up or 2 other players max.  He 100% thinks his limp is correct and he’s “won 8 weekend in a row” so he doesn’t want to take my advice.  

My advice is he’s too passive and what he’s earning/hour is nothing compared to his real job skill set and he’s wasting his time considering the opportunity cost and how chicken he is  playing buyins .1% of his salary.  He says he doesn’t actually enjoy the poker or drive to the room but makes an extra 4k a month

I used to play online 6 handed, and sit n go in college and it paid for my college for 4+ years but that was almost 2 decades ago.   I have played like 2x in the last 15+ years.

If I send an email, it will not be read by the priest but his secretary - I feel uncomfortable discussing personal issues with her.

I can’t always stay for coffee hour and even then, how am I supposed to discuss anything I need advice with, with the priest? 

I have two children under 4, and they barely make the thorough 30 mins let alone the full liturgy, and then coffee hour :,) 

I’m so confused. Sometimes I wish I was Protestant because it seems much easier to obtain spiritual guidance in the U.K. 

Currently - and this isn’t good - I rely on the orthodox ChatGPT for help when I need it, it replies, it’s more confidential (I know there’s a court case for openAI) than sending a highly personal email to the secretary. 

My priest has a day job as a lawyer, so I don’t think he has a great deal of time to meet or talk anyway. 

Does anyone else feel this way? What do you do, how do you manage without spiritual direction? I feel so alone spiritually.

I’m thinking of just joining a Bible study group with any denomination just to have more spiritual contact with a priest.

I have been friends with Ed (26M) for 11 years; he is the closest thing I feel Ive had to a soul mate. We can read each other's minds, love all the same things etc. We attempted to date once a year into our friendship, but we just wanted different things AND Ed was questioning his sexuality. Sucked at first, but managed to move past it into a great friendship; we've both been in multiple dedicated relationships since then.

I have been dating Steve (29M) for 1.5 years; I have never felt so appreciated and safe in any other relationship. Steve and I are going to Greece in a week; it was accidently spoiled to me a few months ago that he is planning to propose to me (his grandpa got confused and thought it already happened, congratulating me early). I love imagining/planning a future and family with him. 

Steve and Ed aren't super close friends, but get along really well; I sometimes feel like the 3rd wheel when they play games or build legos together. Steve knows of the history of my friendship with Ed; he confidently tells me he doesnt feel threatened at all by Ed, nor does he yet any bad vibes from him. 

So, over the weekend, I went to pick up Ed for a mutuals Bachelorette party. While waiting for him, his mom came up to me and said ""You need to get back together with Ed"". Now, his mom has struggled with Ed's journey with sexuality; these comments werent foreign, but it had been a very long time since she'd said anything. We thought she finally caught a clue. So as we're driving, I voice my annoyance at the disrespect; Ed is clearly annoyed, too. Fast forward to this morning, Ed invites me to coffee (not unusual for a Sunday). It is there he says something along these lines to me: 

""The reason mom brought that up is because Ive really been struggling with the news you're getting engaged. I wasnt going to say anything, but I'm now scared Ill regret it if I don't; I am in love with you. I have been the last few years. But i also want to make it clear that I know life isnt a movie; I'm not telling you this so you'll leave Steve. I'm telling you because I feel guilty; I like Steve and can tell you love him. I can tell hes good for you, better than I ever could be. Most days I accept that loving you as my best friend is what's healthiest for you; but some days I feel like a snake, and hate myself for it. I WANT you to talk to Steve about this; please dont hide this from him. Id be more than happy to talk about it, too. I acknowledge the feelings may be louder rn because I'm lonely, and you're the safest constant in my life. I dont want to lose you as my best friend, I dont want to steal you for Steve or lose him as a friend. But I also dont want to feel like scum anymore, and feel i need to be honest. I promise its not the only reason we're friends; I would never just keep you around as a back up love interest."" 

I do plan to Steve. And knowing him he'll just be like ""Oh, okay"" and go about his day, trusting both me and Ed's words.
But I feel so much dread, now; what am I supposed to do? Cut Ed off and lose my best friend ever? Not marry Steve to save my best friends freelings? Risk it and see how things turn out? I feel terrible because I feel I technically forced this confession out of him by telling him what his mom said.

TL;DR Best friend of 11 years told me he's loved me for years; mostly told me because he felt guilty (I believe him). Have no idea what to do with this info and friendship, other than talk to Steve when he comes home from work. Has anyone had a similar dynamic where everything turned out okay?

The first thing I noticed upon picking up the Dawn Gentle Clean EZ-Squeeze Dishwashing Liquid was the clever design. This pomegranate and rose water-scented soap comes in a squeezable bottle without a flip cap, which, as mundane as it sounds, made a significant difference in my everyday dish-cleaning routine. Having used a variety of dish soaps in the past, the ""no flip, no mess"" cap caught me by surprise. It’s such a simple idea, but it’s incredibly convenient when your hands are wet or covered in grease. Just grab, squeeze, and it flows precisely as needed. No cap juggling, no accidently dripping soap everywhere. Someone in design clearly had their coffee that day.

**User Experience and Scent**

The scent is another standout feature for this soap. The blend of pomegranate and rose water transforms what could be a mundane task into something far more pleasant. I’ve never thought I’d enjoy the aroma of dish soap wafting up from the sink, but this one did it for me. Washing dishes suddenly feels a little less like a chore, thanks to that faint, fresh fragrance. My kids even jokingly said it smells nicer than some of their expensive shower gels. Of course, scent is subjective, but even my coworker, who’s notoriously picky about fragrances, gave it a begrudging thumbs-up.

**Performance**

Performance-wise, it lives up to expectations. It advertises ""50% less scrubbing compared to Dawn Non-Concentrated,"" and while I didn’t conduct any scientific experiments with grease stains, it did seem to cut through oil and stuck-on grime faster than other brands I’ve used. After hosting a large family dinner involving lasagna (read: nightmare cleanup), the Dawn Gentle Clean dish soap tackled the baked-on cheese like a champ. I paired it with my trusty sponge, and within minutes, the results spoke for themselves. Plus, the soap didn’t aggravate my hands—something I appreciated since some other brands end up leaving me with dry or itchy skin during the winter months.

**Positives**

• The no-mess, easy-squeeze bottle design  
• Gentle formula that’s kind on hands  
• Effective grease-fighting capabilities with minimal scrubbing  
• Delightful pomegranate and rose water scent that doesn’t overpower  

**Negatives**

• The squeezable design can lead to accidental over-dispensing if you’re not careful  
• Not as highly concentrated as some other heavy-duty dish soaps  
• Pricier than generics, which might deter budget-conscious buyers  

[Check Dawn Gentle Clean EZ-Squeeze Dishwashing Liquid price on Amazon.](https://check.sanue.com/p/b0dfpgfrtr/)

**Product Rivals**

While the Dawn Gentle Clean dish soap has several winning points, it faces tough competition from brands like Palmolive and Seventh Generation. Palmolive’s Ultra Strength tacky grease-removing formula works wonders for particularly stubborn jobs, but it lacks the sophistication of Dawn’s no-flip packaging. Seventh Generation, on the other hand, appeals to environmentally conscious users with its biodegradable ingredients and eco-friendly mission. However, it doesn’t perform as well on heavy-duty grease as Dawn does. Compared to these competitors, Dawn wins with its balance of practical design, stellar performance, and an appealing scent.

**Value for Money**

Given its performance and user-friendly design, this dish soap offers solid value. While it’s slightly more expensive than standard alternatives, the reduced effort in scrubbing and the overall experience make it a worthy investment for daily dishwashing tasks. For households juggling various chores, these time-saving details add up. I'd categorize this product as affordable quality—it sits comfortably between premium soaps and supermarket generics, giving you the best of both worlds without breaking the bank.

Diagnosed last year and my doctor told me to eat with my medikinet CR (ritalin), titrated to 40mg from 20 and i have a booster dose 20mg CR to take after 5-6 hrs.  
From what i noticed my booster always works (so i can get productive and work after said 5 hours) but no matter what i eat, how much i eat, if i eat after / before meds, the first dose just never works, it makes me feel kinda unmotivated and iritable.  
I can't stand the idea that i'm wasting 5 hours being completely useless everyday just because i can't seem to figure out why it's happening.  
Today i had 3 boiled eggs + protein shake 40 minutes before the meds and it felt terrible, felt like the meds got delayed / blunted / ir didn't even work.

Generally when i'm on the first dose i feel it's harder to breath and generally more anxious but once i take the booster i'm super chill and everything's amazing.

Can it be that my first dose is just not enough to reach a terapeutic effect and the booster just gets me above that threshhold?

We live in a rural area and our acreage has significant timber. The pack is Loki, Odin (gp’s) SamSam the golden. Two yorkies and a husky…..who is zero help in an emergency. 
We have lights along the fence (about 1.5 acres for dogs to run/roam). Things went as usual, let dogs out, make coffee. Then all breaks lose. The yorkies are screaming and Loki is going batshit-crazy. He is actually the guardian. Odin tries his best to be tough but Loki is ""The Dog"".  By the time I get my boots on and out to the back there is one dead owl and two very excited Pyrs. FYI, both yorkies were safe and un injured. I’ve never seen an owl up close but, damn, those things are ginormous! 

I called animal control to report the incident. They were really impressed that Loki was able to Neutralize the owl. It was a great horned owl apparently and known as a predator of cats and small dogs. 

So just an fyi for ya’ll. Death can come from above.

Alt text: Corporate professionals discussing business plans in a modern office setting., understanding these locational benefits is essential to making the right move.\
My personal experience with Bahrain’s business environment showed me that beyond the sleek skyscrapers and glossy brochures, the kingdom offers unique logistical, economic, and cultural advantages few places in the Gulf can match.\
Bahrain’s Business Environment in 2025: A Snapshot\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting showing a Middle East business district., Bahrain ranks in the top tier for ease of doing business in the GCC, with reforms accelerating company registrations and simplifying labor and ownership laws. Reuters reports GDP growth projections for Bahrain at around 3.8% for 2025, driven largely by diversification efforts and financial services expansion.\
The government continues investing heavily in infrastructure, including the Bahrain Bay development and the expansion of Bahrain International Airport, increasing connectivity and opening new business corridors. The recently launched Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB) plays a proactive role, promoting the kingdom as a gateway for regional and global markets.\
Importantly, the accessibility of Bahrain’s financial and commercial hubs—such as the Diplomatic Area and Seef District—offers companies unparalleled proximity to government entities, banks, and multinational corporations. This strategic clustering saves time and money during the crucial setup phase.\
Strategic Location: The Core Advantages\
1. Gateway to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)\
Bahrain is uniquely poised as a logistical and commercial gateway to the 6-member GCC, including Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar. Its connectivity through the King Fahd Causeway directly links Bahrain to the eastern provinces of Saudi Arabia, creating a seamless trade and travel corridor.\
\
Being just 25 km from the Saudi border means companies can easily manage cross-border logistics and tap into the world's 4th largest oil export market without the usual trade barriers or customs delays.\
\
This proximity allows businesses in Bahrain to serve the wider Gulf market without incurring the higher costs and operational challenges often encountered in larger economies. It’s an ideal base for distribution, regional sales offices, and even manufacturing hubs targeting the Gulf.\
2. Excellent Infrastructure and Connectivity\
Bahrain’s investment in modern infrastructure enhances its locational advantage:\
\
Bahrain Financial Harbour hosts numerous international banks, law firms, and consultancy hubs, offering a comprehensive ecosystem for finance and corporate services.\
Bahrain International Airport recently expanded its cargo handling capacity by 40%, facilitating faster import-export cycles.\
Access to the nearby Khalifa Bin Salman Port serves as a vital maritime hub, ranked among the fastest growing in the Middle East.\
\
Surprisingly, Bahrain’s telecom infrastructure is among the best in the region, which is crucial for technology companies and startups. The government supports this with initiatives like the Bahrain Information and eGovernment Authority (iGA), ensuring high-speed data availability and smart city projects.\
3. Business-Friendly Regulatory Framework\
Bahrain’s strategic location is also complemented by progressive regulations designed to attract foreign investment. The 2025 update to the Commercial Companies Law allows for greater foreign ownership—up to 100% in many sectors (read more) —which is exceptional in the Gulf region.\
\
From my direct dealings with Bahrain’s Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (MOICT), the commercial registration (Sijilat) process has become streamlined, cutting the usual waiting time by half. Utilizing this advantage requires a clear understanding of the local nuances.\
\
This openness creates a straightforward path for foreign investors, reducing dependency on local sponsors (details on sponsorship) and increasing autonomy in running operations.\
4. Competitive Cost Structure and Tax Benefits\
In 2025, Bahrain still stands out with one of the lowest business setup and operational costs in the GCC. The corporate tax rate remains at zero for most sectors, except oil and gas. Officials have also frozen VAT increases despite regional trends, keeping the tax environment attractive.\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and cost calculation using a calculator and financial documents.). Office rents vary, with premium locations like Bahrain Bay commanding around 800-1000 BHD monthly for small office spaces, whereas Seef District offers more affordable options around 300-500 BHD.\
Cost-conscious entrepreneurs benefit by selecting free zones (free zones advantages) where licensing fees and labor sponsorship are further subsidized. This strategic cost management makes Bahrain a smart choice for startups and SMEs.\
Bahrain Company Formation: Practical Guidance\
Step 1: Choose the Right Business Structure\
Understanding the right business type is crucial. Bahrain offers:\
\
Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)\
Joint stock companies\
Branch offices of foreign companies\
Sole proprietorships\
\
From my experience, LLCs are the most common due to limited personal liability and flexible ownership. Foreign investors can now own up to 99% or 100% depending on sector (ownership options).\
Step 2: Prepare Documents and Apply\
Having all documents ready—including passport copies, business plans, proof of address—is time-saving. Insider tip: Submit your application mid-week, as weekends and Fridays slow down processing.\
\
Obtain commercial registration via Sijilat online portal\
Register with the Labor Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA) for work permits\
Apply for municipal licenses depending on business activities\
\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation workflow.). Bahrain’s regulatory agencies expect thorough documentation, especially for VAT and labor law adherence.\
Bahrain’s Location Compared to UAE and Saudi Arabia\
Although Dubai and Riyadh attract major global players, Bahrain’s smaller size and more nimble bureaucracy often mean faster turnaround times. Business culture here is a blend of modern professionalism and traditional hospitality. For instance, networks form over traditional majlis meetings, and understanding Ramadan’s business hour changes is essential.\
The cost benefits and increasing foreign ownership rights give Bahrain a competitive edge, especially for fintech, education, and manufacturing sectors.\
Unexpected Tangent: Bahrain’s Coffee Culture and Business Networking\
While seemingly off-topic, Bahrain’s traditional coffee rituals—served during meetings—reflect a patient and relationship-focused approach to business. This cultural element, embedded in its strategic location, fosters trust and long-term partnerships essential for success in the Gulf.\
Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them\
A frequent mistake I witnessed was underestimating the importance of proper documentation and local relationship-building during company formation. Entrepreneurs often overlook applying for certain municipal permits early, causing delays.\
Solution: Hire a local consultant who understands the process (professional support) and leverage government e-services. Timing your application submissions to avoid local holidays, especially Ramadan, also saves weeks.\
\
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\
1. How long does company formation in Bahrain usually take?\
Typically, the process takes around 7 to 14 working days if all documents are complete. Using online registration platforms like Sijilat accelerates this further. For detailed procedural steps, visit the Bahrain company formation process.\
2. Can foreigners have 100% ownership of a company in Bahrain?\
Yes, Bahrain's updated laws allow 100% foreign ownership in many sectors. This progressive policy is detailed at foreigner-friendly ownership.\
3. What are the best locations for setting up an office in Bahrain?\
For prestige and accessibility, Bahrain Financial Harbour, Bahrain Bay, and the Diplomatic Area are top picks. Seef District offers budget-friendly alternatives. Consider proximity to government offices and client bases when deciding.\
4. What are the typical costs involved in Bahrain company formation?\
Costs start from around 500 BHD for registration and licensing but can increase depending on business type and office location. More info on budgeting is provided at company formation costs.\
5. What compliance services should I budget for after company formation?\
Accounting, bookkeeping, VAT registration, and labor law compliance are ongoing requirements. Professional services, such as those available here, are highly recommended to avoid penalties.\
\
Bahrain’s strategic location presents a strong proposition for entrepreneurs and investors aiming to establish a foothold in the Gulf. Coupled with a favorable regulatory framework and competitive costs, it’s no wonder the kingdom continues to attract business leaders from across the globe.\

It is the middle of September and autumn🍂 is on the horizon. I want to find a special connection with someone that wants to grow with me.

I would describe myself as a thoughtful person who enjoys having deep conversations and having a good time. I'm a 6'5"" black guy with an athletic build who is based in London. I wear glasses as well😎 as I was not blessed with perfect eyesight!

In my 9-5 job, I'm working in tech as a data analyst/data engineer so I have the turtleneck. Unfortunately I can't beat the corporate allegations😂. I do enjoy working in London but I can see myself worling abroad one day for sure. The opportunity to experience new things appeals to me and I'm learning Spanish as well🇪🇸.

In my spare time, I love being active. I’m into hiking, gym and bouldering. It sounds like a lot but I find a way to live life in a wild way. Also, I enjoy reading books as it is the best way to calm my mind after a long day. I would love some recommendations and my favourite genre is fantasy📚.

In the near future, I'm planning to go on holiday✈️ so I would love to have some recommendations for travel destinations. At the moment, I have Amsterdam🇳🇱, Brussels🇧🇪 and Porto🇵🇹 on my list.

At the moment, I’m open to long distance if the energy feels right, but I’d love for it to eventually lead to something in person. This could be coffee dates, museum days, getting food together, or just wandering around the city.

1nh1lrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayTechTried/comments/1nh1lrr/should_you_buy_the_best_drip_coffee_maker/,Should You Buy the Best Drip Coffee Maker Hamilton Beach 46299,"Hamilton Beach 46299 is a product that easily found its way into my morning routine. I never thought I'd look forward to brewing coffee more than the coffee itself, but this programmable coffee maker did just that. With its sleek black and stainless accents, it sits proudly on my kitchen countertop, giving both form and function. As someone who prioritizes simplicity and efficiency in appliances, this one really hits the mark.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that stands out is the design of this coffee maker. It’s modern and compact enough to fit snugly on most countertops without taking up too much space. The black finish combined with stainless accents gives it a premium look, even though the product itself is budget-friendly. Its lightweight nature makes it easy to move if needed, although I doubt you'd want to hide it away. All the buttons and controls are placed ergonomically, meaning programming the machine is straightforward even on groggy mornings. Despite its attractive look, I did wish the buttons were a bit more tactile, as they felt slightly flimsy during use.

**Ease of Use and Programmability**  
The programmability feature of this coffee maker feels like a lifesaver on busy mornings. With the ability to program it up to 24 hours in advance, you can wake up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee—all without lifting a finger. The Easy-Touch programming makes the setup intuitive, and I had no trouble setting the timer for my 6:30 am wake-up call. My kids joked that I was more excited about programming my mornings than anything else, but they enjoyed watching me avoid my usual frantic coffee rush. That said, older users or those unfamiliar with programming appliances might take a couple of tries to understand the settings.

**Good Points**  
- The Select-a-Brew feature provides three brew strength options—regular, bold, and a 1-4 cup setting—making it perfect for adjusting coffee flavor preferences.  
- The Auto Pause & Pour feature stood out for me. Being able to sneak a cup before the brewing process ends is a game-changer, especially during chaotic mornings.  
- Cleanup is a breeze since the glass carafe and brew basket are dishwasher-safe. The nonstick warming plate wipes clean with little effort.  
- The programming and 2-hour automatic shut-off feature make this coffee maker incredibly user-friendly.

**Areas for Improvement**  
While there’s much to love about this coffee maker, a few aspects could be better.  
- The water reservoir could benefit from clearer markings. Though I got the hang of it after a few uses, newcomers might initially find it tricky to measure accurately.  
- The machine uses a paper filter system. While it’s convenient for some, I personally prefer a reusable filter option to reduce waste.  
- Though the cord storage feature is thoughtful, the cord itself felt shorter than expected, limiting placement flexibility in my kitchen.

**Performance and Brewing Experience**  
Every cup I brewed with this machine delivered an evenly-extracted flavor. The coffee strength was consistent thanks to the Select-a-Brew function. My co-worker, who prefers a slightly bolder taste, tried it and admitted she was impressed with the depth of the bold setting. I also tried the 1-4 cup feature a few times and was amazed at how it maintained the same richness as a full pot. The warming plate kept my coffee hot for up to two hours without any noticeable change in taste—a detail that speaks volumes on quality. However, for hardcore coffee enthusiasts, the lack of advanced brewing options might feel limiting.

**Market Rivals**  
Compared to other drip coffee makers like the Black+Decker CM1160B or the Cuisinart DCC-3200P1, this one finds a sweet spot between affordability and features. The simplicity of its controls and the programmability are comparable to pricier models, while the glass carafe ensures you retain the traditional drip coffee maker feel. Black+Decker models might have better tactile buttons, but they fall behind in styling and brew strength variations. Cuisinart counterparts, on the other hand, offer reusable filters but with a slightly higher price tag. As a middle-ground choice, this programmable coffee maker wins for its practicality and user-centric features without breaking the bank.

**True Value**  
From a cost perspective, this drip coffee maker delivers excellent value. Considering it includes features like a 24-hour programmability timer, multiple brew strength options, and a 2-hour automatic shutoff, it exceeds expectations for its price point. You might find comparable products with stainless steel carafes or additional programmable settings, but they often cost significantly more. For a daily coffee machine that does the essentials extremely well, I’d argue it’s more than worth the investment. If you’re seeking convenience and reliable performance without stretching your budget, this product should be high on your list.

1nh1ivi,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1nh1ivi/after_years_of_artificial_confidence_a_trip_led/,"After years of 'artificial' confidence, a trip led to a final showdown with my childhood trauma. I feel like I'm finally free.","As many of you probably know, the trauma inflicted on you during your childhood is often invisible. You don't realize the effects it has on you at the time—you're just a kid. I was a recluse up until 18-19 for many reasons, but I managed to gradually make social improvements and better myself little by little over the years. I was going out as much as I could, hitting the gym regularly, trying to follow advice online, etc.

However, it was all built on a foundation of that trauma. Sure, I felt confident sometimes and I could kind of fit in, but looking back, it felt like I was artificially adapting. I often didn't even enjoy what I was doing, whether at a party or a hangout. People could sometimes notice a sense of 'stiffness' and strangeness about me.

Just a few days ago, I went on an 8-day holiday in Sunny Beach, Bulgaria (one of the most degen places you can be) with two buddies I trust a lot. I was put way further out of my comfort zone than I could ever imagine, through a mix of shitty, hilarious, sad, funny, awesome, and horrible situations. Each time I stepped out of my comfort zone, I felt like I was getting closer to the core fear buried deep in my brain. I could physically feel it.

I'm an extremely introspective person, and I was desperate to fight the negative feeling I constantly felt. I knew my brain was sending out false signals of fear and ""fight or flight"" responses, and I wanted to fucking stare that fear in its face for a final showdown. My thought process was, ""Either I shut down in despair after this trip, or perhaps I will be better off somehow. All I know is that this hidden despair needs to end.""

Near the end of the trip, I stayed mostly sober—only coffee. I knew I wanted to meet my feelings head-on without any substances hindering me. And it worked. I felt fully desensitized, doing things I would've NEVER dreamed of doing on alcohol before, let alone sober. The imposter syndrome afterward was fucking crazy, it's so hard to describe. I've been communicating with an AI (Gemini) about these psychological intricacies, and I guess it's just a normal process when you literally rewire the fundamental functioning of your brain when it comes to fear and social situations.

My conclusion is that this fear was 100% a result of my childhood trauma. I was unaccepted for who I was because I was simply a bit of a weird and unusual kid, and I didn't have a father figure to guide me, so I just coped by being a NEET. It feels crazy that I never realized the full extent of this trauma during my self-betterment journey these past few years. It seems so fucking obvious now.

This feeling I have now is exactly like when I was a kid—free from the fear of being who I am—except now I'm intelligent enough to never let negative experiences or people close to my heart again.

Get a Grip.,"I feel like you guys are forgetting that we live in a capitalist society or something. If you want things, you have to pay for them, and if you're saying there's not enough content in this expansion to justify the price of a big mac at mcdonalds, then you're just being a textbook case of an entitled gamer.

Game developers don't work for free, you people claim you want developers to be well paid and for corporations to not ramp the prices of things up. Guess what, the way you get that is by paying for fairly priced DLCs when they're fairly priced, else corporate comes along and ramps the price up. 

We're already in a worse situation than CK2, where DLCs would be split into individual content packs you could pick and choose, because idiots whinged about there being too much small DLC, so now instead of the choice of 3 packs that cost $2 and a gameplay pack that costs $5, we now have one DLC that costs $15. 

If an actually terrible DLC ever comes out for CK3, nobody at paradox is going to take any of you seriously, because you piss your pants and cry every time a new DLC comes out regardless of its content, because they had the audacity to ask for payment in exchange for goods and services, like that's some kind of alien concept to you.
