So, coffees may be anywhere from $50-$1,500.

New transmissions anywhere from $9,000-$90,000. 

Getting your house cleaned, depending on the size, could be anywhere from $5,000-$50,000. 

And a two bedroom condo could run you up to $10,000,000.

1i4defp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Transduality/comments/1i4defp/introduction_to_transduality/,Introduction to Transduality,"Hi all! I‚Äôm Odd. Odd Ness, even. When I introduce myself with my first name to native English speakers, I am often met with a certain incredulity. When I follow up with my family name, hilarity usually ensues.

In my native language of Norwegian, odd doesn‚Äôt mean strange but¬†*pointed*. More specifically it points to the pointed head of an arrow. A pre-Christian myth tells of how arrowhead turned into a name due to of a man who was an avid seeker of truth. One day this man asked the Norse gods to turn him into such an arrow‚Äôs odd, and for this arrow not to stop until it hit the goal of ultimate truth. The gods promised to fulfill the man‚Äôs wish. The man was transformed into the odd of an arrow, and the gods ordered the strongest man in the village to release this arrow from his bow. According to the myth, that arrow is still roaming the skies and will forever continue to do so. Ultimate truth can never be hit, caught or seized. Its very nature is impermanence ‚Äì flux.

I hope this story didn‚Äôt leave you with vertigo. If so, here are some words of comfort, courtesy of late Tibetan Buddhist master Ch√∂gyam Trungpa: The bad news is, you‚Äôre falling through the air, nothing to hang on to, no parachute. The good news is, there is no ground.  
  
This community is dedicated to spreading the word about a concept called Transduality. Transduality claims that what‚Äôs inside of you isn‚Äôt fundamentally separate from what‚Äôs outside of you. A book on Transduality would easily risk being placed in the Mysticism section of your local library. But there really isn‚Äôt much mystical about it. There are no virgins giving birth or old men parting the Red Sea involved. None of that. It simply entails the down-to-Earth observation that separation doesn‚Äôt seem to be fundamental to life. Anyone can test the hypothesis for themselves. No tools are needed. No money. No academic degree or years of dedicated spiritual practice either. If you can read these words, that is enough.

https://preview.redd.it/qbrveg92gsde1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6609970f7a26bec89a9a24bd8d94c95dc736ed4

The whole philosophy of Transduality takes only a moment to explain, so please allow me to do so. In fact, let me use this very moment that you and I share here and now to explain it. Just notice how, looking outwards, this moment doesn‚Äôt end at the screen in front of you, or at the wall behind it. Nor at the horizon or at the border. It doesn‚Äôt end at the outer reaches of the atmosphere, and it doesn‚Äôt even end at the end of the universe, whatever that may mean. Everywhere we can and cannot go, it‚Äôs the same moment. This one.  
  
Looking inwards, notice how this moment doesn‚Äôt end at the perimeter of your skin. Nor does it end at the gate to your heart or your brain. This moment transcends and includes everything, including you and me. We are both manifestations of this infinite moment that we share here and now. Or, more poetically speaking; We are leaves on the same tree of life.  
  
And yet, since before we can speak, we are taught that we are fundamentally separate beings ‚Äì headquarters placed somewhere behind the eyes. Cut off creatures doing our best to survive in an alien world out there. The cornerstone on which the whole edifice of duality rests, that separation is fundamental, is easily dismantled. It relies only on the thought, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm fundamentally separate from what‚Äôs outside of me.‚Äô This thought has nothing to back it up. Neither logic, the sciences, or any other quarter gives any credence to this notion.  
  
The challenge is this: We live in a world or matrix that is built on this assumption. The platform we all stand on rests upon it. Even if we try to step out into the unknown we will sooner or later gravitate back to the matrix of duality, since there isn‚Äôt yet another platform to stand on.  
  
During the recent pandemic I felt impressed by friends on SoMe using their spare time to learn new skills. This woman in particular served as an inspiration:

I‚Äôm not really a coffee drinker though, so I decided to have a go at making sushi instead, as I positively love the stuff. Here‚Äôs how that went:  


https://preview.redd.it/m8yt658mgsde1.jpg?width=280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=110466c006ccf3635382529003551f30ed1f276f

After this setback my spirits were again lifted when I read that Newton had spent quarantine during the great plague of 1665 inventing calculus, formulating a theory of universal gravitation, and doing groundbreaking work on the nature of light. I ended up doing the very same thing during covid! Well. except for the calculus, gravity and light bits. Here‚Äôs an actual snapshot of what I did bring back to the world after my own quarantine:

https://preview.redd.it/pmaky3ztgsde1.jpg?width=438&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e86e57a5aac6e0a6534a114854e1686175c4c23

That picture doesn‚Äôt tell the full truth. I did actually invent a three-pronged cellular cure for the duality disease during the pandemic: the Single, Double, and Poly Cells of Transduality. Together these Cells will create a new matrix, a new platform to stand on. Am I comparing myself to the great man himself? Why, of course not. I have much better hair, and my finely tuned sixth sense would never allow falling fruit to ruffle my mop.

If, to paraphrase the Wu-Tang Clan, duality rules everything around me, does talking about Transduality turn me into this guy?

But mostly, not even that. I‚Äôve spoken to tons of people about Transduality, and I have yet to meet anyone who doesn‚Äôt resonate with its ideas. No one really believes in the gospel of duality anymore. We have all seen how it produces conflict, lack of connection, and environmental destruction. And we have all experienced glitches in the matrix of duality, what I call NLEs (Near-Life Experiences), where the unbearable heaviness of being is replaced by lightness.

Maybe in a house of worship. While meditating, doing yoga or breathing exercises, or taking a Wim Hof style ice bath. Or dancing your ass off at a rave where God is a DJ. Maybe on attending or participating in a sports event. While watching the Super Bowl, catching a wave, trekking in beautiful nature, or participating in a game of wine volleyball. Or at a concert, playing in a band, singing in a choir, or banging away in a drum circle. Maybe after a particularly satisfying day at work. While having a heart to heart with a trusted friend. Or living those magical first six months of love. Making love. Tripping on psychoactive drugs‚Ä¶

https://preview.redd.it/m8v7ovibksde1.jpg?width=454&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9395a62ca22e43897d162a23d21ea562899ca5b2

But the high always ends. Back to life, back to duality. Such experiences of lightness and connection come from having the weight of the world off our shoulders, if only for a short while. When we mistake the line between us on the inside and everything else on the outside to be fundamental, that‚Äôs what we get. The weight of the world placed firmly on top of us. No amount of dedication, meditation or medication will change this fact. A fundamentally separate self sinks like a stone when chucked into the deep waters of reality. We must flog that dead horse to keep it afloat, rendering life into the slide of an unprotected knee over a never-ending gym floor. The fluid flow of life morphed into science friction.  
  
So, we‚Äôve seen through the limitations of the duality OS. Transduality offers a clear upgrade, a smoother OS that isn‚Äôt at constant loggerheads with the reality we‚Äôre trying to navigate. But how do we get there from here?  
  
Great Integral philosopher Ken Wilber claimed that the German Idealists were the modern Western philosophers who came closest to the conclusions reached by the most interesting Eastern traditions ‚Äì conclusions I would call transdual. The problem, according to Wilber, was that the Idealists lacked a yoga, vessels other people could sail to reach the shores of those conclusions themselves. The cells of Transduality are designed to be such vessels, and you are hereby invited to climb onboard your own vessel and sail to the other shore.

I'm looking for some advice on the best way to approach a neighbour, or whether it's even advisable to try...

  
I moved to Manchester (and loving it so far!); For 6+ months I've had no issues whatsoever however since Christmas I believe I have had new neighbours move in above me as there is a regular sound of furniture being dragged throughout the day (I suspect heavy chairs perhaps if they work from home?).

  
I mostly WFH so whilst it's not going to destroy me to have a little noise, it can be a little irritating at times.

  
I'm in two minds whether to attempt to raise it with them (kindly!) as they may just not have had a chance to buy furniture protectors yet or may not be aware of the noise that they're creating, or alternatively just adopt a 'live and let live' mentality and deal with being a smidge disgruntled.

  
I absolutely don't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable so I don't want to even approach the idea of passive aggressive notes etc, I was thinking of knocking one evening to welcome them to the building, give them a bottle of wine and mention that their chairs sometimes make noise and offer them some of my extra furniture/floor protector pads (felt pads that go on the bottom of furniture legs etc). I definitely don't want to make any enemies as i know i could have MUCH worse noise from them - if anything I'd even be open to the idea of getting to know them. Since moving in I've gotten to know the neighbours on my floor very well and we've become a little friendship group (about 10+ of us), I've hosted some socials for them, we've gone for coffee walks / dinners / shopping trips together so I'd be happy to loop them in too!

  
I'm just looking for some advise on whether or not i should attempt to raise the noise with them (and if so...what would be the best and friendliest way to do this?) or do i just keep my mouth shut and have a little grumble to myself every once in a while when its noisy?

For my current fast, I started at 9:30 PM on Sunday, January 5th, weighing 242 lbs. As of this morning, January 18th, I‚Äôm down to 216.9 lbs. My original goal was to hit 220 lbs, but I also wanted to know I could push myself to complete a 14-day fast as a mental challenge. Even though I‚Äôve surpassed the weight goal, I‚Äôm sticking with it. I‚Äôll hit the 14-day mark tomorrow (Sunday) at 9:30 PM but plan to extend the fast just a little further by breaking it Monday afternoon with some beef bone broth to ease my digestive system back.

For context: I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2, 54 years old, workout most days, and my Garmin watch calculates my VO2Max at 44. Based on past DEXA scans, I am probably at around 15% body fat at this point. Staying active is important to me, even during fasting periods.

Here‚Äôs my simple fasting ""diet"":

* **LMNT zero-calorie electrolyte supplement** (2‚Äì3 times/day)
* **Water** (still and fizzy)
* **Black tea/Americano**
* **Chamomile tea**

And that‚Äôs it. No other calories because I prioritize autophagy and want to maximize the benefits.

Quick side note: I use Garmin‚Äôs scale, which syncs my weight data to the cloud effortlessly. But its body fat, skeletal muscle, and bone mass calculations? Let‚Äôs just say... they‚Äôre awful. Feels like Garmin isn‚Äôt even trying in that department.

Sharing this, including some details, to hopefully motivate others to give multi-day fasting a try if they are interested in turbo-charging autophagy, reducing inflammation, burning fat, and generally challenging themselves.

Holler if you have any questions. I am just a guy and certainly not a pro, but I've worked out my whole life, work a normal 9-5, and know my body and what works for me, well.",3,1737223294.0,fasting,2,1.0,False

1i4d8ay,https://www.reddit.com/r/NHLHUT/comments/1i4d8ay/how_to_have_fun_in_this_game_since_a_lot_of_the/,How to have fun in this game (since a lot of the playerbase seems unaware),"Step 1: build the outdoor arena. Seriously. The amount of joy peak has brought me is well worth the 300kish i spent. And man does the generic junior league arena seem drab and dull now. Plus the graphics are way better outside for whatever reason. If we all have them it'll make for a much more fresh, and visually appealing time online. 

Step 2: play with who you want. Theme teams are a lot of fun. Stop chasing every big card. Especially when all you do is force one Ts, cross creases, and glitch goal on the goal line short side. Your extra 3 ovr isn't helping that much. Maybe if you actually enjoyed your team and aren't grinding every chase card or spending all your money on a team, you wouldn't even feel the need to sweat so hard. Which brings me to...

Step 3: for the love of god, stop spamming glitch goals and play hockey. If the game is such a chore to you you feel the need to just spam the same moves over and over to get things done faster and easier,  maybe it's not the game for you. Yes it's annoying to play against but for your own happiness, why? You cannot possibly be having fun lol

Step 4: etiquette. I, personally, am a mirror when it comes to online play. As are many in the player base, as proven by the many GOOD games, played with utter class that I've enjoyed over the years. The joy i get from these rare games is what is driving me to create this post. A light in the dark. I often will gift goals to people when they lose with class. 

Just today i had a CHAMPS game where the person waited for me when i was afk. So when they took a weak penalty i didnt use it. When that caused a 4 on 4 from ragging we went at it til the 20 sec i was on pk and they did the same for me and waited it out in their zone. Neither of us took any icings or over crowded the net. No one spammed any one thing, nice variety. No replays were played. It was glorious even tho i lost. We played hockey and the better play won them the game. 

The opposite side of the spectrum is darkness. A toxicity that can only be explained by deeply unhappy people being on the other end.

If you purposely suck* the fun out of online play, why? The only people you actually get the reaction you want out of are noobs. I will either quit (rare), find a way to have fun despite the loser (many times winning anyways), or waste your time back while playing a mobile game, catching up on the news, or scrolling reddit. All while calmly listening to cool jazz, sipping coffee, and blazing top notch chronic. After all,  that being your life is punishment enough. It's sad really. That people need that. That they are so starved of positivity. So warped by false ego. I hope you get therapy or find some other way to find happiness. This is not the behavior of a well adjusted human being. 

It takes no skill to practice fh bh combos over and over and mcdavid in for breakaways all game. It is ridiculous to waste time playing the replays of glitch goals, show some decency. The michigan still? Seriously? And the childish messages, jfc get a life. Do anger management. Meditate. Stop it. Change your life cuz somethin ant workin.

And if you don't, i hope you dont mind your own medicine. Because i will drown you in it. I couldn't give af less about an L on my record.

And non toxics: turn off messages from strangers. It's a breath of silent fresh air. And mic communication with randos so toxics can't hop on the mic and effect your mood that way. Don't feed the trolls. 

Step 5: creating your own audio settings combined with playing your own music is a game changer. Change to your preferences but personally i turn off all sounds except the game sfx. The amount of focus and how much better the vibes are is remarkable. 

For music i recommend instrumental stuff:

Cool jazz: bill evans is a good place to start
Relaxing classical or opera both if these are nice for morning sessions. 
Instrumental rock: distant Dream, city of the lost, if the trees could talk,  etc
Trancy: emancipator, sol rising, shpongle, ozric tentacles
Instrumental metal: animals as leaders, chainsaw for birthday 

For more recs comment with some direction on what you like and id be hapoy to geek out on it with ya.

Step 6: stop grinding to near insanity. Afk when applicable. These sb and moments challenges are easily cheesable. Pop on 2 min rookie sb, afk first two periods, thru legs faceoff to cross crease goals to get ahead, then pop next faceoff to biggest dman and retreat to your own zone. Wait for the other team's defenseman to approach then spin till they are stuck behind you.

Find an OT moment to spam for moment cheesing if your out of moments w good rewards to do.

Dont chase losses or continue to play when your are frustrated. I play my best when my life has variety. When i get real work done and exercise. Don't play online on an empty stomach or when sleepy. 

Step 7: (optional) for you adventurous types: a nice coffee with some oat milk and a high grade sativa do wonders for all gaming. I recommend lavazza italian coffee and an indoor sativa dominant hybrid from you local dispenser

I unfortunately really don‚Äôt like coffee or tea‚Äî coffee actually just the smell grosses me out.  Can‚Äôt have anything with coffee flavor etc. so when I need a boost I‚Äôm usually hitting a zero sugar monster energy or redbull.  Realizing that is horrible, I tried switching to just water with a caffeine + L-theanine capsule (200mg of each).  

I get mega bored with water all the time though even with a twist of lemon or lime etc. so I‚Äôve been making this drink and like it quite a bit.  In my shaker bottle:

-12-16oz nut milk
-About a tablespoon of quality cacao (been using Bryan Johnson‚Äôs blueprint brand)
-Approx 2 tsp of celyon cinnamon 
-Approx 1 tablespoon collagen peptides
-Approx 1 tablespoon black chia seeds
-Take the caffeine w/L-Theanine supplement

It‚Äôs pretty damn good. Seems like it would be healthy?  At least healthier I suspect than the energy drinks.  

I don‚Äôt know much about nutrition or if mixing any of the things I mentioned above together would be a bad idea.  It‚Äôs been nice having something with some flavor.

The popularity of Pit Bulls and why this is so problematic:

I am sure that this post will garner a fair amount of negative response, but at this point I am more afraid of the consequences of not speaking out than I am of the anger that may come my way for daring to say what so many of my colleagues feel, but keep silent about for fear of censure.

The reality is that almost daily we get requests for help from people who have either bought or adopted Pit Bulls and Pit Bull mixes and are reaching out due to the following:
1. They have more than one dog of this type and they are now fighting and doing serious damage to each other.
2. They have one of these dogs that has done serious damage to another dog in the family.
3. They have had to separate their dogs due to fighting, but now want them back together.
4. They can no longer walk their dog, because it has done damage to another dog on walks.
5. They have adopted a dog of this type and want the dog ‚Äúsocialised‚Äù as it shows reactivity to other dogs.

We have dealt with so many of these cases that it has gotten to a point where we are wanting to simply refuse to get involved anymore, because these situations are far too predictable and can seldom be resolved to the satisfaction people are hoping for. Something needs to change and if those of us who deal with this on a daily basis are not willing to speak up, it is unlikely that they will and we will be responsible for people making the same mistakes over and over again.

I am not sure where the idea has come from that Pit Bulls and Pit Bull mixes are such great companion animals and the most idealised family dogs. Were they popularised by the Dog Whisperer and his awful TV show? Is it simply that there are so many of them spilling out from communities where they are still used for fighting and as a status symbol, that they now comprise the majority of dogs in shelters and so rescue organisations have done a massive PR campaign in order to get them adopted? Or is it that they have become a good way for people to feel they are championing an ‚Äúunderdog‚Äù and fighting against prejudice, because people mistakenly equate the reality of breed predisposition with racial prejudice and bigotry? 

Perhaps it is a combination of all of these things, but I am constantly dismayed by extremely kind, loving and well-meaning people such as:
‚Ä¢ The young, active person who wants a pit bull as a partner for recreation and expects the dog to run free on the mountain and beaches, visit coffee shops and attend social functions at friends‚Äô homes
‚Ä¢ The young couple wanting to get their first dog before they start a human family who been told that pit bulls are wonderful with kids
‚Ä¢ The person who falls in love with the idea of rescuing an ‚Äúunderdog‚Äù with a difficult past 
‚Ä¢ The young family who goes to adopt a puppy, and are told that breed does not matter 
‚Ä¢ The person with the big heart who keeps adding more and more dogs to their home, believing that they will all get on, regardless of type and history, if they are simply given enough love
‚Ä¢ The caring husband and father who believes that a pit bull will keep his family safe from intruders and be a great companion for the kids

While no one disputes the idea that herding breeds are predisposed to herd, guarding breeds are predisposed to guard, pointers tend to point, retrievers like to hold things in their mouths and terriers like to hunt small critters, for some reason most people do not seem able to accept the fact that dogs that have been selectively bred to fight and kill each other might just be good at doing just that and MORE EASILY drawn into that type of behaviour pattern than another type of dog. This does not mean that these dogs are ‚Äúevil‚Äù, it does not mean that there are absolutely no exceptions, it does not mean that no other type of dog is capable of doing harm to other dogs and it does not mean that a well-managed dog of this type may not make a loving companion for someone who accepts the risks and learns to mitigate them. However, it does mean that for the average person, acquiring a dog of this type is bringing a dog into their home that presents a HIGHER risk than many other types of dogs they could have chosen. 

What is most concerning is that the majority of the people who end up in these situations do not intentionally choose this increased risk: they are often kind-hearted people who simply have no idea that the risk exists, because they have been told fairy tales by rescue organisations, believed some nonsense they have seen on TV or had no reason to doubt the ‚Äúit‚Äôs all how you raise them‚Äù mantra. This is so grossly unfair and my heart breaks when we have to be the ones to tell caring people hard truths such as that their dogs may never be able to live freely together again, that their dogs fighting poses an enormous risk to their young children and the dogs may need to be rehomed or that they cannot ever let their dog off lead in public or allow it to interact with other dogs again. 

Few people want to hear these things or live like that. Few people would ever deliberately choose this reality for themselves, their dogs and their families. Yes, I do realise that there are never any 100% guarantees when getting any dog of any type from any source at any age, BUT are we really going to deny that there are not factors that increase the risk of having a dog with dog-dog aggression? Why would we lie to ourselves and to others? Who are we trying to protect by going along with this ‚Äì or are we just protecting ourselves from an unpopular and uncomfortable truth?

Is it not time to warn people that acquiring a dog that has been selectively bred for dog-dog aggression (and not defensive type aggression, but rather ‚Äúgameness‚Äù or predatory type aggression) that they are INCREASING THEIR RISK of having a dog that gets into serious fights with other dogs in the home, that does not get along with other dogs at all and that is likely to do very serious damage to other dogs and any humans that happen to get in the way if they do get into a fight? If we kindly warn people and they choose the risk, that is their responsibility, but if we remain silent and they make a choice not knowing the risk, then surely we are partly responsible for the problems they may end up facing. I for one, do not want to bear that responsibility anymore, so I am speaking out motivated by compassion, not judgement  - I hope this post will be received in this way.",13,1737222264.0,BanPitBulls,4,1.0,False

Now I‚Äôm having coffee and chatting with my friend about doing dollar store crazy‚Äôs. Today I am meeting with M and E to do an art day which is very exciting. I think I‚Äôm going to bring my sketchbook and the dinosaur donut. Poor thing. Everyone makes so much fun of it for looking like a bhole. She needs to be finished ASAP. 

Things are fine. I‚Äôm fine-ish. 

Found a weed store within walking distance of my apartment and next to it is a vape shop so that‚Äôs cool. 

I set up most of my office yesterday. I bought a power tool and hung some shit. I feel pretty unstoppable with my pink drill. My office set up was kind of a quandary because I just had a lot of weird furniture. A desk. A chest. A small bookshelf. And an easel. I was a little challenged by making an arrangement that made sense. My old rainbow carpet is basically brown now but I decided to keep it for painting days. Why buy a new carpet if there is a chance it will get paint on it?

My friend seems to be doing better and I am not as worried about her now. Things were getting dark and I was scared. But she seems alright. 

Mister and I have had a few weird moments. Yesterday, I was looking at nonalcoholic mocktails and he said he didn‚Äôt like that. I asked why. He said it seems like a slippery slope. I asked what the difference between a mocktail and a cbd drink is. I asked what the difference between a mocktail and the copious amounts of weed I consume is. I asked what the difference between any of the shit I do to keep myself sane and a mocktail is. And then I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to drink. I don‚Äôt. Like at all. But I do want to find ways to relax and this is part of that‚Äù. 
He acquiesced. It felt kind of weird for the rest of the night though we tried hard to not be weird. 

I don‚Äôt like being challenged and I know this is a serious character flaw but I also don‚Äôt like it because I have thought about it. I think about everything hardcore. (Except maybe amazon purchases lol). He does this thing where I make a decision or talk about a decision I am about to make and then he cuts me off before I have shared the entirety of the idea to tell me that it‚Äôs wrong or there are flaws. It upsets me so much. 
I asked that he trust my decision making skills. That he allow me to make executive decisions because I am smart and I am thoughtful and I have our community‚Äôs best at the forefront of my mind at all times. He said he would work on it. I know some habits are hard to shed. 

I have been feeling resentful about a lot of stuff. The move. The cleaning. The cats. His lack of participation in the relationship. I am under enormous pressure and I feel he does not have the capacity to be supportive. 

When I think about having sex‚Ä¶. Well‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt. 
I can‚Äôt even address that right now. I don‚Äôt want it. I know he wants it but I when I have tried to address our issues it‚Äôs always ‚ÄúI dunno‚Äù, ‚ÄúI dunno‚Äù. I‚Äôm tired of it. He‚Äôs like Jon snow all of a sudden. Doesn‚Äôt know. Doesn‚Äôt want it. 

Anyway. I have a lot to do. I let myself go and I need to get my face and hair back together since my body is a wreck. Going to dye my hair. Do makeup.

**Midnight**  
**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Western Agricultural Annexia, Burley Farm**

Eamon Burley was gripped by a cold, clammy fear he felt in his antlers, from the velvet down to the quick. He‚Äôd laughed at the rumors of the hexfire, the witch lights that danced in the night sky. Foolish tales of the wildmen, repeated by drunks and gossips, believed by children and halfwits.

‚ÄòFoolish tales‚Äô that were now casting rays of cold blue light through the shutters of his farmhouse.

To make it all the more eerie, there were no tell-tale ripples in the mana currents, as if the mysterious light was made with neither magic nor alchemy. But what mundane flame burned an icy blue? What mortal arts could call down what sounded like a small tempest raging outside? What unnatural horror had seen fit to blight his farm that night?

Eamon shook himself. What a sight he must look, cowering in his sitting room like a child while some mad bastards tramp about his fields as they please, waving magic torches about. Hexfire? Bollocks to that! The nature of the cheat might not be known to him, but it was a cheat all the same. Just a load of bloody tricksters getting their jollies spreading havoc. Well, all the pity for them, for choosing to make havoc on Eamon Burley!¬†

Rising to his hooves, he scooped up his quill caster and some spare quiver-boxes. The rickety weapon had seen better days, now relegated to killing vermin and shooing away larger pests. Still, Eamon reckoned a backside full of barbed quills would put a stop to this mayhem. He turned the spigot on the mana ampoule to full power, safety be damned. Steeling himself, Eamon marched out onto his front porch.

Total bedlam greeted him outside, winds whipping at his face, great clouds of chaff and dirt blocking his sight and stuffing his nose. And the light, that terrible blue light, piercing like a tyrant‚Äôs glare! With all that mayhem happening, it was hard to tell where the menace was located. He could make out a shimmering‚Ä¶ something, looming over the fields, moving to and fro like some great big honeybee. Blinking away the light and dust, Eamon tried tracking the thing by looking at the shifting pearl grain, as one would seek a fish from ripples on the water.

His grip tightened on the quill-caster, the warped wood and pitted metal reassuringly solid in his hands. Finding his legs again, he cleared the porch, breaking into a dash toward the fields. He stopped just outside the fields proper and bellowed a challenge. ‚ÄúPlay all the tricks you want, but I‚Äôm not running, you shower of bastards! So clear off, or come get what‚Äôs coming to you!‚Äù

The quaver in his voice betrayed a small measure of remaining fear, but he‚Äôd already committed to his threat. Straining to aim at his barely visible foe, Eamon opened fire, the mechanism of the quill caster clicking loudly as it sent quills whistling into the chaos with magically enhanced speed. The sound of metal on metal followed, nails spilled on an anvil. Slowly, the ghostly lights shifted, baleful rays converging on him until the glare made his eyes water.¬†

Eamon hurriedly jammed another quiver-box into the caster‚Äôs hopper, nearly dropping it in his haste. He let loose another volley, spraying quills every which way. Another staccato of metal striking metal, and still the blue lights did not relent. Suddenly, they bobbed up and down, then began to bear down on him. Eamon let out an undignified shriek, firing the remaining quills before falling squarely on his rump.¬†

The light washed over him, blotting out all else from his vision, before receding. The tempest winds likewise dissipated, leaving Eamon staring up at the night sky, the air still once again. Against all common sense, his lackluster showing seemed to have warded off the intruder. It took a few heartbeats for Eamon to realize his dubious victory, at which point he held his fist aloft and whooped triumphantly. ‚ÄúHuzzah! That‚Äôs right, you lot had better run!‚Äù he cried out.  
‚ÄúEamon? Eamon! What foolery is this? Running full tilt into the dark without so much as a torch!‚Äù shouted Mrs. Burley from the porch, blazing lantern in hand. The phantom‚Äôs departure had left Eamon standing in dim moonlight, blind as a bat. Mrs. Burley trudged over to her-still shaking husband to bring him some much-needed light.  
‚ÄúDamn it woman, you were hollering at me to do summat, so I DID summat!‚Äù shot back Eamon.¬†

The pair continued bickering on how much ‚Äòsummat‚Äô Eamon had truly accomplished as they made their way deeper into the fields where the lights had touched down. The Burleys swept the lantern light across the crops, the scowls on their faces deepening as they took in the damage done to their fields. Swathes of the pearl grain had been flattened, circular shapes and great arcing paths that traced strange patterns in the vandalized fields.  
‚ÄúEamon, you get the Sheriff here first thing tomorrow, you hear me?‚Äù  
‚ÄúNo need to tell me twice, pet.‚Äù

**Midnight**  
**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Lodestone Hills, Splitskull Mine**

Splitskull took its expansion efforts seriously, as the mineral resources they extracted made them a major player in the Frontier Territories, earning both physical and political coin from their Nexian benefactors. New claims were guarded jealously, with thieves and claim jumpers being met with lethal force. The instruments of said lethal force were now being roused from a late night nap.¬†  
‚ÄúForeman! Foreman! Someone‚Äôs been scratching around the new claim! I seen it!‚Äù  
‚ÄúQuit your yammering and show me proof, you lackwit. Got better things t‚Äôdo than chase after your damned ghosts.‚Äù  
‚ÄúLookit there, see them ruts? And there, bore holes like them magick men use for dowsing!‚Äù  
‚ÄúStone strike me dead, you picked a fine time to be right‚Ä¶ Get that alarum up, I‚Äôll be damned if anyone poaches this claim! You, send for the tremorsenses! We‚Äôll hunt down this greedy hog and gut them!‚Äù  
‚ÄúYou heard the foreman! Get moving or the Hag will have your hides!‚Äù

The Hag of Splitskull was a tough old crone, a daughter of House Cormyn through and through. She was a harsh mistress, but fairer than most patrons. Still, Lady Gladys Cormyn was running a mining operation, not an alms house. Any losses incurred meant money out of their purses. With their daily bread threatened, the workmen‚Äôs fury burned bright like the cold fire of the stars. They descended on the claim site, picks and hammers in hand. Workers wielding tremorsenses moved ahead of them as guides, following the sound map of the terrain beneath their feet.

The fresh gouges and furrows were easily picked out by the tremorsenses, though they made little sense. Thin, long boreholes, no wider than a man‚Äôs fist, much like the first cuts prospectors would make when seeking seams of ore. What kind of fool would riddle an already marked claim with sampling cuts? The reason didn‚Äôt matter. Whatever they wished to know, they‚Äôd beat it out of the interloper‚Äôs skull soon enough.

A deep rumbling shook the workers out of their frenzy. The guides cried out, their lanterns and pointing fingers all aimed at a single location nearby. Alchemical flares were activated and lobbed, lighting up the scene in an orange-yellow light. It also revealed a sight the miners had wished they hadn‚Äôt uncovered. The tremorsenses rattled in their slackening grips as the dark shape heaved itself out of the earth.¬†

The terrible din that erupted out of thin air had an immediate effect on the miners, making their ears ring and stomachs turn as they reeled from the sonic assault. The world began to tumble around them as their legs turned to water. ‚ÄúRun for your lives, ye daft bastards! The Deathwyrm‚Äôs screams are upon us! Flee, or yer souls are forfeit!‚Äù yelled one of the miners, only adding to the fear and confusion. But the ear-piercing cries were only the beginning of the miners‚Äô woes.

To their horror, the ground began to ripple and shift, as if a multitude of burrowing beasts were gathering beneath their feet. A heartbeat later, black serpents erupted from the churned soil, slithering toward the still emerging creature. Even as the monster‚Äôs horrid young swarmed all over it, it continued to wail as it uprooted itself from its burrow, kicking up more dust and dirt. Another miner‚Äôs raving joined the din as he screamed, ‚ÄúTis no Deathwyrm, fools! The Deep Mother has come! Her Thousand Spawn suckle at her venomous teats!‚Äù

A great black hulk with spindly insect legs erupted from the ground, its dull carapace covered in the writhing multitude of its chittering young. Eyes aglow with cold blue fire, it let out another keening cry that rattled the miners‚Äô skulls. Gusts of wind threw up great clouds of dust, obscuring all of the creature save for the witch-light cast by its eyes. For those who could still bear to look upon the scene, they saw the lights ascend into the night sky with unnatural speed.

The aftermath of the incident was equally chaotic. The assembled miners were equal parts shaken, angered, and confused. There were mutterings of strange, fanciful things. Fool-headed wildman nonsense about witch lights and earth spirits taking back what was theirs. It did not take long for talk of quitting the claim to begin making the rounds as the grumbling and arguing reached a fever pitch.  
‚ÄùENOUGH!‚Äù roared the Hag of Splitskull, stamping her hoof. Her steel shoe threw sparks as it struck the stony ground. Gladys Cormyn had little patience for foolishness. Her gravelly voice continued, ‚ÄúCool your heads, or I‚Äôll crack ‚Äòem myself! Take inventory of the losses, then leave the area be. Take some watchmen and cordon off the area until the constabulary can get a proper look at it.‚Äù¬†  
Gladys‚Äô brow furrowed. ‚ÄúSpeaking of, send a runner down with a message to the Sheriff, have him send someone over sharpish. I don‚Äôt care how late it is, the sooner I can make this a pain in Mueller‚Äôs rump instead of mine, the better.‚Äù

**Midnight**  
**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Blackbriar Forest, Giant‚Äôs Crown**

The stewards of the sacred grove converged on the interloper with righteous fury. Whether the intruder was moved by malice or madness, they did not care. Retribution would be swift and fierce. From what they had seen, the creature had descended from a great height, like some mountain raptor. But there was no predatory grace in this defiler‚Äôs actions. Splintered branches were strewn about, scattered by a blundering giant leaving a ragged tunnel through the treetops. A jagged path that led to the grove surrounding the druidic circle of Giant‚Äôs Crown.

The defenders arrived to find the grove already defaced, and the intruder appearing ready to take flight once more. It was a huge insect, a coal black beetle of titanic size, here to devour and defile. More surprising than its bulk however, was that it cast no ripples in the Weave of the land‚Äôs magic. Even golems and constructs, the soulless poppets of the Nexians, at least left some trace in the Weave. What manner of beast or artifice was this, to be utterly invisible to magic?

Shock and confusion delayed their advance for a few heartbeats, but soon they set upon the alien creature with spell, sling, and bow. The arrows and bullets bounced off it with a rattling noise, like hailstones on tin eaves. Similarly, spellflame dispersed and faded away, as a river flows around a stone. The mysterious not-beast turned lazily, as if unimpressed by the protectors‚Äô opening play. Then it countered with its own fiendish arts, beginning with an almighty flash that blotted out the world with searing white light.

There was a barbarous simplicity to the technique used. The illusory projection conjured forth was barely coherent, lacking any color, and taking on a vaguely defined shape. It was more like a collection of many motes of light rather than a proper illusion. Yet the staggering magnitude of the sensory assault was overwhelming, each mote burning with eye-searing intensity and scattering any mana stream that it intersected. Rather than relying on sophistication to fool the senses, the conjurer instead chose to bludgeon them into submission.

By the time the grove‚Äôs guardians had recovered, the interloper had long taken flight, leaving them to gawk at the despoiled grove in confusion and outrage. One of the druids steadied herself against her staff. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I do not understand,‚Äù she said in a daze. ‚ÄúIn reaching out to seize it, my magic found no purchase.‚Äù  
‚ÄúThe same misfortune befell me, sister. I saw no Weave around it, only black steel. But when I called forth the lodestone‚Äôs might, it caught nothing.‚Äù  
‚ÄúThis is an ill portent. We crossed paths with the Sky Stalker, out on a grim hunt for its masters,‚Äù muttered an older druid. He referred to the hunting sled of the Night Lord, a living construct said to be made of black steel forged in the cold fire of the stars, in the hellish realm of endless night above.  
‚ÄúDo not tempt fate by saying such things!‚Äù  
‚ÄúWhat else would it be then? Perhaps I have mistaken it for some OTHER golem of black steel, with eyes of starfire? You yourself felt that the Weave of the land could find no purchase on it!‚Äù

A serene voice cut through the simmering argument. ‚ÄúSteady yourselves, arguing in a time of crisis is fruitless,‚Äù spoke the Elder. The assembled woodsmen and druids grew silent in deference, allowing him to continue, ‚ÄúFocus on what can be done. Ardath, what wounds has the interloper left in its wake?‚Äù  
‚ÄúThe boughs have been shorn as if harvest time had come,‚Äù replied the huntmaster. ‚ÄúFruit and leaf, bark and flower, cut with a keen edge and steady hand,‚Äù he elaborated, pointing to the cleanly sheared boughs of the sacred trees. ‚ÄúBut guided by hungry eyes and an addled mind,‚Äù he continued, pointing out a great swathe of denuded trees with a sweep of his hand.  
‚ÄúMarred as if set upon by a horde of poachers, yet no spell-sign or other clue as to the culprit‚Äôs nature. Most distressing,‚Äù concluded the Elder.¬†  
The group nodded in agreement, and the Elder continued, ‚ÄúArdath, I would have you visit with our brethren who treat with the Meadowfolk, to give warning.‚Äù  
The huntmaster bristled at the Elder‚Äôs request. ‚ÄúRannik and Elwin? What need is there to involve those city-head fool‚Äì‚Äù  
‚ÄúStay your ire,‚Äù intoned the Elder calmly, suppressing dissent with the lightest of gestures. ‚ÄúThough we oft disagree in matters petty, the Meadowfolk remain our kin, despite the labors of the elves to make them forget. All the troubles of this land are shared between us. You will visit with Rannik and Elwin to tell them in full of what we have found here, so that the men of law may be forewarned. We will hear young Reynard‚Äôs judgment with interest.‚Äù

**Midnight**  
**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Order of the Distant Star, Rooftop**

Each of the monks assembled on the Order of the Distant Star‚Äôs rooftop felt unease penetrate their being. They were a mixed group of Caedwynians and various outrealmers, but they all felt distress rising within them. A lump in their throat, a pit forming in their belly, a prickling down their back. A shepherd‚Äôs bullroarer droned in the distance, a distress signal. Alchemical flares erupted from the Lodestone Hills, where the Splitskull Mine would be, while similar beacons went up over the farmlands. Dread burrowed into their hearts, deeper and deeper with each flash of the so-called ‚Äòhexfire‚Äô streaking heavensward.

‚ÄúStars guide us, there‚Äôs another one,‚Äù remarked Brother Daffyd, laboring to get a better look at the latest spark of otherworldly light. The Order had only two telescopes at their disposal, and only one of those was fitted with treated lenses and collection arrays to observe mana fields at extreme distances. Yet even with the collectors dialed to maximum sensitivity, the old monk could not perceive even the tiniest ripple in the mana fields. ‚ÄúAs always, no perceptible magic or mana flow,‚Äù he reported.  
‚ÄúHas to be something not of this world, why else would it manifest so unnaturally?‚Äù muttered Brother Adso as he wrote down Daffyd‚Äôs observations.  
‚ÄúRather strange for an otherworldly being to be so oddly focused on causing havoc out in the meadows and farms,‚Äù replied another monk, gesturing at the beacons and signs lit in the distance.  
‚ÄúThat behavior is itself highly irregular! You recall that before tonight, the manifestations were cyclical and wholly benign, do you not?‚Äù grumbled Brother Aelister.  
‚ÄúI am more concerned with this sudden shift to directly acting upon the land and people,‚Äù interjected another monk. ‚ÄúCould they herald more dire events, I wonder?‚Äù His suggestion kicked off the arguments in earnest, as all manner of theories and assumptions were thrown about.

‚ÄúCalm yourselves, my brothers!‚Äù exhorted Brother Daffyd, turning away from the telescope to face the group. ‚ÄúDebate ought to be rigorous and vigorous, as young Adso likes to jest,‚Äù he said. The monks chuckled, their unease lifting a small measure. Daffyd continued, ‚ÄúBut, it is clear that there are a great many unknowns regarding this phenomenon, thus any discussion on it would be rudderless. It is clear we must discern more of its nature.‚Äù  
‚ÄúAre you suggesting we increase our field excursions, observe directly and speak with the people?‚Äù asked Aelister excitedly.¬†  
‚ÄúCorrect, Brother Aelister. If our methodology is lacking, then we must adapt,‚Äù replied Daffyd. The monks nodded and muttered in agreement, even those who were more accustomed to the cloistered life. After all, observing the riddle that was the Universe was part of the Order‚Äôs calling. The phenomena the frontier folk were calling ‚Äòhexfire‚Äô had been yet another curiosity for them to observe and record. Yet another of the Universe‚Äôs mysteries for them to contemplate and perhaps unravel. The Order carried out their duties with diligence, closely following the pattern by which the hexfire manifested, committing all observations to record.

And that was the heart of the matter. That the enigma was recognized in the first place, that someone remembered that it happened. Solving it was a secondary concern when the threat of censure from the authorities loomed overhead. Preservation of the oddities that challenged the status quo, that was the heart of the calling to which the Order committed themselves. Because no matter how much the powers that be suppressed and obfuscated it, the [truth was out there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2d6T5G2rrY).

**00:30**  
**Greater United Nations Long Range Expeditionary Force**¬†  
**Survey Station Selene, Remote Drone Operations Center**

It was supposed to be a regular shift, keeping tabs on the sample collection process. Run diagnostics on the drones, review the logs, make sure the locals were none the wiser. The newly minted automation initiative had been running for a couple weeks now. They‚Äôd come a long way from those early days of probing space for mana emissions and mana field distortions, which turned out to be the true indicator of civilization among the stars, not radio waves or other EM signals. When the Pilot project was reeling from the loss of Pilot 1, the Pathfinder project was launching autonomous probes at whatever signs of mana-based civilization they could pick up.¬†

By the time the fresh cadet they volun-told to be Pilot 2 was walking through the portal, sending them to the supposed ‚ÄúTransgracian Academy of the Magical Arts,‚Äù the Pathfinders were taking the long way around to the edges of manaspace, limited to exploring barren rocks with remote drones. Not that there was anything wrong with barren rocks, considering they had yielded a treasure trove of mana-dampening materials that made Survey Station Selene possible in the first place.

Improved mana hardening was only the first step, however. The brass had their eye on an even bigger prize: hard intel on how magic functioned. Snooping on an inhabited planet was a risky move that they were hoping would bring them closer to their goal. It helped that the locals were none the wiser to the presence of Terran technology. Not only was manaless tech mostly invisible to their detection methods, they had no idea what to look for in the first place. Much to the higher-ups‚Äô delight, the drones were trucking along just fine, and the plan was working like a charm, as far as they could tell.

Until today‚Äôs ‚Äòsanity check‚Äô diagnostic results came back.

Based on the telemetry from the drones so far, the optimization algorithm had concluded that it sure would be swell if an entire week‚Äôs worth of collection runs could be squared away in a single night. No red flags had been thrown because as far as the program was concerned, everything was running just fine. A classic case of a logic error laying low until someone noticed too late. Every technician in Remote Operations got that sinking feeling in the pit of their stomachs, and it only grew heavier the deeper they drilled down into the issue. This was the kind of screw up that ended careers. Or entire departments, for that matter.¬†

But that was something for later down the line. Right now, priority number one was damage control. Identify and put out the biggest fires, pull back all the drones, and mitigate the damage in the aftermath. They had to make sure this disastrous glitch didn‚Äôt kill the Pathfinder project. Heading the front line defense of the Pathfinder project‚Äôs future was Senior Technician Cristian Mendez, currently wolfing down an energy bar and washing it down with sludgy, stone cold coffee.¬†  
‚ÄúSir, based on the video footage and telemetry, it looks like the drones classified the locals as wildlife and deployed countermeasures,‚Äù said a technician with a grimace.  
‚ÄúFucking hell, any injuries or casualties?‚Äù  
‚ÄúNone reported, but I‚Äôm seeing deployment of countermeasures in the logs. Noisemakers, mana chaff, flashbangs.‚Äù  
‚ÄúGreat. I‚Äôm sure HQ is gonna love knowing we‚Äôre blowing our budget on terrorizing alien hillbillies,‚Äù he grumbled. Looking up, he called out to the rest of the room, ‚ÄúAll right, damage update. Get me visuals on all sites that have had contact with the locals, followed up with sites that have been spotted after the fact. Update the heat map while you‚Äôre at it.‚Äù

A moment later, Mendez‚Äôs screen array filled with video feeds and snapshots of the affected locations, including a local farm, remote forest groves, and secluded spots in the mountains. ‚ÄúNo casualties observed. Populated areas hit are mainly farms and grazing areas. We‚Äôve got confirmed contact with the locals at one of the mining annexes, and one cultural site in the forest. And uh‚Ä¶‚Äù the technician reporting hesitated.  
‚ÄúAnd what?‚Äù prodded Mendez.  
‚ÄúThe drones have logged the collection of animal samples, but the mass recorded is too small to be an entire animal, so‚Ä¶‚Äù  
‚ÄúOf course. We got crop circles already, why not throw in some cattle mutilation to go with it?‚Äù  
‚ÄúSir?‚Äù  
‚ÄúNothing, just sci-fi stuff from ancient Earth, long before our time. UFOs making weird patterns in random wheat fields out in the boonies, stealing and carving up cattle, weird shit like that.‚Äù  
‚ÄúWho‚Äôd have thought we‚Äôd end up being the space aliens, huh sir?‚Äù replied the technician with a chuckle.  
‚ÄúTruth beats fiction again,‚Äù thought Mendez aloud. More incident sites popped up on the map, with corresponding snapshots of their aftermath.¬†

I had a weird feeling the next day & I don‚Äôt know what made me do this bc I‚Äôve never ever done this in my life but I went to my other account on Instagram & I checked his account. I found out that he hid his stories from me which is really weird because his stories were just his usual stories. I crashed out to him, I unsent the messages but the next day he told me that he could still see my texts from the notifications bar.
I feel disrespected & unappreciated because like this is literally what he said to me: ‚Äúi hid u from my stories like many other people from ur country‚Äù I don‚Äôt know how to explain it because I thought I was someone kinda special to him bc I‚Äôve literally slept in his arms & he held me really tightly all night. I just thought that I was at least a little bit more special than other people in my country. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a petty thing to get upset over but it‚Äôs just how I‚Äôm feeling.

He took a really long time to reply, I thought ‚Äúok well he hid his stories from me obviously he doesn‚Äôt want me here so I‚Äôll do him a favour & block him‚Äù and I did. I blocked him. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs noticed, I don‚Äôt think he did. I haven‚Äôt even replied to his texts. I don‚Äôt know if what I did was too much bc I did enjoy his company especially when I‚Äôm bored lol. My feelings never went away, but it was not as intense & I don‚Äôt know if I did a bad thing by blocking him or if it‚Äôs a good thing because maybe that would make me move on & hopefully meet someone better suited for me.

Been playing modern board games for close to a decade now. Life is busy and don't get nearly enough table time as I would like, but always appreciate when I can get together with friends and enjoy some games.

Here I present to you my modest collection. Only thing not pictured is Wingspan, which gets the most love by far, so it hangs out underneath the coffee table.

We have some space issues in my current house and without a dedicated game room, the games get center stage in the living room. Because of those reasons and my particular-ness, I've ended up making a bit of a game out of the organization of it all. This isn't the first iteration, but is certainly the cleanest I've gotten the color arrangement. Had a better color wheel transition between the top and bottom shelf previously, which had to be sacrificed when rotating in my latest haul from PAX Unplugged.

It's a bit of a challenge to get some games out, but I've gotten a couple techniques down that allow it without too much fuss.  Biggest issue is making room for new games. At the point I've consolidating expansions thanks to inserts and thinned out the main shelf of most undesirables, except for maybe a couple smaller ones that are space fillers; Looking at you gudetama (¬¨\_¬¨).

The winning candidate is Snr Vittorio Romeo, an acclaimed Italian gesture coach who can often be seen in the Piazza in Milan, taking his students through the finer points of using outlandish and outrageous arm waving to make a point such as 'I would like two sugars in my coffee please'. 

Snr Romeo explained; ""I have seen Mr Trump at the podium as has everyone, and although the invisible accordian and the 'Ok' subtle thumb curl were once unique and could be seen as fun, they've become tired and boring. I intend to take Mr Trump through some better and larger arm and hand gestures that have more flourish that will distract the audience from the obvious bullshit that comes out of his mouth.""

The Trump team went on to say that Snr Romeo will be allowed a H-1B visa in his tenure and that the Trump cult should just suck it up and accept they didn't make the grade to take this prestigious position. ",1,1737221865.0,onionheadlines,0,1.0,False

And I started the year making $24 and some change an hour, got my yearly raise in July and promoted to the highest level operator in late October, ending the year at $27.90. My pay scale now is from $27-36 an hour so I‚Äôm on track to climb that salary up a good bit higher. 

I have been at my current job 3 years, running CNC Swiss Lathes making surgical bone screws for a large medical device manufacturer. I was at my last job for a decade, and the closest I got to 60k was $59,750 and I worked 6 days a week, 10 hours Monday-Friday and 8 every single Saturday for the entire year. Much happier with this salary only working 3/12s on weekend shift. 

This is in South Carolina, the plant is in a more suburban area but I live in a very rural area so this is not bad, would have been pretty great about 5 years ago lol. 

This job also comes with amazing benefits. Fantastic health insurance/vision/dental, a fairly standard 401k, PTO starts at 3 weeks the first year, goes up to 4 at year 1, 5 at year 5 and up another week at every 5th year topping out at 8 weeks at 20 years. On every 5the anniversary the company pays for a vacation and gives you an extra week of PTO (not including the extra week you already get on every 5th anniversary), it‚Äôs $2500 for a vacation at year 5 and goes up another grand on every 5th anniversary. We have a free on-site medical center, a full doctors office with 1 doctor, 2 nurse practitioners and 4 nurses complete with a FREE pharmacy. We use them as our primary doctor and it costs us $0 unless there are tests that have to be sent out and then insurance is billed. On-site daycare, not free but comparable for the area and convenient. A cafeteria that serves free hot meals on every shift 7 days a week. Free coffee bar in the cafeteria. Yearly raises can be as high as 10%, with 6-7% being about average where at my last job it was 2% average and 5 was almost unheard of. The property is huge so they have a 2 mile walking path, basketball court, 4 pickleball courts, baseball field, soccer field and outdoor volleyball court all open for employee/guest use (with a signed waiver of course). And actual employee development is offered if you show the initiative, they paid me OT to come in 2 days a month for a leadership development program that will help me move into a leadership role. 

All in all I‚Äôm very glad to have made the jump, I‚Äôm not making the crazy salaries a lot of people post but for where I live and considering I went straight to working in manufacturing 1 week after I graduated high school I‚Äôm doing ok. ",2,1737221619.0,Salary,0,1.0,False

When he drinks alcohol, any amount, he's less shy and wants to be closer to me physically and emotionally.

Otherwise he's shy, distant, and unable to even sometimes look at me.
I believe it's cultural and due to trauma.

Before, we had a good conversation about boundaries, what it means to be together, how the friendship side of us is really important, etc.

We decided that having sex wouldn't impact us at all.

In the past, we hit other closeness milestone. Like making out, or kissing. Every time he felt bad. Saying he was drunk (I don't drink) and was distant for a week until I tell him to stop and reassuring him.

We had sex, and during it we decides it was fun and continue in the morning. 
Morning came and he had a headache. So I went downstairs, made coffee and food for us.

Waited for him to finish his wfh shift. Ran an errand for him.
He then went on his phone said he wasn't a good idea. That it will ruin our friendship and we shouldn't continue.

The previous night, he said he understood our boundaries and that it wouldn't ruin us but the next morning, he said it would.

He overthinks, over analyzes, and he is very anxious. Every time, I have to reassure him, make him realize his bad ideas are just anxiety. 

However this time feels different. Because sex is more than just flirting, it's more. And we were never this close and vulnerable until we were together that night.

My best friend said I should get some sunshine, but the minute I step outside I‚Äôm completely paralysed. Our conversations span miles, cities. If I walk twenty minutes to the right, I‚Äôm outside of your house. My head can‚Äôt rest on your shoulder during late night bus or train rides anymore. I‚Äôve called out of work because I hate my job, but I could always look forward to seeing you when the day was done. I guess I should go back inside. It‚Äôs funny, because if I peek out my window I can almost see your plans. The ones that you spoke of so proudly to show how good you‚Äôve got it, how you know exactly how to move on. You‚Äôve nailed the art of healing. I can almost see the bounce in your step when you pass me by. 

A lot of people say that a breakup is like someone ripping your heart out, but that feels too quick and violent. Because I felt your fingertips pushing against my ribs until they shattered like glass, and my heart was no longer cradled, it was extracted. So slowly that I could feel the sensitivity of my veins fraying, fighting desperately to stay in their place. With everything that they had. While it may not have been deliberate, you squeezed. And my pulse stopped. 

My friends are wondering if I‚Äôll come out tonight, but I can hardly stand the look of the gaping hole in my chest. ",3,1737221448.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I have more hot sauces than I could even estimate because I like this sauce with that food, that sauce with this food, this sauce on my pickles, etc. I even have different purees like shatta and ajvar for my middle eastern foods, chili oils and crunches for Asian food and hot ramens, calabrian chili sauce and Firelli's balsamic hot sauce for Italian foods, etc. With that said, I also love the taste of Louisiana hot sauce. Something about that heavy vinegar flavor. It isn't hot enough, so I usually add Da Bomb to it to spice it up. I keep a bottle next to my bed and often take a big drink of it to start my day. Works better than coffee to wake me up. And this is why my daughter thinks I'm a freak. I can't eat ANYTHING without adding heat to it. ",1,1737221409.0,spicy,3,0.67,False

And when I threw the lever on the clutch it immediately crashed.

  
And everytime I try to reload the world it instantly crashes.

I don't have a recent backup, I barely had anything when my last backup was made, I tried using Amulet editor to remove the problematic machine which worked but the editor deleted the contents of all modded inventories so I lost everything anyway.

Here is the crash log if anyone can potentially help fix this for me:

1i4cich,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1i4cich/my_thoughts_so_far_up_to_s2_e1/,My Thoughts So Far (up to S2 E1),"NOTHING BUT SPOILERS WITHIN.

ALL SPOILERS.

NO READ IF NO WANT SPOILED.


Wanted to make a post because I have no real social media presence and I have thoughts. Thoughts I'm not hearing a lot of in videos or articles about the show, so I'm curious if what I'm thinking is logical or if I am way off base.

So, off the bat, a couple times in season one the argument is made in passing that severence is bad because you are creating a whole new person that did not choose to exist. You then force that person to live a life of work and servitude.

Now, let me quickly remind you that Devon gives birth to a baby in this show.

See any connections? Having a child is.. creating a whole new person that did not choose to exist, unfortunately, into a life that will require work and servitude.

I bring it up because either it is so obvious a connection that nobody feels it is worth bringing up in any review, deep dive, theory, or video essay I've seen (I have not been on this subreddit much, though, so it is totally possible I'm saying nothing new to you), OR I'm seeing something that is there but hasn't been caught, OR I'm just making a connection that maybe isn't important.

Another thing I've seen a lot of is theories regarding Irving's painting being somehow inspired by something his innie saw. Which..

It seems pretty obvious to me that Outtie Irv is drinking coffee at night to stay up late and painting the same image over and over in order to somehow get that image to his innie. Which has.. kind of worked. Irv gets sleepy because his outtie isnt sleeping (on purpose) and dreams of paint.

To me its a very logical step to say that Outtie Irv knows about the hallway and wants Innie Irv to become curious about it. To nap and maybe dream of this thing that Outtie Irv focuses on enough to get the idea deep enough to permeate into the other side. Which again, we've seen work a bit.

Why he has a list of severed employees, I do not know, but it adds to the fact that Outtie Irv knows more than an outtie should. Perhaps he is part of the resistance, perhaps he is actually working for Lumon on both sides and the ""Get your innie to dream about something"" is a test, like forcing Mark S and Miss Casey together to make sure nothing clicks for them.

Which leads me to.. it did click.
Mark S smells Gemma's candle while sitting across from her and when asked to sculpt how he felt, he made the tree he had just visited that we can assume is where his wife died. Does he know WHY he made a tree? No. Does Cobel know what the tree represented? I submit no, but that if dhe did, she would not have given up and sent Miss Casey away. But, of course, I could be wrong and she knew the tree linked Mark to Gemma and satisfied with the success of her test, was done.

She did seem upset that there wasnt a different outcome although, and it does seem like she wants to PROVE reintegration is possible, or at least make the board aware of the dangers and find some crack in the severence procedure.

I don't know.

Finally, a season 2 spoiler, and again.. did not see anybody excitedly jump up and down and declare the major revolation for some reason.

At the very end of Season 2 Episode 1, the team is refining a file called Cold Harbor.
Then we see Gemma's face, some stats on a screen, and its all labeled.. Cold Harbor. She is Cold Harbor.

They are refining people on the testing floor. Right? Its.. right there. The boxes represent the tempers, I believe we get this information from the Lexington Files. And Kier's big accomplishment was 'taming the 4 tempers'. So I think its pretty clear that Macrodata Refinement is wiping innie'd people of Woe, Frolic, Dread, and Malice. Which.. a person with no sadness, joy, fear, or anger would make a pretty good employee/ slave/ puppet/ tool/ worshipper/ whatever.

We got a huge answer or at least a big step forward to the question ""What are they refining?"". I think. Again, not read up on this subreddit, mostly listen to reviews or deep dives or podcasts at work.

But I'm curious to know if I've caught anything new or if I'm late to the party. What do you think?",1,1737221205.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,1,0.67,False

I‚Äôm a 22 (female) who vomits for everything. Every morning. Even if I‚Äôve sleeped for more than 10, 8, or 9, hours I vomit in the mornings. 

Usually if I wake up before 8am sometimes even before 10am I‚Äôm nauseous or throwing up for a couple hours or just once for a while. 

It‚Äôs been a thing since I was a kid. Got worse during highschool and now I‚Äôm in the end of my undergraduate and it happens like every day every other day if I‚Äôm lucky! 

I‚Äôm eating fine! I don‚Äôt drink coffee stright in the morning or milk‚Ä¶usually just hot peppermint tea or green tea to calm my stomach. And I eat light foods or fruit like 2 hours after I wake up. But in between all these steps I‚Äôm throwing up a couple times! 

Stomach acid, water, stomach acid, and the food. 
All comes out. By it all I don‚Äôt eat for the majority of the day. I don‚Äôt drink at all cuz I‚Äôm on Wellbutrin! But I smoke weed once a day. 

But I‚Äôm losing weight from all the throwing up now, and I‚Äôm kind of worried.

Yesterday, I was in a coffee shop and asked for some apple cider which was poured from a typical plastic container. This has me thinking of where I might be able to source a spicier version of the commercially available apple cider.

The bathroom isn't locked anymore bc we're gearing up for potty training.

I love my son. I love my husband. I love them both so much it hurts. But I'm exhausted and every weekend I just want to drink a cup of coffee while it's still hot, while I'm not working.

I hate that my workload has been so crazy in the last few months I'm now averaging 10-11 hour days, because then I feel guilty for seldom seeing my kid during the week but as soon as the weekend hits I just want to get the hell away from him and my husband.

 I hate the guilt and shame I feel. I hate that I feel guilty for just wanting to relax on my weekend, I hate that when I try to take a break I feel awful, I hate that when I don't take breaks I get snippy, I hate that we can't afford daycare and we can't afford my husband being home full-time, I hate so many things in my life right now. 

I hate that I've become a workaholic because I would rather be working and interacting with adults and solving problems than being climbed over and needed by my son who just wants to spend time with me, I hate that my thoughts lately are ""things would be easier if he just didn't exist.""

I hate everything. I hate that I like and need my job just enough to not quit. I hate that I love my son and husband enough to not leave.

I hate that I'm not shitty enough of a manager to quit when my team needs me. I hate that I'm not shitty enough to just leave my family. I hate that I'm decent enough to put my needs on the back burner. I hate that I'm good enough to make sacrifices. I hate it.

Because I just want to be selfish. I just want to pick up and drive away. I wish I didn't marry my husband, because he deserves a wife that doesn't want these things. I wish we didn't have our kid because he deserves a mom who doesn't hide out in pantries when she just doesn't feel like building train tracks just for them to be destroyed.

It has been a stressful week and I had a feeling I needed to take my time with this one and think about it. This morning, I did that, slowly getting up, opening the plastic, then letting it sit while I made some coffee

A little later I look it over and appreciate it for what it is, the beautiful cover,  the fresh book smell, and the crisp new binding.

I think back to how my mother worked in book store when I was growing up, and I could get away with reading the books - if I left the binding crisp and it could be still be sold. That habit stayed with me for a long time. My own books getting damaged would hurt me - when I was a senior in High School my copy of Book 7 was vandalized by some other kid at school during my first read after the midnight release. Still kinda a core memory.

Starting to watch vlogbrothers shortly after that, I'd laugh at John's attitude about using books at notepads, I could never! But that guy also eats cereal with water ;)

Then there is this ex from a few years ago. They cracked the binding on my copy of a brand new book of we were reading together. I felt a little horrified at first, but it also gave me a weird ownership over that book. It has all kinds of damage and I love it lol

So I did that with this one - I gently broke in the binding, relaxing the leather and cover pages a bit; enjoying the feeling of the book in my hands, and what a smell..is it different because this is leather covered? I remember the video mentioning a ribbon book mark  but this has a pencil holder, and the thing that holds the book closed like a notebook??

Then I read the intro, and was asked to check a box. Wow, what a feeling! The next page made me realize I need an actual notepad to get my ideas out before I commit them to these pages...but maybe in real ink.

Anyway, just a rambling story about a person and their new book that they will be teaching about themselves

I've been getting into low cafs lately ‚Äî mostly Laurinas ‚Äî as they don't seem to affect me as much as regular coffee! I tried the following ones:

- A matter of concrete (A.M.O.C.) - Laurina. This is a rare coffee from Supriyanto‚Äôs farm on Mount Suket, East Java, Indonesia as it's the first-ever Indonesian-grown Laurina coffee. Only tried it as filter and really enjoyed it. This coffee is process-forward (anaerobic natural), offering a fruity and vibrant profile. It has a silky body, bright citric acidity, and a sweetness reminiscent of macadamia nuts and guava, with hints of orange and cacao nibs. 

- Kawa - Finca San Francisco (second pic). This is a Laurina from El Salvador and it was just added to Kawa's shop. Still resting this one but I couldn't resist giving it a taste. Also, anaerobic natural process but with higher acidity. I could taste green apple and lemon zest. 

- Kontext coffee - Excelsa. This was recommended by a fellow Redditor. I've never had an Excelsa before so wasn't sure what to expect. This coffee is highly processed (anaerobic, natural, yeast inoculated) and it is a genus of Liberica so it's very unusual. Not sure how I feel about it but it sure is different. Unusual type of acidity and high level of sweetness. We did a cupping with this one, a Laurina, and a few arabica coffees and this one got the most extreme reactions from people (love or hate situation!).

I‚Äôm interested in hearing how this affects people and what they do to optimize their tasting experience with respect to ambient air. 

If you‚Äôve experienced it, then you can understand how the air in your environment will affect the taste of your coffee.  Example: After brewing an Ethiopian natural and resting the cup for a few minutes, I begin to taste sweet and tangy citrus notes, but the specific note is indiscernible. Upon stepping outside to breathe fresh, cool air, a punchy burst of wild blueberry with a light hibiscus note, lingering blueberry jam sweetness. When moving back indoors, the flavors become indiscernible again. 

I posit that the difference is either in the breathe through the nose prior to sipping, or breathing in the cold air via mouth while sipping. Likely the latter.  At any rate, if you haven‚Äôt tried this, give it a go. If you are familiar with this concept, share your thoughts!",1,1737220115.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

They are not coffee aficionados or snobs, but they would like a higher-end machine (up to $2k).

I, now 35F cut off my best friend, Annie, of 17 years and didn't even bother to tell her so. Bit of context...we met in high school after I transfered from another school, I was initially very intimidated by her and her friends coz I was the new girl..introverted and had transfered from an all girl school and was bullied indirectly in all of my previous schools because we(family) didn't have money. So I was highly reserved when it came to girls as friends. Annie and I grew close within month and I had to deal with the wrath of her original best friend but I still did make my own best friend. It was until the last 2 months of high school that Annie and I were officially besties, with sleepovers and long calls and so on. Side note, my original best friend was no longer my best friend because she snuck off to another friends house with boyfriend (we were on a break! So I could focus on finals) anywhooo, they both were cut off and highly embarrassed infront of our whole senior class! By yours truly! Another story, another day. 

Over the 17 years, Annie was a social butterfly and I was the introverted, stay at home friend. She would always be invited to all family functions, including my brothers weddings, parents anniversary dinners and just always welcome for sleepovers or just a visit and no invitation needed for a catch up session. Mind you, i was not allowed to frequent her hang outs because of my dads job, which i grew so accustomed to that it really didnt bother me. In her early days of socializing, she became friends with a group that I could not  for the life of me, believe were real or their lives because it seemed so far fetched. However, Annie idolized them! Well call them Stacey and Macey. Macey and Annie quickly became inseparable and I would playfully throw in remarks whenever Annie told me about a new adventure they shared. Like, hope you had fun cheating on me with Macey. Please remember, all in jest! I didn't know them, I couldn't hate them. Eventually Annie would start making excuses as to why she couldn't come over, or would already be over with the intention of us having a sleepover with mani pedis and catch up sessions,  but at around 10 or 11 pm!, would say that Stacey and Macey texted and they were going to this event or that and told her to join. So she would LITERALLY, get ready and leave to meet up with them. I once asked her, how come you have going out clothes when we were only having a sleepover and her response was ""you never know, I like to be prepared"" !!!!!!!!! I was confused because you obviously wouldn't carry going out clothes like that to come over to mine because we never go out like that. So what....in the world!!? Anyway I digress,  3 years into Stacey,Macey and Annie's friendship, the worst of the worst happens, Macey and Annie have a falling out with Macey Eventually calling Annie's mom to ""notify"" her that Annie is behaving rather recklessly and should get a pregnancy test ASAP and a mental health check or even get her checked into a mental health centre! Annie's mom was out of state and called my parents to and asked us to house her till she got back. I was scared for my friend that night and helped get her clothes and helped her get showered and changed and literally dried her hair with my own hands coz she was so fragile at this point. The next morning I gave her the cold hard truth and told her those people are not her friends no matter how high the pedestal she put them on might be! She wasn't pregnant but yes she was struggling with her mental health. 

Fast forward 3 years and I was getting married, I called her 3 months before my wedding to come over for coffee because I wanted to discuss the wedding with her. I didn't tell her over the phone but I was planning to ask her to be my maid of honor. She said she'll be by at 3pm. She didn't show up. She didn't pick up her calls. The next day she messaged and apologized for not coming over or answering my calls. And said the meds she's been taking for her depression makes her really tired and also, makes her feel out of sorts, just no emotion. I was understanding because bitch! mental health is important to me! However!!!!, I find out a month later that on the day we were suppose to meet for our coffee date, she had gone out with friends that night! I was fuming! Smoke outta my god damn ears! I called her and I asked wtaf! She apologize and said she had bought those tickets  months ago and didn't want the money to go to waste. I cut the  call and gave myself a month to calm down because wtf!


Fast forward to 2022! I'm married with 3 kids, she's in a serious relationship and she and her partner have 1 kid who is a year old. My friends at work, at the time, we're constantly asking me join them out but I felt like was so old to be joining them because I'm 32 and they are 23 and 25. There was to be a garden musical show with local bands and I thought oh cool Annie would love this, she loves local artists. So I asked her 1st and she was Keen!!! Even after I explained that I would also tell my colleagues to join as I didn't want to be rude and going with them 1 time seems fair and if it wasnt my kind of people, she and I could still have a good time together. She was alllllll for it! 

2 days before the musical, Annie called to confirm time and place with me, seemingly ever so excited. And I truly was so excited because since the kids we haven't had much catch up time. THE DAY OF THE MUSICAL.....she texts 
Annie- hey I'm so sorry, I can't make it.
Me - why not?
Annie - J (her partner) got so I'll last night, he had a seizure and I honestly thought he was getting possessed, I lit incense and everything but it was a seizure, he's never had them before so I was in such a state. He eventually came to and I helped him to the bed and gave him calming meds and he managed to sleep through the night. So I'm just gonna stay home with him.
Me - omg I'm so sorry, yeah no problem, take care of j and give him my best regards, I hope he feels better soon. 


That evening we still decide to go out, however because of the rain, the musical was canceled and we ended up at the mall, we were just gonna get food and chill. But life does funny things and I think it's only funny for us after 2 years or so. Can you guess who I run into at the mall, spotting a fresh set of nails and looking as white as a ghost when she sees meeee...yep, Annie stands frozen! FROZEN! She eventually unfreezes, smiles and rushes over to me and hugs me and starts rambling about how awful her day has been, how her nail tech screwed up her nails and how she been taking care of her sickly partner and just full on guilty ramblings. All the while, I just stood there, quietly listening and not even nodding or acknowledging all her excuses and stories. The only question I asked her was, so where is your partner? And she said, oh he's outside by the food court. Looking so guilty the whole time!

I gave her half hearted hug and walked away. That night I made an internal decision, that I was done! With her and her lies and being her secondary friend. She was my best friend but I was not hers. And I wasn't even mad or raging, I was utterly disappointed with myself because I defended her multiple times to so many people including my family. I decided to not even message her about it or express how I felt because I realized there was no point. My sister continues to text with her here and there and it doesn't upset me at all. But i have cut ties since. She invited me to her kids party that same yeat and i didn't go because 1 its a cut off and 2 she blew of most of my kids birthdays. I havent blocked her or anything, she hasnt texted to ask, hey whats happening, why are you being distant? No apology or anything. So i left it as is. There is alot more that happened in thos 17 years and alot that i havent mentioned about how badly she treated me as a friend because its too much but i need to know, am I the Asshole?",4,1737220014.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,4,1.0,False

We definitely share the load around the house and he‚Äôs a great partner. I got our toddler up and got her out of bed, nursed her, changed her diaper, got her dressed. I had to do some maintenance on a fish tank, and he was playing with her. Suddenly his back started giving signs it was about to go out (he has issues with irritated disks, this isn‚Äôt a new thing) so he went and laid on the couch to ice it. I finished the fish tank, while entertaining her, changed her again, then offered to make them both some eggs, and coffee for he and I. I get breakfast made and coffee brewed, and bring them their plates. As I‚Äôm walking away to go do the other necessities (switch his ice packs which he‚Äôd asked me to do a few mins prior, get coffee together, finish cleaning, etc.), he says, ‚Äúthanks for cooking‚Äù. I kept going, picked up old ice pack, and started toward dishes, when he says in an annoyed tone, ‚Äúdid you hear me? Aren‚Äôt you going to say you‚Äôre welcome?‚Äù
So I am known for being a bit ‚Äúspicy‚Äù, nothing new, I‚Äôm not usually angry but I am sassy.

I ask if that extra info changes his mind, he says no. I of course now am actually mad and pretty sure I‚Äôm right, but interested what the community thinks.

I started having stomach pain July 2023, insanely bad cramping aswell as awful migraines. My gp guessed endometriosis and diagnosed naproxen - NSAID (irresponsible!!!)

I was sent for ovarian scans.. nothing found related to stomach, pain continued. It kept getting worse and peaked in Oct 2023 when it was sore i had to leave a social outing becausd i couldnt stand up. Gp kept fobbing me off and finally did an H Pylori test - negative, I did fodmap etc - i was no better.

Summer 2024 i had two group holidays with friends which were awful? i was vomitting stomach acid, going to bed early, not fun because i was feeling so awful and it was the beginning of horrendous belching!! Then finally had an endoscopy august 2024 - several ulcers and gastritis. omeprazole helped a bit but still very painful, second endoscopy in oct showed ulcer healing but still lots of gastritis. 80mg omeprazole prescribed which I later changed to lansoprazole cus headaches and it wasnt really working. Ive had no help with advice, was promised a dietitan app, finished my set of PPIs and currently cant get more due to gp moving to a new app which is absolutely shite - and impossible to get an appt. I need to have a consultation with a gastroenterologist but its SO hard to get via NHS.

During this long time, Ive been to A&E (they just checked my heart, thankfully it was fine), Ive called 111 twice and told they cant help. I dont drink or smoke and eat healthy plant based diet (&fish sometime). I cut out coffee and still not drinking which was very hard for me, it helped for a week and today i feel worse than ever. bedbound. sick of no answers, sick of noone understanding, fed up of my work being affected and canceling plans to lie at home witb this burning awful feeling and waking up in the middle lf the night to belch. its HORRID. I am freelance so havent been able to have sick days to rest during this. 

right now im wondering should i call 111 and ask for lansoprazole as emergency... i have been booked in for a stomach ultrasound with no communication as to why, and not until 29th april. right now im self medicating with nexium, deflatine, milk of magnesia and buscopan. Cant tell if its making it worse.. its not relieving me thats for sure.

I dont know what i expect from this post, just shouting into the void to say to everyone else suffering im SO sorry if youre going through this, it really does ruin your life...

Are there ANY helpful tips for quick relief while i wait? shoukd i just cough up and go private? or push for a third endoscopy to see if its getting worse? it feels like it is :(",1,1737219772.0,Gastritis,2,1.0,False

1i4bvuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1i4bvuy/can_you_brighten_your_smile_at_home/,Can You Brighten Your Smile at Home?,"Teeth whitening can feel like a gamble. There are so many products out there, and it‚Äôs tough to know what works without wasting time and money. I‚Äôve tried whitening strips, toothpaste, and DIY remedies, but nothing gave me the results I wanted. Professional treatments at the dentist seemed like the only real option‚Äîuntil I tried **Laughland teeth whitening**. Here‚Äôs how it went, step-by-step.

# Why I Wanted to Try At-Home Teeth Whitening

Years of coffee, tea, and the occasional red wine left my teeth stained and dull. I wanted something that could help brighten my smile without leaving me in pain. Professional whitening felt out of reach due to the cost (often $500+), so I turned to Laughland after hearing about its **dentist-designed formula** and **LED technology**. The idea of getting professional-level results at home intrigued me.

# What‚Äôs in the Laughland Kit?

When the kit arrived, it included everything I needed:

1. **Whitening Gel Pens**: The gel is specially formulated to lift stains without damaging enamel.
2. **LED Mouthpiece**: This activates the whitening gel to enhance its effectiveness.
3. **Simple Instructions**: A guide that made the whole process feel easy and straightforward.

The applicator pens made it simple to target specific areas, and the LED device felt lightweight and comfortable in my mouth.

# How the Whitening Process Works

Here‚Äôs the breakdown of how I used the Laughland teeth whitening kit:

1. **Brush and Dry Your Teeth**: Clean teeth help the gel stick properly.
2. **Apply the Whitening Gel**: Twist the pen to release the gel and brush it onto your teeth.
3. **Insert the LED Mouthpiece**: Turn on the LED light, pop it in, and let it work for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse and Repeat**: After the session, rinse your mouth and clean the mouthpiece.

Each session took about 10 minutes‚Äîshort enough to do while scrolling through social media or catching up on emails.

# What I Noticed Over Six Days

* **Day 1**: No big changes yet, but my teeth felt fresher.
* **Day 3**: By this point, I noticed subtle improvements. My smile was brighter, and the stains from coffee were starting to fade.
* **Day 6**: My teeth were visibly whiter‚Äîaround 6‚Äì7 shades brighter! The best part was how natural the results looked.

One thing that really stood out was the **lack of sensitivity**. Whitening strips always left my teeth feeling sore, but with Laughland, I didn‚Äôt experience any discomfort.

# Why Laughland Stood Out to Me

After trying multiple whitening products in the past, here‚Äôs what made Laughland different:

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel**: The gel was designed to be strong enough to remove stains but gentle on enamel.
2. **LED Light Technology**: The LED mouthpiece helped the gel penetrate deeper into the enamel, speeding up the whitening process.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Ingredients**: The gel is stored in a controlled environment to maintain its potency, unlike some store-bought options that lose effectiveness over time.

**Want to check out the Laughland kit for yourself? You can learn more** [**here**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)**.**

# Comparing Laughland to Other Whitening Methods

* **Whitening Strips**: Convenient, but they often cause uneven whitening and leave teeth feeling sensitive.
* **Whitening Toothpaste**: Great for maintenance but not strong enough to remove stubborn stains.
* **Professional Treatments**: Effective but expensive, and they often leave teeth sensitive for days.

Laughland felt like a middle ground‚Äîit offered professional-level results at a fraction of the price and without the pain.

# FAQs About Laughland Teeth Whitening

Here are some questions I had before trying the kit, along with what I discovered:

1. **Is it safe for enamel?** Yes, the formula is designed to be gentle while effectively lifting stains.
2. **Does it work on old stains?** It did for me! It tackled both recent coffee stains and older discoloration.
3. **How long do results last?** This depends on your habits. Avoiding staining foods and practicing good oral hygiene can keep your teeth bright for months.

# Tips for Getting the Best Results

1. **Stay Consistent**: Use the kit every day for six days to see full results.
2. **Limit Staining Foods**: Avoid coffee, tea, and red wine during the whitening process if possible.
3. **Maintain Oral Hygiene**: Brush and floss daily to help preserve your results.

# Final Thoughts: Is Laughland Worth It?

For me, Laughland teeth whitening was worth it. It‚Äôs easy to use, doesn‚Äôt take much time, and gave me noticeable results without the sensitivity that I‚Äôve experienced with other products.

If you‚Äôre looking for a cost-effective way to whiten your teeth at home, this kit is a great option. While it may not replace professional treatments for extreme discoloration, it‚Äôs perfect for those who want a gradual, natural-looking improvement.

Tl;Dr: I'm looking to hear other people's experience with non-stimulant medications, specifically if stimulants don't work well for you. Also any other supplement, etc that has been helpful. 

 Hey so first time poster- I was diagnosed with ADHD back when I was 19 or 20 (41 now) but I have been unmedicated most of my life because stimulants make me really hyped up and agitated (I've tried Adderall, Vyvanse, and at least one more, but it's been so long I can't remember what it was. Vyvanse was in the last five years though). Honestly, I've kind of thought the diagnosis may have been incorrect for years for this reason, and because I had some major mental health struggles throughout my twenties that led to a few other diagnoses, all of which I'm unsure of now. Also, my husband has ADHD and while we struggle with some of the same things, my ADHD isn't as glaringly obvious, if that makes sense, and he responds really well to traditional medications.

However, since I've started following this subreddit and hearing the myriad of ways ADHD presents and impacts your lives, I feel so much validation and relief. Like maybe I'm not just some broken freak who can't seem to cope with life or adult like everyone else. I'm feeling motivated to try medication again and try the non-stimulant route. I'd like to hear how strattera or other non-stimulant medication have worked out for others, what side-effects to look out for, how long does it take to see a difference, how many milligrams has been effective... All the things! Also, are there other options out there that have helped? Supplements or other things? I'm currently taking L-Theanine and another mood supplement, though I'm looking for a different one (I'm prone to depression but am currently unmedicated for that). I also drink tea in the mornings (chai or matcha), but can't really do coffee as I can't do too much caffeine.",1,1737219282.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

Instead of tossing the dirt into the trash, I somehow managed to dump it all over the freshly vacuumed floor. Great. So I re-cleaned and decided to mop for good measure.

...And then I knocked the mop bucket over. In the bathroom. Which I had just cleaned 10 minutes earlier.

At this point, I‚Äôm scared to attempt to do laundry.

Di ko alam bakit ang emosyonal ko. Di ko alam kung OA lang ba ako. 

I want to make the most of my stay here. Not my first time in Cebu but my first time to witness Sinulog Festival. My expectation is high. I'm expecting to be tired but elated. I'm expecting that this will be a Cebu visit to remember especially I often go here in Cebu for work. So, this is something I thought that will give me a different view of Cebu -- a happy visit not just Cebu is work, iykwim. 

I honestly forget that today is my friend's wedding which I RSVPed and I have confirmed in my Friday work to weekend extension here in Cebu. Which made me guilty, really, kaya gusto ko sana to make the most of my visit here. Para bawas guilt na pinagpalit ko yung wedding nya for this. But here I am. Alone. Crying.

May kasama ako actually. But in the other room (i guess.. kung nakauwi na sya). 

So, 6:30 PM we're already in our hotel for dinner after our walks in Basilica area. Supposedly, sa Tops kami mag dinner but decided na dito na lang sa hotel since we will go sa rooftop party dito sa hotel. After dinner, coffee then head back to our own rooms na (since nagcoffee na daw and doesn't feel gooing to the rooftop... but i really wanna go). Pero ang awkward naman if ako lang aakyat and iiwan ko sya. So i decided na okay, let's stay in our rooms na lang. But maaaaan!!! I can totally hear the music and vibration here sa room. And nakakalungkot isipin na 'Sana nandun kami sa taas! Having fun! Making the most of the night here!' (Especially when we visited the rooftop nung early pa, i felt the El Nido vibes).  But then... I have found out na while I'm here lying in my bed, lumabas pala sya with his friend here in Cebu for another dinner. I dunno but I somehow felt betrayed. He should've told me na lalabas pala sya para ako without guilt.. went to the rooftop kahit mag isa lang. Don't get me wrong. I'm not used to going alone. I want to be accompanied most of the time specially ganyang party. But I can naman if really no choice. I just feel better If with someone I can laugh, drink and talk with. 

Then dumagdag pa yung isang inis ko. Remember yung wedding na hindi ko na mapupuntahan. I agreed with one of our friends which is a bridesmaid that I'll just send our gift that I've prepared (which paghahatian namin yung cost supposedly) to the venue since she can't bring it her own since malaki yung gift. So yeah. I forgot about it this morning. We agreed na before lunch ko ipadala and we will chat ng morning prior ipadala. Soooo, i totally forgot about it. And sya, waiting for me to chat her. And I was like.. what?? E ikaw yung nasa venue.. Yes. We agreed na before lunch. But I don't know your situation sa venue. Di ko alam kung settled na ba sila. Kung tapos na photoshoot or what. If free sya and can already wait and accept yung gift once dumating. Like why??? Why will you wait for me to chat?? So ang ending, hindi ko napadala and she gave cash as her gift na lang daw. So what about OUR GIFT that we were supposed to share the cost. What about my effort? I even showed you the picture after ko nawrap nicely. I went to the mall (after my work) the night before my flight (5AM) to  buy a box and wrap the gift myself. I even bought cr√™pe paper and manually shred it which is very tedious para maging filler to make the gift more presentable. Which really ate so much of my time. Efforts are nothing for me especially happy naman ako sa ginagawa ko. But all of those were put to waste (not literally tho kasi ibibigay ko parin yung gift dun sa friend but ang downside.. ako na magshoshoulder nang lahat ng cost.. well so be it). Sabi pa nya bayaran ko na lang nagastos mo sa box and wrapper. I was thinking for what??? Sinabi ko sige na lang. 

Kaya here I am. Frustrated. Disappointed. Crying. Haaaaayyy. Itulog ko na lang to siguro. Bukas call time namin 7AM. Dunno if I still have the urge to go with my kasama dito. ‚òπÔ∏è",1,1737218931.0,OffMyChestPH,7,1.0,False

I've monitored my periodontal disease and bone loss for well over two decades. Wore a top, front partial for four teeth for about 7 years. The day came when I had to make the decission to transition to a full upper denture. Teeth were in overall good shape themselves but were all very loose, barely hanging in there, especially a canine.

Extraction date was 1/15. It took me consulting with four dentists to choose the one I felt most comfortable with. So shop around and ask a LOT of questions. It would be an extra few hundred bucks well spent. 2 were very pushy and recomended treatment that was not needed, and not medically sound. Two were spot on, not pushy and with similar quality/level of care and knowledge. 

I got 9 teeth removed, and pretty much painless. The periodontist was incredibly skilled, he answered all my questions before, during and after extractions with zero rush. Bone graft after each extraction and stitches in every socket. Very little bleeding the first two days. The entire appointment took about 1 hr and 45 minutes. I recomend making a ""humming"" sound during this part of the process when they are working on you, it was very soothing to do so. 

Appointment was early morning and by the end of the day I was tired, and a bit sore but manageable. Pain management had been just ibuprofen and two nights of Tylenol 3 half dose. Enough to take the edge off. 

This morning the superficial pain is back (manageable) and the deeper dull pain is almost gone, which is a welcome trade off. I made veggie soups to keep me distracted during the day and I can chew on very soft, small potato squares in it. Liquid diet includes smoothy and coffee for breakfast, a small glass of V8 juice in between meals, protein shake (vanilla) and more smoothie for lunch; hearty veggies soup for dinner (potato and chicken broth based, added spinach, bell pepper, or roasted butternut squash and collard greens). All blended of course.

Took Wed and Thu off work, worked remotely yesterday with lots of talking. C and K sounds are hard! Was so tired at the end of the day. I will be back at the office on Tuesday.

Uppers fit very well, and look quite natural. Remember to take deep breaths, give yourself a ton of slack and grace, and know that it is all for a better healthier life. One day at a time.

Hope this helps with other in their journey.",6,1737218916.0,dentures,4,0.88,False

1i4bap9,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1i4bap9/when_trying_to_avoiding_impulsive_buying_gets_to/,When trying to avoiding impulsive buying gets to your head.,"I need to buy luggage: a personal item and an over-the-head carry-on for three people.   
Regular backpack costs are $70 + $15 for the personal item, totaling $85 each, or $255 for three.  
  
THEN i found the PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT backpack. Originally intended for trekking. Perfect size, It has a detachable top bag that can double as the personal item, to which I could attach our sleeping bag!  
I fell in LOVE with this backpack the minute I saw it. It was 75 USD TOO!   
  
BUT at the counter it turned out the backpack was mislabeled...the price was not 75, it was 130 EACH.  
Thus, buying the 3 would be 390.  
I left.  
Spent 2 HOURS in a coffee shop making the budget again, lists of pros and cons.  
Went  searching  the stores again.  
Searched online  
Called friends to ask their opinion

\*\*\*(OPTIONAL. You might skip this part. This is just me hiperfocusing on this)\*\*\*

  
**Cons:** price. If I have an  extra 135 I might as well spend it in the trip  
**Pros:**  
**PRACTICAL:**   
*Over those little suitcases with wheels:* we are travelling in  the cheapest way possible, and sometimes will not have a place to leave the luggage. THUS having to MIND and not LOOSE it said suitcase... well... Also, this makes one hand needed to be on that suitcase all the time.  
  
*Over other backpacks personal items* = how do I carry both at the same time.   
ONE big item = easier to keep track off.   
This personal item can carry the sleeping bag, thus freeing space in the big backpack.  
WAY better quality= less spending in the future.  
Since it is a specialized for trekking backpack, the woman's version fits PERFECTLY.  
Also, since it is for trekking, it is the best option for the days we will be both walking in new cities AND carrying the backpacks

**Emotional advantages that ALMOST none of my friends understand**  
Vain: Looks GREAT. OMG it looks amazing. I know we will be sleeping in floors but we would LOOK the seasoned traveler part.  
Sensorial: traveling and adventure are about stories. MY trekking backpack is 25 years old. It  has gone everywhere with me, it holds stories, emotional value. I would go with me now, but it is too big. I want my teen sons to have a backpack that will last and be part of THEIR history. This is their first adventure abroad. They are the same age I was when I first took off from my country. HOW we travel is important too.

So, my friends said   
""buy the cheapest one at the Chinese market, reinforce it with your sewing machine, done. It is only for  one time"".   
""it is  your ADHD. This is impulsive buying. dont do it""  
""if it is important to YOU, buy the backpack for you. Ask the teens if this is important to them"".  
And then, one wonderful friend, whom is the only one that has travelled a  lot said:  
You will use this backpack EVERY day of the trip. You'll have to carry it through stairs and mud. It is IMPORTANT to have the best you can afford"" and most importantly... this friend who has money and has travelled all over the world, said ""I have the same backpack. It is worth it every penny""(even if she has the original version, which is around 400 USD)  
  
\*\*\* (end of the optional part)\*\*\*  
  
Turns out, this pack back IS the best option. Rare case in which instant ADHD love is ALSO the best option.   
I wish I had  not spent ALL day thinking and agonizing over it. NOT ALL instant ADHD loves are impulsive buying... Hope the store has not sold it on Monday. I'll have to spend time driving to the store too.

Now My Friends Are Gone.,"Hey everyone, I know I‚Äôm probably going to sound crazy posting this, but I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I need to get this out before I lose my nerve. You see, I went camping in Pine Ridge National Park with two friends, Mark and Erin. It was supposed to be a fun weekend trip, just three friends getting away from everything for a couple of days.

We made camp on a Friday evening, set up near a secluded hiking trail. The first day was perfect. We were laughing, roasting marshmallows, just relaxing. It was all easy-going and fun. By the time we crawled into our tents, we were already planning the next day‚Äôs hike.

‚ÄúTomorrow, we‚Äôre finding that secret lake,‚Äù Mark said, already with the map out. He always had this thing for tracking down hidden spots. He swore my dad had mentioned it once when we were younger. And yeah, I‚Äôve known them for that long. Well, Mark at least. Erin was newer.

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù Erin said, pulling her hood over her head. ‚ÄúAnd if we get lost, you‚Äôre totally on your own. I‚Äôm not going to listen to your directions when we end up on some random cliff.‚Äù

We all laughed and I felt that perfect sense of escape you get when you‚Äôre surrounded by nothing but nature and good company. Pure, complete peace.

The next morning, after a breakfast of instant oatmeal and coffee, we set off with high spirits. The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and everything felt...perfect. That was the only way to describe it. We were talking, joking, making fun of Mark‚Äôs awful sense of direction. But as we ventured deeper into the woods, the trail became harder to follow. The map didn‚Äôt match up with what we were seeing on the ground.

‚ÄúMaybe we should head back,‚Äù I suggested, the growing unease in my stomach making me second-guess everything. ‚ÄúNone of this looks familiar.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, we‚Äôre close,‚Äù Mark insisted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just up ahead.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen this place before, Mark.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou only think that because the memory is so old and foggy. Plus, it‚Äôs got kid-warp.‚Äù

‚Äú*Kid-warp*?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know, when you remember something completely different just because you were a kid when it happened.‚Äù

I was positive that‚Äôs not what was going on, but we followed him anyway.

And then we stumbled upon it.

It happened around midday. We came across a clearing in the woods where the trees grew unnaturally far apart, like they‚Äôd been deliberately spaced. It was a perfect circle, almost too perfect. Does that make sense? The amount of work someone would have had to put into making them *that* evenly spaced would have been insane.

‚ÄúWhoa.‚Äù I was still looking at the trees.

‚ÄúWhoa is right.‚Äù Mark, however, was not.

In the middle of the circle, there was a black pit. Maybe four or five feet wide, but the thing that got to me wasn‚Äôt how big it was. It was how *wrong* it looked. The earth around it was slick and damp. The pit itself oozed a thick, black sludge. It looked like tar but it carried with it an almost coppery smell, this sharp penny-tang that made my mouth water unpleasantly.

‚ÄúWhat the Hell,‚Äù Mark said, walking up to it without hesitation. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs...freaky.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this,‚Äù I said, my voice shaking as I stared at it. The pit was a perfect circle too, just like the trees. Thick globules of black tar dripped molasses slow deeper into its cavernous maw. Small bubbles formed and burst at the edges. The grass directly around it was crisp, yellowed‚Äîdead.

‚ÄúCome on, Chelsea, don‚Äôt be such a buzzkill,‚Äù Erin said, already pulling out her phone to take pictures. She crouched down, snapping shot after shot. ‚ÄúThis is *amazing*! It‚Äôs like something out of a horror movie.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly!‚Äù I threw my arm to the side. ‚ÄúThis is *straight* out a horror movie. Which is why we should go. Right now. We have that lake to look for anyway, right? Mark, aren‚Äôt you dying to go find the lake?‚Äù My voice took on a pleading tone near the end.

But Mark, of course, didn‚Äôt listen. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just take a look,‚Äù he said, grinning like a kid who‚Äôd just found the best secret. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll take five minutes top. The place doesn‚Äôt even look that deep.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Mark, *please*‚Äî‚Äù I started, but he was already climbing into the pit. Erin followed him, laughing.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right behind you!‚Äù she called out, her voice light.

I stood at the edge, watching them disappear into the darkness of the pit. My heart was pounding, and my stomach twisted into a knot. I shouted at them to come back but they didn‚Äôt answer. Slowly, I stepped over to the pit, peeking inside, expecting to at least see them making their way down the tunnel.

Nothing.

Just that viscous black, dripping steadily into the shadows.

A sense of unease settled over me. My body was screaming at me to run, to get the hell out of there, but I couldn‚Äôt leave. Not yet. I told myself they were just having some fun. They‚Äôd come out any second, laughing about how stupid it was. The only reason I couldn‚Äôt see them was because it was so dark.

Minutes turned into hours.

I sat down. I stared at the pit.

I waited.

The sun started to set.

‚ÄúMark? Erin?‚Äù I called, my voice cracking. It was the first time I had spoken in hours.

Nothing.

The forest was quiet, too quiet. When was the last time I heard a bird? I couldn‚Äôt remember. When I got up, my body protested, joints stiff from sitting so long. I walked closer to the pit, peering down into the darkness once again, trying to see any sign of them. But it was empty. There was no movement. I called out.

No answer.

It was going to be dark soon. Unease turned into panic and I decided to call them and *make* them come back up. Don‚Äôt ask me why I waited so long. I don‚Äôt know. I just...did. Maybe it was because I was afraid to admit they were gone. Maybe because I knew, deep in my heart, it wouldn‚Äôt matter. Either way, I fumbled for my phone, but the signal was dead. The screen showed nothing. I tried again, tapping frantically, but there was nothing. Not even a single bar.

‚ÄúMark! Erin!‚Äù I shouted, my voice growing hoarse. I waited a few more minutes, but nothing. No sound. No movement.

I backed away slowly, my feet moving on their own, retreating from the pit. A chill crawled up my spine. It felt like the pit itself was watching me. The scent of copper became almost overwhelming. Several larger bubbles formed in a cluster and popped softly, letting out the unmistakable scent of bile. I couldn‚Äôt stay there any longer. I turned and ran back to camp, hoping maybe they would show up there overnight. No, I wasn‚Äôt hoping. I was p*raying* that would happen.

The camp was exactly how we‚Äôd left it. It was almost fully night now. I flung myself into the tent, then burrowed into my sleeping bag, pulling it tight around me. Sleep came surprisingly quickly. And in the morning...there was still no sign of them.

I grabbed my backpack. My legs felt like jelly, but I forced myself to move. I needed help. I needed answers.

I practically ran all the way back to the ranger station, my breath coming in sharp gasps. The ranger, Paul, was sitting behind the counter, flipping through some paperwork. His eyes flicked up when he saw me.

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs happened,‚Äù I gasped, nearly collapsing in front of him. ‚ÄúMark and Erin...they‚Äôre gone. They disappeared.‚Äù I quickly told him about the pit, the terror returning just at the mention of it. ‚ÄúThey must have fallen in and‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know. Hurt themselves. Gotten stuck. Something!‚Äù

Paul just stared at me for a long moment. He didn‚Äôt seem surprised. He didn‚Äôt look concerned. He looked...sad. Like he had seen this before. Alright,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll put in a call.‚Äù He went to the phone, dialing something. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll send someone out to look. But you should know right now, it won‚Äôt do any good. They‚Äôre gone.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know what he meant, but his tone made it clear he wasn‚Äôt just talking about my friends. It was like he already knew. He didn‚Äôt need to search. He knew exactly what happened.

Search and Rescue came that afternoon. They looked for hours, combing the woods, scanning the area. They looked for the pit. They looked for my friends. They found nothing. No footprints. No signs of struggle. No trace of Mark or Erin. Nothing.

After two days, it was announced that they were gone. That was it. There was no pit. No strange sludge. It was as if none of it had ever happened.

The park closed the case, and the local authorities chalked it up to a ‚Äúmissing persons‚Äù report. Just another number in the hundreds of disappearances that happen in national parks every year. They called it a ‚Äú411 case.‚Äù That‚Äôs it.

I was the only one who wasn‚Äôt content with that answer. I started looking, and I found stories‚Äîthe type people don‚Äôt talk about‚Äîof hikers who just *vanish* in Pine Ridge. Of places that...don‚Äôt exist, even though they‚Äôre right in front of you.

There are a lot of 411 cases in the world. There are a lot of them at Pine Ridge.

But I know the truth. I know what I saw.

I‚Äôve been back to Pine Ridge a few times, looking for that pit. I don‚Äôt even know why. I guess I keep hoping it‚Äôll be there. But it‚Äôs gone. There‚Äôs no sign of it. There‚Äôs no sign of Mark or Erin either.

Sometimes, late at night, when the wind picks up and I‚Äôm safe inside of my tent, I swear I can hear their voices calling to me from the woods. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre trying to tell me something, but the words always fade before I can make them out. And every time I think I‚Äôve found that trail again, it slips away.

I don‚Äôt think anyone will ever find them. But as I‚Äôm typing this, safe in my tent, late at night, once more in Pine Ridge...all I can smell is that coppery tang.

I might not find my friends but tomorrow...I think I‚Äôll be able to find the pit.

And I think I‚Äôm going to go in.",5,1737217523.0,nosleep,2,0.86,False

I can choose between purchasing an old Brikka model (6782) or a new one (7327)

Which model should be better? I am seeing plenty of posts suggesting that newer models are worse so I wanted to confirm. I believe the 6782 has the bigger, heavier valve? on top (can someone confirm?) compared to new models.

I‚Äôm looking for an espresso machine with a built-in grinder for my home. My goal is to make Starbucks-style drinks for myself, especially on weekday mornings (I‚Äôm a full-time barista, so I know my way around coffee).

Right now, I‚Äôm torn between two options:

	1.	Premium Brands: I‚Äôve been eyeing brands like DeLonghi and Breville, which cost around $600‚Äì$800. I love how sleek and aesthetic these machines are, and I know they deliver great quality, but they‚Äôre way out of my current budget.

	2.	Budget-Friendly Machines: My budget is around $300, and there are plenty of options on Amazon from lesser-known brands like Gevi, Kismile, and Ilavie. These machines are more affordable, but I‚Äôm concerned about their durability and whether they‚Äôll meet my expectations as a barista.

My biggest dilemma is whether I should invest in a budget machine now or save up for a higher-end one later. I‚Äôm worried that if I go with the cheaper option, I might regret it in the long run, but the premium brands feel like a big commitment at the moment.

What would you recommend? Has anyone had good experiences with budget espresso machines, or should I wait and invest in something better?

Thanks in advance for your advice!",0,1737216853.0,starbucksbaristas,7,0.33,False
