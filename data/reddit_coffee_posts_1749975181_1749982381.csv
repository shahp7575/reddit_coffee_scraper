1lbwwet,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lbwwet/espresso_guidance/,Espresso Guidance,"First, ‚Äúthank you‚Äù‚Ä¶what little I know I‚Äôve learned mostly from here and YouTube.  For context, I started looking into my first machine in November/December.  While I ‚Äòknew‚Äô that the right path was a separate grinder and machine, WAF, aesthetics and convenience won over.  I ended up with one of those lucky, local YMMV deals on a BBP at TJ Maxx for 500 and pulled the trigger.  While I‚Äôve realized that a better grinder would help me, I‚Äôm 90+% happy with my choice and I‚Äôm more knowledgeable for next time, whenever the bug bites me or this guy craps out.  No Ragrets.  (‚Äúnot even one?‚Äù)

That aside, I‚Äôm here with a question.  I‚Äôm looking to buy a gift for a friend who recently got a BBE.  He‚Äôs thinking the pressure gauge was to be his main guide, something more functional than coolness factor.  I explained why it‚Äôs only a crude indicator of only too-low pressure and the balance between grind size and grind amt and I explained how water temp and bean roast also contributed to making this a very difficult to solve multi variable equation, especially if you‚Äôre constantly switching beans.  His eyes glazed over but the fear within them was still visible.

I want to gift him a care package with a book, some beans and, as a bit of a gag, a lab notebook (he works in pharma, though not in science).  A book that goes into the WHY and HOW of manipulating grinds, effect on extraction and the ensuing physical results (speed, viscosity, flavor).  But, remarkably, almost everything I‚Äôve found online (inc Amazon) are kinda fluffy ‚Äúbarista‚Äù books.  He doesn‚Äôt want to learn the production logistics and ops knowledge for a coffee shop, the subtle stretching techniques of a barista or a ton of content on sourcing beans.  I want to get him an informative, educational yet FUN ‚Äútextbook‚Äù on the science of pressure extraction, why it works, how it differs from other methods and how to optimize your process to pull a good shot.  Any light history, background, etc are of course all good, but it‚Äôs this core technical content I‚Äôm looking for.  Great photos and hardcover would be crema on the cake.  As a gearhead, he‚Äôll eventually likely get into tampers, WDT, knock boxes, etc‚Ä¶.for now the BBE and his existing scale provide everything a novice needs so this is really just about the book.

If anyone has recommendations for us (think interested, inquisitive, slightly nerdy, definitely obsessive, now and forever amateurs), please let me know.  Might even get a one for myself!

Thanks much in advance (and again for all the prior help that you didn‚Äôt even know you gave me).",1,1749982191.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1lbwtn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1lbwtn0/our_cat_slept_in_ute_engine_bay/,Our cat slept in ute engine bay,"My dad drives a ute and drove from home to the local cafe for a coffee (5 minute drive).

He arrives at the cafe and hears a meow coming from his car and decides to pop the bonnet and have a look, to discover our 14 year old family cat in there! (Alive and surprisingly relaxed). 

She often sleeps on top of the car where the engine is to keep warm but we never thought she would tuck herself into the engine bay!

I build ‚Äúminiatures‚Äù, miniature versions of regular things. I‚Äôm working toward building/decorating a miniature church and am very very excited. I am Christian if that matters at all.

. Golden Caramel & Sweet vanilla - tastes a bit watery to me. Maybe I need to try them as a double instead of a mug?

 And of course, the active b6, which to me simply blows them all out of the park. It's rich without bitterness and the almond flavour is actually noticeable and lovely.

Unfortunately, the b6 doesn't seem to have any intensity/roast information, so I cant just look for pods with a similar intensity/roast.

If any coffee nerds are here and have tried all the pods and can tell flavour/roast/intensity profiles just by tasting the coffee- help a girl out.

I know the logical thing is to just buy the b6, but its quite a pricey pod for a double espresso and might not be around for a long time? (Unsure if its a limited line pod, like the summer pistachio and coconut)

At work, I like to sit in my car on my breaks and watch Netflix, so in the hot weather, I‚Äôve been putting a cover over my car's windscreen to try and keep it cool. I also like to get to work early and have a cup of coffee before I start the day, so I'm usually the first person in the car park.

On this particular day, I had allowed some extra time for roadworks, but they were finished, so I arrived 10 minutes earlier than usual‚Äîmuch to the delight of the night security guard, who usually goes home as soon as I arrive on site.

As I'm waving goodbye, I start my usual routine of putting the cover over my windscreen. It has these tabs that shut in the doors to keep it on, but the air pressure from closing the door tends to move them out of place, so I hold them down. This time, however, I wasn‚Äôt paying attention, and as I closed the passenger door, it caught the top of my thumb in the gap.

I wish I could say I let out a manly roar, but in actual fact, I yelled like a wounded animal. I quickly reached for the handle to free my poor thumb, but I had forgotten that I was holding my car keys in my other hand. In a maneuver that I would usually find hard to replicate, I somehow managed to lock the car as I grabbed the handle.

Now slightly panicking, I fumbled with my free hand in a desperate attempt to unlock the car and managed to drop the keys. They bounced off my work boots and landed firmly under the car.

""No worries,"" I thought, ""I‚Äôll just call the security guard to come back and free me."" However, my phone was sitting proudly in my now-locked car.

In a fit of frustration, I kicked the door‚Äîleaving a nice big dent.

After what felt like an age, but was probably only about 15 minutes, one of my workmates turned up and found me contemplating whether to endure the embarrassment or gnaw my thumb off.

I chose the former, hoping he would quickly assist me in my predicament. Alas, he was too busy laughing.

Thankfully, he managed to compose himself enough to retrieve my keys and free me‚Äîand my now very sore thumb.

Apart from a bit of bruising, nothing was broken. Though my embarrassment was far from over, as the whole ordeal was caught on the security cameras.

Having watched it myself, I must admit‚Äîit is quite funny.

TL;DR: Tried to keep my car cool by covering the windscreen, accidentally slammed my thumb in the door, then locked myself out of the car‚Äîwith my phone inside and my thumb still stuck.

Daniel from the cafe here.

We wanted to give an update on the cafe now that we've been in Ipswich now for about 9 months. 

Firstly, thanks to everyone who has come in and seen us, everyone has been very welcoming. We did however get broken into a few weeks ago, but I know that ain't representative of the community. 

I've listed out all the new details for people, but of course, if you have any questions, happy to answer. 

Hope everyone's first half of the year has been fun.

**NEW STUFF BELOW**

We have some new hours:

* Coffee and food only (no Cat Lounge):
   * Mon - Fri - 7am to 10am
* Cat Lounge (and full cafe)
   * Wed - Sun - 10am to 8pm
      * We're not running sessions between 3 and 4 to give the cat's a bit of a nap. 

We wanted to give everyone a bit of a run down on how the space runs:

* The Cafe Space
   * This is a space for everyone and is free, alas no cats. 
      * We don't expect people to order food if you just want to come and read our books or play board games. 
   * Food-wise have added P**izza** to the menu and we're still running Jaffles, some light breakfast options and vegan cakes. 
   * Coffee-wise, we still have Dancing Bean as our coffee supplier, and we're planning to get an only store up and runnning to order your beans to pick up at the store. 
   * We also have bubble tea, frappes, house made sodas, and we're looking into smoothies. 
* The Cat Lounge
   * This is seperate all together and is home to our fosters
      * Note on the cold: we keep the temperate at around 24 degrees for the cat lounge. 

We also have some weekly events for everyone:

* Wednesday night
   * We're looking into an art night where people can come in and paint on the windows every week (SFW of course)
* Thursday night
   * We do board game night, if you want to bring your own in and play with friend, feel free. 
* Sunday night
   * Student study night, all students get 10% off all drinks and food. 
* We're current looking into adding a weekend dog wash out the front and maybe a food truck, but we'll keep everyone informed on that stuff.

But yesterday, I thought I‚Äôd get things done, so I took 27mg Concerta and 2000mg L-tyrosine. I also ordered a large cold brew‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt know it had three times more caffeine than regular coffee. I thought it was just an iced coffee, no big deal.

But later, I started to panic and felt so anxious, I had never experienced that before. I ended up calling an ambulance cause I was scared. The ambulance staff told me my highest heart rate was 130, and that it was okay. They said the caffeine just made me super anxious.

When I got to the hospital, they did an ECG to check my heart, and the doctor said everything was fine. They gave me an anti-anxiety medication, and I left.

I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection and engagement with another person.

I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul. All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you?

I'm 34, male, and live in the US (Michigan).

*I strive to engage in genuine and thoughtful discussion.* I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire from and offer another. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. There's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests to what makes someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. Honestly striving to embrace and integrate the more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them, is an attractive ideal of mine. I want people who show up as their real, authentic, messy selves, with a gaze that's elevated towards something majestic.

*Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the material is essential for me.* I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive splendor. People who are genuinely weird and different are inherently interesting to me. I long for someone who can mirror me back, but sometimes a person with a wholly different perspective and axiom can see and mesh with you best. I peak with ideation and whimsy, desiring compatibility over a clone, and seek out others who do as well.

*Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.* I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. What does that mean? I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me, and I appreciate and admire many different types and expressions of it.* Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from chats to lengthy letters, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it as time goes on.

*More casual and practical hobbies of mine include incense, time pieces, archiving, organization, collecting, and coffee.* Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.

*I'm INTJ, Type 5, score very high in openness and conscientiousness, and am a Virgo.* I list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find most of these sorts of metrics and tests to be largely bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people and have since I was young. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? Are we capable of more in life from having met than never having crossed paths? Chat me up. Leave your hesitations and take the chance. Let me get to know you, from what within my ad resonated with you to what you're seeking, and a few basic details to initiate the start of a foundation.

I watched it in the 90s, maybe early 2000s, and it was a midday movie. Basically this lady was trying to set her best friend up with her husband. When she'd come over for a BBQ she'd say, ""Can you go out and put sunscreen on (whatever his name is)"" or they'd all go out for dinner and she'd say, ""could you please order? He likes the steak."" After a while the friend asked why she seemed to be trying to set her up with her husband, and it turns out she was dying from cancer and wanted to make sure her husband would be looked after. There was one part I remember where they were out having coffee, and (the dying woman) ordered cake. Another lady came up to her and said, ""How do you manage to stay so thin eating a cake like that?"" She simply replied, ""Cancer. I have cancer.""

I am 100% aware of the mistakes I did and I know they could be fixed if we both wanted it. The thing is I have been going through the toughest period of my life, 3 family deaths, lost my job, financial problems, hospitalized. All in the span of 3 months.
During this time, we started fighting a lot over the small things. 

We were together for 4 years, lived together for 3, and had what we both considered the dream relationship, above disney movies type of romance.
We were also each other‚Äôs firsts. That‚Äôs what makes the bond even more special. One day she decided to vent to her mom and friends about what wrongs I did and they encouraged her to leave me. Ofc they did, if she avoided the positive stuff. She was super stressed lately and she held everything that was upsetting her for herself, she didn‚Äôt communicate with me properly, I found out only after the BU that she was crying when I was not home and not even her mom knew it. She gave me subtle hints about what was upsetting her but also she was the most loving and caring person, she would herself initiate intimacy almost every day and I could see she was still attracted to me. I didn‚Äôt doubt her love not even once. But she told me she was secretly hoping I would change by myself, cause if ‚ÄúI wanted to I would‚Äù. I wish she would‚Äôve been more open to communicate her needs properly instead of hoping I will magically change.

But yeah, after 4 years she sent me a message to break up with me, then the post-breakup timeline is this:

1st day we met she was angry yelling at me, repeated herself again

4th day: met but calm this time, very emotional, kissed and asked me if she should forgive me, I told her she has to make the decision, she was still confused

5th day: she was sending me cute selfie and message about how beautiful the flowers I gave her were, still said she s sure about her decision 

~1st week: split things at our apartment, bit emotional, but slightly cold towards me and disappointed I guess, she grabbed my hand while we were walking outside and told me to learn from this so the next girl would receive the love she always craved.

Exchanged maybe 2 messages in the meantime

~3rd week: met in person and she invited me to split some food while she spoke to me pretty nice and warm for around 20 mins, telling me about her life

~5th week: sent her a long message where I took accountability for my mistakes and how I understood her needs and how I made her feel, not asking for anything in return, just wished her happiness and to take care of her heart. Also mentioned I still love her deeply. She responded with a wish similar to mine

Been almost 3 weeks since then and I don‚Äôt know if I should go to her to stand my ground and explain what I understood clearly during our time apart or if I should text her to go for a coffee. 

I still feel like we got so many things left unsaid and for a relationship of 4 years it just doesn‚Äôt feel right. I feel like I had my chance to get her back right after the breakup when she got emotional cause now she seems detached after moving in with a very bad influence girl. But at the same time I wouldn‚Äôt been able to learn and grow from this experience if it wasn‚Äôt the distance and silence. This helped me change my bad habits and now I know I can treat her exactly how she wanted me to do in the relationship, but it may be too late. I know most will say to continue NC but she was pretty anxious and one of the reasons of the breakup was ‚Äúnot making her feel seen or appreciated enough and that I did not love her fully‚Äù. I obviously love her more than anything in this world but her trauma made her feel anxious all the time and she wanted constant validation. Going NC would further confirm her fear of me not caring for her, and also what more can I lose if I already lost her? 

I feel that now I‚Äôm fine with any outcome and I don‚Äôt act out of desperation anymore, I just want to speak with her like 2 mature people. Ofc I want her back, but I will respect her decision anyway if she will refuse to speak.

I used to enjoy complex and/or long games, but today I only have a couple of hours a week to play and that is not conducive to those types of games.  I have also found myself increasingly moving to more cozy styles of games, as I like the tone of them.  I am still struggling to find the right games, however.  Last year, I only played Wilde Flowers --- it took me about 8-9 months to finish --- and while I liked it, I still only rated it 3.5/5.

I decided to try a wide variety of different games this year, but still did not find anything I rated more than a 3.5.  This is what I have tried so far this year:

* Assemble with Care - 3.0.  An OK story, but not very engaging.
* Botany Manor - Demo only.  It seemed OK, but I was not interest enough to continue.
* Coffee Talk - 3.5.  Good writing, but I was looking for something more.
* The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood - Demo only.  It seemed too dark for my taste, and I find 'choices matter' games stressful.
* Dolphin Spirit - 3.5.  I enjoyed the exploration and the ecology themes, but found the gameplay a bit too simplistic.
* Dordogne - 2.5.  Annoying mechanics and I felt let down by the conclusion.
* Gris - 2.0.  I gave up about half way as I did not understand the game or have any fun.
* Naiad - 2.0.  The best parts were repetitive and boring, the worst were tedious.
* Mika and the Witch's Mountain - Demo only.  It seemed like I would find it frustrating.
* Pine Hearts - 3.5.  I liked the story, despite its simplicity, but was looking for a little more from the gameplay.
* Station to Station - 2.0.  I very quickly lost interest and just found it annoying.

Of the 3.5/5 games, there were some similar games that I had played in the past.  Dolphin Spirit reminded me a lot of Alba: A Wildlife Adventure (3.5) and Beasts of Maravilla Island (3.0).  Coffee Talk reminded me a lot of VA-11 Hall-A (4.0), though I am only occasionally a fan of a visual novel or kinetic novel.  Pine Hearts was surprising, as I normally do not like Metroidvania as a genre --- perhaps it was the cozy nature that made it work?

I know I generally need a narrative-driven game.  Score focused games (eg Station to Station, Dorfromantik) quickly lose my interest.  Although Pine Hearts did not have a lot of plot, all the small stories in the side quests were enough to keep me going between the plot bits.

Do you have any suggestions on games I should be trying next?  Narrative-drive, not too long, no choice or time stressors (time limits also stress me).",2,1749978719.0,CosyGames,1,1.0,False

The beggining of our relationship was kinda confuse. I was 21 and had almost no experience in life. I grew up kinda overprotected so he taught me a lot about being in the world all by myself and havong to deal with things on my own and not panick about every little thing. BUT...
When we were just knowing each other as ""friends"" he convinced me to take care of his dog and house for a week while he was on a family trip on another country, he convinced me saying it would be nice for me to be alone in a house, have time and space for myself. So i did took care of his things while he was away, but as i was in love i just spend that week thinking about him and when he was coming back. We started dating months after that. Then, again he had to go away for work, another state (where his old girlfriend currently lives), he came back saying he would try to take me the next time but i didn't happen. I think it's important to say that i am not a person used to this concept of traveling, i grew up poor, my parents never had a car so traveling is something that always seemed so far away from me.
Last year, we had a flood on the state where i live in, people from my family lost their houses, had to leave all behing to survive (it's everything fine now!!) during that one of his friends lost his grandpa so he had to go to another state as soon as possible to deal with everything so my boyfriend dropped everything (me, his dog, his family, my family) during all this chaos to go on this trip, i felt abandoned and honestly a fool, while i was having panick attacks and thinkings it was the world's end he was traveling again without me and again he came back with lots of gifts to make me forget everything. 
In the beginning of this year we broke up, we didn't talk for weeks, while that i was experiencing life as a single women and it was pretty cool, i felt powerful. while that he went to 3 different states with his friends (who all live away) but then when he got back he came after me, and now I'm just thinking that soon he will dump me to do the same thing. i feel like a fool, we grew up in very different realities and some things are just so easy for him, it's not envy, or perhaps maybe a little but i feel really bad when i compare myself to theses situations because as much as he loves me, he continues to feed my imagination with promises that never happen. he talked a lot about going places, doing stuff, enjoying life but never here, in my city, where nothing happens because it's a small town but fuck it's where i am! he won't go out with me to a coffee shop, or places like that because it's boring but i bet if it was another city he would be delighted to go and talk about it later. i don't know what to do and I've been thinking about breaking up with him because i don't want to spend another year waiting for him to do something fun with me, take me seriously as his partner... i don't want his life but i wanna be part of the good parts which for him are not here, where i am.

The warm wind caressed my face while I watched the island slowly approach from the boat. I must say that an abandoned Dominion cattle farm on an island on a seemingly abandoned cattle world is the last place I would have guessed I might end up going when I was told to show up at the spaceport with the clothes for a couple of weeks.

The ship quietly docks, and I jump onto the ruined concrete of the pier. Everything on the surface appears abandoned and overgrown, but I can see that it is a carefully crafted illusion.¬† Hadn‚Äôt I been invited to this place, which seems so quiet, it would have quickly turned into a death trap.

I enter the dilapidated farm, wondering when and where my escort will show up. This place is a time capsule: the instruments, the betterment logos, the blood smears and the floor‚Ä¶nothing on the surface has changed here since the dying days of the Dominion.

‚ÄúSo you are the sword I have to babysit for the next two weeks?"" I hear a mildly annoyed voice from a dimly illuminated corner.

‚ÄúI guess I am, with whom I have the pleasure to speak?‚Äù

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt call it a pleasure, you spooks keep trying to stick your noses where they don‚Äôt belong. Anyway, I‚Äôm colonel Lev Kotelnikov, and let me give it to you straight: I will not allow any bullshit you might try. Am I clear?‚Äù

I look up and down the man in front of me, from his brown hair and pale green eyes to his polished shoes, past his immaculate uniform despite the dustiness of the place. And I retort: ‚ÄúColonel, I have no intention of overstepping in someone else's territory, but there is concrete evidence that the feds might have violated the zone‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs impossible, even the Shadow Caste has pitiful stealth tech and heck, even the Consortium is lacking on that front‚Äù he interrupts me.

‚ÄúThere was a rather persistent rumour a few years back about a second-gen stealth ship going missing or crashing. Supposedly, it was called the *Tem√ºjin*.‚Äù. He glares at me. I continue: ‚ÄúLook, I don‚Äôt want to step on anyone‚Äôs toes here. I would be more than glad to be wrong. Going by the dots tattooed on your right hand, you were probably a ghost. If my age estimate is correct, probably one of the first. I understand why you want to protect your former colleagues, and I have nothing but respect for them. I collaborated with them when I worked for the wet section. I would never put them in jeopardy. And we just need to cross-reference some records, shouldn‚Äôt take too long‚Äù.

‚ÄúHold on to that thought. Fine. Follow me‚Äù. He looks at me with what I think is a hint of respect before leading me down a dusty corridor.¬† He reveals a hidden panel with a Palm Scanner. After his authorisation is confirmed, a wall starts slowly moving, revealing a dimly illuminated room with only a guard and an elevator.

We enter the elevator and begin a long, almost infinite descent. After an undefined number of minutes, we arrive in what is a surprisingly vast military base. He leads me down a series of corridors and doors.¬†At last we enter a room, with only a series of lockers, a printer, a bored guard and behind her a red door. They greet each other, like old friends, and then he explains to me that it is not allowed to carry pads and other electronics inside the archives. I explain that we are talking about hundreds of records from the last five years.

‚ÄúBefore you print hundreds of pages, leave your pad here, I‚Äôll show you something.‚Äù

He opens the red door, and we find ourselves in a warehouse filled with rows upon rows of floppy disks, the big old ones. That would have been extremely dated even before The Fall. I have only seen that stuff in movies like [WarGames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames).

After looking at my face, he just says: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the safest way. The only way to hack into that stuff is to show up with a hatchet‚Äù.

I enter the SCIF with some apprehension. The last few days have been, to put it mildly, a gigantic hole in the water. The colonel and I have checked hundreds of records, without finding anything and with the full knowledge that we have barely made a dent. The only positive news is that our relationship has definitely improved on the grounds of our shared misery.

‚ÄúPlease, Max, tell me that you have something.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat bad? Yes, I think I can make you happy on that front. I narrowed it down to four days thanks to a misfiled police report. I would have found it sooner, but your sheep kept me busy.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up with Vilna?‚Äù I ask with a hint of concern.

‚ÄúWell, you may want to fumigate and‚Ä¶ they want you gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo they? [ŒºŒøŒª·ΩºŒΩ ŒªŒ±Œ≤Œ≠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molon_labe)‚Äù I say sneering, and seeing his confused look, I add: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Ancient Greek it means come and take. Not surprised though, I gave them plenty of reason. Moving on to our spiked friend, what did you find?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt went missing during a hike on the Alps with his master four years ago. Despite the easy path and the clear day, it wasn‚Äôt found for four days. Until it reappeared confused and with deep cuts on its snout.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe cuts could have easily masked a difference. It‚Äôs not like we are particularly good at telling them apart‚Ä¶ Good catch, Max.‚Äù

\[Flash forward a few minutes\]

I find the colonel in the archives expecting me, his military jacket on the chair behind him.

‚ÄúI have good and bad news. The bad one is that we pretty much wasted these last few days‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was evident.‚Äù

‚ÄúTouche. The good news is that we narrowed the interval to four days: 11 to 14 Odin 32.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get the floppies. We are going to need more coffee.‚Äù

\[Five hours and an undefined number of coffees later\]

‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs the last record for the 12th of Odin,‚Äù I hear him say, exhausted. In my addled state, it takes me a moment to grasp the implication. On my list, I have one more record. I watch the data and: ‚ÄúFuck, I have one record more collected by the FTL buoys, for a stealth ship landing in the Austrian Alps of all places‚Ä¶ 40 km from where the Gojid was found.‚ÄùHe grits his teeth, and with the calm voice of someone who is barely controlling cold fury, he says: ‚ÄúI need to inform the Chief Huntress of the border violation. And send more people to check. If we found one, there are at least a dozen we missed.‚Äù

Anyway.. morning starts 5 to 6am for me as i have both kids in my bed and toddler wakes up. Baby wakes but is settled. I do breakie and coffees. When my partner wakes he hops in my bed and cuddles with baby while i play with toddler. When baby winges I tend to them and he goes for smoke. Ill simplify it. He hardly plays with toddler through out day and he always says hes too old to play or he doesn't wont to, which the toddle has learnt mum will play. He is also too tired to clean. He sits on his phone which his job requires communications sometimes but then at nights I put both kids to sleep, the whole routine and all even when he is home. Then he expects us to have sex which I am tired and then he gets angry. 
There is so much more but I cannot put to words like.. i clean up adter his daughter all tge time, like even he goes traveling, i look after everyone and everything. He doesnt let me sleep in by taking toddle afer i have been up feeding all night.

Features step-by-step UI, 12 professional prompt templates, intelligent file prioritization, and smart directory selection.","# üöÄ I Vibecoded a VS Code extension that transforms your codebase into AI-ready context with a beautiful step-by-step UI

Hey r/vibecoding! üëã

I've been working on a VS Code extension called **Next.js Contextify** that solves a problem many of us face: efficiently preparing our codebase for AI analysis and documentation.

https://preview.redd.it/ynqhfyl3327f1.png?width=1615&format=png&auto=webp&s=c45c6c647c79458019d642875fa1f41cbbfeb06c

# What it does:

* **Smart file selection** with an intuitive tree view and checkboxes
* **Professional prompt templates** (12 expert templates across development, analysis, documentation, and specialized tasks)
* **Step-by-step wizard** that guides you through the entire process
* **Multiple export formats** (XML, JSON, Markdown, Plain Text)
* **Token counting** to stay within AI model limits
* **Custom rules and prompts** for specific needs

# The Journey:

Started as a simple file collector, but after user feedback, I completely redesigned it into a comprehensive UI system. The new v2.0.0 features:

# üéØ 5-Step Process:

1. **File Selection** \- Visual tree with smart folder handling
2. **Configuration** \- Choose format and LLM target
3. **Professional Prompts** \- Expert templates like ""Bug Fix Analysis"", ""Architecture Review"", ""Security Audit""
4. **Custom Input** \- Add your specific requirements
5. **Generate** \- Get perfectly formatted output

# üîß Technical Highlights:

* Activity Bar integration for easy access
* Persistent file selection per project
* Real-time synchronization between tree view and UI
* Event-driven architecture for smooth UX
* Professional prompt engineering

# Why I built this:

Tired of manually copying files and crafting prompts for AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Copilot. This extension streamlines the entire workflow from file selection to AI-ready output.

# Screenshots:

The UI is clean and modern - no more command palette hunting or output file management. Everything happens in a beautiful step-by-step interface right in your sidebar.

# What's next:

* More prompt templates based on community feedback
* Integration with popular AI services
* Advanced filtering options
* Team collaboration features

**Coming soon to VS Code Marketplace!** Still in development but the core functionality is solid.

üî• **Bonus:** Works perfectly in **Windsurf** and **Cursor IDE** too! Since they're VS Code-based, you get the same great experience across all your favorite editors.

Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions! What features would make this more useful for your workflow?

‚≠ê **If you find this useful, I'd really appreciate a star on GitHub**: [https://github.com/sriem/nextjs-contextify](https://github.com/sriem/nextjs-contextify)

I am in a specific field, not working but looking for work and right now I have nothing going on. 
I was depressed for a month and didn't do anything and I'm looking for spells to get out of this rut.
I am getting some success with affirmations and manifestation which is mostly just me being hopeful but it's weighing on me badly and I'm not able to cope.
I want to work in this competitive field and I'm just so demotivated and can't even get out bed for the last month.
I come from a place which I'd rather not talk about where some dark aspects are woven in the culture and I'm sure some of my family is involved as I've been unsuccessful for a while now.
I don't know much about all of this, I've done some research but it's mostly from sources that are biased but I do believe in everything, eg karma, astrology, manifestation, god, witchcraft, tarot, etc.
I have a mark on my back that I was told a mark that witches have which makes me so happy.
Anyway I have had my doubts about this career and I'm struggling so mentally and I'm just looking for help.
I can't do an altar or something huge but I have smaller things like spiritual baths and cinnamon in coffee and such things.
I want to something more that actually helps.
So far I got super close and then didn't get the job or the opportunity or stuff like that.
I feel like my whole life is stuck and I want my life to just start, to have money and people and friends and go out and find love, dates, good job, etc 
I don't know if this is too much info or too little so please suggest something that I can do.
I don't work with deities cause idk how but I do believe in God (I'm really mad at him and hate him right now) and I pray to Saturn cause I'm a Capricorn and prolly saturn return.
Even if you can't help, I'd really appreciate it if anyone interacts cause witches are always so nice and it would really be nice to have some kindness.",1,1749978089.0,realwitchcraft,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a FTB from Scotland, I‚Äôm 29 and been renting on my own for 4 years honestly with a reasonable landlord but in Glasgow east end, my neighbours are lovely but I‚Äôm single with no kids and they had 3 young sons so was getting so noisy and I was ground floor which I hated. I managed to save up a fair bit on my own thankfully so thought I‚Äôd start looking for somewhere to buy. 

Went to a broker in February cause my own bank basically told me point blank in January they wouldn‚Äôt lend me any more than 70k. I live in Glasgow so that was gonna get me nowhere but a dump. Broker managed to get me an offer with a building society for ¬£130k. Amazing! 

I started viewings in March. After looking and looking for ages, I found a little 3 bed upper cottage needing a bit of work for offers over ¬£95k in an area next to my friends in April. I offered home report value and not one pence over, and my offer was surprisingly accepted! The person selling it was the daughter of the owner who sadly died a few months ago, so no chain at all, she was just looking to sell fast. Everything went so smoothly. The whole process , the seller and solicitor were great with communication, we completed on Wednesday and I move in Thursday of this week!

Being off street food for quite a while due to some personal goals I planned on going to places that felt nostalgic to me and served IMO the best food offerings you could find in delhi.

Due to lack of time i settled on performing an old school time ritual of mine . Go to hunger strike get the chicken tandoori momos and then walk till moolchand to get their strawberry lassi.

Hunger Strike , Got my momos, there wasn't that much of a rush and the first bite which I thought should have been heaven was just a tasteless, sour mess of a gravy coating a momo with a super bland filling.
Took another to confirm but bro this thing was no where near to what it used to sell. I was wondering how am I going to finish this 8 piece plate. I was lucky I have a friend who can gobble down anything. 
3/10 used to be my definition of 10/10

Walked till moolchand disappointed but also relived that the lassi will make up for it, it was easier when I was in school even with a bigass backpack on my back. Good cardio i guess.

Moolchand paratha, got the strawberry lassi. For the uninitiated this thing used to be thick as in thiccc. You could tilt it to some extent and it wouldn't fall ,the top layer was sometimes solid dahi which had to be had like an actual ice cream to reach the semi solid textured lassi which made up for 2/3rd of the kulhad.
From the start this looked ajeeb, it was not lassi textured and idk how to explain just straight up looked synthetic I thought garmi se hoga and first bite and I was ready to throw it at the person who bought me this. 
I wasn't sure if it was even dahi something totally off and sweet beyond what humans eat this paired with the texture of the lassi i didn't eat more than one spoon and  even my human dumpster of a friend couldn't have more than 2 spoons that is a new low.  asked them to replace.. same shit. 

Cardio wasted.

Wapis aakar Ghar pe hi cold coffee bna kar peeli it was less disappointing as I know I make mid cold coffees but it was still better than what I had yesterday evening.

TLDR: Hunger strike momos are now trash, so are the moolchand paratha lassis which used to super good and I guess street food scene as a whole is going down in delhi.",12,1749977489.0,delhi,7,0.93,False

I got a Cilio Adriana mokapot as a gift. I took it to Italy on my vacation and tried to make coffee with it. I used mokapots a few times before and I also checked the James Hoffmann guide to use it as good as possible.   
I bought some preground coffee at the store which had the mokapot sign on it, cooked water, filled the basket with coffee (Around 3/4 full after some toothpick distributing and some knocking on the table to make it nice and even) and put it on the stove. The first try was ok, the second one sputtered from the beginning, the third also, on the 4th the valve leaked before coffee came out, the 5th also no output and then I reduced the amount of coffee on the 6th and it sputtered again.   
Then I found the Bialetti in our Airbnb and tried that one with the same workflow and coffee grounds and this worked absolutely perfectly every single time. Perfect flow, very smooth, no sputtering.

1lbvls4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1lbvls4/a_week_ago_today/,A Week Ago Today,"I woke up with guilt and shame‚Äîthe night before I'd nailed half a bottle of gin neat. In the middle of the night, I groggily got up and poured the rest down the drain.

Today I woke up with bird song through the window and a silly old black cat on my pillow (not a metaphor)

It's the dawn of the seventh day of no drinks, and I'm feeling very positive this morning. I want to write this down for my own sake to show me what I've done. 

Day one and two were reasonably plain sailing - I think the guilt helped give me momentum through those 'happy hour' moments when I usually started drinking for the day (around 5pm)

Three and four were slightly more challenging once the guilt memory had faded. I was fidgety and had bouts of sugary eating. I'm a fan of spicy ginger beer, which helped too, along with mixers. For some reason, ever since I was a kid, I've enjoyed the taste of bitter lemon and tonic water. This is quite handy, actually, as it's like I'm pretending to drink an alcoholic drink without actually consuming one. 

But it's not enough on it's own.

Day five is where I can see the deviousness of what Allen Carr calls the little monster at work. 

You may recognize the voice: 'Just do this till Christmas and you'll know you can then drink for six months, stop for one, and then start again' or 'see this isn't so hard, you can stop, so that means you can start again' 

This voice tripped me up last time - I went a whole month AF and then I stupidly believed it. 

I'm getting better at remembering that there's nothing in that bottle that is beneficial to me and a whole heap that isn't. 

It's It‚Äôs not all plain sailing, of course, and I haven't been to the bottle bank yet with my old empties, so they sit there in the kitchen. I think on Thursday I had a moment when I was very stressed from work and would normally have reached for a drink. Instead, I took one of the gin bottles that had just a tiny bit left - like a 1mm or 2mm drop in it - and had that. On one hand, that seems rather sad, like when I used to dig through old butts in ashtrays to make a smoke from them (the joys of youth hostelling!). But on the other hand, it was a tiny drop that simply helped silence the little monster. 

This obviously isn't a good idea, using something alcoholic to quiet him down, but I'd done something similar when quitting smoking - having 'the last cigarette' on my desk - and when I got an urge to smoke, simply sniffing the tobacco helped make the craving dissipate. The problem with drink is it's liquid, and you're not going to keep a shot glass of gin lying around! 

Physically, I don't feel much different really - though I did notice during a Zoom call today that my face looked less puffy. Afterwards, I looked in the mirror and I think my jowl is receding (though I also work out, so I can't say 100% it's from the lack of booze).

A wood pigeon is coo-cooing and my cat is now doing that thing where they scratch their ear, so I think it's time for another coffee.

Basically, instead of looking at my morning list of tasks and getting overwhelmed, I break it all down into smaller, more manageable bits. For example, instead of just 'getting ready for work,' I chunk it into smaller actions like having breakfast, choosing an outfit, and doing my hair, and so on.

I get that it might sound super basic, but having these micro-goals helps me knock out tasks one by one without feeling stressed about it all piling up. Plus, I notice that I stay focused way more when I'm not trying to juggle everything in my head at once. It's like my brain appreciates me not treating it like a chaotic server at a 5-course dinner. üòÇ

Anyway, if your mornings are as hectic as mine can be, give chunking a shot. Pour yourself a cup of coffee and tackle those chunks one at a time...

**Season 29 by the numbers:**

* 10.5 MILLION visitors (new record)
* 3,500+ retail outlets operating
* 250+ dining experiences
* 75+ new partners joined
* 80 new business concepts launched

**Why this matters:** If you've been thinking about starting a food or retail business in Dubai, this might be your shot. They're specifically looking for:

* Restaurant and coffee shop concepts
* Open market retail ideas
* Vendors for Road of Asia (prime location)
* Spots in the Indian Chaat Bazaar

**The business case:** 10.5M visitors over a season = massive foot traffic you'd never get starting from scratch. Compare that to opening a standalone restaurant where you need to build your customer base from zero.

**What they're actually looking for:**

* International cuisine (authentic cultural experiences)
* Unique retail concepts (handicrafts, cultural items, fashion)
* Coffee shops and casual dining
* Street food concepts

**Reality check - requirements:**

* Need valid UAE business license
* Food vendors need Dubai Municipality compliance
* Insurance coverage required
* Financial backing for seasonal operations

**Applications are through their official business portal** (search ""Global Village business portal"")

Has anyone here been a vendor before? What was the experience like? The visitor numbers look incredible but curious about the practical side - setup costs, profit margins, competition level, etc.

"" I was kinda shocked. I said ""does it matter just to talk ?""she said "" Why to waste our time ?"" Thikai cha vibes mili rako cha so i shared truly about who I am,  where I belong to.. I also get information of her and we started talking every night for hours.

Tespachi usko exam ako rai cha masters ko, she came to kathmandu, we met. First day I gift her with own portrait ( i asked an artist to make, as i know we were going to meet soon ).  Then we met next time and had coffee together. She was cute but an angry girl, also was over thinker. Sano sano kura pani ekdam analyze garnu parne. yeti samm ki,  ma ""thikai cha"" lie ""thickai cha"" vanera type garthea ... haha she corrected me on it also. .. She was very sensitive vanam and liked it as well.  
  
what happen to her I don't know. Tara she slowly starting ignoring me and texting just once a day, said ki I am busy. beluka bolna pani  kam hudai gayoe. i don't like being ignored. Maile ekdin uslue sodhe normally where you going vanera? she said replied I am brutal re ! am dheari sanka garchu re  bla bla bla ... we were not in relationship yet. Then she stopped replying and after 4th day I unfriend her. 

Tespachi I started doing my own work, traveling a bit enjoying aru kura ma nai ... then after 4 months, one day i don't know why i but like to text her and say I am sorry, if I was really become brutal, also if it had hurt you. i send the friend request then after 8-10 days she replied me, she said it's okay.   
  
Then we again start talking about our normal life, nothing deeper. But in next 1 week she suddenly asked me "" Bahira jane ho ?"". For the second time I am kinda shocked.  Timlie tw ma mann parthea na ....in these gap of 4 months, you never texted me. She replied ki i searched you but couldn't find ( i am not at any socail media ).

Maile vane why you like me ? bihe garna lie aru keta haru pani aye holan.? she said ki ali known, ali loyal timi lagyoe so, also you shared everything clearly  !!! ( but how ahele chai ??? but i didn't asked her )  
I am surprised. But she show her same behavior just texting once a day, not talking about everything deeply. But I suppose if you are going to spend life with some one, isn't it necessary to talk in deep? Slowly it turns into arguments and again she stopped texting or calling me.  Again I unfriend her and i think i will never ping her. 

Its not that critical but small things can change or take away our direction,  where we never wanted to be. I  just want to express my feeling here. And wanted to know what you would do in the situation, how would you take it ?

And now I‚Äôm so depressed that my taste is back to normal that I‚Äôm going insane.,"I thought my ARFID (clinically diagnosed by my psychiatrist around 3 years ago) was bad enough. Every guy I dated HATED it. I tried every food they offered me, but near nothing tasted good. They thought I was just being picky, they didn‚Äôt understand why I was so afraid of choking/suffocating. I‚Äôm diagnosed autistic (back in the 6th grade my therapist diagnosed me) and back then Autistic kids were just normally seen as picky. My parents just fed me what I would eat.

My husband and I have been through quite a bit with my eating habits. He thought it was pickiness but after therapy and a lot of communication, he‚Äôs learned that I hate my tastes more than anyone. Thankfully I don‚Äôt care what others think, I‚Äôll order chicken strips anywhere and bite back at anyone who is judgey about it. That was just how it was. Then my husband and I tried for our beautiful daughter.

As soon as I got pregnant, maybe like 2 weeks in, I could EAT. It didn‚Äôt matter if it was salad, or different ranch dressings. I loved all meats, not just the fast food garbage. I could stomach different pastas, even WATER tasted divine. Fancy dinners with my parents I could try new meals and LIKE them. I didn‚Äôt have to order a burger or Mac and cheese! I could eat veil picatta or fancy lasagna and complex soups without going home hungry.

I could eat all I wanted, all day every day it felt. Obviously I wasn‚Äôt going to drink alcohol, eat fish (which I‚Äôve always hated), and kept my diet clear of the bad things like caffeine that could harm my little one. But all the other foods I could have were AMAZING. I felt like such a glutton but it was AWESOME. I didn‚Äôt have to have the same meal all the time. New things I tried ACTUALLY had a chance of me liking them. Coffee tasted sweeter. I never went to bed hungry. My thirst was always quenched. IT WAS HEAVEN.

Now, three weeks having my healthy, beautiful baby girl‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm back to hating nearly everything I put in my mouth.

I‚Äôm so fucking destroyed. I‚Äôm so depressed. I was so happy to taste normally. To love everything on my plate. To lick the plate clean after nearly every meal. To relish to taste of ANY soda, not just Dr. Pepper.

It‚Äôs 2am. I‚Äôm sitting up crying, wondering how to get it back. I want it back, that appetite. But I obviously can‚Äôt just stay pregnant forever. And there were HORRIBLE things that came with my pregnancy that I can‚Äôt just jump back into. 

I‚Äôm mourning the ability to taste. The ability to eat and feel full. The ability to like what I eat. The ability to ignore textures.

Eating brought me so much fucking joy and now that I know what I can‚Äôt have, I‚Äôm ready to rip my hair out.

Tomorrow I meet with my therapist. I‚Äôve met with a dietician before, too to try and fix the ARFID. But they‚Äôve done NOTHING like pregnancy has for my tastes.

¬†

Promise

¬†

¬†

¬†

¬†

Hindi ko maintindihan.

¬†

Hindi ko matanggap na umalis si Achilles, hawak ang kamay ni Alana. I refuse to acknowledge what just happened, and even my thought about it.

¬†

No... he's just doing that to get rid of me. He doesn't want me to disobey my parents so...

¬†

Naalala ko ang mga sinabi niya. Kahit pa yumaman siya... matanggap siya ng mga magulang ko... hindi pa rin magiging kami.

¬†

Hold on, Marem. Don't believe that. He's bluffing right?

¬†

Hindi ko alam kung ano ang gagawin ko. Hating-hati ako. A part of me wants to run away and believe what he said. I don't want to force myself on anyone. The other part of me didn't want to believe what he said. He's lying just so he could get me to obey my parents.

¬†

Pero hindi ba sa dalawang maaaring dahilan na 'yon, pareho lang na ayaw niya?

¬†

Hindi ba ayaw ko ng pinipilit ako? Hindi ba ayaw ko na kailangang magbigay ng rason kung bakit ayaw ko? Hindi ba dapat respetuin na lang ang desisyon, at hindi na kailangan maghintay ng eksplenasyon? Hindi ba lahat tayo may karapatang umayaw, at umayaw din sa pagbibigay pa ng karagdagang dahilan?

¬†

But even with all those realizations, my feet wouldn't move an inch. Para akong nag ugat na sa lupa kung saan ako nakaapak. Ayaw balingan ang pag alis ni Achilles at Alana, pero ayaw ding umalis at magpaubaya.

¬†

I stayed standing still, not knowing what to do next, and wanting so bad to stay despite Achilles'

pushing me away.

¬†

Hindi na ako umiyak kahit na sobrang sakit na ng puso ko. O baka... hindi ako makaiyak. Masyado akong nalulong sa pag-isip sa tunay na nangyayari, binabalewala ang lahat ng nakalulunod na nararamdaman.

¬†

Dumidilim na pero hindi pa rin ako gumalaw doon hanggang sa naramdaman ko ang lamig ng hangin at unti-unting patak ng mga ulan.

¬†

Suminghap ako at marahang bumaling sa kung saan lumakad nang umalis si Achilles kanina. It's leading to the neighbourhood and at the same time, the door of his house.

¬†

Hindi ko alam kung saan sila pumunta pero inisip kong sa bahay. Lalo na dahil umilaw ang looban dahil gumagabi na.

¬†

The rain slowly poured. At sumilong ako sa kaonting yero sa taas ng bintana sa bahay ni Achilles.

¬†

Saglit lang 'yon dahil minabuti kong tumayo sa pintuan at kumatok.

¬†

""Achilles.

¬†

I felt detached from my self. I don't know why. Dapat galit ako ngayon.

¬†

Hinawakan niya ang kamay ni Alana. It triggered a certain silent rage in me that now... I am completely detached to my own feelings.

¬†

Para bang natutunan ko sa bung nangyari na isantabi ang totoong nararamdaman dahil may mga mas importanteng bagay pang ayusin. Na dati'y lagi akong nagpapadala sa nararamdaman ko, sa galit, sa selos... kaya ngayon sinisikap kong huwag isipin ion. Hanggang sa tuluyan ko nang naiwan 'yon kung saan.

¬†

""Achilles, please, let's talk! I know you're in there!""

¬†

Walang sumasagot.

¬†

Bumaling sa sa mga kabahayan. Hindi ko alam kung taga saan si Alana. Kung kapit bahay ba siva ni Achilles. Pumunta ba sila sa bahay ni Alana?

¬†

Lalong lumakas ang ulan. May ilaw man sa mga sumunod na kabahayan, madilim pa rin dahil bilang lang ang mga ito. At lalong dumilim dahil sa pagbuhos ng ulan. Nababasa na ako ng paunti unti. I am worried about my clothes but I should stop cuz it's petty. I have a heavier problem at hand.

¬†

""Achilles?"" sabi ko sabay katok sa pintuan niva.

¬†

I tried to calm down again as I hear the thunderclaps and the sudden pouring rain.

¬†

Calm down, Marem. This will pay off. Huwag mo munang isipin ang tungkol kay Achilles at Alana. Kailangan n'yo lang mag-usap.

¬†

""Achilles, nababasa na ako dito. Magkakasakit ako.."" | said as I watched the rain soak my shoulder.

¬†

Hindi na kakayanin ng kakarampot na yero na isilong ako sa ganito ka lakas na ulan.

¬†

""Achilles-""

¬†

The door suddenly opened. I saw Achilles first. He opened it harshly, as if impatient. Natabunan agad ng katawan niya si Alana na nakatayo sa likod niya.

¬†

""Bakit nandito ka pa? Hindi ba sinabi ko na nga sa'yo na umuwi ka na?!""

¬†

Napakurap-kurap ako. I ignored my feelings again. Whatever hurt and pain I felt when he shouted the last words, it only added to the pile of pain. Now I feel like a balloon trying her best to keep it together, even when it's about to burst.

¬†

""Eh mag-uusap pa tayo. Sayang ang oras. Naghihintay na ang van para makadiretso na tavo sa-""

¬†

""Ano bang hindi mo naintindihan sa sinabi ko? Ha? I will call your brother and tell him you're here!""

¬†

He reached for his phone. That's when it dawned on me

¬†

llang linggo kong pinaghandaan 'to at marami akong nagawa para lang mangyari 'to. Tapos ngayon... tatawag lang siya kay Kuya para isumbong ako at baliwalain ang mga nagawa ko?!

¬†

I felt like my balloon of feelings got stretched beyond endurance, Kanina ko pa inignora ang lahat. Pati ang matinding galit ko sa pagsama niya kay Alana, kanina, at ngayon nasa lob pa ito ng bahay niya! Tapos ngayon... mababalewala ang lahat ng mga sakripisyo ko dahil tatawagan niya si Kuya para ipaalam ang mga ito?!

¬†

1 slapped the phone from his hand. Agad iyong tumilapon. Achilles' bloodshot eyes snapped at me.

¬†

""Ano bang problema mo?! Ang dami kong ginawa para mangyari tayo tapos sasayangin mo lang ang lahat?!""

¬†

""Hindi ba sinabi ko na savo-""

¬†

I cut him of with a louder shout. ""Na umuwi na ako! Na ayaw mo na?! Oo! You asshole! I heard you but I'm trying to understand it based on how I know you! At alam ko na hindi ka ganito kaya hindi ako naniniwala!!!""

¬†

Napaos ako sa sobrang lakas ng boses ko.

¬†

""What can I do to make you believe it, then?"" Achilles' voice was so cold I shivered.

¬†

Napaawang ang labi ko, hindi inasahan a ganoon ang sasabihin niya pagkatapos kong sumigaw.

¬†

""Sabihin mo sa akin. Ano ang gagawin ko para lang maniwala ka, na totoong ayaw ko na. Totoong gusto ko nang tigilan 'to. Na hindi magbabago.."" unti unting lumakas ang boses niya. "".. ang isipan ko kahit pa tanggapin tayo ng mga magulang mo!"" he said the last words so loud.

¬†

Tumingin ako kay Alana saglit bago kay Achilles. I gritted my teeth and looked at him angrily.

¬†

""Bakit? Ano?! May ibang babae ka na?!"" | screamed with my strained voice Ito ang kanina ko pa pinipigilan na sabihin. I didn't want to conclude. All this time, I was always fast to conclude things like this. I'd like to change it this time.

¬†

l'd like to fight.

¬†

But the time I was ready to fight, he was ready to fold.

¬†

""Ano?! Kayo ba ng babaeng 'yan, Achilles?""

¬†

I tried to enter their house so i could clearly see Alana. Kaya lang hinarangan ako ni Achilles.

¬†

""Tumigil ka na! Huwag mo siyang isali dito!""

¬†

Huwag isali?! Bakit parang pinoprotektahan niya si Alana.

¬†

The stretched balloon... finally... bursted.

¬†

""Huwag isali?! Bakit? Why is she here anyway?! If you don't want her included, why is she here in your house?!""

¬†

Hindi nakasagot si Achilles. Mas lalo lang pumatong ang galit sa akin. This isn't right anymore. I want to believe his promises but it's getting harder and harder by the minute!

¬†

""Ano?! Kayo na?! Oh my god! You cheated on me?!"" I accused him angrily.

¬†

Kumunot ang noo niya at parang may gustong sabihin pero nanatiling tikom ang bibig.

¬†

""You fucking cheated on me?! Huh?!""

¬†

I tried to get in his house. Hinarangan nya ulit ako. Tumama ako sa dibdib niya.

¬†

He stopped me from going in. Napaatras ako dahil sa pagtama sa dibdib niya. Sa pagkakataong ion, nabasa na ako ng ulan!

¬†

I can't believe it!

¬†

""Ano?! Don't tell me sa isang buwan na naghintay ka dito, nagbago ang isip mo dahil sa babaeng 'yan?!""

¬†

Marin ang titig ni Achilles sa akin. I want to think that he's really just bluffing. But I'm already past that. All I think about now... is he cheated. And what if it's true?

¬†

How did he cheat? Did they kiss? Does he love her now? I don't know!

¬†

Pero bakit ko pa nga ba tinatanong ion? Bakit? Kung nagtaksil nga siya, pero hindi niya naman mahal... kaya ko bang tanggapin siya ulit?

¬†

I remember the time when he caught me with Nikolai. Tinanggap niya ako. We were still together, and yet I somehow entertained suitors. That was cheating. I regret it. I love him but I cheated. He still forgave me. He took me back.

¬†

Kaya ngayon... kung nagkamali siya...

¬†

I gritted my teeth. I tried to hold back my tears. Alam kong nagsisikap ako na maayos kami. Na hindi ako bibitiw at lalaban ako para sa amin. Pero... sumusobra naman yata 'to!

¬†

Kaya ko lang naman siyang ipaglaban dahil mahal ko siya! Pero kung hindi niya ako mahal, hindi ko na alam kung laban pa rin ba 'yon o talo na!

¬†

""Ano?! Naghalikan kayo?! Mahal mo na siya, kaya ayaw mo na sa akin?! Ano?!"" | shouted.

¬†

The thunder boomed. My tears were hot against my cold cheeks. The rain is trickling on my hair down my whole body.

¬†

Nanatili si Achilles sa pintuan. Nanlalabo ang mga mata ko sa tubig-ulan at mga luha kaya hindi ko a halos makita ang ekspresyon niya. He's holding the door but he didn't close it yet. O na estatwa ba siya sa kinatatayuan niya dahil hindi na siya gumalaw habang nakikinig sa mga sigaw ko?

¬†

""May nangyari sa inyo?! Nagkamali ka?! Ano, Achilles?! Sabihin mo sa akin!""

¬†

I almost bent from my intense wailing and screaming. Umiling ako.

¬†

""Mahal mo 'ko, eh. A-Alam ko..."" | cried more.

¬†

Hinawakan ko ang dibdib ko, kung saan literal na sumasakit dahil sa mga nangyayari.

¬†

""Bawiin mo, please... Hindi kayo, 'di ba? Hindi, 'di ba? Achilles, mahal na mahal kita.""

¬†

I bowed defeatedly.

¬†

Achilles inhaled harshly and slowly closed the door. Namilog ang mga mata ko at sinubukang lumapit para pigilan pero naisarado niya na ang pintuan bago ko pa naabutan. Bumundol ako sa pintuan at agad ko iyong hinampas.

¬†

""Achilles, please... open up..."" | pleaded.

¬†

Hindi ko na alam kung ilang beses ko yong inulit ulit. Hinampas ko ang pintuan nila hanggang sa humapdi na ang mga palad ko.

¬†

Tumigil na lang ang ulan at halos matuyo na ako galing sa pagkakabasa, nanatili ako sa pintuan, nakahilig at pagod na pagod na.

¬†

Mahapdi ang mga mata ko sa pag iyak. Wala na akong lakas. Kanina pa paulit ulit na tumunog an cellphone ko hanggang sa nawalan na ng baterya dahil hindi ko na ulit narinig na tumunog.

¬†

It's almost midnight. I don't know if they have another door in this house or if they escaped... or if they remained inside... but if they did... then does that mean... Alana is staying here?

¬†

Akala ko wala na akong luhang maiiyak. Fresh tears formed on my eyes as I slowly sat on the floor because of exhaustion.

¬†

I sneezed and realized the air is getting colder, and my wet clothes are making me shiver more.

¬†

""Ma'am...

¬†

Nanatili akong tulala kahit pa may anino akong nakitang lumapit.

¬†

""Tumawag kasi si Sir. Kinakamusta kayo kasi naghihintay siya sa Roxas kanina para sana... uh... siguraduhin na makakapunta tayo sa Concepcion.""

¬†

Ang matandang driver ion ng van na hinanda ni Nikolai para sa amin ni Achilles.

¬†

I forgot about him. But still... I remained sitting and spacing out.

¬†

Hindi ko alam kung ilang sandaling naghintay ng sagot ang driver. Hindi ko siya nabigyan. Wala na akong lakas. At wala na yata ako sa katinuan.

¬†

Nakatulog ako.

¬†

Unti-unti kong dinilat ang mga mata at natanaw ang dilim sa labas at kaonting mga ilaw na nadadaanan. Where am I?

¬†

I looked around and saw that it was a bigger van. Hindi iyong sinakyan ko no'n.

¬†

Napatingin ako sa tabi bago ako umahon sa nakapahigang upuan ko.

¬†

""N-Nasaan ako?"" mahina kong tanong kay Nikolai na tahimik na nakatitig sa akin mula nang umahon ako.

¬†

He sighed before he answered. ""Sinundo kita sa Costa Leona. The driver carried you to this van.

¬†

Nakatulog ka sa... pintuan ng bahay ni Achilles.""

¬†

I paused. I suddenly remembered everything. Was that a dream or did it really happen?

¬†

Natulala ako at inisip ang lahat ng nangyari. Unti-unting bumuhos sa akin ang lahat. Nangilid ang mga luha ko. Hindi ako makapaniwala a totoong nangyari ang lahat ng ion.

¬†

Bumagsak ang kumot na nilagay ni Nikolai sa akin at muli kong naramdaman ang lamig. Halos tuyo na ang damit ko ngayon.

¬†

""Want to... tell me what happened?""

¬†

Hindi ko alam kung paano ko nagawang lagpasan ang mga sumunod na araw.

¬†

Hindi ako pinahanap ni Mama at Papa sa Singapore. Hindi ko alam kung dahil ba nakuha ko na ulit ang tiwala nila o dahil alam nila na hindi rin naman ako tatanggapin ni Achilles kung tumakas ako at magpunta sa kanya.

¬†

Hindi ko alam kung ano na ang nangyari sa akin kung hindi ako sinundo ni Nikolai. They found me sitting while asleep near Achilles' door. I can't believe Achilles didn't even bother to check on me... or even offer me shelter. It was a cold rainy night.

¬†

Pero bakit nga ba ako nag-expect na aalagaan niya ako? Hindi ba, siya pa nga ang nagtaboy sa akin?! Pinagsarhan niya ako ng pintuan! He didn't even worry for me that I stayed there the whole time! He didn't offer me a blanket or an umbrella!

¬†

Nagkasakit ako sa sumunod na araw. Kina Nikolai muna ako tumuloy ng dalawang araw.

¬†

I was devastated and angry. Hindi ko kayang isipin ng mabuti ang lahat.

¬†

Achilles cheating on me? Impossible!

¬†

I know I believed that in that moment. Hindi niya ako itataboy ng ganoon kung walang matibay na dahilan. Sapat na dahilan nga naman na may mahal na siyang iba kaya niya ako tinataboy ngayon.

¬†

Kaya lang... isang buwan. Isang buwan lang. Pinalitan niya agad ako.

¬†

""Kung dahil lang sa parents ko, kaya niya ako pinagpalit. Kung pagod na siya... sana sinabi niya!""

¬†

I cried as I hugged Nikolai.

¬†

Mataas ang temperatura ko dahil na rin siguro sa pagkakabasa sa ulan. I didn't want to eat. Or maybe, a part of me wanted to be so unhealthy. Inisip kong...

¬†

mag-aalala si Achilles ngayong may sakit ako dahil sa ginawa niya. Kung lumala pa ang sakit ko, mas lalo siyang mag-aalala at pagsisisihan ang lahat ng ginawa niya!

¬†

Oo! Gusto kong magsisi siya!

¬†

Pero alam ko rin na kung magsisi nga siya at mag-alala sa akin, natatakot akong tatanggapin ko siya agad na parang walang nangyari.

¬†

""Nikolai, hindi ko kaya 'to! Buong buhay ko... walang nakakaintindi sa akin! Si Achilles lang! Mahal a mahal ko siya! Kayang kaya kong talikuran ang kahit na ano para sa kanya...'

¬†

Nikolai hugged me back as he soothed me.

¬†

""Marem, andito rin ako. Naintindihan kita.""

¬†

Kinagat ko ang labi ko at lalo siyang niyakap. Hindi ko na maintindihan ang nararamdaman ko.

¬†

Minsan, gusto kong magmakaawa. Minsan nagdedeklara ng

¬†

nararamdaman para kay Achilles. Minsan naman... ang poot at galit.

¬†

""He cheated on me with that bitch! Ang tagal ko nang nagdududa sa kanila! Ang sabi niya, wala naman daw?! Tapos ngayon... sila na?!' | screamed. ""Sana hindi niya na lang ako hinabol no'ng nakipaghiwalay ako sa kanya noon! Sana! Hindi niya na ako sinuyo! Hindi na siya nagbanta na iwan ang pagsusundalo para sa akin!""

¬†

Nikolai sighed again as he listened to what I was saying. Hindi na siya makapagsalita dahil sunod sunod ang mga sinabi ko habang umiiyak at nasa kama.

¬†

""Pinagpalit niya ako! Hindi ako makapaniwala! Alam kong... hindi ako mabait...

¬†

iyon ba ang dahilan?! Mas mabait ba si Alana?""

¬†

Humikbi ako habang binabaon ang mukha ko sa balikat ni Nikolai.

¬†

""I know I'm rude... I know... I know I'm not an ideal girlfriend... or wife... but I'm trying my best. I love him so much. Alam kong mahal niya ako... Please, Nikolai... tell me... Mahal niya ako... 'di ba?'

¬†

1 sounded so hopeless but I'm tired of keeping it all in. Nagkahalo halo na ang nararamdaman ko na hindi ko na maintindihan ang sarili ko.

¬†

Umuwi ako sa amin na mayos na ang pakiramdam. Inalagaan ako ng mabuti ni Nikolai sa Iloilo.

¬†

Hindi rin kami nabuking at mukha ring hindi naman nagsikap ang mga magulang ko na siguraduhin ang mga lakad ko.

¬†

Most days, I'm alone and spacing out. Hindi ako tumanggap ng trabaho at ang iba, hindi ko na sinipot. I only wanted to be in my room. I don't understand why I'm still in this house. I said my real life will begin after I elope with Achilles. Now that we didn't... and I'm still here... I feel lifeless.

¬†

I'm not sure if this is a prelude to that life... a prequel to the story of me living a simple life with Achilles... or it already ended in an unfortunate twist. It already ended before it even started.

¬†

Hindi ko na alam kung ano ang susunod na gagawin. Kung bumalik ba kay Achilles at magmakaawa ulit... o... I paused and realized that I didn't have any other option. I don't want to go on with my life anymore. The life I expected the next months, and years, or decades, is a life with him.

¬†

""Dito po ba, Ma'am?"" tanong ng driver nina Nikolai.

¬†

It's been a month since what happened. Lito pa rin ako sa nararamdaman ko.

¬†

Hindi ko alam kung alin ang totoo. Kaya hindi ko rin alam kung ano ba talaga dapat ang nararamdaman ko. I felt like I was floating mid air, and couldn't even land. Like I'm standing on a thin line between love and hate... I have no answer to anything.

¬†

""Thank you,"" sabi ko bago binuksan ang pintuan.

¬†

Nakahanap ulit ako ng paraan para umalis sa Manila at magbalik ng Costa Leona. At dahil hindi ako puwedeng magdala ng sasakyan galing sa amin, driver ni Nikolai ang sumalubong sa akin.

¬†

Nikolai adviced me not to do this but since when did I ever listen to anvone's advice?

¬†

Tinanaw ko ang eskuwelahan. Saglit kong naalala ang nakaraan. Dati, dito ako nag-aaral.

¬†

Achilles was a classmate of mine. He was older than us and yet he was in our batch because he was poor and struggling.

¬†

Saulo ko pa ang lahat na parang kahapon lang. Kung paano ako nahulog sa kanya at paano siya sa akin.

¬†

He is my home. He comforts me from all the pain and suffering. He is my first and only love. I couldn't imagine loving someone else as much as I love him.

¬†

What I have for him is raw, unadulterated love. I couldn't even express it properly back when I was younger, and when I grew into a woman, I finally found a way to love him.

¬†

He was already a man before I came into his life. Or maybe, he was a poor and struggling boy trying to play a man's role for his mother. He was a breadwinner.

¬†

He was always righteous... and had strong principles.

¬†

We clashed so much. I was that rude brat he should've hated. I defied his righteousness and principles. I don't understand how he came to love me when I was always rude... always difficult... and I didn't value fairness. But I didn't know how I came to love him, too.

¬†

When I find him inferior because of his status, and I hated him for imposing fairness... even to me.

¬†

I swallowed hard and started walking beyond the gates of the school premises.

¬†

Suot ang isang wine red a longsleeve designer dress, na may pencil cut na skirt, at isang nipis na stilletos, tuloy-tuloy ang lakad ko sa pamilyar na mga classroom ng paaralan. My long hair is parted in the middle, in a half low ponytail, with the other half on pretty curls below my shoulders Panay ang baling ng mga estudyante sa akin, namamangha. Naaalala ko dati, bata pa ako, ganito din ang titig ng mga estudyante rito.

¬†

Tumigil ako sa faculty at agad kong nahanap ang mga mata ng babaeng sadya ko rito Hindi na inisip na huminging permiso, pumasok ako. Alana looked shocked to see me. I looked around the small room. May dalawa pang teacher na nandoon na gulat din sa biglaan kong pagpasok.

¬†

""Iwan n'yo muna kami,"" iminuwestra ko si Alana.

¬†

Ramdam ko ang pagpupumiglas ng isang guro. Matagal ko siyang tiningnan, hinahamon na suwayin ang gusto kong mangyari. Pero kalaunan, nagsialisan din sila at tuluyan na nga kaming naiwan ni Alana doon.

¬†

I put my expensive bag on Alana's table in front of us. Alana looked at my bag before she looked at me again. Naupo ako sa isa sa dalawang upuan sa harap g lamesa niya. Samantalang nanatili siyang nakatayo doon, naghihintay pa rin sa kung anong sadya ko.

¬†

""Upo ka,"" hamon ko.

¬†

Alana looked at her seat. It was as if she expected something strange from it since I asked her to sit on it. I smirked.

¬†

""Ano'ng kailangan mo?"" tanong niya pagkatapos maupo.

¬†

""Gusto kong malaman mo... na hindi ako naniniwala na kayo ni Achilles.""

¬†

Her wary eves remained on me

¬†

""He cut the cords with you for me. You were his friend before I came into his life.

¬†

And for him to burn the bridges for me... means he didn't value you.""

¬†

Kita ko ang saglit na pagbabago ng ekspresyon niya. I can sense that she was offended but I didn't stop there.

¬†

""Hindi ko alam kung anong namamagitan sa inyong dalawa. Kung.."" | shrugged confidently.

¬†

""Ginagamit ka ba niya para tigilan ko siya... o nagkamali siya at dahil sa prinsipyo niya, gusto niyang parusahan ang sarili at pagdusahan ang pagkakamali... pero isa lang ang alam ko.""

¬†

I paused to check on her expression and then smiled when I realized she looked angry.

¬†

""Hindi ka niya mahal.""

¬†

""Bakit mo sinasabi sa akin 'to?"" she said in a calm way.

¬†

I smiled more. ""Because if you are a decent woman, then you won't accept a man's pity commitment. I won't call it pity love cuz he won't love you... even if you're pitiful.""

¬†

Kumunot ang noo niya at ramdam ko ang pagpipigil.

¬†

""Commitment is a heavy word but Achilles is that kind of man. He can commit to something, kahit gaano niya pa ka ayaw, para lang sa prinsipyo niya. Kaya nasisiguro kong kahit ayaw na ayaw niya sa'yo... at mahal na mahal niya ako... kayang kaya niyang mag commit sa'yo para lang sundin ko ang mga magulang ko.""

¬†

""Kung may problema ka kay Achilles, kayong dalawa ang mag-usap. Huwag n'yo akong isali.""

¬†

I chuckled. ""Hindi ka naman talaga kasali.""

¬†

""Kung gano'n, ba't mo pa ako pinuntahan dito?""

¬†

""Kasi baka lang nagsisimula ka nang mag ilusyon dahil lang sa nangyari.""

¬†

""Kung nag ilusyon ako, big deal ba 'yon sa'yo? Takot ka ba na umaasa ako at tuluyang tuparin ni Achilles ang mga inaasahan ko?""

¬†

Napawi ang ngiti ko dahil sa mga sinabi ni Alana

¬†

""I'm not scared,"" I lied because I am.

¬†

Why else would I be here if I wasn't.

¬†

""Cuz... even if he actually commits to you, I know... you will never replace me.""

¬†

Siya naman ngayon ang natahimik at mukhang natakot.

¬†

""You will live under my shadows. He will be a boyfriend to you, but he will never love you the way he loves me. Not even close. And each time he will kiss you... he will close his eyes and think of me,"" marahan kong sinabi ang bawat kataga.

¬†

Ramdam ko ang panginginig ni Alana.

¬†

""And you will always wonder why you could never soothe him... it's because I am the only one who could. So in the end, you can't do anything for him. You will always fall short of what he wants. You will never be happy because you know it... deep in your heart... that you're not who he wants. And it will hurt more because you know he isn't happy, too.""

¬†

Napakurap-kurap si Alana bago nag-iwas ng tingin sa akin.

¬†

\*Hindi ko maintindihan kung bakit mo sinasabi sa akin ang lahat ng 'to.""

¬†

""Kayo na ba?"" sabi ko, inignora ang sinabi niya

¬†

Tumayo siya at lumakad kung saan. Sinundan ko siya ng tingin. Nakita kong dumiretso siya sa dispenser at kumuha ng tasa.

¬†

1 gritted my teeth. I am annoyed that she isn't affected. Or if she is, she didn't show it. Nagtimpa lang ng kape habang tinatalikuran ako kaharap ang dispenser. I saw how she touched her cellphone for a while while waiting for her coffee to fill.

¬†

""Kung gusto mong malaman ang mga detalye, si Achilles ang kausapin mo-""

¬†

""Well, he isn't here obviously. Kaya ikaw ang tinatanong ko.""

¬†

Binalingan niya ako habang hawak ang kanyang kape. Hindi pa rin siya sumagot.

¬†

""Is this the life you want? Be a teacher in a small town, your hometown?""

¬†

Dumilim ang tingin niya sa akin.

¬†

""Honestly, I thought you can do better than this. You're a prized lady here in Costa Leona... their standards.. but being with Achilles now means you're settling for a man who can't give you his all.""

¬†

Ramdam ko ang iritasyon niya sa buntonghiningang pinakawalan.

¬†

""Hindi ko alam kung para saan 'tong mga sinasabi mo. Kung gusto mo bang umalis ako at iwan si Achilles para mangyari kayong dalawa o...

¬†

Tumayo ako at ngumiti.

¬†

""Hindi naman sa ganoon, Alana..."" | said cheerily. ""But if you value yourself, I don't think you will really stay with him when you know he can never give you the attention you deserve.""

¬†

Sumeryoso ang mukha niya. Bumagsak saglit ang tingin ko sa kape na tinitimpla niva.

¬†

""If he indeed commits to you... at magkatuluyan kayo... kawawa ka naman..."" | played with my voice. ""Lagi kana lang naghihintay sa tira tira niyang atensiyon.""

¬†

Humigpit ang hawak niya sa tasa.

¬†

""Ikaw, teacher dito sa maliit na barrio'ng 'to. Naghihintay lang sa pagbaba ni Achilles sa barko. Hanggang diyan lang. Hindi man lang nakapag explore sa mundo. Dati kang beauty queen dito... everyone had high hopes for you... but no... you're a disappointment. You settled for a lifetime of waiting.""

¬†

1 chuckled.

¬†

""And everytime he goes back to your house. Yes. Your house. Cuz he will never be home. He will always be dreaming of the comfort of his home... and that's me. But he will also settle... in your poor and sad house. Settle for a sad life with you just so that his love's life would not be ruined.""

¬†

I clapped sarcastically.

¬†

""Congratulations for being a martyr. You literally wasted your whole life trying to please him, even when you could've been with another man who can love you.

¬†

Pero hindi, eh. Siyempre... pinili mo si Achilles na mahal na mahal mo. Kayang kaya mong sayangin ang buhay mo, para sa kanya... kahit tira tirang pag ibig niya na lang, 'di ba?""

¬†

I saw it coming. I saw how she angled her coffee towards me. Kaya nang ibuhos niya sana sa akin ion, nahuli ko ang kamay niya at imbes ay sa kanya bumuhos iyon.

¬†

Ngumisi ako lalo.

¬†

""Masakit ba, Alana? Kaya ba bubuhusan mo ako ng mainit na kape? Kasi... mainit din ang mga sinabi ko?"" | smiled wider. ""Nakakapaso, 'di ba?""

¬†

Alana looked miserable. Her face and uniform is covered with coffee. Ininda niya rin ang init ng kapeng sa akin dapat tumama!

¬†

""Don't play the rude bitch game with me, because I'm the rude bitch here,"" I said softly.

¬†

""Anong nangyayari dito?!"" Achilles' voice boomed.

¬†

Nanlaki ang mga mata ko. Hindi ko alam kung nasa Costa Leona ba siya o wala.

¬†

Akala ko wala. Akala ko sumampa na sa barko. Pero ngayon, nandito siya.

¬†

Dumalo agad kay Alana at naka uniporme pa!

¬†

""Anong ginawa mo?!"" He shouted and looked at me.

¬†

My voice got stuck. I didn't expect to see him. Pumunta lang talaga ako dito para kay Alana.

¬†

Napakurap-kurap ako. My heart pounded.

¬†

""Ano'ng ginawa ko?! She tried to pour the hot coffee to me! Naabutan ko kaya-""

¬†

""Tigilan mo na kami!"" he cut me off as if my explanation didn't matter to him.

¬†

My heart just got stabbed again. Naghihingalo na nga ito, parati pang nasasaksak.

¬†

""Pumunta ka pa talaga dito para manggulo! Lumayas ka dito sa Costa Leona at bumalik kana sa Maynila!"" he shouted angrily.

¬†

""We have properties here.""

¬†

""I will call the police and make them escort you out of this place, Marem! Don't try me!"" sigaw ni Achilles sa akin.

¬†

""Why should I be escorted out.""

¬†

""You are harassing Alana!""

¬†

Namilog lalo ang mga mata ko.

¬†

""I am harassing Alana?! She tried to pour the hot coffee on me! Ako ang mapapaso at mabubuhusan no'ng kape! Sinangga ko lang kaya 'ayan at siya ang natapunan! She harassed me, Achilles!""

¬†

Achilles then walked away while his phone is on his ear. Nagpupunas si Alana sa damit niya. Iniwan ko rin siya para sundan si Achilles.

¬†

""Achilles!"" tawag ko habang sumusunod sa kanya. ""It's not my fault! It only looks like it but-""

¬†

I stopped to pull his arm. Nasa gitna siya ng tawag. Lalo siyang nairita nang mukhang nasira pa ang tawag dahil lang hinigit ko ang braso niya.

¬†

""Tumigil kanga, Maria Emilia!""

¬†

""Hindi ako ang may kasalanan.""

¬†

""Wala akong pakialam!"" he slammed.

¬†

Natigilan ako. Naalala ko ang huli naming mga pagtatalo. I refuse to think that this will be another part of that fight. Kaya imbes na magmakaawa, kinalma ko ang sarili ko... at unti-unti akong ngumiti sa kanya.

¬†

""Bakit? Kayo ba?""

¬†

Kumunot ang noo niya. Nagulat din siguro siya sa kalmado kong disposisyon at sa ngiti.

¬†

""Hindi ka makasagot. Kayo ba?""

¬†

Bakit nga ba hindi niya ako nasasagot sa mga tanong ko. Kung talagang gusto niyang umalis ako, dapat diniretso niya ang mga dahilan niya.

¬†

""Hindi?""

¬†

""It's none of your business.""

¬†

""Mahal mo ba siya?""

¬†

""Shut up-""

¬†

""Hindi mo na ba ako mahal?"" | said and I smiled sweetly.

¬†

""I'm not playing this game with you.""

¬†

""Oh, ba't 'di mo maamin? Oo nga pala... may prinsipyo ka. Ayaw mag sinungaling.

¬†

Hindi mo kayang sabihin na hindi mo na ako mahal kasi ang totoo... mahal na mahal mo pa ako-""

¬†

""I said shut the fuck up, Maria Emilia!"" he snapped.

¬†

I didn't even flinch at his shout. Inasahan ko na iyon. Na sanay na ako.

¬†

""Oo! Kami na! Kaya umalis ka na! Tang ina!""

¬†

My eyes widened a fraction.

¬†

""Bakit? Siya na ang mahal mo?!"" | slightly lost my cool because of his answer.

¬†

""Fuck! Just leave!""

¬†

""Just answer, Achilles! Mahal mo si Alana? Hindi mo na ako mahal?""

¬†

Nagdilim ang titig niya sa akin. Lalo akong ngumisi dahil hindi siya sumasagot.

¬†

""Ang hirap magsinungaling, 'di ba? Kasi ang totoo, mahal mo ako-""

¬†

""Why the fuck are you forcing yourself on me? Hindi ba sinabi ko na na ayaw ko?""

¬†

""Because I know you're lying. Obviously. I'm your first and only girlfriend, Achilles. We have been in a relationship for years and I know you!"" | said confidently.

¬†

Kitang-kita ko ang hirap sa itsura ni Achilles. It seems like he didn't know what else to do with me.

¬†

It felt like a win. Kaya hindi na ako nag-aksaya ng panahon.

¬†

1 showed my hand with the engagement ring he gave me.

¬†

""You put a ring on my finger, you know. Samantalang ang babaeng 'yan, ang tagal mo nang kilala ni hindi mo niligawan. You are just pretending that you two are a thing to get rid of me, am I right?""

¬†

I am so sure it's the only reason why he is associating himself with Alana.

¬†

""Ginagamit mo lang siya. Well, I know you don't do that kind of stuff but-""

¬†

""Shut up.."" Achilles said coldly

¬†

Ramdam ko ang panghihina sa tono niya pa lang. Mukhang sawang sawa na siya. Lalo akong ngumiti. Sumuko ka na kasi.

¬†

""You can't fool the love of your life, Achilles-""

¬†

"" said shut up, Maria Emilia,"" his voice is seething with anger.

¬†

""Give it up-""

¬†

""Yes, I am marrying Alana. Now, would you shut the fuck up and leave.""

¬†

Gusto kong matawa. Surely, he is lying again. Umuwi ako rito ng mas matibay.

¬†

Hindi na nagpapadala sa emosyon at mas kontrolado ang nararamdaman.

¬†

O 'yon ang akala ko.

¬†

Dahil nang narinig ko ang sinabi ni Achilles, tuluyan nang nawala ang determinason at tiwala ko sa sarili... at sa kanya.

¬†

Did he really say that?

¬†

I hated how my tears formed behind my eyes. I had to stop it. I know know that they will continue to fall if I bottle it up so...

¬†

""Bakit?"" I said with equal coldness. ""Did you fuck her while we were apart?""

¬†

""Shut up!!!"" he shouted.

¬†

""Walang ibang rason na iwan mo ako para sa babaeng hindi mo mahal. Kilala kita. So you fucked her...'

¬†

Achilles bowed. Hindi ko alam kung guilty ba siya o suko na siya sa pakikipagtalo sa akin.

¬†

""You cheated on me, is that it? Ano? Magkasama na kayo sa isang bahay? Huh?""

¬†

Unti-unting bumagsak ang mga luha ko kahit kalmado naman ang tono ko.

¬†

I ignored all the signs because I had faith for him and our relationship. Noong una pa lang, naiisip ko na naman talaga 'to pero madali talagang baliwalain kasi kilalang kilala ko siya.

¬†

But now that he actually said it... I realized that it is a possibility. Achilles is a man of principle.

¬†

Kung totoo nga'ng... nagkamali siya at may nangyari sa kanila... he will take the responsibility.

¬†

What is it? Did he think he doesn't deserve me anymore because something happened between them? Kaya ba... kahit matanggap siya ng pamilya ko... hindi pa rin kami mangyayari?

¬†

Or... maybe he has... impregnated her?

¬†

My eyes widened at my thoughts. Nanging ang buong katawan ko at hindi ako makagalaw.

¬†

If it's the former, would I still accept him despite the mistake? And if it's the latter, would I forgive him and encourage him to marry me instead... despite... an unborn child?!

¬†

""You cheated on me?!"" That was the loudest scream I ever had my entire life.

¬†

""Please take her, Remus,"" kalmadong sinabi ni Achilles Page 693 of 1196

¬†

Hindi ko alam kung ano ang pinagsasabi niya. All I think about are the words I am going to pour right now. Kahit ang mga nakatingin sa pagtatalo namin sa paaralan, hindi ko na ininda. At halos kalmutin ko si Kuya nang hawakan niya ako para pigilan sa mga sigaw ko.

¬†

""You cheated on me?! Kaya mo pananagutan ang babaeng 'yan?! You cheated?!

¬†

Ano?! We're you drunk?! Did you think about me while you were doing it?!""

¬†

""Marem!"" sigaw ni Kuya sa likod ko habang hinahatak ako palayo sa kay Achilles.

¬†

Achilles looked away as our distance stretched. Hindi panga lang ako tapos ""You're bluffing! You won't marry her! Hindi mo kaya 'yon!""

¬†

""Let's go, Marem,"" si Kuya ulit.

¬†

""And if you will, you know you will never be happy! You really think you can be happy?! You really think she will be happy? Hindi! Dahil hinding hindi mo siya kayang mahalin gaya sa pagmamahal mo sa akin, Achilles! You will... never! Be satisdied with Alana!!!""

¬†

""That's enough, Maria Emilia!"" sigaw ni Kuya sa akin.

¬†

1 pulled my arm out of my brother's hold. I successfully did it.

¬†

""You will have a cursed life!"" I screamed at Achilles. ""You will never be happy!""

¬†

My rage felt like an untamed vicious animal inside of me. Hindi ko na kayang pigilan ang sarili ko kahit sa anong paraan. Kahit para sa kahihiyan na lang sana na pinapanood kami ng madaming tao. O kahit sa awa na lang sana sa sarili... hindi... wala na. Wala na akong pakialam.

¬†

""Kailan naman ang kasal n'yo?! I bet you all my money you can't do it! Can you really look into her eyes and exchange your I dos?! No! You can't! You will be disgusted that you're marrying someone who's not me!""

¬†

Achilles turned and slowly walked away. My rage only worsened.

¬†

""Your life is ruined!"" | shouted while my tears stream down my face. ""You entered the academy for me! You dreamed a better life for me! You don't deserve any of it now that you're without me!""

¬†

""Marem...

¬†

""I will ruin your wedding! Tandaan n'yo 'yan! I will be there and I won't pretend to wish you the best because I wish you hell! I wish you suffering! I wish you sadness all your life. I wish you deep and rotting regret, Achilles!!!""

¬†

Achilles stopped from his tracks. Hindi ko na alam kung naapektuhan ba siya sa sinabi ko o ano pero sa sobrang galit ko... wala na akong pakialam.

¬†

""I don't just wish people suffering.""

¬†

I am losing it.

¬†

""I make them suffer.""

¬†

1 paused as I watch his back on me. He is. Turning his back on me. Right now.

¬†

And maybe forever.

¬†

""I will make you suffer. I will make her suffer. I will make everything you care for suffer. Your name... your career... your wife... your children.""

¬†

Did you ever feel so angry that you are suddenly at peace?

¬†

""You will suffer until you regret, Achilles. That is my promise,"" I said coldly.

I'm a 29-year-old woman based in Delhi, walking into 30 with clarity, a bit of (read: so much) dread, and mostly curiosity about how this new decade will shape me. (Or undo me. Either way, we move.)

I'm childfree by choice since I was a child. My partner should also be childree, but can be a recent convert, I am not too rigid.
I believe in building a life filled with music, movies, slow mornings, filter coffee, long conversations, and libraries all of which is difficult with a screaming child and a crying partner.
I love babies and (some) kids but as the wise have said: bacche dusro ke hi acche.

Here‚Äôs what I do want:
‚óè Someone who is emotionally available and has empathy. Empathy is sexy.

‚óè Someone secure in themselves and not intimidated by a woman who overthinks a little, and is unafraid of respectful, open communication.

‚óè Someone who values growth but doesn‚Äôt use that word as an aesthetic without doing the actual work (therapy > manifesting).

‚óè A sense of humor about life. Cause sometimes life sucks, and all you can do is find some humor in the pain.

‚óè A partner in joy and in quiet, a music jam one night, a silent breakfast with books the next.

‚óè Have flaws like every other human being but believe that you deserve love not because you are perfect but inspite of the fact you are not. 

When I was younger, I had a long list of boxes to check: must play an instrument, must have read Camus, must look like a poet, must this, must that. But I‚Äôve learned that shared interests can be cultivated. What can‚Äôt be cultivated is character and Kindness is the one box that matters the most to me.

So who I am? I‚Äôm someone who:

‚óè Is deeply curious so knows far too much about Greek mythology than is normal (thanks to a teenage phase)

‚óè Loves the ocean enough to get it tattooed. Yes, I am that basic. The sea calls to me. I am a tad dramatic, I blame Jane Austen. I cried while watching the Blue Planet documentary.

‚óè Is responsible but impulsive, loves spontaneous trips, and has a thing for tiny live gigs.

‚óè Can and will sprout random facts (neutron stars can spin 700 times a second). I‚Äôve always loved space, both the NASA kind and the space to grow kind. Studied quantum mechanics in my Master‚Äôs, but now I am in corporate and explain excel pivots to executives. Life is wild.

‚óè Has a thousand hobbies, abandons one, picks up three more. Is clumsy, there will always be a mysterious bruise or two, and I‚Äôll absolutely walk into furniture while arguing and keep arguing any way.

‚óè Will definitely forget where the keys are and never expect me to remember asking for free dhaniya (my friends' sweet (not really) nickname for me means scatterbrained), but I won‚Äôt forget the color of your childhood bedroom or your favorite icecream flavor.

‚óè You‚Äôll never catch me without headphones. I live for rock, indie, blues, and yes, Bollywood bangers for the 2 am dance routines.

‚óè If I see a cat, I absolutely don't care where I am, I have to stop and do pspspspsps. It's the cat tax. A cat choosing you is the highest compliment you can receive.

‚óè Is non-religious, trying to find what or who I believe in.

‚óè Loves deeply and truly, and has crossed oceans for the people I love but only when I feel emotionally safe and seen. 

What I am looking for: A serious relationship where if I cook, you do the dishes.

If this seems your Jam, drop in my dms or comment. 
And if not, I hope you find what you‚Äôre looking for too. ‚ú®

I told him I'm not looking to find a relationship when the topic arose.

He asked for my number and, since we had a good time talking, I gave it to him. I guess I should not have done that, because I'm not romantically interested in him nor do I have the time and space in my life for another person. As it is, I have barely enough time for my friends and family, let alone another new acquaintance.

Now he asked to meet up several times which I declined, as I didn't have time. Last time he asked again, I asked him if this was supposed to be a date to which he replied, he wouldn't mind that. 

I told him that I'm a) not interested in a relationship and b) lesbian and he said that'd be fine, we could still hang out. So now we're going to meet for a coffee today. 

Here's where I feel like I should call it off: There was a thunderstorm last night and this guy I barely know and barely text (the very manageable amount of text was about if and where we could meet up) texts me late at night if I'm alright, since the thunderstorm is so bad.

I feel like he's massively overstepping here. We don't date. I made it clear that I don't want to date him. And now his worries make him text me at 2 AM if I'm ok with the thunderstorm?! We met once, accidentally, on a train.

I kinda feel bad for him but I seriously want to call the whole coffee deal off because I don't want to fuel this... Whatever it is. Am I overreacting?",2,1749975550.0,AmIOverreacting,1,0.75,False

First day took 10 g of soluble coffee at 6 am

Extreme androgenic effects ,I literally went out to pick up girls ,I never had so high libido before 
I felt an increase in insuline sensivity 
Then the negative side : extremely depressed after 12 am ,I didn't drink enough water and didn't take magnesium.

Next day I took only 2 g 
Less androgenic effects not enough noticeable energy 
Still depressed after .
Third day I drank enough water and took magnesium and I didn't felt so depressed but still my mood was hanging.

Today I came back to monster 
My mood noticeable increased I'm feeling happier ,but no any other effects like the coffee .

So what I've learned ,black coffee is better if you pair it with exercise the masculine energy you get is insane, if I had to say what a steroid does coffee did that for me first day .I would definitely try again the 10 g dose .

TL/DR sleep deprived rant

I remember my first being a crap sleeper once the 4 month sleep regression started... He never even tried to self soothe, and woke every 45-90minutes for weeks and weeks. It got better over months to 1 wake up a night, but then progressed to that wake up being hours long until me and my partner (and baby tbh) were so delieriously tired that we sleep trained at 10 months or so. We had literally exhausted everything up to that point and I was so tired I was actually hallucinating. Prior to the regression he slept 8-9pm until 6am from about 6 weeks old - I was smug, until I wasn't.

So when my second was born and she started sucking her hands to sleep and attempting independent sleep I thought I'd won the jackpot. Newborn sleep wasn't as good as my firstborn, but we'd always get a 6-7hr stretch in, before a night feed and then she would sleep another 2-3 hours. 3 weeks ago she started adding an additional night wake, not too bad as we were still getting an initial 4-5 hour stretch. Then that stretch became 3-4 hours... And now it's 2 hours, all blasted night long, things seem to be getting worse and not better. 

In addition to this my first was up in the night last nighttwice, so I was woken up 6 times. 

It feels like torture. She fought bedtime tooth and nail until after 9pm, by which point she had been awake for 3.5 hours and was overtired. I hadn't eaten, so ate, tidied up food (partner took care of all the other toddler toys, sorted out the dog) and went to bed, prior to 10pm. I got an hour before being woken, and then it was every 2 hours, plus the times our 3 year old was wandering. Today I have what I think is a clogged duct, and it feels like someone has punched me in the breast, I'm tearful and I feel like a can't function. I feel like picking a fight with my partner, but it's not his fault and he is beyond tired too. But despite all this I have a smile plastered on my face because it's father's day and we're going to meet my parents for coffee and cake.

Time and hormones truly make you forget what chronic sleep deprivation feels like...

Y‚Äôall.

I thought dark chocolate was supposed to be bitter and scary. This? This was smooth, a little fruity, kind of smoky? I took a bite and suddenly felt like I should be discussing flavor notes and taxes.

I ended up buying a small bar (for the price of what felt like half a grocery run), brought it home, and ate it slowly like I was doing a tasting flight. I even paired it with black coffee like some kind of fancy adult.

Have I been missing out on my whole life? What is this flavor complexity? Why did no one tell me dark chocolate could be this good?
