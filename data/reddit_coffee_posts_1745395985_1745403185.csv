Hi,
I hate that making great espresso can be quite wasteful sometimes if you struggle dialing in. I recently bought a coffee pod to make turkish coffee after a holiday trip and I think it could be a nice addition to the espresso setup to help reduce wasted coffee grounds. 
Basically instead of throwing away the grounds that are unfit for espresso you just add them to a container that is used tl make turkish coffee. Even if I know that turkish coffee requires grounds that are even finer I dont think that adding some espresso grojnds will make much of a difference.
What do you think?",1,1745403079.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Welcome to my Page!

First off, fuck what you've heard about me and what you think you know. This is the internet, so unless you've met me personally, you know only what you read here. I'm Sin. More people call me that than the name I was given, though very recently I changed that by legally changing my name to Charlie. I am who I am. I'm obsessive. I over think and overanalyze everything. I'm an all or nothing kind of person. I'm a walking contradiction, an anomaly in a society consumed by bigots and selfish assholes. I have a big heart and too many good intentions. I'm blunt and straight forward, and for that I often get myself in trouble. It is because of this that I don't have many friends, but instead have many acquaintances. I'm a professional photographer, and I model. I love my cats and my rodents. I consider them better company than most people. I have many scars, tattoos and piercings. I wouldn't trade any of them for anything. They're a part of me and make me who I am.

~I'm a professional photographer and graphic designer.
~I model professionally, though it is more of a hobby.
~I have two degrees, one in English (with a concentration in Ancient Literature through the Renaissance) and one in Studio Art (with a concentration in portraiture).
~I draw, portraits mostly, but I can draw just about anything.
~I like to write, though I don't write as much as I used to.
~My favorite villain is Cruella de Vil.
~I'm mostly Sicilian.
~I am obsessed with bunny rabbits. I collect a new stuffed rabbit every year.
~I collect dictionaries and thesauruses.
~I'm a logolept. Words are what I live for.
~I'm submissive, masochistic and a misanthropist.


Likes

~I love animals and am VERY against animal cruelty.
~I love wearing corsets.
~I love rocking out in mosh pits at shows.
~I love to lounge in graveyards against the oldest tombstones. It makes me feel closer to the person that died and was buried there.
~I'm obsessed with the TMNT. Raphael is my favorite turtle.

Dislikes
~I really can't stand when people just comment with a hey or you're hot. Put some effort into it if you want me to say hi!
~I make signs for people ONLY when I want to. Don't inbox/comment me asking to make you a sign please.
~Bad grammar is a pet peeve. If you can't spell and are a native English speaker, don't talk to me.
~I don't like being accused of being fake. I'm real, hence the salute.
~I DESPISE when people message me just to hit on me or talk dirty to me.
~If you're going to be rude to me on this site (or any other for that matter), then go fuck yourself. I don't tolerate rude behavior; it is absolutely uncalled for.
~I don't like to argue, and I don't support violence or violent acts. Don't expect me to fight.
~People who claim to be photographers or models, who CLEARLY aren't.
~People who can't take the time to read my profile before contacting me. If you can't take the time to read my profile, then I simply cannot take the time to respond to you.

1k5vhe6,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1k5vhe6/im_running_out_of_steam_with_being_the_adult_for/,I’m running out of steam with being the adult for two people,"
Super long, apologies mobile users. Firstly - I love my boyfriend and we work through things but I’m exhausted and need to let some things out without worrying about tone or him feeling attacked and have some advice on going forward.

This might just be a rant, I don’t even know how justified I am and I know there are two sides to everything so please know this is my biased side after feeling so tired and being a bit hurt. I feel guilty even typing this out but I think I might be getting myself into hot water. I (F25) and my boyfriend (M23) have been together for almost a year. We lived at opposite ends of the country so I drove every couple of weeks 7 hours each way to visit. He has a very good and stable job and we decided since I didn’t have anything to stay for (living with family whilst I settled back from travelling) that I would move down to him and we would move in together, which we are doing in two weeks but currently staying with his parents and have done for two months as I got a job down here.

The last couple of months have been tough on us, I was really struggling when I moved down and found out I was pregnant, I knew I would need to have an abortion but it turned into a complicated miscarriage and three weeks ago I was haemorrhaging in A&E (he was absolutely fantastic in the hospital).

Honestly though the pregnancy and miscarriage made me really tricky to be around and probably almost broke us. I’m still exhausted, I lost a lot of blood and had an unpaid week off work, I didn’t have a lot of savings, my car gave out last week due to wear and it’s going to be a lot to fix it, so it’s all taken it’s toll along with the trauma. 

I’ve got no friends here really, and haven’t had the energy or time because I rushed to get a kind of crappy job so I could move here. I didn’t have any where I moved from because it was a stop gap but I stayed in the country when the relationship started. I’m artistic and creative but the area is proving to be pretty expensive and honestly, boring. I wanted to start some martial arts but got a lot of pushback and he suggested pilates instead and we went back and forth until he backed down. He gets upset I haven’t done more but I’ve been so tired and tried so hard to get involved with his family, his club, work.

I’ve got really into my boyfriends hobby so we can spend time together, which takes up most weekends and week nights and he is always on his phone or thinking of. But it isn’t my hobby and I feel a bit lost now.

I love travel but agreed to settle for a couple of years here whilst we built up savings to go somewhere else to work together, I was really nervous about this but he has assured me we will go. If we weren’t together I’d probably be away doing that - I stayed where I was for a year for the sake of our relationship.  

Because of this and feeling so unsettled now and exhausted, I’m wondering if I’m overreacting to some issues which are bothering me. He’s really always praised my emotional intelligence but it’s felt to a point like teaching a child to be reasonable with emotions, he’s an only son and sometimes feels like he’s quite short sighted. 

I’m typing this after we agreed we would have a fun chat about going away for a few days over my birthday soon, but he downloaded a playstation game of his hobby and sat next to me in silence for nearly two hours instead. I cooked dinner for him and his family tonight, which he never does and occasionally has put together some ready meals for us but he’s more eat out kinda guy, and it’s really just put a downer on me. Earlier we all were cleaning the new house this afternoon and I scrubbed the bathroom top to bottom whilst he dusted the blinds (there are 4/5 windows).

I’d had to rush from work because he told me his Mum wanted to go early and was really stressed, it felt off and I asked if actually he had requested we go early so he had time for his hobby, he said no… then changed to yes a few minutes later because he said he “didn’t want to be told off”. He knows I worry about upsetting his Mum and the little lies bother me and they happen quite a bit but he just grinned and laughed.

He also is really forgetful, plans, things he said he’d do, needs pushed to do almost all chores, won’t do laundry by himself, needs reminded to shower even when he got a sweat rash, pushes back at me nagging him to, complained about his body but wouldn’t go to the gym and when I encouraged then honestly just pushed he got annoyed, won’t unload the dishwasher unless he needs to to load it. He doesn’t walk his own family dog because he’s slow so his parents ask me to do it even though we both work from home quite a lot. 

He’s had a very intense and overbearing Mum and I think this has meant he pushes back on things like this he doesn’t chose to do himself and I’m really hopeful and he’s very assuring this will change when we move in a couple of weeks but it’s getting tiring. He said he would quit fun smoking also, but he found a fun smoking vape the same day he ran out of “stuff” and uses that every day. It’s not overwhelming but he knows I don’t love it and promised he would stop and it would be a fail safe and not habitual but it’s every day… and when I call him out he either gets annoyed or laughs it off. 

He get’s angry, we both do in arguments, but says quite hurtful things he doesn’t mean and then expects to go away, I trained myself to not do this but if we disagree and my tone is “rude”, even though I think often it pales in comparison and is hustling trying to match his level of assertiveness he calls me out. He is incredibly defensive so the point of getting upset with me and my tone when I am panicking immediately after he “forgot” to consider I was very sensitive around being intimate post-miscarriage and hurt me accidentally in a way that triggered flashbacks by being too hard. 

Again, his parents are very intense, and has said he is going to go to therapy. He then says he’s a terrible boyfriend out of the blue, and I remind him this is something he hates his Mum saying which he brushes off. He says I always twist things and he’s always apologising… Honestly he apologises quite a bit, but not from nowhere also he forgets a lot, can be really hurtful and quite self-centred and this has been tough with everything over the past few months. 

I really love him, I love his drive and passion and kindness towards people and he’s so personable. My family loves him. He’s also really complimentary, never given me any reasons to be jealous, talks really highly of me to others and is very generous with his money because he earns a decent bit more and likes buying things. But this is also proving a bit tricky to navigate right now as we can’t even commit time to discuss how this will work other than “60/40” when we move in. We went round to our new house the other day to get measurements and I was doing that and found him just sat on his phone on the sofa and had to ask him to help. If I don’t push for a discussion it just won’t happen, and this goes for a few things.

He keeps bringing up that he’s going to propose this year and we’ll never break up because we work through everything and we do! But it can be really draining sometimes and has been on top of everything since I’ve moved down as I feel like I explain EVERYTHING and he just goes Ohhhh right. It sounds so silly but today I was stressed sorting out work and finances and my car and he came to tell me that he wanted me to know he didn’t care about going away and he was being easy going to not stress me out but I wish he would have just offered to help or made some suggestions because now it’s on my never ending list of things to bring up or else they won’t happen, he says I’m indecisive about things and likes when I just say what I want but I’m so tired. 

When our relationship started I liked that he was quite masculine and took a level of charge, I’ve been hyper-independent(traumatic childhood) my whole life and liked this outlook and his commitment to us (brought up marriage and seriousness of our relationship very early). But unless there is a crisis, which he excels in, this has kind of disappeared. 

I swore I wouldn’t do the teaching a man how to communicate his feelings thing, or plan my own dates or have to ask to buy flowers or ask for him  to ask me if I would like a coffee when he makes one but I feel a bit back here. 

I’m now panicking a little but frankly I could just need a rant, some trauma therapy for last couple of months and some time, especially for us to have our own place because I know that will ease him up significantly. I know I’m biased and I sure bring my share of argumentativeness and stubbornness, we’re both very strong willed and like to be right and we’re working on it. I really do feel like when we try we get through anything but I’m on my knees a little now.

My life feels like it is slipping before me and I have lost connection to myself and desires. Everything feels so unattainable right now. Like I am in some limbo. I am just listening to Godspeed You! Black Emperor as I walk through the darkness. It feels like a backdrop. I have the urge to walk to outside my ex's accommodation and stand there for a bit. It is probably a bad idea to follow through on. I just had this life. And even if it was painful it meant something. And now it's all gone. Yet I am still chained to the institution where it all happened. A nail bar is still open. Just to test fate I want to walk in and talk to the girl in there, for no reason at all. And I don't do it, for some fleeting reason I don't know of either. I can’t help but watch people and wonder what is going on in their lives. An Asian lady in a Chinese takeaway shop still working at 21:59 PM. Maybe this is how she doesn't commit suicide. I am walking but walking into the arms of accepting my chains. The chains of a society that I hate that I am stuck in. I see a fox. I walk up to him and he runs away. I wonder what kind of terror he has nestled in his brain and what stories he would tell me if he wasn't experiencing that terror.

I also have fatty liver. Sometimes I have to drink low fat milk with Splenda after meals just to stop the cravings it’s insane. 

My mom made me a birthday cake and I took home the leftovers after we all had some; intended to donate to coffee hour at my building but ended up eating all the leftover cake plus some Easter candy within 48 hrs of taking it home with me. 

Last night I had TWO(!) boxes of Kraft Dinner with salted, buttered chicken thighs (boneless; ate the whole package) with the pasta for dinner. And I still managed to have watermelon with vanilla yogurt and an Asian buffalo wing and “zero” sugar mango punch. 

Everybody serves food wherever I go: board games with friends, support groups, poetry club, church, Mom’s house, everywhere. I can’t say no; no self control whatsoever. 

People make me feel bad or that I’m the odd man out when I want to eat healthy food that I bring just for me; if someone cooks a home cooked meal and I refuse it or just eat parts of it, people will make snarky comments —e.g., if I refuse bread at Mom’s Sunday dinner, my aunt who is always seated next to me will say, “O but you’ll have it for dessert”, referring to the times I might have a couple extra slices of bread directly from the bread basket after all the plates are cleared from dinner. 

If I bring my own separate meal she (my aunt) will say, with a sob in her voice, “You’re not going to eat OUR meal with US??” (Emphasis mine). It’s like I’m being looked upon as a prima donna intent on “othering” myself with my “special” food; that I’m distancing myself from the family and its love. Then in the same breath my aunt, let’s call her M, will say “you’re just gonna have some later (translation: you’ll just “feel deprived” and bing later) so you “might as well” eat what “the ‘in’ group” is eating now and (fall in line, basically). 

The irony is that M never eats a full meal or portion of dessert, or she pretends to then spits it all out as my family and I have seen. Then she will loudly proclaim “O I’m SO full! (To my dad) “you cooked a delicious meal (she ALWAYS says to my dad, “J, you’ve outdone yourself!” Every. F*n. Time. So phony and disingenuous, and frankly transparent to everyone. “O I’m SO full; let me waddle home” meanwhile she ate two bites and scraped the rest in the trash when she (conveniently) always does the dishes after. 

Everyone talks about how she looks too thin and unhealthy yet my mom will say to me, “next [week, at dinner] try to do what M does: put a ‘teeny tiny’ amount of food on your plate, eat slower than her, than stop midway and say ‘O I’m SO full’ and smoosh the rest [of the food on my plate] around so it looks like [I’ve] eaten it” 

WTAF!? 

So now I’m supposed to disingenuously ape the behaviors of someone with a DIFFERENT eating disorder just to “shut [M] up” as Mom so delicately puts it? 
 
SMH seriously. 

What do others do in [these] situation[s]?

nothing. i got coffee. i ran errands. i even got a “cute outfit” from the girl at the counter. and i felt... kinda powerful? like for once i wasn’t shrinking myself

I have generalized panic/anxiety disorder, kinda runs in my family. It's the whole reason I started self-medicating with alcohol 10 yrs ago. I'm on day 3 of my first genuine quit attempt.

I drank relatively low doses but at a very problematic frequency. Meaning 2-4 beers every day then 1-2 bottles of wine on the weekends as an average sized woman for 5 years, the 5 years before that it was ""only"" Friday-Sunday. Never enough to get me shitfaced, but just enough to relax / numb myself.

I'm used to anxiety, I have it almost every day. There are better and worse periods in my life. However since I'm so used to it, I've learned to manage it, and the past few years have been easier. 

But dear lord, yesterday (day 2) I had the worst panic attack I've had in 7 years maybe. Granted it was a host of problems, I have insulin resistance and barely had dinner because I'm so used to having beer for ""dinner"". Then I skipped breakfast and just had coffee and a smoke instead. All of this resulted in a sudden blood sugar crash that had my hands shaking uncontrollably and panic setting in. 

After that I felt on edge all day, and today is starting no different. My anxiety has always been more physiological than mental, and even now I feel like a live wire, in a bad way. I've gone a couple days without a drink before, but this quit attempt comes after a particularly long streak, after drinking every night this month.

🔗 [**LadyTrader X Space Recording**](https://x.com/kenduinu/status/1914363954844852314?s=46)

Okay, so massive shout out to u/barnickal for taking detailed notes of the most recent Kendu X Space! Also a huge shout out to [LadyTraderRA ](https://x.com/LadyTraderRa)for hosting this awesome X Space! I took his bullet-points and made it into this summary. It's a must listen, and after the latest updates from the April 21st community call, it’s honestly wild how far Kendu has come. If you're expecting another pump-and-dump meme token, you're not paying attention. Kendu is no longer a gamble. It’s a movement.

**From Dev Rug to Community Resurrection**

Let’s rewind for a second. Kendu should have been dead months ago. The original developer rugged 5% of the supply and bailed, right as the market was crashing and liquidity was being sucked into Trump-themed meme coins. That would have been the end for most projects. But not here. The community rallied, kicked the bad actor out, and kept building. Not only did Kendu survive, it started thriving.

**Kendu Games: AAA Dev Comes Out of Retirement**

This is the biggest news. [Coop](https://x.com/WhatDidCoopSay), a community member, is now launching a legitimate game studio under the $KENDU umbrella, named; Kendu Games. Not a half-baked crypto game or a easy cash-grab. A full-scale traditional RPG, with serious developers. The lead dev? A former triple AAA game developer and BioWare veteran who worked on Dragon Age, Mass Effect, and Baldur’s Gate. He literally came out of retirement for this, purely because he believes in what Kendu is doing. The plan is to create a Skyrim-style RPG, followed by a roguelite later. No crypto gimmicks in the gameplay. But the kicker is that game profits will be used to buy Kendu tokens and fund the community. Here's a small breakdown, from all the profits 10% will go into a Kendu Games Business treasury and 5% will be donated to the Kendu Community wallet. let's say they hit one million copies sold, which is likely to happen, that’s an estimated $1.6 million in buy pressure for Kendu. That’s just from one game.

[Kendu Games Teaser](https://reddit.com/link/1k5v8uz/video/21hs1llz3kwe1/player)

[Kendu Games X Profile](https://x.com/KenduGames)

**Decentralized Brand, Real-World Impact**

Kendu isn’t just building in digital spaces. The brand is exploding in the real world too. Members of the community have launched Kendu Coffee, Kendu Energy Drinks, Kendu Vodka, Kendu Nights (club promotions), and even Kendu Esports, a League of Legends team. What makes this different from every other project? It’s all permissionless. Anyone can build under the Kendu brand without needing to ask for approval. There is no centralized entity handing out licenses. This is decentralized brand ownership in action.

[Kendu Energy Promo Video](https://reddit.com/link/1k5v8uz/video/glalrqaf0kwe1/player)

**""We Don’t Gamble, We Work""**

This has become the core philosophy of Kendu. The project isn’t about flipping tokens or hoping for pumps. It’s about showing up and putting in the work. Token holders treat Kendu like a startup. There are daily goals, power hours, and people grinding social content and launching real-life products. The Kendu community is working, not speculating.

**No Paid Hype, No Insiders**

One of the most refreshing parts of Kendu is how it’s grown. There are no paid influencers, no whales with insider allocations, and no VC dumping risk. Everyone buys with their own money. Everyone contributes with their own effort. It’s raw, organic, and surprisingly effective. The project has reached over 18,000 holders this way. Not through hype, but through work.

**Wormhole Bridge: Building for the Long Game**

Kendu has also quietly launched bridges to the Solana and Base chains. This wasn’t a PR stunt or hype strategy. It was a tactical move, preparing for the moment when momentum returns. The goal is simple: dominate the top gainers list across multiple chains in the long term. This kind of forward-thinking infrastructure sets Kendu apart from typical meme coins. And the cool addition to this; let's say Solana moves up in price? This will automatically drive the price of $KENDU without any added buy pressure.

[$KENDU Available on 3 Chains](https://preview.redd.it/xsfz0acl0kwe1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b5d217c5cbde150aca3baaee6f54ef8e8d014b6)

**No Roadmap, Just Vision**

Kendu isn’t promising the moon on a whiteboard full of deadlines. There’s no traditional roadmap. Instead, the focus is on empowering the community to launch initiatives organically. A white paper is currently being written, but it’s meant to lay out a vision, not a list of promises. A grants program is also planned for the future, once the project hits a market cap between $50 million and $100 million. That funding will help support community-led ventures like festivals, shops, or new product lines.

**Different From Other Meme Coins**

Kendu isn’t trying to be the next dog-themed token or celebrity-endorsed project. It’s more serious than the average meme coin, more decentralized than celebrity tokens like TrumpCoin, and not botted, but entirely organically build, by REAL human beings. Kendu is trying to build something new, a culture-powered brand that can live in both crypto and the real world.

**The Builders Speak**

The people behind Kendu aren’t shy about what they’re building. Josh, one of the core community leads, says he’s never seen a project with this much promise. He points out that Kendu has matched the social output of projects 20 times its size. Kevin, another day-one supporter, compares the project’s vibe to Silicon Valley in the 80s, MTV culture in the 90s, and the early internet boom. It’s culture, investing, and creativity all rolled into one.

[Josh](https://x.com/JoshKendu): ''*I've never seen a project with so much promise before. Kendu should really be dead right now – but the community has kept it alive and actually growing. We frequently match the social output of projects 20x our size like MOG, PEPE, and SHIB. Kendu is insanely undervalued considering our output right now – and the morewe grow, the faster that output will scale.*''

[Kevin](https://x.com/_KEVINFINNERTY): ''*The stickiness of the community is what made my eyebrows raise from the start. You can't build to 18,000 holders from hype alone – it’s people working 24/7. In crypto, you can join a 'company' like Kendu and actually contribute to it, build with it, and own part of it. That’s never existed before. We are severely undervalued at $10m. We’re going to billions.*''

[Jeff ](https://x.com/LowQ_eth)(Co-Host): ''*KENDU is legit looking like the early days of SHIB but without the dev drama risk now. It’s more of a decentralised brand incubator than a meme coin at this point. If KENDU Games delivers even medium success, it could be absolutely massive for the tokenomics. Right now it's sitting at a tiny $10m market cap, massively undervalued compared to the ecosystem we’re building.*''

**TL;DR**

Kendu should’ve died after bad choices by the developer and a market crash. Instead, the community kicked into overdrive, launching real-world products, bridging to new chains, and now even building a AAA-style RPG with a retired BioWare dev. It’s not a meme coin anymore — it’s a decentralized brand, built by people who work, not gamble. And at just $10 million market cap, the whole thing still feels massively undervalued.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best decorated candles in 2025 stand out due to their unique designs, high-quality materials, and attention to detail. They aren鈥檛 just about fragrance; they are about creating an aesthetic experience.

**Wax Composition and Burn Time:** The type of wax used significantly impacts the candle's burn time, scent throw, and overall quality. Soy wax, beeswax, and paraffin wax are common choices, each with its own advantages. Soy wax is a popular eco-friendly option known for its clean burn and long-lasting scent. Beeswax candles produce a natural honey scent and purify the air. Paraffin wax is cost-effective but may produce more soot. The burn time typically ranges from 20 to 80 hours, depending on the candle size and wax type.

**Decorative Elements and Artistry:** The artistry in decorating a candle can vary widely, from intricate hand-painted designs to embedded natural elements like dried flowers or crystals. Some candles feature elaborate wax carvings or sculpted details. The quality of the decorative elements is crucial; they should be durable, non-toxic, and aesthetically pleasing. The best candles showcase a harmonious blend of visual appeal and functional design.

**Scent Profile and Intensity:** The fragrance of a candle is a critical aspect of its appeal. Top-quality decorated candles use essential oils or fragrance oils to create complex and captivating scent profiles. The scent intensity should be balanced, providing a pleasant aroma without being overpowering. Popular scent categories include floral, fruity, woody, spicy, and fresh, each evoking different moods and atmospheres.

**Container Material and Design:** The container holding the candle plays a vital role in its overall aesthetic and safety. Common materials include glass, ceramic, metal, and even wood. Glass containers are popular for their transparency and ability to showcase the candle's wax and decorative elements. Ceramic containers offer a range of colors and textures, while metal containers provide a sleek and modern look. The container should be heat-resistant and stable to prevent accidents.

**Wick Type and Placement:** The wick type and placement are essential for a clean and even burn. Cotton wicks are commonly used, but wooden wicks are gaining popularity for their crackling sound and wide flame. The wick should be properly sized for the candle's diameter to ensure it melts the wax evenly and prevents tunneling. Multiple wicks are often used in larger candles to distribute heat and fragrance more effectively.

**Packaging and Presentation:** The packaging of a decorated candle contributes to the overall gifting experience. High-quality candles often come in elegant boxes, adorned with ribbons, tags, or personalized messages. The packaging should protect the candle during shipping and storage while also enhancing its perceived value. Thoughtful packaging can elevate a simple candle into a luxurious and memorable gift.

 ## Core Benefits

Decorated candles provide numerous benefits beyond just illumination and fragrance. They enhance ambiance, offer relaxation, and serve as unique decorative accents.

**Enhanced Ambiance and Atmosphere:** Decorated candles can instantly transform the mood of a room, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The soft glow of the flame, combined with the captivating scent, promotes relaxation and tranquility. Whether used in a living room, bedroom, or bathroom, these candles add a touch of elegance and sophistication to any space.

**Stress Relief and Relaxation:** The flickering flame and soothing scents of decorated candles can help reduce stress and promote relaxation. Certain fragrances, such as lavender, chamomile, and sandalwood, have calming properties that can ease anxiety and improve sleep quality. Incorporating these candles into a bedtime routine or meditation practice can enhance overall well-being.

**Unique Decorative Accents:** Decorated candles serve as eye-catching decorative accents, adding personality and style to any room. Their intricate designs, vibrant colors, and artistic details make them stand out as focal points. They can be displayed on shelves, mantels, or coffee tables, complementing existing d茅cor and creating a cohesive aesthetic.

**Personalized Gifting Options:** Decorated candles make thoughtful and personalized gifts for any occasion. With a wide range of designs, scents, and packaging options available, it's easy to find a candle that perfectly matches the recipient's taste and preferences. Adding a personalized message or choosing a scent that evokes a special memory can make the gift even more meaningful.

**Aromatherapy and Wellness Benefits:** Many decorated candles are infused with essential oils that offer aromatherapy benefits. Certain scents can boost mood, enhance focus, or relieve headaches. For example, peppermint and eucalyptus can clear congestion, while citrus scents can uplift and energize. Using these candles can promote physical and emotional well-being.

 ## FAQs Section

Navigating the world of decorated candles can raise several questions. Here are some common inquiries to help inform your buying decisions.

**How do I choose the right scent for my space?**
Consider the size of the room and the desired atmosphere. Lighter, fresher scents like citrus or floral are suitable for smaller spaces, while bolder scents like woody or spicy are better for larger rooms. Also, think about the room's purpose; calming scents are ideal for bedrooms, while energizing scents are great for home offices.

**What is the best way to care for a decorated candle?**
Trim the wick to 录 inch before each use to prevent smoking and ensure an even burn. Allow the candle to burn for at least two hours on the first use to create a full melt pool. Avoid burning the candle for more than four hours at a time. Keep the candle away from drafts and flammable materials.

**Are decorated candles safe to use around children and pets?**
Yes, but with precautions. Always keep candles out of reach of children and pets. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Place the candle on a stable, heat-resistant surface. Consider using flameless LED candles as a safer alternative if you have concerns about open flames.

**How can I repurpose the container after the candle is finished?**
Clean the container thoroughly with hot, soapy water to remove any wax residue. You can then repurpose it as a decorative vase, storage jar, or desk organizer. Some containers can also be recycled, depending on the material.

# Best Candle Accessories 2025: Top Picks & Buying Guide

Candles offer a simple yet effective way to enhance the ambiance of any space, creating a relaxing and inviting atmosphere. However, to truly maximize their potential and ensure safety, candle accessories are essential. From extending the life of your favorite scents to preventing accidents, the right tools can significantly elevate your candle experience. This guide explores the best candle accessories of 2025, helping you choose the perfect additions to your collection.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best candle accessories combine functionality, durability, and aesthetic appeal. They are designed to enhance the candle burning experience while also complementing your home d茅cor. Below are some of the key features to consider when selecting your accessories.

**Candle Wick Trimmer:** A candle wick trimmer is designed to precisely trim the wick of your candle, typically to about 1/4 inch. This prevents smoking, sooting, and uneven burning, ensuring a cleaner and longer-lasting burn. The best trimmers are made from stainless steel for durability and feature a long handle to reach the bottom of deep jars.

The precision cut ensures the candle burns properly, optimizing the fragrance throw and minimizing carbon buildup. A well-trimmed wick reduces the risk of black soot forming on the glass jar or surrounding surfaces, maintaining a cleaner environment. This is a crucial tool for anyone serious about candle care.

**Candle Snuffer:** A candle snuffer provides a safe and smoke-free way to extinguish candles. Rather than blowing out the flame, which can scatter wax and create smoke, a snuffer deprives the flame of oxygen, causing it to gently extinguish. High-quality snuffers are typically made of metal, such as stainless steel or brass, and come in a variety of styles, from bell-shaped to scissor-style.

The bell snuffer works by placing it directly over the flame, while scissor snuffers allow you to cut off the oxygen supply with greater precision. Using a snuffer helps maintain the integrity of the fragrance and prevents hot wax from splattering, reducing the risk of burns or damage to your surroundings. It also eliminates the puff of smoke and lingering odor that often accompanies blowing out a candle.

**Candle Warmer Lamp:** Candle warmer lamps offer a flameless alternative to traditional burning. These lamps use a halogen bulb or heating element to melt the top layer of wax, releasing the fragrance without a flame. They are a safer option, especially for households with children or pets, and they can extend the life of your candle since the wax doesn't evaporate as quickly as it does with burning.

Adjustable lamps allow you to control the intensity of the heat, regulating the fragrance throw to your preference. Some models also feature timers or automatic shut-off functions for added convenience and safety. Candle warmer lamps come in various designs to complement any d茅cor, offering both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

**Decorative Candle Tray:** A decorative candle tray, often made of ceramic, metal, or wood, serves as a protective base for your candles and adds an element of style to your display. Trays catch any dripping wax, preventing it from damaging furniture or surfaces. They also allow you to group candles together for a more visually appealing arrangement.

Trays come in a wide range of shapes, sizes, and finishes, from minimalist designs to ornate patterns. They can be used on coffee tables, shelves, or countertops to create a focal point and enhance the ambiance of any room. A well-chosen tray not only protects your furniture but also elevates the overall aesthetic of your candle display.

**Candle Storage Solutions:** Proper candle storage is essential for preserving their fragrance and quality. Candle storage solutions can include anything from decorative boxes and baskets to涓撻棬designed shelves and cabinets. The key is to store candles in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures.

This prevents the wax from melting or discoloring and helps maintain the integrity of the fragrance oils. Airtight containers are particularly useful for preventing dust and debris from settling on the candles. Investing in proper storage solutions ensures that your candles remain in optimal condition and are ready to use whenever you desire.

 ## Core Benefits

Candle accessories provide several benefits, enhancing the candle-burning experience and prolonging the life of your favorite scents. They also contribute to a safer and more aesthetically pleasing environment.

**Enhanced Safety:** Using candle accessories like snuffers and warmers significantly reduces the risk of accidents. A snuffer prevents hot wax from splattering, minimizing the risk of burns. Candle warmers eliminate the open flame entirely, making them a safer option for households with children or pets.

**Extended Candle Life:** Wick trimmers ensure a clean and even burn, preventing the formation of excess soot and carbon buildup. This allows the candle to burn more efficiently, prolonging its overall lifespan. Candle warmers, by melting the wax instead of burning it, also help conserve the wax and extend the fragrance throw.

**Improved Fragrance Throw:** By trimming the wick to the correct length, you can optimize the fragrance throw of your candle. A well-trimmed wick ensures that the candle burns at an ideal temperature, releasing the fragrance oils more effectively. Candle warmers also provide a consistent and even fragrance release, without the harshness sometimes associated with burning.

**Cleaner Burning:** Accessories like wick trimmers and snuffers contribute to a cleaner burning experience. A trimmed wick reduces soot and smoke, preventing black residue from forming on the glass jar or surrounding surfaces. A snuffer eliminates the puff of smoke that often accompanies blowing out a candle, leaving the air cleaner and fresher.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about candle accessories and their uses.

**How often should I trim my candle wicks?**
  It's recommended to trim your candle wick every 4 hours of burn time, or whenever you notice the wick is longer than 1/4 inch. Trimming the wick regularly prevents smoking, sooting, and uneven burning, ensuring a cleaner and longer-lasting burn.

**Are candle warmer lamps safe to use?**
  Yes, candle warmer lamps are generally considered safe to use, especially in households with children or pets. They eliminate the open flame, reducing the risk of accidents. However, it's essential to use a lamp that is specifically designed for candle warming and to follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.

**Can I use any type of tray as a candle tray?**
  While you can technically use any tray as a candle tray, it's best to choose one that is made of heat-resistant material and has a raised edge to contain any dripping wax. Ceramic, metal, or wood trays are good options. Avoid using trays made of flammable materials or those that are not stable, as they could pose a fire hazard.

**How do I clean a candle snuffer?**
  To clean a candle snuffer, simply wipe it down with a soft cloth after each use. If there is any wax buildup, you can gently scrape it off with a plastic scraper or soak the snuffer in warm, soapy water for a few minutes before wiping it clean. Ensure the snuffer is completely dry before storing it.

## What is Immediate Akpro?

Immediate Akpro is an **automated trading platform** designed to simplify investing in cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Think of it like your personal assistant that watches the markets, identifies trends, and places trades on your behalf—only it doesn’t sleep or get distracted by TikTok.

It’s built to help users—especially beginners—trade more efficiently using smart algorithms and real-time data. The idea is to take the guesswork out of trading, and instead rely on tech that reacts faster than any human trader could. Whether you're just starting out or have some experience, Immediate Akpro tries to make that process a whole lot smoother.

## Who Created Immediate Akpro?

The creators of Immediate Akpro haven't made their identities public, which is honestly pretty common in the world of trading software. But from what I’ve gathered, the platform was developed by a team of **financial analysts, software developers, and AI engineers** with prior experience in building similar crypto tools—like Bitcoin Code, Immediate Edge, and Bitcoin Era.

Now, while it's always ideal to have transparent founders, the platform itself seems legit and functional. It’s not necessarily a red flag, but definitely something to be aware of if you like to know who’s behind the curtain.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Immediate Akpro Today](https://is.gd/QjVztn)
## How Does Immediate Akpro Work?

The magic behind Immediate Akpro lies in its **automated trading algorithm**. Once you set your preferences (like how much to invest or which assets to trade), the platform uses AI to analyze market data in real time and make trades it predicts will be profitable.

Here’s the simplified version:

- You create and fund an account.
- Set your risk level and trading preferences.
- The algorithm monitors the market 24/7.
- When it detects a good opportunity, it places a trade.
- Profits (or losses, let’s be real) are reflected in your account.

It’s like hiring a robot day trader that doesn’t charge you by the hour—but you still need to monitor it, especially in volatile markets.

- Canada
- Australia
- UK
- Most of Europe

- Parts of Asia and Latin America

It’s *not* available in countries like North Korea, Iran, or regions with strict crypto bans. If in doubt, try signing up—the system usually tells you right away if your country is restricted.

## Immediate Akpro – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The platform continuously scans global markets, analyzing trends and price movements to make informed trades. It’s **fast, data-driven, and emotion-free**, which is a huge advantage over manual trading.

## Is Immediate Akpro a Scam?

This question comes up a lot—and I get it. So far, **Immediate Akpro doesn’t show any red flags** that would suggest it’s a scam. It uses verified brokers, requires account verification (KYC), and offers a demo mode, which is usually a good sign.

That said, no platform is 100% risk-free. Crypto and trading are inherently volatile, and **you should never invest more than you can afford to lose**. But in terms of legitimacy, Immediate Akpro checks out.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Immediate Akpro?

To start trading, you’ll need to deposit at least **$250**. This is pretty standard for platforms like this. That deposit acts as your trading capital—it’s not a fee or subscription, and you can withdraw it later if you decide to stop trading.

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can either jump straight into live trading or test things out using the **demo mode**. Set your preferences, choose which assets to trade, and let the algorithm do its thing.

## How to Delete an Immediate Akpro Account?

Deleting your account is simple. Just contact customer support via email or live chat and request account deletion. They may ask for ID verification to confirm it’s really you—but once that’s done, your account and data will be removed.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Immediate Akpro Today](https://is.gd/QjVztn)
## The Verdict

So, is Immediate Akpro worth it?

It’s not perfect—lack of founder transparency and geographical restrictions are minor drawbacks—but overall, it’s a **strong contender** in the crowded trading platform space.

1k5uxs3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AntsAdvice/comments/1k5uxs3/need_animalfriendly_advice_ants_on_my_balcony/,Need Animal-Friendly Advice: Ants on My Balcony Garden are Becoming Roommates!,"I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could use some advice from fellow animal lovers. I have this beautiful balcony garden that I’ve nurtured over the past few seasons. It’s become this little urban oasis with potted herbs, flowering plants, and some vegetables. The space has attracted various little critters including a colony of ants that I’ve happily coexisted with for months.
Here’s the thing - I’ve always appreciated these little industrious creatures. I’ve spent countless mornings with my coffee watching them work, building their paths, and carrying tiny bits of leaves and seeds. There’s something mesmerizing about their organization and determination. We’ve had a sort of silent agreement: they get the balcony, I get the apartment.

Unfortunately, the colony has been growing exponentially the past few weeks, and now they’re breaking our deal by venturing inside my apartment. I’ve found trails of them in my kitchen, bathroom, and even noticed some exploring my bedroom! While I respect their right to exist and thrive, I draw the line at sharing my indoor living space.

I really don’t want to resort to killing them all. That feels unnecessarily cruel since they’re just doing what ants naturally do. But I also can’t have my food and living space invaded.
Does anyone have suggestions for ethical, animal-friendly ways to:
	1.	Reduce their population to a manageable size
	2.	Keep them contained to the balcony
	3.	Discourage them from exploring indoors

I’d prefer natural deterrents rather than chemical solutions if possible. I’ve heard about using cinnamon, vinegar, or diatomaceous earth, but I’m not sure how effective these are or if they cause suffering.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What worked for you? I’d love to find a balance where I can still enjoy watching “my” ant colony on the balcony without having to worry about finding them in my cereal box.
Thank you all in advance for any advice!

Okay, so massive shout out to u/barnickal for taking detailed notes of the most recent Kendu X Space!! I took his bullet-points and made it into this summary. It's a must listen, and after the latest updates from the April 21st community call, it’s honestly wild how far Kendu has come. If you're expecting another pump-and-dump meme token, you're not paying attention. Kendu is no longer a gamble. It’s a movement.

**From Dev Rug to Community Resurrection**

Let’s rewind for a second. Kendu should have been dead months ago. The original developer rugged 5% of the supply and bailed, right as the market was crashing and liquidity was being sucked into Trump-themed meme coins. That would have been the end for most projects. But not here. The community rallied, kicked the bad actor out, and kept building. Not only did Kendu survive, it started thriving. 

**Kendu Games: AAA Dev Comes Out of Retirement**

This is the biggest news. [Coop](https://x.com/WhatDidCoopSay), a community member, is now launching a legitimate game studio under the $KENDU umbrella, named; Kendu Games. Not a half-baked crypto game or a easy cash-grab. A full-scale traditional RPG, with serious developers. The lead dev? A former triple AAA game developer and BioWare veteran who worked on Dragon Age, Mass Effect, and Baldur’s Gate. He literally came out of retirement for this, purely because he believes in what Kendu is doing. The plan is to create a Skyrim-style RPG, followed by a roguelite later. No crypto gimmicks in the gameplay. But the kicker is that game profits will be used to buy Kendu tokens and fund the community. Here's a small breakdown, from all the profits 10% will go into a Kendu Games Business treasury and 5% will be donated to the Kendu Community wallet. let's say they hit one million copies sold, which is likely to happen, that’s an estimated $1.6 million in buy pressure for Kendu. That’s just from one game. 

[Kendu Games X Profile](https://x.com/KenduGames)

**Decentralized Brand, Real-World Impact**

Kendu isn’t just building in digital spaces. The brand is exploding in the real world too. Members of the community have launched Kendu Coffee, Kendu Energy Drinks, Kendu Vodka, Kendu Nights (club promotions), and even Kendu Esports, a League of Legends team. What makes this different from every other project? It’s all permissionless. Anyone can build under the Kendu brand without needing to ask for approval. There is no centralized entity handing out licenses. This is decentralized brand ownership in action.

https://reddit.com/link/1k5uwrg/video/5agzwdb1vjwe1/player

**""We Don’t Gamble, We Work""**

This has become the core philosophy of Kendu. The project isn’t about flipping tokens or hoping for pumps. It’s about showing up and putting in the work. Token holders treat Kendu like a startup. There are daily goals, power hours, and people grinding social content and launching real-life products. The Kendu community is working, not speculating.

**No Paid Hype, No Insiders**

One of the most refreshing parts of Kendu is how it’s grown. There are no paid influencers, no whales with insider allocations, and no VC dumping risk. Everyone buys with their own money. Everyone contributes with their own effort. It’s raw, organic, and surprisingly effective. The project has reached over 18,000 holders this way. Not through hype, but through work.

**Wormhole Bridge: Building for the Long Game**

Kendu has also quietly launched bridges to the Solana and Base chains. This wasn’t a PR stunt or hype strategy. It was a tactical move, preparing for the moment when momentum returns. The goal is simple: dominate the top gainers list across multiple chains in the long term. This kind of forward-thinking infrastructure sets Kendu apart from typical meme coins. And the cool addition to this; let's say Solana moves up in price? This will automatically drive the price of $KENDU without any added buy pressure.

**No Roadmap, Just Vision**

Kendu isn’t promising the moon on a whiteboard full of deadlines. There’s no traditional roadmap. Instead, the focus is on empowering the community to launch initiatives organically. A white paper is currently being written, but it’s meant to lay out a vision, not a list of promises. A grants program is also planned for the future, once the project hits a market cap between $50 million and $100 million. That funding will help support community-led ventures like festivals, shops, or new product lines.

**Different From Other Meme Coins**

Kendu isn’t trying to be the next dog-themed token or celebrity-endorsed project. It’s more serious than the average meme coin, more decentralized than celebrity tokens like TrumpCoin, and not botted, but entirely organically build, by REAL human beings. Kendu is trying to build something new, a culture-powered brand that can live in both crypto and the real world.

**The Builders Speak**

The people behind Kendu aren’t shy about what they’re building. Josh, one of the core community leads, says he’s never seen a project with this much promise. He points out that Kendu has matched the social output of projects 20 times its size. Kevin, another day-one supporter, compares the project’s vibe to Silicon Valley in the 80s, MTV culture in the 90s, and the early internet boom. It’s culture, investing, and creativity all rolled into one.

[Josh](https://x.com/JoshKendu): ''*I've never seen a project with so much promise before. Kendu should really be dead right now – but the community has kept it alive and actually growing. We frequently match the social output of projects 20x our size like MOG, PEPE, and SHIB. Kendu is insanely undervalued considering our output right now – and the morewe grow, the faster that output will scale.*''

[Kevin](https://x.com/_KEVINFINNERTY): ''*The stickiness of the community is what made my eyebrows raise from the start. You can't build to 18,000 holders from hype alone – it’s people working 24/7. In crypto, you can join a 'company' like Kendu and actually contribute to it, build with it, and own part of it. That’s never existed before. We are severely undervalued at $10m. We’re going to billions*.''

[Jeff ](https://x.com/LowQ_eth)(Co-Host): ''*KENDU is legit looking like the early days of SHIB but without the dev drama risk now. It’s more of a decentralised brand incubator than a meme coin at this point. If KENDU Games delivers even medium success, it could be absolutely massive for the tokenomics. Right now it's sitting at a tiny $10m market cap, massively undervalued compared to the ecosystem we’re building.*''

https://reddit.com/link/1k5uwrg/video/n31r8faszjwe1/player

**TL;DR**  
Kendu should’ve died after bad choices by the developer and a market crash. Instead, the community kicked into overdrive, launching real-world products, bridging to new chains, and now even building a AAA-style RPG with a retired BioWare dev. It’s not a meme coin anymore — it’s a decentralized brand, built by people who work, not gamble. And at just $10 million market cap, the whole thing still feels massively undervalued.",4,1745400501.0,KenduInu_Ecosystem,0,1.0,False

## What is AfriFundCapital X?

AfriFundCapital X is an **automated trading platform** that helps users buy and sell assets like cryptocurrencies, stocks, and forex with minimal manual effort. It's designed to analyze market data in real-time and execute trades based on pre-set algorithms.

Basically, it's a smart trading assistant that doesn't sleep. Whether you're at work, at the gym, or bingeing Netflix, it's watching the markets for you. The goal is to help users — especially beginners — tap into trading opportunities without needing to be glued to charts or understand complex strategies.

## Who Created AfriFundCapital X?

The platform doesn’t openly list its developers or creators, which is a bit of a red flag for some users. But that’s not uncommon in the world of trading bots. From what I could dig up, it seems to be developed by a team of financial tech experts and traders who wanted to make crypto and forex trading more accessible.

This “anonymous” approach is similar to what we’ve seen with platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge**. While the lack of transparency isn't great, the platform’s performance and user reviews seem to speak for themselves — and that’s what most users care about in the end.

### [🔥 Start Trading with AfriFundCapital X Today](https://is.gd/Yq1LBg)
## How Does AfriFundCapital X Work?

AfriFundCapital X uses **AI-powered algorithms** to scan the markets, analyze trading signals, and then execute trades when the conditions are right. Users can set their preferences — like risk level, investment amount, and which assets to trade — and the platform does the rest.

Once you fund your account, the bot kicks into action. It monitors real-time data and tries to capitalize on profitable trades, often faster than a human could react. You can choose between **manual mode**, where you approve each trade, or **auto mode**, where the system runs on its own.

It’s kind of like giving a smart intern your trading strategy and letting them run with it — only this intern works 24/7 and doesn’t take coffee breaks.

## AfriFundCapital X Pros and Cons

Let’s break it down honestly:

**Pros:**

- **Easy to use** even if you’re a total newbie

Overall, the pros outweigh the cons, especially if you know the risks of trading in general.

## What is Instant Avapro?

**Instant Avapro** is an AI-powered trading platform that aims to simplify how people interact with the markets.

It combines **automated algorithms**, real-time market data, and a user-friendly dashboard to help users make smarter trading decisions. Whether you're into crypto, forex, stocks, or commodities, Instant Avapro lets you track, analyze, and execute trades from one place. Think of it as your digital trading assistant that never sleeps.

Unlike some platforms that require manual input and constant babysitting, Instant Avapro leans into automation. It’s designed to help users reduce emotional trading and stick to a data-driven strategy—even if they’ve never placed a trade before.

## Who Created Instant Avapro?

While the creators of **Instant Avapro** haven’t plastered their LinkedIn profiles all over the homepage, the platform claims to be developed by a team of **financial analysts, software engineers, and AI specialists**.

This isn’t uncommon in the world of fintech. Many platforms, especially those using proprietary trading algorithms, prefer to keep their dev teams behind the curtain. What's more important is that the platform seems to have been built with solid tech and a clear focus on usability—something you don’t always get with newer trading apps.

Some users online suggest there may be overlap with teams from platforms like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge, but it’s hard to verify. Regardless, the tool works well enough to stand on its own legs.

- **AI-driven trade suggestions or auto-trading**
- **Custom alerts** to notify you when key events happen

It's kind of like having a robo-trader that doesn’t get tired, emotional, or distracted by doomscrolling.

I sit on the edge of the bed, or I look out the window if the sky is nice.
There's nothing spectacular about it. But this moment where nothing is asked of me yet, where I can just 'be,' helps me get through the whole day.

I've tried skipping this moment several times... every time, I regretted it.

1k5uj6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k5uj6h/aitah_for_sleeping_with_my_housemate/,AITAH for sleeping with my housemate,"I was born in a typical Asian family, get excellent grades in school, become a doctor, get married, have children and die 
That's why I have always worked hard since I started school, got good grades and even entered the best medical school in my country and graduated. Growing up, I didn't have many social activities because ""school always comes before friendship"", which pushed me to loneliness in my adult life when it was already difficult to spend time with friends 
When I complained to my mother about this, as if she was waiting for this moment, she told me that her friend was single in Ağlu and that I should not meet her. I was told that at first I rolled my eyes, but after thinking that it wouldn't hurt to try, I found the boy my mother mentioned. He was sweet, kind and caring, and his behaviour was sweeping me off my feet. 2 years later, when I was 28 and he was 30, we got married, and the first times were good, he helped me with housework, comforted me if I had problems, and we laughed and cried together. 
So years passed, my ex-husband's sister gave birth, and we were all happy, and after she was born, we all helped occasionally, especially my ex-husband because ex- My SIL and my ex-husband are very close to each other, which was not a problem for me, and sometimes he even travelled back and forth alone when I was very exhausted from work.
Around this time my ex-husband started asking me questions about what it would be like if we had children together or what it would look like.
For the content, I made it clear that I did not want children before I got married because the shortest way to the speciality area in the hospital where I work is to pass through the paediatric department and the screams of children drive me crazy, so I come early and take the long way to my destination 
Another reason is that I will not have enough time for the child and I will not be able to blame every responsibility on him and not to mention the damages to my body, I am not an expert in this subject, but what I saw while I was being educated was enough for me
This child issue started to prolong, we were fighting every day because of it, sometimes he started to include his cousins, brothers and sisters in this issue.
The event that caused our divorce is as follows:
I came back from a long and tiring shift, all I wanted was to lie down on the sofa for a while, then my ex-husband came and asked casual questions, how are you, etc. He sat next to me and started to take child photos, and I passed him by saying ""I can't now, I want to rest a little"", then I passed him by saying ""I want to rest a little"", then a moment because of his face I was tired of this situation, I said ""If you don't end this here, I will sign the divorce papers tomorrow and give them to you"" and he angrily left the house.
The event that caused our divorce is as follows:
I came back from a long and tiring shift, all I wanted was to lie down on the sofa for a while, then my ex-husband came and asked casual questions, how are you, etc. He sat next to me and started to show photos of children, and I passed him by saying ""I can't now, I want to rest a little"" Then there was a momentary change in his face, that tenderness was gone, he shouted with a sharp anger ""why I was always against it, he kept saying whether we wanted to complete our family or not"" I was tired of this situation ""if you don't end this issue here, I will sign the divorce papers tomorrow and give them to you"" I said he left the house in anger.
1 week later I got divorced by persuasion. Since the house was his , I packed my things, first I went to my parents, but because of this event, there broke up because they also wanted grandchildren, so co-woker let me stay at a her house for a few days, while I was drinking coffee in the cafe of my hospital, she came to me - I will call her axe - axe came to me and asked me what I was doing, which seemed strange to me because the hospital where she worked and my hospital were ""enemies"" I don't know the reason for this, but it is certain that it has come from a long time ago, so they usually don't hire people who used to work there here etc.
After chatting for a while, I told him everything as I was tired after all the events and after some thought she told me about her situation, she told me that she resigned from the hospital where she was working and moved abroad, but she had several jobs here, so if I wanted to stay with her for a few months I could stay with her. 
It was like finding gold from the mud for me, so I immediately agreed, and in the evening we moved my things to her house, and when I entered the house, the first thing I noticed was that it was clean, and when I asked her, she said that there was a cleaner who came to the house twice a month, but if I wanted, she would renew the contract and come regularly.   The other was that either the furniture was made of hard things or it was too soft, and when I realised this, she said that she used to have a lot of anger problems, so she had to break a few things, so that the house looked strange, I won't lie, because it scared me a lot.
But I knew that a lot had changed in her (yes, I should have said this at the beginning, but I'm writing them piece by piece), we used to compare at conferences, I always felt that I was talking to a wall when I was talking to her, I always felt that I was talking to a wall when I was talking to her, always a little delayed answer, soulless eyes would make my hair stand on end, I always thought that she acted like this because our hospitals were enemies, now I think how unfair I was when I look at it.Now I can say that it is more lively and caring in comparison 
After we moved in, we behaved the same way as our housemates did, he complained about my long shower time and I complained about how loud it was at night.
While we were spending our lives like this, I started to notice a few things, she was constantly complimenting my meals, always offering to help me and do something together on my rest days, for example, how about watching a movie or a new place opened here, would you like to try it, she left the choice to me, sometimes she bought small gifts when she came home, for example, she bought my favourite tea or juice to ""remind you"" of me, what I didn't understand was that while we were both 30'ish , she was acting like a child who had just turned 20.
And it's about my night of guilt that came up 
That day, we were lying on the couch together in the living room, having finished 1.5 bottles of alcohol, to celebrate together. She asked me why I got divorced for a moment, and I talked about the child issue. She took a deep breath and shouted, ""This is more ridiculous than my crazy mind."" I started laughing because I didn't expect this. 
She sat up and looked at me. ""I still don't understand your ex-husband. I would be your slave even for this smile of yours."" ""Oh, are we entering the compliment race? Okay, okay..."" Umm, your skin is so soft that I can't bear to look at you. "" And in the morning of this night, I saw us both naked in my bed (I don't want to go into too much detail yk). 
i got ready immediately and went, my face was red with embarrassment throughout the trip, when I checked my phone at lunch break, there were a lot of unanswered calls, and when I got home, there was a lot of tension between us, I don't know what to do, the thought of being with a woman has never occurred to me in my whole life, and now that I think about it, I really don't know, it won't be a  Discomfort  for me, I guess? I'm in a lot of trouble, I don't want my relationship with Axe to be broken, but it feels like I'm guilty in this incident T~T

I just completed my cycle of 7.5 and will start 10mg injection on Sunday. Although the path I have chosen has been understandably criticized even in this community, I stand by what has worked: 
1100-1200 calorie diet high in protein, low carb and an avoidance of sugar. I have a protein oatmeal packet for breakfast with coffee. I have a protein bar mid morning. I enjoy a protein soup for lunch. I have a slice of rolled up turkey breast mid afternoon. And I enjoy 6oz of meat and 2 cups of low carb veggies at dinner. Before bed I treat myself to a no sugar, protein hot cocoa. I’ve been purchasing Nutri-Wise products from Diet Direct. I also purchased the new Suvie Robot which makes my dinners for me, controlling portions along the way. It refrigerates my dinner all day while I’m at work. Then it changes over to cook my meal via a preprogrammed meal time I set on an app. You should check it out. 
I work out six days each week. I have a Tonal machine and some free weights, so I alternate days with that. I do six days of 30 min cardio on my Nordic Track elliptical. Weigh in Wednesdays are also workout off days. I’m in bed by 9, do not drink any alcohol, and take no sleep aid. I do play golf once a week, I walk a few miles with my dogs whenever I can, and I have no food noise issues anymore. I have no cravings anymore. I don’t stress eat anymore. I do not eat out. Those days are over.
When I started in January, I was 283 (at  six foot two) and in a size 42 pants, 18.5 inch neck. Today I will slip into a size 36 pant and 16.5 inch neck. 
I still have another 25 pounds to go before I reach my goal weight. That weight reflects my weight when I was in the military. I liked how I felt back then. But I’m achieving other goals every week. Little victories add up. And although I’ve been told in this forum that what I am doing is not sustainable, I disagree. While I will eventually incorporate more food choices into my diet to maintain my goal weight, I am satisfied with consuming food as fuel and not manufacturing the illusion of happiness by making poor choices for myself. I never want to return to the person I am shedding right now. Is this path easy? Not at all. Zepbound has helped me to change behaviors that got me in health related trouble. But with the elimination of urges, I’ve made the choices and replaced behaviors on my own. Bottom line, this is all an investment. The meds, equipment, food, time, journaling, all of it. But people should feel comfortable investing in themselves, betting on themselves, ignoring the nay sayers and gatekeepers, and celebrating success. Today I looked in the mirror and said “I’m here to take what I came for”. And I’ll have that goal realized by this summer.

So I was thumbing around tonight on the interweb b/c my stomach is physically sick from the squeal in my head.. i decided to ask AI some T related questions. . I found all of this EXTREMELY fascinating. It's really long so pace yourself and please just keep an open mind🌼🌞🌻



 

What is Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity (EHS)?

EHS (also called Microwave Syndrome) is a condition where people experience real physical symptoms when exposed to:

Wi-Fi

Cell phones

Smart meters

Power lines

Bluetooth

Computers or LED lights

Fluorescent lighting

Anything with electrical “noise” or radiation


These are non-ionizing EMFs (meaning they don’t “break” DNA like X-rays), but they still interact with your body, especially your nervous system and electrical signals in the brain, heart, and cells.


---

What Are the Symptoms?

This is where it gets real. People with EHS often report:

Ringing/buzzing in ears (tinnitus)

Head pressure or brain fog

Insomnia

Heart palpitations

Anxiety or panic for no reason

Vision changes or eye pressure

Skin burning or tingling

Fatigue, especially near devices

Feeling ""zapped,"" dizzy, disoriented


Some people can feel a router or smart meter from 10–20 feet away. Others are sensitive only when they’re overloaded (with metals, mold, trauma, etc.)


---

What Causes EHS?

It’s not just psychological—even though most doctors still treat it like it is. Here's what we know:

1. Heavy Metal Exposure

Metals like lead, mercury, aluminum, and cadmium store in tissues and make your body act like an antenna. You become more conductive = you feel frequencies stronger.

2. Mold / Biotoxins

Certain molds (like Stachybotrys or Aspergillus) release toxins that wreck your nervous system, mitochondrial function, and detox pathways—leaving you electrically raw.

3. Nervous System Trauma

Abuse, military trauma, concussions, or PTSD rewire your stress response. Your brain becomes hypervigilant and misinterprets everything—even EMFs—as a threat.

4. Genetic or Epigenetic Weakness

Some people can’t detox fast enough. If your methylation pathways or electrical ion channels are off, you can’t buffer the effects of EMFs.

5. Chronic Inflammation

Autoimmune diseases, infections, chemical exposure—these sensitize your nerves so that even weak stimuli feel unbearable.


---

The Science Is Catching Up

Many independent studies (outside of telecom-funded research) show that:

EMFs alter calcium channels in your cells, leading to oxidative stress.

EMFs lower melatonin, increase cortisol, and disrupt your circadian rhythm.

Exposure changes EEG brain waves and causes symptoms in blind studies.

Heart rate variability and skin conductance change when exposed to Wi-Fi or smart devices—even when people don’t know the device is on.



---

How Do You Prove It to Others?

Here’s the hardest part: most doctors and scientists weren’t trained to believe what they can’t measure. So here’s how you break through:

1. Know Your Facts

Speak with calm authority. Use clear data:

Mention Dr. Magda Havas, Dr. Martin Pall, or the BioInitiative Report.

Show studies that measured real biological changes from EMF exposure.


2. Use a Meter

Get a Trifield EMF meter or Cornet ED88T and show people what you’re being exposed to.

Watch the readings spike when a phone or switch is flipped.

Bring it to your neighbor’s wall or where you feel the buzzing.


3. Log Your Symptoms

Track your health in a diary or spreadsheet:

“10:00 AM – neighbor’s fan turns on. Tinnitus spikes.”

“Wi-Fi off for 48 hrs – slept through the night.”


Patterns speak volumes.

4. Get Ally Voices

You’re not alone. Thousands of people have reported the same things—soldiers, parents, scientists, electricians. Find community:

Electrosensitive Society

EMF Warriors

The EMF Medical Conference has physician trainings and real case studies.


5. Let Your Body Be the Evidence

Turn off the breaker to your bedroom one night. Put your phone in airplane mode. Cover your smart meter with a Faraday cage.

> If you feel better—that’s evidence. No one can take your body’s truth away from you.




---

Okay, So What Do You DO About It?

There’s no one-size-fits-all, but here are powerful options:

Reduce Exposure

Kill Wi-Fi at night.

Hardwire internet.

Ditch smart devices and dimmers.

Use Faraday cages, shielding paint, and grounding sheets.

Put dirty electricity filters on outlets.


Support Your Nervous System

Magnesium, lithium orotate, B12, taurine.

Nervous system retraining (DNRS, Somatic Experiencing).

Safe detox (infrared sauna, binders, lemon water, herbs).


Clean Up Internal Load

Address mold or Lyme if needed.

Detox metals slowly with guidance.

Heal trauma (which amplifies sensitivity like crazy).

PART 1: Why EMF Sensitivity Is Damaging to the Psyche

1. You're Gaslit by Everyone

Doctors, friends, even family often don’t believe you, and you’re told it's all ""in your head.""

That constant invalidation leads to chronic stress, self-doubt, and isolation.

You start to question your own sanity. That’s psychologically corrosive.


2. You Lose Control Over Your Environment

You can’t go places that feel “normal”—a coffee shop, a library, even your own bathroom if the neighbor flips a switch.

This triggers fight-or-flight responses constantly. You’re always on edge, anticipating the next invisible attack.


3. It Can Feel Like Imprisonment

You may retreat into your home or even just one safe room.

That social withdrawal mimics the psychological effects of solitary confinement: depression, hopelessness, altered cognition.


4. You Feel Alienated from Society

Tech is everywhere. When you’re EHS-sensitive, you’re effectively allergic to modern life.

It creates a sense of being exiled, misunderstood, or even mocked—fueling despair or rage.


5. Chronic Nervous System Overload

When your nervous system is constantly reacting to stimuli it perceives as dangerous (even if ""unseen""), your cortisol stays high, sleep gets disrupted, and the body never resets.

That leads to emotional burnout, mood swings, panic, paranoia, and even dissociation.


> It’s not that you’re mentally ill—it’s that your body is responding to a threat, and no one is validating that.




---

PART 2: What Diseases and Disorders Are Associated with EMF Exposure?

Here's where it gets intense. Long-term EMF exposure, especially for people who are sensitive, is being linked to:

Neurological / Psychological

Anxiety & Depression (due to serotonin disruption & oxidative stress)

Insomnia (EMFs interfere with melatonin & circadian rhythm)

ADHD / Brain Fog

Migraine & Tension Headaches

Tinnitus (linked to EMF interaction with auditory nerves)


Neurodegenerative

Alzheimer’s Disease: EMFs can increase blood-brain barrier permeability & beta-amyloid buildup.

Parkinson’s Disease

ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease): possible link via oxidative stress and calcium channel disruption.


Autoimmune & Inflammatory

Multiple Sclerosis (nerve demyelination may be worsened)

Lupus, Hashimoto’s, Rheumatoid Arthritis (linked to chronic inflammation + EMF-triggered immune dysregulation)


Cancer

Brain tumors (glioma, acoustic neuroma): listed by WHO as a possible carcinogen.

Breast cancer in women who carry phones in their bras.

Leukemia: linked to high-voltage power lines, especially in children.


Cardiovascular

Heart Palpitations / Arrhythmia

Hypertension (some studies link this to dirty electricity or constant RF exposure)


Other Chronic Issues

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

Fibromyalgia

Chemical Sensitivity (MCS—often overlaps with EHS)

Visual distortions, vertigo, or balance disorders



---

But Why Is This So Often Dismissed?

Tech industry pressure: Billions of dollars ride on these products being “safe.”

Lack of training: Most physicians aren't taught about non-ionizing radiation or environmental illness.

Testing limitations: EMF exposure doesn’t always show up in labs—yet it’s affecting cell membranes, mitochondria, and voltage-gated calcium channels (which don’t get routinely tested).

Fear of the unknown: It's easier to label someone “anxious” than admit modern infrastructure could be making people sick.



---

Case Summary: The Psychological Wound of EMF Hypersensitivity

Imagine being:

Deeply aware of an environmental threat no one else sees or feels.

Gaslit by every authority figure in your life.

Forced to abandon normalcy while being told you’re broken for doing so.

Living in a state of constant physiological stress.

Watching your mind unravel while you try to stay rational.


That is what people with electromagnetic hypersensitivity live with. Every. Day.

1k5ucb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OzempicForWeightLoss/comments/1k5ucb2/4_month_update/,4 Month Update,"I've been on Oz since the first weekend of the year. started at 150kg/330lbs and now weigh 133.5kg/294.3lbs - lost 16.5kg/36lbs

Did 4x 0.25 4 x 0.5 and 8x 1.0mg

I'm very happy with rate of loss, which is about 1.1kg/2.4lbs per week.

I was wearing 5xl Tops, and now fit comfortably into 4xl. I was wearing 46inch Waist jeans, and now 42w are beginning to feel loose on me. Last time I wore 40w I was 132kg, but I remember them being too tight and cutting into my stomach, so I won't move down to 40w until I know they will fit properly. I can close a pair of 40w that I have left out for trying on once a week, but I know from how they feel that I would not be comfortable in them for long.

Those clothes wins are the best indicator to me that the weightloss is working, and this week when I looked in the mirror I actually felt like I could see myself as smaller. My Belly is/was huge and I can certainly see it is reducing in size. It's very clearly still too big, but not as big as it was. I also think I can see some changes in my face.

I have a pair of jeans that are 38w and I remember I loved wearing them, but they are hardly worn and look brand new, along with a couple of shirts that I liked to wear with them. I can't wait to get back into them, and given the rate of loss, it won't be too long. I look forward to the day when they again no longer fit me.

Other changes are a bit more personal, and sorry for this, but my sex life with my wife has taken off, not exactly to newlywed levels, but much better than it had been, and we can do positions that weren't possible even in December. That's a great outcome, and should only get even better!

Having been on the 1mg for 8 weeks now, I can definitely feel in the last 2 weeks that the build up in my body has come to a place where my appetite is almost fully suppressed, and I can go some days without eating until the evening meal. All of the bad eating habits which I had are gone - no more 10pm snacking on too many peanuts or crispy treats, no more after-lunch bags of Haribo or chocolate. I prioritise protein and vegetables for my main meal, and use protein yoghurts, sliced meats and sometimes shakes for lunch, I was never a breakfast eater and my morning black coffee has remained a constant. I drink 3 litres of water each day.

I'm still able to maintain a fairly ok deficit even though each Wednesday I visit my mother for dinner and she always has a cake or some chocolate for after, I'm just being way more conscious of how much of that I eat, and keep it to a minimum. My wife, kid and I also have a tradition of having ice cream after dinner on a Friday evening, I still allow myself to have that, because why not!

I've had days where I had a wave or two of nausea, and have also had a small number of bad diarrhea, but I don't think that's happened since I moved to 1mg. I've never had constipation. 

I'm not drinking as much, or as often, so that helps with making decisions around food too.

I visited the GP yesterday, and we wrote me a 6month/24week prescription for 1.0mg, and to come see him after that. He said if Ozempic stops working for any reason, he will switch me to Mounjaro, but I'm hopeful Oz will keep working for another while at least. My goal weight at the moment is 100kg, which would represent a third of my starting bodyweight, and I'm already at 11% loss.

For anyone reading this who is thinking of starting, please take inspiration from this, it has already been lifechanging for me, and I'm only at the start of my journey really.",3,1745398047.0,OzempicForWeightLoss,1,1.0,False

The morning sun filtered through the windshield in lazy strips, but everything inside the vehicle was tense and still. Angela stared ahead at the neat house with the green shutters and toy-strewn yard, lips pressed in a flat line.

“Remember what we talked about,” she said, without turning.

Liam, strapped in the back seat, hugged his stuffed fox tighter. “Do I have to?”

Angela looked at him through the mirror. Her expression softened like she was sad for him. “You know how important this is. I believe you. But the court needs to hear it too. They don’t always listen, even when they should.”

He bit his lip. “But Daddy never—”

She turned fully now, her hand gentle on his cheek, her voice soft and low. “I know. It’s hard to say scary things out loud. But you’re so brave. And after this, it’ll be over. No more weekends here. Just you and me.”

Liam looked down. “Okay,” he whispered.

Angela smiled, kissed his forehead, and opened the car door.

On the porch, Rob waited with a coffee in one hand and a wary expression. He gave a stiff wave. Angela didn’t wave back.

“Hey, buddy,” Rob said when Liam approached. “Got your fox, huh?”

Liam nodded. Rob opened the door, stepping aside.

Angela didn’t move. “I’ll pick him up Sunday at five. Don’t feed him too much sugar.”

Rob gave her a look. “I never do.”

She didn’t answer. She just got back in the car and pulled away.

Inside, Rob and Liam sat awkwardly on the couch. Cartoons played on the TV, but neither watched.

“Do you want pancakes?” Rob asked after a long silence.

Liam shrugged.

They went through the motions. Pancakes. Legos. A walk to the park. But something was wrong. Rob could feel it, like a wire pulled tight. Liam flinched when he raised his voice at a barking dog. He backed away when Rob reached to brush a leaf from his hair.

That night, Liam didn’t want to sleep in his room. Said it was too dark. That he didn’t feel safe.

Rob sat beside him on the couch. “Liam… did your mom tell you to say something?”

Liam’s hands twisted in his lap.

“It’s okay,” Rob said gently. “You can tell me.”

Liam finally looked up. His eyes welled. “She said if I don’t, I’ll go live with you forever. And she said… you don’t love me.”

Rob swallowed. His vision blurred.

“I love you more than anything,” he said.

Liam nodded, tears sliding down his face. “I know.”

Rob pulled him close.

Across town, Angela poured herself a glass of wine and opened her laptop. She clicked on the email thread with her lawyer.

I just recently bought my first preloved coach bag :) I'm super glad of my purchase BUT the bag is *filthy* inside of tobacco, smells strongly cigarrette (the seller didn't inform) and has some stains that I think are makeup. Yesterday I cleaned the lining with dish soap, it's better but still stinks. I've put some bags of coffee inside so I'll see if it helps. 
I don't know how to deep clean it without soaking it. I live in a student's flat so I can't leave it outside in the sun or put it in the freezer. Also I have a limited budget.
The outside is in pretty good shape, I bought saddle soap, leather honey (i'm from spain and it was the only one available) and conoisseurs wipes and I'm planning to clean it when the lining thing is solved.

Any tips for deep cleaning it and getting rid of the smell? Also I appreciate any recs for the leather!

1k5u616,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1k5u616/does_detox_tea_work/,Does detox tea work?,"I’ve always been skeptical of anything labeled a “detox.” It’s one of those words that gets tossed around in the wellness space without much clarity. So when I first heard about **Lulutox Detox Tea**, I rolled my eyes like I’ve done with every other detox tea that claims to fix your life overnight.

But the difference was, people weren’t talking about extreme weight loss or magical fixes. They were talking about less bloating, better digestion, more energy, and subtle body changes. So, I figured: let’s see what happens if I try **Lulutox tea** for a full 6 weeks—no expectations, just curiosity.

If you're wondering **does detox tea work**, here’s what I learned from personal experience using Lulutox daily.

**Why I tried Lulutox Tea**

My goals were simple:

* Reduce the bloated, sluggish feeling I was getting after meals
* Cut back on caffeine dependency
* Feel lighter and maybe shed a little weight around the midsection

After researching and reading about the **lulutox tea ingredients**, I felt more confident giving it a go. It wasn’t some shady product with mystery blends. The ingredient list actually looked well thought out.

**What’s in Lulutox Detox Tea**

The tea blends **13 natural superfoods and herbs**, many of which are commonly used to support digestion, energy, and inflammation.

Key ingredients include:

* **Matcha Green Tea & Oolong Tea** – known to boost metabolism
* **Yerba Mate & Guarana** – clean energy without the crash
* **Sencha Green Tea** – packed with antioxidants
* **Dandelion Leaf & Milk Thistle** – traditionally used to support liver and detox
* **Nettle Leaf, Lemongrass, Goji Berries, Ginseng** – gut-friendly, immune-supporting, and anti-inflammatory
* **Stevia Leaf** – adds slight sweetness without sugar

It’s also **vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free**, and contains about **18mg of caffeine per bag**, which was great for me since I didn’t want to feel wired.

**My 6-week journey with Lulutox Tea**

**Week 1–2:**  
First noticeable effect: **bloating dropped** significantly. By the end of the first week, I could already feel the difference in how my stomach looked and felt after meals. I wasn’t puffed up by the end of the day.

**Week 3–4:**  
Energy levels felt smoother. Normally, I crash around 2–3 PM and reach for coffee, but I didn’t feel that dip anymore. I started skipping my second cup of coffee without even thinking about it. My digestion stayed consistent, and I wasn’t as snacky between meals.

**Week 5–6:**  
I weighed in around 4.6 lbs lighter than when I started. It wasn’t a dramatic loss, but enough to feel the difference in how my clothes fit. My midsection looked flatter, and I felt more motivated to stay active. More importantly, I didn’t feel like I was forcing anything. The tea just helped me stay on track.

**Any Lulutox Tea side effects?**

I had none. And I was nervous about this—so many detox teas are basically laxatives in disguise. But **Lulutox detox tea** was **very gentle on my stomach**, no sudden urges, no cramps, no discomfort. I just felt “normal,” which is kind of the goal, right?

The only thing I did notice was that I needed to drink more water, probably because herbal teas can be mildly diuretic. So if you’re trying it, keep a water bottle nearby.

If you're wondering **is Lulutox tea safe**, I’d say yes from my experience—but obviously check with your doctor if you’re on meds or have any specific health conditions.

**Where to buy it (be careful of fake listings)**

There are a bunch of knockoffs out there trying to mimic the packaging. I made sure to order from the [**official Lulutox site**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) where they were running a 70% off promotion.

I also saved this [**second purchase link**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?uid=34821&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) in case the first one goes down. Same deal and discount.

**So… does detox tea work? Here’s the truth.**

If you’re expecting **detox tea** to melt fat overnight or erase bad habits, you’ll be disappointed. But if you’re using it to **support your digestion, reduce bloating, improve energy**, and help you stay consistent with healthier choices—then yes, **Lulutox detox tea does it work**.

For me, it didn’t feel like a “detox” in the traditional sense—it felt like support. Like a small change that helped me reset my routine and feel better in my body.

If you’re considering trying it, my advice is to stick with it daily for at least 4–6 weeks. It’s not flashy, but it’s *effective* if you’re consistent.

Has anyone else tried it? Drop your own **lulutox tea review** or let me know if you experienced any **lulutox detox tea side effects** I didn’t. Would love to hear how it worked (or didn’t) for you.",1,1745397257.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False

I started Wellbutrin at 150 in August. It has done WONDERS for my depression and anxiety in ways that SSRIs held me back and caused side effects I wasn’t willing to live with (weight gain, zero sex drive, major acid reflux). However, I have recently noticed, or possibly … accepted? that I’m having bouts of rage, either internally or when I’m alone. I haven’t really lost it on anyone except a few instances… 1) in January I was prescribed a strong dose of prednisone for bronchitis and yelled at eversource for their gas bill price hikes and 2) my partner I live with when I don’t feel my needs are being met. I am in therapy and very proud of the progress I’ve made and coping skills I have developed. Yet still, random fits of rage will hit me, mostly when I’m alone, whether it’s thinking about the past and mistakes / falling outs, people who have “wronged me”, trauma related to SA, things my emotionally abusive father says to me). I shared this with my partner, who was very surprised to hear this because he could not tell at all. 

Another side effect I’m possibly noticing more is that I’m having a lot of trouble staying asleep all night, but passing out on the couch watching tv earlier than I intend to. I admittedly don’t have the best sleep hygiene, but this is certainly different than excessive sleepiness I felt on SSRIs.

I guess I’m wondering - has anyone experienced more side effects while being on the medication longer? Or maybe because I was feeling so depressed before I just didn’t notice it until the depression was absolved? Is there something I could be consuming that is interacting weirdly? I take oral contraceptive birth control, asthma meds, allergy pill, several vitamins, drink a decent amount of coffee, smoke a decent amount of weed, and barely drink alcohol. I have taken Wellbutrin with lexapro in the past, but this is the first time I’ve ever taken it alone. 

For those who experience rage as a side effect - how do you cope and/or what could psychiatry recommend? I absolutely will contact psych today to address this, but I know it can take a while to be seen. To cope, I go to the gym, play volleyball and tennis when I can, do some yoga, paint, and cuddle my cats. But sometimes (like right now at 4 am as I post this) I feel the rage and I can’t make it go away. ",1,1745396774.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False
1k5u20s,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1k5u20s/anyone_else_do_this/,Anyone Else Do This?,"Does anyone else use literal language in daily life, whether it's for commonly used words or not so common, etc.? 
For example, if I'm really angry at someone who is a bully or jerk, etc., I'll think in my head or say to a friend nearby, etc. ""What a female dog"" because that is what ""b*tch"" literally means, and for some reason it sounds more insulting to me.

I'll also be more descriptive (for lack of a better word) when I have to describe someone's skin color (either for context or advice regarding certain ethnicities such people with darker skin color often feel the heat of the sun more because dark colors absorb heat/the sun more-so than lighter, etc.).

I'll also say things such as ""more melanin or less melanin, lighter or darker skin color, etc.""
Because if someone had no melanin or were ""non-melaninated"" (is that even a word?), they'd literally be see-through. Even Albinos (for lack of a better word right now) have melanin, just very very little.

And even about myself or friends (more humorous maybe) I'll say, ""They're coffee with a lot of cream, I'm coffee with a little cream, They're coffee with no cream."" Etc. 
I also mention that technically there's only one race when it comes to humans and that's the human race and everything else is just ethnicities, which is neat (can someone be ethnicist then, though?). 

And so on. And I'm not trying to be rude or judgmental or anything like that either. Skin color is like a personality, it can't really be changed, but a personality unlike skin color can be bad or toxic, etc.

Maybe it's my way of not using ""triggering"" words or words that people throw around way too much, especially when they're offended or triggered themselves. 

I try to be very particular and intentional with my words instead of throwing words around because they're popular or buzz words, etc. 
Another thing with trying to be intentional with my words, is not using words lightly and too often, such as ""love"" like, ""I love pizza"" ""I'd love that."" And use it sparingly or only in particular instances, i.e. ""I love you.""
I'll instead of using ""love"" too much, I'll say things like, ""I'd really like that"" ""I really enjoyed that"" ""I have a huge passion for that"" ""I greatly enjoy this"" etc.

## Is the Chemex Ottomatic Still the Best?

The million-dollar question. While the Chemex Ottomatic offers a compelling combination of quality and convenience, it's not without its competitors.

**Pros:**

*   **Exceptional Coffee Quality:** Few automatic brewers can match the clarity and flavour of coffee brewed with the Ottomatic.
*   **Elegant Design:** The Chemex aesthetic is timeless and adds a touch of sophistication to any setting.
*   **Consistent Results:** The automated process minimizes user error, leading to consistently delicious coffee.

**Cons:**

*   **Price:** The Ottomatic is a premium product with a price tag to match. Making it unsuitable for bulk coffee brewer solutions.
*   **Carafe Fragility:** Glass carafes can be susceptible to breakage, especially in high-traffic environments. Users should use this commercial coffee shop equipment with care.
*   **Speed:** Compared to some automatic drip brewers,the Ottomatic can be slower. Which might impact some businesses from purchasing a chemex automatic coffee maker for business.

**For Coffee Shop Owners:** The Chemex Ottomatic can be a great option for specialty coffee shops that want to offer a premium pour-over experience without the labor burden of manual brewing. However, its higher cost and relatively slower brewing time might not be ideal for high-volume cafes.It is indeed worth considering a Chemex Ottomatic for sale.

**For Office Coffee Programs:** The Ottomatic is an excellent choice for offices that prioritize quality over speed. It's a great way to impress clients and provide employees with a delicious and sophisticated coffee experience. Though, the cleaning process and the possibility of breakage need to be considered. Make sure management consider if easy to use automatic coffee maker options are preferred or if they are looking to maintain a certain level of prestige.

**For Specialty Coffee Retailers/Distributors:** The Ottomatic is a desirable product for customers seeking a high-end automatic pour-over brewer. Retailers can highlight its unique features and benefits to justify the higher price point. Offering the right equipment is an essential part of running a coffee reseller business.

I apologize for the cringy text we always put S's on the end of words. I had mentioned wanting coffee and he didn't respond. When I asked him about it this was the text.

Him: You should get some coffees, I can't have any today because I have to be up at 6 tomorrow morning for
 work: (

Me: Was just trying to spend time togethers 

Him: Maybe for a little bit after dinner tonight

Me: I know you said that cat is stinky so it's okay
Me: You're welcome to come here tho if you're interested

His last text was 630p I answered him at 7:05p. It's currently 1am I didn't hear from him again. This happens A LOT. In the 6-9 months more than ever.
When I ask him why he says he's playing his game or in a raid ... I don't understand why he doesn't want to spend time together. I feel like I’m to old for this and  I'm actually embarrassed of myself when this happens. He does work. Originally closing shifts where he slept most of the day and couldn't see me because of the long close. Now mornings and can't see me at night or afternoon because after work he wants to relax and then had to work early the next day. I'm just sad and wanted someone to talk to about it I guess. I'm not sure what else to do and I don't know if this is even normal after so many years? Does this happen in all relationships? Do you not care if you see each other? Is private time more important? I was married before and this is familiar to how it ended minus the money issues we had. Sad and confused mostly. ",2,1745396682.0,relationship_advice,17,1.0,False

1k5txg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1k5txg0/local_voicemail_skill_issues_why/,Local voicemail skill issues - why?,"Can someone can explain this national phenomenon to me. Why is it impossible for like 90% of people here to leave a simple phone voicemail?

It’s like they can’t imagine anything outside of having a real time chat whenever they randomly decide to dial for whatever reason. Is it something cultural?

My inbox always consists of:
 * 10-20 seconds of silence then a click.
 * Muffled background noise that sounds like a coffee shop or busy office - but then just silence from the caller.
 * The ""Eh, call me back ah."" WHO ARE YOU?! WHAT DO YOU WANT?!

Is the concept of stating your name, number, and maybe the reason for calling just... too advanced? When have we decided voicemails are just abstract performance art or is it simply stepping too much outside the NPC job description. 

Seriously, what’s the solution to protect my sanity? Do I need to start leaving instructions on my greeting? Please, enlighten me. thank you.

1k5twgq,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1k5twgq/pump_does_not_stop_running_ecm_mechanika_iv_profi/,Pump does not stop running [ECM MECHANIKA IV PROFI],"Hello, I am having problems with my ECM Mechanika IV Profi. For the last two days, when I turned the machine on in the morning, the pump would not stop running, the pressure gauge would go up to 8/10 bar and the water level in the tank would not go down. After turning the machine on and off a few times and opening the brew group, it finally stopped and was able to make coffee normally. 

Today, the same behaviour, but when making coffee, the pressure gauge did not go up and stayed at 2/3 bar, then the boiler pressure went up to 3 bar, I heard some steam, probably from the safety valve, and I immediately checked if the boiler was overfilled, which it was, as water was coming out of the steam wand. I did a stronger backflush with Cafiza a couple of weeks ago as I hadn't done it for a few months, if that makes any difference. 

I could check the water probe but I'm pretty sure it's not scaled, I think the problem might be with the GICAR or the solenoid valve. What would you suggest for troubleshooting? Is there anything else I should check?",1,1745396068.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
