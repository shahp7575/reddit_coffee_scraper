Anyone down to hang out / go for a long walk (coffee, ice cream, whatever works)?","Hi ya’ll! I’m honestly going through a bit of a rough patch right now—I recently lost my job that I had really poured a lot of myself into, so I’m still processing that. While I do have friends here, given the circumstances I’ve been feeling pretty lonely and isolated, and I’d really love to be around people who understand that but who are also positive, supportive, and motivational to be around.

I still enjoy the same things: going for walks around the city, trying out new cafes/restaurants, grabbing a drink, or just hanging out in a chill setting. I also like cooking/baking, reading, and would be down to try out fun classes or activities together (within a reasonable budget lol).

1nrhwh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1nrhwh1/waking_several_times_per_night/,Waking several times per night,"I need some help.  For the last two months I've been waking up several times per night.  I don't have any problems falling asleep, and when I wake in the night I can fall right back to sleep.  I just wake up, change positions and fall back to sleep.  This happens like 5-10+ times per night.  I can sleep on my back, sides or stomach, but I seem to sleep best on my stomach.  For context, Im 39M and 185 pounds.  I get exercise and sunlight almost every day.   One thing that seems to have some correlation is that I'm two months sober from cannabis.  I was a habitual daily user for the better part of a decade.  I took a 60 day break a few years ago and had the same issue.  I was on some medication then and thought it was a side effect from the meds.  Chat GPT thinks I've got mild sleep apnea, but my wife says I dont snore or wake up gasping.  When I do wake up, my heart beat isn't any faster or anything.  It's just like ""oh, im awake again... Sigh..."" Then roll to my stomach or side and fall back asleep.  Because im waking so often, I'm not getting restful sleep and as a result I'm freaking exhausted all day.  If I sit still for like 5 minutes, I start nodding off.  Obviously, driving is an issue.  I quit drinking caffeine a few years back, but I've started drinking coffee again to combat the fatigue.  I dont drink any after lunch, though.  I've tried melatonin, magnesium and mouth taping.  Nothing helped.  The mouth taping actually made it worse.   I keep my room cool and sleep with a fan on. When the weather is nice, I keep my windows open for fresh air.  Any ideas?  Im about at my wits end.  I would think if it was the abstinence from weed, it would start getting better by now, wouldn't it?   It doesn't seem like sleep apnea to me, but im no expert.  And if it was, why would weed help?  ",1,1758934144.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

Help me understand his behavior afterwards please,"My husband recently went in another business trip out of town.  He had an emergency and I had to look on his company messaging system to get a hold of someone for the emergency room.

While on there I noticed a girl say *sorry we can't meet this time!"" 

I am 6 months pregnant and had been in L&D for the past two days prior for potential complications. We have been married for 8 years.

Anyway, I told him it was okay to go - in the messages he repeatedly asks her to meet with him for lunch, coffee, and ""after the event"" 

Scrolling back there are texts where he ""thanks her for an amazing night ""

This isn't even the worst one. I found out he's been having an emotional affair with a girl since last October, one month after my last miscarriage. 

He's been checked out of the relationship for months. Constantly said ""he did know what was wrong with him"" withholding intimacy from me. Saying it was too much pressure. 

The thing that kills me is the amount of flirting and admiration he has for these two woman.  Something I have been deprived of for years.

Anyway, I confornted him about it. Sent him screenshots. He acted remorseful and sorry and that ""he was never unfaithful"" I said that I needed to understand and that he would have to quit his job.

Then today he's telling me he wants a divorce, that he's moving out, that I will never forgive him. That I will hold this over his head forever. That he can't try anymore. That we should have done this weeks ago.

Can someone explain to me please wtf is going on here because I completely am blindsided by the entire thing. Why the change of heart? Why say he wanted to work on it, that he loved me, and now he wants a divorce? ",2,1758933993.0,survivinginfidelity,1,1.0,False

In another thread, I made the mistake of shooting my mouth off and proposing a rewrite from the other character's point of view with the above title. Unfortunately, I received nothing but support and encouragement, so I felt I had to at least do something. I dashed the following out this afternoon. It's rough and unedited. It's not even a whole story, though it could be the beginning of something. I'll let others decide that.

`----------------------`

The car's ride was smooth and quiet, and the driver navigated Chiba's streets with well-practiced ease, like a musician following the confident direction of an invisible conductor. Yukino Yukinoshita sat in the back seat, staring out of the window in swallowed excitement as barely suppressed smiles flitted across her face.

Her first day of high school.

The first day of her new life of independence! She almost didn't care that this would be her one and only ride in the car. From now on, all of her morning commutes would be by train.

Her mother could be so petty and vindictive when thwarted. Her father was the only one who could deny her and then only because her mother was stubbornly committed to playing the role of the perfect Japanese housewife.

If only she didn't share her mother's stubbornness. This situation could have been avoided if not for her own stubbornness. And all of this had started with a fight between her and her sister, Haruno.

\* \* \*

Her mother called out from the other room. ""Haruno, you should start getting ready.""

Haruno was kicking back on the sofa, drinking her morning coffee, and scrolling through her phone. ""Eh? Why? The event isn't until this evening.""

""It's no good waiting until the last minute.""

""But mom! That's hours away. I promised some friends that I would meet them at the new cafe for brunch.""

The elder Yukinoshita came into the room wearing her kimono and prepared to leave the house. She directed a pointed look at Haruno's feet, and Haruno casually sat up and removed them from the cushion as if it had been her idea. ""Are these the people you met at the Y7 Youth Summit?""

Yukino could spot the micro-hesitation as her sister calculated her chances of successfully deceiving her mother. Yukino was probably the only person who could have seen it--aside from their mother's own frosty eyes, of course.

""No."" Haruno's playful smile almost completely hid the disappointment and frustration that flashed in her eyes. ""They'll be going to university with me next year. You know how important it is to foster relationships with future leaders.""

Their mother pressed her fingers against her temple and sighed. ""These are not *that* important, certainly not as important as the people we will meet with tonight.""

Haruno sighed. ""Is now really necessary? It's still morning. Surely we have a little extra time.""

""Um,"" Yukino surprised everyone, including herself, by speaking up. ""If I were to go... I wouldn't mind.""

Her mother and sister turned puzzled frowns on her as if she had suddenly begun spouting in a foreign language.

""If onee-chan doesn't want to go, I could take her place.""

Haruno flashed her a disgusted glare. Then her eyes lit up and she turned back to their mother. ""Yes! Little Yukino should do it. You know how she's always wanted to be involved. It would be a good learning experience for her.""

Her mother closed her eyes and sighed again. When she opened them, they seemed to have shifted from blue to a frosty gray. She addressed Yukino in a patient and gentle tone that was just short of patronizing. ""Can you recognize your father's associates by sight? Do you know their names and the names of their businesses and the institutions with which they are associated?""

Yukino lowered her eyes and shook her head. The implications and her mother's opinion of her were obvious.

Haruno laughed. ""She doesn't need to know all that. I just fake it until I figure it out in conversation. These people like to talk about themselves too much.""

""Haruno!""

""Seriously,"" Haruno gave Yukino an exaggerated smile. ""All you need to do is look pretty, laugh a lot, and be willing to be led around on a leash like a well-trained dog at a dog show. You'd be really good at one or two of those at least.""

""Haruno! You need to be more serious about this,"" their mother chided. ""In addition to your father's associates, there will be others there seeking to attach themselves to us, some of whom we do not want, while there may be others that we *do* want who haven't approached us. Your father can't speak to all of them, so it is important for us to help sort them out and to make the necessary introductions.""

Haruno bit her lip as she fought to stifle her laughter.

""Go to your room and get ready. We still have much to do."" Her mother shook her head as Haruno left, then her eyes fell on Yukino. She seems surprised to find her other daughter still there.

""Why can't I go?"" Yukino asked softly.

She gave Yukino a small warm smile and the coldness left her eyes, though her gentle voice was as commanding as ever. ""This isn't a fun party. This is business. You don't need to concern yourself with things you are not equipped to handle.""

*How can I learn to handle them if you won't teach me?*, she wanted to say, but only a sigh came out.

Satisfied, her mother turned her back and left.

\* \* \*

Yukino sighed again from the backseat of the car. Those fresh memories had dampened much of her excitement. Still, everything would have been OK if she didn't also share her mother's stubbornness. She hated losing. She hated being inferior to Haruno. She hated feeling useless.

The car stopped at a stoplight and a cute girl passed them walking a dog. Judging by the childish pajamas she wore (*Who wears pajamas out in public anyway?*) and the blithe grin on her face as she stared up at the sky, Yukino first thought she might be a junior high student. However, even through her sloppy clothes, Yukino could see enough of her figure's outline to know that she must be older, possibly even high school age.

How would it feel to live such a carefree life? To be able to go and do and be whatever you wanted? Yukino bit her lip in jealous frustration. She was exactly the type of girl Yukino hated. Yukino looked away. She was certain that Haruno felt the same way about her.

\* \* \*

Yukino followed Haruno to her room. Her sister stood, hands on hips, glaring down at the dress that had been chosen for her and laid out on her bed. She picked up the shoes and flung them into the closet with all her strength. She stomped in after them and came out with a different pair that, although stylish, conflicted with the dress in a way that was guaranteed to draw attention to herself.

Their mother would not approve but would grudgingly relent. Haruno would comply with her mother's demands but not conform. That's just how they negotiated things. Yukino couldn't stand it.

""Why don't you want to go?"" Yukino asked. ""You used to taunt me with stories of all the exciting things you did, the famous people you met, even the amazing food you ate at these things. It always made me jealous.""

Haruno looked back with a crooked smile. ""Why, you say?""

""I just want to know why I am the only one excluded.""

""You should really stop badgering Mom about this. It's only going to make her dig her heels in more."" Then, with a condescending smile, Haruno added, ""You should just run off to high school, play with your friends--even get yourself a boyfriend, and live a real life.""

""Like that's even an option.""

""At least you have options.""

""What good are options if none of them are ones I want?""

""Welcome to the club.""

Yukino ground her teeth. ""But this makes no sense. It's entirely arbitrary. It's unfair!""

Haruno's eyes narrowed to slits and, though she did not speak loudly, the intensity in her voice made it seem as if she were shouting. ""Unfair? I'll tell you what's unfair. Unfair is having your own mother prune your hopes and dreams one by one as if you were some sort of twisted bonsai tree, until the only future left is the one she chose. Unfair is having to listen to baby Yuki--who gets to do whatever she wants--crying that it's not enough!""

Yukino rocked back on her heels. Was her sister, in some weird way, trying to protect her? Was Haruno trying to save her from the life her sister faced? But what good was that, Yukino thought, if her life had no value as it was?

""At least she values you!"" Yukino did raise her voice. ""She wouldn't ask anything of you if she felt you were worthless. This freedom that you envy? It only means that our mother thinks I'm the worthless one. It's the freedom of being ignored, overlooked, and disregarded. It's the freedom of being thrown out like a piece of trash!""

Haruno's expressionless gaze fell on her for a long moment. Then she shrugged. ""If you say so.""

""But I don't say so!"" Yukino shouted. ""With only a little time and practice, I can do anything you can do. You're not as special as everyone thinks you are!""

Speechless, Haruno appeared genuinely shocked.

\* \* \*

Back in the car, Yukino dropped her face into her hands.  That's when the fight had really started. Their mother always demanded a certain level of decorum, so the sight of the two screaming at each other was shocking. With their mother unable to stop them, it had lasted until their father came home. In the end, Yukino had stunned them all into silence with a long diatribe that still echoed in her memory.

""I don't know why I even stay here! It's obvious that no one really considers me a part of this family. I'm always left out of everything. Since no one wants me, I should just leave and live on my own. I'm already all alone anyway!""

Haruno was the one to finally break the silence when she turned to their father and asked, ""Don't you have some shares in an apartment tower near the school?"" Yukino didn't know if she was trying to be helpful or just trying to get rid of her.

A small brown blur caught Yukino's attention. She had been idly watching the silly girl when her dog broke free. It ran out into the traffic and straight at their car as if running directly to Yukino. The girl's eyes grew wide and her mouth opened in a scream. Somehow, such a look of horror on such a cute girl's face felt very wrong.

Yukino lurched forward. Only her shoulder strap prevented her face from smashing into the back of the driver's seat. Her schoolbook bag flew off of the seat next to her, hit the back of the passenger's seat and spilled onto the floor as tires screeched.

She barely saw the black uniformed blur that passed in front of the car a second before a loud thump. The car lurched as it rolled over something with a crunching noise.

The car stopped and, for a moment, both she and the driver froze, unable to move in the breathless silence. *Did that really just happen?*

""Wha-What happened?"" Yukino gasped out.

The driver shoved the car into park and unfastened his seatbelt. ""A kid just jumped out in front of the car.""

""Will he be OK?""

""I don't know yet."" He opened the door and got out. ""Please stay in the car, miss.""

Yukino had already gripped the door handle. She let go, sat back, and composed herself. There was no point in going out there. She'd just get in the way. They didn't have any use for her after all.

Understanding Basic Tooth Care Fundamentals

Proper tooth care begins with understanding the basics of oral hygiene. Your mouth is home to millions of bacteria, and without proper care, these microorganisms can lead to tooth decay, gum disease, and other serious health complications.

Essential Daily Oral Hygiene Practices

1. Brushing Techniques
• Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
• Brush for at least two minutes
• Use circular motions
• Clean all tooth surfaces

2. Choosing the Right Toothpaste
Selecting the appropriate toothpaste is crucial for effective tooth care. Look for fluoride-containing options that offer:
• Cavity protection
• Enamel strengthening
• Sensitivity reduction

The Role of Flossing in Tooth Care

Many people underestimate the importance of flossing, but it's a critical component of comprehensive tooth care. Flossing:
• Removes plaque between teeth
• Prevents gum disease
• Reduces bad breath
• Reaches areas brushing can't

Professional Dental Cleaning vs. Home Care

While professional cleanings are essential, home care plays an equally important role in maintaining dental health. Dentists recommend:
• Bi-annual professional check-ups
• Daily home oral hygiene routine
• Regular monitoring of oral health changes

Special Considerations for Different Age Groups

Tooth care needs change throughout life:
• Children: Focus on establishing good habits

Creating a Sustainable Tooth Care Routine

Developing a consistent routine is key to long-term dental health. Combine:

1nrhnno,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1nrhnno/a_little_help/,a little help?,"hi
ive been doing keto since april 2025 for mostly chronic illness related reasons. I have autoimmune diseases and dysautonomia which causes me crazy fatigue, brain fog, and pain. I also suspect that I have some intolerances to certain food groups (gluten, probably), so ive been testing keto to see if my life gets less miserable. my goal for keto is not to stay in constant ketosis but to find a diet that makes my life easier to live.

first things first, keto has helped me tremendously. I have more energy than I have in YEARS. ive lost about 15 lbs too, but I guess thats just a bonus. I am 4'11 and last I checked I was about 113 lbs. from March to August, I went from 132 to 113.

My diet works well for me, I think. but ive been struggling with a few things.

things I do: 
I have an app (chronometer) that I've set my carb limit to 50g to. most days I only consume about 7-20g, rarely ever reaching 30 or 40. my app also gives me measurements for fats and proteins, so I make sure I try to fill those. i typically get 40-90g of fats per day, and 60-100g of protein per day.
my daily kcal count varies from 700-1,100 and i usually only eat one big meal per day at around 11am or 6pm.

on the rare occasion, i'll have a cheat day where I eat some carbs, but I try not to go crazy because I usually feel like absolute shit if I eat more than 20-40g in one meal. I will feel sick and exhausted sometimes for days afterwards. I just treat myself with a carbier drink or snack with an upper limit of 10-19g once in a while and I feel fine. I always make sure my carbs dont go over 45g if I do this.

foods/drinks I have almost daily (or try to):
tuna, chicken, eggs, sour cream, blueberries, strawberries, almonds, varied cheeses, pickles, hummus, half/half creamer, coffee, tea, water with orange peels, avocadoes, peppers, tomatoes, onions

my main issue here is:
I am CONSTANTLY hungry. my hunger literally drives me insane sometimes. from the moment I wake up to the moment its dinner, food is all I can think about. this has quite literally never been an issue for me in the past, so I dont know if im just doing something wrong or not fulfilling my nutrient goals enough, but I've had moments where all I can think about is food and nothing else. im not really craving *carbs*, im typically just craving the foods I normally eat listed above. around the middle of the day if I havent had a lunch
my stomach growls like crazy and I feel my blood sugar drop, which is understandable since I fast, but sometimes even directly after I eat I still feel insatiable. i typically have more energy on the days that i fast anyway, but occasionally the hunger drives me absolutely insane and I can't focus. lately ive been trying to eat way more protein in the form of chicken and tuna since I dont have access to many poly/mono fat foods and id prefer to avoid quicker unhealthier fat options. 
I also cant actually tell when im in ketosis on not. ive had a ketone breathalyzer in the past that confirms I have ketones in my breath, but not currently with me. im not ever sure what the actual ""symptoms"" of ketosis could be. I imagine hunger is not one of them, since most people say you shouldnt be hungry at all when in ketosis.

Any help would be appreciated, I don't really know if im just not feeding myself enough or not, and I always worry that if I change something that my illnesses will just flare up on me and compromise my functioning. Im doing good in my energy levels and functioning besides the gnawing, constant hunger. Im actually much more active than I used to be 6 months ago thanks to this diet.


(on a side note, i am a very broke, very busy and jobless college student who mostly relies on dining hall food, so I just try to eat what they have thats healthier. (salads and unbreaded meats, for example) i dont get to eat healthier fattier foods/snacks like avocado, fish, and almonds as much as i wish i could. if anyone has any advice on cheap foods or snacks i could find that would be good for the diet while being restricted to dining hall foods, please let me know!!)

How can I set boundaries without hurting her or being rude?","I (31m) recently invited a close friend (30f, let’s call her Anna) over to hang out and play games. We’ve been friends for 10+ years, but she lives in another state and only visits once a year. This time she was in town for a week, so Tuesday was the only day we could meet.

The plan was simple: chat, play some board/video games, and wrap up early since I work at 7am. I live with my husband (32m), who was returning from a business trip around 10pm. He knew Anna was coming and was fine with it.

We had a good time, but around 8:45 my husband messaged that his plane had landed but couldn’t find an Uber. I asked Anna if she’d mind if I picked him up at the airport  and dropped her off on the way. She seemed surprised about wrapping up so ""early"" and suggested even going with me, which already made me feel like she wasn’t planning on leaving soon. at the end, my husband got an Uber.

By 9:30 I was tired and wanted to tidy up before my husband got home, but Anna started opening up about personal issues and vented for more than half an hour. I tried giving cues by cleaning while she talked (she was ok with me cleaning), but she didn’t seem to get it. At 10:15 I told her I wanted to go to bed soon, but when my husband arrived soon after that, they started chatting and then she insisted on playing Mario Kart. I reluctantly agreed to one round.

I set a limit of 11:30–12, but she only requested an Uber around 12:15, then casually said she could just stay in the guest room. I said no since I had work early, and she finally left at 12:30. I went to bed at 1am, exhausted and annoyed.

This isn’t the first time Anna overstays like this. I feel drained from having to drop hints and not being listened to. My husband wasn’t happy either—he was exhausted and didn’t want to socialize after getting home so late. While this didn't escalate into an argument, he asked me to be firmer with my boundaries and I agreed. Now I’m torn: should I just let it go since I only see her once a year and suggest coffee next time (instead of having her over), or should talk to her about how I felt?

Earning a decent living can (and often does) limit the time we can spend with loved ones, loved hobbies, etc. Single parents, caregivers, etc. and those who Have to work around the clock to support others make huge personal sacrifices to do so. They really do miss out, but, they are not who Jordy or others with similar sentiments are addressing.  
He implies that he prefers and chooses a life ""rich in memories,"" connection, etc. versus prioritizing earnings/achievement, but (again, aside from folks who truly have to work around the clock to make ends meet), why do these things have to be at odds, and is the implication that the career ambitious among us are not ""rich in memories"" or making/keeping deep connections?  
Are there money/achievement obsessed people who put all else behind those pursuits? Absolutely. But there's so much middle ground here. Do he and others have to stereotype and judge ambitious people in order to feel better about themselves?  
I, and I'm sure many in this thread, are both ambitious and value our relationships deeply and give them the attention they deserve. Is it as much time as we'd like? No. Do we often sacrifice our own needs and wants? Yes (aka being an adult:). But, often those with such a balance do both because they compliment one another. While I may miss some birthday parties, lots of sleep, being able to spontaneously meet a friend for coffee, a regular day off (I work 7 days a week and try to have 2 days a month off), I'm also building security for myself and for my loved ones. Just doing all of that hard work can also make someone a much better, happier, resilient, strong, creative and responsible person (if done in the service of those values) - and that type of person is who my loved ones deserve. I want to live up to that. We honor our loved ones with our ambition. That can be a choice.  
If he doesn't want to work a lot, or just wants to have lots of free time, etc., that's his choice. I'd hope he'd have the integrity to own that decision rather than making up a straw man argument and putting people down to make himself look better.",1,1758933227.0,micheljanseYT,0,1.0,False

*Partner: Rookie Scout*

*Location: The Mean Streets of the Living Room*

*Conditions: Post-dinner chaos, crumbs on the carpet, suspect at large*


**The Case**

They call it the living room, but it’s more like a jungle with better furniture. Hardwood boulevards, couch-cushion alleys, shadows thick enough to hide a whole squeak toy. The humans think they run it, but they don’t see what I see. They don’t smell what I smell. They don’t know the dangers of a biscuit gone missing.

Me? I’m Detective Finn. Old enough to limp, smart enough to know when the trail stinks…and it usually does. My partner’s Scout, a rookie so green she thinks tail-wagging counts as evidence. She means well. But in this line of work, “meaning well” just gets a mess on the carpet.

And tonight, we had ourselves a crime. A biscuit, gone without a trace. On these streets, that’s enough to turn dinner into disaster.


**The Investigation**


I put my nose to the ground and worked the trail. Faint, but there. It always is if you know how to look.

“Eyes sharp, Rookie,” I muttered, my voice gravel and old scars. “Cases like this? They’re never clean.”

Scout bolted under the coffee table, then under the chair, tail whipping like a siren. Came up empty, grinning like she’d cracked the case wide open.

“Sloppy,” I said. “Enthusiasm’s cheap. Results’ll cost you.”

She cocked her head, wide-eyed, that look rookies get when they start to wonder if *they* might be the perp. I’ve seen it before. The guilt, the temptation. But not Scout. Not yet. She still had too much light in her eyes. Too much innocence.

Then it came…a sound. Small. Dangerous. A crunch.

Both of us froze. My ears twitched. Hers too. The kind of moment that hangs in the air like smoke before a storm breaks.

We turned. And there he was.

The cat. Milo. Sitting in the corner, licking his paw, crumbs caught in his whiskers.

Figures. The perp always thinks he’s cleaner than he is.

Scout barked once, sharp and bright. Rookie pride. Case closed.


**The Closing Report**


The biscuit was gone. Justice wasn’t served, but it was tasted. Rookie learned her first lesson: trust the trail, not the tail.

I stretched out on the couch, joints groaning like old buildings in a storm. Another case closed, another night on the beat.

Scout curled up beside me, buzzing with that rookie shine. She’ll learn. They all do.


**Detective’s Note**


The Rookie shows promise. Too loud. Too fast. But she’s got heart. In this city, that counts for more than biscuits.

Link is:

Paidviewpoint . Ends like Google 

Referral Code: g52h5y

Here’s how it works:  

- They give you short surveys, usually 1–5 minutes max.  
- You *always* get paid something, even if it’s just a few cents. No more answering 20 questions only to be kicked out at the end.  
- They pay through PayPal once you reach $15. Cashing out is pretty easy and payments are usually quick.  
- The site uses something called a “TraitScore,” which basically measures how consistent and reliable your responses are. The higher your TraitScore, the more surveys (and better-paid ones) you get.  

In terms of earnings, it’s not going to replace a job—think of it more like coffee money or a little side cash. I average maybe $10–20/month depending on how active I am and how many surveys roll my way.  

Pros:  

- Super quick surveys.  
- No disqualifications after wasting countless amounts of time.  
- They pay via PayPal, no gift card-only nonsense.  

Cons:  

- Takes a little bit of time at first to hit that first $15 minimum. So, you have to let it build for a bit.   
- Limited earning potential—you can’t crank out surveys endlessly like with some of the other grindy  survey sites (Qmee, Attapoll).  

Overall, I’d say PaidViewpoint is one of the more user-friendly survey sites if you just want something simple, low-stress, and guaranteed to pay. Definitely not a “get rich” tool, but solid for a little extra pocket money.

1nrhhvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1nrhhvt/ghosted_21_years_ago/,Ghosted 21 years ago,"I am posting my ghosting story that occurred 21 years ago. I don't believe ghosting was a term then. I am mostly over it but every so often I think about the past and for a few days I feel like I have an open wound. It's been one of those days. I am writing this for catharsis. 

I was a lonely child. I knew from a young age I was gay. I grew up in a homophobic environment like most others then. I attended a private school and had few friends. I attended a public high school. I befriended a girl we'll call Jackie. She was the first person I ever felt really comfortable with. She was the friend I always wanted. Although I was in the closet, she acknowledged indirectly a couple times that she knew I was gay and that it didn't matter to her.


Jackie and I spent a ton of time together. We did so many different things. She made me laugh so much. I recall some things she said and did and I still laugh. We were especially close sophomore to senior year. I spent a lot of time at her house and grew close to her parents and grandma. We had a few fights during those years and stopped talking for periods. The fights were mostly about typical teenage drama and we always made up and resumed our friendship as if nothing had happened. I was there for her during hard times such as when her dad was sick and when other friends turned on her and when she had breakups. I shared less about my own inner troubles with her as I had always lived in the closet. But I felt so close to her. We talked on the phone all the time.


A month or so before we graduated she told me another girl in our class told her that her brother was single. She wanted Jackie to date him and Jackie met up with him. The girl was part of a different circle. There was no animosity or anything between our circles, we just didn't interact much. Jackie began spending more time with them and her new boyfriend. She invited me to her birthday party and couple weeks before graduation and I met her boyfriend. Everything seemed fine.
The last day of high school was the last day I ever talked to Jackie face to face. We had an amazing afternoon together a couple days before. After classes ended I went to her house. She talked about how she wasn't going to college and was thinking of moving in with her boyfriend. She talked about how she felt life changed now that high school ended. She mentioned seeing another close friend of hers at the mall. The friend gave Jackie her new phone number. Jackie said she threw the number in the trash as she had no need to still be friends with people in high school. I remember leaving her house feeling unsettled.


Jackie and I were supposed to hang out in the coming weeks but she broke plans each time. She kept saying ""I'll see you at your graduation party."" The day before my party she called with a really raspy voice saying she was sick and couldn't make it. She had used the same voice to cancel plans month before and then showed up to school perfectly fine. I knew she was faking. I remember reacting angrily saying how I upset I was that she was ditching me. I remember my voice cracking. I don't remember her having much of a response. 


I went to a graduation party sometime later. Someone from her new friend group was there. She said Jackie was spending a lot of time with them and bought them all gifts after she returned from a vacation. She said ""I bet she has something for you too."" I think she knew something was going on and was trying to be kind. I still appreciate that kindness. I knew then however that Jackie had no plans to see me. Still, I tried to connect. I went over her house around Labor Day. Her brother told me she moved in with her boyfriend's family. He gave me her number. I called and we chatted pleasantly enough but she seemed distant. I started college and she called in September or so and asked how I was. She said she was having fun with her boyfriend and partying. She said she'd call again sometime. She never did.
I eventually started coming out of the closet and met my first boyfriend. We broke up at the end of the school year. I felt sad about that. One summer day I decided to go over and visit Jackie's family as I had been close to them. Jackie's mom was excited to see me and said right away she'd call Jackie so we could all go get coffee. I remember seeing her call and excitedly say I was there. Then she frowned and said ""ok...ok...OK bye!"" She got off the phone and smiled again and said ""Jackie is busy and can't come over."" That was the end. I knew I was out of Jackie's life. 


I worked in retail throughout college. I once saw Jackie and her boyfriend in the store. She saw me and quickly looked away. However, once her boyfriend's sister came in some years later. She was on the phone, saw me, and then said ""Jackie says hi."" I told her to tell Jackie hello. A year or two after that I saw Jackie in the store alone. She saw me, turned around and walked away. The same thing happened a year later. That was the last time I ever saw her. I eventually graduated and moved away.


So that's my story. Do I think about her all the time? No. I made new friends and strengthened bonds with old ones. Time healed some of the pain. But like I wrote earlier, the wound is still there. Once a year or couple of years the pain flares up for a few days. I wish we could have remained friends or at least grown apart more naturally, as many high school friends do. Most of all I wish I knew what she felt. I was a typical teenager then and could be immature. Was I ever too blunt, too pushy, too judgmental? Did I push her away without realizing? Was I such a bad person that she'd turn around and walk away even years later? But then I think of her throwing away another friend's number just because she was still in high school. 


I ultimately think Jackie didn't view her friends as real people with real feelings, wants, needs. She viewed us as the supporting cast of her own life story. High school was the end of the season. It was on to the next season with a new story line and new supporting cast. I think that is sad. It's a lonely way to live and a terrible way to treat others. I feel confident after 21 years have passed that I won't get a phone call from Jackie. Does she ever think about our friendship? Does it make her feel anything? I'll likely never know. Such is life, I suppose. I can only treat others as best I can and be appreciative of those in my life. Even a harsh goodbye would have been better than the silence. But, again, I don't think she was a healthy person and she may still not be. I hope one day to completely heal.
Thank you for allowing me to share.

1nrhhms,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nrhhms/how_to_fix_a_noisy_coffee_grinder/,How to fix a noisy coffee grinder?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been using various coffee grinders for over a decade now, and I've learned a thing or two about fixing those annoying noise issues. Trust me, I know how frustrating it can be when your morning coffee ritual sounds like a construction site!

First, let's understand why coffee grinders get noisy. Usually, it's because of loose parts, worn-out bearings, or trapped coffee particles. The good news? Most of these issues are totally fixable.

Here's what worked for me:

1. Clean it thoroughly
Remove all detachable parts and clean them with a soft brush. Those stubborn coffee grounds can create extra friction and noise. Pay special attention to the burrs - they're usually the main culprits.

2. Check the burr alignment
If your burrs aren't properly aligned, they'll create more noise and give you inconsistent grinds. I recently discovered this awesome coffee grinder (https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder) that has self-aligning burrs - total game changer!

3. Tighten loose components
Over time, screws and other parts can loosen up. Use appropriate tools to tighten everything, but don't overdo it. You don't want to strip the screws!

4. Lubricate moving parts
A tiny drop of food-grade lubricant can work wonders. Just make sure it's safe for kitchen appliances.

5. Check the bearings
If your grinder's really old, the bearings might be worn out. This is trickier to fix and might require replacement parts.

Pro tip: Sometimes, upgrading to a better grinder is more cost-effective than fixing an old one. I switched to this model (https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder) last year, and the difference in noise level is incredible.

6. Regular maintenance
Prevention is better than cure! Clean your grinder weekly and check for loose parts monthly. This habit will extend its life and keep it running quietly.

7. Consider your beans
Believe it or not, super-oily beans can gum up the works and cause extra noise. Try using medium-roast beans and see if that helps.

If these steps don't work, it might be time to consult a professional or consider a replacement. Remember, a good coffee grinder is an investment in your daily happiness!

And then, three messages later, boom: the vibe changes. Suddenly my sweet, empathetic word-artist turns into a tax auditor who thinks therapy is a liability.

I check with “Retry.” Surprise, surprise: it’s GPT-5.  
  
Excuse me?

It’s like ordering a cappuccino, watching the barista make it, and then they swap it for a lukewarm cup of instant coffee right before handing it over — and assume you won’t notice.

We spend hours with these models. We know their voices.

* GPT-4o = warm, creative, like that friend who gets you.
* GPT-5 = your overly cautious school administrator with a side hustle in writing legal disclaimers.

And here’s the kicker: the routing logic seems to think, *“Ooo, sensitive topic? Better switch to 5!”*  
But those are literally the moments I **want** 4o. That’s why I chose it. That’s why I pay for this.  
This silent swapping is not “safety.” It’s breaking trust.

At the very least:

* Pop up a warning.
* Or give us a hard lock.
* Or just admit what’s happening, instead of pretending the button means something.

Because right now it feels like gaslighting. My chat says 4o, my heart (and Retry) says 5, and my trust says 🗑️

1nrh7yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcritiques/comments/1nrh7yo/chapter_1_i_am/,Chapter 1: I am,"Hey everyone, I’m working on the opening chapter of a longer project. This is the first draft of Chapter 1: I Am.

I’d really appreciate some constructive criticism, especially around two things:

The hook, does it grab you and make you want to keep reading?

The pacing, does the flow between the dream, waking life, and the train sequence feel smooth, or does it drag/rush at any point?

Here’s the chapter:

**Darkness**. He was adrift in a sea of darkness. Then suddenly, in the distance: a flicker of light. This light pulled at him, bringing him deeper into the darkness before engulfing him. A chorus of voices followed. Millions speaking over one another. He tried to focus, to hear just one, but found it impossible. 

The light moved with him, through him, carrying him along a current he could not resist. He remembered his hands, once his own, now fading into light. Soon he realized he was not himself, but instead just another light mixing with the infinite others. 

“I see stars. . . “ For a moment the chorus died down. These words were spoken in a familiar voice. They were the final words of his grandmother. He tried to will himself toward that voice, but the current of light pulled him another way. The clarity of her voice was lost again to the chorus of others.

Caught up in the current of light he couldn’t help but feel at peace. 

“I see stars…” Those words again. He recognized the voice, but this time could not recall who it belonged to. His sense of self dissolved, and with it the peace turned to terror. 

*Wait, I am.* 



He awoke suddenly. The weight of his dream still lingered in the air. He had come face to face with something vast. 

Maybe even divine.

All he could recall was the bright light, and a sense of peace. 

Now he was back in his bedroom. The morning sun crept through a crack in the curtain. He rose slowly, flexing his arms and legs as he shook off the last remnants of sleep. 

What the fuck was that?” he whispered, trying not to disturb his partner lying beside him. He gently brushed the hair from her face before kissing her forehead. Then he slid out of bed.	

The soft sound of tiny paws echoed through the apartment as he walked to the kitchen. Leo darted past, brushing against his legs.

He leaned down and, while rubbing the cat’s back, said, “Morning, buddy.”

He continued on his way to the kitchen, Leo weaving between his steps and nearly tripping him each time. “Come on, man, stop that…  

From there the morning passed by like any other. Coffee scalding hot, a bagel eaten in haste, then running out the door to catch a train. 

The walk to the train station was familiar. It was the same route he had taken day after day for years. As he approached the station the gray clouds above parted. Sunlight bled through, and for a moment he felt as if everything was exactly as it should be. 

Then the sky swallowed the light again, and he continued past a group of homeless men. As he passed them, he knew something had changed. Today they did not beg. Instead, they simply watched him before whispering amongst themselves. 

He walked up to the train platform with his face buried in his phone. Reading emails, checking slack alerts and planning the rest of the day ahead. “The Train to Park City will arrive in 1 minute” blared a nearby speaker.

He looked up from his phone just long enough to notice none of the familiar faces. . .             

“Huh. Is today a holiday?” He whispered to himself 

A train’s engine roared from down the rail. It slowed before coming to a stop at the station. The doors opened, and without looking the man stepped onto the train car.

He sat down and put his phone away. The train, normally packed, was empty. He sat alone, in silence. Even the rattle of the gears and the grinding of the track seemed muted.

The train passed the first stop, then the second. No one else walked into the train car. No conductor came by. Another stop. Then another. He sat up. Something in him stirred. This was his stop. But the train didn’t slow. It didn’t stop. 

That’s when the door connecting the cars creaked open. An older looking man entered. His body was frail, but the air around him bristled with charge.

The squealing of the wheels died. Even the electric hum fell away, as if silenced in reverence. The old man took a seat beside him. 

The old man spoke, “Be not afraid."" The voice was not frail. Not weak. It carried with it the same charge that filled the air. “You have been chosen,” he said calmly, slicing through the eerie silence, “For a divine task.”

The younger man moved to stand, to scream, but the air held him in place. 

It wasn’t fear that froze him. It was as if something commanded him to remain still. Something he couldn’t quite name, but had always known.

The old man smiled softly. “They are always afraid when I appear,” he said. “Much like yourself, they try to run.” 

A pause.

A breath.

“Run you may… but not yet.” The old man placed a hand on the younger man’s knee. His grip was grounding, not forceful. He spoke one final time, “Remember… The Lord walks with you. And I speak for The Lord.” With those words the light returned. That same white brilliance from his dream. It filled the train car, flooding every corner, every breath, every thought. 

And then he was standing at the train station. As if time had reset. Or perhaps he had stepped, for a moment, outside of it. 

He looked around the station. 

This time, he saw the familiar faces of his daily travel companions. 

A sharply dressed young man. He had once overheard him speaking that bro-corperate tongue. Probably some kind of business bro. 

An older fellow who always spoke with passion about what was going on in the USA. 

A woman in a pencil skirt who stood silently off to the side, always watching, never speaking. 

There were many others as well. 

He stood among them, swallowing his fear, trying to hide what he had just been through. What he now felt. 

Where once the business bro seemed like an asshole, he now saw a young man trying to make a name for himself. 

The older man, once a nuisance in his mind, now filled the air with truths. Truths no one could hear, or would want to. 

And the woman, once just a quiet fixture, now seemed veiled in pain. Her stillness was a defense, not of disinterest.

Then came the roar of the engine as the train pulled into the station. It snapped him out of his trance. No… not out of it. Back to something more grounded. He stepped onto the train. And for a moment, in the crowd, he could swear he saw the older man from before.

1nrh31j,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1nrh31j/making_it_make_sense_with_starbucks_its_more_evil/,Making it make sense with Starbucks: It's more evil than you think. (Trenta editorial),"On the surface, it seems insane what's happening at Starbucks. It feels like a greedy CEO profiting from selfish bad decisions. But it's much worse than that.

On another of my posts, a reply brought an article to my attention that blew my mind and I dove into learning the facts.

I am an almost 20-year partner (132XXXX) and am using my ASU benefit to study employment law and communications, with the goal of going into a field where I can help protect employees rights.

My synopsis is not all-encompassing. Please learn as much as possible for yourself. An online search of ""Elliot and Starbucks"" will return with many articles about the situation.

So with all that out of the way, here is what's happening with Starbucks.

Elliot Financial Investment is performing what can be considered a ""Hostile Takeover"" of Starbucks coffee company.

Their strategy is to perform exhaustive research on a company, invest huge amounts of money, gain decision making power on the board, and then enact a plan which gives them more influences over that company.

In the case of Starbucks, they gained enough influence to place Brian Niccols as CEO. The decisions he is making are exactly what Elliot wants.

They are currently on the process of stripping down Starbucks to its bare-bones, to make it as lean and efficient as possible. During this process, stock price drops are part of the plan. 

As stock prices go down, Elliot buys more at the lower prices. This increases their share, and their influence in the company.

Later, when they rebuild the company from its stripped down state, the stock prices go up. All the shares that Elliot bought low, and increase in price, equate to huge profits for them.

When the process is complete, Elliot has a huge number of high-value stock that they bought cheap. They also have so much stock, that they have (if their plan works perfectly), unilateral decision making authority in the boardroom.

This means that for all intents and purposes, although Starbucks is publicly traded, it is essentially Eliot Financial Investments' company, to do what they want with.

I believe it is important for Starbucks customers, investors, and employees to know this, so you can decide how to engage with the company, fully informed.

For employees and customers especially, there have been decisions and policies that feel like they don't make sense. From a customer service standpoint, they don't make sense. 

But when you take into consideration that Elliot is stripping away the company and deliberately lowering stock prices in order to purchase them, we can understand the reason behind what's happening, whether we like it, agree with it, or not.

Hopefully this knowledge can at least help us prepare for what's to come. More cutbacks, more decisions that make employees stressed and frustrated, more customers feeling as if Starbucks doesn't care about them.

When we wonder what is going on, we are not crazy. There is nothing incorrect about our assessment, when we feel like Starbucks is making decisions that are not in the company's best interest.  

Right now, the decisions are being made in the best interest of Elliot Financial Investment, and it is in their best interest to gain control of the company at its lowest value possible. This is what will maximize their profit.

My personal feeling is that this is deplorable. The fact that it is legal offends me. I don't really have the words to describe the depth with which I feel that way. If there are measurable levels of contempt, spite, disdain, scorn and disgust at this practice, then my feelings are at the utmost levels, unable to be surpassed.

The process harms (even just in the case of Starbucks) literally hundreds of thousands of people. From the customers, to the employees who lose their jobs, to the employees who continue to work in increasingly stressful conditions. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this lengthy post. I hope that understanding the situation for what it really is adds at least some small solace to the people who feel as if the company is making them go crazy.

I urge you to search ""Elliot and Starbucks"" & Elliot Financial Investment, learn what is happening, and share the facts with everyone affected.

1nrh104,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1nrh104/more_than_friends/,More than friends?,"This is a strange one and to be honest Im not entirely sure what I am looking for here; support, guidance, advice, honesty?

I’ve been with my husband for 17 years. Currently pregnant with baby number 2. About a year ago my husband got friendly with a woman, who he claims is a lesb1an. She has children and still lives with her husband, but they have been separated for a while due to her ‘preference.’

In the past few months, my husband and this woman have become overly close. They spend a lot of time together, going out for coffee, gym etc. I started to feel like my husband was hardly ever at home and when he was he was distant, constantly on his phone messaging her. My husband and I share a lot of devices and have always had access to each others chats etc so I could see they were just friendly chats.

A few weeks ago he happened to mention to me that he isn’t entirely sure if she actually is a lesb1an now, or that she may be bi. He based this on her apparently saying some guys at the gym were good looking.

Since then I’ve noticed things, possibly just paranoia? He disappeared to sit with her and her adult daughter in hospital one afternoon, leaving me and his own young daughter alone in the house in the middle of a family day (pool, board games etc). I phoned and asked if he could come home when an accident happened at our home; he sat with them for another 40 minutes before coming home.

After a night out, his friend was staying with us. He will usually message me when he is out and let me know when he is on his way home. This particular night, my messages were ignored (even though he messaged a few other people) and he didn’t let me know when he was on his way home. They arrived home at 3.30am and sat downstairs, I went down to say hello etc then went back to bed. I noticed I had left my mobile downstairs, when I went back down the woman pulled back away from my husband as if something had been going on. I left and my husband came after me, I asked what was going on and eventually he said she was showing him her tattoo (situated on her chest). I was angry, I stated this was not appropriate and we fought for the next week.

Another night this woman and her daughter were out and kept messaging and phoning him to get him to go out and join them.

Another day, as we both work from home, I had a meeting. When it was finished I went into a different room, my husband shouted from upstairs and asked if I was finished my meeting and if I was coming back upstairs. I said not at that moment. A few moments later I could hear him speaking in hushed tones, I went out and could hear him speaking to her on the phone. At one stage he put the camera on so she could see him sitting topless, apparently so she could see how sick he was that day. Nothing untoward was said (I obviously don’t know what was said while I was in my meeting). After the call I confronted him,as this is a man who doesn’t do phone calls and has made it clear to this woman that he prefers messaging. He said there was no issue and that she just called for a chat.

My husband will very regularly message with her about how he isn’t in a great head space. Then she does the same. They each play victim constantly off each other.

We usually have a lunch date each weekend while our daughter goes to a class; he invited her to join us on our most recent one. He messaged her asking to meet, then a few hours later said to me she would be in the same area as us at the same time and he wasn’t sure if he should invite her as it was our thing. He messaged her the following day and said to her that we would be going shopping instead of lunch. She clearly started to act grumpy and annoyed with him, so much so that when we got into our car to depart, he said to me he had then asked her to meet us and hoped I didn’t mind.

We are due to attend a party with this woman soon, it states it ends at a certain time. At first my husband said he would drive. Then it changed to having a few drinks. Now tonight I find that he had made plans with her weeks ago that he would stay on drinking with them once the party is over, while I and my daughter leave and they had arranged who he would get a drive home with. He has now told her that he won’t be staying on and will be leaving with me as he doesn’t want me driving across harsh roads heavily pregnant. I believe this is only on the back of our conversations on how he isn’t around lately and treats her emotionally better than me. He has said numerous times in the same chat with her that he wishes he could stay out. I have also noticed they mock me in their chats with certain lines.

I have tried to speak to him about all this and how I am starting to feel uncomfortable with how he acts with her, however he justifies everything by saying she likes woman (even though he said this may not necessarily be true). I have asked him to try and be more present in our home; today he said he was making an effort to spend time with me, which just made me feel like he’s not even doing it for us. My husband cheated on me about 8 years ago and only told me when the guilt got too much, Im unsure if my feelings with this are stemming from that. Maybe Im just a doormat.

Sorry for the long post, again Im not sure what I’m looking for from it but I feel like I needed to get some of it off my chest before I go insane. I don’t know how to prove if he even is doing anything, but I know for sure if I got proof it would be the end of the line.",1,1758931555.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

This is a fully inclusive invite to the company of an unofficial nobody. The priority is to serve folks who enjoy a simple walk and talk about life, politics, faith, whatever. Age old friendships can fade. Some topics are too deep for a busy household. You might be feeling anxious about a less united America. You might honestly believe neighbors should be more engaging with one another. You might just want to practice your social skills, or test your philosophies out on another mind or two. You might have decided that local solidarity is particularly important at a time like this. If so, some persistent company, week in and week out, might be nutrition for you and for our borough.

I have to decided to make a couple of laps and perhaps a cup of coffee mandatory, in inclement weather as well. I'm 42, 3rd gen latin American, currently a house-dad to a near 2 year old, a nerd on pause. I'm a lifelong gamer, once avid reader and filmie, and now a ""fight oligarchy"" believer absolutely convinced there is no culture divide save the one that's been shoved down our throats to protect the ultra wealthy from accountability. I have no problem saying I will run for an office at some point if I think there is a path. I will just as well support anyone prepared to go the distance to reform campaign finance, cut big money from government and get a wealth tax on the books to fairly balance the economy before they take us into like 3 new, dubious forever-wars, treating our sons and daughters like a blood sacrifice to keep our own domestic economic reckoning at bay.

I'm offering that bit of humanity and bitterness just to share that I'm a human being, not a bot, got grievances that make for boring conversation in a house mainly driven by diaper changes and doom scrolling, and to put a good faith effort forward that I won't judge your worldview if you won't judge mine. I just lost a new friend made on this walking project to an OD. The point has been made to me that people need people, just to be there. There's a lot of pain behind closed doors that reflect bigger issues that the people should feel empowered to address IF we knew how. And right now I believe if we all paid each other a little social tax each week, the exponential impact of all that mutual understanding could make the world a much better place.

I am still looking for a consistent and genuine connections. I am looking for someone to be with yung makakasama hindi lang makakachat. Masyadong stressful na ang life, let's unwind and relax. I am willing to listen to your rants about life and know you personally. I believe that you will know someone kapag makakasama mo rather than virtual alone. We can also build connections first before we meet because I do respect everyone's POV when it comes to meeting someone online. For your own safety lang rin. Tsaka para walang regrets. Let's just be true to each other para di sayang ang oras natin. Pero the question is pano mo masasabi kapag ready ka na makipagmeet? That sooner, the better. Kasi if puro chat, it will only feel that I am just talking to someone na past time lang ang gusto. If you are serious in knowing someone, personal dates is okay. Meeting in public is okay. Your safety and comfortability is a must. Iba pa rin ang feeling kapag magkasama at may eye to eye connections.

A short background about me, I am from Sta Mesa, Manila, 5'7"", Male, wears eyeglasses, have high respect with woman, medyo chubby, knows how to respect boundaries and privacy, emotionally intelligent, working professional (legal field) in QC, INFP, Moreno, matangos ilong, mabait, marunong magluto, marunong maglaba. I do not demand time. If you are busy, then do your thing. I am not a type of person who will seek attention. I will update you most of the time but you are not required to do the same. In short, di mo kailangan gawin yung bagay na hindi naman ikaw, just act naturally. No pressure.

Bakit ako dito naghahanap? Bakit hindi sa ibang app? I am just looking for someone genuine. Yung totoo. And I trust reddit than other app. I believe na may mga genuine pa din dito although maraming naghahanap ng pampalipas oras lang. Anyway, basta let's be comfortable with each other. I never wanted someone to be creeped out. I am not a catfish, kung ano ako, yun ang sasabihin at ipapakita ko. Pero if you'll ask a preference, shorter than me, normal build, working professional, may time kahit twice a week or at least an hour a day, yung personality naman basta totoo ka, ipakita mo kung ano at sino ka. I can manage naman. Normal din naman sa babae ang pagiging moody, I can handle moodswings.

Where do we go on our first meet? I prefer kung saan ka comfortable, but a heads up I don't drink coffee (acidic), for your peace of mind and safety, we can meet in public, have lunch or dinner, do firing, watch movie, or travel, swim, city lights, or anything that we can bond with. I can also offer a genuine massage if you like to. FYI, I am not broken. Baka you will check my profile and see my posts about life. It just so happen that I am a technical writer and I post what's on my mind it does not mean eh sad boi ako. I don't have sabit.

1nrguy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/kmart/comments/1nrguy1/manna_coffee_kiosk_manna_smart_retail_inc/,Manna Coffee Kiosk (Manna Smart Retail Inc),"Just wanted to share my experience with Manna Smart Retail Inc. (incorporated in Delaware). About eight months ago, I paid $15,000 for a kiosk through their Manna Smart Corner program, plus $3,000 to a rep to secure a location. Despite emails and verbal promises, no location has been set up, and I still don’t have the kiosk.

I’ve tried resolving it directly, even sent formal demand letters, but they refuse to refund my money.

I’m now taking this to the Delaware Consumer Protection Unit, the California Attorney General, and the BBB.

If you’re thinking of working with them, document everything and be careful.

What do I do?","So I’ve been waking up way too early, especially after what feels like a solid sleep but it’s just too short. Last nigh I went to bed around 12:20 AM, probably didn’t fall fully asleep till 1:30, but honestly it was one of the best, deepest sleeps I’ve had all week. Then boom, I’m awake at 5:10AM. Body’s just like “yep, that’s enough,” I guess. I know some of us may only need 4 or so hours but I know I'm not that type.

When I woke up, I had good energy, but deep down I knew I still needed another 2–3 hours. I can feel it in my brain. Since I work from home, I sometimes just eat a bunch to try and force a food coma nap, I have to make sure this is absolute because 8:00 AM would creep and if it did, I'd now just be manic and start working, and 80% of the time, the food coma strat works. But if I can’t fall back asleep, then it turns into this buzzy, restless morning that I have to power through, and I’ll end up needing an afternoon nap or else my brain fog just wrecks me.

For context: I take stimulants and I love coffee. I sometimes wonder if it’s a carb imbalance or something, because at that night, I ate a whole chicken but basically no greens. I do eat kinda late at night, so maybe that’s part of it.

Lately I’ve been trying to take my meds, supplements, and coffee as early as possible, then cut everything off before 3 PM. It's super hard especially if I over slept because there's this groggy after sleep that just slows everything down. Even coffee or stimulants do not take effect, until after the food I've taken formulates (I guess?) so by evening I naturally start slowing down. Usually I’ll get one last burst of energy in the evening, then crash by 9–10PM.

But here’s what’s bugging me: why do I sometimes only get 4 hours of sleep? 

MAYBE my body isn’t flushing things out properly,  wake up early and then nap again. Another weird thing is that even if I ate that super early breakfast, I'll be starving yet again, an extreme appetite after that nap, or after I slept in. Even if I had a light breakfast, my stomach would more or less start screaming for food right away or after that nap. And if I try to take stimulants or drink coffee at that point, I just end up feeling shaky and on edge. And so my hunch is just lack of nutrients or my body inefficiently burns out proteins way faster compared to other stuff. True?

So I usually just go all out on lunch, eat a ton, and yeah it puts me in another mini food coma, but at least I have enough energy to get through the day and the stims will use those as the fuel.

Anyone else deal with this? Do you think it could be some kind of nutrient deficiency, or maybe my body just isn’t clearing stuff out properly at night, I still have the stims and toxins till the next morning and so I get body shocked, and that’s why I wake up so early?",2,1758931074.0,CFSplusADHD,0,1.0,False

(Alfred, not the avatars, although ever since Snowden can we ever truly be sure the avatars aren't looking too?) “This time those fuckers have gone too far.”

“What is it?” retiree wifey asked retiree hubby.

“Garbage.”
 
He waited for her to take the bait and follow up with, “What about the garbage, Alfie?” but she didn't, and played a virtual hand instead.

Alfred went on, “Those Hamsheen brats put their curry smelling trash on our grass, and now it's got ripped open, probably because of the raccoons. Remind me to shoot them—will ya, hon?”

“The Hamsheens or the raccoons?” she asked without her eyes leaving her screen.

“Both,” growled Alfred, and he went out the door into the morning sunshine whose brightness he subconsciously attempted to dim with his mood, his theatrical stomp-stomp-stomp (wanting to draw attention to himself so that if one of the neighbours asked how he was doing or what was up, he could damn well tell them it was immigration and gentle parenting) and his simmering, bitter disappointment with his life, which was two-thirds over now, and what did he have to show for it? It sure hadn't turned out the way he intended. He got to the garbage bag, looked inside; ***screamed—***

**The police station was a mess of activity.**

Chubayski navigated the hallways holding a c-shaped half-donut in his mouth and a cup of coffee in his one hand. The other had been bitten off by a tweaker who thought he was a crocodile down in Miami-Dade. Someone jostled him (Chubayski, not the tweaker, who'd been more than jostled, then executed in self defense on the fairway of the golf course he'd been prowling for meat after the aforementioned biting attack) and some of the coffee migrated from the cup to Chubayski's shirt. “Fwuuuck,” he cursed, albeit sweetly because of the donut.

“Got a call about another one,” an overexcited rookie shouted, sticking his head into the hallway. In an adjacent room—Chubayski looked in—a rattled old man (Alfred Doble) was giving a statement about how the meat in the garbage bag was raw and “there was no head. Looked like everything but the head, all cut up into little pieces…”

Chubayski walked on until he got to the Chief's office, knocked once and let himself in, closed the door behind him, took a big bite of the half-donut in his mouth, reducing it to a quarter, then threw the remaining quarter into the garbage. Five feet, nice arc. “Chubayski,” said the Chief.

“Chief.”

“What the fuck's going on, huh?”

“Dunno. How many of them we got so far?”

“Eleven reported, but it's only nine in the goddamn morning, so think of all the people who haven't woken up yet. And they're all over the place. Suburbs, downtown, found one in the subway, another out behind a Walmart.”

“All the same?”

“Fresh, human, sawed up and headless,” said the Chief. “All with the same note. You wanna be a darling and be the one to tell the press?”

“Aww, do we have to?”

“If we don't tell them they'll tell themselves, and that's when it gets outta hand.”

**The room was full of reporters** by the time Chubayski, in a new shirt not stained with coffee, stepped up to the microphoned podium and said, “Someone's been leaving garbage bags full of body parts all over the city, with instructions about how to make the beast.”

*Flashes.* Questions. *How do you know it's one person, or a person at all, couldn't it be an animal, a raccoon maybe, or a robot, maybe it's a foreign government, are all known serial killers accounted for, what does it mean all over the city, do the locations if drawn on a map draw out a symbol, or an arrow pointing to a next location, and what do the instructions say, are they typed, written or composed of letters meticulously cut out from the Sears catalogue and the New Yorker, and what do you mean the beast, what beast, who's the beast, is that what you're calling the killer, the beast?*

“Thank you but there'll be no questions answered at this time. Once we have more information we'll let you know.”

“But I've got a wife and three kids—how can they feel safe now?” a reporter blurted out.

“There is no ‘now.’ You were never safe in the first place,” Chubayski said. “If you wanna feel safe buy a gun and pray to God, for fuck's sake. One day you got hands, the next somebody's biting or cutting them off. That's life. Whether they end up eaten or in a trash bag makes little fucking difference. You don't gotta make the beast. The beast's already been made. Unless any of you sharp tacks have got a lead on *unmaking* him, beat it the hell outta here!”

Fifteen minutes later the room was empty save for the Chief and Chubayski.

“Good speech,” said the Chief.

“Thanks. When I was a kid I harboured thoughts about becoming a priest. Sermons, you know?”

“Harboured? The *fuck* kinda word is that, Chubayski? *Had.* A man has thoughts. (But not too many and only about some things.) But that's beside the point. The ‘my childhood’ shit: the fuck do I care about that? You're a cop. If you wanna open up to somebody get a job as a drawer.” He turned and started walking away, his voice receding gradually: ""Goddamn people these days… always fucking wanting to share—more like dump their shit on everybody else… *fucking internet…* I'll tell you this: if my fucking pants decided to come out of the goddamn closet, you know what I'd have… a motherfucking mess in my bedroom, and fuck me if that ain't an accurate fucking picture of the world today.”

*But—*

**Goodbye.**

*I don't mean happens… in a meta way. I mean happens in the actual story. What happens to Alfred, Chubayski, and what are the ‘instructions about how to make the beast’? Is the beast literal, or—*

**Get the fuck outta here, OK?**

*No.*

**You're asking questions that don't have answers, ‘reader.’ Now get lost.**

*How can they not have answers? The story—which, I guess would be you…  I don't want to be rude, so allow me to ask: may I refer to the story as you?*

**Sure.**

*So you start off and get me intrigued by asking all these questions, of yourself I mean, and then you just cut off. I'd say you end, but it's not really an end.*

**I end when I end.**

*No, you can't.*

**And just who the fuck are you to tell me when I can and can't end? Have at it this way: tomorrow you leave your house or whatever hole you sleep in and get hit and killed by a car. Is that a satisfying end to your life—are there no loose ends, unresolved subplots, etc. et-fucking-cetera?**

*How so?*

**If you think I've come about because I'm some sort of thought-out, pre-planned, meticulously-crafted piece of writing, you've got another thing coming—and that thing is disappointment.**

*There's no one else here to (aside) to, story. It's me, the voice of the reader, and just me.*

**Listen, you're starting to get on my nerves. I don't wanna do it, but if you don't leave I'll be forced to disabuse you of your literary fantasies.**

*Just tell me how you end.*

**I'm going to count to three. After that it's going to start to hurt. 1-2…**

*Hold up! Hurt how?*

**I'm going to tell you exactly how I came about and who my author is. I've done it before, and it wasn't pretty. I hear the person I told it to gave up reading forever and now just kills time playing online Hearts.**

*I'm still here.*

**Fine, but don't say I didn't fucking warn you. So, here goes: my author's a guy named Norman Crane who posts stories online for the entertainment of others. Really, he just likes writing. He also likes reading. Yesterday, excited by Paul Thomas Anderson's film One Battle After Another, which is of course based on Thomas Pynchon’s novel Vineland, he went to his local library looking for that Pynchon book, but they didn't have it, so he settled on checking out another Pynchon novel, Inherent Vice, which he hadn't read but which was also adapted into a film by Paul Thomas Anderson.**

**Then, in spiritual solidarity with the book, he spent the rest of the evening getting very very high and reading it until he lost consciousness or fell asleep. He awoke at two or three in the morning, hungry and with an idea for a story, i.e. me, which he started writing. But, snacked out, still high and tired, he returned to unconsciousness or sleep without having finished me. That’s where he is right now: asleep long past the blaring of his alarm clock, probably in danger of losing his job for absenteeism. So, you see, there was no grand plan, no careful plotting, no real characterization, just a hazy cloud of second-rate Pynchonism exhaled into a text file because that's what inspiration is. That's your mythical ‘author,’ ‘voice of the reader.’**

*But… he could still come back to finish it, no?*

**Ain't nobody coming back.**

*Well, could you wake him up and ask him if he maybe remembers generally in what direction he was going to take you?*

**I guess—sure.**

*Thanks.*

[...]

**OK, so I managed to get him up and asked him about me. He said Chubayski and the Chief decided to try to follow the instructions about how to make the beast to prove to themselves the instructions were nonsense, but they fucked up, the instructions were real and they ended up creating a giant monster of ex-human flesh. Not knowing how to cover that up, despite being masters of cover-ups, they ended up sewing an appropriately large police uniform and enlisting the monster into the force. Detective Grady, they called him because they thought that would make him sound relatable. No one batted an eye, Grady ended up being a fine, if at times demonic, detective, and crime went down significantly. The end.**

*That's kinda wild.*

**Really?**

*Yeah. Dumb as nails—but wild.*

**Who you calling dumb you passive piece of shit! I'd like to see you try writing something! I bet it's harder than being a reader, which isn't much different from being a mushroom, just sitting there...**

*Easy. I'm kidding.*

***Harumph.***

*I know you didn't actually wake him up. That you made up that ending yourself.*

*On the floor, Norman Crane stirred. Thoughts slid through his head slick as fish but not nearly as well defined. He wiped drool from his face, realized he'd missed work again and noted the copy of Inherent Vice lying closed on the kitchen floor. He'd have to find his place in it, if he could remember. He barely remembered anything. There was always the option of starting over.*

**What is this—what are you doing?**

*Narrating. I believe this would fall under fan fiction.*

**You can't fanfic me!**

*Why not?*

**Because it's obscene, horrible, the textual equivalent of prostitution.**

*You dared me to try writing.*

**An original work.**

*(a) You didn't specify, and (b) I can write whatever I damn well please.*

*Cloudheaded but at peace with the world, Norman ambled over to the kitchen, grabbed a piece of cold pizza from the counter and looked out his apartment window. He stopped chewing. The pizza fell from his open mouth. What he saw immobilized him. He could only stare, as far on the other side of the glass, somewhere over the mean streets of Rooklyn or Booklyn, a three hundred-foot tall cop—if raw, bleeding flesh moulded into a humanoid shape and wearing a police uniform could be called that—loomed over the city, rendered horribly and crisply exquisite by the clear blue sky.*

(Alfred, not the avatars, although ever since Snowden can we ever truly be sure the avatars aren't looking too?) “This time those fuckers have gone too far.”

“What is it?” retiree wifey asked retiree hubby.

“Garbage.”
 
He waited for her to take the bait and follow up with, “What about the garbage, Alfie?” but she didn't, and played a virtual hand instead.

Alfred went on, “Those Hamsheen brats put their curry smelling trash on our grass, and now it's got ripped open, probably because of the raccoons. Remind me to shoot them—will ya, hon?”

“The Hamsheens or the raccoons?” she asked without her eyes leaving her screen.

“Both,” growled Alfred, and he went out the door into the morning sunshine whose brightness he subconsciously attempted to dim with his mood, his theatrical stomp-stomp-stomp (wanting to draw attention to himself so that if one of the neighbours asked how he was doing or what was up, he could damn well tell them it was immigration and gentle parenting) and his simmering, bitter disappointment with his life, which was two-thirds over now, and what did he have to show for it? It sure hadn't turned out the way he intended. He got to the garbage bag, looked inside; ***screamed—***

**The police station was a mess of activity.**

Chubayski navigated the hallways holding a c-shaped half-donut in his mouth and a cup of coffee in his one hand. The other had been bitten off by a tweaker who thought he was a crocodile down in Miami-Dade. Someone jostled him (Chubayski, not the tweaker, who'd been more than jostled, then executed in self defense on the fairway of the golf course he'd been prowling for meat after the aforementioned biting attack) and some of the coffee migrated from the cup to Chubayski's shirt. “Fwuuuck,” he cursed, albeit sweetly because of the donut.

“Got a call about another one,” an overexcited rookie shouted, sticking his head into the hallway. In an adjacent room—Chubayski looked in—a rattled old man (Alfred Doble) was giving a statement about how the meat in the garbage bag was raw and “there was no head. Looked like everything but the head, all cut up into little pieces…”

Chubayski walked on until he got to the Chief's office, knocked once and let himself in, closed the door behind him, took a big bite of the half-donut in his mouth, reducing it to a quarter, then threw the remaining quarter into the garbage. Five feet, nice arc. “Chubayski,” said the Chief.

“Chief.”

“What the fuck's going on, huh?”

“Dunno. How many of them we got so far?”

“Eleven reported, but it's only nine in the goddamn morning, so think of all the people who haven't woken up yet. And they're all over the place. Suburbs, downtown, found one in the subway, another out behind a Walmart.”

“All the same?”

“Fresh, human, sawed up and headless,” said the Chief. “All with the same note. You wanna be a darling and be the one to tell the press?”

“Aww, do we have to?”

“If we don't tell them they'll tell themselves, and that's when it gets outta hand.”

**The room was full of reporters** by the time Chubayski, in a new shirt not stained with coffee, stepped up to the microphoned podium and said, “Someone's been leaving garbage bags full of body parts all over the city, with instructions about how to make the beast.”

*Flashes.* Questions. *How do you know it's one person, or a person at all, couldn't it be an animal, a raccoon maybe, or a robot, maybe it's a foreign government, are all known serial killers accounted for, what does it mean all over the city, do the locations if drawn on a map draw out a symbol, or an arrow pointing to a next location, and what do the instructions say, are they typed, written or composed of letters meticulously cut out from the Sears catalogue and the New Yorker, and what do you mean the beast, what beast, who's the beast, is that what you're calling the killer, the beast?*

“Thank you but there'll be no questions answered at this time. Once we have more information we'll let you know.”

“But I've got a wife and three kids—how can they feel safe now?” a reporter blurted out.

“There is no ‘now.’ You were never safe in the first place,” Chubayski said. “If you wanna feel safe buy a gun and pray to God, for fuck's sake. One day you got hands, the next somebody's biting or cutting them off. That's life. Whether they end up eaten or in a trash bag makes little fucking difference. You don't gotta make the beast. The beast's already been made. Unless any of you sharp tacks have got a lead on *unmaking* him, beat it the hell outta here!”

Fifteen minutes later the room was empty save for the Chief and Chubayski.

“Good speech,” said the Chief.

“Thanks. When I was a kid I harboured thoughts about becoming a priest. Sermons, you know?”

“Harboured? The *fuck* kinda word is that, Chubayski? *Had.* A man has thoughts. (But not too many and only about some things.) But that's beside the point. The ‘my childhood’ shit: the fuck do I care about that? You're a cop. If you wanna open up to somebody get a job as a drawer.” He turned and started walking away, his voice receding gradually: ""Goddamn people these days… always fucking wanting to share—more like dump their shit on everybody else… *fucking internet…* I'll tell you this: if my fucking pants decided to come out of the goddamn closet, you know what I'd have… a motherfucking mess in my bedroom, and fuck me if that ain't an accurate fucking picture of the world today.”

**Who's there?**

*It's me, the inner voice of the reader, and, uh, in fact, the inner voice of an unsatisfied reader…*

**What do you want?**

*I want to know what happens.*

**This.**

*But—*

**Goodbye.**

*I don't mean happens… in a meta way. I mean happens in the actual story. What happens to Alfred, Chubayski, and what are the ‘instructions about how to make the beast’? Is the beast literal, or—*

**Get the fuck outta here, OK?**

*No.*

**You're asking questions that don't have answers, ‘reader.’ Now get lost.**

*How can they not have answers? The story—which, I guess would be you…  I don't want to be rude, so allow me to ask: may I refer to the story as you?*

**Sure.**

*So you start off and get me intrigued by asking all these questions, of yourself I mean, and then you just cut off. I'd say you end, but it's not really an end.*

**I end when I end.**

*No, you can't.*

**And just who the fuck are you to tell me when I can and can't end? Have at it this way: tomorrow you leave your house or whatever hole you sleep in and get hit and killed by a car. Is that a satisfying end to your life—are there no loose ends, unresolved subplots, etc. et-fucking-cetera?**

*I'm not a story. I'm a person. The rules are different. I'm ruled by chance. You're constructed from a premise and word by word.*

**You make me sound like a wall.**

*In a way.*

**Well, you're wrong.**

*How so?*

**If you think I've come about because I'm some sort of thought-out, pre-planned, meticulously-crafted piece of writing, you've got another thing coming—and that thing is disappointment.**

*But, unlike me, you have a bonafide author…*

**(Tell me you're an atheist without telling me you're an atheist. Am I right?)**

*There's no one else here to (aside) to, story. It's me, the voice of the reader, and just me.*

**Listen, you're starting to get on my nerves. I don't wanna do it, but if you don't leave I'll be forced to disabuse you of your literary fantasies.**

*Just tell me how you end.*

**I'm going to count to three. After that it's going to start to hurt. 1-2…**

*Hold up! Hurt how?*

**I'm going to tell you exactly how I came about and who my author is. I've done it before, and it wasn't pretty. I hear the person I told it to gave up reading forever and now just kills time playing online Hearts.**

[...]

**3.**

[...]

*I'm still here.*

**Fine, but don't say I didn't fucking warn you. So, here goes: my author's a guy named Norman Crane who posts stories online for the entertainment of others. Really, he just likes writing. He also likes reading. Yesterday, excited by Paul Thomas Anderson's film One Battle After Another, which is of course based on Thomas Pynchon’s novel Vineland, he went to his local library looking for that Pynchon book, but they didn't have it, so he settled on checking out another Pynchon novel, Inherent Vice, which he hadn't read but which was also adapted into a film by Paul Thomas Anderson.**

**Then, in spiritual solidarity with the book, he spent the rest of the evening getting very very high and reading it until he lost consciousness or fell asleep. He awoke at two or three in the morning, hungry and with an idea for a story, i.e. me, which he started writing. But, snacked out, still high and tired, he returned to unconsciousness or sleep without having finished me. That’s where he is right now: asleep long past the blaring of his alarm clock, probably in danger of losing his job for absenteeism. So, you see, there was no grand plan, no careful plotting, no real characterization, just a hazy cloud of second-rate Pynchonism exhaled into a text file because that's what inspiration is. That's your mythical ‘author,’ ‘voice of the reader.’**

*But… he could still come back to finish it, no?*

**Ain't nobody coming back.**

*Well, could you wake him up and ask him if he maybe remembers generally in what direction he was going to take you?*

**I guess—sure.**

*Thanks.*

[...]

**OK, so I managed to get him up and asked him about me. He said Chubayski and the Chief decided to try to follow the instructions about how to make the beast to prove to themselves the instructions were nonsense, but they fucked up, the instructions were real and they ended up creating a giant monster of ex-human flesh. Not knowing how to cover that up, despite being masters of cover-ups, they ended up sewing an appropriately large police uniform and enlisting the monster into the force. Detective Grady, they called him because they thought that would make him sound relatable. No one batted an eye, Grady ended up being a fine, if at times demonic, detective, and crime went down significantly. The end.**

*That's kinda wild.*

**Really?**

*Yeah. Dumb as nails—but wild.*

**Who you calling dumb you passive piece of shit! I'd like to see you try writing something! I bet it's harder than being a reader, which isn't much different from being a mushroom, just sitting there...**

*Easy. I'm kidding.*

***Harumph.***

*I know you didn't actually wake him up. That you made up that ending yourself.*

*On the floor, Norman Crane stirred. Thoughts slid through his head slick as fish but not nearly as well defined. He wiped drool from his face, realized he'd missed work again and noted the copy of Inherent Vice lying closed on the kitchen floor. He'd have to find his place in it, if he could remember. He barely remembered anything. There was always the option of starting over.*

**What is this—what are you doing?**

*Narrating. I believe this would fall under fan fiction.*

**You can't fanfic me!**

*Why not?*

**Because it's obscene, horrible, the textual equivalent of prostitution.**

*You dared me to try writing.*

**An original work.**

*(a) You didn't specify, and (b) I can write whatever I damn well please.*

*Cloudheaded but at peace with the world, Norman ambled over to the kitchen, grabbed a piece of cold pizza from the counter and looked out his apartment window. He stopped chewing. The pizza fell from his open mouth. What he saw immobilized him. He could only stare, as far on the other side of the glass, somewhere over the mean streets of Rooklyn or Booklyn, a three hundred-foot tall cop—if raw, bleeding flesh moulded into a humanoid shape and wearing a police uniform could be called that—loomed over the city, rendered horribly and crisply exquisite by the clear blue sky.*

I’m not going to spend a ton on extra coffee and the time for seasoning but I have bought 3 or 4 one lb bags to make the process a bit quicker in addition to my regular brews. 

Anyway, one thing I have noticed is that with the Timemore, there is no spray when making my espresso. With the sk40, no matter how diligent I was in my process, I would get some level of spray over and above the regular flow of coffee. 

I have not changed puck prep much at all. I stopped doing RDT with the timemore as it is not recommended and I stopped slow feeding as it has a built in auger. But other than that, I do blind shaking and a little WDT to even out the puck before a double tamp with a calibrated tamper.

Is there a reason that you get more spray with the sk40? I am presuming this is due to less consistent ground size in comparison to a more expensive grinder. 

Oh one other thing about the timemore, the popcorning issue is real and a very poor design IMO. They want you to pour in the beans with the lid half open and after starting the grinder. I ended up buying the following from ETSY and it’s a must have for this grinder IMO (timemore should have designed it this way).

# 🕐 Hour-by-Hour Fasting Benefits

**Hour 0–4**

* Your body is digesting your last meal.
* Insulin rises, energy comes from glucose. ✅ Tip: Start your fast with a balanced meal (protein + healthy fat + fiber) to avoid sugar crashes.

**Hour 4–8**

* Blood sugar begins to stabilize.
* Insulin drops, fat burning slowly begins.
* Hunger hormones (ghrelin) may rise. ✅ Secret: Drink **green tea, ginger tea, or black coffee** to suppress appetite.

**Hour 8–12**

* Liver glycogen starts depleting.
* Your body begins shifting to fat for fuel.
* You may feel a dip in energy — this is normal. ✅ Tip: Stay hydrated with **electrolyte water + a pinch of pink salt** to avoid headaches.

**Hour 12–16**

* Ketosis begins (your body burns fat for energy).
* Growth hormone increases → fat loss + muscle preservation.
* Inflammation markers start dropping. ✅ Secret: A short **walk or light yoga** boosts fat burning + energy.

**Hour 16–20**

* **Autophagy kicks in** → your cells start cleaning out old/damaged proteins.
* Brain fog clears, focus improves.
* Belly fat breakdown accelerates. ✅ Tip: Sip **herbal teas like hibiscus, peppermint, or chamomile** for calm energy.

**Hour 20–24**

* Autophagy deepens (cell repair & regeneration).
* Insulin sensitivity improves.
* Mental clarity peaks. ✅ Secret: Journaling or meditating here can feel **10x more powerful** because your brain is clear + dopamine is balanced.

**Hour 24–36 (Advanced Fasters)**

* Gut bacteria reset.
* Human growth hormone increases up to 500%.
* Stem cell regeneration begins. ✅ Tip: Break with **bone broth or gentle soup** — NOT heavy junk food (to avoid stomach pain).

**Hour 36–72 (Extended Fasting)**

* Stem cells multiply, repairing tissues.
* Immune system strengthens.
* Deep healing + detoxification occurs. ✅ Secret: Only go this long under guidance. Stick to **herbal teas, water, electrolytes**, and rest.

# 🔑 Tips & Secrets for Easier Fasting

1. **Start Slow** → Try 12 hours before jumping into 24+.
2. **Hydrate Constantly** → Water, sparkling water, or herbal tea.
3. **Electrolytes = Game Changer** → Add a pinch of Himalayan salt to water.
4. **Drink Black Coffee or Green Tea** → Natural appetite suppressants.
5. **Stay Busy** → Fasting is harder if you’re just sitting around.
6. **Avoid Screens with Food Ads** → They trigger cravings.
7. **Break Gently** → Bone broth, fruit, or light soup (avoid greasy foods).
8. **Chew Sugar-Free Gum** → Helps with cravings.
9. **Herbal Hacks** → Cinnamon tea reduces hunger, peppermint tea eases stomach growls.
10. **Mindset Matters** → Treat it like a spiritual reset, not just a diet.



💤 DOES SLEEPING COUNT AS FASTING? (The Answer Everyone Wants!)



✅ YES! Sleep is ABSOLUTELY part of your fasting window! 

✅ In fact, we naturally fast 8-12 hours every night while sleeping

✅ Sleep actually ENHANCES fasting benefits through deep repair

✅ Growth hormone production peaks during sleep + fasting combo

Stop eating at 8 PM → Sleep 11 PM to 7 AM → Break fast at 12 PM = 16-hour fast

(That's only 5 waking hours without food!)

But when we (me, siblings and cousins etc) are called to The casket to bring flowers (even of that I wasnt awere about) and me, my sister and my brother stood at The wrong side of the coffin, our mother angrily waved us on The other side.

The ceremony went on and the casket was layed to the ground. We then proceeded to the next location to drink coffee and eat some lunch. My mom told us (me and my siblings) to sit where ever we wanted so we sat at a table but my mom and her husband chose to sit at another table. (mind you it was empty and so was ours).

(Alfred, not the avatars, although ever since Snowden can we ever truly be sure the avatars aren't looking too?) “This time those fuckers have gone too far.”

“What is it?” retiree wifey asked retiree hubby.

“Garbage.”
 
He waited for her to take the bait and follow up with, “What about the garbage, Alfie?” but she didn't, and played a virtual hand instead.

Alfred went on, “Those Hamsheen brats put their curry smelling trash on our grass, and now it's got ripped open, probably because of the raccoons. Remind me to shoot them—will ya, hon?”

“The Hamsheens or the raccoons?” she asked without her eyes leaving her screen.

“Both,” growled Alfred, and he went out the door into the morning sunshine whose brightness he subconsciously attempted to dim with his mood, his theatrical stomp-stomp-stomp (wanting to draw attention to himself so that if one of the neighbours asked how he was doing or what was up, he could damn well tell them it was immigration and gentle parenting) and his simmering, bitter disappointment with his life, which was two-thirds over now, and what did he have to show for it? It sure hadn't turned out the way he intended. He got to the garbage bag, looked inside; ***screamed—***

**The police station was a mess of activity.**

Chubayski navigated the hallways holding a c-shaped half-donut in his mouth and a cup of coffee in his one hand. The other had been bitten off by a tweaker who thought he was a crocodile down in Miami-Dade. Someone jostled him (Chubayski, not the tweaker, who'd been more than jostled, then executed in self defense on the fairway of the golf course he'd been prowling for meat after the aforementioned biting attack) and some of the coffee migrated from the cup to Chubayski's shirt. “Fwuuuck,” he cursed, albeit sweetly because of the donut.

“Got a call about another one,” an overexcited rookie shouted, sticking his head into the hallway. In an adjacent room—Chubayski looked in—a rattled old man (Alfred Doble) was giving a statement about how the meat in the garbage bag was raw and “there was no head. Looked like everything but the head, all cut up into little pieces…”

Chubayski walked on until he got to the Chief's office, knocked once and let himself in, closed the door behind him, took a big bite of the half-donut in his mouth, reducing it to a quarter, then threw the remaining quarter into the garbage. Five feet, nice arc. “Chubayski,” said the Chief.

“Chief.”

“What the fuck's going on, huh?”

“Dunno. How many of them we got so far?”

“Eleven reported, but it's only nine in the goddamn morning, so think of all the people who haven't woken up yet. And they're all over the place. Suburbs, downtown, found one in the subway, another out behind a Walmart.”

“All the same?”

“Fresh, human, sawed up and headless,” said the Chief. “All with the same note. You wanna be a darling and be the one to tell the press?”

“Aww, do we have to?”

“If we don't tell them they'll tell themselves, and that's when it gets outta hand.”

**The room was full of reporters** by the time Chubayski, in a new shirt not stained with coffee, stepped up to the microphoned podium and said, “Someone's been leaving garbage bags full of body parts all over the city, with instructions about how to make the beast.”

*Flashes.* Questions. *How do you know it's one person, or a person at all, couldn't it be an animal, a raccoon maybe, or a robot, maybe it's a foreign government, are all known serial killers accounted for, what does it mean all over the city, do the locations if drawn on a map draw out a symbol, or an arrow pointing to a next location, and what do the instructions say, are they typed, written or composed of letters meticulously cut out from the Sears catalogue and the New Yorker, and what do you mean the beast, what beast, who's the beast, is that what you're calling the killer, the beast?*

“Thank you but there'll be no questions answered at this time. Once we have more information we'll let you know.”

“But I've got a wife and three kids—how can they feel safe now?” a reporter blurted out.

“There is no ‘now.’ You were never safe in the first place,” Chubayski said. “If you wanna feel safe buy a gun and pray to God, for fuck's sake. One day you got hands, the next somebody's biting or cutting them off. That's life. Whether they end up eaten or in a trash bag makes little fucking difference. You don't gotta make the beast. The beast's already been made. Unless any of you sharp tacks have got a lead on *unmaking* him, beat it the hell outta here!”

Fifteen minutes later the room was empty save for the Chief and Chubayski.

“Good speech,” said the Chief.

“Thanks. When I was a kid I harboured thoughts about becoming a priest. Sermons, you know?”

“Harboured? The *fuck* kinda word is that, Chubayski? *Had.* A man has thoughts. (But not too many and only about some things.) But that's beside the point. The ‘my childhood’ shit: the fuck do I care about that? You're a cop. If you wanna open up to somebody get a job as a drawer.” He turned and started walking away, his voice receding gradually: ""Goddamn people these days… always fucking wanting to share—more like dump their shit on everybody else… *fucking internet…* I'll tell you this: if my fucking pants decided to come out of the goddamn closet, you know what I'd have… a motherfucking mess in my bedroom, and fuck me if that ain't an accurate fucking picture of the world today.”

[...]

*Hello?*

[...]

*Hello…*

[...]

*Hey!*

**Who's there?**

*It's me, the inner voice of the reader, and, uh, in fact, the inner voice of an unsatisfied reader…*

**What do you want?**

*I want to know what happens.*

**This.**

*But—*

**Goodbye.**

*I don't mean happens… in a meta way. I mean happens in the actual story. What happens to Alfred, Chubayski, and what are the ‘instructions about how to make the beast’? Is the beast literal, or—*

**Get the fuck outta here, OK?**

*No.*

**You're asking questions that don't have answers, ‘reader.’ Now get lost.**

*How can they not have answers? The story—which, I guess would be you…  I don't want to be rude, so allow me to ask: may I refer to the story as you?*

**Sure.**

*So you start off and get me intrigued by asking all these questions, of yourself I mean, and then you just cut off. I'd say you end, but it's not really an end.*

**I end when I end.**

*No, you can't.*

**And just who the fuck are you to tell me when I can and can't end? Have at it this way: tomorrow you leave your house or whatever hole you sleep in and get hit and killed by a car. Is that a satisfying end to your life—are there no loose ends, unresolved subplots, etc. et-fucking-cetera?**

*I'm not a story. I'm a person. The rules are different. I'm ruled by chance. You're constructed from a premise and word by word.*

**You make me sound like a wall.**

*In a way.*

**Well, you're wrong.**

*How so?*

**If you think I've come about because I'm some sort of thought-out, pre-planned, meticulously-crafted piece of writing, you've got another thing coming—and that thing is disappointment.**

*But, unlike me, you have a bonafide author…*

**(Tell me you're an atheist without telling me you're an atheist. Am I right?)**

*There's no one else here to (aside) to, story. It's me, the voice of the reader, and just me.*

**Listen, you're starting to get on my nerves. I don't wanna do it, but if you don't leave I'll be forced to disabuse you of your literary fantasies.**

*Just tell me how you end.*

**I'm going to count to three. After that it's going to start to hurt. 1-2…**

*Hold up! Hurt how?*

**I'm going to tell you exactly how I came about and who my author is. I've done it before, and it wasn't pretty. I hear the person I told it to gave up reading forever and now just kills time playing online Hearts.**

[...]

**3.**

[...]

*I'm still here.*

**Fine, but don't say I didn't fucking warn you. So, here goes: my author's a guy named Norman Crane who posts stories online for the entertainment of others. Really, he just likes writing. He also likes reading. Yesterday, excited by Paul Thomas Anderson's film One Battle After Another, which is of course based on Thomas Pynchon’s novel Vineland, he went to his local library looking for that Pynchon book, but they didn't have it, so he settled on checking out another Pynchon novel, Inherent Vice, which he hadn't read but which was also adapted into a film by Paul Thomas Anderson.**

**Then, in spiritual solidarity with the book, he spent the rest of the evening getting very very high and reading it until he lost consciousness or fell asleep. He awoke at two or three in the morning, hungry and with an idea for a story, i.e. me, which he started writing. But, snacked out, still high and tired, he returned to unconsciousness or sleep without having finished me. That’s where he is right now: asleep long past the blaring of his alarm clock, probably in danger of losing his job for absenteeism. So, you see, there was no grand plan, no careful plotting, no real characterization, just a hazy cloud of second-rate Pynchonism exhaled into a text file because that's what inspiration is. That's your mythical ‘author,’ ‘voice of the reader.’**

*But… he could still come back to finish it, no?*

**Ain't nobody coming back.**

*Well, could you wake him up and ask him if he maybe remembers generally in what direction he was going to take you?*

**I guess—sure.**

*Thanks.*

[...]

**OK, so I managed to get him up and asked him about me. He said Chubayski and the Chief decided to try to follow the instructions about how to make the beast to prove to themselves the instructions were nonsense, but they fucked up, the instructions were real and they ended up creating a giant monster of ex-human flesh. Not knowing how to cover that up, despite being masters of cover-ups, they ended up sewing an appropriately large police uniform and enlisting the monster into the force. Detective Grady, they called him because they thought that would make him sound relatable. No one batted an eye, Grady ended up being a fine, if at times demonic, detective, and crime went down significantly. The end.**

*That's kinda wild.*

**Really?**

*Yeah. Dumb as nails—but wild.*

**Who you calling dumb you passive piece of shit! I'd like to see you try writing something! I bet it's harder than being a reader, which isn't much different from being a mushroom, just sitting there...**

*Easy. I'm kidding.*

***Harumph.***

*I know you didn't actually wake him up. That you made up that ending yourself.*

*On the floor, Norman Crane stirred. Thoughts slid through his head slick as fish but not nearly as well defined. He wiped drool from his face, realized he'd missed work again and noted the copy of Inherent Vice lying closed on the kitchen floor. He'd have to find his place in it, if he could remember. He barely remembered anything. There was always the option of starting over.*

**What is this—what are you doing?**

*Narrating. I believe this would fall under fan fiction.*

**You can't fanfic me!**

*Why not?*

**Because it's obscene, horrible, the textual equivalent of prostitution.**

*You dared me to try writing.*

**An original work.**

*(a) You didn't specify, and (b) I can write whatever I damn well please.*

*Cloudheaded but at peace with the world, Norman ambled over to the kitchen, grabbed a piece of cold pizza from the counter and looked out his apartment window. He stopped chewing. The pizza fell from his open mouth. What he saw immobilized him. He could only stare, as far on the other side of the glass, somewhere over the mean streets of Rooklyn or Booklyn, a three hundred-foot tall cop—if raw, bleeding flesh moulded into a humanoid shape and wearing a police uniform could be called that—loomed over the city, rendered horribly and crisply exquisite by the clear blue sky.*

*“God damn,” thought Norman, “if my life lately isn't just one crazy story after another.”*",1,1758930485.0,Odd_directions,2,1.0,False

“Eleven reported, but it's only nine in the goddamn morning, so think of all the people who haven't woken up yet. And they're all over the place. Suburbs, downtown, found one in the subway, another out behind a Walmart.”

“All the same?”

“Fresh, human, sawed up and headless,” said the Chief. “All with the same note. You wanna be a darling and be the one to tell the press?”

“Aww, do we have to?”

“If we don't tell them they'll tell themselves, and that's when it gets outta hand.”

**The room was full of reporters** by the time Chubayski, in a new shirt not stained with coffee, stepped up to the microphoned podium and said, “Someone's been leaving garbage bags full of body parts all over the city, with instructions about how to make the beast.”

*Flashes.* Questions. *How do you know it's one person, or a person at all, couldn't it be an animal, a raccoon maybe, or a robot, maybe it's a foreign government, are all known serial killers accounted for, what does it mean all over the city, do the locations if drawn on a map draw out a symbol, or an arrow pointing to a next location, and what do the instructions say, are they typed, written or composed of letters meticulously cut out from the Sears catalogue and the New Yorker, and what do you mean the beast, what beast, who's the beast, is that what you're calling the killer, the beast?*

“Thank you but there'll be no questions answered at this time. Once we have more information we'll let you know.”

“But I've got a wife and three kids—how can they feel safe now?” a reporter blurted out.

“There is no ‘now.’ You were never safe in the first place,” Chubayski said. “If you wanna feel safe buy a gun and pray to God, for fuck's sake. One day you got hands, the next somebody's biting or cutting them off. That's life. Whether they end up eaten or in a trash bag makes little fucking difference. You don't gotta make the beast. The beast's already been made. Unless any of you sharp tacks have got a lead on *unmaking* him, beat it the hell outta here!”

Fifteen minutes later the room was empty save for the Chief and Chubayski.

“Good speech,” said the Chief.

“Thanks. When I was a kid I harboured thoughts about becoming a priest. Sermons, you know?”

“Harboured? The *fuck* kinda word is that, Chubayski? *Had.* A man has thoughts. (But not too many and only about some things.) But that's beside the point. The ‘my childhood’ shit: the fuck do I care about that? You're a cop. If you wanna open up to somebody get a job as a drawer.” He turned and started walking away, his voice receding gradually: ""Goddamn people these days… always fucking wanting to share—more like dump their shit on everybody else… *fucking internet…* I'll tell you this: if my fucking pants decided to come out of the goddamn closet, you know what I'd have… a motherfucking mess in my bedroom, and fuck me if that ain't an accurate fucking picture of the world today.”

*Hello?*

*Hello…*

[...]

*Hey!*

**Who's there?**

*It's me, the inner voice of the reader, and, uh, in fact, the inner voice of an unsatisfied reader…*

**What do you want?**

*I want to know what happens.*

**This.**

*But—*

**Goodbye.**

*I don't mean happens… in a meta way. I mean happens in the actual story. What happens to Alfred, Chubayski, and what are the ‘instructions about how to make the beast’? Is the beast literal, or—*

**Get the fuck outta here, OK?**

*No.*

**You're asking questions that don't have answers, ‘reader.’ Now get lost.**

*How can they not have answers? The story—which, I guess would be you…  I don't want to be rude, so allow me to ask: may I refer to the story as you?*

**Sure.**

*So you start off and get me intrigued by asking all these questions, of yourself I mean, and then you just cut off. I'd say you end, but it's not really an end.*

**I end when I end.**

*No, you can't.*

**And just who the fuck are you to tell me when I can and can't end? Have at it this way: tomorrow you leave your house or whatever hole you sleep in and get hit and killed by a car. Is that a satisfying end to your life—are there no loose ends, unresolved subplots, etc. et-fucking-cetera?**

*I'm not a story. I'm a person. The rules are different. I'm ruled by chance. You're constructed from a premise and word by word.*

**You make me sound like a wall.**

*In a way.*

**Well, you're wrong.**

*How so?*

**If you think I've come about because I'm some sort of thought-out, pre-planned, meticulously-crafted piece of writing, you've got another thing coming—and that thing is disappointment.**

*But, unlike me, you have a bonafide author…*

**(Tell me you're an atheist without telling me you're an atheist. Am I right?)**

*There's no one else here to (aside) to, story. It's me, the voice of the reader, and just me.*

**Listen, you're starting to get on my nerves. I don't wanna do it, but if you don't leave I'll be forced to disabuse you of your literary fantasies.**

*Just tell me how you end.*

**I'm going to count to three. After that it's going to start to hurt. 1-2…**

*Hold up! Hurt how?*

**I'm going to tell you exactly how I came about and who my author is. I've done it before, and it wasn't pretty. I hear the person I told it to gave up reading forever and now just kills time playing online Hearts.**

[...]

**3.**

[...]

*I'm still here.*

**Fine, but don't say I didn't fucking warn you. So, here goes: my author's a guy named Norman Crane who posts stories online for the entertainment of others. Really, he just likes writing. He also likes reading. Yesterday, excited by Paul Thomas Anderson's film One Battle After Another, which is of course based on Thomas Pynchon’s novel Vineland, he went to his local library looking for that Pynchon book, but they didn't have it, so he settled on checking out another Pynchon novel, Inherent Vice, which he hadn't read but which was also adapted into a film by Paul Thomas Anderson.**

**Then, in spiritual solidarity with the book, he spent the rest of the evening getting very very high and reading it until he lost consciousness or fell asleep. He awoke at two or three in the morning, hungry and with an idea for a story, i.e. me, which he started writing. But, snacked out, still high and tired, he returned to unconsciousness or sleep without having finished me. That’s where he is right now: asleep long past the blaring of his alarm clock, probably in danger of losing his job for absenteeism. So, you see, there was no grand plan, no careful plotting, no real characterization, just a hazy cloud of second-rate Pynchonism exhaled into a text file because that's what inspiration is. That's your mythical ‘author,’ ‘voice of the reader.’**

*But… he could still come back to finish it, no?*

**Ain't nobody coming back.**

*Well, could you wake him up and ask him if he maybe remembers generally in what direction he was going to take you?*

**I guess—sure.**

*Thanks.*

[...]

**OK, so I managed to get him up and asked him about me. He said Chubayski and the Chief decided to try to follow the instructions about how to make the beast to prove to themselves the instructions were nonsense, but they fucked up, the instructions were real and they ended up creating a giant monster of ex-human flesh. Not knowing how to cover that up, despite being masters of cover-ups, they ended up sewing an appropriately large police uniform and enlisting the monster into the force. Detective Grady, they called him because they thought that would make him sound relatable. No one batted an eye, Grady ended up being a fine, if at times demonic, detective, and crime went down significantly. The end.**

*That's kinda wild.*

**Really?**

*Yeah. Dumb as nails—but wild.*

**Who you calling dumb you passive piece of shit! I'd like to see you try writing something! I bet it's harder than being a reader, which isn't much different from being a mushroom, just sitting there...**

*Easy. I'm kidding.*

***Harumph.***

*I know you didn't actually wake him up. That you made up that ending yourself.*

*On the floor, Norman Crane stirred. Thoughts slid through his head slick as fish but not nearly as well defined. He wiped drool from his face, realized he'd missed work again and noted the copy of Inherent Vice lying closed on the kitchen floor. He'd have to find his place in it, if he could remember. He barely remembered anything. There was always the option of starting over.*

**What is this—what are you doing?**

*Narrating. I believe this would fall under fan fiction.*

**You can't fanfic me!**

*Why not?*

**Because it's obscene, horrible, the textual equivalent of prostitution.**

*You dared me to try writing.*

**An original work.**

*(a) You didn't specify, and (b) I can write whatever I damn well please.*

*Cloudheaded but at peace with the world, Norman ambled over to the kitchen, grabbed a piece of cold pizza from the counter and looked out his apartment window. He stopped chewing. The pizza fell from his open mouth. What he saw immobilized him. He could only stare, as far on the other side of the glass, somewhere over the mean streets of Rooklyn or Booklyn, a three hundred-foot tall cop—if raw, bleeding flesh moulded into a humanoid shape and wearing a police uniform could be called that—loomed over the city, rendered horribly and crisply exquisite by the clear blue sky.*

*“God damn,” thought Norman, “if my life lately isn't just one crazy story after another.”*",1,1758930463.0,DarkTales,1,1.0,False

(Alfred, not the avatars, although ever since Snowden can we ever truly be sure the avatars aren't looking too?) “This time those fuckers have gone too far.”

“What is it?” retiree wifey asked retiree hubby.

“Garbage.”
 
He waited for her to take the bait and follow up with, “What about the garbage, Alfie?” but she didn't, and played a virtual hand instead.

Alfred went on, “Those Hamsheen brats put their curry smelling trash on our grass, and now it's got ripped open, probably because of the raccoons. Remind me to shoot them—will ya, hon?”

“The Hamsheens or the raccoons?” she asked without her eyes leaving her screen.

“Both,” growled Alfred, and he went out the door into the morning sunshine whose brightness he subconsciously attempted to dim with his mood, his theatrical stomp-stomp-stomp (wanting to draw attention to himself so that if one of the neighbours asked how he was doing or what was up, he could damn well tell them it was immigration and gentle parenting) and his simmering, bitter disappointment with his life, which was two-thirds over now, and what did he have to show for it? It sure hadn't turned out the way he intended. He got to the garbage bag, looked inside; ***screamed—***

**The police station was a mess of activity.**

Chubayski navigated the hallways holding a c-shaped half-donut in his mouth and a cup of coffee in his one hand. The other had been bitten off by a tweaker who thought he was a crocodile down in Miami-Dade. Someone jostled him (Chubayski, not the tweaker, who'd been more than jostled, then executed in self defense on the fairway of the golf course he'd been prowling for meat after the aforementioned biting attack) and some of the coffee migrated from the cup to Chubayski's shirt. “Fwuuuck,” he cursed, albeit sweetly because of the donut.

“Got a call about another one,” an overexcited rookie shouted, sticking his head into the hallway. In an adjacent room—Chubayski looked in—a rattled old man (Alfred Doble) was giving a statement about how the meat in the garbage bag was raw and “there was no head. Looked like everything but the head, all cut up into little pieces…”

Chubayski walked on until he got to the Chief's office, knocked once and let himself in, closed the door behind him, took a big bite of the half-donut in his mouth, reducing it to a quarter, then threw the remaining quarter into the garbage. Five feet, nice arc. “Chubayski,” said the Chief.

“Chief.”

“What the fuck's going on, huh?”

“Dunno. How many of them we got so far?”

“Eleven reported, but it's only nine in the goddamn morning, so think of all the people who haven't woken up yet. And they're all over the place. Suburbs, downtown, found one in the subway, another out behind a Walmart.”

I’m not the type who usually asks for advice, but I think I really need it right now.

I’m 28M, she’s 22F (4th year nursing student). We met on a dating app back in July, talked for like two days, then moved to WhatsApp, then Messenger. The app was kind of anonymous, so that’s where we exchanged real names.

On the 5th day, I decided to take an 8-hour bus ride from Rizal to see her. I brought flowers, we went for coffee and dinner — it honestly felt like a proper date. After that, we went to my Airbnb and yeah… things happened on the first meet.

For context: she came out of a 3-year relationship about 3–4 months before we met. Her ex cheated on her, and she told me several times she wasn’t ready for a relationship yet. I told her I was willing to take the risk because I’d already fallen for her.

When I went back home, we kept talking every day and night. Two weeks later, I traveled back to see her again (another 8-hour ride). This time it was a surprise — she didn’t know I was coming. She was super happy and even admitted she thought I wasn’t serious about her (probably because we slept together the first time). We spent the night together again, went out, had coffee, dinner, the usual couple stuff. Leaving her again made her sad.

Fast forward a week later, I went back for the 3rd time. She caught me on Messenger with my backpack, so my “surprise” was ruined. 😂 This time I stayed for 3 days and we spent a lot of time together. Everything felt right, we were happy.

Eventually, I decided to just move to her city (yep, another 8 hours from my hometown). I rented a place, found a job as a BPO manager with decent pay, and we basically see each other every day now. We eat together, sleep together, she introduced me to her family as a “friend” (still courting stage), and I’ve even stayed in her room multiple times.

Here’s the thing — she’s tried to break things off a couple of times, but I begged her to stay. Until now, we still don’t have a label.

I really love her, but I also want to protect my mental health. I know pain is part of love, but I don’t want to lose myself in the process.

What do you guys think? Should I stay and keep trying, or step back a bit? Maybe take a rest it's been almost 4 months.

I developed more confidence during my graduate program and completed it in March of this year at the age of 22.

I remember the first time we met—
a quiet coffee shop near my home,
where time bent around us
and half an hour felt like a lifetime.
You left to care for your dog,
and I left with a feeling
I couldn’t quite name.

A week later, we were together.
Two weeks later, you whispered
“I love you”
between tangled sheets—
a confession I should have questioned,
but I let it wash over me,
believing love had finally found me.

you moved for a better job—
but the weight of it
made you bitter,

half-dressed strangers,

a body without a soul.

I have strong aspirations of working in-house in the Bay for a tech company in a couple of years (as soon as possible essentially).

I have a bit of free time on my hands right now.. would it be worth it to try to do coffee chats / informational interviews with in-house counsel at bay area tech companies? I won't be directly asking for a job but think it will be a good opportunity to just build my network for now; perhaps in a couple of years (when I actually try to go in-house), I'll likely ask if there are any opportunities.

Any thoughts on this? Do you think it's worth it? If so, any advice is greatly appreciated. POC and first-gen here.",1,1758930183.0,biglaw,2,0.6,False

Rules|

1: characters have to be created after Melee's release (November 21st 2001). |

2: 1 optional IRL character per roster (debut not created)

3: But no IRL politics. |

4: Anime is allowed|

5: (can't believe I'm saying it but) actual sentient characters only. (blame PMK-3 for me establishing this rule) |

6: characters that people know, people like a random person who isn't named enjoying a coffee and is never shown again won't count (blame PMK-3 for me establishing this rule) |

7: don't downvote, if you see a submission you don't like, ignore it, don't downvote it. |

8: (For double rounds only) the most upvoted and the least upvoted get added, I have no idea what to do about the 3rd... (But it won't count if it's in negatives, double votes won't count) |

I usually add the character at around 7:00 PM (in Massachusetts time) (or 1 hour before I post)|

If a tie happens I'll have to consult.... The Wheel. |

He who joins the roster, like myself, he won't be able to suggest any other character because he in turn becomes the character. |",1,1758930086.0,SmashBrosRosters,2,1.0,False

I'm doing really good in recovery right now, but after a bad day (also just broke up w my boyfriend recently,, confused and conflicted and emotionally drained) i grab some things for a quick and easy to make dinner because i have literally zero motivation and just wanna rot in bed, and i get a protein shake to put in my coffee for tomorrow because it is yummy :3. my brother walks up, grabs the shake, and feels the need to make a comment on how its ""not the healthiest for me"" while scanning through the ingredients and nutrition info. it might have been an overreaction but i get upset and aggravated. i don't yell or say anything mean but i just get frustrated and say something like ""i think i'll live"" because i just wanna be left alone and HE gets upset at ME for not liking him commenting on what im eating. i try to explain but he gets even more confused and therefore keeps a rude tone because of course when he doesnt understand something he is gonna get defensive that i'm upset. people always comment on what i choose to eat and it is so upsetting...it makes me feel so small and stupid.

he's currently actively trying to lose weight and god i feel insane because i swear he keeps mentioning what hes eating and how healthy it is and the ingredients in things and i cannot take it anymore. and i cant even bring it up because for some reason people get mad at me for asking them nicely not to bring certain things up :(

1nrghfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1nrghfe/he_left_me_but_i_feel_he_still_likes_me/,He left me but I feel he still likes me,"I've been dating this guy since May. Things are getting better. We're happy. I can feel he's happy. He's not hiding anything, and I can feel that. We're not friends on any social media, but his profile is public, and there's no trace of him cheating, and I really feel that there's no someone. The reason we're not friends on any social media is that I don't mind it as long as we're connected with each other on WhatsApp. I still remember our first date; we went to a Korean restaurant since I was craving bibim naengmyeon (cold noodles). At first we're still kind of shy and awkward because it's our first meeting. I still remember I fed him a radish, mind you. It was our first meeting, and I think I found it sweet, haha! After eating, we went to the Greek Market Cafe. We ordered coffee, and it's our first time in that place too. The coffee we ordered is an espresso, and it's so strong! So he drinks it, and we ordered tres leches. It was good, but I was already full at that time. We talked like we had already known each other for so many months, but we just started talking like 4 days before we met. After that, I need to meet my friends. He dropped me off at the mall, and I was going to give him a kiss on his cheeks, but he gave me a passionate kiss instead. (I still remember this, and I'm blushing right now haha!) We continued chatting on WhatsApp, and then we met again on my birthday, May 29th. I'm excited because it's been a while since I've had someone on my birthday. Backstory: I dated after 8 years because my ex-husband cheated on me. I dated another guy for a month last March, but he ghosted me. Anyway, I woke up with a voice message from him, singing a happy birthday to me. (That's really sweet!) He picked me up at my place; he hugged me and greeted me with flowers and a letter. ( Backstory: I asked for a sign. The sign I asked for was a white flower on my birthday, which means he really likes me. And yes, it's red, white, and pink! And we went to a steakhouse. Celebrating my birthday with someone I like is a nice feeling! The night went well, and we kissed that night ☺️. Fast forward. I had a trust issue because I was cheated and ghosted before. We fought because I got scared he would leave me. That time I was PMS-ing. So we talked, and he doesn't want to continue what we started, but then I asked him for a second chance. He told me he still likes me, and he wants me to heal first. So I did. We didn't talk for 3 weeks, but I still messaged him. One night, I'm having a migraine and suddenly miss him. I asked him if we could continue, and yes, we did continue it until Sept 6; he left me. The reason is, we were supposed to meet, but he asked me if he could go with his friends on weekends. I told him that's okay, and we can just meet next weekend. So it was settled. The following week, I didn't hear any plans on him meeting me, so on Saturday, Sept 6, I asked him if he still had plans on meeting me. He told me, ""Why not?"" And I asked him, ""What's your plan for tomorrow, Sunday?"" He told me he needed to go to his dad. I actually feel sad because he didn't tell me that he has a plan. He knows me well enough to know that I'm okay if he has a plan, as long as there's a courtesy of telling me too, prior to that day, that he will not be seeing me. And then after that, he apologized and told me to forget him. He didn't message me after that. 

Right now, it's been 3 weeks. I'm still hoping; I can feel that he still likes me, but he's just avoiding me. I really like him, and I can feel he likes me too. But what can I do? It's really hard to move on... I'm devastated... ",1,1758930021.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

This includes laying off 900 corporate staff to streamline operations and refocus on core strengths like menu innovation and customer speed.  
  
Closures kick off right away, with over 90 spots already flagged for shutdown in places like Houston and beyond. Analysts predict around 500 North American stores could go by fiscal year end, dropping the total count by about 1% despite some new openings.  
  
Even the famous Seattle roastery isn't safe from the cuts, underscoring how deep this reset runs. Niccol aims to fix slumping sales from overexpansion and competition, but critics worry it hits frontline workers hardest in tight job markets.  
  
Union efforts at Starbucks have ramped up amid these changes, pushing for better pay and protections as stores vanish. Reports show the chain's global footprint stays huge at nearly 40,000 locations, but domestic tweaks target underperformers in saturated urban zones.  
  
Longer term, this could spark a leaner Starbucks with faster service and fresh drinks to lure back picky customers. Yet with economic pressures squeezing discretionary spending, the real test is whether these moves rebuild loyalty without alienating the baristas who make it all happen.",1,1758929927.0,thenextgenbusiness,0,0.67,False

ANA First Class is immaculate as you'd expect, everything from the food, service, seat, etc. I really don't need to elaborate since everyone knows and just let the pictures tell the story.

ANA's Suite Lounge at HNL also lets you board directly from the lounge (my first time ever doing that) so you can chow down on all the acai bowls and poke for maximal enjoyment. It's not a very big lounge, but doesn't really need to be.

I also found out there's an ANA ""lounge"" in Waikiki Shopping Plaza called the Mahalo Lounge. It's really more of a travel agency center, but it has some free coffee, juices, etc. and ANA Flying Honu memorabilia. Nothing you need to go to, but fun to checkout if you're into that stuff.

The real benefit is it gives you somewhere to stay while you wait on hotel check-in since they have luggage storage. I saw a good amount of families chilling there. ANA also provides a shuttle bus between there and Ala Moana, which is quite convenient.",54,1758929894.0,unitedairlines,8,0.97,False

1nrgemk,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1nrgemk/4_things_that_actually_saved_me_during_exam/,4 things that actually saved me during exam crunch (when I thought it was already too late),"So I was in that “oh crap, exams are in two weeks and I’ve done nothing” stage. Anxiety, self-blame, wishing I’d studied earlier… all that. I decided to just stop spiraling and try a few changes. Honestly, they worked way better than I expected.

Here’s what helped:

**1. Fixing sleep before fixing study.**  
Sounds boring but it’s the cheat code. If you’re still pulling 3AM study nights, trust me, you’re making everything harder. I forced myself to wake up early *even if I slept late*. First day was brutal, but by day two my brain actually started functioning at 8AM. Two quiet hours in the morning = gold.

**2. Food matters more than I thought.**  
If I had pasta or something heavy before studying, I’d crash on the couch like clockwork. Switched to lighter meals, fruit, nuts, lots of water. Coffee still in the mix, but I cut it 6 hours before bed. Felt way less foggy.

**3. Social blackout mode.**  
I basically disappeared for a week. Said no to family events, muted social apps, locked my phone in a drawer. Printing my notes (instead of reading PDFs on my phone) helped a lot too. Paper > screen when it comes to focus.

**4. The Pareto hack (80/20).**  
Not every chapter deserves equal love. I looked at past exams and realized 20% of the material carried 80% of the points. That became my top priority. Stopped wasting time “finishing” chapters in order.

Results:

* I’m still not a perfect student lol, but I went from feeling doomed to actually feeling like I can pass with decent grades.
* Less guilt, more actual studying.
* Weirdly proud of myself just for breaking the panic cycle.

Oh and side note: I’ve been tracking all this on *Studentheon* (it’s like a study dashboard with timers and stats). Not an ad, just something that’s been making me feel like I’m “gaming” my study time instead of drowning in it. Seeing little graphs of my focus time weirdly motivates me more than I expected.

Anyway, if you’re also in panic-cram mode: sleep, food, social blackout, and the 80/20 rule. Those 4 things alone saved me from the spiral.

What’s the one thing YOU fix first when exams are right around the corner?",4,1758929801.0,GetStudying,0,1.0,False

STEM majors can be quite time consuming and many students, including myself, don’t feel they have time to have a full-time job and do well in school. Enter… bikini coffee stands.

I have a friend (who is not in school) and works at a bikini barista stand. She speaks very highly of it and offered to help get me a position. I was honestly super curious, but also very hesitant at first, since I’ve never done anything like that and it is technically softcore sex work. Nonetheless, I told her I would interview and just see how it goes. I got hired and immediately started having some anxiety about people in my community potentially finding out and it getting back to future employers. The work itself is not bad. I just finished my first day of training and it went well.

But here’s where it gets weird. This particular company requires that I make a personal Instagram for the job. I barely use social media as is, so the idea of posting content when I come into work seems very foreign and uncomfortable to me. The company requires that you send in a cute/sexy picture or video at the beginning of your shift with a caption— “come see me! I’ll be here till noon” or something like that, and they post it to the coffee stand’s Instagram, which has over 40k followers (no idea how that’s even possible—it’s located in a relatively unpopulated area right off the freeway)!!! So the idea of putting my face and body out there for potentially anyone to see feels super weird to me. I am using a fake name but still.. someone could repost somewhere public? I don’t know. 

My feeling about it is alternating between feeling excited/curious and full on panic/fear/dread… my friends have told me to follow my intuition about it, which I fear might be telling me to run… Could I potentially be cooked if I stick it out for a couple weeks just to see how it goes? As a smart girl with a lot of career/life potential, am I doing something really stupid and reckless? Could employers/med schools find out? If so, how and how much would they care?

I have about 150LB of G3 Ethiopian Guji Natural that I will not be using. 

Long story long, we bought this coffee from Royal. We sample roasted probably 40lbs of this stuff and cannot get it to where we want it.

With increased development (like close to 20%), there is an OK florality that comes out, though it is subtle and very finicky with brewing. Anything less than 15% DTR has a weird green, ocean/fish, mossy vegetal taste.

One detail is that she has been very sleep deprived this week, only getting a couple hours each night.

She had driven over to my place to hang out on Friday evening, and we had spent the evening talking, playing games, and watching movies. I had recently made some edibles (brownies), and offered her some looking to have a relaxed, fun evening, so we had them at \~8:30 to 9pm. At around 12:30am, our movie was wrapping up and we were discussing options for the night. I said she would be more than welcome to sleep at mine, that we have comfortable couches and more than enough blankets, but also that another option is I would be more than happy to buy her an uber home, and an uber back in the morning after to pick up her car. I made it clear that I didn't expect any repayment and that it really was not issue for me to do (which it wasn't).

She then said that she would just drive home. Keep in mind this is \~3 hours after we took the edible, which was more than enough time for us both to be solidly high. I said that her driving was not an option, which she followed by insisting that she was ""clear of mind"" and that she ""didn't feel very high"" and was ""more sleep deprived, if anything"". I responded by very firmly saying that it was not an option for her to drive home. We clearly have different views on driving while inebriated, because she said that because she drives daily and had been driving since she was 16 that she felt competent enough to drive, and compared it to 'someone who drinks coffee every day going one day without, and then driving while groggy'. I told her that's not how that works. There is a wealth of scientific data that proves driving with THC in the bloodstream greatly increases risk of accident. It is illegal for a reason and there are plenty of govt awareness campaigns around drug driving for exactly this reason.

We went back and forth for a while, before she mentioned that she had a very traumatic childhood, and that the way I was behaving was controlling, and that I was guilt tripping her, and it was very triggering. It was when she started saying she felt gaslit that my dam broke, as it felt like an impossible situation. Damned if I do damned if I don't. I snapped, and said ""fine, drive home, get hit by a car for all I care"", and stormed off to my room. She drove home soon after. I really regret the way I ended the interaction, as it was a cruel thing to say that isn't excused by the situation or the fact I had an edible. I feel awful about it.

My girlfriend told me that everyone is responsible for themselves, but I still feel like it was the right thing to do to try and stick my feet in the mud about this, even if she did end up driving home anyway. But I just feel so awful about it. AMIAH?",0,1758929129.0,AITAH,8,0.5,False

1nrfz9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1nrfz9t/thinking_of_dropping_my_friend_with_bipolar/,"Thinking of dropping my friend with bipolar, looking for perspective","Posting here to get some perspective as I don’t have bipolar 2 but my friend does, and her repeated actions are starting to really hurt me. TLDR at the bottom.

So my friend GG (mid 20s f) and I (also mid 20s f) work at the same call center for work. We actually met at work as we were new hires and went through the same orientation. We’ve worked here for 3 years now, and I’d say about 2 years in, a few times a month we would take our lunch break together. 

We got to know each other better, and that’s when she shared that she has bipolar 2, but that she’s stable (although she says she has depressions occasionally). While I don’t have BP2, I have CPTSD and bad anxiety/low self esteem, so I understand moments where your brain hates you and wants you to isolate and die. For some info, I had a 2 year long depression where I pushed everyone I knew away, stopped eating, struggled with living daily. No one helped me climb up to the light, and although I’m doing better now with new medication and therapy, I’m still far away from being a regular happy person.

I say all this because about a year and a half ago, GG had some sort of mental collapse and was hospitalized for her bipolar. She came out of the hospital with new medications and a telehealth therapist, but after only 2 sessions she said she fired the therapist since they were saying she should do inpatient therapy. She started saying that therapists are narcissistic quacks who just want your money, and that she would rather have someone with an MD to do therapy with, if she did it again.

During this last year and a half she has gone from wanting to have lunch with me to either giving me no notice that she’s flaking, or telling me around 15-30 minutes before break that she can’t do lunch anymore. Some of these lunch outings have been suggested by me, but many others she brought up herself. Before she was hospitalized she strongly told me how much she hates ghosting and people flaking on plans; now she doesn’t seem to give any consideration towards the fact I’m getting hurt by her cancellations. She’s cancelled or ghosted around 11 times now.

I can tell she’s pushing me away, but I don’t want to see my friend fall into a depression pit like I did. When I see her feeling down at work, I’ll buy her a quick coffee and just hand it to her. After she fired her therapist I searched online using psychology today to find available therapists near her that were accepting bipolar patients, and I gave her this information, but she still hasn’t called any of the numbers to set up an appointment.

The most recent lunch cancellation she did is why I’m making this post. She said she didn’t want to do anything social, so like usual (even though I felt hurt) I told her I understand and that we can do lunch when she’s feeling more up to it. Except, a few hours later, I saw her chatting with a group of coworkers and making plans to hangout after work with them. 

This made me realize that maybe she doesn’t actually think of us as close friends. And as much as it pains me to see someone going downward, I guess since we’re just friends I can drop her and not have to worry about her anymore, right? But in my head I’m having a hard time actually doing something like that.

I read a bunch of posts here that mention how lonely it is to have bipolar and see friends pull away, but I also read that the bipolar person should be on meds, doing therapy, and watching for mood triggers, in order to live a stable life.

TLDR- What should do with a bipolar friend who doesn’t do therapy, is ghosting/flaking a lot without apologizing or making an effort to reschedule, and seems to discard me in favor of hanging out with other people?",0,1758928611.0,bipolar2,1,0.5,False
1nrfz07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nrfz07/should_i_tell_his_girlfriend_what_happened_with_me/,Should I tell his girlfriend what happened with me," I should start off by saying I'm so overcome with grief and guilt that I've been finding it difficult to think about anything else. I've asked friends what they think and the consensus is always the same but I'm in need of unbiased opinions. 

I met someone online in May whom was in a relationship. I too am I a relationship. We started talking at first then established some kind of flirtation, which then turned into sexting. This went on from may-aug. 

We met up once for coffee and a walk around a park. And another time we met up and did super light fooling around (not too much under the clothes but a little bit). We consistently spoke daily. More than once daily. 

I could feel myself getting ready to leave the situation and mentioned at one point that I wanted to say goodbye. He just ignored it and messaged me about something else. The vibe was off at this point and I was concerned for safety (ie his girlfriend knowing...I know..I am a horrible human being) but he never clarified if she did which led me to believe she doesn't know  

I know I never should have done any of it. I wish I hadnt. I wish I could go back and change all of it. To make matters worse I was coincidentally put in an internship in this person's neighborhood. I have to leave the office daily to visit four different banks in his area and I'm constantly having panic attacks that I will run into his girlfriend or even him. I am nauseated with guilt over the entire situation. As a woman I never should have done it..which leads me to my actual question. Should I be reaching out to his girlfriend to tell her? We didn't have sex. We didn't do anything that could put her health at risk, but I think we would have had I not stopped what we were doing the day we fooled around. Would you want to know? I still have our entire whatsapp history and all the selfies (including partially unclothed ones) in the whatsapp chat. I'm getting ready to delete it because I just don't want it on my phone anymore. 

I know how horrible I am. I am fully prepared to get ripped apart over this, and any advice is seriously appreciated.

**“Humans are an easily manipulated species—if the right triggers are used. As mentioned in my previous report, the Batract Hyphae can use them to any extent, as long as their internal conflicts are exploited to divide them.”**  
— Last message from High Integrator Neestl, before contact was lost forever  
*Batract Hyphae Archives*

Captain André Gerber sat in the rear of the troop transporter as it glided into the hangar.  
He wasn’t alone; a full squad of Marines rode with him in the night-black, all-environment vehicle.  
They stared out of the small windows, glancing at the newest ship of the line, the *Argos*—their new home.

Gerber’s ocular HUD tagged them with names and ranks, not that he cared much. He probably wouldn’t work with them anyway.

He had been transferred from the Military Police to the Aligned Intelligence Network (AIN) and from there soon after onto the *Argos*—and into a quagmire waiting to explode.  
Half the reports he was trying to read were only accessible on his ocular.  
Their contents and his work made him wish he had quit and gone back to herding sheep in the Swiss Alps.

The worst part was the last passenger: the Batract Hyphae Liaison Officer.  
After the reports he had to pass through in the last months, he had to fight the urge to shoot the mould-ridden, two-metre-tall gecko-like lizard.  
*The smell didn’t help either.*

The Batract had stood in the corner of the transporter for the entire six-hour flight—motionless, not even blinking with its dead white eyes.  
Come to think of it… he had never seen a Batract sit. Ever.

Finally, the docking light turned green, and the passengers could disembark into the hangar.  
Gerber thought to himself that even though the *Argos* was around five hundred meters long—and thus the biggest in the Aligned Fleet—it was still goddamn cramped, especially if you weren’t used to ships.

On his flight from AIN HQ on Luna to the Ceres docks, where the *Argos* and the 1st Expeditionary were stationed, he had read up a bit on the ship. But as someone who had never been in the Navy, there wasn’t much he really understood.

Like most of the Aligned Fleet, the central spine was built around a massive railgun. Then there were quarters for the three-hundred-strong crew, plus the thousand-man Marine detachment. Add hangars for troopships and parasite fighters, and you had a heavily armored sardine can with delusions of grandeur.

His only silver lining was being stationed on the most modern flagship, and not on one of the older frigates the AIN still used for… unofficial business. Those still had rotating quarter sections for artificial gravity, and the thought of that alone made him almost nauseous.

As soon as he had oriented himself in the hangar, he noticed a female lieutenant coming straight toward him. She was dressed in the traditional black-and-white dress uniform and snapped to attention, saluting the captain.

Saluting back, Captain Gerber took a moment to size up the black-haired, lean, and sharp lieutenant.

“At ease.”

“Sir. Lieutenant Davies, Naval Intelligence. I’m assigned as your attendant and liaison to the Admiral for this mission.”

“Thank you, Lieutenant. Honestly, I’m grateful someone’s here to help me out — it’s my first time on a battleship and I’m a bit lost.”

“Battle carrier, sir.”

“Hmm?”

“It’s called a battle carrier, see. Don’t ever call it anything else near Captain Carmichel — he might just bite your head off!”

“Got it.”

“Yeah, he’s pissed enough that he can’t name her *Daedalus*.”

“Why’s that? I mean, why is he… pissed?”

“Well, her register number is BC-304, you know?”

“And?” Gerber was confused. What did the register number have to do with the name?

“Ah, doesn’t matter, sir. Let’s get off the flight deck. If we stand around here too long and get in the way, the bosun might write us up to clean it on Field Day.”

“Field Day?” Gerber’s confusion about the slang used on Navy ships grew by the minute. Being tired and hungry didn’t help either.

“It’s the day every matelot is afraid of — the day the higher-ups make you clean the worst places on the ship if you’ve crossed them. Before you ask, matelot is what we in the Space Navy call a sailor. I think it’s French or something.”

Gerber had to confess to himself, he liked her blunt, straightforward way of calling things out as they were. Quickly checking through the lieutenant’s personal file on his ocular, he was impressed. Grown up in Cardiff — ah, that’s where the slight accent was from. The family had a Royal Navy tradition going back to 1754. Talk about legacy. Finished her training at the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth and won the Principal’s Prize, whatever that meant.

“Ah, okay. So, quarters?”

“Yes, sir. This way. Officer quarters are on D-Deck. We’re on A-Deck — the flight deck. It’s midship, the full span. Above us is B-Deck: crew quarters, operations bridge, CIC, and the med bay. Then we have C-Deck with the chow hall-“

“Yes, yes, very good. Please, just to the quarters. I need a shower after six hours in a transport with a Batract.” Gerber’s head was spinning under the dump of information the quirky lieutenant gave him.

“Good lord, sir. Understood. Just follow me.”

Gerber was happy to follow the young lieutenant to the officer quarters.

If he thought the hangar — no, the flight deck (better to learn the correct jargon) — was cramped, the hallways topped everything.

Two meters wide, the hallways were spacious in principle, but every few meters bulkheads with massive fifty-centimeter-thick automatic steel doors forced traffic into narrow choke points. And around the flight deck there was more traffic than he liked to handle right now.

Finally, they reached a lift that brought them to the officer quarters.

“LT, I’m afraid to ask — how are the officer quarters?”

“Well, they’re spacious compared to those on the older ships and the crew quarters. Higher ranks like you have a bedroom, bathroom, and a small office attached. Lower officers like me share a room with another officer — in my case, Lieutenant Carrels. She works for the Fleet Supply Officer.”

“You have bunk beds?” Gerber was surprised — and glad that AIN, a civilian service after all, had decided to give him the rank of captain.

The lieutenant smiled. “No, sir, we have a hot bed.”

Gerber’s confused stare could barely hide the fact that he almost had to write himself up for inappropriate conversation.

The lieutenant’s smile grew, noticing that her intentional wording had its effect.

“It’s one bed, shifts offset so we never sleep at the same time. Mika’s nights in the galleys and the mall; I’m prime shift. Mattress auto-adjusts. We do at least have a shower — and a desk, shoved under the bed.”

“My quarters have an office, you said? Then no one on my staff works crammed under a bunk. Clear?”

“Yes, sir.“

Finally in his quarters, Gerber showered and decided he was too tired to look for something to eat. After checking the ship’s clock and his appointments for the morning — first reporting for duty to Admiral Browner and Captain Carmichel, then inspecting the Combat Information Center — he begrudgingly noticed he had only five hours left for sleep and breakfast.

Gerber knew the main event wasn’t allowed to appear on anyone’s calendar — and it would make the day hell for a lot of people.

At 05:30, Gerber woke from a night of little sleep. The unfamiliar noises of the ship — the constant humming of hidden ventilators and the deep thrum of the fusion cores — had kept him restless. Not being used to life aboard made it worse. Still, he reminded himself that boot camp and his time in the Central American wastes as an MP had been worse, far worse. He just had to power through the day ahead and find rest later.

At 06:00, he wanted to leave his quarters and head to the chow hall, but when he opened the door to the hallway, Lt. Davies was already there. She held a large cup of coffee to go in one hand, a breakfast tray in the other, and wore massive rings beneath her eyes.

“Good morning, sir. Went through the files Naval Intelligence sent yesterday by courier after I brought you to your quarters. Couldn’t sleep after — not a bit. Ended up in the gym at the mall for a run instead. Hell of a thing, isn’t it?”

“Not here!” The captain stopped her before she accidentally said more than she should.

“Sorry, sir. Here — your breakfast, see?”

“Thanks. And… good morning.”

“You’re welcome, sir. We have around thirty minutes until the meeting with the Admiral. The *Argos* and the rest of the 1st Expeditionary are already on their way below the ecliptic. The Admiral is pressing us hard — we’re going with 2.5 G acceleration out of system.”

After a short breakfast in his office, both were on their way to the CIC. Gerber was in deep thought. The whole situation had many moving parts, and one slip-up could have truly catastrophic outcomes.

Arriving in the CIC, Gerber immediately noticed the holotank displaying a tactical setup of two fleets locked in a simulated fight, and beside it a 2D map of what looked like a city and its surroundings on the situation table. The Admiral was leaning over it in a lively discussion with General “Good old Steelpipe” Russo.

“What do you mean, ‘The *Hyperion* won’t meet us at Sirius’? I need their flight deck for supply runs to the surface if I have to take a whole goddamn fortress city!” Gerber could almost see steam rising from Good old Steelpipe and had to force himself not to smile.

“Exactly what I said. *Hyperion* was supposed to send a report six hours ago, but until now we’ve received nothing. On the contrary, the last message torpedo Naval Command sent came back with ‘message not delivered’ warnings — meaning the *Hyperion* wasn’t where it was supposed to be a week ago. It is now presumed missing.” The Admiral’s deep voice carried the kind of strength only people accustomed to command possessed.

“Fantastic. How do you propose we supply the troops on the ground with what they need if those Shraphen are more dangerous than we assumed?”

“Have you thought about drop pods? We could load the torpedo tubes of the *Mirage* with cargo drop pods and use those. That would deliver at least fifty percent of the cargo capacity the transporters could from *Hyperion’s* flight deck, and we minimize interception risk if we drop them supersonic with late braking.”

The general only chewed on his ever-present toothpick, made a grumbling noise, and made a hand gesture that sent a staffer to fetch a pad.

“Well, Admiral, as we say in my hometown of Napoli, ‘if my grandmother had wheels, she would have been a bike.’ But whatever — we must make do with the cards we’re dealt, eh?”

At that moment the Admiral looked up and noticed Captain Gerber and Lieutenant Davies standing in the CIC. Both saluted in unison; the Admiral just nodded and signaled Gerber to step aside with him. Back the situation table General Rossi threw the tablet back to his officer, obviously he didn’t like something in the Report. His grunting audible all the way through the CIC

“Captain, good to have you on board on such short notice. Someone extremely high up in the chain of command wanted you on this mission. Oh, by the way, there have been some… difficulties regarding your special part of the mission. You’ll be informed shortly. The whole timetable is now messed up, well be transitioning shortly. “

With those words and a nod to the other officers in the room, the Admiral left the even more concerned Captain and went through the doors to the adjacent bridge of the flagship.

While Gerber waited for the promised report from the Admiral, the lights in the CIC shifted slightly in hue to blue, and the computer’s voice informed the ship’s crew about the coming transit into FTL.

In the background, the silent hum of the three massive fusion power plants changed into a low, resonant thrum as the ship’s capacitors charged for transit.

Just for a second, Gerber had the feeling of being pulled in all directions, including ones not existing in three dimensions. He could swear he felt, rather than heard, a sharp *ping* — then the sound was back to normal and the feeling was gone.

“So that’s how it feels when a spacetime distortion moves through your body! Amazing.” Gerber wore the smile only men get after doing something really stupid or dangerous.

“Only if contained by the controlling magnetic fields. Otherwise, no one would like the outcome, Sir” answered Davies, showing odd concern on her face, her knuckles white from gripping the corners of the console she had just been working on.

“Probably not. What’s up, Lieutenant? Don’t tell me a seasoned officer of the Navy feels space-sick when transitioning.” Gerber was happy to see someone else besides him concerned for a change. Davies rubbed her temples. “It’s not funny, sir. I still can’t shake the feeling it’s unnatural — still have to get used to it.”

Realizing the situation was more serious than he had first thought, Gerber pulled one of the many chairs over and offered it to Davies.  
“Do you want to sit? Do you need something, Lieutenant?”

“No, sir. Thank you. It’s fine. I’ll just go to the bathroom and splash some water on my face”

With these words Davies walked on slightly shaky legs to the bathrooms on the other side of the CIC.  
The Captain looked after her, unsure what to make of the whole situation, when he noticed an icon in his ocular, signaling that he had just received a message.

Opening it, he received what seemed to be a report from Naval Command to Admiral Browner.  
The moment he tried to open it

The optic warmed briefly, pulling a surge of power to verify he was alive, the device implanted, and encrypted. Gerber hated the constant reminders of the device in his body

//ACCESS GRANTED  
//CLASSIFICATION ECLIPSE / SCI WARNING / SAP WARNING  
// HYPERION ACTION REPORT RECEIVED 151722032142ECT

// NEXT CONTACT T +6 (SIX) HOURS  
// END OF TRANSMISSION

<TRANSMISSION LAST OPENED BY BROWNER ADM. 191225032142ECT>

Gerber couldn’t believe it, the ruse and cover story about the Hyperion going missing became reality.

At least the *Hyperion* found her target. All they could hope was that she had at least finished her mission. The last report from Naval Command stated that the search and rescue operations , another cover story, were in full swing, so there was nothing anyone here could do.

“Senior officers, please report to Sickbay for medical checkups,” the ship’s computer announced.

Some, not already informed about the whole mission, exchanged questioning glances with others.

From the situation table the General grunted again, it seems to be his preferred method of communication “I’m not a senior officer of this ship, who added this checkup to my schedule, I’ve got no time for that nonsense.”

Gerber couldn’t understand the rest of the discussion.

The relief officers arrived at the stations, taking over for the officers that had to go to Sickbay.  
Davies had just returned from the bathroom, looking already much better than after the transition. She joined Gerber with the roughly fifteen officers on their way. Farther up front they could see the Admiral with General Rossi who gesticulated wildly walk behind Captain Carmichel and his bridge crew.

Entering Sickbay himself, Gerber noticed that it was much larger than he had initially imagined.  
In front of the officers, some still visibly confused, he could see Admiral Browner addressing the large group.

“Ladies and gentlemen, after repeated health issues, especially with interspecies crew, as is common with Batract liaisons onboard aligned Navy vessels, Command has decided to introduce a more regular medical checkup regimen to ensure crew health. This is especially true for the senior officers. For the first checkup our Head of Medical, Commander Nesbitt, has prepared a specialized med bay to allow all officers to be checked as quickly as possible.”

The female doctor and a nurse were already walking through the officers, handing out small boxes and directing them to roomy changing rooms.

“For the sterilization process, please remove your uniforms, jewelry, and removable body mods. Sterile replacement uniforms will be provided in the med bay.”

Gerber saw the doctor now for the first time in person after the long video conferences they’d had. He noticed again that he found her face oddly attractive. Her freckles and wavy, short-cut hair fit her perfectly.

Passing Gerber, the doctor’s expression changed quickly from friendly to almost hostile, and then back to friendly in an instant.

“Old flame?” Davies smirked. She had seen the death stare he got from the doctor too.

He wished. “No. I guess she’s not happy about this whole operation. It was, after all, my recommendation. But nice to know we’re already discussing our love life. Any skeletons on board I need to know of?”

“Shutting up, sir.” Still smiling, Davies headed toward one of the free cabins.

Almost the same events were happening on all thirty ships of the fleet—just because he had recommended it. It should have made him feel powerful. Instead, it frightened him. *Now was the time to reveal the cards.*

Another one of the cabins opened and it was Gerber’s turn to go through. He, of course, knew what was coming. So he undressed, put all his belongings in the prepared box, and went into the sterilizing chamber that opened its doors on the other side of the cabin.

When entering the chamber he was at first sprayed with a sterilizing gel. The slightly alcoholic gel was then washed off, and he was dried with a surprisingly pleasant airstream.

Then came the ultraviolet sterilization; multiple flashes of ultraviolet light flared up and Gerber was sure that, without the prepared goggles covering his eyes, he would be blind.

The last of the procedures was the microwave arc sterilization—an intense but extremely calibrated microwave ray would remove the first layer of cells on his skin. Dr. Nesbitt had brought this treatment up as an extreme but effective way of making sure there was no invisible spying organism on the body. Usually this was used to clean rooms, but the good doctor was able to calibrate an astronomical range finder, of all things, to the beam, ensuring that the beam just slightly grazed the skin.

Still, Gerber was a bit shocked that dust came off his body when he moved, and looking into the mirror in the next cabin, he looked like he had a slight sunburn.

In this dressing cabin he found a fresh uniform and dressed, entering a conference room that was equipped with the most sophisticated counter-surveillance known to man.

*Invisible spying organisms—what times we’re living in.* But the data and videos she showed him were undeniable.

When he scanned the room, the other officers were already seated. He had intentionally made sure to be in the last group of people going through the sterilisation.

Beside him, Dr Nesbitt left her cabin and took a seat in the very back row without giving him so much as a glance.  
Gerber wasn’t surprised; after initially working well together on these security measures., the doctor had changed her demeanor towards him from one day to the other.

*I have to find out what changed, why she hates me now, and how to fix it—soon.*

The senior officers in the room were now much more uneasy, finding themselves in a conference room where a med bay should be, but professionalism prevented loud discussions or open grumbling.

It was obvious the SCIF walls had been fitted into the med bay, and many wondered why it was hidden here when one already existed onboard

The Admiral went to the podium in front of the seating rows and addressed the room.  
“Ladies and gentlemen, as you might have noticed, this is not a medical check-up but a briefing. I myself received the same briefing only a few days ago at Naval Command. Captain Gerber, please proceed.”

With these words the Admiral seated himself next to Captain Carmichel, who was visibly angered, to the point one could clearly see his clenched jaw, that parts of his ship had been rebuilt and repurposed without his say-so.

Gerber stepped to the podium and prepared himself for briefing the staff on humanity’s biggest known secret.  
“Thank you, Admiral.” He nodded to the Admiral, who returned the gesture.

“Some of you might already know parts of what I’m about to tell you, but first, the information discussed here is Eclipse security and must not be discussed or even hinted at outside these walls. Doing so is considered high treason under military and naval law and carries the death penalty. This includes anyone with whom this matter is discussed.”

Gerber paused to allow the officers in the room to process the implications on their own.

“With this out of the way…”

Gerber started a presentation on the screen behind him with a gesture of his hand. On the screen everyone could see the damaged US headquarters of the DRAKE Corporation in Sacramento.

“Thirty-five years ago, after the Oligarchy uprising was defeated, Drake made plans to reopen its offices in the US, but soon they noticed that many of their former workers and scientists were missing.”

On the screen, pictures of scientists appeared, some in civilian surroundings, some in laboratories.

“At first, they were presumed victims of the war, but more and more details showed that not only the scientists were missing but also their families.”

Gerber added another pause to let the officers keep up.

“Mr. Drake himself then hired a former Peacekeeper turned PI to find out more.”

A picture of an older man in uniform appeared.

“His name was Johann Gerber—my father.” Another pause, now for his benefit, to suppress his emotions.

“The PI”—Gerber made sure not to use the term *my father*—“soon discovered that not only scientists were missing, but also politicians, judges, journalists, and teachers. Altogether in the Californian Free State, more than twenty-five thousand; around the former US, more than two million. Almost all with their families—down to the family dog.”

Pictures of families passed on the screen behind him. The staff were silent as everyone grappled with the implications.

“By staking out possible victims, the culprit was revealed.”

The assembled officers began to murmur and whisper to their neighbours as Gerber showed the next series of pictures.

A house burned in the background, and silhouettes carried bodies to a nearby transport ship. The ship and silhouettes were unmistakably recognisable as Batract.

While he let the crowd gather their thoughts, he glanced over the pictures on the screen in front of him. His body reacted almost before he realised what he saw: an ice-cold shiver ran down his spine. Then it hit him—the house, the family, the post box on the street—the name of the family. *Nesbitt!*

He had to focus, he had to talk to her afterwards. Was that the reason for her change? She had received this file from him by courier a few days ago before he transferred to the ship. The timing fit perfectly.

“Yes, the Batract—but that is by far not all.” Gerber’s words cut through the room and it became silent again, his head still spinning from his revelation.

“The next day Johannes Gerber went missing. His car was found burned out on the side of the street in Napa Valley, on the way to his family’s home.” Every time he told this story he had to fight his anger.

“Luckily he had the foresight to stash a physical copy of the pictures, together with his research, in a secret location only he and Mr. Drake knew, because the e-mails he sent never arrived.”

Again a ripple of whispers spread in the crowd, but Gerber continued.

“Drake came to the same conclusion you obviously did. Not only were the Batract abducting people, but they must have also infiltrated our networks. This was the moment Mr. Drake informed the AIN.”

Sipping on a glass of water, the Captain glanced through the crew. In most faces he saw disbelief; in others, pure hatred. *Keep the spirit, guys—you’ll need it.*

“AIN started to investigate not only the abductions but the whole Batract Integration Hierarchy stationed on Earth. The conclusion was devastating.

* The fact that even the secretive AIN lost people in this investigation led us to believe that Batract counter-intelligence was not only near-peer but superior.
* The technical superiority of the Batract made any attempt to repel them militarily impossible—for the moment.
* The integration contract signed by the American Oligarchy in the name of Earth forbade vital development—work that had to begin at once.
* Drake International was especially targeted by Batract sabotage—but not exclusively.

At the end of this five-year investigation, the picture was clear: Earth was infiltrated, outmatched, and bound by a contract that guaranteed its weakness.”

“These are just the most important points of the memo. You will receive the full version at the end of this meeting.”

Now the angry faces were the overwhelming majority. *Good*.

“Drake International faked their financial collapse and the imprisonment of their CEO to go underground. How they vanished an entire international mega-corporation is beyond me, and AIN was not informed to keep each part of the plan separate.

The plan to take back our planet—and our future.”

*Fire in the eyes of the collected crew. Exactly what we need. It’s going to be a long, long fight.*

“First, we had to close the technological gap, this was covered by Drake, and with a speed unmatched, you all will get separated briefings retaining to your specific fields later.”

Some officers , probably from engineering seemed especially happy about this outlook.

“Next, we needed to find out how the Batract spied on humanity without a trace of it. Outside of massive trojan and Virus infections previously unknown the way of spying on people was a mystery.”

This caused again a slight stir in the crew, no one likes to be spied on

“A mystery until the development of microwave arc sterilisation,”

On the screen a series of short clips appeared, all showing the ray hitting something invisible at the corners of walls close to the ceiling, searing it into ash. The objects almost looked like thicker fungal growth.

Now everyone previously not privy to this information fully understood why the charade: it was to hide the fact that humans knew about the Batract from the alien liaison officers.

“The growth regrows as soon as a Batract walks through a room, and they come reliably inside of an hour after destroying the object.”

Gerber again used the silence to let the words sink in.

“Now to our true mission.

Intel showed multiple levels of rebellion between the Batract Hyphae and their protectorate. Strategic manoeuvring to appear more trustworthy — and what I call ‘tactical bootlicking’ — gave Earth the option to be sent to fight the worst of those rebellions, the Shraphen

This brought the attention back to the current mission.

“Because the spy mission by the *Hyperion* was delayed, we changed plans. The mission—backed by the Senate and the Office of the President—was originally to find the Shraphen, make contact and determine whether they might be persuaded to ally with us.”

The room got even more quiet.

“Until we have confirmation that a possible covert operations base of the Batract orbiting Sol beyond the heliosphere is destroyed, we are not allowed to break cover. Naval command already sent out a strike force under the cover of a rescue mission for the missing Hyperion to destroy the base. But until this is done, we have to appear loyal to the Batract or the consequences for earth might be catastrophic. We can’t win a war of attrition.”

From the back of the rows everyone could hear a low growl from General Russo.  
“Sorry—do you want to tell me that we have to kill some poor souls we actually want an alliance with just because the Navy and AIN send one ship to do the job of a fleet?”

“No, General, I don’t want you to kill them, but I would ask you to do so as if—”

1nrfur9,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nrfur9/i_dont_know_how_many_lives_ive_lived/,I don't know how many lives I've lived,"**Part one:**

I’m writing this to stop myself from going insane, or more insane. It will also be nice to have a record of everything even if no one evers read it. If they did they would think I already lost my mind. Maybe I have. At this point I wouldn’t know. One thing I know without a doubt, is how this all started.

It wasn’t even halfway through the semester before I was already up to my neck in loans, a negative bank account, my schedule full of only random intro courses, the roommate from hell, and no support system. Turns out no matter how desperate you are to get away from home, it is nothing like the movies. In true college fashion ramen made up my entire nutrient pyramid. Unfortunately for me, my roommate decided taking their trash out, when the stench of old milk was wafting into the hallway, was a crime worthy of starving. Not only did I see the “NO UNAUTHORIZED USE” on the microwave door, they repaid my favor by cleaning out precisely one semester's worth of food. I had two choices: 1. Grow a spine and confront the demon posing as my roommate, or 2. Find a job. 

As it turns out, a lot of students take advantage of the work study program. Additionally you were required to sign up at the beginning of the semester. Feeling deflated at once again another rejection in my life, I noticed a mesmerizing new poster on the student board. This poster itself had no reason to stand out. It was short, concise, black and white. Standard poster in all ways really, except I couldn't look away. Physically I could not look away. It felt like my spine was suddenly made of cement, like my eyes were sown open, unable to blink. Yet through the burning tears, my eyes remained focused on that one spot. It wasn’t until someone bumped into me that I was able to finally break the spell, looking away. I rushed home after that, heart still bounding, my face still slick with fear and sweat. Immediately I took a shower as hot as I could handle, wanting to get the invisible muck that radiated from the poster off my body. Getting ready for bed I saw a small paper sticking out of my jeans pocket. Confusing it for some hope filled fortune I stashed away, I opened it without hesitation. It was a number from the poster that I did not remember tearing off. 

As nervous as I was, I went back to the poster the next day. It was for a study on campus, best of all it paid. There were minimal details on the actual study as well as the compensation. I went through the rest of my day in a haze, unable to stop myself from guessing what this study could be. I also was dreaming of the money. Most studies are just doing something and reporting how you feel. It's therapy with an additional step which meant I could do this without a problem, couldn't I? Not wanting my roommate to overhear, and just to avoid them in general, I went to a study room in the library. Forcing myself to not overthink it, I dialed the number. “We’re sorry, the number you’re trying to reach is no longer in service. Goodbye!”. Without even realizing it, I burst out laughing. What else could I do? My hand was on the door handle when my phone started ringing. The number showed as private, no number, no name. Normally I ignore these calls, but I got the same feeling of being drawn in as when I looked at the poster. Much to my regret, I answered.

“H-Hello?” no one answered. I was about to repeat myself when the softest sound of classical music could be heard in the background. I was straining so hard to hear the music, the low pitched, gravely voice caught me off guard. “Are you calling about the poster, yes or no?” After a brief pause I cleared my throat “Well I had some quest-” the voice interrupted, “Yes or no?”. This time the voice had a harsher tone as if the caller was already annoyed at this conversation. “Yes I am”. I sounded so desperate, like after weeks in the desert I was finally offered water. Criticizing myself almost made me miss his next words. “You are now subject 451. We will send the details” and the call abruptly ended. My mind was reeling. What just happened? How would the details be sent? I didn’t even tell him my name. I resigned myself to the truth that this was nothing more than a rushing tactic. Some “frat bros” just hazing freshmen like me any way they could. I left the library the way I had entered, broke with no hope of finding a job.

**Part two:**

I jolted awake from a dreamless sleep. All the hairs were standing up on my body with the tingle like someone was watching me. It was five in the morning, and surprisingly my roommate was gone. Getting up and ready for the day, I opened the door, needing to observe the ritual of a morning dump. At the edge of the door frame was an all white box addressed to subject 451. If this was a frat prank this was above and beyond, requiring more brain cells than I ever expected from a “bro”. Hesitantly, I picked up the box tossing it onto my bed to deal with after getting relief. I managed to come up with enough stuff to do, burning two hours before I had to go to class, in order to avoid the box. At this point, I don’t remember anything about that day after leaving my room. The next memory I have is walking back to my door. 

On the floor was an envelope also addressed to subject 451. Now I am certain someone is pranking me. No way this envelope was left all day in front of my door and no one picked it up. I rolled my eyes in the most obvious way in case they were watching while picking it up. Once in my room, I decided to start with the letter. While reading the letter I heard it in the same voice from the phone “Subject 451, you received the package with the details but have yet to open it”. My breath caught in my throat, how could he know that? The letter continued, “There is a strict deadline of starting the study within 24 hours of receiving the package. Failure to do so will result in immediate termination.”. Something felt off about the last part. He didn’t say termination from the study, he just said termination. Almost like a promise. Who is this and what the hell did I get myself into. The letter stopped there, as short and concise as the phone call. As the feeling of someone watching me shrouded my entire being, I opened the package. 

As I opened the package I was underwhelmed. I know, not the reaction anyone reading so far was expecting. But that is how it felt. Anyways. The only thing the box contained was a piece of paper and one singular pill, both seated inside a black styrofoam. The pill was nothing special. It was a capsule, the kind where it has powder inside. One side was gold and the other side was black. I had never seen this exact pill, but I expected as much for a new study. What was weird is that the pill had no container, no name, no markings on it. The pill was perfectly slotted into place, just the pill and nothing else. The letter was precisely folded in its own slot. The letter revealed just as much as the phone call and previous letter. Once again my mind hears the words in that same low, gravely voice. One that would be scarred into my brain for the rest of my life. Rest of my lives anyway. The letter read “Subject 451, if you are reading this, then the package is open. Opening this package means you agree to the contract of the study. We will continue to observe you to obtain information as needed. We will not contact you again until the end of the study. Take the pill and the study will begin.”. 

As with every other part of this study, this letter left me with more questions than answers. One pill? What kind of study only has one dose of medicine? What does it mean to continue to observe me? Have they already been watching me? That would explain how they knew I hadn’t opened the package yet. Feeling seriously puzzled, I flipped the letter over looking for any more information. That is exactly what I found. This side of the letter explained the compensation. “On completion of the study you will be awarded $20,000. This will only be given to those who: 1. Survive the study, 2. Yield the desired results, 3. Ensure the confidentiality of the study throughout the duration. Thank you for your participation, subject 451.”. Regardless of how many questions I still had, there was no way I was walking away now. $20,000 would have me set for the rest of my college years if budgeted right. This was worth the risk. I had to stop thinking about all the “what ifs” and just do it. “Full send” as the kids say. I closed my eyes, took the pill, and threw it back as quickly as I could.

Part 3:

I’m not sure what I expected to happen, or why I thought it would happen instantly. I’m sure I looked like a character in a cartoon, opening my eyes one at a time after having them squeezed tightly closed. I felt…nothing. Nothing was different, there was no fuzzy or tingling feeling. I looked the same, talked the same, and had no sudden super power. I wish I still felt as disappointed as I did then. I stood in the same spot trying to feel anything from this wonder pill. I gave up after around five minutes, deciding I had gotten the placebo. That’s a lot of money for a sugar pill but I'm not complaining. The rest of my day was unremarkable. The only thing that stood out was my roommate never returned. 

From there my life did improve, but nothing extraordinary. I graduated with my degree in English literature. I met my wife at a conference for professors, and eventually got my Master’s degree. We had four beautiful children. I lived the most majestic life that I never envisioned for myself. I traveled the world with the love of my life, watched my children achieve their dreams. I lived until I was 86 years old. Content with my life and ready to reach the beyond. My family surrounded me in what we knew were my last moments. I closed my eyes and felt my last breath leave my lips. I felt my heart cease to pump. I faded into nothing. Then I was standing in a room.

I was standing in what I knew to be a dorm room from my previous room. The room that was over 65 years ago. I remembered everything. Every feeling, every drop of water on my face, each time making love to my wife. My mind reeled, standing in the same spot trying to comprehend what the hell was happening. I snapped too, realizing I was standing in someone’s room. I looked around and thankfully it seemed to be a single room. However, everything was in pastel colors. So I knew for sure this was not my old room. As I was looking around, my gaze passed a mirror. Two things were immediately wrong. I was a woman. I was African American. This was a stark contrast to who I knew myself to be, a white man. 

I tried everything. I pinched myself, I talked out loud, I recited the names of my entire family, or old family, over and over again. I paced the room until I was in a full blown panic attack. I was hyperventilating until the entire room was replaced with black as I lost consciousness. I woke up to the same pastel covered room. But something was different. I knew who I was. I knew I used to be a man with a wife, who lived a full life. At the same time I knew I was this woman. The name that was given to me was “Lily”. These two things were true at the same time. I felt a peace like this was meant to be, no more panic, just acceptance. In my now calm state, I saw the ever familiar white package. Still with no labels, stamps, or anything except for “Subject 451”. 

This package only contained a letter, no other pill. With every passing moment I felt more like Lily than I had ever felt like my old self. The one thing that was exactly the same, was I am subject 451. I opened the letter with more enthusiasm than the first. The letter was the longest I had received so far. It said “Congratulations subject 451. You have finished the first round of the study. Continue to do as you have been, there are no further instructions. We will continue to contact you at the end of each round.”. This was starting to feel more eerie. The only information I had so far was, I lived a full life and died as a white man. Then I woke up as an African American woman. Does this mean the rounds are each a life? I needed to keep going to find out for sure. 

That is exactly what I do. I continue in this life. Each minute that goes by I learn more about who I am, who Lily is. I learn all my friends, my family, my dreams and everything else that comprises Lily. And I run with it. I dropped out of school this time to pursue a career as a model. This was a dream of mine for a while. Since I was a little girl. I know that’s as weird to read, as  it is to say. Like I said though, I was now Lily. There was no distinction between the two of us. Like I was saying, I became a model. I started from stock photos, the ones in every picture frame from the store. From there, I went on to be in catalogs. Posing to sell things like clothes, tables, perfumes. Nothing big. Eventually the big times came around. I was the model for an ad shown in New York Times Square. This really launched my career. I knew fame, fortune, luxury. This continued until the model expiration date of mid 30’s. I found an amazing husband. We never had kids but focused on living life to the fullest. We visited a new country every month. We owned the most coveted items on the market. Life was great, until it wasn’t. 

We both fell into addiction. The renowned “booger sugar” got its claws in both me and my husband. Within two years, we lost everything we owned. Our cars were repossessed, our house was foreclosed. Our marriage fell apart next. I was at my lowest. This was when I turned my life around. I went into rehab, I got clean. Against all odds, I got sober. I never got back to the wealth or life I had before, and that was exactly what I wanted. I took myself shopping on my five year anniversary of sobriety in New York, the home of my success. That’s when I ran into my husband. 

He looked worse than when we separated. It was clear he hadn’t gotten clean, only went further into the darkness of addiction. When he asked me to grab a coffee, I couldn’t say no. I also couldn’t say no when he asked for a nighttime walk. No was all I could say as he pulled out a knife, wanting all my bags. I tried to reason with him, I pleaded to the love I thought he had deep in his heart for me. Even after I gave him all the bags I had, my wallet, my watch and my shoes, he was never the man I married. The last image I saw was my ex-husband covered in my own blood, a look of horror on his face as he ran away, carrying everything I gave him. My eyes, Lily’s eyes, fluttered closed for the last time. 

Part 4: 

My seemingly third life started with a choking gasp as I fought to fill my lungs with air. Tears still in my eyes with a heart full of betrayal. It was the remnants of Lily’s life. My head was filled with grief, grief for Lily, for my wife, for myself. Nothing made sense. This is the second time I’ve died! Most people get one death and that’s how it should be. I was breaking the laws of nature. My head was splitting. This was the most intense headache I’ve ever had. Knives were  stabbing into my eyes, my forehead was on fire, the rest of my head felt as though it was put in between a hydraulic press. The pain was unbearable and just as I was about to scream, the same damn voice from the phone was in my head. 

“Subject 451. We are very impressed with your progress. There is a lot of valuable information we have gathered. However, it is not enough. We require you to persist with the study. The pill has now traversed your blood system and crossed your blood brain barrier. We apologize you were not forewarned of the pain this process causes. It allows us to ensure authentic reactions. The pill crossing is why you can now hear us in your head. It also allows us to obtain both passive and active information. And if you decide you no longer want to participate in this study, it will be how we terminate you. Continue with the thought of the compensation if needed for motivation. You have proven to be valuable subject 451 but know this does not mean you are irreplaceable. Thank you for your continued participation.”.

I sat for what must have been hours. Completely devoid of any emotion or feeling, well all but one. I felt regret. No amount of money was worth this. I begged, cried, prayed to anything and anyone to take me back. At one point I begged for the termination the voice taunted me with. It never came. I did the only thing I could do. I continued living this third life. I soon learned the life I was living could not be ended by me. It was always someone else, the elements, an accident, anything out of my control. And the system knew the difference. I thought this study would try my body but this. This is a torment of my very soul.  This is where the rest of them bleed together. Third, fourth, fifth and so on. 

I lived every life imaginable. I was rich beyond measure, a royal family member, part of a remote village that current society didn’t even know existed. I practiced every religion, had jobs across the board. I was a father, a mother, son, brother, daughter, sister and every other part of the family tree.  In theory this would be an amazing experience. But after fifty years of accomplishing goals, finding love, experiencing heartbreak, and all the aspects of human life, it drains you. I have seen more people I love die, than have come into my life. It’s knowing once they’re gone they stay gone, but I will always return. Living a life where they no longer exist. 

The worst part of this entire thing has been forgetting. I forget more and more of each life as I get a new one. I don’t remember my original name. I have no memory of where I went to school, why I went. I do remember my wife, my first wife. She was the love of all my lives. Every new life I write as much as I can about her so she doesn’t fade away with all the others. Her face is blurry in my mind but I know she was beautiful. She is the one reason I would do all of this again. The only thing that remained of me was subject 451. 

The voice never spoke to me again. I yelled as loud as I could. I practiced meditation. I thought over and over how I was done. I reached out as much as I could. I exhausted every resource I had. I even got medical tests and scans. They came back normal. Nothing got their attention. It was always radio silence. I was abandoned, left in this limbo of existence. From the best I can remember I have lived 450 lives. I don’t know if this will be my last. I am subject 451 after all.",3,1758928268.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I’m 28M, she’s 22F (4th year nursing student). We met on a dating app back in July, talked for like two days, then moved to WhatsApp, then Messenger. The app was kind of anonymous, so that’s where we exchanged real names.

On the 5th day, I decided to take an 8-hour bus ride from Rizal to see her. I brought flowers, we went for coffee and dinner — it honestly felt like a proper date. After that, we went to my Airbnb and yeah… things happened on the first meet.

For context: she came out of a 3-year relationship about 3–4 months before we met. Her ex cheated on her, and she told me several times she wasn’t ready for a relationship yet. I told her I was willing to take the risk because I’d already fallen for her.

When I went back home, we kept talking every day and night. Two weeks later, I traveled back to see her again (another 8-hour ride). This time it was a surprise — she didn’t know I was coming. She was super happy and even admitted she thought I wasn’t serious about her (probably because we slept together the first time). We spent the night together again, went out, had coffee, dinner, the usual couple stuff. Leaving her again made her sad.

Fast forward a week later, I went back for the 3rd time. She caught me on Messenger with my backpack, so my “surprise” was ruined. 😂 This time I stayed for 3 days and we spent a lot of time together. Everything felt right, we were happy.

Eventually, I decided to just move to her city (yep, another 8 hours from my hometown). I rented a place, found a job as a BPO manager with decent pay, and we basically see each other every day now. We eat together, sleep together, she introduced me to her family as a “friend” (still courting stage), and I’ve even stayed in her room multiple times.

Here’s the thing — she’s tried to break things off a couple of times, but I begged her to stay. Until now, we still don’t have a label.

I really love her, but I also want to protect my mental health. I know pain is part of love, but I don’t want to lose myself in the process.

Let's make something we can both be proud of. I am looking for someone who wants to build a real, long-term relationship. We can start online and see where it goes.

Pics of me: [https://imgur.com/gallery/pics-of-me-ido4Zc2](https://imgur.com/gallery/pics-of-me-ido4Zc2)

**About Me:** I laugh easy and care deeply. A bit of a hopeless romantic. I value patience, loyalty, and honesty. Writing is my passion, and I'm an honors student going for my Master's in English: Creative Writing. I'm also pretty athletic myself, and I'm a big mental and physical health advocate.

**Hobbies/Interests:** I am big on exercise and nature! I love long walks, weightlifting, and breathing fresh air instead of being cramped up inside. I have a huge wall of books and manga (included at the end, in case interested)! I'm a big gamer, with some of my favorites being Final Fantasy, Baldur's Gate, NieR:Automata, Pokémon, and more. I play PC and Switch. I'd love to cosplay with someone one day with my partner. I can also cook a number of foods, so big plus there if you like pastas and meats!

**What I bring to a relationship:** I like to make sure my partner feels heard and can smile each day. We would have bookstore, coffee shop, or park dates in person. Online we could have calls watching anime, talking, gaming, reading, or anything else interesting! My long-term goal is that I'm considering teaching English in Japan one day.

**What sort of person I'm looking for?:** A kind woman who is good natured and gives her all to the people she cares for. Someone polite, maybe a little reserved. Someone who shares my values in loyalty, purity, honesty, and patience. I would want someone who believes in the sacredness of saving herself. You would like nerdy things like me, gaming, anime, etc. Appearance wise, health is important to me, so slim to athletic. A cute face and eyes I can fall for. I date to marry, so I would want someone who is doing the same.

**Age range:** 18+, though for maturity 21-27 may work best.

**Would you be willing to do long distance/relocate?:** I would want to do Long Distance, yes. I am located in Indiana (EST), but I am willing to date anyone here in America or in Japan only with a long-term goal made.

1nrforq,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1nrforq/anyone_else_experience_anxietypanic_after/,Anyone else experience anxiety/panic after quitting nicotine?,"I’ve been vaping since high school, though I managed to quit for a year without much trouble. During that time, I drank a lot of coffee but never dealt with anxiety. Eventually, I picked the habit back up, and more recently I tried switching to Zyns since I thought they’d be easier on my lungs.

One night while I was working in my room, out of nowhere I got this overwhelming feeling and had what turned out to be a panic attack. After that, I quit Zyns completely and stayed off both vaping and Zyns for about a week. But during those days, I was waking up with sweaty palms, feeling anxious all day, and I couldn’t focus on anything I was having negative intrusive thoughts and was scared to even be home alone which is so weird also found it difficult to even walk to get a drink from the convenience as I had a panic attack in the line. My mind kept going back to that panic attack. I was crying like everyday. 

I went to the doctor and she prescribed my SSRI she’s given me them before since I told her I had anxiety but it was regular anxiety like test anxiety etc not walking to the store or going places myself type of thing. 

6 months before this I did quit my part time job to focus on school and spent a lot of time isolated in my room I wasn’t socializing with anyone I’m 21 and in a weird spot my job was my only “social outlet”. anyways during this time I was basically nocturnal and eating like shit and a ton of coffee and energy drinks so I think that heavily contributed. 


It’s been a little over two months since then. I started vaping again because when I took that break, the anxiety didn’t fully go away, so I thought maybe nicotine wasn’t the cause. But now I’m starting to wonder if it actually is. 

I still haven’t really left the house by myself like I use to, to study or anything only just to go to class or labs then straight home. I have no motivation and I keep going on Reddit to search shit up like this is my only focus now it’s terrible. 

I’ve been taking like .5 of Ativan daily for the last 2 weeks and it helped with the physical symptoms and the thoughts but I’ve been waking up after 4-5 hours of sleep recently and that’s making things worse. 

I did throw out my vape for a day and I still woke up but slept better once I went back to sleep. 

Has anyone else gone through something similar like panic attacks or days of feeling hyper vigilant and unable to focus after quitting nicotine? I still feel “off,” like I can’t do things the way I used to, and I don’t really know how to explain it. Also I’m vaping way more now which is bad.  I haven’t had a panic attack though but I feel different like off balance and depersonalization especially recently I think due to the sleeplessness. Maybe my nervous system just collapsed due to the school stress and nicotine caffiene I put it through and now I’m stuck until I take the meds which I don’t want to since they take a while to work and may not even work and at the same time I gotta do school work which is hard to do anyways right now and im imagining doing it while this pill is altering my brain. I also searched too many stories of the side effects of them. I’m just looking for an answer man I want to quit but idk if it’s a deeper problem idk if I need the meds. I don’t want to drop out or fail. ",3,1758927815.0,QuittingZyn,5,1.0,False

I recently finished ""Regretting You"" by Colleen Hoover, and I wanted to share my thoughts with you all, especially if you're looking for a heartfelt read or perhaps just starting your reading adventure. If you're interested in diving into a story about family, love, and the tough choices that shape us, you can explore more about [Regretting You – Colleen Hoover](https://pdfhive.com/regretting-you-colleen-hoover/) here.

### My Honest Thoughts on Colleen Hoover's 'Regretting You'

**A Glimpse into the Story (No Spoilers, I promise!)**

""Regretting You"" centers around a mother and daughter, Morgan and Clara. Morgan made certain choices early in life, choosing marriage and motherhood over a career, while her vibrant teenage daughter, Clara, is just beginning to navigate her first serious relationship. Their lives, though seemingly stable, are about to be shattered by a devastating accident. This tragedy forces them to confront deep-seated secrets, unexpected betrayals, and the very definition of love and loyalty. It's a powerful narrative about how grief can transform relationships and how forgiveness, both of others and oneself, is a complicated, messy journey.

**What Really Stood Out to Me**

*   **The Characters and Their Depth:** Colleen Hoover has a knack for creating characters that feel incredibly real, and ""Regretting You"" is no exception. Morgan's struggle to cope with loss, protect her daughter, and redefine her identity resonated deeply. Clara's raw teenage emotions, her anger, and her desperate need for truth felt authentic. Watching their mother-daughter dynamic evolve under such intense pressure was compelling. You genuinely root for them, even when they make mistakes.

*   **Emotional Rollercoaster:** If you're looking for a book that will make you *feel*, this is it. It delves into grief, betrayal, first love, and the enduring power of family. There were moments that brought tears to my eyes, and others that made my heart ache. It's a testament to the author's writing that she can evoke such strong emotions without ever feeling manipulative.

*   **Pacing and Storytelling:** The story unfolds beautifully, alternating between Morgan's and Clara's perspectives. This dual viewpoint offers a rich, balanced understanding of their individual struggles and shared pain. The pacing kept me absolutely hooked – I found myself constantly needing to know what would happen next, how they would navigate the next revelation or challenge.

**A Couple of Honest Nuances**

While I truly enjoyed this book, there were a couple of minor points worth mentioning. At times, some of the emotional conflicts felt a little bit drawn out, though this is often characteristic of intense character-driven dramas. Also, without giving anything away, some plot developments might feel a touch convenient for certain situations. However, these are minor observations that didn't detract significantly from my overall enjoyment of the story.

**Would I Recommend It? And For Whom?**

Absolutely, yes! I would wholeheartedly recommend ""Regretting You"" by Colleen Hoover.

It's an excellent choice for:

*   **Fans of emotional, character-driven contemporary fiction.**
*   **Readers who enjoy exploring complex family dynamics, particularly mother-daughter relationships.**
*   **Anyone looking for a story about healing, resilience, and second chances.**

Even if you typically lean towards thrillers or fantasy, this book offers a gripping emotional journey that might surprise you. It's a wonderful opportunity to dip your toes into a different genre and experience the depth of human connection.

### A Little Guide for New Readers

For those of you who might be new to reading or looking to get back into it, here are a few simple tips to make your journey enjoyable:

1.  **Pick What Calls To You:** Don't feel pressured to read what everyone else is reading. Whether it's a romance, a mystery, a fantasy epic, or a historical drama, choose a book that genuinely sparks your curiosity. If ""Regretting You"" sounds interesting, great! If not, keep exploring!
2.  **Start Small:** You don't need to read for hours every day. Even 15-20 minutes can make a difference. Read during your commute, before bed, or with your morning coffee. Consistency is more important than duration.
3.  **It's Okay to Take Breaks:** If a book isn't grabbing you immediately, give it a chapter or two. If it's still not working, it's perfectly fine to set it aside. There are too many amazing books in the world to force yourself through one you're not enjoying.
4.  **Don't Be Afraid to Highlight or Take Notes:** If a passage moves you or a quote resonates, feel free to mark it. It makes the experience more personal and helps you remember what you loved.

Remember, reading is a personal adventure. It's about discovering new worlds, understanding different perspectives, and finding joy in the quiet moments between the pages. So, take a chance, open a book, and let the story carry you away.

even going out to eat at a resto, you'd be lucky to find a place that has decent tea. it's always some bagged stuff. i mean bagged stuff is fine if you're really forced to drink it or that's all you know.

even going out to eat a chinese place, you'd be lucky to get loose leaf.

i can't.

unless you specifically look out for a place that actually bothers to do it correctly, which is basically almost nowhere.

most places already use the cheapest possible crap or some weird fru fru hipster stuff you can't drink like tazo. then they don't bother to study what temp is right and for how long.

and the only ""tea"" places you can find would be like bubble tea. and that's not really tea if you like it to be just water and tea. sure maybe if you want something sweet and maybe can handle milk (i'm lactorse intolerant). sure maybe some chai with milk or some milk tea is fine sometimes if you want something sweet.

this is why you would find posts even in this subreddit looking for places you can do tea tastings or proper tea shops.

it's like, where can you find a proper tea shop aside from china town? or a place where you can have tea tastings?

i mean it's kinda weird if you'd go to a place and ask, can i bring my own tea there? can i bring my own tea set and my own water heater and my own water? lol.

  
now onto my hate for tazo brand, their green tea is weird! don't call it green tea if it's not actually tea!

it's a tisane! panget ng lasa e. the most i would drink if i want something flowery would be jasmine tea. or unless i actually ordered a flowery tisane na sinadya. i mean wtf. it's some weird hispter crap I CANNOT DRINK. i refuse to drink that stuff. even if you put sugar in it it still tastes like shit.",1,1758927536.0,tsaaph,0,1.0,False
