1i97ajn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1i97ajn/help_with_panel_location_treat_utility_space_as/,"Help with panel location. Treat utility space as damp, or is dry reasonable?","I'm a DIYer helping my son with electrical on a coffee shop in a horse trailer (photos below). Nearly all of the outlets will be in the utility space up front, with a 50A inlet there as well. There are 3 logical spots for the panel:

1. In the main space, in the wall under the serving window:

   * easy access but potential spills from the serving shelf

1. In the main space, under the front counter, with the back of the panel in the utility space

   * easy access, but potential spills from coffee making on counter

1. In the utility space, mounted high on the plywood:

   * safe from spills, but limited access and nearby water tank & heater (rough positions in photo)

Seems to me that spills are a nearly guaranteed risk for 1 & 2, while the water tank & heater in 3 is far less of a risk unless some catastrophic failure occurs.

So... any advice on panel location?

And... should the utility space be treated as a damp location or is dry reasonable? The door will be closed 99% of the time, and it has a good seal. I'd sure like to use FMC rather than EMT conduit here.

Thanks in advance!

I would jot down my thoughts on Google Keep. The weekend I thought she'd cancel, mentioned in the letter, I went to her place and watched our football team lose. I got the hint for sure when she asked my if I wanted coffee to go, when the game was over. I declined. 

I'd usually stay overnight. I asked before I left if it was the end of another chapter. She said yes. I took my belongings, said ""thanks for everything"", and left. 

Coach Ryan mentions in his content the discard and the slow fade. The other breakups were discards. This was the slow fade.

Well, this is happening again. You won't even reach out and I don't know why. At least you respond to my texts. I'm expecting you will cancel plans for me to come over this coming weekend.

Hello, I am in a situation right now along with 40 other employees. We work for a coffee chain that is a part of a big nonprofit retail store, and we all just got laid off today because the company is shutting down due to financial issues, as they told us. After the zoom call where they laid us off all employees created a separate group chat to discuss what happened. 

Upon joining the group chat, there was a barrage of messages talking about fraudulent behavior committed by the company. A manager for one of the locations claimed that no money was being donated when it was supposed to be, and that the higher-ups were paying themselves upwards of $350,000 a year. Allegedly, a different manager tried to bring up this issue to the higher-ups and proceeded to get fired, before this situation went down today.

There were some things that I was concerned about financially regarding this company. They continued to open stores when other stores were not performing. They had goals to change all of our coffee syrups to a much more expensive brand, they didn’t pay the pastry distributors for the past three months, and they were trying to cut hours at the locations all while continually expanding. We all suspect that this was a money laundering scheme.

As of right now, we don’t have any solid evidence since it’s so fresh except for a video of the zoom call where they laid us off and explained the severance package. As a part of the severance package, there is a confidentiality agreement where we are not allowed to discuss or take action against them.

I am wondering if anyone has any advice on what we could try and do to trigger an investigation into the company, I doubt we have enough evidence on our own to try and sue. Here are some questions:

- Is there a way to trigger an investigation like contacting the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network?
- If enough of us bring attention to this issue, about 40 of us, could that be enough to trigger an investigation?
- As for the severance agreement, do you recommend we wait to sign it until we get more information?
- Any advice for this would be much appreciated, I don’t even know where to start with this kind of thing.

Thank you all.

Do I tell him?,"Hello! I recently moved to a new apartment about two months ago and have three roommates (two girls and one guy). Let’s call the guy Avery. Avery is a single man who is very handsome, charismatic, hardworking, and funny. He and I are like the same person, just different fonts. I’ve never met someone who connects with me so well. I’ve only been living with him for such a short time, but we’ve told each other all about each other’s lives and trauma and stuff. We’ve been hanging out alone more recently and stay up late often to talk to one another. We’ve been going to coffee shops, working out at the gym, and have gone dancing and such. I feel like he consistently flirts with me. He calls me funny all the time, walks with me in the cold when he doesn’t have to, opens car doors for me, compliments me a lot (called me pretty and says he likes my outfits), boops my head, always the first to offer me help, and other things of that nature. Last night we went out to a dance bar and once we were home we watched YouTube, cuddled on the couch, and stayed up till 7 am laughing and talking. I feel like these are very obvious signs he likes me, but I am getting some mixed signals.

He talks about how he wants to date people, tells me about his exes or who he is talking to romantically, calls me “buddy” (he calls a lot of people that), and some things like that. I feel like I’ve been similarly talking to him, so I can hide my feelings to not make things weird. I am so confused because he seems very much into me. I am an outgoing, conventionally attractive woman who often gets attention. I know I have a chance with him and I know he finds me attractive. I’m so confused. Maybe he’s doing the same thing as me and wants to hide how he feels too and not make it weird.

I don’t know what to do. I want to tell him how I feel. Especially since he gets flirted with by a lot of women and someone will probably snatch him up soon. I’m so nervous. I don’t want to make things weird between us or make my other roommates possibly uncomfortable if he and I started dating. I know people say “don’t shit where you eat”, and I should probably listen to that. But I’ve never met a man like him before and want to pursue this. I have a hard time liking people and am very picky. This is rare for me to feel this way. I guess the good news is that our lease ends in 5 months. Maybe I can wait till then to tell him, but still, it’s so uncertain.

Should I go tell him how I feel or wait? Do you think he likes me? I am so confused and don’t want to make a mistake. Any advice on this would be very helpful. Thank you so much! 

TL;DR : My new roommate is perfect for me romantically and flirts with me often. He and I hang out alone a lot and stay up late talking and he cuddled me. I’m getting some mixed signals from him, but I have a feeling he’s hiding his feelings so we don’t make our living situation weird. I want to tell him how I feel but I am scared to make things awkward or make it weird for my roommates. ",0,1737755458.0,relationships,2,0.5,False

Since I was a kid I never really ate sugar because my mom was the Mexican version of a healthy almond mom and she would focus on clean eating. The signs were always there but due to my mom being really good with routines and healthy foods I was able to have a normal life even though things would some times take me 3x the effort not knowing why. 

I have now been taking medication for a year and I had to lower my caffeine intake and be very careful with sugar intake. My issue is that during the pandemic I started eating sugars and from hating chocolate I now kind of like it because it helps me help better during my periods or to stay awake when I'm falling asleep at work and can't drink coffee (stomach issues and shakiness after taking my Vyvanse). I'm only on 30mg but every time I take it I get shaky even without drinking coffee and I started noticing that when I eat chocolate (as little as a square) I start feeling tachycardia and my hands shake so much. 

I guess I'd like to know if this is normal or if anyone goes through something similar. I noticed that even when I don't take the medication some times my hands shake a little bit but this is something that NEVER happened before Vyvanse. I used to do lots of dioramas and work with my hands, painting and cutting lots of details and I would joke my pulse was like a surgeon.

I then followed a strict healthy diet and drank only coffee and water and consumed beetroot powder and labs September 24th were ast 16 alt 28 bilirubin 0.9 not sure on unconjugated bilirubin.  But I saw a liver specialist October 1st who said nothing was wrong since my enzymes and bilirubin returned to normal and he did a finroscan which cap 128 and kpa 3.4 . Still having symptoms of liver issues I saw another liver specialist at that same clinic this past Monday, she did a fibroscan cap 217 kpa 4.4 and a hepatic function panel and alt 28 ast 30 and bilirubin 1.6 and unconjugated bilirubin 0.5.

1i96rqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/RadicalChristianity/comments/1i96rqq/i_asked_chat_gpt_to_write_me_a_biblically/,I asked chat Gpt to write me a biblically accurate story of Jesus and Adonai walking through modern America. At the end I also asked it to add an abortion clinic and protesters.This is what it wrote:,"**Title: ""A Walk Through the Modern World""**

The air buzzed with the hum of city life as the Lord, Adonai, and His Son, Jesus, walked silently among the people of a modern American city. The streets were filled with the noise of traffic, the rush of pedestrians, and the glow of countless advertisements. It was an unfamiliar world, yet one where the hearts of men were still the same. They had come to see how the modern Christians lived, and how they had understood the ancient words of truth.

Jesus stopped at a busy street corner and observed a large church building. The sign out front advertised a ""prosperity gospel"" service, promising wealth and success to all who attended. People in suits and dresses were entering, smiles on their faces, as if expecting something grand. 

**""Father,""** Jesus began, His voice soft yet firm, **""is this what they think I came for? To give them wealth and fame?""**

Adonai, towering beside His Son, surveyed the scene with a deep sadness in His eyes. **""No, My Son. Their hearts have been swayed by the ways of this world. They seek earthly treasures, not understanding that true riches are found in heaven.""**

They moved closer, their steps unseen by the crowds around them. Inside the church, a pastor stood on the stage, delivering an impassioned sermon, promising that faith would bring material blessings. The congregation nodded along, a chorus of agreement filling the air.

Jesus’ brow furrowed. **""This is not the message I gave them. I came to seek and save the lost, not to make them wealthy. I spoke of taking up crosses, of self-sacrifice, of loving the poor and the needy. Why have they strayed so far from the truth?""**

Adonai’s voice was deep, a mix of grief and compassion. **""The world has shaped them. They have forgotten that My kingdom is not of this world. They have built kingdoms of their own, and in doing so, they have built walls between themselves and Me. But I will not leave them, My Son. I will call them back.""**

They moved on, unnoticed, through the streets, and came upon another scene: a group of Christians gathered outside a coffee shop, arguing over the latest political controversy. Their voices were raised in anger, divided by opinions, some speaking of love and others speaking of judgment.

**""Father, look at them,""** Jesus said, His heart breaking. **""They fight and bicker, even though I taught them to love one another, to be peacemakers.""**

Adonai’s voice came, quiet but powerful. **""It is the human heart, My Son. They hold grudges, they are swayed by fear and pride. They think they are standing for truth, but they forget that love is the greatest commandment. They have become so focused on what divides them that they fail to see what unites them — My love for them all.""**

Jesus turned to face the group, His eyes filled with compassion and sorrow. **""Will they ever see it, Father? Will they ever understand that the love I gave is the love they must give in return?""**

Adonai, with a tender smile, placed a hand on His Son’s shoulder. **""They will, My Son. Some will see, some will hear. And they will turn, and they will remember. But it is up to them to choose. I gave them free will, and with it, the power to choose love over hate, unity over division.""**

They continued their journey, watching silently as the world went on around them, each soul going about their day, unaware of the presence of their Creator. But their eyes were never far from those who believed in them.

After a while, they came upon a more disturbing scene: protesters stood outside an abortion clinic, shouting angrily at those entering. They held signs with harsh words, condemning those they deemed guilty. The protesters’ faces were filled with fury, their voices loud with accusations, while the women who entered the clinic walked past with their heads down.

Jesus stopped, His expression full of sorrow. **""Father, why do they stand here, shouting in My name? Do they not understand that I did not come to condemn, but to save?""**

Adonai’s voice was heavy with grief. **""They have forgotten My heart, My Son. They see the world through the lens of judgment, not compassion. They think they are standing for righteousness, but they are standing on the wrong side. My heart breaks for the hurting, for the broken, for those who feel they have no choice. I have never called My people to stand in condemnation, but to reach out in love and understanding.""**

Jesus sighed deeply, looking at the women who passed by, their eyes filled with fear, sorrow, and pain. **""And what of them, Father? What do we say to those who feel they are abandoned, those who are caught in their own despair?""**

Adonai responded with tenderness. **""Tell them that I am here. Tell them that they are not forgotten. My love covers all things, and there is no sin too great, no decision too final, that My grace cannot reach. I did not come to cast stones, but to offer healing to the brokenhearted.""**

Jesus turned to the protesters, their anger so clear in their eyes. **""Do they not see, Father? Do they not see that My love is for all people, regardless of their choices? I came to set the captives free, not to bind them in chains of guilt.""**

Adonai’s voice was soft but firm. **""I call you to mercy, not sacrifice. You have the law, but you have forgotten love. You have sought righteousness, but you have neglected justice. My people must learn to love as I have loved them — unconditionally, without pride, without condemnation.""**

Jesus nodded, His heart heavy but resolute. **""And I will keep calling them, Father. I will keep showing them the way of grace.""**

Together, they stood there, watching as the world carried on around them — a world full of pain, division, and confusion. But in the midst of it all, the love of the Father and the Son still reached out, still beckoned, still waited for all to return.

As they turned to leave, Jesus spoke one final time. **""Father, how long will it be before they truly return to You?""**

Adonai, with a voice full of patience and eternal love, replied, **""I have been patient with them for many generations. I will wait, My Son. I will always be here, calling them back, waiting for the moment when they choose to listen to My voice.""**

Jesus nodded, understanding His Father’s heart. **""And I will be with them always, even to the end of the age.""**

With that, they vanished into the crowds, unseen, but present, as they always had been — a quiet witness, offering love, hope, and redemption to a world that had forgotten the depth of their message.",0,1737754771.0,RadicalChristianity,1,0.18,False

I'll write my biggest deal breaker first so you don't have to keep reading if you're not interested.

Having lots of relationship history with intimacy. Personally I don't have ANY intimacy experience on purpose and I don't want someone with LOTS of experience/relationship history. Also if you broke up recently that's also a big no for me. No one is an aid band duh.

I'm 6.1 - 185cm muscular build, (not too shredded) wide shoulders, white skin, black hair, eyes and beard ( I don't like having a long beard so I keep it short or shave ) . You can see me from the link below.

I'm from Turkey and my ethnicity is Caucasian.

My personality type is INFP-A , I don't believe horoscopes or to any religion.

I'm a Concept/2D Artist. I draw character designs, potraits, any stuff I like.

I'm loyal, empathetic, protective, dependable and love to share every thought I have with my partner and also expect the same thing.

I love melancholy in general, I have couple of sad song playlists on Spotify.

My main hobbies are drawing, powerlifting and gaming. I also do some other stuff like playing electric guitar sometimes but who cares.

I like getting and giving attention in equal terms.

I'm also an open book, I don't hide anything.

Also, I do care about physical attraction, I'm adding my photos first so you don't have to send a message if you don't find me attractive enough. In the end everyone has a different taste.

Every paycheck was gone before I even saw it, my credit card debt was a disaster, and any time I’d make a tiny bit of progress, life would throw some new shit at me car repairs, medical bills, you name it. It felt like no matter what I did, I was stuck in this endless cycle of “just surviving.” But now, I’m finally seeing some light. I’m not there yet, but I’m closer to financial freedom than I ever thought I’d be.

What changed? Honestly, it wasn’t some magical solution, and it definitely wasn’t just cutting out coffee or living like a hermit. I started getting serious about figuring out what financial freedom even *meant* to me. Was it quitting my job? Having enough savings to not freak out every time an emergency happened? Turns out, I didn’t want to be rich I just wanted to feel safe. Once I got clear on that, I stopped wasting time on the stuff that didn’t matter. I started focusing on the big picture, like saving, investing, and finding ways to make my money actually work for me instead of stressing over every little dollar.

One thing that really helped me shift my perspective is this book I’ve been reading, *Work Optional: Retire Early the Non-Penny-Pinching Way* by Tanja Hester. It’s not some preachy “stop buying lattes” bullshit. It’s about figuring out how to align your money with your values so you can build a life you actually love. I’m still reading it, i found it here""[Top 5 Books to Inspire Your Early Retirement Journey](https://grow-my-moneyy.blogspot.com/2025/01/top-5-books-to-inspire-your-early.html)"" (or you can do your own research), but it’s already helped me see that financial freedom doesn’t have to mean giving up everything fun or living on rice and beans for the next decade.

I know we’ve all been through it. Feeling stuck, like no matter how hard you try, the system’s just out to screw you over. But I promise, even small changes can add up over time. If you’re grinding your way toward financial freedom too, I feel you.

I have a total of 17 1/2  teeth left, 10 of which are on the bottom. My teeth are brittle, and stained due to years of smoking (haven't done so in years) and my true love of coffee. I've had tetracycline staining all my life, so I've never had white teeth. 

I told my dentist I wanted full uppers and lowers. He advised against the lowers because of bone loss issues (I'm 57, and he wants me to wait as long as possible), also because my lower front teeth are all strong have never had cavities, and because I have spent a lot in the past year or two on crowns and lower partials. 

My concerns are: my teeth are so yellow and I'm not getting yellow dentures. My lower teeth show when I talk. He said we can bleach them several times until they pretty much match. My lower partial is very visibly metallic and uncomfortable. He will work to adjust the lower to feel comfortable. The metal is what it is. 

He also recommends against an immediate set, and says a standard set will be fine to go in after 4-8 weeks, the longer the better. I'm okay with wearing a mask in public for that time. 

So ultimately the lower thing is my decision, but I'm leaning towards his advice. He has been my dentist for years, and he does good work, so I trust him. What do you guys think?

I alternate between constipation and softer (not quite diarrhea) stools. When I’m constipated it sucks but I can fonction properly, the problem comes with the softer stools. Sometimes (it’s random it seems but only when I have softer stools) when I have to go to the bathroom I get these terrible stomachs pain, but I’m talking about TERRIBLE! I get chills, I’m sweating and I start shaking, I almost passed out multiple times. Then when the bowel movement stops the extreme pain stops as well, it leaves me with an slight stomach ache but nothing terrible. 

I tought I had gotten better because last year I would have those attacks once or twice a month and for the last 5 months it stopped. When I had those attacks frequently, I stopped eating and I lost a considerable amount of weight, I was afraid of being alone because I didn’t want to have to deal with those attacks by myself. I was constantly scared of the pain and couldn’t do much. it seemed to have stopped for a few months but now it’s back and I’m afraid. 

The pain is terrible, it’s the worst thing I’ve ever felt and the anxiety is related to the pain which sucks because I can’t do anything about it. 

I can’t really work because I always end up having to spend so much time in the bathroom. IBS isn’t considered as something that’s “bad” for most people it’s a mild inconvenience but for me, it’s ruining my life.

I was hired on to grow their website, curate and build all email marketing, manage all website maintenance, implemented and grow SEO and curate all blog content. 

The website had nearly zero direct sales when I began the position and I was their only more ""corporate"" hire outside of the barista teams at their two shops. 

About a month in, I was emailed consistently that they were bleeding money due to my salary being too high ($85,000) and that if sales didn't get to $10,000 per month direct to the website that I would likely be let go. 

Fast forward to sixty days and I was given an offer letter for $50k or else I could move forward on the job hunt. They told me my work was great but that they simply cannot afford me. 

Fast forward a year, my job responsibilities have never changed, they've actually increased. I'm sending 4-5 email campaigns per week and the website has grown increasingly yet there has been zero talk on my salary increasing at all.

Evelyn's quarters within the Den were a little different than a lot of the other girls. Where most of the rooms had a small space to warm up food or prepare beverages like tea and coffee, Evie had wanted a full kitchen, turning her chambers into a more apartment-like set up. Did she need one? Absolutely not, but it gave her the freedom to cook small meals on her own, either just for herself, or for an intimate night in with Jerry. In the future, family meals with Freyja and Sif, Jerry's daughters by his sweet and foxy Evie, would also be on her mind, something Jerry was looking forward to almost as much as the woman herself. 

Special time with his girls always struck Jerry as a good idea, especially as the family started to settle into a more normal period from this initial burst of rapid growth. 

Not that floating around in the black could ever truly be 'normal' per se, but for family cycles he'd heard from more than a few sources that a family the Bridger's size having this many infants at once was a pretty shocking thing for many aliens. If they'd had a hundred women to the marriage then sure around a hundred babies, counting expecting mothers and children yet to be hatched, especially with egg layers like Apuk the clan wasn't that strange, but with not even thirty? 

Jerry smirks into his tea cup, stifling a chuckle. 

There was no sneaking anything past Evelyn's sensitive ears however.

""What was that, darling?"" 

Says she, not even turning away from the meal she was preparing, something she said was a childhood favorite of hers. 

""Oh. I just had a funny random thought that's all. Nothing important.""

Evelyn looks over her shoulder, grinning playfully at her husband.

""Well? Go on! Spill it already.""

""Oh no, I can't trouble tonight's cook with my random inane thoughts.""

""My dear husband, I happen to adore your random inane thoughts, and always enjoy it when you share them with me. So come on. Out with it.""

""Oh I was just thinking about something that was discussed in the lounge the other day about how rapidly we've expanded our family in terms of children. That the number of children we have is absolutely wild for how 'few' wives I have.""

Jerry snickers into his beard for a moment. That twenty two spouses was considered a very small family for a man to have in the wider galaxy was something that never ceased to amuse him. Perhaps the novelty of the idea would wear off in a few decades or so, when he'd lived this lifestyle as long as he'd lived on Earth. 

""Mhmm. Yes, I remember the conversation vaguely. So what came to your mind on the subject?""

""Well Evie my dear, I think it's quite lucky that if we're going to have children like a hundred girl marriage, that each of you is worth a hundred other women in your own right. So by that standard I'm perhaps one of the most married men in the galaxy, and we have very few children."" 

Evelyn swats Jerry with her tail as she passes by, retrieving a salad from the fridge. 

""Oh you wicked man. Shameless flattery will get you nowhere you know that right? We're wise to your little ways.""

""Heh. Then you should know I only speak the truth about my girls. I married some very exceptional women and for this I am eternally blessed.""

""Hmmph."" 

Evelyn snorts at Jerry theatrically, then breaks out in giggles before getting a bit more somber as she puts the finishing touches on dinner.

""I certainly don't feel exceptional right now. This course that's supposed to prepare me to stand to as the executive officer for the Crimson Tear vice Sharon is brutal. I'm not an officer Jerry! Not a real one. I'm a trumped up enlisted sailor with delusions of grandeur."" 

Jerry rolls his eyes slightly, ensuring he's out of view of Evelyn. She needed support not sarcasm at the moment, but he'd been hearing this self doubt routine for a while now.

""Darling, I'm not sure why you reduce yourself like that, but if it helps, allow me to remind you that when you married me, you were a middle manager at a large corporate firm. You performed exceptionally and were being groomed for leadership there. Since rejoining the military you have performed exceptionally and have been not just being groomed for leadership, but leading in point of fact, mentoring numerous junior officers, including other division leaders with less experience than you. Save taking Al Gray away from his engines, I don't have any other rated line naval officers of appropriate seniority with as broad a background and good contact with the rest of the crew as you do. Even then, Sharon and I considered everyone fairly, including a few candidates from Centris. You were the best woman for the job. End of story."" 

Evelyn's ears wiggle a bit as she turns some food over with what amounted to cooking chopsticks, even if the Volpiri word for the kitchen tool was nearly unpronounceable for Jerry. 

""...Yeah. You. You're right. Sorry I'm being a bit insane about this but every now and then I'm just... confused.""

""How do you think I feel? I'm a grunt, a special forces grunt, but a grunt all the same. You at least served on warships as a young woman. I've spent my whole career prior to leaving Cruel Space breaking things and killing people with the poor bloody infantry and then fate ordained I should become a naval officer, and now I find myself commanding a small fleet as the admiral in command. Senior officer present. The old man. The boss. The first and last line for responsibility and the ultimate authority and guardian over thousands of lives.""

""...Hmmm. Good point, though you were a bit more than just a trigger puller. You had an extensive education.""

""A master's degree in international relations does little to prepare you for interstellar diplomacy or commanding a battle group. I didn't even have a chance to attend the Naval War College as a junior field grade officer before I got tapped for the Dauntless, promoted a grade and thrown into some of the wildest training I've ever participated in. Made all the more fun by basically having to make up the course as we went along so we could start training the rest of the crew.""

""You did later get an equivalent course from the Undaunted didn't you?""

""Sort of. Three months is a pretty abbreviated course. Everything else has been on the job training and occasionally getting a chance to pick Admiral Cistern's brain on something.""

""Well you've done a stellar job of faking it till you've made it. Hence those shiny silver stars.""

Jerry gives Evelyn a pointed look as she brings the mysterious pot of something to the table.

""Alright. Alright. I guess I've done a good job too."" The alien beauty relents, seating herself along with the salad.

""Good, so long as we're clear. Onto more pressing matters. What is this Evie?""

Evelyn whips the lid off the pot with a dramatic flourish worthy of Vegas, revealing a very intriguing looking dish. It was familiar in a way. A nearly clear broth, with some vegetables and meat, paired with noodles that resembled glass noodles to Jerry's eye. It was a cousin to... pho maybe?

""Well this looks and smells great, Evie!""

""I'm glad you think so, valsin is the slang name for it on my home planet, but there's about a billion and one names for noodles in broth on numerous planets. This one uses a Volpiri meat animal that's somewhat beef like in taste but more like rabbit in texture... and size. Which is why they haven't really gotten popular off of the Volpiri core worlds. Kinda hard to farm, not in demand enough to clone. Thankfully, my little sister happens to run a massive cloning farm and was able to prepare a decent sized order of it for me. The rest of the family will be trying it tonight too.""

""Any particular way to eat it?""

""Not really. Served like this, it's a shared meal. So you and I eat from the same dish.""

Evelyn's ears flutter a bit, the lovely alien woman almost getting a bit bashful.

""It uh. Was a very popular trend to eat valsin with your spouse or someone similar when I was growing up. I also loved eating valsin the normal way, with everyone getting an individual portion like a sensible meal. So it was... something I always wanted to do.""

Evelyn's ears flatten as her voice grows quiet, like she realized she was admitting something very embarrassing all of the sudden.

""Well that's perfect then. I'm really excited to share that with you Evie.""

""Really?""

""Really. I told you, I want to make all my wives’ fantasies and dreams come true. Whatever that might entail. Whether it's motherhood, career aspirations, something kinky in bed or just wanting to have a special little date like you always wanted since you were a girl, I'm here for you, and for your sisters of course.""

Evie grins over at Jerry, carefully picking up the utensils, which again, resembled chopsticks but one stick, which Evie held low, was clearly sharpened to a point, and had a notch on it.

""Hmmm. I can think of something else you can help me check off the list then, but after we eat. So to eat with these...""

Jerry holds his utensils up, carefully held in one hand.

""Like this? We have something similar back on Earth.""

""Mostly. You want the notch on the lower of the pair to be within comfortable reach of your thumb so you can 'shoot' the pointy part forward to spear food. There's a cultural context there that may once have involved live or near live food among coastal dwellers on the home world, but that's supposition and guesswork. The real reason was lost before we were uplifted, and all the upheaval from being uplifted ensured it would stay lost.""

Evelyn demonstrates, neatly spearing a chunk of meat and some vegetables and bringing it to her mouth.

The motion was a bit odd, but with a little practice Jerry manages to spear his first chunk of meat and wolfs it down. The taste was fascinating. The broth was quite flavorful by galactic standards, meaning it needed salt, but was otherwise fairly pleasant. The meat itself really did taste somewhat beef like, which helped flavor the broth as well. The rest of the flavors were slightly citrus-esque. Like someone had made pho and gone heavy on the lime juice for some reason. He gets some noodles next, finding them to have a pleasant chew, and to have absorbed flavor aggressively from the broth.

Overall it was a very tasty dish... but if it was supposed to be for lovers... Jerry spears another piece of meat and brings it up for Evie to eat.

""Hand feeding me now?""

""Well you did say valsin served this way is for lovers.""

Evelyn does her best to keep her face controlled, but Jerry can see her tail thrashing behind her, ruining the calm she was trying to project as she gives him an angelic smile.

""I suppose so. Thank you darling.""

She delicately takes the meat from the skewer and chews slowly, savoring it before bringing her own utensil back to the bowl.

""What bit would you like next Jerry?""

""Some of the vegetables I haven't tried yet, oh and tell me a bit more about them?""

""Of course! This one is...""

It was a moment of peaceful intimacy that fueled Jerry's soul as surely as food fueled his body. Still, even basking in the warmth of Evelyn's affection, he couldn't shake that trouble was brewing on Nar'Korek, and getting closer every day.

That however was a problem he couldn't solve now, and he determinedly puts the thoughts from his mind and focuses solely on what matters most to him instead. 

Tomorrow Jerry would just have to deal with whatever happened as best he could. His ship was strong. His team was skilled. All he could do now was rest, and be ready.

I know I should be talking to a doctor about this, not reddit. But my doctor is going to take two weeks until I can see them. I’ve been feeling just overwhelming exhaustion. I can sleep up to 10+ hours and I still feel awful, any less sleep and I feel like mentally I’m not there, like I can’t concentrate, or do anything. It’s been like this for a few years now (I got blood work done when it first started and my doctor said I was fine, it was just anxiety) but lately even coffee isn’t helping me anymore. 

I now feel sick in my stomach most the time, have heart palpitations, and headaches and pressure in my head. I feel like I can’t function at all anymore. I start a new job in 3 weeks and I’m concerned that I won’t be able to function there. My head is just constantly dazed and I feel awful and have zero energy, I can barely workout right now or enjoy anything I used to. I’m in a state of constant exhaustion. 

I’m wondering if anyone has any thoughts about what could be going on, or if anyone has dealt with something similar and figured it out. 

I do have pretty bad anxiety but my doctor has never recommended that I take anything for it and says I seem to handle it well. So my concern is that I’m dealing with something not anxiety related. ",1,1737753580.0,AskDocs,10,0.67,False

Then when the bowel movement stops the extreme pain stops as well, it leaves me with an slight stomach ache but nothing terrible. 

I tought I had gotten better because last year I would have those attacks once or twice a month and for the last 5 months it stopped. When I had those attacks frequently, I stopped eating and I lost a considerable amount of weight, I was afraid of being alone because I didn’t want to have to deal with those attacks by myself. I was constantly scared of the pain and couldn’t do much. it seemed to have stopped for a few months but now it’s back and I’m afraid. 

The pain is terrible, it’s the worst thing I’ve ever felt and the anxiety is related to the pain which sucks because I can’t do anything about it. 

I can’t really work because I always end up having to spend so much time in the bathroom. IBS isn’t considered as something that’s “bad” for most people it’s a mild inconvenience but for me, it’s ruining my life.

Im M29. Recently taking mirtazapine 45mg, now reduced to 30mg for reasons below.

A couple of weeks ago I started having these weird episodes at night where I suddenly woke up from what felt like some kind of seizure. It's dificult to describe. Almost like I knew if I closed my eyes that I would lose conciousness and die - I had to quickly get up and start moving to snap out of it.

I've been getting these episodes almost every night. If not at mid-night then early in the morning. I feel fine during the day apart from a couple days of feeling lightheaded/drowsy. Its worth mentioning that I have anxiety related to career and education/upcoming exam.

One night I was so scared that I admitted myself to urgent care at which point they took the standard stephoscope test and ecg (the sticker and wire thing) the results came back fine and they sent me home.

I went to the GP and after thorough examinatio been advised that it's exclusively attributed to stress. I have a blood test arranged.

Two nights ago I took my mirtazapine pill after a long night of strong coffee and studying and found I had very strong episodes of the above. This time I homed in and focussed exactly on what was happening - its almost like my heart stops beating - I jump up and do the regular thing to snap out of it.

Recently I read the leaflet with my mirtazapine pill and started doing research on the tortades pointes and LTQS syndrome and my symptoms seem to match up to that. I'm terrified that one of these nights I might not survive.

Could the doctor at urgent care and my GP missed this or disregarded the possibility? Do my symptoms match up with what you guys are going through? Any insite or advise on what to do to survive through the weekend verh welcome. Thankyou.",0,1737753547.0,lqts,2,0.5,False

It’s based on a group of rich highs school girls in LA. It’s not The Clique. I’m tried google and chatgpt and I cant even find a pic of the cover. I remember this:

They all had super rich families. One girl was a blonde stoner troublemaker and her dad was a plastic surgeon who had an Aphrodite statue in his yard. 
The plot of the first book was something like this: new girl and her brother joined a new private high school in Cali on scholarship. The new girl was an artist and every few chapters they book would include a fashion sketch or a sketch of hers illustrating the girls, outfits, etc. She ate at Baja fresh a lot. 

I remember the rich popular girls took her on because of her sketches and the plot follows them starting their own fashion label, and marketing it by throwing parties and events and so on. 

They shopped a lot on rodeo drive. 
One of the girls spilled hot coffee on herself and then spilled the rest of her coffee all over herself on the first day of school and made it a fashion statement. And there was a sketch about it in the book. I remember they did all sorts of things to promote their fashion label. Honestly I can’t remember much else

That’s really all I can remember. I remember I waS FASCINATED by the sketches. I think the series is made of 3-4 books. The first one had like a white background with the main rich girl on it wearing yellow and I think she was brunette. But I could be wrong!

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I’m not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I’m not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zUFNfnA)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

From top to bottom, this draft is 441 words. I’d like help identifying what I need to cut, if anything.

Another concern: my biggest inspirations for this book were The Reader by Bernhard Schlink and My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell. That doesn’t necessarily make them good comps though. I am interested to hear which books this query triggers you to think of, especially if they are minority/LGBTQ-based stories. Thanks! 

Dear agent,

I am seeking representation for Boy, a diverse contemporary complete at 75,000 words. Taking place primarily in 2008, it centers on a consequential year in a young man’s adolescence and the fallout of relationships that grounded him. Boy is suited for fans of *blank* and *blank*, with themes of friendship and loyalty, injustice and trauma, identity, and familial discord, ultimately painting an answer to the question: what becomes of a person with a childhood ended too soon (alternatively—an innocence taken too soon)?

Eighteen-year-old Malcolm Kelly is good. He’s good-natured, a good son, student, and friend with a good head on his shoulders. Like most high school seniors, he balances being carefree with preparing for the future—gaining experience in his father’s dental practice, attending the occasional house party, studying for the ACT, and frequenting Bernie’s, the local sub shop, with his vibrant and closeted best friend, Noelle. He’s already got his next few years mapped out: undergrad and then dental school at the University of Michigan, just like his father. 

But as the leaves change color, so does his life. The truth of his father’s affair comes out, wrecking his parents’ marriage overnight and challenging everything he thought he knew about the man he reveres. Noelle finally likes a girl who likes her back. And then there’s Jane—prideful and secretive Jane—the assistant manager of Bernie’s and nine years Malcolm’s senior. 

It begins innocently enough: his quips to help her pass the time, accompanying her on her smoke breaks. Being black in a predominantly white area and getting a kick out of creating ridiculous stories about Bernie’s customers seem to be the only things Malcolm and Jane have in common, but he admires her self-possession. They go from sharing cigarettes to sharing her bed, igniting a rebellion that has Malcolm chipping away at his world little by little until, in a bitter act of betrayal, he breaks it completely. In the years that follow, he’s left to face the reality that he never really knew Jane at all, not even her real name, and forced to confront the feelings he always denied for the sake of the friendship most important to him. 

Set in the fictional midwestern locale of Red Pine, Minnesota, Boy is a coming-of-age distinct in its sharp interpersonal focus and tender exploration of love and intimacy in all its forms.

I was born and raised in the Twin Cities. I have been a licensed dental assistant for six years and hobbyist writer for fourteen. Boy is my debut. I am happy to provide my full manuscript upon request.

I appreciate your time and look forward to hearing from you.

**First 300:**

Noelle walked out the coffee shop when I honked my horn, her sweatshirt balled up in the crook of her elbow, her backpack slung over her shoulder. The barista uniform was a black logotyped t-shirt tucked into a pair of jeans, non-mesh sneakers, fine brown hair finger-combed into a loose ponytail and a visor with her nametag pinned. She plopped down in my passenger seat, filling the car with her scent—burnt brew and a body mist that tried to imitate cherries.

“Hey,” she said. Her voice had a natural rasp that made it sound like she was always sick. Her face was open, friendly, and her cheeks went big when she smiled. She buckled in, then reached inside her Jansport for a piece of Wrigley's Doublemint.

Noelle liked rituals; she gave me gum each time I saw her. The first was in first grade. She was one of fifteen new classmates and I knew only three things about her then: her name, she was quiet, and her dad cleaned the bathrooms at our school. One day early in the year, we all sat in a circle on the floor after recess, our short legs crossed in front of us. Mrs. Henry pulled out her plastic activity bin and instructed us to grab a buddy. I had a few buddies. They all had better buddies. 

I glanced around the circle as each kid linked to another. Noelle surprised me when she crawled over and landed at my side. She smelled like sand. I looked from her dark eyes down to her knees, which were red and stippled where the rough commercial carpet had dug in.

“Do you like gum?” she asked. Her fingers slid into the front pocket of her shorts and inched out a sleeve of Big Red to show me.

I was cleaning up my Spotify today, removing our playlists. I did delete them, but not before taking screenshots of each one because I couldn’t bear to lose those precious memories entirely.

There’s one song I came across that took me straight back to your home. I could see fields and fields of corn, you driving me in your red car to your dad’s house. We were laughing, eating, and listening to music. I can picture you pushing open the door of your house, heading to water the plants. Then you’d make your favorite coffee and prepare matcha for me.

I see you sitting on the couch, feet tucked up, all curled up in that way only you could manage. We’d watch our favorite show, maybe go for a walk later, hand in hand.

These might seem like simple, everyday moments. But to me, they’re extraordinary. They’re woven into what used to be us.

1i960c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1i960c5/red_dead_redemption_3/,Red dead Redemption 3.,"Posted this yesterday last night but it got only 2 views

I know alot of you will disagree but it is my opinion that a ground up Red Dead Revolver would be a perfect third installment to the red dead redemption series please please please read this and I would love to hear your opinions. I know it is super long. I hope you enjoy it!!

 I understand that I am obsessing so much over something that I have absolutely no control over. It would be so perfect but I know rockstar will not do it and they would rather create another IP but I don't know how good the story would be cast under the shadow of RDR2 I hope it takes more of a spaghetti western approach, 1870s/1880s wild West would be an amazing setting for an open world video game. RDR2 was so good because RDR1 exists. RDR1 was so good because there was never a game quite like it. I rewrote the Red Dead Revolver(2004) story. I wrote a Google doc that is 12 pages long. I describe how the game would work in an open world setting with a very very large map. The story is changed to add some humanity and emotion to Red Harlow and the characters from RDREVOLVER and explore his story. I also describe how the gameplay, visuals, and cinematography would change and look. 

Landon Ricketts serves as a the mentor to a 17-20 year old Red Harlow and guides Red on his journey for vengeance and teaches Red valuable lessons about how to survive in the wild West. In missions Landon Ricketts will tell Harlow what to do and how to progress through the mission but is really Landon is guiding the player, his voice lines could change depending on how good the player is. Ricketts and Harlow would have a dynamic like Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood in ""for a few dollars more"". Jack Swift will also be a very integral part of the story and Red's life. Jack Swift along with Harlow and Ricketts form a trio that works to bring in large bounties. Jack Swift will have different motivations then Red or Landon making him more of a murder for hire. This will cause a disconnect between swift and the other two because Landon views Swift as dishonorable. Later on after a high reward bounty Hunt mission Swift finds himself confused because this kill was far too easy and then upon investigation finds out that the man he has killed was nothing but an innocent man who had the misfortune of being a former business partner of Governor Griffon. The guilt and knowledge of what he has done severely impacts Jack Swift starts an arc that sees him becoming more sympathetic and much less greedy. He, Landon, and Red eventually became very very good friends as Swift's motivations shift from greed to a desire for true justice and personal hatred of governor Griffon. 

The true villains such as General Diego, Governor Griffon, and Colonel Darren are already very compelling antagonists and each will get more focus than they did previously in RDRevolver. General Diego's character must be grounded slightly and the battle of Rio Grande will be reworked to feel like something that actually could have happened in the political climate and historical backdrop of the 1870s. Griffon is the perfect antagonist for Red, he has the polar opposite ideals of Red Harlow. The game will begin on the hunt for Colonel Darren but then will quickly realize there are people much more evil than Darren such as General Diego who Darren is the right hand man of and then eventually Governor Griffon the main antagonist of Red Dead Redemption 3. A character named Silas Thorne will be added as the nemesis of Landon Ricketts and Red must aid Landon on bringing down the Thorne gang.  Thorne will be a secondary antagonist similar to Colm O'Driscoll in RDR2. Thorne has the highest bounty in the game with the hardest missions and the most skilled and dangerous gang. When this entire questline is complete Thorne is killed by Ricketts after being beaten in combat by Red but Red did not kill him immediately so that Ricketts could fire the finishing blow. The Thorne gang will slowly fall apart without leadership breaking into two fairly large gangs then into several smaller gangs often clashing amongst eachother the fate of the Thorne gang will be available to read about in the newspaper 

The player will meet and have the option to recruit several gunslingers to the camp each character can change the story in different ways, perhaps some of the men you hire are outlaws that attract unwanted attention or may betray you, one of the skills Landon Ricketts teaches young Harlow is how to read people's intentions based on body language and language cues. Advanced 3d capture will allow each AI to show physical and audible cues that the character may be untrustworthy or lying to you. The player will have the ability to bring camp members along for missions and each character will react differently in each mission and some may die if you choose the wrong member for the wrong mission effectively killing the character and erasing them from the game. Red Harlow will have to team up with his camp members for a chance against large groups of enemies. However If Landon Ricketts dies then the game will end and count as a player death, and the player will have to restart the mission. If Jack Swift, Annie Stoakes, buffalo soldier, or red wolf ""Die"" in combat on a mission they are not supposed to die they will only be injured and can be rescued if the player does not rescue them then Landon Ricketts will. 

When the main storyline is complete Red will have different honor endings 

[High honor] Red retires from gunslinging after having fulfilled his vengeance and seeing his share of pain he decides to settle down on a ranch he finds love and builds a family and truly does live happily ever after. Red is able to be visited and talked with. There are activities at Red's ranch like horseshoe toss, drinking, target practice, and horse racing. 

[Medium honor] Red dies fighting US soldiers and Pinkertons in the governor's mansion the army surrounds you but is unable to best your shooting they then decide to burn the mansion killing Red and leaving no remains but ash and his revolver glowing red hot on the ground the camera focuses on the red revolver before shadow wolf sneaks his way back to see what remains of his cousin he sees the revolver and grabs it intentionally burning his hand and promptly wrapping it in a red bandana in memory of his cousin. He cools off the revolver with mud and then puts it in his satchel. Red is frequently talked about in the dialogue and his death made newspaper headlines for weeks. Red is remembered as a complicated individual but also revered as brave, skilled, and kind-hearted man by his friends and strangers alike 

[Low honor ending] in a low honor ending Red will die a similar death as the medium honor death but rather than dying in the mansion Red will take to a balcony and use dead eye to kill as many soldiers as possible before taking nearly 50 rounds to the body he falls from the balcony and his body is claimed by a bounty hunter who was hired to aid the US army in tracking and killing you, the camera follows your corpse closely as it is transported the bounty Hunter gets attacked and fends off the bandits but we are not able to see it as the camera is still focused on Red's corpse. The wagon moves again and cuts to the same shot again but only now in the dark of night and then once again it is light. The bounty Hunter arrives at a sheriff's office and he says ""it's a shame what happened to Red he used to be a good kid, take him on up to boot hill"" his body is then taken up to an old boot hill cemetery and then buried as the casket closes the light disappears into darkness and the screen goes black

Landon Ricketts will become the Playable character as he begins mentoring his new pupil a young man by the name Frank Heck. The game will progress as you mentor Frank until he is even faster than Ricketts. The gameplay from here on out will be essentially free-play with very cooperative interaction mechanics with Frank you will be able to give him orders but if he dies it will count as a player death. Frank will handle the close up brawls while Landon covers him from a distance close enough that if he needed to help Frank he could. But it all depends on the player's playstyle 

High honor ending-
Red will be available to visit on his ranch and as Landon Ricketts you may convince Red to assist you and Frank on a quest or a bounty. Red will decline sometimes especially if his wife is present who will actively attempt to dissuade him as you try to convince him. Red may refuse but typically doesn't hesitate to ride again with his old friends. I believe this game should end on a lighter note than RDR1 or 2. Landon Ricketts with the help of Frank Heck will continue gunslinging into his elderly years and Red with his vendettas fulfilled has moved on from a life of violence to a life of peace but red never hung up his Revolver. Red may at times ask Landon for help around the ranch with rustling cattle sparking dialogue between the two suggesting that it is a transaction so that Red embarks on another adventure with Landon Ricketts every so often. But the truth is Red would have gone regardless just to watch his older brother Landon's back. When Red is off his ranch and riding with you he will act like a member of the gang and can hang out at the camp but he will not participate in robberies he will only do bounties. When Red returns to camp the gang celebrates and they begin partying. Red can only stay at the camp for a certain amount of time and must return with 4 game days of leaving his ranch 

New features like various drugs of the wild West that provide different effects, some of them are going to affect gameplay while ayahuasca and peyote offer surreal existential cinematic and at times emotional effects. On ayahuasca Red will be transported to the desert and visited by a ghostly apparition of a native American warrior/shaman and he will walk beside Red and tell the player about Red's past while also subtly foreshadowing the future of the game's story and also speaking of John Marston and Arthur Morgan in archaic riddles that Red will not understand but the player will. On peyote ghosts of deceased characters such as his parents and his friends who die along the story line who the player may grow fond of. That way the character never truly dies and still exists in some form. He will also be visited by the ghosts of people he's killed including the bounties who red takes on during his journey. Red and Landon form complicated and at times amicable and respectful relations with enemies they had slain as they had a mutual understanding of each other. In the medium and low honor ending Landon will be able to talk to the ghost of Red Harlow via Peyote. A high honor Landon talking with a medium honor red would have dialogue about the good times they had together and Landon reminds Harlow of the good deeds  he had done in his short time here on earth. There will be different Red and Landon honor combinations allowing different dialogue options that not every player will experience the same dialogue. Each player will get a unique and fresh gaming experience every time they start from the beginning. 

There will also be different kinds of beers and alcohols each making the player act a different kind of drunk. The player can get cross faded with different drugs and alcoholic beverages leading to different effects on the player's physical health, mental health, and vulnerability stat. While cross faded on ayahuasca or peyote you will be thrown into a dream like loopy state in the dessert surrounded by men with guns and you must kill the men and as you sober up you hear your name being called, one of the gang members with the most seniority will have found you and then will scold and ridicule you for your behavior as you realize you were shooting at nothing and he or she will take you back to camp on horseback. A cutscene will play with the player making drunk conversation drifting in and out of sleep while your friend listens to your drunken babbling trying to keep you from falling asleep and falling off the horse as you ride back to camp and then get sent to bed. In the morning the player will wake up with a serious hangover and the player must drink alot of coffee to stop the effects or wait 6 game hours. 

I Reworked all the minor antagonists to make them fit in with the HD universe for example; 

Pig josh will be renamed Joshua Swine. He will be a 6foot 7 giant who is muscular instead of fat, and wears a tattered old confederate coat and hat. He throws dynamite strategically rather than exploding himself and inexplicably not taking damage. He will also have goons that throw dynamite and have a suicide vest as well. The fight will progress in 4 stages with him becoming more volatile each phase, the third stage will have Joshua remove his coat revealing the dynamite strapped to his chest. The fourth and final phase will see pig Josh will say his signature line ""I'm gonna blow you up real good cowboy"" he lights his dynamite vest and then charges at you very fast paying homage to Josh's original move. In this phase the player must land 2 consecutive headshots and clear the blast radius of Josh. After the battle a cutscene will depict the blast then a billow of smoke rises into the air and something falls from the sky, it is the now charred confederate hat of Joshua Swine. The hat lands at Red's feet and he brings the hat to Sherrif Bartley's to collect the bounty reward. All the campy cartoon minor villains that appear at the beginning of the game have been rewritten and reworked to feel serious while still retaining the charm and humor of Red Dead Revolver's spaghetti western inspired villains. 

All bounties aside from Joshua Swine can only be collected by loading corpses onto a cart or the rump of your horse and bandits called body hunters will try to steal your bounties. All the original minor antagonists will have longer missions with multiple quests and multiple interactions with the villain creating a greater sense of character. Each character will have a visually distinct gang which attacks the player and NPCs the gangs will also clash with eachother. Once the boss has been defeated the gang is dissolved and it can be read about in the newspaper. Other smaller outlaw bands will also run rampant ensuring a chance for chaos around every corner.

Other bounty Hunters will exist creating a sense of rivalry with their names appearing on the newspaper and at times brushing shoulders with rival bounty Hunters. If you become medium or low honor you will have bounties on your head and may have bounty Hunters attack your camp as your gang sleeps. Some of the bounty Hunters can be recruited but they may not necessarily be the most trustworthy of people and may betray you in any number of ways. Low honor leads to more frequent attacks and a higher bounty on your head placing you as the second highest bounty in the game right below Thorne.

The camp will have upgradeable defenses such as alarm systems, dogs, explosives, and sentry positions and you can assign camp members different duties such as guard or Sentry duty. Some characters will be more proficient in certain skills than others such as vigilance, marksmanship, strength, riding skills, stamina, agility, intelligence, dexterity, cooking, tracking, etc... so they can be assigned jobs accordingly to ensure the gang is running smoothly and healthily. Leisure activities will be played by the gang members to keep their nerves down, such as gambling, friendly boxing, storytelling, cooking around the campfire, horse racing, shooting contests, drinking contests, smoking cigarettes, smoking marijuana and drinking with the fellow gang members around the campfire. Some gang members will refuse to participate or may react negatively to certain activities.

1i95zv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i95zv2/going_nc_with_aunt_after_she_betrayed_me/,Going nc with aunt after she betrayed me?,"I (34F) grew up in a pretty unstable environment. My mom passed away over 20 years ago, living in my household wasn't easy and there always was drama in my extended family. I've been living abroad for many years now.

Most of my family was never supportive, always criticised my choices. I am the first one to have a degree (I actually have two) and to move abroad, so I guess they don't have the mental openness to understand me. For example, when I mentioned I was moving to a new country for work (I lived in different places), I was laughed at straight to my face and told ""I have no home"", or when I opened a business, I was told that they didn't believe it would be successful and it was destined to fail. Despite all this, I believe to have built a decent life for myself. And with time, I learned to take my distance from these people.

Fast forward to a few months ago, I lived together with the man whom I thought was the love of my life. We were very happy. Then he found a very good job in his home country and told me to follow him there as soon as possible so we could finally have our family and children. After a couple months I quit my job, sent a notice to leave my apartment, and only a few weeks before reuniting he sent me a message saying that he loved me but was overwhelmed by my arrival, was afraid to let me down, and it was better to let me go so I could find someone who could give me the love and stability I deserve. I already knew he felt he was not good enough for me, but I always reassured him, and there were no warnings before the breakup, he never communicated anything to me about it. I was blindsided. Heartbroken, homeless, jobless. I had wonderful friends who helped me with housing while I looked for another job. I thought I could do better financially, as the country I was living in is pretty expensive especially for a single woman who doesn't share a house, so I looked for a place with a better balance salary-cost of life, and I found it in a couple of months and went back to my home country to prepare my visa.

I was happy for the job but still emotionally messed up due to what happened, so I thought to meet my relatives next time I visit as I was too vulnerable to talk with them now. I am not good at lying and I knew that I would start crying once asked ""how are you?"". After a while not visiting her, one of my aunts (55F) called me and asked me to meet for a coffee. She was the aunt who had helped me the most among them growing up, and even though there were a couple episodes that made me lose trust, I still had some hope with her and thought that maybe she cared about me, so I agreed. As predicted, I cried when she asked me how things were. I decided to give her a chance and told her what happened. Then she said to text her to meet again, and left to meet my other aunt (first red flag). Long story short, I texted her shortly after, and she never replied. My cousins (her daughters) texted me out of the blue after some days (they never do - other red flag) to casually talk, but I cut it short as I felt they were getting in contact with me because they were told about my coming move and wanted to benefit from it. So, even though I have no certainty of this, I felt like my aunt didn't care about me and just met me to know my business and spread gossip around. I felt fooled, betrayed. After 12 days I got to know from the only relatives I trust that she was asking around about me. Then I met her by chance the day after, which was not really by chance but her asking where I was and coming there. When I saw her, I asked her ""is everything ok? I texted you and you didn't reply"" and she said that she maybe saw the message but had her mind in the clouds a bit, but basically flipped the script and made it about me not going to her house, so the fault was mine since I didn't visit her. I told her no, that I was waiting for her to reply to me. Of course I could have visited her or sent her a reminder, but the thing is that I am tired of chasing people and beg for attention. She said to text her. I texted her. She didn't reply. That's it. She then said that my cousins will come to visit me once I am settled, confirming that she talked about our conversation at least with them (if she said it to my other aunt I will never know).

Sometimes I feel bad for wanting to go nc because I do have some nice memories with her growing up, but I am so tired of this. I did so much to build a life for myself, create my boundaries, heal from my traumas, find balance and feel happy and at peace, but every time I come back home I feel like the teenager of 20 - 15 years ago. Am I right not to trust this aunt? Fortunately I will leave in a couple weeks, but the same problem will present itself next time I visit, hopefully in a long time.",1,1737752750.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I alternate between constipation and softer (not quite diarrhea) stools. When I’m constipated it sucks but I can fonction properly, the problem comes with the softer stools. Sometimes (it’s random it seems but only when I have softer stools) when I have to go to the bathroom I get these terrible stomachs pain, but I’m talking about TERRIBLE! I get chills, I’m sweating and I start shaking, I almost passed out multiple times. Then when the bowel movement stops the extreme pain stops as well, it leaves me with an slight stomach ache but nothing terrible. 

I tought I had gotten better because last year I would have those attacks once or twice a month and for the last 5 months it stopped. When I had those attacks frequently, I stopped eating and I lost a considerable amount of weight, I was afraid of being alone because I didn’t want to have to deal with those attacks by myself. I was constantly scared of the pain and couldn’t do much. it seemed to have stopped for a few months but now it’s back and I’m afraid. 

The pain is terrible, it’s the worst thing I’ve ever felt and the anxiety is related to the pain which sucks because I can’t do anything about it. 

I can’t really work because I always end up having to spend so much time in the bathroom. IBS isn’t considered as something that’s “bad” for most people it’s a mild inconvenience but for me, it’s ruining my life. 

I’m tired of this pain and anxiety, I want to be able to work a full time job or be able to spend one day without having stomach issues…. 

(I’ve tried everything: consulting doctors, endoscopy, colonoscopy, gastroenterologists, general doctor, changing diets, no more gluten, no more soy, no dairy, no spicy food, no coffee, I’ve tried probiotics, mint tablets, tea, dicyclomine, benzos, meditation, buying a little stool to put my feets on when I go to the bathroom, wearing less tight clothing, heating pads, …..) 

A friend of my mother reached out to me and told me she had similar pain with endometriosis but whenever I talk to my gynaecologist about it she says she’s convinced it’s not that but I’ve had no tests.

I also have GERD but I don’t think it can cause this type of pain…

I don’t know what to do anymore, I can’t function anymore because of this. I’m sorry for the rant, I just need to express this feeling to someone. ",6,1737752683.0,ibs,5,1.0,False

1i95wwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1i95wwa/not_verizon_originally_posted_on_my_newsletter/,Not Verizon -- Originally Posted on My Newsletter and on WSB,"# Should your personal experience with a company or brand influence your trading decisions?

I mean, I used to think **VZ** was one of those bellwether stocks that you couldn't go wrong buying or selling. They were affordable. Their options actually translated into value. Numbers generally looked ok.

What was not to like? Then I had a really negative customer experience with Verizon. I am actually contemplating legal action. Yes, it really was **that bad**.

But then again, I am just one person out of millions of customers. Taking my own personal experience as the measure and standard of a company's future growth potential seems a little egocentric. I mean, we all know that Warren Buffett invested in American Express because they covered his bill at lunch one time at a restaurant, but that was decades ago.

I am curious about other people's recent customer experiences with VZ (and no, I'm not really trolling for my legal case). Not even being disingenuous about that. I am actually **genuinely impressed** with their business model. So many tech companies are afraid to hire people and have the type of Main Street presence that is typical and ubiquitous for banks, coffee joints, and fast food.

And then there is the general philosophical question...

I’m a caffeine fiend, I wouldn’t be surprised if I was drinking 7-10 cups daily. It probably shouldn’t be a shock that I’m feeling withdrawal symptoms. 

The odd thing about it all is I don’t drink coffee on the weekends, and I have no signs of withdrawals. It makes me wonder if it’s due to altering a ritual. 

I’m hanging in there, I went for a walk to the gas station for a Gatorade during my lunch break. It was a decent enough day, 40 degrees and sunny. I felt like some time in the sun alleviated my fatigue for a bit.

Some suggestions I have:

1. Customizable menus/ posters/ pamphlets: which you can grab and inspect closer. 


2. Food wrapping: where you can grab a bunch of items and use a machine to put everything in a bag/ box. So something like the trays we have but instead of holding a tray with a bunch of food, we’re holding a take out bag/ box with food


3. Customizable logos: (using decals) on mugs, take out boxes, trays etc


4. Customizable Billboards around town: where you pay to put your advertisement up


5. Customizable party invite feature: the current party invite feature but using decals (Roblox censors out inappropriate decals so it’s not going to be that bad). This would make the party invites more personal and better.


6. Customizable menu items: this could be tricky. But some items like cake, coffee etc can be such a way where the plot owner can make their own drinks/ cakes/ cupcakes based on the colors and flavours and can be used on the menu and make it a permanent recipe for their own plot. (Idk how to explain help)


7. Outfit mannequin: where you can load outfits for staff (using clothes codes) and people can wear it just by clicking. This will be useful in schools, and can also be used in clothes stores. Since this could be complicated, they can make it only for classic clothes.


8. Doors with keypad locks: this can be helpful for hotels so that only the guests can access the room.


9. Global event feature: so this is like the party feature, but it’s available for all servers. Like the public neighborhood feature but there’s a separate tab for all the current ongoing events.


10. Business kiosk: stay with me cuz this might be confusing. So basically imagine you own a cafe in bloxburg and you want to make a kiosk for that cafe. You get a designated space to build a kiosk and customize it according to your preferences. Now you can advertise your kiosks to other people who can buy it at their plots. For eg: people with stadiums, malls, zoos, schools etcs can buy your kiosk and you get a share of the buying cost + your brand can be promoted.


11. Phones! A lot of business features can be added to the phone- like customizable apps (Im getting too ambitious yall, bloxburg cant even fix the glitching grass and im talking about apps😭), business reviews, hiring ads etc. 


This is all I can think of, but if you guys have any businesses and have any features that you would like to see added, drop your ideas",3,1737752157.0,Bloxburg,0,1.0,False
1i95q77,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1i95q77/i_got_sober_at_26_5_years_ago_here_is_why_i/,"I got sober at 26, 5 years ago. Here is why I regret it.","I knew I’d have to go back after my first AA meeting because this little old dear club to me like a koala. She was 40 years sober, so naturally someone must have been paying her to go there. She harped on about how special I was, that I was the most important person in the room, that she could really really use some help with teas and coffees next week. Poor love, I thought. 

I went back the follow week rough as a bag of hedgehogs, I was so hungover my eyes were pointing in different directions. The old dear had no idea, despite the fact I reeked of cigarettes and cheap rose wine. I knew for a fact my cute 26 year old ass wasn’t sitting in that church room with a bunch of stinkers for the next fourty years. I have the tea made for me, I am a not a tea maker - I simply do not belong here. I helped her with the teas and coffees and internally gave myself a pat on the back. Only my second meeting and it would have fallen apart without me. 


Dorris or whatever her name was, was doing the chair that night. On and on she went. I left wondering what kind of prescription could cure my utter insanity. There had to be some sort of injection or hypnotherapy, maybe a warm yoga that could expel the curse bestowed upon me. By now you’ll have guessed, cheeky old Dorris tricked me into sticking around.  The stinkers weren’t so bad after all, they didn’t even stink. 

I couldn’t hold together a sentence, let along sobriety for a week. I couldn’t pay my bills, I couldn’t hold down a friendship, I couldn’t sleep without a bucket next to the bed. I lay awake at night praying a heart attack would take me, a comet would squash me, the postman would mow me down. Anything. 

Do you know today, I laughed so much I cried real tears? My friend pronounced the word ‘cuisine’ as ‘crewzeen’ and I just totally lost it. How stupid is that? How utterly ridiculous and joyful it is to be silly and to not be resentful that I have to wake up. I baked a cake so bad last week that my big sister couldn’t stop laughing and it sent the whole family into hysterics, including me. It was awful, sinfully bad. An assassination attempt my father said. 

We do not have regrets. We can not afford the luxury of regrets, we have experiences, some better than others. I wanted to go to sleep tonight extending my inner joy to those who feel so unloved, empty, hollow and done that they can’t hold down a meal. To those who are a few years sober and feel a bit lost, to those fourty years sober making tea. 

Baby you got this. Joy will come to you, then it will go, then it will come back again. We cant stop waves of emotions but we can tie our little dinghy’s together and give ourselves a good old shot at staying afloat. 

Anyway, regret. i’ve got to call out the bingo numbers tomorrow at Dorrises nursing home which I’ve been strictly told must not be rushed and can take up to 2.5 hours. I shit you not, I’m reconsidering all life’s choices right now.

I groaned and clasped my head as my eyes slowly, begrudgingly, fluttered open. The world came into focus a bit too slowly for my liking, and I smacked my lips in a vain effort to get rid of that acrid taste in the back of my throat. I grabbed a glass of water from the nightstand and pressed it to my lips, and the next thing I knew I was uncontrollably guzzling it down.

Yep. I was hungover.

Looking back, I didn’t really remember much of the night before. It’s a good thing, then, that I found a note left next to the glass of water.

“Hey there,

Thanks for the good time tonight! Shame about the ending, but oh well. Judging by how much of a challenge it was to get you into bed, I’m willing to bet you won’t remember a lot of the last couple hours, so just as a refresher: your car’s in the bar parking lot, I gave you a ride home, your shirt and pants are in the washing machine.”

Looking down at myself, I became aware that I was only wearing undergarments.

“I didn’t look, don’t you worry. I just figured that you’d rather not sleep in your own vomit, but sorry for the indignity nonetheless. It was nice talking to you, and good luck with your whole ‘solar system wall’ thing. If you need a ride back to the bar to pick up your car, just call me. -Devon.”

Written below the note was a phone number. I considered for a couple moments before shooting the number a message asking for a ride. I could always just call a rideshare, but any excuse not to spend money was welcome. Who knew what was going to happen to my job…

Besides… I needed to figure out how much I’d told Devon. The last thing I needed was any further legal trouble on top of the potential legal trouble I was already in. With a huff, I got up, threw back an ibuprofen that was next to the cup of water, and started up a pot of coffee.

“Well, morning sunshine!” Devon said with far too much enthusiasm as I climbed into the passenger seat. I adjusted my sunglasses and immediately rested my head against the window. “Feelin’ like a million bucks, huh?”

“Not… not so loud,” I complained. Devon chuckled a little as the car shifted into motion.

“That sounds about right,” Devon said with a noticeable softness to his tone. “You really went at it last night. You were pounding back beers like you had something to prove. How do you even stomach that stuff, by the way, that stuff was-” I waved angrily at him, doing my best to non verbally tell him to shut up.

“Dude, don’t… don’t talk about alcohol right now, I feel like I’m gonna puke just thinking about it,” I weakly said. Devon nodded, smacking his lips a little, and he tapped his fingers against the steering wheel.

“Right, right, sorry. Well, if you do, just roll down the windows and do it over the side, please. I don’t feel like cleaning the inside of my car,” Devon responded. I grumbled, not speaking words so much as just conveying a feeling, and Devon seemed to receive the message. It took a couple minutes before my stomach settled to the moving car and light stimulation from outside, but eventually I was finally in a place where I could talk.

It was time to figure out what happened.

“Devon, what… what all did I say last night?” I asked with slight trepidation. Devon idly scratched his chin, running his fingers over some light scruff, and hummed in thought.

“Honestly, I couldn’t make it all out myself. You were, uh… pretty intoxicated.  You started with this weird story about a bubble, but eventually you started talking about some Sci-Fi story you were working on,” he said with a hint of confusion in his voice. I raised an eyebrow in response, a gesture he couldn’t see behind my sunglasses.

“Oh yeah? What did you think… of the story,” I asked hesitantly. I might as well play along, see just what exactly I’d said. He shrugged and pursed his lips.

“Certainly sounds like a neat concept. It’s a bit implausible though, isn’t it? A wall around the solar system… how d’ya explain comets? Radiation events? Y’know, bit of a hard pill to swallow.” I frowned. My theory had some holes, but… there were potential solutions. I couldn’t begin to speculate further without some solid evidence.

“Well,” I said with pursed lips. “It needn’t be a literal, physical wall. Maybe it’s a radiation belt,” I explained. “Or maybe it doesn’t cover everything. Maybe there are holes in it.” Devon hummed some more nodding.

“That could do it,” he said thoughtfully. I quietly contemplated the dilemma I faced. I could use an outside perspective…

“I could use your thoughts on something,” I said, rubbing my temples. All this thinking while hung over… not pleasant. “My protagonist is trying to convince some people about the whole wall thing… how should I write that?” Devon laughed, though he quieted down after I winced from the sharp noise.

“Well, your protag’s gonna have quite the uphill struggle. They’re gonna need some solid evidence.”

“Right,” I said in frustration. “But she can’t *get* more evidence without convincing people enough to get a probe launched… which… is basically impossible.” Devon shrugged.

“Well, NASA launches things all the time, right? I mean, they just did more Voyager probes like two years ago, right?” I winced at the reminder, hoping that Devon didn’t notice. If he did, he didn’t comment on it. “So, your protagonist could use false pretenses: come up with a different reason to get a probe where she wants one to be, a reason that’d be more acceptable to her superiors. Once she’s got the evidence she needs, she can leverage that.”

“Right,” I agreed. “But what kind of pretenses could convince NASA to expend the kind of resources necessary to prove such a thing? I would need to… I would need to *write* a convincing enough explanation that would-“ I suddenly jerked up, startling Devon.

“Jaysus, you all good there?” I grinned, pulling out my phone and opening the memo application.

“I got it.”

“Alright, Sarah: you mind telling me just what the *fuck* you did to get us in this much shit?”

I winced a little, pulling away from the chastising my boss was giving me. The rest of the weekend had been rather uneventful— I spent an inordinate amount of time just preparing for today— but no amount of preparation or planning could remove the sting from Kim’s glare. He always had a way of cutting right into your soul with just a look.

“Well,” I said with as much conviction as I could muster. “Director Braun wasn’t very fond of the Voyager program’s… ‘failure’… and nothing I could say would convince him to ease up on us. He’s starting to think maybe there was foul play in terms of allocation of funds. Embezzling or something, I dunno.” Kim’s eyes narrowed further, and he took a step closer to me.

“Right,” he said suspiciously. “And why am I hearing that their investigation is centering around you? What *exactly* did you say?” I pursed my lips. There was no getting around this. I needed to stand my ground, I needed to be confident. If I showed weakness, if I started to crumble, my plan would fail before it even began. Unfortunately, that almost certainly meant confrontation.

“You already know what I said,” I said simply. Kim bit his lower lip and held his head in his hands. Off to the right, I noticed Angela grin and rest her head in her right hand.

“C’mon Kim, lay off the poor girl. All the greatest discoveries sounded like insanity once upon a time. She might be the next Galileo, yeah?” There was a distinct tone of sarcasm to her voice, but I didn’t get the impression she was simply mocking me. Despite her less-than-enthused tone, I shot Angela a smile. Even if it was… shaky… any support at all was appreciated. She gave me a wink in response. “Besides, at least she gave Braun something to chew on. You think any explanation *you* could’ve given would have made him happy?”

“No,” Kim admitted. “But I wouldn’t have him thinking I’m insane!” Kim pinched the bridge of his nose and shook his head. “Why did he even want to speak with *you*, specifically? You’re just a data scientist, he should have been talking to the Voyager lead,” he said and gestured towards himself. I tapped my fingers against my leg nervously and chuckled.

“Well… that would be because I told him I had an explanation.” For a second, Kim looked like he was about to blow a gasket. After a moment, however, he sighed and chuckled.

“I mean… heh… you’re fired, of course.” I clenched my fist tightly as he shook his head. He muttered a bit to himself, though I couldn’t make out the words, then he looked back at me. “You threw the entire Voyager program under the bus… hell, I’ve got the Deep Space division climbing up my ass right now, even SMD is…” he shook his head.

“Wait. Before you fire me, there’s a much better way to use me,” I offered. I’d prepared for this eventuality… step one of my plan to expose the truth was to save myself. I couldn’t do anything if I was fired. “Director Braun is auditing the entire program, right? Maybe he’s even moving up the ladder and looking at division-wide examinations. We know we’re innocent, right? We’ll be cleared of suspicion soon enough. But in the meantime, if something else comes up… if Braun demands funding cuts… I can be your scapegoat.”

It wasn’t exactly an airtight defense, but it was what I had right now. As long as it kept me around a bit longer, I could make myself more valuable and leverage that for my continued employment.

“You get rid of me now,” I continued, “and you lose a bargaining chip when Braun comes knocking and demands action.” Kim wasn’t happy, but he did seem to be considering my proposal. Angela watched on, not even hiding the fact that she was enjoying this juicy conversation. That was just the kind of person she was. Kim hummed, his fingers on his chin, as he paced briefly and thought to himself.

“Besides, I have an idea for a propaganda win that could offset the sting of this defeat,” I concluded. That got Kim’s attention. He raised an eyebrow and looked at me, silently prompting me to go on. I gestured to a nearby poster we had hanging up of the solar system. I traced the path of Voyager out through the various planets beyond the asteroid belt. “We keep sending probes out this way to gather data, right? It makes sense: it requires relatively minimal energy use and we can get planetary data along the way. Buuuuut…” I traced the opposite direction, dragging my finger over Venus, then under the sun and up off the top edge of the poster.

“We have basically nothing from *above* the ecliptic,” I said. “The Voyagers tried to capture a picture of all the planets in our solar system, but we’ve never succeeded. We haven’t been able to get far enough, and they’ve never been aligned properly. So what if we shot a probe normal to the ecliptic, and took a picture of the entire solar system in one go? We could also, of course, gather data and such, but the picture might help the public feel more… y’know, unified and proud.”

Angela snickered and Kim frowned. Angela shook her head and smiled.

“Sarah, that would take an impractical amount of energy. Without multiple planets to boost off of, we’d be having to fight against the sun with no assistance. It’s not reasonable.” I grimaced and shook my head.

“We’ll be using the sun as a boost!”

“Yeah, but breaking out of the sun’s gravity once we’re boosting is just infeasible.”

“Not…” Kim said as he gestured towards the poster. “If we use the outer planets too. We can boost off of them multiple times, launch back towards the sun, and complete a gravitational assist there.” I grinned. He was considering it!

“Plus,” I said, compounding on his growing intrigue. “We’ve never done such a thing. Maybe it will give us more insight into the creation of the solar system, being able to see the entire solar system and get readings from above it.”

*Or maybe… we’ll hit a wall.*

I didn’t say that last part aloud, of course. No reason to get people questioning my sanity again. Kim seemed to be considering it closely, humming to himself in thought. After a couple moments, he sighed and nodded, prompting me to fist-pump.

“I’ll see what I can do,” he said. “But it’s out of my hands past a certain point. And as for you,” he pointed at me. “You’re on thin ice. Tread lightly.”

“Of course,” I said giddily. It was hardly guaranteed to work, but… it was a start. Wall… whatever you are… you better start panicking.

Y’know, bit of a hard pill to swallow.” I frowned. My theory had some holes, but… there were potential solutions. I couldn’t begin to speculate further without some solid evidence.

“Well,” I said with pursed lips. “It needn’t be a literal, physical wall. Maybe it’s a radiation belt,” I explained. “Or maybe it doesn’t cover everything. Maybe there are holes in it.” Devon hummed some more nodding.

“That could do it,” he said thoughtfully. I quietly contemplated the dilemma I faced. I could use an outside perspective…

“I could use your thoughts on something,” I said, rubbing my temples. All this thinking while hung over… not pleasant. “My protagonist is trying to convince some people about the whole wall thing… how should I write that?” Devon laughed, though he quieted down after I winced from the sharp noise.

“Well, your protag’s gonna have quite the uphill struggle. They’re gonna need some solid evidence.”

“Right,” I said in frustration. “But she can’t *get* more evidence without convincing people enough to get a probe launched… which… is basically impossible.” Devon shrugged.

“Well, NASA launches things all the time, right? I mean, they just did more Voyager probes like two years ago, right?” I winced at the reminder, hoping that Devon didn’t notice. If he did, he didn’t comment on it. “So, your protagonist could use false pretenses: come up with a different reason to get a probe where she wants one to be, a reason that’d be more acceptable to her superiors. Once she’s got the evidence she needs, she can leverage that.”

“Right,” I agreed. “But what kind of pretenses could convince NASA to expend the kind of resources necessary to prove such a thing? I would need to… I would need to *write* a convincing enough explanation that would-“ I suddenly jerked up, startling Devon.

“Jaysus, you all good there?” I grinned, pulling out my phone and opening the memo application.

“I got it.”



“Alright, Sarah: you mind telling me just what the *fuck* you did to get us in this much shit?”

I winced a little, pulling away from the chastising my boss was giving me. The rest of the weekend had been rather uneventful— I spent an inordinate amount of time just preparing for today— but no amount of preparation or planning could remove the sting from Kim’s glare. He always had a way of cutting right into your soul with just a look.

“Well,” I said with as much conviction as I could muster. “Director Braun wasn’t very fond of the Voyager program’s… ‘failure’… and nothing I could say would convince him to ease up on us. He’s starting to think maybe there was foul play in terms of allocation of funds. Embezzling or something, I dunno.” Kim’s eyes narrowed further, and he took a step closer to me.

“Right,” he said suspiciously. “And why am I hearing that their investigation is centering around you? What *exactly* did you say?” I pursed my lips. There was no getting around this. I needed to stand my ground, I needed to be confident. If I showed weakness, if I started to crumble, my plan would fail before it even began. Unfortunately, that almost certainly meant confrontation.

“You already know what I said,” I said simply. Kim bit his lower lip and held his head in his hands. Off to the right, I noticed Angela grin and rest her head in her right hand.

“C’mon Kim, lay off the poor girl. All the greatest discoveries sounded like insanity once upon a time. She might be the next Galileo, yeah?” There was a distinct tone of sarcasm to her voice, but I didn’t get the impression she was simply mocking me. Despite her less-than-enthused tone, I shot Angela a smile. Even if it was… shaky… any support at all was appreciated. She gave me a wink in response. “Besides, at least she gave Braun something to chew on. You think any explanation *you* could’ve given would have made him happy?”

“No,” Kim admitted. “But I wouldn’t have him thinking I’m insane!” Kim pinched the bridge of his nose and shook his head. “Why did he even want to speak with *you*, specifically? You’re just a data scientist, he should have been talking to the Voyager lead,” he said and gestured towards himself. I tapped my fingers against my leg nervously and chuckled.

“Well… that would be because I told him I had an explanation.” For a second, Kim looked like he was about to blow a gasket. After a moment, however, he sighed and chuckled.

“I mean… heh… you’re fired, of course.” I clenched my fist tightly as he shook his head. He muttered a bit to himself, though I couldn’t make out the words, then he looked back at me. “You threw the entire Voyager program under the bus… hell, I’ve got the Deep Space division climbing up my ass right now, even SMD is…” he shook his head.

“Wait. Before you fire me, there’s a much better way to use me,” I offered. I’d prepared for this eventuality… step one of my plan to expose the truth was to save myself. I couldn’t do anything if I was fired. “Director Braun is auditing the entire program, right? Maybe he’s even moving up the ladder and looking at division-wide examinations. We know we’re innocent, right? We’ll be cleared of suspicion soon enough. But in the meantime, if something else comes up… if Braun demands funding cuts… I can be your scapegoat.”

It wasn’t exactly an airtight defense, but it was what I had right now. As long as it kept me around a bit longer, I could make myself more valuable and leverage that for my continued employment.

“You get rid of me now,” I continued, “and you lose a bargaining chip when Braun comes knocking and demands action.” Kim wasn’t happy, but he did seem to be considering my proposal. Angela watched on, not even hiding the fact that she was enjoying this juicy conversation. That was just the kind of person she was. Kim hummed, his fingers on his chin, as he paced briefly and thought to himself.

“Besides, I have an idea for a propaganda win that could offset the sting of this defeat,” I concluded. That got Kim’s attention. He raised an eyebrow and looked at me, silently prompting me to go on. I gestured to a nearby poster we had hanging up of the solar system. I traced the path of Voyager out through the various planets beyond the asteroid belt. “We keep sending probes out this way to gather data, right? It makes sense: it requires relatively minimal energy use and we can get planetary data along the way. Buuuuut…” I traced the opposite direction, dragging my finger over Venus, then under the sun and up off the top edge of the poster.

“We have basically nothing from *above* the ecliptic,” I said. “The Voyagers tried to capture a picture of all the planets in our solar system, but we’ve never succeeded. We haven’t been able to get far enough, and they’ve never been aligned properly. So what if we shot a probe normal to the ecliptic, and took a picture of the entire solar system in one go? We could also, of course, gather data and such, but the picture might help the public feel more… y’know, unified and proud.”

Angela snickered and Kim frowned. Angela shook her head and smiled.

“Sarah, that would take an impractical amount of energy. Without multiple planets to boost off of, we’d be having to fight against the sun with no assistance. It’s not reasonable.” I grimaced and shook my head.

“We’ll be using the sun as a boost!”

“Yeah, but breaking out of the sun’s gravity once we’re boosting is just infeasible.”

“Not…” Kim said as he gestured towards the poster. “If we use the outer planets too. We can boost off of them multiple times, launch back towards the sun, and complete a gravitational assist there.” I grinned. He was considering it!

“Plus,” I said, compounding on his growing intrigue. “We’ve never done such a thing. Maybe it will give us more insight into the creation of the solar system, being able to see the entire solar system and get readings from above it.”

*Or maybe… we’ll hit a wall.*

I didn’t say that last part aloud, of course. No reason to get people questioning my sanity again. Kim seemed to be considering it closely, humming to himself in thought. After a couple moments, he sighed and nodded, prompting me to fist-pump.

“I’ll see what I can do,” he said. “But it’s out of my hands past a certain point. And as for you,” he pointed at me. “You’re on thin ice. Tread lightly.”

“Of course,” I said giddily. It was hardly guaranteed to work, but… it was a start. Wall… whatever you are… you better start panicking.

I like an Americano made from the bean. My wife likes a ""sort-of Cappuccino"". I say ""sort-of"" because it's not a true Cappuccino. With the Keurig, she heats the milk in the microwave and then froths it with an electric wisk. Then she puts her ground coffee into a k-cup. She likes a coconut blend ground coffee from Target. She brews 10 oz over the frothed milk.

The issue is, when she tries to mimic this as close as she can on the KF6, she gets a watered down drink. She's tried all the drinks in the machine that disperse milk. She's tried all different settings in each. 

One thing I notice is she never gets a ""puck"" in the disposal. Its always just wet grounds dumped. I don't know if that is a hint to the coffee not being compressed, if it should be compressed like the beans are when ground.

1i95lc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RhinoCatalyst/comments/1i95lc0/how_to_create_a_championship_life_three_winning/,How to Create a Championship Life: Three Winning Plays for the Fourth Quarter,"Football season is winding down, and it’s got me thinking about something powerful. In football, as in life, the champions are crowned in the fourth quarter. You can set the tone in the first three quarters but remember: you are the one who can make the difference in that final stretch.



Your role is crucial to your success.



Think about it. The first three-quarters of your life might be about building your career, raising your family, and achieving personal milestones. But when you hit that fourth quarter—when you’ve already accomplished so much—the question becomes: What does it mean to finish strong?



It might be wrapping up an important project at work, cultivating a loving relationship with your family, or reaching that personal goal you’ve been striving for. The fourth quarter is where legacy happens. It’s time to turn all your hard work, experience, and wisdom into something significant.

Here are three ways you can create a Championship Life in your fourth quarter:



1. Commit to a Purpose-Driven Life

The fourth quarter is not just about working harder—it’s about working smarter and with intention. Take time to reflect on what truly matters to you. What legacy do you want to leave behind? How can you align your daily actions with your core values? When you focus on purpose, you’ll find fulfillment in every moment.

Action Tip: Write down your “why.” Define your mission for this phase of your life and revisit it daily to stay focused.



2. Build and Strengthen Relationships

Champions don’t play solo—they have a team. Your relationships are your most significant assets. Build strong, meaningful connections with your family, friends, colleagues, or community. Relationships bring joy and support and amplify your impact on the world.

Action Tip: Schedule regular “team meetings” with those you care about. These could be family dinners, date nights, or coffee chats with a mentor or friend.



3. Push for Personal Growth

Even in the final quarter, champions don’t stop growing. The fourth quarter is the perfect time to double down on self-improvement. Learn something new, challenge yourself, and stay curious. Growth is the fuel for reinvention and keeps you engaged and energized.

Action Tip: Choose one new skill or habit to develop this quarter. Sign up for a class, start a fitness challenge, or read a book that stretches your perspective.



The fourth quarter is your time to shine, to make your mark, and to leave a legacy. It’s when all your hard work, experience, and wisdom come together to create something extraordinary.



If you’re ready to make your fourth quarter count—prepared to win your championship—let’s connect. 



Because in football and life, championships don’t happen in the early plays—they’re crowned in the final quarter.



Be Bold. Be Extraordinary. Be a Champion.

Are there other games you hardly get bored with after months?

-easy to carry around
-great for 2 person (can be for 2+, but should be enjoyable for 2)
-small enough game area to enjoy in different situations

So I was talking to a guy on hinge with who I had a great conversation. He asked me out but I couldn’t at the time but we still kept chatting and said that we’d love too when we’re both back because he was leaving too. Turns out by a huge coincidence he works at a radio station that I work in one day a week. I hadn’t  really heard from him during the break but I texted him when I was back and he said he was too.
I texted him again later saying I’d be working at the radio so that he wouldn’t be blindsided. He was like okay great so not much reaction by text. He then left me on read for the rest of our conversation. When I saw him for the first time it was a very close work setting and we were next to each other the entire time. We were both nervous I can tell and he seems shy but we still managed to talk. He finished later as he actually is an employee but I gained the confidence to ask him if he might want to get a coffee once he has finished and he seemed very happy too. He said he’d let me know when he was done. He never did so I went home. The next day I put a question about book recommendations in my story and he answered so I texted him asking about it. I said sorry if I made him uncomfortable and he said that he needed to apologize to me instead for not texting me but that we could do something on a weekend. I saw him at work today and everything was normal and chatty. At lunch we both went to a supermarket talked the whole way back and forth. Right as we were going back into the office I said that if he had changed his mind it was 100% okay if he wanted to forget about before but that I needed to know.

I’ve been having a frustrating issue with my Breville Barista Touch and I’m hoping someone here can help. I was away for about a month, and when I came back, I noticed the machine wasn’t brewing properly. Almost no espresso comes out of the portafilter—just a few drops, even when set to brew a double shot. However, if I remove the portafilter or the shower screen, water flow looks completely normal. 

I’ve now descaled the machine twice, run a cleaning cycle with the tablet, done multiple backflush cycles, and deep-cleaned the shower screen (which is spotless). I also cleaned the group head thoroughly, including wiping around the gasket and central water outlet. Despite all this, the machine still stalls for a while before any water comes out when brewing with coffee. The steam wand works perfectly, so I don’t think the pump is the issue.

The strange thing is that I haven’t changed anything about my setup. I’ve been grinding Counter Culture Big Trouble at size 15 on the built-in grinder and dosing 18g. I honestly don’t know if that’s the “correct” setup, but it’s always worked fine for me in the past, so I’m not sure why it’s suddenly an issue now.

At this point, I’m really not sure what to do. Has anyone experienced something similar? Could it be the solenoid valve, and if so, is it something I can fix myself? I’d really appreciate any advice.

Thanks so so much in advance!",2,1737750944.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False

Initially, I thought I was having heart issues at 36 despite being in decent shape at around 180 lbs. I went to the ER and had an EKG and blood panel with Troponin/electrolytes/thyroid etc, and of course, everything came back fine along with normal blood pressure. They diagnosed me with potential GERD and sent me on my way with some Pepcid. I followed it up with my primary where they did another two EKGs and tested negative for H.Pylori, and I was given a Holter monitor to wear for two weeks, and it came back mostly normal with only some extra beats. My doctor scheduled me a follow-up with a Cardiologist to go over the final results but told me he doesn't think the extra beats are anything significant.

  
I used to be a caffeine/coffee junkie. I quit the coffee altogether because the symptoms scared me, and limit my caffeine to a diet soda a day now. It doesn't seem to matter or make a difference what I eat, I still have a messed up stomach and constant gas pressure/acid, which I believe is causing the heart symptoms.

Up until I got diagnosed with gd. Ever since then it has just been one thing after the other. First it was failing the 1 hr. Then failing the 3 hour. Then learning I had to prick my finger 4x a day and change my entire lifestyle and walk 15 min after every meal. Then to being put on nighttime insulin and then to having to split my insulin so I have to give myself a shot twice now. And now today. I was so excited to get a Dexcom so I don’t have to prick my finger 4x a day now. Well this morning around 2 hours after eating breakfast I spike to 140. (I only have to record my 1 hour time) and it only last maybe 5 min and don’t think too much of it because I changed my routine and didn’t drink my coffee with my breakfast like I normally do because someone brought me coffee to work this morning. Well then I eat lunch. My 1 hour number is 104. Great. Now I’m at the 2 hour mark and I’ve spiked to 142. So I prick my finger to double check and sure enough the Dexcom is right. I stay that way for about 15 min before it goes below 140. Idk if it’s a fluke or if I’ve been spiking at the 2 hour mark this entire time. I got diagnosed at 25 weeks and I’m 29 today. My lunch was my leftover dinner of protein pasta. It didn’t spike me last night and the Dexcom didn’t say I was spiking at the 2 hour mark either. I did eat dark chocolate covered almonds and a thin cookie with my lunch (my husband scaled them out so it was 15g carbs) and had 2 cheese sticks with it for extra protein. Maybe this was why, but now I’m worried I’ve been spiking at the 2 hour mark this entire time and just didn’t know because I’ve been told to test only the 1 hr.

My coffee grinder might have also been running while the espresso maker was on.

Is there a way to split the rooms using that extra spot in the panel? Also, should I look into getting a bigger panel for if I ever want to get batteries or an electric vehicle?

**1.**     **Managing for Tinnitus (use in combination)** **(secondary points may be either clarification or examples)**

**Pathophysiology/Pathogenesis/Etiology of Tinnitus**

\-         Imbalance of hormones from kidney

o   Kidney hormones

§  Angiotensin II: produced by the RAAS that controls blood pressure

§  Renin: an enzyme that is part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Renin is released when blood pressure drops

\-         Tinnitus sounds are coming from the brain, not the ears

o   Hormones in the ear senses that there is an imbalance in pressure and sends a message to the brain

§  Brain sends back a phantom sound which is the tinnitus sound

o   Changes that result in higher activity in the brain than before?

**Things that may reduce Tinnitus**

\-         Magnesium (relaxes the nerves) (improves blood flows)

o   Almonds, or other kinds of nuts? (have magnesium)

\-         Vitamin C (helps with inflammation)

o   Pineapples

o   Blueberries

o   

\-         Vitamin B?

o   If low energy, does it affect tinnitus?

\-         Protein

o   Whey protein?

§  Speeds up heart rate, putting more compensatory workload on the heart, which may worsen tinnitus?

\-         Whole grains? (cleaner energy than refined grains)

o   Oatmeal

\-         Inflammatory agents

o   Honey

\-         Fiber

o   Chia seeds/flaxseed

\-         Adequate water intake

\-         Stimulants

o   Sudafed (relieves sinus pressure, including ear pressure?)

§  Can worsen if hypertensive, comp. workload on heart, worsen tinnitus?

§  Hold off if onset of tinnitus is greater than before going off dose (do not use consecutively more than 7 days)

o   Claritin is questionable (may make tinnitus worse)

o   Adderall

o   Coffee

\-         Stress relievers

o   Deep breathing exercises

o   Meditation   

o   Walks (stress relievers)

§  Protect ears during walks, such as winter fur-hat, fleece cloth for neck, scarf, balaclava

·        Preferable to cover mouth and nose with moisture wicking material (to filter cold air to warm air)

o   Delays or stops immune system from sending signals to moisture the nose which causes a runny nose

\-         Humidity in range (generally 30-50%, what about 40-60%?)

\-         Color noise at night (white noise, green noise) (helps to deenergize the brain)

o   May worsen tinnitus if decibel sounds are over 40?

§  Use iphone app to show how many db. that the sound of the color is displaying

\-         Herbal supplements (get tested first before trying, may already be adequate or have an overload)

o   Ginkgo bilboa

**Things that may worsen Tinnitus**

o   Moderate to heavy aerobic exercises (exacerbates heart rate and blood pressure, especially for those hypertensive)

§  Jump ropes

\-         Sinusitis

o   Blowing nose with tissue, may cause feelings of uneven pressure in ears

o   Can cause unilateral tinnitus to bilateral tinnitus (online opinion: serious), check for ENT or audiologist for possible hearing loss (hz)

o   Can come from COVID? HMPV?

\-         Low humidity, under 30% in a home

o   More likely to catch virus/bacterial infections

\-         Dehydration

\-         Loud noises (as well as prolonged periods of moderate db. Over 40?

o   Environmental conditions like work

o   Concerts/stadiums/karaoke

o   Headphones/earbuds

\-         Cold temperatures

\-         Ear infection (inner or middle ear)

\-         Stress (hormonal changes that speed things up in the body)

o   Higher heart rate, blood pressure

\-         Chemicals or bacteria?

o   Dust?

o   Chemicals from tap water?

§  Chlorine?

\-         Chronic conditions

o   Hypertension (overloads blood vessels in ears)

o   TMJ (connected to the ear)

§  Popping of the jaw every time mouth is opened

o   CAD/PAD?

o   T2DM?

It does a lot to a person to hear death is getting closer. My father was definitely not finished with his life, his work, his legacy. And my mother, did everything she could to follow the doctor's advice. Even though I secretly slipped in those yolks from time to time, guilty and full of shame. 

I could imagine my father getting tested more often and more often. Bringing him to the hospital at age 58. Waiting for the inevitable. He never smoked a cigarrette, nor did he drink more than 10 glasses of alcohol in his entire life. The only time he tried alcohol was by himself, documenting everything he felt. It was not for him.

He was quite active, track athletics and shot-put in particular were a favorite past-time. It was quite surprising that he was still on the course to heart attack, despite doing everything right. That's where the confusion started. Is it genetic? Is it cholesterol? Can I even do anything? Or is it up to the gods?

**Risk-Factors**  
As I moved out of my childhood home, I was promised ""the time of my life."" I felt at home at the philosophy faculty. A place where alcohol was abundant. The existential starter pack, a coffee and a cigarette became relatively standard. 

In hindsight I ticked all the boxes. Smoking, alcohol, sedentary lifestyle, it was only waiting for the other risk-factors for heart disease like high blood pressure or high cholesterol. 

I still had the time of my life, but if it was good for my health? Well clearly not. My interest in health was limited to the odd blog online, declaring if alcohol is healthy or not. I would drink the wine anyway. 

**Scientific developments**  
Somehow I always expected that science would find a cure for heart disease if it was my time. But even now, 30 years after my grandparents died, there are no big changes in our thinking about heart disease. The only difference for me, was that two years ago, I gained some weird algorithm to ask avery single question on the matter. Could chatGPT lead me closer to find actionable insights towards heart disease? Could AI make me live to 80?

Two years and countless studies and books later it seems that identifying a root cause is a love for wisdom. Something I am actually quite qualified to do. My desire to find the root causes of disease have sent me on a quest. And I will take you with me on that quest, here in r/supplements. 

My main aim by identifying root-causes, is to cut through the noise. All the health bloggers and instagram gurus who prioritize posting volume over careful analysis. The AI generated posts repeating the same old software, programmed into our GPT models. It's a headache, but it is exactly the headache a philosopher likes to examine. 

**Logic**  
Humanity is quite inventive. It took only 8 years from the discovery of nuclear fission to develop the atomic bomb. If there is priority to solve a problem it will be done, and it will be done fast. Think about how fast we got those vaccines after the outbreak of corona. 

At the same time we are still using the same strategies in our battle against cardiovascular disease. Which means it is high time for our current endeavour. To carefully examine the root cause of heart disease. 

The aim for our analysis in regard to r/supplements is to save a lot of money. Knowing what truly causes cardiovascular disease will give us actionable insights. Those insights can be used the next time when you are shopping for supplements, or when deciding on a long-term health strategy. 

So, I would like to ask you, just like I shared my story. What do you believe, or what did you believe to be the root cause of heart disease. I will use your reactions in the next parts. ",0,1737749939.0,Supplements,1,0.33,False

Hi friends,

I work from home in tech sales and it gets lonely. 

Wondering if any ladies working in a similar field want to meet up at a coffee shop or even rent a board room at co-working spaces? We can chat, rant, share stories and also get some work done not from home in sweatpants. 

I live by Yonge and Sheppard but willing to travel midtown or downtown. 

Let me know if any of you’d be up for this once a month, of if it’s doable once a week.

Why just ladies?
Bc it’s a male dominated industry and I don’t wanna hear about how you’re making 30% more than me doing the same job bc you’re in boys club. #facts",68,1737749719.0,askTO,60,0.76,False

I ordered a bunch of small purse sprays from demeter fragrance library plus a couple of other items. From left to right in the photo we have: champagne brut roll on (free gift not one I picked), tomato, black tea, Baihao yinzen, earthworm, saffron, thunderstorm, mushroom, black pepper, paperback, gingerale, fireplace, clove, and fresh brewed coffee lotion. 

I haven't tried everything on my skin yet and the last 3 items are for my brother, though he did give me permission to test them out. I have sniffed and sprayed them all on paper, but I'm wondering if a few of them need to settle a bit after shipping. 

Scents that smell exactly like they claim to: tomato, gingerale, mushroom, fresh brewed coffee. These three are all insane. Tomato I was most excited for. There is a reason I bought a bigger bottle and it does not disappoint. It smells just like my garden in the summer full of tomato plants and makes me feel like the sun is shining on me. So good! Gingerale smells like I opened a can of canada dry, though it dries down on my skin with a bit more vanilla in it. Mushroom is so exact! I'm shocked and excited to layer it with other things. The coffee is for my brother, but I tried a bit in my hands and it really is like a cup of coffee.

The tea scents as well as all the spice ones were a bit disappointing. I wonder if they need to settle after traveling. The black pepper especially I was excited about for layering. I have perfumes with black pepper notes that smell like fresh cracked peppercorns. This black pepper scent does smell peppery, but more like the crappy, stale, preground pepper. 

Things that smell good, but not like what they claim to be: earthworm, champagne brut, fireplace, thunderstorm. The champagne brut is giving white grape juice and something zesty. I guess in a way thats like champagne, but also not really. It smells insanely good layered with gingerale. That's what I'm wearing right now and it's making my mouth water. Earthworm, fireplace and thunderstorm all smell nice, but not exact. I wonder if they will smell different after resting a bit. 

I got all of these with the intent of layering over other perfumes. I haven't done that yet though, so I can't comment on their performance. I'm excited to add more atmospheric or spicy notes to some of my greener or fruited perfumes though!",3,1737749553.0,fragrance,0,0.71,False
