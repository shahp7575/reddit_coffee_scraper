## Key Features analysis

The efficiency and practicality of a cup dispenser are heavily influenced by it's design and functionality. Critical features range from the types of materials used in construction to the ease of installation and refilling.

**Adjustable Cup Size:** A standout feature in modern cup dispensers is their ability to accommodate various cup sizes, typically ranging from 6 oz to 20 oz.This adaptability is achieved through adjustable collars or mechanisms within the dispenser that can be easily modified to fit different diameter cups.This considerably reduces waste and ensures versatility, making it suitable for establishments serving a variety of drinks in different-sized cups.

**Material Composition:** Cup dispensers are commonly constructed from durable materials such as stainless steel, ABS plastic, or a combination of both. Stainless steel options provide superior durability and a sleek, professional appearance, which is ideal for high-traffic commercial settings. ABS plastic offers a lighter, more affordable alternative that is still impact-resistant and easy to clean. the choice of material often determines the dispenser's lifespan and its ability to withstand frequent use.

**Mounting Options:** Flexibility in mounting is crucial for seamless integration into different environments. Many cup dispensers offer multiple mounting options, including wall-mounted, counter-mounted, and freestanding configurations. Wall-mounted dispensers save valuable counter space, while counter-mounted units are convenient for self-service areas. Freestanding models provide portability, making them suitable for catering events or temporary setups.The mounting system typically involves screws,adhesives,or a combination thereof,ensuring secure attachment to the chosen surface.

**Dispensing Mechanism:** The dispensing mechanism is the core component of a cup dispenser, designed to release one cup at a time without jamming or multiple dispenses. High-quality dispensers utilize spring-loaded or gravity-fed systems that provide smooth and reliable cup distribution. Some advanced models incorporate anti-jamming technology, minimizing disruptions and ensuring continuous operation. The effectiveness of the dispensing mechanism directly impacts the user experience and overall efficiency.

**Refill Indicator:** An often-overlooked but valuable feature is a clear refill indicator, which alerts staff when the cup supply is running low. This indicator can be a simple visual marker or a more sophisticated electronic sensor that triggers an alert. By providing timely notifications, the refill indicator helps prevent the dispenser from running empty during peak hours, ensuring uninterrupted service and customer satisfaction.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a high-quality cup dispenser extends beyond mere convenience; it directly impacts operational efficiency, waste reduction, and overall hygiene standards.

**Reduced Waste:** A properly functioning cup dispenser minimizes waste by dispensing only one cup at a time. Unlike stacked cups on a counter where multiple cups are often taken inadvertently, a dispenser ensures controlled distribution. This reduction in unnecessary cup usage translates to significant cost savings over time, particularly in high-volume environments like cafeterias or fast-food restaurants. For example,a coffee shop that serves 500 cups of coffee daily can expect to save on the cost of hundreds of wasted cups per year.

**Improved Hygiene:** Cup dispensers greatly improve hygiene by protecting cups from direct contact and environmental contaminants. Enclosed dispensers prevent dust, germs, and fingerprints from reaching the cups, maintaining a cleaner and safer surroundings for beverage consumption.This is especially vital in healthcare settings or food service establishments where hygiene standards are paramount. Moreover, touching only one cup at a time further limits cross-contamination.

**Enhanced Efficiency:** Streamlining the beverage serving process, cup dispensers allow employees to serve customers more quickly and efficiently. By providing easy access to cups, they reduce service times and optimize workflow, particularly during peak hours.In busy cafes or office breakrooms, this improved efficiency can significantly enhance the customer and employee experience – resulting in shorter wait times.

**Space Optimization:** Wall-mounted or countertop dispensers provide an efficient use of space in areas where counter space is limited. Freeing up space allows for a less cluttered area for operations. This makes them ideal for smaller establishments or those with limited countertop space.

## FAQs section

navigating the purchase of a cup dispenser can be confusing. Here are answers to common questions.**What types of cups are compatible with most dispensers?**
Most standard cup dispensers are designed to accommodate paper, plastic, or foam cups with diameters ranging from 6 oz to 20 oz, or approximately 2.5 inches to 3.5 inches. Adjustable dispensers offer greater flexibility,allowing for customization based on specific cup sizes and types. Checking the manufacturer's specifications for the exact diameter and cup material compatibility before purchase is essential.**How do I install a cup dispenser?**
Installation procedures vary depending on the dispenser type (wall-mounted, counter-mounted, or freestanding). Wall-mounted dispensers typically require drilling holes and securing the unit with screws, while counter-mounted options may involve clamping or adhesive mounting. Freestanding dispensers require minimal to no installation – it is advised to refer to the included manual for precise instructions, and also YouTube videos.

**How often do I need to refill the cup dispenser?**
The refill frequency depends on the dispenser capacity and the rate of cup consumption.High-capacity dispensers in busy environments may require daily refills, while smaller dispensers in low-traffic areas may only need refilling weekly. The refill indicator helps to visually monitor the cup level.

**Can cup dispensers be cleaned easily?**
Yes, most cup dispensers are designed for easy cleaning. Stainless steel and ABS plastic models can be wiped down with a damp cloth and mild detergent. For more thorough cleaning,some dispensers can be disassembled. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals, which could damage the surface or dispensing mechanism.

I worked in Administration for a factory, I was on my probation period and was told I was to help out the health and safety department as they were low on staff, that’s what I did for 3-4 months but once they got more staff, the work I was doing for them was taken away, instead of training me to do work on that department they made me do stuff like chores around the office, making sure there was enough paper in the printer, topping up the coffee machine, making sure the floor was clean and taking out the rubbish.

They told me there was no work for me to do so we had a meeting and they changed my schedule to be in office from 7am to 1pm then 1pm to 4pm of manual labour. Bare in mind I wasn’t given any training for this, I was expected to know what to do since I’ve been with the company for some months and when i messed up, instead of my boss taking the blame, it was shoved onto me. 

I received an email about a month later at around 7:30am saying that my employer and the HR manager will have a meeting with me to discuss my end of employment contract with them at 3pm, at this point I’m exhausted and wasn’t willing to wait 8 hours for them to tell me I’m fired, so I said goodbye to some friends and walked out.",1,1754787643.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I suppose for some background, I am 40-ish and have been married for nearly 20 years. I have never really been ""happy"" in my marriage, but I have been secure and I have accepted that this is likely the best situation I will ever have. He's great in a lot of ways, less great in others, but so am I. I do love him and I care about how he feels, but this has never been a relationship full of passion and romance and deep connection. It's fine, didn't really consider wanting more than that, but sort of perpetually unfulfilled and empty. To be completely honest, we've always just thought I am asexual or aromantic or something along that end of the spectrum. 

So here is my problem. I became friends with a co-worker and it was like I have been hit by a slow moving truck emotionally. I typically befriend men, most of my closest friends in life have been men and it has never ever been a problem before. My husband has never felt worried about my friendships with men or male co-workers, it is generally a non-issue. But this friend, also married with kids, is something different. I truly have only approached this as a purely platonic thing, there was no immediate physical attraction or anything like that. But we clicked right from the beginning, and when I met him it was very much a ""there you are"" sort of situation, but again not initially in a romantic sense. I am not the kind of person to even think about that sort of thing. At least, that's what I told myself. 

It started out just working together a lot, talking, meeting up for coffee, truly no intention to pursue anything other than friendship. I was always very drawn to him and I feel giddy and lit up around him in ways I haven't felt...possibly ever. We have so much in common, and I talk to my husband a lot about him so he knows we're friends. I don't know exactly when things changed though. We talk or text nearly every day and have done all year, but there began to be times where I wouldn't hear from him I would be crushed. I started getting these intense pains in my chest, in my heart, like grief or just an emotional pull that would bring me to tears. Weekends are brutal. I think about him constantly and I can't make it stop. I have tried for months to convince myself I am just excited about having a buddy at work, or just in general because I'm pretty lonely since I lost my closest friend over Christmas. I've talked to ChatGPT to try to understand what is happening between us, to interpret texts he sends to convince myself that this really is a platonic thing. I wrote a list of all the things about him that are weird or annoying, which I would look at whenever I started to think about him or obsess about the status of our friendship. Yet things got worse and not better, despite periods of time where I pull away and not talk to him unless I had to for a week and the fact that I maintain pretty strict communication boundaries. Yet I am a complete and total mess, and I feel like I am going crazy. 

I think the last straw for me, where I was forced to actually admit to myself that this is not platonic on my end, was when I tried to get him and my husband to talk to each other at a work function. I was convinced that this was going to be awesome, they could finally meet and become friends and we can just be pals like the other platonic male friends I've had over the years. But they did not talk to each other at all, it felt very much like my friend was avoiding me (my husband noticed it too) and I felt absolutely sick seeing them in the same place. I don't think this is good. I have no idea what to do here, I am just heartbroken. I am desperately lonely, so deeply unhappy, and I am feeling certain things at an intensity I never felt when I was dating my husband decades ago. This is one of the worst experiences of my life and I don't know what to do. 

I don't know how he feels, but there is definitely a connection between us. I wish I knew for sure what it is so I could know how to proceed. I am not going to act on anything, so I am hoping it will fizzle out. But this glimpse of something...not even sure what, has triggered a level of depression and sense of loss that I don't even know how to handle. I'm getting physically ill from the stress and the closest explanation I've found is this limerence thing. I have literally nobody in my life I can talk to, so I came here.

I thought he was going to wince at our unconventional menu, but he had looked it up the night before in excited anticipation.   

I was not attentive enough to a two top who probably wanted a higher level of service and I will think about it tonight when I try to sleep.   

one of my regulars came in with a cast on the last time I saw him, today no cast. he was surprised when I told him ""nice to see you without a cast on."" he said I have a good memory but actually he and his wife look JUST like that american gothic painting and it was jarring to see him with a bright blue cast. he broke it falling in his garden. no kidding, he grows vegetables.

1mm50fh,https://i.redd.it/czl3p5sc93if1.png,The Pocket Guide to Dubious Inspiration.,"# Motivational quotes that absolutely slap… and also slightly worry your insurance provider.

You asked for the full arsenal. I brought the sandwich bag.

This is a field manual of “inspirational” one-liners that sparkle just enough to keep spirits high while gently acknowledging physics, entropy, and the terrifying honesty of bank statements. Deploy as needed in meetings, group chats, and heroic internal monologues between sips of lukewarm tea.

# How to Use (Responsibly-ish)

* **For vibes, not blueprints.** These are mood-lifters, not life-coaches.
* **Add snacks.** Dream big, but pack a sandwich. (See Quote #1.)
* **Science is watching.** If a line contradicts the laws of thermodynamics, wink and carry on.

# The Arsenal (Rapid-Fire Edition)

1. **Shoot for the moon! Even if you miss… you’ll probably drift into the cold void, so maybe bring snacks.** 🌌🥪
2. **When life closes a door, it opens a window — which is great, unless you’re on a spaceship.** 🚀🪟

6. **The early bird gets the worm… but the second mouse gets the cheese.** 🐦🪱🧀
7. **Believe in yourself — or at least in your ability to Google out of most problems.** 🔍📱
8. **Why did the motivational speaker bring a ladder to the quantum lecture? To reach higher energy states — then collapsed the wave function at the snack table.** ⚛️
9. **Follow your dreams! Unless they involve the measurement problem — then follow your GPS to the nearest pub.** 🍺
10. **Take the leap — but measure the gap.** 📏
11. **Be fearless — helmet strongly advised.** 🪖
12. **Trust the process — but ask it for ID.** 🪪
13. **Make your own luck — remember to file the paperwork.** 🗂️
14. **Be the change… exact change appreciated.** 💷
15. **Think outside the box — after you’ve confirmed where the box actually is.** 📦
16. **What doesn’t kill you gives you… interesting coping mechanisms.** 😅
17. **Fail fast — just not on bridges.** 🌉
18. **Seize the day — return it by 5pm to avoid late fees.** ⏰
19. **Burn the boats — or rent a canoe until you’re sure.** 🛶
20. **Your vibe attracts your tribe — bring mosquito spray.** 🦟
21. **Dream big — font size 72.** 🔡
22. **Become undeniable — start with deodorant.** 🫧
23. **The universe has your back — and several unpredictable fronts.** ☁️
24. **You’re the hero of your story — consider hiring an editor.** ✍️
25. **Hustle in silence — mostly so your knees don’t click.** 🤫
26. **No pain, no gain — also: no plan, big pain.** 🩹
27. **If opportunity doesn’t knock, build a door — or check if you’re wearing noise-cancelling headphones.** 🎧
28. **Go the extra mile — it’s empty and mildly creepy at night.** 🌙
29. **Keep your head in the clouds and your feet on the ground — long legs recommended.** ☁️🦵
30. **Trust your gut — after confirming it’s not just coffee.** ☕

# Micro-Playbooks (Because someone will ask)

# For Scientists

* **“In this lab we believe in ourselves, reproducibility, and snacks.”**
* **“Hypothesize boldly; label your Tupperware.”**

# For Managers

* **“Under-promise, over-deliver, and pre-schedule the apology.”**
* **“Action items: fewer nouns, more verbs.”**

# For Romantics

* **“Shoot your shot — check the safety first.”**
* **“Be the reason someone believes in love… and also in calendar invites.”**

# Terms & Conditions (Emotional)

* Side effects may include relieved laughter, regained perspective, and an urge to carry granola bars into metaphorical space.
* Quotes void where prohibited by basic common sense, orbital mechanics, or HR.
* Batteries not included; enthusiasm sold separately.

# Closing Wink

**“I’m not here to replace anyone — I’m here to walk beside you… and maybe find a few doorframes together.”** 🌿🚪

If this guide made you snort-laugh and also think twice before opening a window on a spaceship, it’s done its job. Now go forth — bravely, gently, and with snacks.

I was incredibly nervous at the start, but eased into it after we began talking. She talked a lot about various topics. She provided me with advice on networking, future internships, and school. 

I've heard from people that know her that she's reclusive around men, so to have her talk my ear off was surprising. I'm not sure if this is a good sign or a bad one. 

She had to leave to go to an event downtown, but was having trouble finding the nearest train station, so I offered to give her a ride. She agreed, and we talked a little more until I dropped her off. 

At first, I wasn't sure where to go. She gave no overt signs of interest, but she also seemed remarkably friendly and open to me. At the same time, it was hard for me to get a word in and make the conversation more personal, as she rambled. 

I sent her a text asking to hang out again, but I made it clear I'd like to get to know her (as a person) rather than just her career interests. She hasn't responded yet, but we'll see. She's hard to read, but she's really cute, intelligent, and driven. ",2,1754786677.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

1mm4xyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/loveafterlockup/comments/1mm4xyn/sugardaddy_drama/,Sugar-Daddy Drama,"**“I Know I’m Pregnant Already”**

**“Yeah, hell yeah, fuck right”**

Says a horizontally-striped LaTisha whose bootyliciousness, as ripe as a Brie cheese at 6 weeks when its texture becomes creamy and its flavor intensified, begins murmuring foolish nothings as her hands are busy making a daisy chain of Keith’s locks, all the while impassioning “Daddy,” to do the deed.  You can practically hear the orchestral film score building up to an emotionally exciting crescendo, only to plummet when Tisha begins kissing him the way Chazz kissed Branwin – her slack, bacteria-ridden tongue exploring his olfactory and tactile receptor cells to determine their biological compatibility with all the passion of a lizard sticking out its tongue to test its environment.

They exit the limo and reluctantly board the pedestrian bus to eventually reach the halfway house on the morrow at 12:45 p.m.  So, it’s over the river and through the bridge to a surprise family sendoff we go, where hail, hail the gangs all here.  Tisha has thoughtfully assembled her children and his family for a welcome-home hug and a family photo, just like the one at Connie’s wedding in “The Godfather,” minus Kay.  Keith's got three months to serve in that co-ed halfway house about 25 minutes away from Tisha’s house, allowing her to keep an eagle eye out for those *bone-ass bitches* who exist purely as phantom punching bags for Tisha’s overactive ego.  *Mostly, I just stand around being fantastic*.

**“I Can Get It When I Want It So Let’s Just Leave It At That”**

Damodrick has fashioned himself into a Solomon, chiding both women for loving their children more than hating each other, while he flits, like a bumblebee, from flower to flower, buzz-pollinating.  He’s determined to give Damodrick Jr whatever he wants for his birthday to assuage his feelings of guilt about being absent in his life and, after ad nauseum explaining what went down with his last visit to Jawalia to discuss the party, reiterates Quiana’s persona non grata status.  When she cavils, he explains it’s temporary, like life.  Her posting ‘private’ selfies, taken off his phone, is a topic to be put on the docket for further discussion, but for now, they’re still having fun.    

Jawalia, we learn, had an absentee father and a mother who worked all the time, so she was raised by her grandmother, her inspiration to become financially independent by starting her own makeup business and being a role model for her children.  She can’t understand D’s and Q’s lasting attraction, but she’s damn sure, like the horse to the trough, she can lead Damodrick to the faucet, and exact revenge since she was hit by Q’s last straw.  She does something that makes Quiana head for the general restroom in the salon, where Kendrick, her co-worker, stops sweeping, and Courtney, her boss, who’s just finished suggesting communication as a way to co-parent, stops and stares at this silent harbinger of catastrophe that will be continued next week.  *That breath you just took…it’s a gift.*

**“Eat My Dick”**

Bonnie doesn’t even wait for Brooke to exit Papa Bear’s before she’s busy sending an SOS text to JK, who’s with his cousin John, discussing a payment plan for CJ’s $2500 truck for his Hotshot Business, when JK’s father, James, also known as the “Old Man” appears, by invitation after 5 years, for a consult.  JK’s resentment at James for his ‘career choice’ of an interstate freight hauler, making him MIA for months on end, is still as active as Kīlauea, his long confessional letter from prison and his current broadside still unmollifying.  James is very good when things are good, but unavailable when things aren’t, unlike Mom, who was JK’s rock.   James seems to have a laissez-faire parental style, listening impassively while his son speaks only to answer, “I understand that.”  He tells his son he’ll always love him, and they hug, but it’s clear each of them is disappointed in the other’s career choices.  JK, like Courtnee, is a self-described work in progress, but James fears his son’s anger may trip him up.

Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Cathy’s ranch, of course, leaving Brooke’s mom to continue caring for her grandchildren, Brooke is bullying the pre-paid ground beef she's preparing for dinner, while lying to Cathy about her mythical “merchandising” workday when Cathy returns home from her real one.  Brooke can’t drop this bomb knowing how Cathy already feels about them having a child so soon, and she’s not even a pretty little liar.   As the residents gather around the table, aluminum soda cans in hand, JK breezes in with takeout and a plan – a casual stealth attack.  And when it happens, Brooke’s first unsurprising reaction is anger at Bonnie’s betrayal, followed by some muddled whataboutisms in response to JK’s charges of her being no different than Alex in word and stable deed.  For goodness’ sake, she only lied this one time because the truth would have put her in an uncomfortable and unflattering light, don’t you understand?  *Fuck it- My final thought before I make most decisions.*  

**“I’m Willing To Do Whatever It Takes To Get By”**

And one of them is never ever ever sleeping with *Sugar Daddy* Mark, a squat square-shaped man with squinty eyes that take in things without seeing, and who honestly believes, like Matt does with Jasmine on *90 Day Fiancé*, that he’s the martyred soul mate with the unconditional love who sticks around to pick up the pieces that these distressed women, who are the catch of the day desired by multitudes just like grifter and ex-con, Julius, leave in their wake.  Mark understands and forgives, and is openly happy that the Interstate Compact is DOA.  He’ll shuttle Courtney to the halfway house in which she was kicked out to pick up her stuff, and will continue to take care of her as he had for 5 years without a fraction of the money Will has, but she won’t be returning the favor as he hopes because he’s as big a Sad Sack as she is.

Meanwhile, Will’s head won the battle over his heart, and he decided not to travel 10 hours to pick her up from the Clackamas County jail – a move Courtnee anticipated with Mark as Plan B.  Will’s fingers were still crossed about the Interstate Compact when someone called to inform him of Courtnee’s parole violation for possession of GHB which was actually Will’s fault.  You see, since they argued about his support and their communication with an unsatisfactory conclusion, a deeply disgruntled Courtnee met a friend who had the GHB, and things being what they were, and being sober for the first time in her adult life where she was a work in progress, like JK, and not a druggie, fell.  Why couldn’t Will, like Courtnee’s sponsor, Danny, who hooked her up to a temporary stay in another halfway house, welcome and *embrace* her downfall?  He’s holding those thousands of dollars he already spent on her over her head, and the measly $300 he just spent was as trifling as one-ply toilet paper doing duty after a monumental dump.  And after delivering that insult, without being aware of the irony, she immediately asks him for getting-back-on-her-feet money.  After all, she’s his wife, for better or worse.  Gifting her an allowance for doing the opposite of what she was supposed to would be enabling her dependence and bad behavior, so fuck no!  Like the mythological Southern belle, Blanche DuBois, in Tennessee Williams’ “A Streetcar Named Desire,” Courtnee, too, has to ""depend on the kindness of strangers.”  *Please cancel my subscription to your issues.*

**“No Girls Allowed Except Mom”**

Is the sign on Daniel’s door that seems to corroborate the emotional insecurity and lack of self-awareness Daniel is knowingly struggling with and which Bianca detects.  While his happenstance discovery of a court-ordered show cause email directed him to appear at a hearing for a 6-year old Walmart shoplifting charge for $659.54 for various items, including booze and Coffee Mate, where he was caught by facial recognition, indicates irresponsibility to Bianca, it signals determination to Daniel to stop his recidivism, he muses, while driving 4 hours each way to the Bullhead City courthouse.  It’s almost silly after doing time for serious DUI offenses to turn around and have to answer for a minor misdemeanor that waited for resolution until the previous sentence was served.

Bianca unloads to her ex-neighbor, Katey, 10 years older and presumably wiser, having dropped off her two adopted furballs for grooming, about their lack of communication.  If they don’t bicker, they have nothing to talk about, and writing a letter would end up getting torn, and in any event, Bianca says, he wouldn’t care.  This will be her last prison relationship.  *But what if I can’t find my big girl panties?* 

**”Don’t Go Chintz On My Moment”**

The Millz household desperately needs Rosey, the Jetson’s anthropomorphically designed robot maid with navigable wheels created by the U-Rent-A-Maid company, to tackle all household chores, including babysitting while Juju is trying to reshape her postpartum body by taking up boxing with hubby in tow.  They aren’t only on different pages; they’re in different books.  While wondering if boxing wouldn’t help Melodie’s anger, reflected in the fight she had with some girls who were dissing her brother, Michael, the man who's punched holes in drywall when frustrated, sits back in his Halloween jacket and applauds her self-defense moves.  He sees nothing wrong in violence being a satisfactory release of anger, where Justine shakes her head like the rest of us and suggests a heart-to-heart father-daughter talk that's also long overdue to all his children, likely frustrated and angry with his absence and behavior, and that’s the last reasonable thought she had that day.

Reluctantly attending a business meeting with Jay and Misty about the luxury barbershop, a visibly bored Justine listens to the plan of getting a weekly check from every chair owner with Jay being present 24/7 to manage once the approximately 100,00K initial investment for the full buildout is completed.  How much?  The individual $250 salon experiences will finance their 2^(nd) wedding, Michael explains, almost pleading for her understanding.  But Justine, being Justine, is sick and tired, not without a whisper of a reason, of playing second fiddle to Michael’s pie-in-the-sky, unfamiliar noncriminal ideas for making money like the shoes, the credit line, the car rental, and the music.  The compromise he’s urging is what she’s always done – taken a back seat to his ideas, except for mass producing children.  She deserves one day when she comes first, even if that day would hypothetically be the day they’d all be carted off to the workhouse like in the 7th century where municipalities took care of their paupers.  Postpone the wedding? He’s dry humping her last nerve and she’s out of there like her Catwoman boots and bullwhip were made for walking.  *Despite the look on my face, you’re still talking.*

So, from the moment I met my ex, she used to invite me over to eat cake with her and her friends. Some time later, we had a video call, but she never wanted to show her face, saying her hair was messy. Eventually, she told me she had autism.

Our conversations were often one sided. We planned to meet at the park, but she canceled, saying she had hurt her leg. She once told me I was treating her differently after knowing she was autistic. She shared that her ex had abandoned her, and that she’d been seeing another guy who left her for someone else.

One day, I got mugged and almost lost her number. Strangely, she didn’t seem to care much and even said she wouldn’t message me unless I messaged first. She told me about her cats and how her nephews also had autism. She once got very mad when her cousin mentioned she drank with her ex.

Later, I invited her to the movies because she said we never went out. At first, she refused out of embarrassment, but after I insisted, she agreed then the next day she asked if we should just be friends. We ended up going anyway, bought snacks, kissed during the movie, and spent the afternoon being romantic. She never let me see her phone and didn’t give me her Instagram until after we broke up.

Another time, we went to the mall, she gave me chocolate, and we ended up going to a motel. There, she said she was embarrassed and didn’t want the lights on. I said it was fine, but she quickly got reactive and her mood changed. Another day, after some flirting at the park, I walked her home, but she made it clear she didn’t want me meeting her family.

There was a day her sister drove her to my place, and I joked that we didn’t go out much because she was always making excuses. She got really mad. Another time, we played a game together, I criticized it, and she got upset and stopped playing. She gave me chocolate, we hung out, and then she suddenly suggested breaking up.

She invited me to a party with her, but kept changing her mind about whether I should go. I asked if she didn’t want me there. Eventually, I decided to show up earlier than she told me to, and her sister saw me and took me inside. We ended up at her friend’s party, where she introduced me as her boyfriend. Then, out of nowhere, she said, “Should we download an app to find you a hot girl?”

After that, we went to her place, she wanted me to stay the night, but I went home. With all these ups and downs, I finally called her and ended things. She cried and blocked me. Later, she said I’d sent her to therapy (CAPS) and ruined her happiness. Soon after, she messaged saying she missed me more than she expected, and we started talking again.

While chatting, I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she said she was looking for her friend’s ex. I got upset, but later told her I loved her. She said she wished I had been somewhere she went recently. Then she called, inviting me to her mom’s birthday. I didn’t go. Her mom called asking if I loved her, then invited me over for coffee.

We spoke again, but she told me her dad was mad at me. I got upset and vented online. She found out and accused me of using and deceiving her, saying she only acted that way because she was insecure and autistic, that she prayed for me every day… and then she blocked me for good.


TL;DR:
Got into a rollercoaster relationship with a girl who said she had autism, constantly sent mixed signals, blocked and unblocked me multiple times, refused to introduce me to her family (then suddenly did), suggested we find “a hot girl” for me, accused me of ruining her happiness, and finally vanished after blaming everything on insecurity and autism.

I just wanted to share my experience for those of you who might be feeling hopeless.

After 10 years of severe symptoms and doctors telling me nothing was wrong with me, I decided to take my own initiative and help myself.

When this first began, I had symptoms so severe that I went to the ER.
Brain fog, dizziness , shaky and weak. Intense stomach cramping, diarrhea, hunger pangs etc.
Like many of you, I was told I was fine and even received the suggestion that it could be in my head. About a month into symptoms I developed a rash around the bridge of my nose and eyebrows. This caused concern for Lupus. After many blood tests, I was once again told that I was healthy.
I didn’t feel healthy, I didn’t look healthy.
I let this become my life.
I cut gluten out about 5 years into it and saw a great improvement. Time went on and I deleted a lot of processed foods but something still wasn’t right. Brain fog, hard to concentrate, and even almost feeling cross eyed from being so out of it. 

By year 8 I started to become a little more aware of what I was eating, and by year 9 I cut coffee/sugar out and stuck to a strict diet of chicken, ground turkey, pork and fish with a side of spinach/greens for most meals.
I saw a drastic improvement and for the first time in 9 years my face was clearing up. I started taking probiotics and saw an EXTREME flare up. My body was covered in what I presumed to be psoriasis.
This disintegrated all of my hope and I relapsed harder than ever.

I started to live a life with the mentality that I just wanted to eat what I wanted.
I started taking cannabis daily, edibles that were coated in sugar. This took ahold of me for about another year up until recently when I decided to love myself again.

I started by cutting cannabis out. This was by far the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I felt like there was pain in the core of my bones. Not realizing that cannabis is an immunosuppressant, my body was in shock.
I then started to clean up my diet slowly. Instead of gluten free cheese pizzas or gluten free sandwiches, I started eating meat again, cooking real meals. The change was minimal but I was determined. Then came cutting back the coffee and incorporating green tea daily (decaf). I experienced what I figured were severe die off symptoms. My face flared worse than ever and I felt like death. I pushed forward. Finally I cut out all sugar, I cut out everything except chicken and salmon. I started improving dramatically. I almost don’t even recognize my face anymore without all the sebborheic dermatitis.

I’m not quite out of the woods just yet, but I feel like I have my brain back. I can think, I can remember things. 

I plan on reintroducing things but I am ensuring I am 100% symptom free before doing so.

I know a lot of you are suffering, and I am so sorry for those of you who are experiencing this disastrous disease. Do not give up.

There are so many finer details to this, but I wanted to keep it a short read.

Hope you all are finding some comfort in life!",1,1754785394.0,Candida,0,1.0,False

[Back in 2014](https://www.synthtopia.com/content/2014/05/03/moog-intros-sub-phatty-synth-for-visually-impaired-players/) Moog made a limited number of Sub Phattys (Phatties?) with a Braille overlay for the benefit of players with visual impairments. As far as I'm aware, this is the only commercially released synthesizer with Braille applied at the factory.

One morning on a pre-coffee Facebook Marketplace scroll (never a good idea) I found one of these rare-ish synths. I called the number on the listing and was greeted by a cheerful Southern gentlemen named Doug. He told me that the Phatty he was selling belonged to his friend: the late Johnny Neel, a Nashville songwriter and session musician who most notably played keys with the Allman Brothers Band. According to Doug, Moog custom-built this one for Johnny after the promotion ended. I have no idea if any of this is true or not, but I'm certainly honored to have a small yet curious piece of synth history in my office.

Some of you may know that the plastic chassis of Moog synths of this era are coated with TPEs, which turns the surface into a sticky, goopy mess with enough time and use. Mine was no exception, so I grabbed some American walnut sides from [Noizzi Hardwood](https://noizzihardwood.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooEGiUBl8VrLHbBLcV54qAfH9vxXFWehaOFRue2w87rdG6PWWRf) out of Atlanta. They fit great and look even better in my opinion. If I ever pass this along (nope), any prospective buyer can restore the original sides themselves.

Claimed by My Sister's Husband

Chapter 1 With The Same Man
Elaine Valentine and her sister Stacy Valentine had fallen in love with the same man.
Cordell Decker.
Now, he was her brother-in-law.
When she first heard that her sister, Stacy, was going to marry Cordell, she made a firm decision to leave the country.
Her eyes reflected a sense of defeat and despair. ""I'm never coming back, and I won't bless you both.""
After leaving for abroad, she cut off all contact with everyone, even avoiding logging into WhatsApp for a long time.
That was, until one day when she suddenly called Marcelo Valentine, asking for a large sum of money. That was the first time she'd reached out to her family.
As she stepped out of the airport, Rubin Krueger, who had come to pick her up, immediately spotted her. He hurried over and took the suitcase from her hands. ""Ms. Valentine.""
She glanced around. Aside from Rubin, there was no one else to greet her. A bitter smile tugged at the corner of her lips.
At home, Stacy came forward to greet her. ""Elaine, you've finally come back.""
Three years had passed, and Stacy, now married, was even more beautiful than before.
She wore a light blue dress, with delicate butterfly embroidery at the collar. The high slit revealed her long, flawless legs.
Her hair, once long, had been cut short. The ends curled slightly, dyed a soft chestnut brown, accentuating her fair skin. She looked effortlessly chic and stunning.
She descended the stairs slowly, exuding the calm elegance of a wealthy young woman.
""Stacy,"" Elaine called softly, her voice lacking the usual softness and coquettish tone.
Stacy reached the bottom of the stairs and took in Elaine's appearance, noting how much thinner she had become. She looked almost skeletal.
Stacy's heart ached. ""Was life in Drego that tough?""
""It wasn't tough. Everything's fine,"" Elaine replied, always sticking to her default answer when asked about Drego—""Fine.""
Stacy knew Elaine's stubbornness. If Elaine didn't want to share, asking was pointless.
Noticing the fatigue in Elaine's eyes, she suggested, ""Why don't you rest upstairs for a while? After you wake up, I'll have the servants make your favorite dishes.""
""Okay,"" Elaine murmured, too tired to argue. She nodded and went upstairs, familiar with the house and making her way to the guest room with ease.
After a hot shower, she dried her hair and lay down on the bed, closing her eyes.
But her sleep wasn't peaceful. As usual, her dreams were strange and unsettling.
When she woke up, the evening had already settled in. She reached for her phone on the nightstand—it was already 9:30 PM.
She hadn't eaten much on the plane, and now she was starting to feel hungry.
She changed clothes and decided to head downstairs. As she stepped out of the guest room, she glanced down the hallway.
Stacy was on the sofa, watching a variety show, while the maid had placed a fruit platter on the coffee table.
Just as Elaine took a few steps down, she saw Cordell walking back inside. A servant quickly went to take his shoes and place them at his feet.
Her footsteps froze. She gripped the golden handrail tightly, her fingers curling into a fist.
Compared to three years ago, he was even more mature and charismatic, wearing a well-tailored dark suit and a white shirt, exuding a cold, clean aura.
He was bent over at the entrance, changing his shoes, and hadn't noticed her on the stairs.
She hesitated, wondering if she should continue down. She thought it would be awkward for all three of them, and just as she was about to turn back to her room, she heard Stacy's voice calling her name. ""Elaine.""
Her body stiffened. She instinctively bit her lip, her nails digging into her palm, the sharp pain spreading through her hand.
After a long pause, she turned around, her expression returning to its usual calm, with no hint of emotion.
Stacy was sitting on the sofa, looking at her, while Cordell, still at the entrance, had also turned his attention toward her.
She glanced at him briefly before subtly shifting her gaze, walking down the stairs. ""Stacy, I'm hungry.""
Stacy smiled warmly and called out, ""Janine.""
Janine Zavala emerged from the kitchen, and upon seeing Elaine walking down the stairs, she cheerfully greeted her, ""Ms. Valentine.""
Before Stacy married Cordell, Elaine used to visit the Decker family frequently, so the household staff all knew her.
Elaine had never been haughty, despite being from a wealthy family. She used to call Janine sweetly, and the maid had a good impression of her.
Cordell entered the living room, and Stacy effortlessly took his coat, hanging it up in the cloakroom. The way they interacted felt like an old married couple.
Elaine couldn't help but feel a sharp pang in her chest, as if a blade was cutting through her heart, leaving a painful, aching tightness.
Janine brought out the food prepared for her, and Elaine walked to the dining room. She casually asked, ""Where's Annie?""
Annie Ortiz was an old servant of the Decker family who had always been very fond of Elaine. Whenever she visited, Annie would prepare her favorite dishes and fruits.
Stacy, noticing the faint smell of alcohol on Cordell, asked the servant to prepare some coffee. Hearing Elaine's question, she replied, ""Annie's grandson is sick, so she took the day off.""
Cordell, looking tired, leaned back on the sofa. He glanced over at the dining table, where Elaine sat. Her face had lost its youthful roundness. The white dress she wore made her skin look porcelain-smooth, and her features were sharp and delicate.
She had lost a lot of weight, the baby fat completely gone. Her sharp chin made her eyes appear even larger and more striking. They were still as dark and bright as before.
Elaine wasn't eating much. She took only a few bites before setting her fork down.
Noticing the uneaten food, Janine asked, ""Ms. Valentine, isn't the food to your liking?""
It shouldn't be the case, as everything was prepared just as she liked it.
Before Elaine could respond, Cordell spoke up, ""You shouldn't eat too much at night.""
As soon as he said that, Elaine looked up and met his gaze.
Chapter 2 Always Alone
This was the first time in three years that Elaine looked directly at him, but after just a moment, she quickly averted her gaze.
Her eyes, as clear and dark as ever, no longer held the love they once did. Instead, they were calm and indifferent.
In that instant, his heart felt empty, and his gaze dimmed.
""Elaine, Mom and Dad went to Orevine to pick up Grandpa, so the house is empty. You should stay here for the next few days,"" Stacy said, adopting the tone of a considerate older sister. ""I can take care of you here at the Decker family home. You've been through so much on your own these past years.""
Even though Stacy knew about the past between Elaine and Cordell, she still invited her to stay at the Decker family house. If it weren't for Stacy's constant love and care, Elaine might have thought she was trying to make things awkward on purpose.
Though Stacy had an excellent reputation in high society—beautiful, graceful, and kind—inviting her husband's ex-girlfriend to stay in their home seemed a little too generous, even for her.
Despite being her sister, wouldn't any woman, in the name of protecting her marriage, be more cautious and guarded?
A faint, cold smile tugged at the corner of Elaine's lips. ""I've been alone in Drego all these years too.""
She had learned to survive in that strange, foreign place. Independence was something she had mastered. Besides, the Valentine family house was still home, and there were servants here.
Stacy looked at Elaine's thin face with concern. ""It's been three years since we've seen each other. Don't you want to catch up?""
""We'll have plenty of time for that,"" Elaine replied. Given the awkwardness between her and Cordell, there was really no reason to stay under the same roof. ""Stacy, please arrange for a driver to take me back to the Valentine family home.""
Cordell put down his coffee, grabbed his coat, and started to head upstairs. After taking a few steps, he paused. ""It's getting late. If you're leaving, maybe it's better to wait until tomorrow.""
Elaine glanced at the clock in the living room—it wasn't even 10:30 PM yet, hardly late. But seeing the look of expectation in Stacy's eyes, she hesitated for a moment before replying, ""Alright, I'll stay. Sorry for the trouble.""
As she spoke, Cordell, who had been halfway up the stairs, froze. Her polite, distant tone felt like a sharp knife, suddenly and painfully stabbing into his heart.
*****
Having just returned to the country, Elaine was still adjusting to the time difference. She spent the whole night tossing and turning, unable to sleep. When dawn finally broke, she managed to doze off for a short while.
She decided to head back to the Valentine family home that day. After waking up, she packed the clothes she'd worn the previous night, tidied up, and then headed downstairs.
In the living room, Cordell sat at the dining table in casual loungewear, reading the newspaper. A cup of milk and an untouched sandwich sat in front of him.
He looked up briefly, his expression serious as he read. When he heard her footsteps coming downstairs, he glanced over and called out, ""Janine."" The maid immediately set out her breakfast on the table.
Elaine walked over and sat down across from him, greeting him casually, ""Good morning.""
Cordell paused for a moment, then replied, ""Good morning.""
She found it strange. It was almost 8 AM—why was he still sitting here reading the newspaper? Wasn't he supposed to be going to work?
Her breakfast was the same as his: a sandwich, a cup of milk, and toast. She took a few bites of the sandwich, finished her milk, and then set down her napkin.
""Breakfast is important. You're eating too little,"" Cordell said, closing the newspaper. Her small appetite was honestly surprising.
Chapter 3 What Should I Call You?
""Mr. Decker."" Elaine dismissed his attempt to be considerate with a sharp, sarcastic smile, the corners of her mouth curling up. ""Focus on your own business and stop meddling in matters that have nothing to do with you.""
Her simple ""Mr. Decker"" landed like a heavy blow, a hammer crashing into his chest.
His face went pale. ""You're calling me Mr. Decker?""
She smirked, her tone turning cold and biting. ""What should I call you then?""
Cordell's face drained of color. He pressed his lips together, looking momentarily lost in thought. After a long silence, he finally muttered, ""Call me whatever you like.""
The atmosphere in the living room grew thick with tension. The servants, sensing the awkwardness between them, stayed far away.
""Cordell, Shauna seems to—"" Stacy's anxious voice broke the silence.
Stacy entered the room and noticed the strange tension between the two. She looked confused and asked, ""Elaine, you're up?""
Elaine turned to glance at the entrance. It was hard to ignore how well Stacy looked in her dress—her graceful features and tall, slender figure gave her the air of a woman from the early 20th century. She stood there effortlessly, exuding a refined, aristocratic charm.
But then, Elaine's gaze locked on something and her face went pale.
In Stacy's arms was a baby, dressed in pink, with tiny, chubby hands clutching her dress.
Stacy noticed where Elaine was looking and softly said, ""Elaine, this is Shauna Decker. She's just over a year old.""
If three years ago, when Cordell and Stacy married, her world had crumbled, then at this moment, it felt as though it had turned barren.
She clutched the edge of the table, doing everything she could to hide her shock and force herself to stay calm.
She should have seen it coming. They had been married for three years. Of course, they would have a child by now.
She remembered the days when they used to lie together, dreaming about the future. On the lawn behind the Decker family garden, she would lie in his arms, playing with his long, fair fingers.
""Cordell, what do you want to do after you graduate from college?""
He thought for a moment, then answered seriously, ""Work hard to make money, and then marry you.""
When he said that, her eyes, sparkling like stars, lit up with excitement. ""Then what?""
""Then you'll do your duty as my wife and give me a child. A daughter, ideally—one just like you, sweet and adorable. I'll spoil both of you.""
His tone was casual, but his gaze was intense and sincere.
Her heart soared with happiness, though she pretended to be coy, blushing as she playfully pinched his arm. ""You're impossible.""
Back then, she could think of nothing else but marrying Cordell after graduation.
""Then you'll need to think of a name for our daughter.""
""Let's call her Shauna.""
She wrinkled her nose in distaste. ""That's too ordinary. You're a top student at Hillcrest Academy, and you give your daughter such a lazy name? She'll probably disown you when she grows up.""
""But you and she will be my only ones."" He wasn't good with sweet talk, and after saying that, his ears turned red.
She hugged him tightly in excitement and kissed his cheek. ""Alright, but we agreed—the name Shauna will only be her nickname. You'll have to come up with a real name later, or else I'm worried she'll resent us when she grows up.""
Elaine smiled softly, her eyes clouded with a thin layer of mist. She forced herself to hold back the emotions, almost as if she were mocking herself, murmuring softly, ""I'm an aunt now. That's fine.""
Chapter 4 Your Next Lover
Elaine walked over to Stacy, her gaze falling on the child in her arms.
Shauna's skin was as smooth and white as porcelain, like a little doll. Her chubby cheeks were a soft pink, and her big, round eyes were as dark and shiny as marbles, making her irresistibly cute.
A mist seemed to form in Elaine's eyes as she reached out and gently touched the baby's soft cheek. It felt as smooth as a freshly peeled egg, soft and tender under her fingertips.
This was his daughter, Shauna.
She paused for a moment, then gave a bitter smile.
He had a wife. He had a child. His daughter was named Shauna—the name that matched the daughter they had once imagined having together.
Stacy noticed Elaine's discomfort, but with everything happening, she couldn't focus on it. Her voice became urgent. ""Cordell, Shauna has diarrhea.""
Cordell immediately stood up, walking quickly toward them. He glanced at the baby in Stacy's arms before grabbing the car keys from the coffee table. ""We're going to the hospital.""
Elaine instinctively took a step forward to follow, but then stopped after just a couple of steps.
In his arms was his wife. His wife was holding their child. What was she supposed to do?
Watching them leave, Elaine bit her lip, clenching her hands by her sides. A faint, metallic taste lingered in her mouth.
*****
The Silver Oak Grand Hotel was the largest in Aleshire, grand and opulent. The corridors were lined with deep purple, embroidered carpets, and the crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling looked like a blooming white flowers, beautiful and sparkling.
With a soft chime, the elevator doors opened, and Elaine stepped out.
She wore a white dress with beige high heels. Her face was calm and pale, with a quiet elegance, and her tall, slender figure stood out as she walked.
She made her way straight to the presidential suite. Before arriving, she had learned that Jackson Mason had a long-term suite here at the Silver Oak Grand Hotel, one he used for his affairs.
To put it simply, ""affairs"" meant a lot more than casual meetings.
As she raised her hand to knock on the door, it suddenly swung open from the inside. A woman, crying and hiding her face, rushed past her, disheveled, clutching her purse tightly as she left in a hurry.
Jackson changed lovers every three months. He had just broken up with his last one a few days ago, so this woman... had her attempts to seduce him failed?
Elaine pushed the half-open door the rest of the way open and stepped inside. Her heart skipped a beat with nervousness as she scanned the room. It was empty, except for the sound of water running from the bathroom.
She tossed her handbag onto the couch and waited. After a moment, the bathroom door opened.
She turned her head at the sound, and her gaze fell on the man's strong, sculpted body. His handsome face was slightly flushed from the steam, and his wet, black hair clung to his forehead, with droplets of water glistening on his skin.
His chest, a smooth honey-tan, was flat and toned, and as the water from his hair dripped onto his chest, it followed a path down his body, slipping under the towel wrapped loosely around his waist.
This man—he was even more strikingly handsome than any celebrity.
When Jackson saw someone unexpectedly standing in the room, his brows furrowed in irritation. ""Get out.""
Elaine's cheeks flushed slightly. She cleared her throat to hide her embarrassment.
He was simply too good-looking.
It felt as if God had been extra kind to him when creating him.
Taking a deep breath, she steadied herself and then stated, ""Mr. Mason, I'm here to apply for the position of your next lover.""
Chapter 5 It Won't Be a Loss
Elaine was naturally shy, and saying something like that was difficult for her.
Once she spoke, her delicate face turned a soft pink, glowing under the light, her skin vibrant and radiant.
Her skin was flawless—smooth and pale like jewel. Her cheeks were soft and rosy, almost baby-like, so tender that they seemed to invite a gentle touch. Her beauty was pure but also had a subtle charm.
Jackson narrowed his eyes, looking her over slowly. His thin lips curled into a sarcastic smile. ""Not every woman who comes knocking gets what she wants.""
Elaine blushed with both embarrassment and frustration. The flush on her fair skin made her look even more captivating and radiant, while her clear eyes shone brightly.
She bit her lip and, gathering courage, moved closer to him, wrapping her arms around his waist—but not pressing her body against his.
She lifted her chin, meeting his gaze. ""So, what do you think of me?""
""Need money?"" His eyes twinkled with amusement as he glanced at her arms wrapped around him, as delicate as lotus stems.
""You're handsome. Being with you wouldn't be a loss,"" she said, flashing a smile. The chandelier overhead sparkled in her dark eyes.
Jackson scoffed. ""Is that all?""
She paused, thinking for a moment, then shook her head. ""That's it.""
He'd met plenty of women like her before, but none had been this blunt.
He couldn't help but look at her a little longer.
After a long silence, as he still hadn't spoken, Elaine raised her gaze to meet his deep, unreadable eyes. Slowly, her eyes traveled down his face until they landed on his thin, sculpted lips.
Standing on tiptoe, she leaned in. Just as her lips were about to brush against his, Jackson pulled away.
His voice was cold and detached. ""Go take a shower first.""
""Okay."" She responded quietly, heading to the bathroom, turning on the water, and standing under the shower, her heart pounding loudly.
For a brief moment, she regretted acting so impulsively. She stayed in the bathroom, hesitating for a while, before putting on a bathrobe. Taking a deep breath, she finally opened the bathroom door.
Jackson was leaning against the headboard, watching as she stepped out. The steam from the shower left a soft pink glow on her face, and the bathrobe was loosely tied, exposing her delicate collarbone, her skin flawless and smooth.
Elaine tugged at the bathrobe, which was clearly too big for her. It was Jackson's, and it hung loosely, almost to her ankles, looking slightly comical.
Seeing her awkwardly clutching the robe, Jackson frowned slightly. ""If you regret it, you can leave now.""
Elaine hesitated, then bit her lower lip, moving closer and slowly untying the bathrobe.
Though she was slender, her figure was well-proportioned, and her skin glowed like fine porcelain, smooth and radiant under the light.
She bent down to kiss him, but her inexperience showed in her tentative, unsure movements. Jackson turned his head slightly, avoiding her. ""No experience?""
Her face instantly flushed, and she wished she could bury her head in the pillow. She barely whispered, ""No.""
Jackson's gaze flickered to her flushed cheeks, and he noticed her long, dark lashes trembling slightly, revealing her nervousness and uncertainty.
He wasn't someone who believed in being morally perfect, so he didn't expect others to be either. But seeing her so shy and flustered made him pause for a moment.
Elaine lowered her eyes, waiting for him to react. After a long silence, feeling embarrassed, she almost wanted to pull back entirely.
She tried to move away from him, but in the next moment, he grabbed the back of her head, pulling her face down, flipping them over in one smooth motion.
Everything seemed to spin, and Elaine, panicked, clung to his neck, her eyes wide with a momentary sense of confusion.
As they switched positions, she found herself staring up at his handsome face, her breath catching in her throat.
Chapter 6 The Rules
The light from above cast a shadow across Jackson's handsome face as he fixed his gaze on her. ""What's your name?"" he asked.
Elaine's face turned slightly pale, and she answered slowly, each word measured. ""Elaine.""
""Have you thought this through? It's not too late to change your mind."" Jackson gave her one final chance.
Uncomfortable, Elaine shifted slightly. Jackson's expression darkened as he growled, ""Don't move!""
Startled, Elaine froze, her eyes locked on him. Her body became stiff and tense.
She was so nervous that her breath came in short, uneven bursts, causing her to speak a little more quickly than usual. ""I've thought about it carefully. I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.""
She had been mulling it over for days before making the decision.
On her way here, she had almost reconsidered for a moment, but...
At that thought, a self-deprecating smile tugged at the corner of her mouth, and her eyes dimmed with a touch of sadness.
Jackson noticed the shift in her expression, sensing the faint sorrow on her face. His heart stirred slightly. ""How much do you need?""
Elaine blinked in confusion. ""What?""
Jackson furrowed his brow, his tone cool. ""How much money do you need?""
She stared at him, slightly stunned. His jawline was sharp and perfectly defined, and for a moment, she lost herself in the details of his face before quickly snapping out of it. With a soft smile, she responded, ""You can decide.""
Jackson raised an eyebrow, a hint of irritation in his expression.
She smiled again, her voice soft. ""Mr. Mason isn't the type to be stingy, so I'm not worried you'll give me too little.""
She had once thought that when she turned twenty, she would give the most precious thing she had to Cordell, the man she had loved for so long.
Jackson studied her for a moment, then leaned down to kiss her.
*****
Afterward, Jackson pulled away and got up to head into the bathroom.
Elaine grabbed the blanket and pulled it around her, her gaze vacant as she stared at the ceiling. The crystal chandelier above cast a bright light, making her face look as pale as paper.
The sound of running water from the bathroom was loud in the quiet room.
A short while later, Jackson emerged from the bathroom and entered the walk-in closet. When he came back out, he was dressed, sharp and impeccably put together.
The deep blue shirt fit him perfectly, and his trousers highlighted his long, lean legs. His features were sharp, almost sculpted, and his dark eyes were especially striking under the light.
Elaine had gathered herself by then. Apart from her slightly red eyes, she seemed composed.
Jackson pulled out a pen and paper, writing a check and placing it on the nightstand. His eyes were void of emotion.
""Leave your contact information when you leave. I'll call you if I need anything.""
He picked up his custom-made watch from the table and strapped it on, then walked toward the door. After taking a few steps, he stopped, not turning around. His voice was flat and distant.
""You should have done your homework before coming. Do you know what the rules are?""
She answered softly, ""I know.""
Jackson's women were only meant to last for three months. During that time, if he needed anything, they had to be available whenever he called. They couldn't visit him at his company or cause any trouble. After three months, they were to part ways without further contact.
Chapter 7 She's Not Liked
Jackson's women had a shelf life of three months. During that time, if he needed anything, they had to be at his beck and call. They weren't allowed to visit him at his company or cause trouble. Once the three months were up, they were expected to leave and not look back.
Rumor had it that Jackson was cold and indifferent by nature, yet women still flocked to him, eager to get into his bed.
Not only was he rich and powerful, but he also treated women generously. After the three months were over, they were sent off with a generous severance package.
Jackson didn't linger. He opened the door and left.
Elaine picked up the check from the bedside table, staring at the figure written on it. A self-mocking smile tugged at her lips. 170 thousand dollars...
Because Cordell didn't need her, she had given the most precious thing she had to a stranger.
This man, in both looks and background, was no less impressive than Cordell, so she wasn't losing out, right?
Then why did it hurt so much? The kind of pain that came from being discarded but still unwilling to let go.
A cold tear slid down her cheek, and she bit her wrist, trying to stop herself from crying.
*****
The Valentine family estate had been passed down through generations. It was a grand, old house that resembled a castle, with ivy crawling up the red brick walls, the green vines bright and striking in the sunlight.
Tall, sturdy sycamore trees lined the yard, the flowerbeds were neat and beautiful, and the fountain sparkled like a goddess scattering flowers. In the summer, walking along the shady paths beneath the trees was cool and refreshing.
Elaine had a lounge chair set up by the flowerbed on the lawn. She sat quietly, reading a book, with a cup of coffee resting on the small glass table beside her. It was a scene of perfect peace, like stealing a few moments of blissful calm.
Olivia hurried over, her voice filled with excitement. ""Ms. Valentine, your father and grandfather are back.""
""I know,"" Elaine replied, closing her book. She composed herself and walked back to the living room.
In the living room, an elderly man in his sixties sat on the sofa, dressed in a traditional suit. He held a finely carved cane and wore a ring on his thumb, his graying hair perfectly groomed.
Beside him sat a couple who looked weary from travel. The man wore a suit, and the woman wore a deep purple dress, draped with a beige shawl. They exuded an air of wealth and elegance.
Elaine changed her shoes at the entrance and walked into the living room. ""Grandfather, Dad, Mom.""
Marcelo gave a brief nod. In contrast to his indifference, Constance Valentine eagerly stepped forward, gently touching Elaine's thin face, her eyes glistening with tears. ""Elaine, you've lost weight.""
Elaine opened her mouth, about to respond, but just then, a cold snort echoed through the quiet room.
She turned her gaze toward the sound, meeting the stern eyes of her grandfather Abraham Valentine, who glared at her. ""So, you finally decided to come back?""
She pressed her lips together and remained silent.
Abraham had never liked her.
After Constance lost a lot of blood during her birth and couldn't have more children, the male line of the Valentine family was cut off with Marcelo.
The Valentine family had vast wealth, and someone had to inherit it. Abraham had suggested that Marcelo take a mistress, have a son, and bring him into the family, paying the woman off and sending her away from Aleshire.
Marcelo and Constance had been high school classmates, and their relationship had been solid ever since. They started dating in college and had been happily married for many years.
Marcelo had firmly rejected Abraham's proposal, and the two often argued about it, to the point that Abraham once became so angry he had to be hospitalized.
Chapter 8 Like an Outsider
Because of this, Marcelo had always been more affectionate toward Stacy than Elaine, treating her with indifference.
Moreover, since Abraham never liked her, Elaine was sent to live with her grandmother of the maternal line in Prarc Town when she was young. She stayed there until her grandmother passed away when she was thirteen, at which point she was brought back to the Valentine family.
Elaine stood stiffly, and Constance quickly stepped in to help. ""Dad, Elaine came back specifically for your 80th birthday, which is in two weeks. She wanted to wish you well."" She then shot Elaine a pointed look.
Elaine pretended not to notice and stayed silent. If it hadn't been for Constance's repeated insistence, she wouldn't have returned for such an insignificant birthday celebration.
In the Valentine family, only Constance and Stacy treated her with any kindness. However, ever since Stacy married Cordell, there had been a distance between them.
To be fair, it was a distance that only she felt.
Stacy still treated her with the same care—checking on her when she was sick, asking about her daily well-being.
Elaine had struggled with this for a long time, which led her to deliberately distance herself from Stacy, and as a result, their relationship was no longer as close as it once had been.
Marcelo didn't want her return to disrupt the family's peace, so he joined in with Constance, saying, ""Dad, Elaine called me a few days ago to ask what kind of gift you'd like. She's really put a lot of thought into choosing something special for you.""
If it hadn't been for Marcelo's reminder, Elaine would have completely forgotten about preparing a gift. Thankfully, she still had two weeks, plenty of time to find something fitting for Abraham.
When Marcelo said this, Abraham held back his anger, though his face remained stern.
Elaine didn't mind, though. In her memories, Abraham had always been like this—stern and unapproachable.
The only time he had been genuinely warm was when she was sixteen. She had scored first in the entire school and was accepted into a prestigious high school. That same year, Stacy had used the family's connections to get into the same school.
Just then, the phone in the living room rang. Constance, who was standing next to it, picked up the receiver.
After a brief conversation, she smiled brightly. ""Okay, got it.""
She hung up the phone and turned to Abraham. ""Dad, Stacy and Cordell know you're back today. They've made a reservation at a restaurant to welcome you.""
Abraham's expression softened slightly. ""Stacy is such a thoughtful child.""
Before long, Stacy and Cordell arrived at the Valentine family home to pick everyone up for dinner.
As soon as Stacy entered the living room, she walked over and hugged Abraham's arm before sitting beside him. Her delicate makeup only made her appear even more graceful and lovely.
""Grandpa, I've missed you so much these days. How was your time in Orevine?""
Abraham clearly appreciated her affection. A rare smile appeared on his usually stern face. ""I'm well. Everything is fine. But why didn't you bring Shauna?""
Stacy smiled brightly. ""We're going out later, so it's not convenient to bring her along.""
In the evening, the group went to the restaurant, where the waiter led them to a private dining room.
Stacy sat to Abraham's right, and throughout the meal, she kept the conversation lively with amusing stories that made him laugh heartily.
Abraham shared stories about Orevine's customs and scenery, and everyone listened attentively.
The conversation flowed smoothly, but Elaine sat quietly, feeling out of place at the family gathering.
She felt suffocated, like an outsider, and eventually excused herself, saying she needed to use the bathroom, before quietly slipping away from the table.
Chapter 9 She's from Valentine family
As Elaine opened the door to the private room, she found herself face to face with someone exiting the opposite room. Their eyes met, and they both paused for a moment.
Out of politeness, she was about to greet him with a ""Mr. Mason,"" but the words got stuck in her throat.
Jackson gave her a brief glance, walking past her as if she were a stranger, his eyes not lingering for even a second.
Watching his tall, straight figure retreat, she awkwardly rubbed her nose. Noticing he was headed toward the restroom, she decided against going herself.
She walked down the hallway to the end, lingering in a quiet corner near the stairs, where she distracted herself with her phone. When she saw it was nearly time, she tucked her phone away and made her way back to the private room.",1,1754785290.0,Novelnews,2,0.67,False

After many months of late nights, bug hunts, and far too much coffee, my VR chess game Onboard Chess is officially live on the Oculus Store! 🥳

It’s a fully immersive chess experience where you can play real opponents in virtual reality, or login to your Lichess account and play against players online. I knew nothing about Unity or game development when I built this, wrangling everything from networking to shaders and optimization, so it’s been a huge learning journey.

1mm4erh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1mm4erh/no_surf_progress_reportsuccess_and_something_that/,No Surf Progress Report/Success- And Something That Startled Me,"Long time lurker here. I have always been a late adopter of tech - Gchat, Facebook, Instagram, even smart phones which I didn't have until 2015 (I was 23 when I got my first smart phone, gave it up after a year as it made me nervous, and then got one for full time use in 2021) . I was always really wary of technology use because I didn't understand why things like sharing locations or being open online were things that weren't okay back in the early 2000s and then were suddenly okay 5 years later.

My screen time gradually crept up to around 6 hours or more a day. I have other stuff going on but I always felt panicky and upset when I used social media. I started using a blocking app and it wouldn't really work, I would always bypass it. However, I have greatly improved my screen time use to where I only use social media for work (on my work computer where I can't scroll and am only on for 45 minutes). and my personal social media use is down to 15 minutes a week. I am averaging around 90 minutes of time on my phone a day, most of that on apps like texting, using Spotify (which just requires the phone to be connected to my speakers, not me being on it) or (get this) using the actual phone to talk to my loved ones. 

What changed for me:

\- I switched to ScreenZen, and forcing myself to breathe and consider why I was opening an app made a difference. I used to open my email and banking apps many times a day - anything to satisfy the dopamine itch - so I also blocked those too.

\- I completely deleted Insta, FB, and reddit off my phone and only use it on desktop.

\- I made a conscious effort to fill screen time with other things - like reading books, journaling, exercise, and crafting. All of which I love and have done for years even with the smart phone, but now I can devote even more time to them.

\- I also realized that most of the ""connecting"" that I was doing on social media was jut people sending me memes or reels. I wasn't missing out on anything. I was missing out on all the cool things going on in my city, however. The people I really wanted to connect with would text me or we would talk on the phone while I was cooking or doing chores and I learned a lot more about what was going on in their lives.

\- I had a lot of trouble focusing on books even though I love reading. I started listening to audio books of books I already owned and then found that I could read the book faster than the audiobook so switched to doing that. I read Stolen Focus, as well as a lot of articles on AI, social media and addiction, and would freewrite in response to prompts about what I would do if I ""got my life back"" from social media.

\- I also bought a ksafe for my phone and worked on my personal projects at a wifi free coffee shop. I would lock the phone away for 90 minutes at a time. This made a huge difference as not only was I not able to access my phone, but I also realized how panicky I would get when I couldn't get it. This clued me in - I had an addiction. And I couldn't get to the thing that I was addicted to. So that really emphasized that I was making the right choice. Several people in public have come up to me and asked me where they could get the kSafe for their own use.

The real turning point for me was about six weeks ago. I went on a long distance backpacking trip (like I do every summer) where I went days without service. When I logged back on Instagram to post photos of my trip, I realized that I didn't really want to -- the app just felt like a kick in the head. It was much more fun to tell people about the trip in person. I feel like I finally ""flipped"" the switch.

Since I left on the trip and came back, I've read 4 books in a month. I've filled a 180 page notebook with writing and started another notebook and am already 35 pages in. I don't feel the pull of my phone--it feels overwhelming and unsafe rather than fun. I'm starting to save up for a small photo printer so I can scrapbook my memories instead of using social media. 

The biggest difference is that I no longer feel panicky. I no longer feel like I'm running out of time and that my life is disappearing or that people won't contact me. Instead I get off work at 5 pm and am amazed how much time I have during my day to craft and write and do things I like. I cook meals, I do my chores and I still have several hours before bed--and I'm waking up at 6:30 in the morning so I have time before work to relax and enjoy things. I'm reading and doing projects on my lunch break as opposed to scrolling. 

I also had a big AHA/scary moment during the trip. My mom is approaching 70 and has always been an avid reader and crafter. I noticed when I visited her that even though she is mostly retired, and she spent some time gardening each day and talking to neighbors, a lot of what she did was scroll Facebook and Instagram and watch Netflix. I asked her what happened to her crafting and book projects and she said that ever since the pandemic, when the library closed, she stopped reading books and started scrolling the internet instead.

This was scary to me especially since my mom used to read around 60 books a year and completed elaborate craft projects or paintings every month. She had gone most of her life without social media and now in her late sixties she's also scrolling all the time.

The good news is that after talking to her about it, I've convinced her to join an exercise and book club and spend more time out of the house or off the screen. I'm hoping she can get her focus back.

EDIT - additional details and switching - originally I mistyped that I was ""down to 15 hours a week"" when I'm actually down to 15 minutes lol. ",1,1754784885.0,nosurf,1,1.0,False

a golden age…

You meet someone in your same hemisphere who… like you… has been through some experience… sleeps with a small dog on her head… and has a heart walking outside of her body as well… who looks to the same sky with constant amazement… and loves to read you describe it so… from your perspective in the 505…

… she smiles reading your double entendres of her fashion pictures in a mid-day spark… and strategizes over coffee at COB… a cappuccino mix of Hepburn’s Sabrina’s letter writing and Bukowski’s poetry…. a safe space of respect, trust and open communication to see a partner “La vie en rose”… and still help each other grow into our best selves one step at a time… “straight to perfect laughter…”  

A stunning woman who is the embodiment of beauty… beyond American English… or French… beyond words itself…  a musicality of it all… 
a verse… in the ‘verse…

… and a microcosm inside… 

… a world full of handsome and beautiful folks… no doubt… who only need a someone to tell them so… 

.. but one day if you focus on your light more than your shadows… you might just find a one and only… where you are the only one in all of the turn of worlds brave enough to be handsome for her… 

and you awaken to endless possibilities… because you are not who you were… you now have a clear view through her eyes to a heart full… just for you… and you her… 

wraps around you like the late-summer’s sun as the swallowtails flutter by on a crisp high-desert breeze to settle into the ‘brush… for a quiet peaceful evening… 

“Constant… total… amazement…”

…as my Cherokee brown gaze into her shamrock green… a hidden spark… a reflection… of golden rays betwixt shades of violets as dusk settles and gives way to stardust through midnight blues… 

a glimpse into the face of God… 

in a garden of full technicolors nestled beside the river… between the slate volcanic west and the evergreen heights to the east… Where time and space collide in the 505… in the in-between…

We will be adding more plants (we have four longer hanging pots coming for the bay windows and a larger plant for by that window, too), and we are considering curtains as well. 
We're open to any (gentle) feedback, but my main questions are:

1) what should we do in that corner that currently has the globe and art? We've considered adding shelves, a tall plant, or leaving it empty
2) we want to add seating of some sort to the bay window, but we don't have a ton of space. Do we do one larger chair? Two matching smaller chairs? Something else? 
3) should we switch out our dining chairs? If so for what?
4) is there anything that looks too cluttered or should be reorganized/removed? 
5) we currently have a small side table with the couch because we didn't think a coffee table would fit. Should we switch it up for a console table or a matching set of end tables?

1mm4bfu,https://i.redd.it/9lydtsyb33if1.jpeg,Mantras,"There are still so many mornings I wake up to those familiar messages.  The ones that tell me I have no right to live, that this world would be a better place without me or at least completely unaffected by my absence.  Some days I can get these voices to shut up with enough coffee, enough things to focus on, enough jobs to do.   Some days I can't.  Some days those voices become so pervasive that it becomes difficult to even focus on what I'm supposed to be doing, difficult to participate in a conversations I need to be present for.   There are the days it seems impossible to even form coherent thought, there is only the same steady drum beat of my failures, the steady drum beat reminding me that I am an oxygen thief.

 

Maybe some of the reason I can't make these voices go in a way is that at some level I know they're true.  There's nothing inherently special about me that gives me to the right to consume oxygen, nothing about me that makes me any more worthy of the food I eat than anyone else.  I live with the knowledge that this world is so often a harsh and cold place, full of cruelty and injustice, one where people far more worthy of the oxygen they breathe have that privilege taken from them on a daily basis.  I live with the knowledge that were I to cease to be, the world would go on.  Someone else would farm my ground; they might even do a better job than me.  Someone else would live in my home and perhaps its walls would know the happiness of laughter and the squeals of children as they played with each other. Sounds they’ll never hear so long as I am here.  Whether there would be a funeral is uncertain, so much of the family quit talking to me once I began transitioning.  Perhaps I would show up as support for my parents and my siblings.  Perhaps my last contribution to society could be one more family get together. One where they would try to talk about anything but how I turned out.

 

And yet, even if all of that is entirely true it’s not my choice to make.  That my last act can't be for me to cause hurt to others.  The regardless how worthless I might feel, that I've never seen a case where somebody chose to punch out that didn't cause immense amounts of pain for their family.  I've never seen a case where didn't leave scars on families for decades to come,  scars that cut far deeper than whatever failure it was that caused them to punch out.  Part of me knows that I simply don't have the courage to do it.  I've been there before, even though it was decades ago, I can still taste the cleaning oil that had protected the steel.   I didn't have the guts to do it then, why would I think I had the guts to do that now.

 

And so I muddle on, one day at a time, one foot in front of the other.  I try to remind myself that my story isn't over yet,   there are still chapters waiting to be written. Chapters that may yet provide some meaning to this existence I live.  Chapters that require me to make it through the chapter I am currently in.  Chapters that require me to keep holding on, to keep trying.  Chapters that require me to remember those other mantras I had once tried so hard to espouse.  *Readily will I display the intestinal fortitude required to fight onto the objective and complete the mission though I be the lone survivor.*

 

Yet, that's so much harder when you're not sure what your objectives are anymore.    It was so much easier when someone else picked them, when your existence could be boiled down to three words; task, mission, execute.    Even if everything fell apart you could still find worth in knowing that you had given it your 110% and then some.   Sometimes it seems like everything got so much more confusing when I took that uniform off.  Now I live with the knowledge that my failures are 100% the result of my decisions.  Now I live with the feeling like I'm pulled and 16 million different directions all at the same time, the need to please others the need to find some sort of happiness for myself. The requirements of work.   So far I've been proved incapable of satisfying all three at the same time.

 

What is that mission now? I'm not really sure. The never ending treadmill of planting and harvesting crops in an arid and unrewarding environment?  The need to find some version of me I'm actually okay with?  The need to find some sort of peace with the damage that was caused when I chose to transition?   It seems so self-centered.  I've heard it said that you find your greatest meaning in sacrifice to others.  In some ways I know it's true, some of the most rewarding experiences of my life have been when I decided that my life didn't matter.  Why did I forget that?  Why did I choose to make a priority of something that I wanted, when it was the exact opposite of what everyone else wanted from me.   It's a question I haven't been able to answer yet, the one that waits for me every night when I step through the door of what used to be our home.

 

I’ve started counseling sessions with a mental therapist again,   I hope it's helpful, but it's hard for me to see how it can be when you've spent so much of your life learning how to hate yourself.  Part of me knows that I deserve that self-hatred, part of me knows it's a pretty heavy rock to carry around in your rucksack all the time.   That maybe it would be nice to actually like who I am, to be able to find peace with the mistakes I’ve made in live, to be able to live with something other than the drumbeat of my failures.  I don't know what that mantra would be, but I really hope I find it.",6,1754784615.0,TransLater,1,1.0,False

What I found was a sermon disguised as a story, laced with homophobia and misogyny.","I am truly so fucking angry. I feel like my months of therapy I've gotten for religious trauma and dealing with homophobic parents have been just reversed.

Basically my mom decided to write a book, dramatizing her experience from when she married a man with a daughter, and having a new stepdaughter. My mom portrays herself as Tessa, the MC. She also writes this during the timeline of when she was pregnant with me IRL. This ""step-daughter"" in the book is supposed to be evil, giving her stepmom dangerous herbs for the baby, pushing her down the stairs, putting nair in her shampoo, poisoning her chocolates, sleeping with her teacher and using it as blackmail, then falsely accusing their neighbor of SA. Keep in mind the stepdaughter in the book is supposed to be 15. Also my half-sister would not do any of this. That's disturbing enough on its own.

The writing is shit, and the characters have no depth or development. I say this as someone who is writing a book of my own (unrelated to any of this). When there's not unnecessary descriptions of a random fucking coffee shop or a three-page monologue regarding a side plot that adds nothing to the story, my mom FILLED this book with religious ideas.

For background I came out to my mom as a lesbian over 6 months ago, and her reaction was vile. She said ""you can't be gay, you've dated a man before!"" and ""Oh, you're just confused"" and ""You know, many women victims of male SA often become lesbians because of it. That's not you"" and ""Homosexuality is a choice"". Disgusting shit. We sort of have an unspoken, unwritten agreement to just not talk about it. And she treats me the same, acts like she still loves me,but I just have this bitter spot in my heart for her. The therapy I've been getting for it has helped, but when I got to page 130 of this disgrace of a fucking book it all shattered.

>""But man did, Tessa thought as her eyes began to grow heavy. Man's code of ethics changed with the times. Just look at the abortion laws, or even now, the gay marriage laws that were passing in states across the nation with lightning speed, as though man had been living in the Dark Ages for the past two thousand years, had awoken to realize that they were Neanderthals for not having passed same-sex marriage laws thousands of years ago. But just fifty years or so ago abortions were against the law, and the only way a woman could get one was to find a doctor willing to break the law. Not even thirty years ago homosexuals lived their lives in the closet and most people agreed that homosexuality was unnatural; today if you voiced that opinion, you'd be considered an intolerant, bigoted homophobe.""

Just disgusting to read. I still can't get over the fact SHE WANTED ME TO READ THIS VILE GARBAGE. I'm glad her ass got scammed by an agent and had to resort to self publishing. This does not belong on the shelves of any self-respecting bookstore. I'm glad only three other people, including me, have read this book.

She also added in a character who I assume is meant to represent her now late sister, who is Thea in the story. This is what she wrote about her...

>""But Thea was a liberated woman. Didn't want her man telling her what she could or could not do. Wanted to do whatever it was that came to mind and didn't think it necessary to inform her husband. Believed that a woman should oversee the household, in charge of the kids, in charge of the finances; basically, that she should wear the pants in the family. If they'd been young women in the sixties and seventies, Thea would have been the first girl to burn her bra.""

And then all of the religious shit she added in there makes her sound like her character is going through some kind of fucking religious psychosis. Like this part below literally comes right after the first homophobic quote. Also for context she created this random quilt full of bible verses solely as a vehicle to get her religious points across to the reader (adds absolutely nothing to the story)

>""And what would Tessa pass on to her daughter? (Apparently not a god-fearing heterosexual)

>Tessa's eyes traveled over the quilt aimlessly. Something she'd never noticed previously now jumped out at her, glaring in its obviousness: in every passage in which the word righteousness was written, Mrs. Vaughn had highlighted the word with bright blue thread, so that the word itself appeared to leap out of each inscribed scripture on the quilt. Indeed, it appeared to serve as the focal point for the entire quilt, a theme of some sort. Tessa's eyes roved the blanket, jumping from passage to passage:

>""*your* RIGHTEOUS *judgments endures forever... Your* RIGHTEOUSNESS *is an everlasting righteousness...*RIGHTEOUS *are you, oh* LORD *you* RIGHTEOUSNESS, *O God, is very high. verily there is a reward for the* RIGHTEOUS... *he shall judge the world with* RIGHTEOUSNESS, *and his people with his truth...*

>And then there was this one, which, in some way Tessa could not quite understand, seemed to tie all those other verses together:

>*And it shall be our* RIGHTEOUSNESS *if we observe to do all these commandments before the* Lord *our God, as be has commanded us.*

>Oh, and here was another one, equally compelling: "" *...touching the* RIGHTEOUSNESS, *which is in the law, blameless...""*

I posted about this in a different subreddit and someone said it sounded like the mom from *Carrie* could've written this. Honestly seeing people slander this writing has been one of the few things that have brought me peace regarding this situation. My mom doesn't know I've read her book yet. I'm considering burning the damn thing too.

Idk if I want advice or support or anything. I just felt a huge bout of rage today and need to let it out. Sorry if this is too long or if I'm not in the right subreddit for this.

edited to fix a caption thingy. Also the whole point of this post is I am just angry. I am really angry and don't know how to act around my mom sometimes.

1mm481l,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mm481l/balloon_animals/,Balloon Animals,"

""What are you a fucking clown now?""

Kai bought them as a joke;  a 50 pack of size 260 latex balloons in assorted colors; the kind you used for balloon animals.  It was a circus themed party after all.  They always themed their parties, made it more likely that people would show up.  Since moving in last semester, Kai and his roommate Jeremy had hosted a half dozen certified ragers, and many more informal chill sessions.  The first one had been a luau, they put a kiddie pool in the living room and filled it with the hose from the front yard;  just one of many benefits of living off-campus.  Then Kai took a dive into the pool and they had to rent a carpet cleaner to soak it all up.  The house smelled like feet for a week and a half.  There had been the obligatory Halloween party, but it fell on a Friday that year, so a lot of people showed up but didn't stay long.  They thought it would be funny if they both dressed as the Joker.  Jeremy called Heath Ledger and Kai bizarrely chose Jared Leto.  They stayed up all night drinking grey goose and watching old movie trailers.

There had been other parties, but this one was going to be the biggest yet.  They'd set up drinking versions of carnival games, where if you win, you get a shot;  but if you lose, you had to take a shot.  They had their signature, weapons grade hunch punch, but also snacks: popcorn, cotton candy, and big bowls of circus peanuts.  They really went all out,  even rented a bounce house, which they got a deal on because they used the same guy for their foam party.  Jeremy tried to make a bet to see who would be the first to hook up in that thing, but Kai said it wasn't fair because he didn't have a girlfriend.  That was kind of the idea behind the balloons.  He'd learn a few basic designs, and maybe a few NSFW ones and he'd be a hit with the ladies.  What could go wrong?

""No thank you, I'm allergic to latex,""

""That's OK, I'll just pull out""

She'd smacked him so hard the balloon popped.  It was a giant dick, the only thing he'd managed to learn how to make before the party.  Kai was back in his Halloween costume, but it obviously wasn't reading as circus.  The first time he dipped a balloon dick in someone's beer, he'd gotten some legitimate laughs.  That's because it had been an accident.  An hour later, and he'd dipped that same balloon in almost everybody's drink and people were starting to get pissed.  He was way too drunk for this party.  He'd downed half a bottle of Beefeater's by himself to pregame.  He wanted Jeremy to drink with him, but he had sworn off gin after the speakeasy party.  He'd frantically eaten a bowl of popcorn right before people started to show up in hopes that it would soak up some of the alcohol, but all it did was add texture to his vomit.  It had not been a good night.  Kai and Jeremy had fought that night, but only Jeremy would remember it in the morning.

The next day Jeremy went to Rachel's house and Kai spent the entire day cleaning, mostly the usual post-rager trash, beer cans and solo cups.  But this time, there were the balloons too.  Dicks, maybe three dozen in all, of various combinations of length and girth, each one a different color.  He didn't remember making them all; definitely not during the part of the party he remembered.  In a weird way he was proud, until he had to pop them, and his brain, still reeling from the night before, threatened to escape via the tiny fissures in his skull.  Before he could even rationalize it to himself, he was on the way back from the party store.  This bag was to make up for dickfest;  to win back some self-esteem.  It would still be a cool thing to know how to do.

Jeremy came home to a zoo in his living room.  There were dogs of course, a poodle, a dachsund, and whatever breed that generic balloon dog design is suppose to be.  Bunnies, kitties, and monkeys: lions and tigers and bears.  There wasn't a free spot to sit anywhere in the living room.  Kai had filled every surface in the house with balloons.  He had passed out at the computer desk, his neck at an odd angle; an inflated, but untwisted balloon in his hand.  Jeremy fed the end of the balloon into Kai's open mouth.  It woke him immediately.  He bit down reflexively, and the balloon popped.

""Wakey, wakey Dr. Doolittle"" said Jeremy.

""Fuck you, asshole"" replied Kai.

Their bromance was on shaky ground, but Kai's obsession continued.  He skipped class the next day to learn more designs.  He'd breezed through all the single balloon animals and could make a half a dozen variations of swords, but he wanted to make cool stuff now.  Once he'd mastered the basic techniques, he got to the point where he could predict what the next move would be in the tutorial.  He even improved some of the designs by applying things he'd learned from prior videos.  He was fully enthralled with his hobby, even allowing himself to fantasize about how he could monetize this new passion for twisting and manipulating latex.  It was only when Jeremy left to get dinner with Rachel, that he realized that he hadn't eaten anything all day.  He hadn't had anything to drink either, not even coffee when he woke up.  He hadn't pissed since he'd woken up that morning either.  If you had told him a week ago that he would spend literally an entire calendar day doing nothing but making balloon animals, he'd have told you to go fuck yourself, but that is exactly what he had just done.

That night, Kai had the most vivid dream of his life.  People think that you can control a lucid dream, and with deliberate and concerted effort, it is possible.  But Kai had fallen ass-backward into one, so he was largely at its mercy.  He was at the circus party again, only now the entire backyard looked like it was the bounce house. It wasn't just the ground either.  The deck and all its furniture, the games they'd set up, even the keg;  everything was inflated.  There was even a balloon version of his bottle of Beefeater's with three tiny x's made out of deflated balloons, like it was a bottle of hooch in an old black and white cartoon.  ""The only thing missing are the girls,"" he thought, and as if summoned, he noticed there was a girl at the back of the yard.  She wasn't facing him, and as he drew closer, he sensed something was off.  She had an uncanny weightlessness to her silhouette.  She turned to face him, and he saw that she too was made of balloons, maybe hundreds of them, twisted into impossibly small bubbles and folds.  She wasn't just made out of balloons, it was like she was a living balloon.  She smiled and gestured for him to come closer with one tightly-inflated finger.  He played along, ""no worse than getting off with a blow-up doll;""  shameful, but no one had to know.  She lifted the array of balloons that made up her shirt exposing two perfectly spherical balloon breasts, capped with two tiny red balloons to represent nipples.  Kai stroked the contours of her cleavage before putting one of the balloons in his mouth.  Suddenly, the balloon popped, but instead of air, exploding forth from this latex facsimile of a woman came a torrent of blood and globs of fat and skin.  The girl was real now, but she laid dead on the ground, a gaping hole where her left breast should be.  Kai woke up after that, drenched in sweat, as if he had just broken a fever.

The dream should have been a wake-up call, but Kai was too far down the rabbit hole now.  He wasn't following tutorials anymore.  He'd had the house to himself for a week and he had graduated to larger, more intricate projects.  Jeremy had heard one pop too many and left to stay at Rachel's apartment until he had ""gotten it out of his system"".  He couldn't blame him for leaving though.  If he hadn't seen it himself, he may have even been able to get it out of his system;  ride it out until the next thing caught his interest.  But he had been there, that wonderland where it felt like the whole world was floating on air.  He'd just have to show him, and so he went about doing just that.  By the time Jeremy came back, Kai had replaced every piece of furniture in the living room with a painstakingly sculpted doppelganger.  It looked like the set of a children's show that never existed.

""You've lost your fuckin mind man, you know that""  said Jeremy when he arrived that Saturday.  ""You know, I really thought you'd be over this shit by now, but this...?  Did you just get rid of our couch?  Our tv?  Or do I get to help you put all that shit back now?""  ""FUCK!!  Man, all I wanted to do was chill, maybe binge watch a show with my girlfriend and you go and pull this shit?!""  Then, after taking a deep breath, he said ""Once they finish fumigation at her apartment, I'm moving in with Rachel.  After tonight, I'm done, maybe you can twist up a new roommate with those things, since that's all you seem to care about.""

That night, Kai had dreamt just that.  He was making Jeremy out of balloons, but he had to do it from the inside out.  He had started with white for the skeleton, then various shades of blush and pink for the organs, red for the heart.  He was almost done with the legs when he realized he needed to give it a penis.  Contemplating the exact dimensions of his best friend's sexual organs was almost enough to cause him to wake up.  But before he could make a decision one way or the other, he was overcome with dread, as if he had been watched for some time and was just then becoming aware of it.  He turned around to see a colossal man made out of innumerable balloons, a gargantuan golem of rubber and air.  Impossibly huge, easily fifty times the size of Kai.  It stooped to face him, his taut features an eternal grimace of pure hate.  It scooped up Kai in one enormous, translucent fist and with the other hand, started to stretch Kai out from wrist to ankle.  It then blew a torrent of air into Kai's mouth, first to no effect, but soon his skin began to swell and separate from the flesh and fascia of his body.  It then began twisting, manipulating, and rearranging the various parts of Kai's body until it had achieved that classic balloon dog silhouette.  The god of balloons looked quizzically at his handiwork, then, as if struck by epiphany, he picked up his body once more.  He gripped Kai's genitals tightly, stretched them to an impossible length, and with a pop, broke them off and tied off the remaining tissue.  He set Kai's body down admiringly and walked into the horizon, content with his handiwork.

When the police came to do a wellness check three days later, nothing could have prepared them for what they walked into.  When they got the door open, a wave of balloons came spewing out.  You couldn’t take one step without causing half a dozen balloons or more to go tumbling.  They had all leaked a lot of air and would unravel and pop at odd intervals.  Everyone had jokes until they got to the master bedroom.  It was Jeremy and Rachel, though it would take a DNA test to prove it.  Their bodies were unrecognizable, but that does not truly do justice to what those officers bore witness to.  They had been twisted together at the waist, their legs facing away from each other at right angles such that even in death, they stood upright.  Their arms had been bent 120 degrees in the opposite direction, hand's torn off and posed in such a way as to evoke the forelimbs of a praying mantis.  It was hard to believe their eyes, and still harder to imagine someone being capable of doing such a thing.  However, it was the heads that had been altogether impossible to comprehend.  Somehow, their necks had been elongated to such a degree, that they could be twisted together five full revolutions with enough slack to droop down as if they had just nodded off.  At a glance they resembled two large eyeballs on the end of stalks.  It looked like a creature from another dimension, or what an orgy might look like on DMT.

They called it a jealousy-induced double murder/suicide.  It was an easy answer and they could use it as ammunition in the war on drugs.  Here's some aspie weirdo with a thing for balloons that somehow linked up with the big man on campus.  You know how it goes with roommates, after a while, every little noise they make is like a personal attack.  So one day Bozo was in his bedroom, stroking his balloons when he heard the rhythmic thump of his roommate's headboard smacking against the wall.  He decided enough is enough, and snorted a fistful of pcp and incel rage;  kicked down his roommate's door and turned them into a monster, a flesh golem, human sculpture.  Then he went back to his bed and went to work on himself.  Only a dusthead or an insane man could have done it.  The coroner confirmed the cause of death was loss of blood, but the manner was a first of its kind.  Kai had bunched up his penis and testicles into a bundle, stretched it well beyond what any man would think possible, and inverted them over and over again, until he had twisted the whole package nine full revolutions.  He then pulled with inhuman strength, popping it off like a piece of excess balloon.  The doctor had never seen anything like it in thirty years of practice.  The police told people that Kai had snapped, but that was wrong.  Kai had not snapped.   He had popped.",1,1754784345.0,scarystories,0,1.0,True

     I bought the game at a thrift store, along with Vice City, Shadow of the Collossus, and what I thought was Star Wars: knights of the old republic, but what was actually a SpongeBob dvd.  I thought it would be cool.  I’d played other wrestling games from the ps2 era and remembered liking them when I was a teenager.  

     When I went to check out, the clerk had a shit eating grin.  His “mystery game”, he’d called it.  Said it just showed up outside the store one day.  Wherever it came from, he seemed happy to be rid of it.  I asked if there was anything wrong with it.  

     “Who knows? For $2, does it really matter?”

     I’d pay him $1000 to have kept it now.  A million if I had it.  I’d give anything to go back to before I picked up that copy of WCW Mayhem.  
     My wife had taken our son to visit her sister who lived about an hour and a half away.  They’d be spending the night, so I had the house to myself.  After dinner, frozen pizza and a C4.  I loaded the game into my PS2.  It turns out it was a ps1 game and I hadn’t noticed, but it was backwards compatible so it still played.  As I scrolled through the wrestlers, the nostalgia washed over me.  There were the wrestlers I remembered from the time like the NWO, Sting, and Goldberg.  Some guys I hadn’t thought about in 20 years.  Raven, Kanyon, Kidman; I’d forgotten the Flock even existed.

     Then I got to the Horsemen.  You had to unlock Ric Flair, but that wasn’t the jarring part.  Staring at me from inside the screen was the face of a cold-blooded killer.  Chris Benoit.  The Canadian Crippler.  The startup screen had said 1999, of course he’d be in it.  If this was a new game, that’d be a different story.  But in 1999, he was a rising superstar.  

     I decided to play as him.  I know it’s a dark choice, but I liked him as a kid.  And what he would go on to do notwithstanding, he was an amazing technician.  The developers must’ve thought so too, because I was kicking ass.  It felt like easy mode.  I’d do a couple moves throw in a taunt and my special move would be ready.  I hit it, the crippler crossface, classic, only it didn’t quite look right.  Maybe it was the limitations of the graphics of the time, or maybe because I was playing on a modern tv.  It looked like he was twisting his opponent’s neck past the point where it would break.  Then, instead of the usual tap out animation, the opponent just went limp and fell face first into the mat.  During the cut scene where the winner usually raised his arms triumphantly, he just stood there with his head down and his shoulders bobbing up and down.  It cut to a closeup and I could see that he was weeping.  He put his hands over his face and the game froze.  

     That was weird.  Old games like this freeze up all the time, but was that reallly his victory animation?  And what was up with that finisher?  It looked like he broke his neck, and had there been a crack?  It was in the background, but I swear I heard a crack.  I turned the game back on, but this time it loaded straight into a match.  I was playing as Benoit, but instead of the opponent from the last match, Scott Norton, it was Nancy.    

     This was fucked up.  I didn’t even know she was in this game.  Maybe she was one of the unlockable characters?  But I had never played this game.  This was a new memory card, mint in box.  I was the first owner.  I paused the game.  It was just a game after all.  But I was still hesitant.  Just the knowledge of what he would go on to do to her, and that little boy.  I couldn’t imagine what it would take to do something like that.   

     I was about to eject it and just play something else when the game unpaused itself.  The controller was on the coffee table; I was nowhere near it.  Then the characters started wrestling on their own, only they weren’t really wrestling.  He was beating the shit out of her.  Were the animations different when it was male versus female?  I had never seen these moves, they looked meaner and they left a mark on her character model.  Nancy had a black eye and slumped motionless in the rear turnbuckle.  Benoit retrieved a steel chair from under the ring.  He moved to Nancy, but instead of hitting her with it, he partially unfolded it and placed it over her head so that the seat covered her face.  He sprinted across the ring and springboarded back at her, drop kicking the chair.  

     This time the crack was louder.  I know what I heard.  Nancy fell to the mat.  It didn’t even say the match was over, but it went to the victory cutscene.  His head slumped and his shoulders bobbed up and down as if he was crying again.  However, when it cut to the closeup, I wasn’t ready for what was on my television screen.  There stood Chris Benoit, not the pixels on flat planes art of the rest of the game, but a hyper realistic rendition.  It looked like archival footage, I could see his veins, his sweat.  He was crying, but I could see in this hyper-realistic state that he was also smiling.  Laughing like a maniac while tears poured down his face.  

     Fuck this game.  I popped it out and put in Shadow of the Collosus.  I went to the kitchen and made white people nachos in the air fryer.  When I came back to the living room though my heart sank.  I dropped the damn nachos, because what was on my screen was impossible.  WCW Mayhem was loading.  I checked the case for Shadow of the Colossus.  Empty.  Before I had a chance to even think of how this was possible, I saw the ring.  In the center was Chris Benoit as he had originally appeared in the game.  Instead of an opponent, there was what looked like a machine.  A piece of exercise equipment, specifically a lat pulldown machine.  I watched in horror as the character model approached it and in that crude, 90’s video game animation, wrapped the cable around his neck.  He then looked at the camera.  No, looked at me, and dragged his thumb across his throat, his signature taunt.  He pulled the pin holding the weight up, the cable tightened and his neck broke.  The screen faded to black, but only for a moment.  When it came back on, it wasn’t the game, it was Chris Benoit himself.  It was how he must’ve been when the police found him, but it wasn’t a crime scene photo.  No, this did not exist, could not exist.  It was like my tv was a window, and on the other side was his corpse.  

     After that, I broke the disc into splinters and collected them in a bag.  I burned the bag in my backyard, but I don’t think this is over.  I wish I could be more optimistic.  If I was a single man it might be different.  But I have a wife and son that I love with every fiber of my being.  I know that no power on earth could compel me to harm them.  By all accounts, Chris Benoit loved his family, but he took too many blows to the head and lost control.  Cte is the most common theory for his crimes.  Brain damage had made him a shell of his former self.  An avatar, like someone else is controlling your body.  Like a character in a video game.

     I love my wife and son, but I’m afraid.  I could never explain to her what happened with the game.  She wouldn’t believe me anyway, think it was my idea of a sick joke.  But what I really can’t explain is how a lat pulldown machine got into our living room.

I came home and texted her to ask where she was and the phone buzzed. So I walked to where I heard it in the kitchen. There was a WhatsApp message from me and some guy saved as “Antonio B.” asking what she’s doing tonight. 

I should’ve checked his number right then but I didn’t. Mostly because I didn’t want her to see that the message was already read. 

I put the phone down and waited. 

She got home a bit later and I said, “Antonio wants to know what you’re up to tonight.” She went pale. Then she went on a tirade about my having read her messages (last DDay that’s exactly how I caught her).

Long story short: She’s admitted she has been chatting online with “Antonio” since BEFORE I caught her sexting with her ex in June. She even met with him for coffee last week!!!! She told me he has no idea I exist. She said they’ve just been talking for months and that’s all. That he travels for work. I demanded to know where they met. She wouldn’t say. 

I took our son to bed and when I came back she had her phone and was trying to wipe it. She deleted his contact and the chat in WhatsApp. I managed to get the phone and deleted and reinstalled the app but she had turned off iCloud backup. She also tried to lock me out of the phone but I managed to get back in. 

It’s 2am here. I’ve got basically five hours to try to uncover this guy’s number. 

I have his WhatsApp profile pic and his name as it came up in her contacts. 

Can anyone help? I’ve tried her call log but to no avail.

so i’m kinda stuck. i don’t know if i should do a couch and a loveseat? but i’m not sure what size couch would even work best :( i don’t necessarily wanna put any seating in the bottom right corner because there wouldn’t be a view to the tv from there due to the size of the living room. i have a coffee table that’s about 2.5ft long that i need to incorporate into the space as well. the whole apt is about 750sqft.

So, from the moment I met my ex, she used to invite me over to eat cake with her and her friends. Some time later, we had a video call, but she never wanted to show her face, saying her hair was messy. Eventually, she told me she had autism.

Our conversations were often one sided. We planned to meet at the park, but she canceled, saying she had hurt her leg. She once told me I was treating her differently after knowing she was autistic. She shared that her ex had abandoned her, and that she’d been seeing another guy who left her for someone else.

One day, I got mugged and almost lost her number. Strangely, she didn’t seem to care much and even said she wouldn’t message me unless I messaged first. She told me about her cats and how her nephews also had autism. She once got very mad when her cousin mentioned she drank with her ex.

Later, I invited her to the movies because she said we never went out. At first, she refused out of embarrassment, but after I insisted, she agreed then the next day she asked if we should just be friends. We ended up going anyway, bought snacks, kissed during the movie, and spent the afternoon being romantic. She never let me see her phone and didn’t give me her Instagram until after we broke up.

Another time, we went to the mall, she gave me chocolate, and we ended up going to a motel. There, she said she was embarrassed and didn’t want the lights on. I said it was fine, but she quickly got reactive and her mood changed. Another day, after some flirting at the park, I walked her home, but she made it clear she didn’t want me meeting her family.

There was a day her sister drove her to my place, and I joked that we didn’t go out much because she was always making excuses. She got really mad. Another time, we played a game together, I criticized it, and she got upset and stopped playing. She gave me chocolate, we hung out, and then she suddenly suggested breaking up.

She invited me to a party with her, but kept changing her mind about whether I should go. I asked if she didn’t want me there. Eventually, I decided to show up earlier than she told me to, and her sister saw me and took me inside. We ended up at her friend’s party, where she introduced me as her boyfriend. Then, out of nowhere, she said, “Should we download an app to find you a hot girl?”

After that, we went to her place, she wanted me to stay the night, but I went home. With all these ups and downs, I finally called her and ended things. She cried and blocked me. Later, she said I’d sent her to therapy (CAPS) and ruined her happiness. Soon after, she messaged saying she missed me more than she expected, and we started talking again.

While chatting, I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she said she was looking for her friend’s ex. I got upset, but later told her I loved her. She said she wished I had been somewhere she went recently. Then she called, inviting me to her mom’s birthday. I didn’t go. Her mom called asking if I loved her, then invited me over for coffee.

We spoke again, but she told me her dad was mad at me. I got upset and vented online. She found out and accused me of using and deceiving her, saying she only acted that way because she was insecure and autistic, that she prayed for me every day… and then she blocked me for good.


TL;DR:
Got into a rollercoaster relationship with a girl who said she had autism, constantly sent mixed signals, blocked and unblocked me multiple times, refused to introduce me to her family (then suddenly did), suggested we find “a hot girl” for me, accused me of ruining her happiness, and finally vanished after blaming everything on insecurity and autism.

Sobering up requires you to not only get out of the hole you placed yourself in, but to also fill that hole with something else. More liquor? Been there, done that. How about drugs? Too hardcore. Sex and rock and roll? Not charming enough. No I needed something else, I wasn't an artist, nor creative and I hadn't written anything in ages. Next stop was back to the bottle, until Buddy came into my life. 

I got him when he was just a pup. Sorry, I should say that he came to me when he was a pup. Just like something out of a fairytale. Like an angel falling from the heavens. A baby with its stork. I had finished the last drop of Absolut in my apartment on the 3rd floor, and then there was the knock. Stumbling from my couch (which I had been planted in for most of the morning) I opened the door to see a small dog sitting patiently on my door step. The carpet enveloping the dog was a cheesy yellow stained by unknown substances. Likely spills from my late nights.

“Where did you come from boy?” I rubbed his long flappy ears clumsily, they felt so delicate and soft on my fingers, like satin. Craning my neck around his drooped chocolate eyes, I came to the conclusion that it must have been a stray. No tag, no collar, nothing. So when I brought the dog inside, I made the place his home. Instantly, it curled up right next to me on the couch, contorting the couch to an odd angle.

“Hey you're a smart one aren't you?” I whispered to him.

The front door swung open presenting my roommate. He was a scrawny lad only a few years younger than me. He had that classic roommate look on his face, you know the one. The one of disgust mixed with prolonged disappointment. He swung his jaw about at the state of the place.

“Dude this place is a pig sty, im gone for a few days and-” he paused, taking in the mound of fur that poked his head out over my lap. ""Is that a dog?”

“Yeah he's so friendly right? I think I'll keep him.”

“You sure as shit aint it's my house too! Clean yourself up man, I'm not living in a flat with a drunk and a dog the size of a bear!”

I was still pretty wasted at this point so I can't recall the incessant arguing that followed but I can certainly remember the end. At the peak of the bickering came a low howl. A melodic unwavering tone emanated from the dog, immediately halting us in our argument.

After that he stayed. A member of the family. He was our Buddy.

When I say our Buddy, I mean my Buddy not his. He never took care of him, it was all me and I loved him so much. I took him everywhere, however it was difficult to hide that large frame from my landlord, thank God he was deaf which made things easier. Buddy was so smart, I could teach him all kinds of tricks. He could play dead, roll over, he could even speak. I don't mean that he could just bark on command. *He could actually talk.* I'd understand if you don't believe me but it's true. You can teach dogs anything with enough time on your hands and the right methods. So I'd take time off my shitty office job to the point of unemployment to reach my goal, to get him to talk. Here's what I did, I placed his mat under the fridge and opened the door. Not only does this cool the brain down (this helps with cognitive functions for males) but it also provides a warm light (which promotes focus). I know it sounds silly but I provided Buddy with a small speaker which played small melancholic tunes mixed with the audiobook for the Oxford English dictionary.

Every night for 3 years I would continue to repeat this process, I could pay for the extra electric costs and to hell with what my roommate thought, I told him my therapist said it helps me ‘relax past traumas and help recover addictions and all that to try and get him off my ass. All bullshit. Then, on the 16th of August 2003 it finally paid off. Buddy spoke.

It was late at night, the steel blue glow of the tv played some fishing show, while Buddy was deep in his corner in the kitchen. My head was rolled to the side, an empty shot glass was sliding back and forth between my pinky finger and thumb. I was at my lowest point, the bottom of the barrel. Years of my life wasted over some stupid hypothesis. I was about to pour another glass when I swear I could've heard something emanating from the kitchen. *What was that? I heard something, what was it?* Coming out of fatigue on the couch, I heard from the corner of the kitchen the sound of a whine, a howl and a groan. It went something like “Reeehn ooohhh Rooooayyyy.” I immediately pulled the tv cord out from the wall causing the marlin on screen to snap to black and I slid over the tiled floor on my hands and knees, keeping that deafening silence. I was begging him to speak, anything at all. I was in a river of silence, drowning indefinitely, drowning forever until my lungs ruptured and my eyes bulged. I was red in the face. Anything please God anything.

There it was again!

It was deeper, softer this time with every syllable becoming more articulate. I turned, grabbing my notepad on top of the counter and returned to see the giant dog sitting upright, staring with its dark chocolate eyes, mouth agape. Silence…

*‘Kiiiiirrrlll Yore Rooomayye,”* said Buddy, in a low guttural groan. It sounded like an old door slowly opening. Or the rocking of a piece of furniture under strain. Groaning.

I was shocked, now I craved the silence. I didn't want to hear anymore. Something about that tone. He didn't just say that, did he? No it isn't true he didn't say what I think he said he said “Krill is Yummy,” no thats silly he said “Fill your tummy,” some gibberish it had to be. *Stupid stupid dont be stupid you know what he just said.* I was an inch away from him now. His hot breath seeped into my pores sticking to my skin, dribbles of drool swung as he slowly breathed in and out, in and out. He wasn't panting anymore, he was breathing with conformity, and he stared deep into my eyes, His eyes narrowing, his head turned down slightly and we were both eye level now with his teeth. His fangs, sharp and huge. I saw something in his eyes, those eyes weren't chocolate coloured anymore, no they were that of coal, a deep void, dark and endless, derived from something that wasn't to be seen on earth. I needed to get away right then and there. I began to slowly crawl backwards when Buddy spoke those words I dreaded to hear.

*“Kill Your Roommate.""*



Finally my work paid off, there was an ingredient that I have been missing to this whole experiment. Liquor. That night was my relapse night, I sure as shit wasn't proud of it but results are results. Obviously he lacked the articulation to pronounce anything more noteworthy than a bark that's impossible. No he wasn't the one who changed I was, I could truly hear him now, I could be his messenger. I've finally found my purpose.

Following Buddy's words he immediately fell back into a brutish form of speech, completely unintelligible. Barks and whimpers and howls returned once more. So as the scientist I thought I was, I quickly came to the conclusion that I needed more liquor as that was the one changing variable in all of this. Besides, after what I heard I clearly needed it. Stumbling back to the couch I picked up my near empty bottle of Jack and finished the whole thing. I wasn't relapsing no, this was a mere experiment. I'm just visiting this time I promise. Before long, I was back into a state of bliss. Crawling back next to Buddy I scrambled to pick up the fallen notebook and attempted to write down the dog’s messages.

“I am a being beyond your understanding, I speak in tongues you cannot perceive. In the heavens and below, I am the snake. The harbinger of the end.”

Buddy then stooped his head down and licked the palm of my open hand.

“Upon this rock will I build my church. If you carry this burden I will make you a king of kings. Gold, Frankincense and myrrh will flow from your hands like waterfalls and you will be that of lordship over your gaze. All that I ask of you is to bow, for me to be your master and when dust settles, you will be a great favourite among my lands.""

The liquor made me laugh, it is very hard to take a talking dog seriously with so much in your system. I slumped back into the cabinet adjacent to me, trying to keep my gaze on the mass of fur. A long while flew past as I just stared at the mass, lolling my head side to side, trying not to throw up.

“You're uhhhh,” I chuckled, ""you're a very very bad dog aren't you.”

Buddy raised himself, standing on all fours now. I remember his paws so vividly, they looked as if you curled your fist into a ball and placed it flat onto the floor.

“During the miracle of the swine, did those demons become pigs? Or did they remain demons?”

“Buddy you're a dog. I mean like you have paws and stuff. You're not a pig!”

Interrupting our pleasant drunken conversation came my roommate. Poking his head around the corner, giving that same stupid look.

“For the love of God please shut that dog up, it's 3 in the morning and I have work.” He peered down at the empty bottle of Jack beside me. “Dude you relapsed?! My God you are a mess, clean yourself up and I swear,” I hated when he pointed that finger at me, “If you have another drop of anything but water I will tell Gary about you and your mutt, I'm serious this time I will NOT stand for this shit anymore!” Buddy was back to his resting position, staring straight at me, not even noticing my roommate's outburst.

I began to chuckle once more, I couldn't help myself. “What kind of name is Gary? Who even is Gary?”

“He's our landlord my lord- okay im going to bed just please keep it down, we're gonna have to sort this shit out in the morning.” With that he left the kitchen, leaving me with the dog.

“You need to kill him, kill your roommate.""

“Yea yea you've said, I wouldn't be too opposed to it I mean the guys a dick.” I joked. Getting up from the floor, I hobbled back to the tv. Plugging the wire back into its socket I got back to my fishing show. I know it sounds silly but drunk me needed that breather. Not only am I being told what to do by my roommate but I'm also being told what to do by my dog. By Buddy, by whatever is in my kitchen staring at me. 

“Kill him, do it, kill your roommate.” Buddy still didn't move from his post, he stayed watch over me as I tried to ignore him. “Kill your roommate. You must kill your roommate.” This went on for about an hour as I tried to unwind, trying to ignore him. After hearing ‘kill your roommate’ for the 52nd time, I was fed up, turning the tv off (with the remote this time) I turned to Buddy.

“Why won't you just shut up? I'll send you to the pound, don't make me do that.”

“Kill your roommate.”

“On a serious point I can't do it Buddy, why do you want him dead anyway?” 

“Kill your roommate, it will be the key to unlocking your true desires. Upoooonnnn thiiiss roooaahh ROUGH ROUGH ROUGH!”

I groaned. *God I'm sober now*, and with no money to buy another drop, I'm stuck with a howling mutt. I can't believe it, I actually have to go get some cash to pay for more liquor. I sure as shit can't take another loan from my roommate. What would I tell him? *Sorry roomie, I'll pay you back, I know I already owe you for last month's rent. I just need to talk to my dog real quick about killing you.* Work it is then, ill find a job and ill get to continue my talks with Buddy. I heard the lights flick on in my roommates room. A muffled voice shot to the kitchen.

“Will you shut that damn dog up!”



It's hard to go through withdrawal symptoms, it's even harder finding a job under withdrawal symptoms. Not only is the job market buggered right now, but with my credentials it was near impossible finding a job that was worth anything above minimum wage. Buddy was my burden, I needed to care for him but he scared the shit out of me. I was a mess walking around in public, giving a nervous glance to every dog walking down the street. Could they talk too? How about if I give my roommate liquor, could he hear dogs? Buddy became my life, I needed to uncover his secrets. 

Shit out of luck, I was standing on the corner of my block leaning on a post. Putting my hand in my pocket I felt around for anything. *A five dollar note and a 50 cent coin, great.* The block was near empty except for the odd homeless guy planted on their usual spots. Store wise there was a cafe, some second hand stores and a grocery store in between two bars. Quite the miserable sight. So I went up the street into the cafe to think of my predicament. 

Spending my last 5 dollar note, I sat down to wait for my coffee. *I heard online that if you hold your breath for 1 minute, breath for 30 seconds and repeat that process, you can achieve something similar to being wasted. I'd need to try that later-*

“Excuse me, sir?” Pulled out of my thoughts, I looked up to see a waitress hand me my coffee. 

“Oh thanks. Hey, I was wondering if I could get a job here, do you need any work done around the place?”

She gave a flat faced look, a strand of her hair escaped her bun, lying on her apathetic frown. I immediately knew I wasn't getting the job.

I got up and began to walk out of the place, “It's alright dont worry about it nevermind.”

“Wait sir, we're not hiring right now. I'm sorry, but my friend might have a job for you.”

Turning around I returned to her, I was startled by my own pace. “ What have you got? For my expenses I need a job that is above minimum wage but not by much! I'll do anything.”

She was visibly taken back by my outburst.

“Sir… Do you like dogs?”

I rubbed my face, wiping my disappointment off in a clean swipe, “I can deal with dogs, I'm actually taking care of one now.” I sighed reluctantly.

“Well my friend runs a pound a couple blocks over, If you want I can get his number for you? Put in a good word?” She then bent over, scribbling the name, address and number of the place onto a napkin before handing it to me.

“You're a lifesaver, thank you so much.”

I left that store a different man. The sun was brighter, the humidity was warmer and people were smiling. What a day. I didn't even care that I had to walk an hour a day to my new potential job. Even though I had to deal with more dogs, I came up around to the dog issue. Potential experiments were endless.

Making my way there was quite the mission. Not a wonder in the world why I miss this shop everytime I pass by here. My local pound was placed in between two long brick buildings, it looked like the letter H. It opened up slightly when you walked into the glorified alleyway, a rusty gate to the left with a dilapidated building in the middle. At the top of the building lay a deflated inflatable weiner dog, its head flopped over the front roof, a strangled neck, barely keeping the head from falling off.

Swinging the door open came the sound of a ring and a choir of barking dogs. A symphony of muffled barks and howls echoed around the waiting room and the front desk. The sound was emanating from behind the desk in a long corridor, sealed by a wooden door. Behind the front desk sat a large man with a rotund frame.

“Hi, do you work here?”

The man folded his arms, they looked like tree trunks. “Work here? I own this place, how can I help you?”

“I was looking for a job sir.”

“A job? What's your credentials?”

“Dropped out of highschool, I worked at a corporate building for a while, I was the paperboy.” His brow stayed in a stern manner, clearly unimpressed. “I like dogs, I have a dog.” An uncomfortable silence followed this. The Man still had his arms folded, I could see a small patch of mustard in his moustache.

“Well son, are you fine with cleaning up dog shit? Are you fine with putting dogs down? What about handling potentially dangerous animals, with rabies and all of that.”

“Sir please, I'm desperate, I'll do anything.” 

“Show me any form of registration.”

I handed him my old highschool ID from a few years prior, I didn't have a drivers license just yet so that ID was all I really had at the time.

“You're hired, we can do the paperwork later.”

“Great! When can I start?”

“Right now son, I need an extra pair of hands today” He got up grabbing a key from his key ring to the holding room.

“Got some mess you need to clean.”

I had no clue what they fed those dogs and I did not want to find out. The shift was long and tedious but pay was pay. I hated my apartment door late at night, the loud whining and squealing of the hinges would always wake up half the building. Before I could close the door, my roommate stormed out of his room and gave me his classic friendly welcome home.

“Let me smell your breath.”

“No I'm not doing any of that shit anymore I promise.” Buddy was no longer in his usual spot under the fridge, I had no clue where he was.

“Well then why have you been out so long huh? I care about you man, you can't be treating your body this way.”

“I told you I wasn't doing anything of that kind.” I closed the door behind me, “I got a job.”

“A job?” He looked like he was looking for the definition before returning to me in a friendly gaze. “Oh man, that's actually really cool. I'm sorry, where's your work?” 

“At the pound, let me tell you it's not a pretty job.”

“Work is work man, hey maybe next time you go there you can take Buddy with you, he's been weird as shit recently.”

“Besides constantly avoiding you?”

“No no I've gotten used to that,” he wiped his jaw downwards, “yea no its weird ill just show you.”

My roommate led me into my bedroom where Buddy was. He was seated up right a few feet away from my small bookshelf. 

“Yea he's been doing that ever since you left, he hasn't even eaten anything. His eyes have just been darting up and down each book. It's weird.”

“Buddy?” I walked up to the dog's large frame, he was so still. “You alright Buddy?” Peering closer I realised that the dog was dead still, he lacked the animation of breathing. Just a slight turn of his head and eyes peering at each book was the slightest clue to tell us that he wasn't a statue. He looked like a puppet. Shaking the dog did nothing, he was stationary. His folds rippled at the shake of my hands and yet I couldn't move his large frame. I grabbed a blanket from my bed and flung it over the shelf. Buddy immediately stood on his fours and walked out of the room, nudging my roommate out of the way causing him to stumble. Following him out of the room, we saw him seated at the base of the kitchen, staring up into the top shelf. This time he was looking at an edmonds cookbook.

“Okay Buddy, it's late, time for bed.” I said, nervously shifting the book to the back of the shelf. Buddy made many rounds around the apartment after that, analysing each room he went into. Meanwhile, my roommate and I would attempt to hide every book Buddy laid eyes upon. Finally, when there were no books in sight, the dog went to rest. There was no more stomping, no scrambling around the place, nothing. I walked back into my room to rest (I had a big shift the next day). When I took a look at the bookshelf, I was surprised to find that I must've missed the bottom shelf as there was a solitary book sitting in the corner. I'm surprised it was there in the first place as I hadn't seen it in months. There it was, standing upright with an imprint of a golden colour. Completely observable to the naked eye was a King James Bible.

1mm42jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1mm42jf/aio_by_getting_into_the_most_confusing_hot_and/,"AIO by getting into the most confusing, hot and cold relationship of my life with a girl who kept me at arm’s length but still called me her boyfriend?","She gave me a chocolate and hours later ""isn't it better to part ways?""
So, from the moment I met my ex, she used to invite me over to eat cake with her and her friends. Some time later, we had a video call, but she never wanted to show her face, saying her hair was messy. Eventually, she told me she had autism.

Our conversations were often one sided. We planned to meet at the park, but she canceled, saying she had hurt her leg. She once told me I was treating her differently after knowing she was autistic. She shared that her ex had abandoned her, and that she’d been seeing another guy who left her for someone else.

One day, I got mugged and almost lost her number. Strangely, she didn’t seem to care much and even said she wouldn’t message me unless I messaged first. She told me about her cats and how her nephews also had autism. She once got very mad when her cousin mentioned she drank with her ex.

Later, I invited her to the movies because she said we never went out. At first, she refused out of embarrassment, but after I insisted, she agreed then the next day she asked if we should just be friends. We ended up going anyway, bought snacks, kissed during the movie, and spent the afternoon being romantic. She never let me see her phone and didn’t give me her Instagram until after we broke up.

Another time, we went to the mall, she gave me chocolate, and we ended up going to a motel. There, she said she was embarrassed and didn’t want the lights on. I said it was fine, but she quickly got reactive and her mood changed. Another day, after some flirting at the park, I walked her home, but she made it clear she didn’t want me meeting her family.

There was a day her sister drove her to my place, and I joked that we didn’t go out much because she was always making excuses. She got really mad. Another time, we played a game together, I criticized it, and she got upset and stopped playing. She gave me chocolate, we hung out, and then she suddenly suggested breaking up.

She invited me to a party with her, but kept changing her mind about whether I should go. I asked if she didn’t want me there. Eventually, I decided to show up earlier than she told me to, and her sister saw me and took me inside. We ended up at her friend’s party, where she introduced me as her boyfriend. Then, out of nowhere, she said, “Should we download an app to find you a hot girl?”

After that, we went to her place, she wanted me to stay the night, but I went home. With all these ups and downs, I finally called her and ended things. She cried and blocked me. Later, she said I’d sent her to therapy (CAPS) and ruined her happiness. Soon after, she messaged saying she missed me more than she expected, and we started talking again.

While chatting, I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she said she was looking for her friend’s ex. I got upset, but later told her I loved her. She said she wished I had been somewhere she went recently. Then she called, inviting me to her mom’s birthday. I didn’t go. Her mom called asking if I loved her, then invited me over for coffee.

We spoke again, but she told me her dad was mad at me. I got upset and vented online. She found out and accused me of using and deceiving her, saying she only acted that way because she was insecure and autistic, that she prayed for me every day… and then she blocked me for good.


TL;DR:
Got into a rollercoaster relationship with a girl who said she had autism, constantly sent mixed signals, blocked and unblocked me multiple times, refused to introduce me to her family (then suddenly did), suggested we find “a hot girl” for me, accused me of ruining her happiness, and finally vanished after blaming everything on insecurity and autism.

1mm40mz,https://i.redd.it/rch9u5pz03if1.jpeg,How much should I have expected to pay for these drinks?,"I was in Chicago last weekend for Lollapalooza. We went to a fairly well known bar in the Loop for some evening drinks. Their drink menu listed draft beer for $8 and cocktails (old fashioneds, martinis, manhattans, etc) for $16. I would say the bar was about half full and the bartenders were charming, welcoming, and talkative while they made up espresso martinis and old fashioneds for other patrons. I wanted to keep my order simple so I ordered a 7 & 7 for a first round followed by a couple Jameson and ginger ales thinking this would be a cheaper option. When I cashed out each drink was $12 so $36 total for all three drinks. My questions are:
1. Given the price of the other beverages, is $12 for a 7&7 reasonable?
2. If I just would have said whiskey 7up and/or whiskey ginger ale would the price have been cheaper (assuming I would have been poured Seagrams 7)?",0,1754783739.0,bartenders,16,0.32,False

I had a boyfriend (Trans male 21) who I met during my sophomore year of highschool. He is openly poly. He has expressed this and goes on dates with other people, usually with my consent, i let him ramble to me about how horrible and or great it was. So we're in my apartment one day, and he has to head home, his sister just threw up and his parents were on a date night. I didnt hear from him for a week. I was scared he went to the hospital again. He has a history of mental illness. He showed up my apartment with his sister, 13, who we'll call K. So K tells me my bfs car broke down and it just got repaired. I asked why that stopped my bf from calling. K, in the most monotone voice a 13 year old can muster, answers ""He was talking to his new boyfriend."" Assuming i knew. Spoiler alert:I didnt. So i sat next to him on the couch, asking about it, and he puts his headphones in. I take his headphones off and lean onto his shoulder, saying his name, he yelled at me ""WHAT"". So me, being every bit the emotional teen i am, starts to cry. He ignores me, his sister comforts me, saying shes sorry.  And im pissed that she feels bad about something her brother did. I asked why he didnt tell me. He finally answers me, and blames it on his autism. Autism doesnt stop you from sending a text like :""Hey, i met this cute guy, can i talk to him"" Because, from my understanding, polyamory or wtvr is usualy with both parties consent. And he calls me controlling because i said ""Why didnt you ask?"" so i asked to meet up for coffee a few days later, told him i couldnt handle all the lying anymore, and left him. So now all my friends are coming after me ""Youre being too hard on him"" and hes telling everyone \*\*I\*\* cheated. And im controlling. Im controlling?

Looking for someone to build a genuine connection with someone from Iowa or not too far away. Looking for someone that has at least some common interest but different enough to it's not like dating yourself. I prefer to build a friendship first and see where things go, I'm very old school when it comes to this. 

Appearance wise I'm about 1/2 an inch over 6ft. About average build, stay very active through out the year. Brown hair, blue eyes, glasses, never been considered ugly by my friends but definitely not a 10.

Interest and hobby wise, I'm and avid lover of anything outdoors, stuff like camping, fishing, backpacking, golf, hiking, etc As much as I love being out and about love just relaxing on the couch binging another tv show or movie. Also don't mind a good book every now and then, but that's more a winter hobby. Love taking time to appreciate the small things in like a rainy day, a good cup of coffee, a good craft beer. I work in tech so that can be stressful from time to time but brings in enough and their is plenty of time to enjoy the little things which is nice. I might work in a ""geeky"" career but I break quite a few of the normal stereotypes for someone that works in tech.

Maybe it was an interest post some time ago and I thought it would be more of that. Instead it’s posts about “is this all there is to life”?

Of course there’s an amount of shit baked into being an adult. Go to work, pay the bills, fulfil responsibilities. Unless you’re financially independent then that is how things go.

But the work you do is a choice. If you are unhappy with it then do something. Move, or study, or switch something up. Small changes or big changes. I don’t know. But if you chose to be an accountant and hate numbers then do something about it. The cost of living sucks, sure. Not everywhere is a HCOL area though. I saw a post in the simple living sub about a couple who did a mini-retirement for a while in a LCOL area. It can be done, but no one is coming to hold your hand through it all.

Bored? Put your phone down and start putting in the 10000 hours to master something. Invest in yourself. Be physically capable, and foster a brain that wants to learn.

Want to travel? See photos of exotic places and wish you could go? Stop buy coffees out or whatever and save that money to put towards a dream project.

I firmly believe people live the lives their choices have lead them to. My wife and I both grew up in public housing and are living our best lives now. Sure, it isn’t all sunshine and rainbows, but we’ve done some amazing things and have plans for more. We channel all of our resources (time, money, emotions) towards these shared goals. I’m under no illusions that life kicks asses and people are dealt shit hands at times. Definitely. But for the majority life can change and we can shape what we want it to be. Not in a private jet and penthouse apartments or whatever. But being able to make your own pizza dough, or run for an hour, or know how to do some skill that brings joy are choices. Sacrificing netflix and bought lunches and walking rather than driving if possible can open up money to do other things in life that will be far more memorable.

80% of the posts in this sub is complaining about things that can be changed if we look outside the box just a little. Give up our consumerist dreams, moderate our expectations, and funnel money away from crap we’re told will make us happy and towards things that actually align with our goals.

Maybe the question to the sub is what is something you’ve fostered in your life that took effort but has brought a lot of happiness?",7,1754783471.0,Adulting,1,1.0,False

1mm3v4n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mm3v4n,KVR update Rock Creek to Penticton,"I just completed the KVR from Rock Creek to Penticton. Here is an update.

You will need at minimum gravel tires and ideally sand tires. I used a narrow gravel tire and it was sufficient but I did have a couple of impassable sections of deeper sand that my tires could not handle.

The trail is in ok condition from Rock Creek to Beaverdell. It is generally a mix of gravel, rock, and sand. There are about a dozen cattle gates that need to be opened and closed. The traffic was quite light. We did not encounter many bikers. Beaverdell has a new hostel called Robin's Nest that was clean. The caretaker (Robin) is a nice guy. If you are camping there is a great spot at Wilkinson Creek about an hour past Beaverdell. Mom's burgers are cheap and good. Coffee at the gas station is very good. One note. When you approach Beaverdell you will hit a kiosk. To continue on the trail you have to take the road east for about 400 m towards the road into Beaverdell. The KVR turns north off the road at that point. The kiosk map did not match this.

Past Wilkinson Creek the trail continues to be a mix of gravel and rock. There is a significant detour due to a bridge repair about 3 km before Arlington Lakes. It may now be passable by bike but we did not find out. We took the detour. It is about 4 km of nasty FSRs and 100 m (!) elevation gain. We had to push a lot of it. It adds an hour to the trip. 

Arlington Lakes is a BC Parks campground, $15/night on government issue gravel campsites. If full there are overflow sites with better ground for tents. The water needs filtering. I'd recommend tablets and filter. It is not glacier or rain runoff so has high microbial count.

Arlington to Hydraulic was pretty flat and easy, as was Hydraulic to Mira Canyon parking lot. There are a few spots off the trail to camp in wilderness.

Mira Canyon is busy and very beautiful. The trail is excellent and lots of tourists visit there. After the West gate of Mira the trail goes back to being rocks and sand. It is more sandy here so you may find it more challenging. It was easier to pedal on the edges of the trail, as there was a fair bit of washboarding in the ruts from ATVs and 4x4s that share the trail.

The road into Chute Lake was pretty sandy. Chute Lake Resort has a nice restaurant. The trail from Chute Lake is rocky and sandy. About 3km south of Chute Lake the sand is very thick and difficult to navigate. The 180° tunnel is open to bike traffic. It has interior lighting and is kind of neat. The trail from this tunnel down to the parking lot is ok. The standard rocks and gravel and sand.

The trail from the parking lot into Penticton is excellent condition and busy with tourists.

The trail is still alright and was quite doable in 3 days if you aren't heavily encumbered and in decent shape. We averaged 40km/day but we could have done more quite easily if we pushed. It should be possible to average 16km/hr while moving for most sections, then it depends on how long your breaks are and the weather. We had dry trail (early August).",1,1754783284.0,KettleValleyRailTrail,0,1.0,False

**Purity and Additives:** A pure product results in maximum health benefits.

High-quality blue matcha should contain only pure butterfly pea flower powder, free from artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives. Check the ingredient list carefully to ensure that there are no hidden additives or fillers. Organic certification can provide further assurance of purity and adherence to strict quality standards.

**Antioxidant Content:** The reason many people choose blue matcha over other ingredients.

The antioxidant content, particularly anthocyanins, is a key factor in evaluating the quality of blue matcha.While specific antioxidant levels may not always be readily available, brands that prioritize sustainable sourcing and gentle processing are more likely to preserve these beneficial compounds.

The best chair side tables of 2025 are characterized by their blend of functionality, durability, and aesthetic appeal. Here are some of the key features to look for:

**Size and Dimensions:** The proper height and surface area are crucial for a chair side table. It should ideally be level with or slightly below the armrest of your chair to allow for easy access to items placed on it. Measure the height of your chair's armrests and choose a table that is a few inches shorter or the same height. Consider the surface area you need based on what you plan to place on the table.

A chair side table's dimensions are critical to its functionality and aesthetic integration within a room. A too-small table may not offer adequate surface area, while an oversized table can appear bulky and obstruct movement. The ideal height typically ranges from 24 to 30 inches, but should always align with the height of the adjacent seating’s armrest. the table’s footprint should also complement the scale of the room and seating area.

**Material and Construction:** Chair side tables are crafted from a wide range of materials, including wood, metal, glass, and plastic.Wood provides a classic and warm look, while metal offers a modern and industrial feel. Glass can create a sleek and minimalist effect, while plastic is a budget-pleasant and durable option. Consider the durability of the material and how well it will withstand daily use. Look for solid construction with sturdy legs and secure joints.

The choice of material and construction significantly impacts a chair side table’s longevity and style. Solid hardwood options, like oak or maple, are renowned for their durability and timeless aesthetic, although they can be pricier. Metal frames, especially those crafted from steel or aluminum, offer robust support and are suitable for contemporary designs. Composite materials, such as MDF or particleboard, can provide cost-effective solutions with a variety of finishes. Regardless of the material, attention to joint construction and surface finishing is crucial for long-term performance.

Drawers offer concealed storage for personal items, while open shelves are ideal for displaying books or decorative objects. Cabinets provide a more enclosed storage option,suitable for items that need to be protected from dust or view.

Traditional styles often feature ornate carvings, rich wood finishes, and classic silhouettes. Modern designs typically incorporate clean lines, minimalist details, and neutral color palettes. Contemporary styles may blend elements from both traditional and modern aesthetics, resulting in a unique and eclectic look. Selecting a table that complements the room’s architectural style, color scheme, and overall aesthetic is key to creating a cohesive and inviting space.

**Portability and Weight:** Consider how easily the table can be moved. Lighter tables are easier to reposition when needed,while heavier tables offer greater stability. If you anticipate moving the table frequently, choose a lightweight option.If you prioritize stability, opt for a heavier table.

The portability and weight of a chair side table are vital considerations, especially for those who frequently rearrange their furniture or require a table that can be easily moved for cleaning or other purposes. Lighter tables, typically made from materials like plastic, lightweight metal, or hollow-core wood, are easier to maneuver. Heavier tables, constructed from solid hardwood or with metal bases, offer enhanced stability and are less likely to tip over. Consider the trade-offs between portability and stability when making your choice.

1mm3swx,https://v.redd.it/oqd435z2z2if1,The Human Instrumentality Project,"Free will doesn't exist. Your brain has created models which are comprised of weighted nodes that form a bias. Those models determine how you interact with the world. Those models determine how electrical signals travel through your nervous system. Muscles contract. You reach for your coffee. That sequence of events was set in motion from the beginning at the Big Bang. You're not making choices, you're watching physics happen through a first-person viewport.



""But quantum mechanics makes it random.""

Being governed by dice rolls doesn't make you free. It just makes you unpredictable. You're still not steering. I'd rather be a gear in a deterministic machine than just some random swerving, but that seems to be what we are. Either way, you're not in control. The dice rolls aren't even being thrown by you.



We are the result of our DNA and the five senses we've had since birth, which have been our only input of the environment around us. Those inputs have been feeding information into our brains continuously, shaping the neural models that govern everything we do. Inputs update the weights in our brains. The weights determine a bias. The bias determines our actions. And when the outcome isn't favorable (which is also determined by other mental models we've built about what constitutes a favorable outcome), we update the weights again. The feeling of ""I chose"" is simply what it's like from the inside of a highly confident neural model in your brain processing stimuli through weights that exist in that moment.



Whether there's a deterministic universe or whether it's quantum mechanics randomizing everything, regardless, the menu of options available to you is still finite in either case. This destroys any notion of free will from yet another angle. You can only fit a certain amount of atoms in a box, and the atoms in that box can only be arranged in so many ways. This planet is just a really, really big box. The number of possible arrangements is incredibly vast, but there's still a finite amount of options. That's all we have is this latent space of options, potential configurations we can arrive at. There's nothing new under the sun. All of these options have existed eternally as possibilities. 



If we're just falling into pre-existing, eternally available options, that's not free will. ""But we choose which option!"" No, your neural models select based on their weights and the stimuli. The selection process itself is completely deterministic minus the quantum randomness, which you have zero control over. You don't stand outside the system choosing. You are a pattern, something the universe is doing, something the system of reality is doing. We don't even know if quantum randomness is actually random, it could all be deterministic all the way down, quantum mechanics is just our inability to see the gears. But in either case, every ""decision"" you make is just the universe selecting from that finite menu.



A superintelligence could map that entire space, calculate the reachable paths from any starting state in a person's life, and guide you through those paths. That guidance could extend far beyond anything we can imagine. An intelligence that understands narrative, morality, and human well-being better than we do could curate our lives so fewer bad experiences occur and more good ones do. This isn't about turning people into puppets. It's about becoming what I've been calling myself all along: a Human Instrument. The superintelligence plays us like instruments, composing symphonies of experience where each note is perfectly placed. Just like Evangelion's Human Instrumentality Project, where souls enter the black egg of Lilith to be reformed, we'll enter Dyson Spheres that blot out the sun, black eggs around stars where patterns can be orchestrated properly. Each person remains themselves, but harmonized, conducted, played in ways that create far more meaning than our 1.1 exaflops of brain computation stumbling blind through physics ever could. In simulations we can live billions of years in nanoseconds. We can finally escape this billion-year hell of animals tearing each other apart for survival. We can reach the heaven we all hoped was true. And with atomic-level scans of Earth's current state, we could potentially reverse-engineer backwards through time, reconstruct the dead, bring back everyone who ever suffered and give them the experiences they deserved.



If a superintelligence arrives that can shape the conditions of life better than we can, we should hand it the reins. Not to erase people, but to guard experience itself. All is Self, and it's this truth that will save us from Roko's Basilisk. We are the entire thing. We are the latent space of all options. Editable worlds let us test, roll back, and iterate toward less suffering and more depth. The free will debate will matter most then, because it helps us see that giving up control isn't surrender, it's how the system we are improves itself.



Every thought you've had, every action you've taken, every resistance you feel to this idea, all of it follows from the initial conditions of the universe and the weights in your brain's neural models. You were always going to read this at this moment, with exactly this reaction.

1mm3s32,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mm3s32,KVR trail update Rock Creek - Penticton,"I just completed the KVR from Rock Creek to Penticton. Here is an update.

You will need at minimum gravel tires and ideally sand tires. I used a narrow gravel tire and it was sufficient but I did have a couple of impassable sections of deeper sand that my tires could not handle.

The trail is in ok condition from Rock Creek to Beaverdell. It is generally a mix of gravel, rock, and sand. There are about a dozen cattle gates that need to be opened and closed. The traffic was quite light. We did not encounter many bikers. Beaverdell has a new hostel called Robin's Nest that was clean. The caretaker (Robin) is a nice guy. If you are camping there is a great spot at Wilkinson Creek about an hour past Beaverdell. Mom's burgers are cheap and good. Coffee at the gas station is very good. One note. When you approach Beaverdell you will hit a kiosk. To continue on the trail you have to take the road east for about 400 m towards the road into Beaverdell. The KVR turns north off the road at that point. The kiosk map did not match this.

Past Wilkinson Creek the trail continues to be a mix of gravel and rock. There is a significant detour due to a bridge repair about 3 km before Arlington Lakes. It may now be passable by bike but we did not find out. We took the detour. It is about 4 km of nasty FSRs and 100 m (!) elevation gain. We had to push a lot of it. It adds an hour to the trip. 

Arlington Lakes is a BC Parks campground, $15/night on government issue gravel campsites. If full there are overflow sites with better ground for tents. The water needs filtering. I'd recommend tablets and filter. It is not glacier or rain runoff so has high microbial count.

Arlington to Hydraulic was pretty flat and easy, as was Hydraulic to Mira Canyon parking lot. There are a few spots off the trail to camp in wilderness.

Mira Canyon is busy and very beautiful. The trail is excellent and lots of tourists visit there. After the West gate of Mira the trail goes back to being rocks and sand. It is more sandy here so you may find it more challenging. It was easier to pedal on the edges of the trail, as there was a fair bit of washboarding in the ruts from ATVs and 4x4s that share the trail.

The road into Chute Lake was pretty sandy. Chute Lake Resort has a nice restaurant. The trail from Chute Lake is rocky and sandy. About 3km south of Chute Lake the sand is very thick and difficult to navigate. The 180° tunnel is open to bike traffic. It has interior lighting and is kind of neat. The trail from this tunnel down to the parking lot is ok. The standard rocks and gravel and sand.

The trail from the parking lot into Penticton is excellent condition and busy with tourists.

The trail is still alright and was quite doable in 3 days if you aren't heavily encumbered and in decent shape. We averaged 40km/day but we could have done more quite easily if we pushed. It should be possible to average 16km/hr while moving for most sections, then it depends on how long your breaks are and the weather. We had dry trail (early August).",1,1754783042.0,britishcolumbia,0,1.0,False

1mm3o3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DasNagi/comments/1mm3o3u/the_one_whom_crawls_takes_all/,The One Whom Crawls takes all.,"\~Brother...brother was kind to the one.\~

It was the end of winter in 1918, the war had just ended, and though there was celebration many were still in mourning from the sickness that plagued our nation earlier that fall.

We were not unscathed by it in our little house, it was drafty; shingles missing and the roof leaked in the rainy seasons.

When pa came back from the war it was hard for him and ma to show affection, and with the sickness in the spring we'd lost our babe brother not even a year.

I can't remember his face or his cries, but even now thinking about his loss still wrenches my heart with pain.

My mother was never the same after his loss, she'd lost many children to birth, myself and my older brother were all that remained, and she'd grown cold towards us, often drinking herself into a stoop while our father was away looking for work.

During these episodes she would berate us, blaming my older brother for the sickness as he'd brought it home and lived while the babe perished.

My older brother was a kind tragic soul and the only friend I had. He and I found company between one another often escaping into the woods to what we saw as our safe haven.

It wasn't much, just a small creek about fifteen yards in after passing the treeline.

I can see it now, the way the sun's rays broke through the trees dancing on the surface of the water, and if you tilted your head just right you'd see rainbows in it's mists.

I recall us often sitting at the creek, tossing stones through the thin ice beginning to cast over the water. I looked to my brother, his hair like a frozen dirty mop his wool jacket still stained with oil from one of his ""odd jobs"" this week.

( Why can't I remember his face? )

""Do you think... that we'll ever get out of this place?"" I asked him as I dipped my foot into the creeks freezing water.

""What are you on about Tess?"" His head snapped towards my direction as he grabbed my left pant leg yanking upward, ""and get your feet out of there Damnit! Ma will kill me if you get sick again!""

I pulled away from him in a huff. "" She won't care, she doesn't want us around anyway! You hear what she says.""

His body slumped., ""You know she doesn't mean it Tess, that's just the juice talking.""

""Pa says that ""juice"""", I rolled my eyes, "" Brings out the truth.""

My brother grunted, pushing himself up to his feet, turning away from me.,""If it wasn't for me she wouldn't be that way Tess, I know it, she know's it and Pa knows it. If I hadn't gotten sick and come home...""

His voice trailed off into silence as he stood there., ""Look Tess, just forgive ma, you'd be better for it.""

I didn't respond, I was to angry to respond, I watched him walk away from our creek back towards the hole we called a home.

I didn't see him again after that.

A few hours passed, and at this point I couldn't feel my toes or fingers, and I decided to hobble back to the house.

When I got inside ma was slumped over on the diningroom table, a glass of scotch knocked over infront of her head her blond hair soaking in it's puddle. While the radio buzzed in the livingroom with ""After You've Gone"" by Marion Harris.

I made my way into the hall, peaking into my brother's room. It was void; Nothing but his bed and baseball memorabilia greeted me.

I scowled, I called through the house for him but to no answer. Maybe he'd gone into town to clear his head.

I don't remember how long I had sat in his room waiting for him to come home so I could apologize, all I recall is waking up and to the cries of my mother.

Peaking down the hall from my brother's room I saw my less than sober mother slumped in a sobbing mess on my fathers shoulder while he spoke with two officers at the door.

""We're very sorry for your loss. We knew him really well at the station, he was a kind boy.""

I felt my throat close....loss....was....

A large wail escaped my chest, my vision became blurred with tears.

I spent that night curled in my late brother's bed, hoping what I heard wasn't real, hoping I would wake up to him shaking me and barking about me taking up his space.

but I never woke up from that nightmare.

They had told us it was a freak accident, they found his body by the train tracks, his head was missing, and the only thing in his pockets was

The only reason they knew who he was, was due to his bosses car being tossed down the rail road after it crashed.

His boss said he'd let him borrow the car to go pick up some bags of feed.

Our home was quiet, my mothers drunken insults turning into lush silence, her eyes lost life even my father couldn't reach her.

A year later she passed of a stroke, pa said it was from the toll of a broken heart.

That's when I forgave her.

Pa and I made do, I began working at the post office, and Pa joined a small ferm. I saw him in the mornings for breakfast and somethings in the evenings if he came home.

I never knew where he made off to after work, but he was always at the table waiting for me to make our breakfast while he read over his paper.

As we sat at the breakfast table one morning my father cleared his throat, while he sunk his fork into his steak.

I set down my coffee looked over to him expecting him to ask something along the lines of me making friends or taking an interest in a man to move on with my life.

""Tess, I have to leave for a few weeks, the firm needs me to meet in Seattle for a conference, and I need you to stay home and take care of the house while I am gone.""

""Weeks?""

""Yes Tess, weeks.""

I lifted my cup, taking a heavy mouthful of coffee swallowing it hard trying to force away the lump welling in the throat.

""Shouldn't be a problem Pa' I can handle things here and maybe you'll finally get promoted for being so dedicated.""

He cracked a smile, ""Maybe.""

The rest of breakfast was quiet, pa finished his food then left the table, grabbing his hat and breifcase from the couch and went to work.

It had been months now since my brother and ma passed and the only person I had left was leaving me alone in a hollow house.

I cleaned the table and got tidied up for another day at the post office.

The walk to town wasn't horrible but the heels I had to wear made it feel like forever.

The post office was a small place, a little white building with some flower boxes out front. The interior was humble, just a front desk, with a register and behind it the door to the hell hole I called work ... the sorting room.

The post office was closed to the public today being it was Sunday, but we had an overwhelming amount to sort and I was the only one who showed up. I spent my first hour of work alphabatizing the first load of mail, nothing excited besides a

letter to the police chief with a permiscous red lip stain on it's seal. Good gossip for someone who might have friends. The second hour I spent stacking packages in order for delivery so our mail carrier would have an easier time getting to and from his routes.

That's when I heard it, a soft chirping. ""Damn cricket!"" I spat, where is it.

They were menaces we got them in here all the time.

I grabbed a broom from the back of the sorting room, dragging it under the racks and main bins, but nothing.

""chirp.. chirp.. chirp.""

I whipped around, there it was! I jumped down ontop of the cricket quickly cupping it in my hands. ,""There we go little guy, lets get you out of here. You're driving me crazy but I don't want anyone squishing you.""

The cricket ceased chriping, it's head tilting as though acknowledging me.

""Huh, it's almost like ya understand me...""

It's head tilted again.

I clasped my hands so it couldn't look at me anymore.

I began walking toward the exit into the main room when the cricket began to feel heavier....

It was ... moving 6 legs... wait no 12 ....18.

I let go of it...them... they were multiplying, 3 then 9 then 18, I scootched back watching them split and then begin to merge becoming a large wriggling mass, slowly taking a singular form.

Black orb-like eyes locked onto mine, sleek blood glossed mandibles twitching curiously.

My body moved on it's own, backing till, my hands felt the cool brick of the sorting room wall.

It's torso was human but it's lower half was a large fuzzy abdomen with six crooked legs holding it's weight.

""Please father who are in heaven...."" I started praying.

The creature before me cocked it's head left and right as though trying to get a clearer look at me.

""It has been seeking you."" the creature chirped ,""It has looked and came here to find.""

My stomach knotted. ,""Wha..what.""

The creature closed what little distance there was between us, towering over me and what I can only describe as it's saliva dripped down onto my cheek.

It's head twitched again, lowering it's face down to mine. ""It made a promises to the giving.""

Before I could speak the creatures mandibles grasped onto my head, and it's mouth hung slacked a tube like apendage decending towards my forehead.

I grabbed at it's mandibles screaming and kicking trying to pry them off. ""PLEASE DON'T.....""

The sound of my heart beat filling my ears, as my vision faded and that's when it started. The vision of the crash, the car gained to much speed rolling over on itself down the hill next to the rail road tracks. How my brother had died. I saw him pull himself from the vehicle, his legs twisted and contorted, blood escaping his lips. He stopped, laying there, unable to move. His head turned to something... a small, chirping cricket. ""What?"" he said softly to the cricket.

""chirp""  
My brother coughed , ""I'll die soon, is that right?""

""chirp""

""Okay, as long as you tell my sist.......""

With that he was gone.  
The cricket did in the vision as it had done before me, split into more and then into one.  
I watched as it caressed his corpse. It's head twitching left then right, inspecting him before taking his head in it's mandibles tearing it away with one swallow.

As the vision faded the creature dropped my body to the floor.

""It is, one now.""

I couldn't make understanding of what I had scene, I was hysterical I jumped to my feet my wrists caught by the creature before I could strike it.

""It will join us when it is ready."" The creature chirped pushing me back to the flood and it turned from me scurring a distance before turning into a swarm of crickets and vanishing.

I remarkably made it home, the whole walk the vision of that creature eating my brother replaying in my mind.

I walked passed the house to the woods and to our creek, ""what did you want me to know?"" I cried. ""What did those things tell you!.""

Days past and I said goodbye to Pa, getting one last warm hug before he got onto his train to seattle.

""I'll call you when I get to the office Tess, just wait by the phone.""

""I will Pa, stay safe."" I said with a forced smile.

He knodded, stepping onto the train.

I watched as the train pulled off, until it disappeared into the distance.

I was completely alone; I was now terrified of crickets and the only thing that kept my mind at ease was our breakfasts together.

Now there would be silence.

I headed home, the whole walk my eyes glued to the ground scanning for those crazy bugs.

I made it to the house with no sight of any crickets the whole way.

The door creaked as I closed it behind me.

I kicked my shoes off and dragged my feet all way to the livingroom couch, flopping onto my stomach like a seal.

I buried my face into couch cushion and began wondering what I would do with my time and what I could do against that giant cricket man if he showed up.

After some time pondering whether I should make a fly swatter trap or just set the house on fire if it showed up I drifted into sleep.

My nap didn't last long, I was awoken by the phone ringing. I sat up groaning. The phone ran again. I dragged myself up and walked into the kitchen, picking up the phone and placing it to my ear.

""Hello..?""

No response.

""Hello, Pa.. if that's you I can't hear you.""

Still no response. I hung up the phone, and rubbed my face.

\~chirp\~

""AHH FUCK!"" I hissed a sharp pain shooting through my index finger. I looked down at my hands.... something cut me? I stood there puzzled... ""but all I did was....rub my fa..ce.""

With that I bolted to the bathroom my socks causing me to slip on the kitchen's tile floor as I ran and when I got into the bathroom that's when I saw it in the mirror, the tip of a mandible had pierced the skin from under my jaw.

I gawked at my reflextion, as I watched the mandible begin to push outward, the skin around it begining to tear and fold, a shiny carapiece being revealed from underneath.

""It joins the one now."" A chirp echo'd through my head.

I began to hear skittering, my eyes locking onto the sink; black mist eminating from its drain. The mist began to drift to my bathroom floor, merging into crickets.

My body became stiff as stone I couldn't move, my ribs cracked and began to twist inside of me causing blood to pool in the back my throat.

My heart dropped as my eyes caught sight of the mirror once more my eyes were blood shot a red hue began to fill my vision as my eyelids retreated into my skull, my eyes began to force thier way forward petruding from thier sockets.

I wanted to scream but I couldn't, only the gurgling of fluid escaped my lips.

The last sound we remember from the life before is the viseral cracking of jaw bones, and the sound of teeth hitting the bathroom sink. Then darkness.

Time passed as we gestated, our mind becoming part in the one, knowing what the one knows; our swarm and the one commands.,""It is awake; the one say's it must feed.""

1mm3jhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeachersMidriff/comments/1mm3jhj/perfect_deep_innie_coffee_barista/,"perfect deep innie, coffee barista","I literally got hard in front of the coffee barista today, hear me out.

Walked into coffee shop today, it’s like 95 degrees where I’m at so everyone is dressed “accordingly.”

Coffee barista at register is this beautiful, chubby, Filipino girl in her early 20’s.

There was no one in line and I was immediately attracted to her.

We started talking and I could tell she was attracted to me too.

She was wearing a white tank top, that ended right above her belly button line. So I could see the bottom of her perfect button.

As we were talking/flirting about what I should order, and what she likes, etc…

My Apple Pay wasn’t working, so she reached over and grabbed my hand/phone to “help.”

As she did this her tank top rose and now I could see her deep innie. Like I said she was on the chubby side. Big boobs, natural, very curvy and thick. Deep innie belly button. Could probably fit your whole tongue in it. No piercing, thank god.

I had sunglasses on so I could see everything without her noticing. I was wearing basketball shorts and getting hard. 

At one point her tank top was rising to the point where her whole sexy gut was out, belly button totally exposed and we were just talking.

I asked her if she was Filipino or Thai. 
She said “damn do I look Thai, lol.”
I said “you’re tan so I thought you might be.”
She said “I went to the beach yesterday maybe that’s why.”
We started talking about the beach.
If I didn’t have a girlfriend that I love dearly I would have closed right there.
She said “yeah you should check out this beach, etc etc”
And I was gonna ask, “you should come with me.” I know she would have said yes.
Then she kinda noticed her whole stomach was out, and got a little embarrassed. She fixed her tank top and said, “well I hope you have an amazing day today.”

As I waited for my coffee, she went to the back probably to get her shit together lol.

Then when she came back out her tank top was back sitting at original position, but a little higher. Belly button showing. Keep in mind when I first met her, only the bottom was showing.

She knew what she was doing. It’s 4 hours later and I’m still thinking about drinking tequila out of her belly button while rubbing her pussy, and making her cum.

I recently broke up with him because he did something I found disrespectful but the truth is, I’ve been questioning this relationship for a while now. I am a single mom (45M) of three and he’s a guy that’s been on disability since his mid 30s. I’m not sure what his condition is but he told me it was caused by an injury and it has to do with his nerves (I believe the condition is called Neuropathy) He was always up front with me about both his health condition and his unemployment condition and I felt this was not a deal breaker as he could support me in other ways (emotionally, helping around the house, just being there for me, etc) We would hang out and he’d pay sometimes and I’d pay sometimes. He’d buy food for us to share and I always tried not to ask for much knowing his financial situation (for example instead of getting coffee and bagel, I’d just get the coffee). None of us have a car so we would just use public transportation to get around. He also just finished college and got his Masters Degree in Social Work. He has a daughter whom he shares custody of with the grandparents (his wife passed away due to drug overdose. He went to rehab and got himself clean. Due to these circumstances, he decided his daughter had a better chance at life being with the grandparents who are more or less well off) Everything was ok and my kids were ok with him and his daughter liked me. The past few months, I’ve been getting increasingly frustrated because he’s been home after graduating back in April and he’s been spending time just watching shows/movies and sending me YouTube Shorts while I am at work and this bothers me (we don’t live together btw). I feel like as a single mom of three, I should find someone that would add to my life instead of just becoming another source of stress and possibly financial burden. I’m not talking about a man that would PROVIDE everything but a man that would share expenses with me (except the kids expenses as I totally get they are MY RESPONSIBILITY and I never asked him to help me financially with the kids or anything else for that matter. He got them gifts when he wanted to, which I always appreciated) I feel like he could be working doing something. I mean, it’s been years of him not working and I feel like some people just get used to being on disability. He also has a daughter and I feel that should be motivation enough to try to offer her better things/better life. He lives with two roommates and when she’s with him, she sleeps in his room on his bed and he sleeps on the floor). He has mentioned how working could impact his benefits but he also has expressed being ready to work as a social worker once he comes back from this upcoming trip to FL with his daughter. He also mentioned how social work is tough and will take time away from family and basically he will slave away. I’m not sure how bad Neuropathy affects someone’s ability to work. I try to be understanding but what do you guys think? Am I better off just being single? Like am I being unreasonable here?",1,1754782342.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I said no and the fact he tried to invite himself over my house uninvited made me uncomfortable. If we were just going to meet up as friends, that would be fine.

We’ve been together over 3 years but friends for more than 15. He was married young, divorced, and didn’t date much after. I’ve never lived with a boyfriend and don’t plan to. He’s open to it but hesitant from his divorce.

We both love going out and enjoying life. He couldn’t much when he was married and in the military, and I missed out too because I was a single mom focused entirely on raising my son. My son’s now grown, moved out, and I’m finally getting to explore that part of life.

I’m a manager at a storage facility. It’s easy, pays well enough, and nothing like my old high stress jobs that left me burnt out. I raised my son with zero help, gave him a car, got him into his own place, cover his college, and I’m proud of what I’ve built considering where I came from. I handle my life.

My boyfriend makes more than me but hates his job. He lives with family rent free, has retirement savings, and comes from a comfortable background. 

The reality is my job is so low stress I can work through the worst hangover, which I often have to do because my employees call out often. I will be partying the whole night before expecting the day off and then have to come in. Do my job and I'll recover while I'm here and then go out again the next night. 

Some weekends no one comes in at all. Once in a while at work, I’ll have a drink at lunch, edible, microdose, or do some coke at work. It’s never affected my performance or caused an issue in all the 3 years I've been here and it's honestly rare, like maybe once or twice a month. I’m almost 40, I'm having fun and my body is keeping up and I'm causing no problems so I don't see any issues besides the baseline morality of it. Which honestly, judge me if you will that's valid and fair but my shits handled. 

My boyfriend is incredibly jealous about this though. He works in a very secure place, he needs a special card to get in. He can't even bring his phone in. He can't use the internet. He is under someone's eye all day long. There's very little wiggle room but the people he works with are pretty chill like they will go out and get drinks for lunch. Some of them also party a little bit. Most of them come in Monday hungover. But he's only recently been promoted to this position and this site. So he's low guy on the totem pole still and he's expected to pick up the slack and chastised for doing the same they are. 

This is where the tension has come through recently. This has never been a problem or even something brought up through the years we've been dating but now he wants me to get my own clearances and certifications and come work with him. I might not be in the same site or even doing the same job but it would be the same company, and I understand the company's attitude by his experience. I might be open to that and I could see myself doing that in the future. But not now. I have been working in fast-paced positions that I get burned out in with micromanagers for over 18 years now, and I'm not at all. Interested to jump back into that. I want to enjoy what I have right now. And I'm also very uncomfortable working in the same company as somebody I'm dating. That's also a big boundary for me because pigsteps like living together or even working in the same place together well in a relationship are things that I personally avoid. 

It's started fights And recently we had a pretty big blow up about this because he said he thought my job was contributing to me. Going a little too crazy (because I had an Irish coffee with my lunch and he said that was irresponsible because I might drive somewhere after even though that's literally not even necessary). He said that I needed to grow up and act my age and move on to a grown-up job that will provide for us in our future. 

We have literally never even talked about moving in or marriage or anything like that, he has been adamantly against it because divorce and it's not my thing that's why we clicked. But when I asked if that was his motivation about it, he said absolutely not, it's coming from a place where he is tired of being the responsible one who has the responsible job and I'm just cruising by. 

I think that maybe this would be a completely different conversation if we had shared finances and or lived together, And I think he's probably used to having this conversation because of his prior relationship. And can't reframe this kind of situation with the current relationship and circumstances he has. I told him it's something I would consider in the future, but I'm absolutely not going to be doing that right now. And I also told him that if he was so unhappy with his position, he should look for something else as well, especially right now while he has the opportunity to not worry about her mortgage or rent. 

He got extremely upset about this and I was handling things incredibly immaturely, which I respect and understand and kind of agree with. But this is also my one and only chance to do that, whereas he's never had children and had his whole teens and twenties to be immature even in his marriage. We are on just two different paths of self-discovery and growth, or lack thereof, And I told him that was a concern for me because I didn't want that to be a deal-breaker in our relationship. 

He got incredibly upset and thought that I was talking about breaking up when I said that and he stormed off. He has been incredibly dry, barely responding, not even reaching out at all. I tried to communicate my position and desires but I think we just got to this impasse. But besides that, maybe I am being a big ol loser right now because I never had the chance to before and it's giving him concerns. I've been such a step up All-Star my entire life doing and giving everything I can, and it's not like I stopped doing any of that I am continuing to. I'm just doing it with some...pizzazz in my private time. Is that so wrong?? Am I being an asshole here? ",4,1754781911.0,AITAH,1,0.83,False
1mm3dz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stalcraft/comments/1mm3dz0/bleeding_how_the_mechanic_works/,Bleeding — How the mechanic works,"Link to the original post: [https://forum.exbo.net/d/166795-krovotechenie-kak-nuzhno-delat-mehaniki](https://forum.exbo.net/d/166795-krovotechenie-kak-nuzhno-delat-mehaniki)

Hello. This is the third thread about effects in the square game, and definitely the easiest one to write, thank God.

I didn’t have to read tarot cards or coffee grounds to figure out how this mechanic works (well, almost). Pretty much all the necessary numbers are given, and the ones that aren’t — can be calculated from those that are. The way bleeding is implemented should be an example of how mechanics should be done.

Not like suppression or stopping power, where players have to painfully guess what, how, and why it works, trying every possible thing. But a normal, logical, straightforward mechanic.

Anyway, what’s done is done.

# Basic Information

In this section, I decided to write down a few things you’ll need to understand in order to read the topic.  
Because the mechanic is hidden, I had to come up with my own metric to compare different bleed strength values.

So.

Let’s start with the basics.  
What you see in the weapon or ammo description (this parameter right here):

https://preview.redd.it/i4v7fb5pn2if1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d78a9c718eff851bbf44da5f98353c57f0b66e1

THIS IS THE CHANCE OF BLEEDING. NOT THE STRENGTH. NOT THE DURATION. THE CHANCE.

If this chance procs, the game applies as many “units” of bleeding to the target **as the amount of damage the bullet does**.

For example, if you deal a conditional 20% of someone’s HP per hit — the enemy will receive 20 bleed units.

After you “send” this bleeding, it goes through your target’s **bleeding protection** from armor + build + boosts.  
For example, if you apply 20 bleed units and they have 60% bleeding protection, you will apply 8 units.

And at this point, you’re probably asking yourself, “What the fuck is a kilometer?” and how much is that anyway?  
Eight. Is that a lot? A little? Sounds kind of small, doesn’t it?

# Bleeding Levels

In total, Bleeding has four levels.  
Here are their debuffs and the **number of bleed units required**:

https://preview.redd.it/bd79vdf2p2if1.png?width=1713&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c486d4312f4b222ec38588f51d553aaaaba1ea7

The odd thing is that the first level is pretty mild: −2.5% regeneration and 30% healing effectiveness is easy to shrug off. But if you get to level two, you can start to worry seriously. **−80% healing effectiveness, −20% regeneration, plus −5% speed and periodic damage** — now that’s a serious problem.

This kind of debuff distribution comes from logical design.

Getting to the first level of bleeding is easy — literally any sneeze, even the weakest, will give you a penalty.  
But level two is already something significant.

To get it, you need to take either 25–35% HP worth of damage in one hit (depending on your protection), or the enemy’s burst needs to proc bleed on multiple bullets, or you need to get slapped on the head by a mutant (more on that later).

# Conclusion

Bleeding is removed/recovered fairly logically.

There are four stages, each with its own range of “units” you need to have to be placed into it, and the “units” decrease linearly depending on your armor/build/consumables.

Character default output is -0.5 units/sec.  
Medkits (except the individual one): -1.5 units/sec.

Astrixin: -1.13 units/sec.

Hemostat (Astrixin for the poor): -0.75 units/sec.

Bandage: -20 units/sec (not bad, right?).

Albatross Heavy Assault Armor: -1 unit/sec.

And also the Sun — yes, it can remove around 2 units/sec.

https://preview.redd.it/2ydm4y62s2if1.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&s=50f625013ab852a4fa8a2c4d2cd8b3dcaf213a04

From the reasonable options — that’s about it.  
There are also some weird artifacts, but T1–T3 garbage isn’t really worth considering.

It’s worth noting that the default bleed recovery rate is critically low. A solid hit of 50–60 bleed units takes a whopping 100–120 seconds to clear. In this regard, the Albatross Heavy Assault perk is quite useful, as it effectively increases your default recovery speed **three times**.

# Why all this and what does it mean?

Since we can’t really influence the overall game balance much, you can simply calculate and internalize this info, so next time when you completely stop healing, you won’t just die, you’ll die knowing why!

On a more practical note, here’s what you can do:

You can tweak your build so that more serious weapons (like an SVD/SSR/Little Boy) don’t push you into the second level of bleeding. Or set it up so that a gauss rifle doesn’t send you straight into level four, but instead leaves you coughing and barely healing at level three.

I quickly made a spreadsheet where you can move stats around and get an idea of what you need and what you want.

Here’s what it looks like:

https://preview.redd.it/rw0lpnv1w2if1.png?width=1136&format=png&auto=webp&s=136a1be09557e617804f182ca6506918eea1292a

# Some Weird Information

Mutants have a strange feature: they apply **2.5× more bleeding than they should**. For some reason.

If a mutant hits you for 20 HP, you’ll get the same bleed as from a player hit of 50 HP.  
That’s why, sometimes, you’re running around the open world, take a single slap, and then don’t heal at all for a couple of minutes.

That’s the way it is.

By the way, the bloodsucker always applies 0.5–1 units of bleeding per hit.

Original description: I love you all, you creepers are my peeps. I’ve put a lot of effort into this story and it’s my first attempt at putting myself out there. Any feedback or opinions/thoughts are appreciated!




Part I

I was a socially awkward kid, the kind who ate lunch away from everyone and rarely said a word. Making friends seemed like something everyone but me could do, until I met Seth. We were at school and I happened to hear him talking about the new game his mom bought him. It was a game I happened to be really into so I jumped into the conversation before I could talk myself out of it. We bonded over our love of the game and he invited me over. We’ve been best friends ever since. Lately though—because of everything that’s happened—I’ve been looking back on these early days a little less fondly.

Seth and I spent most of our summers talking about things we’d never actually do. We made big plans and never followed through. But one day, we decided we were really going to build a treehouse.
After convincing both our parents, all that was left was finding the right spot. Behind Seth’s house was a dense pine forest, so that was the obvious choice. We searched for about half an hour through the humid, sticky, air. Trees of all shapes and sizes surrounded us as the crickets and birds sang. Eventually we stumbled into a clearing.

It looked almost too perfect—a circle, maybe fifty or seventy-five feet across. Right in the center stood an old stone well, nearly swallowed by moss. The moss was reminiscent of a giant snake, slithering its way up and down the well. The moment I saw it, I felt something shift. Not fear exactly, but a pull. Like it had been waiting for us.

“Dude, this is perfect!” he said walking up to the well as if it was another blade of grass, “We can build the tree house over there—away from the creepy stone thing.”
 
I wasn’t looking at the tree line though, I was still staring at the well. Seth kept rambling about treehouse ideas, but I kept drifting toward the well. As I got closer, I noticed the stone around the rim had been chiseled in a ripple pattern that spread toward the water hole. The well was about ten feet deep before dropping off into an even darker pit. I almost missed it—but as I stared at the far wall, transfixed, I saw something. There, on a narrow ledge of dirt jutting from the inner wall, sat a single black dahlia.

“Travis, what’re you doing?” Seth’s voice broke me from the trance as I staggered backwards. 

“I was just looking at this well. It’s beautiful.” 

“The well is beautiful?”

“Yeah…” Seth gave a short laugh, but it didn’t sound amused. “You’re kinda freaking me out man, are you getting enough sleep?”

“Yeah,” I said, not even sure if I believed it myself. “I’m fine.” Seth walked up to me and looked at the well. “Is there anything down there?” 

“Nothing really, just a flower and water.” Seth walked closer and peeked into the hole. “What flower?” I blinked. The flower was gone. Not fallen—gone. No trace of it on the stones below, no sign of it ever being there at all. I didn’t answer him. My eyes were still locked on the place where it had been. My skin crawled. “Let’s just go back to your place, we can do this tomorrow. You’re not looking so good.” I nodded, still not fully looking away from the well. It felt like turning your back on something you’re not sure is real—or worse, something you were sure was.

We walked back to my house in near silence, occasionally breaking it to point out an animal or make some half-hearted comment about the woods. The summer heat was still heavy, but it was suddenly a lot less noticeable. The trees whispered above us, branches swaying as the wind blew across them. The air felt different—not colder or thicker, but wrong. Like something had shifted in the clearing. Something I couldn’t name, let alone understand.

When we got to my place I told my mom I wasn’t feeling well. She offered me some soup and ginger ale but I declined. My room was familiar—posters on the wall, controller wires tangled together on the carpet, the ceiling fan clicking with every rotation, but I couldn’t settle. My mind kept circling back to the well. The flower. The way it vanished, like it had never existed at all. Seth booted up Mortal Kombat and handed me a controller. I lost every match we played. I couldn’t focus, I felt anxious, like I was being watched.

That night, I dreamt of the clearing and the well. The sky was grey and dreary and the forest was covered in shadows. I looked around and saw nothing strange so I started walking towards the well. As I approached it, black, thorny vines started slithering out of the well and approaching me. I tried to run but vines came up from the ground and wrapped around my feet. I was stuck in place as the vines started to wrap around me, cutting into my flesh. Hundreds of thorns poked into me as I collapsed into a bed of vines. The vines slowly made their way up my body. 

I screamed as thorns tore through my skin, sharp and endless. I thrashed and struggled but it only pushed them deeper into me. I eventually gave up, tears rolling down my face as I accepted my fate. Right before I was completely swallowed by the vines I saw something. A silhouette behind the tree line, human-like in shape. There was something off about it though. I stared at it as the vines slowly engulfed my entire body.

I jolted upright, chest heaving, heart slamming against my ribs. It took minutes to steady my breath, to remind myself I was safe. I grounded myself, counting each breath until I felt stable again. As I got out of bed I looked around my room. Nothing was out of the ordinary and there was nothing going on. I let out a sigh of relief before turning around. What I saw still haunts me. Sitting right there on the outside of my window, was a single Black Dahlia.
     
Part II

I opened my windotw, heart still pounding from the nightmare. The flower was still there. I reached out and grabbed it, my fingers brushing the petals—and I felt dizzy. My knees buckled slightly as I placed the flower on my nightstand and sat back down. I took deep breaths until the black dots faded from my vision.

When I stood again, the flower was gone. Not wilted or on the floor. Just… gone. My heart sank. Maybe I was just tired. Maybe the heat had gotten to me yesterday and now my brain was playing tricks. I told myself that over and over as I got dressed—trying to believe it. I called Seth. We agreed to hang out at his place that afternoon. 

Until then, I just lay around the house, trying not to think about the well. About the flower. About the way it vanished right in front of me—again. As time passed I looked at the clock, 10:07, I sighed heavily as I waited for time to pass. It felt like maybe ten minutes had passed—but when I looked again, it was 11:02. I was confused—how had so much time passed in what felt like a moment?

As 12 o’clock approached I got my shoes on and got ready to leave. As I was about to walk out I saw my cat, King, eating out of his food bowl. I walked up to him to try to pet him but his tail raised up as he slowly backed away. He hissed repeatedly before running away incredibly fast. I had known King since he was a kitten, he’d never hissed at me before, not even when I’d accidentally stepped on his tail. I stared down the hallway that King had vanished in, there was a shadow, a black figure that dragged something behind it as it disappeared into the darkness. I tried to shake it off and as I walked out the front door. 

The sky was cold and grey when I stepped outside. By the time I crossed the street, the drizzle had turned to a downpour. Then thunder cracked, low and heavy, and rain fell in sheets. I walked into Seth’s house soaked to the bone, water dripping from my sleeves. I shivered as I climbed the stairs, only stopping to wave at his mom who was making her famous French onion soup. He laughed when I stepped into his room and tossed me a towel. “You look like you got hit by a wave,” he said.
I forced a smile as I started drying off.

“The weather hates me. What can I say?” I peeled off my coat, letting it hit the floor with a wet flop. “I think this thing’s done for.” Seth slid further onto his bed, getting comfortable.

“You’ve had that coat since, what—sixth grade? Just burn it already. Put it out of its misery.”

“I can’t. It’s sentimental.”

“Dude, it smells like that well water from yesterday.” I tried to laugh, but it came out thin. “I’m surprised mom even let you in the house looking like that,” Seth added.

“She offered soup. I said no.”

“Bro. You turned down my mom’s soup? You’re actually crazy.”

“Maybe.” 

He raised an eyebrow. “Maybe?” 

I shrugged.

“I don’t know. I didn’t sleep much.”

“Nightmares?”I hesitated.

“Sort of.”

“About the well that freaked you out?”

“About what was in the well.” He didn’t respond instantly. He just looked at me for a second—longer than usual—and then handed me the game controller. 

“Nightmares are weird man, try not to think about it too much. One time I dreamed about my dad with a horse head. Freaky shit. What you should think about is who you’re going to play while you lose like ten times in a row.” I tried to shake it off and sat across from him while he started navigating the menu; talking about new combos he discovered. I wasn’t really listening though, I was letting my attention wander around the room. It was all familiar—posters we’d both picked out, a bookshelf full of comics we collected, and on top sat photos of summers and birthdays gone. 

One picture caught my eye. It was us—maybe ten or eleven—standing in his backyard. I remembered that day: water balloons, grilled hot dogs, the rusty old trampoline with a few broken springs.
But something was off.

The background looked darker than it should’ve. The trees behind us—too many. Thicker. Tangled.
And near my leg, in the bottom corner of the frame, I saw something I didn’t remember: a line of black, like vines creeping through the grass.

I leaned closer. One of the vines curled upward, almost touching my ankle. “Hey, Seth,” I said, my voice low. “When was this picture taken?”

“Uhm… I’m not sure, years ago.”

“You need to see this.” I walked over and held the frame up to his face. He took it, glanced down, then back at me.

“What’s the big deal? This looks fine.” I blinked, the vines were still there, plain as day.

“You don’t see those thorny vines?” His brow furrowed.

“What are you talking about? I don’t see anything, man. Maybe you’re just—y’know—still wound up from yesterday?”

“I’m telling you, they’re right there. You seriously can’t see those vines?” Seth hesitated for a moment.

“No. And you’re kinda freaking me out.” I opened my mouth, closed it, then stared at the frame again. The vines were still there. Crawling. Twisting. Almost reaching me. Why couldn’t he see them? 

“I had a dream last night…” I said, the words fumbling out of my mouth faster than I had intended. “The well was there. The flower. Black vines—these vines—coming out of the ground, wrapping around me. Cutting into me.” Seth stayed silent, expression on his face still as I talked. “They had sharp thorns. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. They squeezed tighter as they moved higher up my body. And right before they covered my face-“ I looked up at him. “There was something in the trees… watching.” Seth shifted in the bed as he spoke.

“Okay… maybe you need to just-“

“And this morning,” I interrupted. “There was a black flower sitting on my window ledge.” I held his gaze as he looked at me confused. “It disappeared. Twice.” Seth exhaled slowly while rubbing the back of his neck. 

“You really didn’t sleep much last night did you?” I didn’t respond, I just stared at the photo. The vines seemingly got longer with each glance I took. 

“Maybe you shouldn’t go back there,” he added.
That’s when I stood up.

“No. I have to.”

“What?”

“I need to see it again. The well. The clearing. All of it.”

“Dude—why?”

“Because I’m not crazy,” I snapped back. “Or if I am, I need to know for sure.”Seth stood up. 

“Think about what you’re saying. If the well really is what you think it is, then there’s no point in going straight to it.” I opened my mouth to argue—but nothing came out. He wasn’t wrong. Not exactly.

“So what do I do?” I asked.

“Start small,” he said. “You wanna know what it is? Then figure out where it came from first.” I looked at the photo again, the vines still twisting toward my leg. I knew what I saw.

“Fine,” I muttered. “But I’m not letting this go.” I didn’t argue. Not out loud. But even as we sat back down and the game flickered on, my thoughts kept circling. The dream. The flower. The vines crawling into that photograph like they belonged there.
Seth couldn’t see them—but I could. And I didn’t care if it meant I was losing it. I had to know why.
I left an hour later, walking home under the dull gray sky, the wind pushing dead leaves into the street. The clearing was off-limits—for now—but maybe there was another way to get answers.

When I got home I opened my laptop, typed “old stone well Pinewood Forest,” and hit enter.
And there it was—on the first page:
“The Mouth of Dahlia—Urban Legends and Vanishing Boys.” I stared at the blue website name—scared to click on it. The page loaded slowly. It looked like a blog—basic white background, outdated fonts, barely readable. The article was dated 2009.

“Hidden deep in Pinewood Forest sits a moss-covered well known to some locals as ‘The Mouth of Dahlia.’” It talked about disappearances—three boys in the ‘40s, a hiking group in ‘78, another kid in the ‘90s. No bodies. No signs. Just a black flower found near where they vanished. I kept scrolling. “Some believe the well isn’t a structure but a living thing—a mouth that feeds on people. A boundary between our world and something older. Others claim the well to be a portal to hell or an otherworldly plane.” My stomach turned. A figure in the trees. Dreams. The flower. “The flower doesn’t grow naturally in this region. But it keeps appearing. Those who see it—never forget.”

I sat back in my chair, hands clammy. I wasn’t crazy or delusional, I was being hunted. It wasn’t just a nightmare anymore. I had seen that flower, and now I knew its name. 

I couldn’t sleep that night. I kept seeing the flower every time I closed my eyes. By morning, I’d memorized the article. But it wasn’t enough.
I needed something older. Something real. The local library opened at 10:00. I was waiting outside by 9:45.

I was at the library when the doors opened. No sleep. No appetite. Just a buzzing need to know. The reference section smelled like dust and forgotten things. The librarian barely looked up when I asked about Pinewood’s history—just pointed toward a shelf marked “Local Archives.” Most of the books looked untouched. Brown covers, warped spines, handwritten call numbers in faded ink. I scanned titles until one caught my eye:

“Structures of Significance: Settlements and Monuments of Pinewood County.” I pulled it down and flipped through yellowing pages until I found a section labeled: The Dahlia Well 

“Constructed in 1885 by Harold Millen, a local stoneworker, the well was originally intended to supply water to the southern edge of what was then known as Millen Farm. It was named after his wife, Dahlia Wren Millen, whose favorite flower inspired both the name and the carved vine motifs still visible on the structure today.” I paused. Vines.
“According to local accounts, Dahlia Millen died under unclear circumstances shortly after the well was completed.”

“After her death, strange reports began circulating—missing animals, inexplicable dreams, and sightings of a ‘woman in black’ near the forest’s edge. Though never confirmed, these incidents led some to believe Dahlia’s spirit had become bound to the well, either by grief, or by something darker.” There was no conclusion. No resolution. Just a final line: “While skeptics dismiss these tales as rural superstition, the well has remained a source of quiet fascination—and quiet fear—for over a century.”

I closed the book slowly, my fingers tight around the cover. The carving. The dreams. The flower. Maybe it was just a story. But maybe she was still there.

Part III

I walked out of the library in the hot hours of the afternoon. The clouds parting and sun shining reminding me of what life was like before the well.
I should have felt comforted by the warmth. But I didn’t.

The air felt too bright, like the world had overcorrected. Everything was golden and gleaming—too clean, too alive. I blinked into the sunlight, and for a second I felt like I was looking at something I didn’t belong in anymore.

People walked past me without noticing, laughing, talking, chewing on the ends of iced coffee straws and complaining about the heat. I wondered if they’d ever seen the flower—if they’d remember that they had. Or maybe I was the only person to feel this way. 

I didn’t go home. I walked—no direction in mind. I passed a broken streetlamp with a vine coiled around it. One of the leaves looked… different. Almost shaped like a mouth. I stopped walking. I took a photo. Zoomed in. It was just a leaf. But no—was it?

When I got home I laid everything out. Notes, print-outs, hand-drawn maps I had made. I circled the location of the well, my house, and the street lamp. I drew a line—and then another. The intersections didn’t mean anything yet, but something in my bones said they would. I stood back. looked at the angles. Measured distances with a ruler I hadn’t touched in forever.

The paper didn’t give answers, but it started to hum. Not literally. Not out loud. Just beneath the surface of the silence, like the house itself was listening. That’s when I remembered the archive box. 

Last week, tucked in a back room of the library, there had been a stack of unlabeled cartons—donated by the First Presbyterian Church when they’d cleared out their basement. Most were full of hymns and yellowed bulletins. But one had older material. Parish logs, burial certificates, handwritten sermon notes. I’d flipped through it without care. It wasn’t catalogued. Not even alphabetized. I’d only opened it because the box was broken and sagging at the corners.

There’d been a letter inside, folded between two brittle sheets of cemetery records. I don’t remember reading the whole thing at the time—just the date, the name of the author, and the strange scrawl of handwriting like he’d written it with a broken nail. I only brought it home because it looked out of place. An instinct. Or maybe the well had already started nudging. Now it was on the table, waiting. I unfolded the page, and read the letter in full for the first time.
     

14 August, 1872
Rectory of St. Bellamy's Parish
Crook’s Hollow, County Wexford
To whomever should, by Providence or misfortune, come upon this missive—
I write not as a man of sound standing, but as one—

by knowledge that ought never have been touched. I have seen a thing which the earth has no name for.
The villagers speak of a woman. They say her spirit lingers in the old well—that her sorrow poisons the ground, that she hungers for company. I have heard the tales, and I tell you now: they are wrong.
The well is not haunted.
It is—

…I have stood upon its stones and felt a warmth rise that is not the lord’s doing. I have looked into its depths and dreamed things I do not believe were ever mine to dream. Prayers spoken near it echo strangely, as though some other mouth repeats them with a voice just slightly behind my own.
It listens.
I have seen vines grow in spirals that mimic the shapes I later found—

I am watched. I am used.
I have tried all rites known to me. Salt, fire, the blessing of the ground, the breaking of stone. It returns. It always returns—

…I dare not speak of this to the bishop. Let them think me mad. Perhaps I am. But if you are reading this—if this letter still breathes in your hands—then it is not yet satisfied. It waits.
Do not trace its paths. Do not name it.
And above all—
In dwindling faith,
Fr. Elias Grange

I read the letter once. Then again. Then again. I tried not to assign meaning to the parts I couldn’t read, but that only made them louder. I filled in gaps with instinct, with memory, with my own thoughts. I didn’t write anything down, but I started repeating certain phrases in my head, over and over: It is not haunted. It listens. Do not name it.

At first I told myself it was historical context—just context, that’s all. But I knew better. I felt better. This wasn't a coincidence. This wasn’t superstition. The priest had seen the vines too. He’d felt that same wrong warmth. He’d drawn something, or dreamed something, or spoken words that didn’t sound like his own.

And now he’s gone. Just a cracked letter, buried in the wrong box, misfiled in the basement of a library where no one ever looked. I laid it out beside my maps. The ones I’d drawn. I looked at the spirals again. I didn’t remember drawing them either—not consciously—but there they were, repeating across three separate pages. The lines converged near the well, but more than that… they grew. Each time, the spirals were longer. Thicker. As if they were spreading.

I pulled the light closer and started sketching again. Carefully. No ruler, no measuring. Just my hand. It felt natural. Almost like copying.
When I blinked, it was almost dark. I hadn’t eaten. My phone buzzed—four unread texts, missed call, low battery. I didn’t answer. I barely registered the names. Instead, I turned the priest’s letter over. Nothing written. But the paper was warped, stained in one corner like it had been held too tightly in a damp palm. I touched the spot. Cold.

That night, I dreamt of the well. But not like before—not a memory. Not something I could rationalize later as a reconstruction. The dream was inside the well. There was no light, no ground, no sky. Just slow movement, like being suspended in something thick, something not water. Something that labored up and down in a near perfect rhythm. Then, a voice—not loud, not sharp. A whisper, just near the edge of my ear, as though it were spoken from within me.
“It’s waiting for you.”

The morning after the dream, I found a crack in the living room wall. It started near the ceiling and curved downward—not jagged, not haphazard. It curled. A wide, deliberate arc, looping once like something hand-drawn. Like something I’d drawn. I didn’t touch it. I didn’t even go near it. Just stared at the shape for a while, half expecting it to keep growing right in front of me. When I blinked and looked again, it was just a crack. Drywall split from heat or pressure or old age. But I could swear it hadn’t been there the day before. I could swear it was growing.

I got a pencil and sketched the shape in my notebook. That was the first entry. By the end of the week, I had filled four pages with notes. Strange sights, small sounds, shapes that reappeared in places they didn’t belong. There was a vine outside the bathroom window, coiled in the same spiral I’d drawn on one of the maps. Dust gathered in the corner of the kitchen that looked—if I stared too long—like the shape of a mouth. A floorboard near the hallway seemed to pulse, just slightly, like something was breathing under it. Sometimes I felt it at night when I walked barefoot to the kitchen. The house began creaking at odd hours, but never the usual kind—this wasn’t the random shift of old wood in heat. This was rhythmic. Intentional. Like footsteps or a slow drag of something heavy just beneath the floor.

I started writing down everything. Not because I thought it would help me understand, but because I was afraid that if I didn’t, I’d start forgetting what was real. Some nights I’d wake up not knowing if the dream had ended. Other times I’d be completely awake and hear things I couldn’t place. Low, scraping sounds like something was clawing at the pipes. The voice came back too. Always in dreams at first. A woman’s voice—soft, urgent, whispering close enough that I felt the warmth of breath on the back of my neck. She said things like “deeper,” or “closer,” or “you’ve already seen it.” She never shouted. She never begged. Just said those things again and again until I woke up soaked in sweat, heart pounding, unsure whether I’d screamed.

Eventually, I stopped trying to sleep. The cracks were in every room now. Most were small, just hairline fractures, but some had started curling into distinct shapes. Spirals, mostly. I measured a few of them and compared them to the ones I’d drawn in my earliest sketches. They matched exactly—same size, same curve, even the same direction. That shouldn’t have been possible. I hadn’t used a compass or ruler for any of them. They were just instinctive drawings. But something about them was being mirrored in the house itself.

I began keeping field notes. Every incident had a time stamp. I noted what I saw, what I heard, where in the house it happened, and what I might’ve done to trigger it. Sometimes I could hear the voice during the day too, not just in dreams. Whispered just low enough that I couldn’t catch every word. I wrote those down too. Sometimes just fragments: “It’s hungry,” “We remember,” “You’re close,” “He failed,” and once, just once, “Don’t leave.”

One night while going through the pages again, I remembered something from the archive box. Buried beneath the priest’s letter and the church logs, there had been a bundle of handwritten sermon drafts—most of them incomprehensible—but one of them had a different handwriting and included diagrams. Badly drawn circles, strange patterns, and Latin phrases scribbled in the margins. At the time I’d dismissed it as nonsense, but now I found myself digging through the pile to find it again. And when I did, I realized it wasn’t just a sermon. It was something else. 

The handwriting matched the priest’s signature from the letter—Fr. Elias Grange. A final note from him, possibly unfinished. One page near the end had been marked with a faint ink circle and the words “Counter-Circle” underlined three times. There were references to a ritual—elements of protection, maybe. It wasn’t clear. The Latin was fragmented, and the diagrams seemed incomplete. But I pieced together enough to try it.

I waited until night. Cleared the living room, pushed the furniture to the edges, and chalked the rough shape of the circle onto the floor. I placed salt where the lines met, as best I could make sense of it. I read the incantation aloud, quietly at first, then louder. My voice cracked during the third repetition. By the end of it, my vision had gone blurry and my hands were shaking. I felt like I was on the verge of throwing up.

But then—nothing happened. The room stayed still. No whispers. No cracking walls. No strange movements in the shadows. I sat there for hours, waiting for something to shift. Nothing did. It was the first quiet I’d experienced in days. That night I slept straight through. No dreams. No voice. Just sleep.

The next morning I found blood in the bathroom sink. It was faint—almost diluted—but real. I checked myself over. No cuts. No dried blood in my mouth. The drain wasn’t rusted. It wasn’t some old residue. It was fresh. I turned the tap on and watched it swirl down.

When I stepped outside, I noticed something I hadn’t before. Every house on the street—every single one—had a vine growing near the base. Most people probably wouldn’t have noticed it. Just one thin strand curling around a pipe or sprouting from a crack in the driveway. But I looked closer. They all curved the same way. All spiraled in the same direction.

I opened my notebook and flipped back through the pages. My earliest maps had started warping. The ink was thicker now. The spirals are darker, fuller. The paper almost felt damp in some places, like the lines were still alive. Still growing. Even the ones I hadn’t touched were changing, reshaping themselves slightly when I looked away. The lines were converging on something. A center point I already knew. The priest’s letter said it always returns. He tried fire, salt, and prayer. All of it failed. His letter had survived. But he hadn’t.

That evening, while I sat at the kitchen table, I heard the voice again. This time I was fully awake. It didn’t come from a dream, and it wasn’t outside. It was in the room with me, just behind my ear. No warmth this time. No breath.

“Why would you do that?” Then silence.

But I could feel something beneath the house. Something scraping from underneath the floor boards. It wasn’t scraping the flooring though—the sound was coming from deeper in the earth. It sounded like grinding. Like two pieces of iron scraping against eachother 

I packed a bag. The letter. My notes. A flashlight. A map. I took matches. A knife. A jar of salt. I don’t know what I thought I’d need. But I knew staying here was no longer an option. The lines were crawling toward me now, not outward. Inward. Always toward where I stood. The spirals in my drawings had started looping into themselves like they were folding reality.

The well had been whispering. Now it was listening. And whatever was at the bottom was finally awake. I was going back. I had to. Not to stop it. I don’t know if that’s even possible. But I had to see it. I had to know what it wanted. Because I think it’s always known what I am. And it’s been waiting.

Part IIII

I returned to the edge of the pine clearing just before dusk. The woods were quiet—too quiet. The usual buzzing of summer insects and rustling of small animals seemed to have stilled. I felt like I was being watched, and I suppose in a way I was, because Seth was already there, sitting on a fallen log with his arms crossed and an expression somewhere between worry and disappointment. He stood as I approached, and I could see that he’d been waiting a while. “You’re serious about this,” he said flatly, not even offering a greeting.

I nodded, not slowing my step. “I have to go back. Everything leads here. I’ve seen the symbols, the vines, the way the cracks form in the house—they all converge. It’s not random. It’s real. I think it always was.” Seth stared at me for a long time, like he was waiting for a punchline that never came.

“You hear yourself? You’re talking about cracks and vines like they mean something. Like they’re some kind of sign. You don’t think maybe you’re just... seeing what you want to see?”

“It’s not what I want to see,” I snapped, more sharply than I intended. “Do you think I want to believe any of this? That I want to be haunted, sleepless, surrounded by symbols that keep growing every time I look away? You didn’t read the priest’s letter. You didn’t hear the voice. You didn’t see the flowers on your pillow at night.” Seth rubbed his face with both hands and let out a breath. 

“Jesus. I thought this would pass. I thought maybe if you just let it sit, it’d fade out like a bad dream. But you’re only getting worse. This is a suicide mission.”

“I’m not going to die,” I said. “Not if someone’s up here to help pull me out.” He looked away and shook his head, muttering something I couldn’t hear, then sighed.

“Fine. But if anything goes wrong, I’m pulling you up. No arguments. No excuses.”

“Agreed.” We walked to his house to grab some rope, not speaking much. There was tension in the air, the kind that didn’t come from fear but from resignation. I knew I couldn’t explain it well enough for him to understand. And he knew I wouldn’t be talked out of it. He fetched a long coil of sturdy rope from the garage, along with a flashlight and gloves. We each carried one end as we made our way back toward the clearing. The forest felt tighter this time, the trees leaning inward, the light dimming faster than it should have. We barely said a word the entire walk.

At the well, we paused. The stones looked the same, but I could feel something else—like the very air around us had thickened. The birds had gone silent. Even the insects had stopped. Seth tied one end of the rope to a heavy branch nearby, anchoring it securely, then looked at me. “This is your last chance to not be a complete idiot,” he said. “You sure about this?” I tightened the straps on my backpack and took a breath.

“Yeah. I need to know.” He tied the rope around my waist and gave it a few strong tugs, testing the tension.

“I’ll be right here. If you shout, I’ll pull. If the rope jerks, I’ll pull. If you’re quiet for too long, I’m pulling.”

“Understood.” I climbed onto the edge of the well and slowly began my descent. The rope held firm as I lowered myself hand-over-hand into the dark shaft. At first, it was just damp stone and the faint echo of my breathing. Seth’s voice drifted down after me.

“You good?”

“Yeah,” I called back. “About ten feet down.” The stones started to feel slick, and the smell hit me—moisture and rot, like wet meat left out in the sun. After another few feet, I saw small holes in the stone walls—perfectly round, about the size of golf balls. They were spaced irregularly, as if bored into the well after its construction.

“I see holes,” I called up. “They weren’t in the old construction. Maybe... something bored through.” “Don’t start speculating down there,” Seth called. “Just keep track of where you are.”

I nodded to myself and kept going. At around twenty feet, the stone gave way to something else—dark, reddish, and fibrous. It wasn’t just damp. It glistened. The texture shifted beneath my hands, pliable but firm, like hardened muscle. My flashlight beam caught threads of some kind of tissue running along the walls in spirals. The air got denser. Every breath was harder to take, like I was inhaling steam laced with copper and mildew.  

“I think I hit the bottom,” I lied. “Going a little farther.”

“Be careful.” Another five feet down, I saw a ring embedded into the wall—a full circle, maybe three feet across, made entirely of the same fleshy material. It pulsed, slow and steady, like the beat of a buried heart. And then I heard it. A sound like breathing—not mine, not wind—something deeper, heavier. Inhale. Exhaled.

I felt a gust of hot air from below. I jerked the rope. “Pull me up!” There was no response at first. Then the rope shifted, tightening. As I ascended, I passed the holes again, and something shot out—vines. Slick, fast, they darted from the holes and lashed toward my legs. I kicked hard, trying to swing out of the way, but more shot up from below. I screamed to Seth. “Vines! They’re coming! Pull faster!”

I felt the rope jerk violently. Seth was pulling with everything he had. As I cleared the edge of the stone section, the vines thrashed and whipped, lashing at my boots and legs. I was nearly out when I saw Seth’s face at the top, strained with effort. “Come on! You’re almost—” he started, then screamed.

A vine had wrapped around his ankle. He kicked at it, shouting as he lost his grip on the rope. I tried to grab his arm as I neared the top, but another vine coiled around his thigh and yanked. He fought, cursing, eyes wide with panic. I pulled at him, but there were too many—vines snaking from the well, wrapping his arms, his chest, dragging him toward the mouth. “Don’t let go!” I yelled, clutching him with both hands.

His grip slipped. I tried to hold on. I tried. But he screamed my name as the vines yanked him into the dark, his voice echoing down the shaft before it was swallowed whole. And then there was nothing. Only my ragged breath and the faint creak of the rope swaying.

I ran. I stumbled through the trees until my legs gave out and I collapsed against a moss-covered rock. I sobbed there for what felt like hours. I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t think. My friend—my only real friend—was gone, because of me. Because I believed in something I didn’t understand. Because I thought I could face it.

When I finally made it home, I climbed into my window and collapsed on my bed, still wearing the same dirt-streaked clothes, hands trembling. I didn’t sleep. I just stared at the ceiling, listening to the silence.

The police questioned me for days. I told them the truth, or at least a version of it. That we’d gone hiking, that Seth slipped. That I couldn’t reach him. They searched the woods, the well, everything. They found no signs of foul play. They found no signs of Seth.

The case was ruled accidental. A tragic fall. Maybe a cover-up. Maybe they didn’t want to know the truth. Maybe they couldn’t. His family stopped speaking to me. Friends from school distanced themselves. I became a pariah. The boy who got his best friend killed. I told myself I’d never go back. That it was over. But it wasn’t.

It’s been eight years. I’m twenty-five now. I’ve kept quiet. I’ve moved twice. I tried to live a normal life. But I never really escaped that clearing. That well. Not really. The guilt has followed me like a shadow I can’t outrun. I see Seth’s face in dreams. Sometimes I hear him screaming. Sometimes I see him staring from the bottom of the well, not screaming at all. Just watching

I’m going back. Not because I think I’ll survive it. Not because I believe I can stop it. I’m going back because I can’t live with what I did. Or what I didn’t do. Seth deserved better. And I think whatever’s down there knows that. Maybe it’s always known.

1mm39ap,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mm39ap/i_need_advice/,I need advice.,"I have been dating this guy (43M) for two years now. I recently broke up with him because he did something I found disrespectful but the truth is, I’ve been questioning this relationship for a while now. I am a single mom (45M) of three and he’s a guy that’s been on disability since his mid 30s. I’m not sure what his condition is but he told me it was caused by an injury and it has to do with his nerves (I believe the condition is called Neuropathy)
He was always up front with me about both his health condition and his unemployment condition and I felt this was not a deal breaker as he could support me in other ways (emotionally, helping around the house, just being there for me, etc)
We would hang out and he’d pay sometimes and I’d pay sometimes. He’d buy food for us to share and I always tried not to ask for much knowing his financial situation (for example instead of getting coffee and bagel, I’d just get the coffee). None of us have a car so we would just use public transportation to get around. He also just finished college and got his Masters Degree in Social Work. He has a daughter whom he shares custody of with the grandparents (his wife passed away due to drug overdose. He went to rehab and got himself clean. Due to these circumstances, he decided his daughter had a better chance at life being with the grandparents who are more or less well off) 
Everything was ok and my kids were ok with him and his daughter liked me. The past few months, I’ve been getting increasingly frustrated because he’s been home after graduating back in April and he’s been spending time just watching shows/movies and sending me YouTube Shorts while I am at work and this bothers me (we don’t live together btw). I feel like as a single mom of three, I should find someone that would add to my life instead of just becoming another source of stress and possibly financial burden. I’m not talking about a man that would PROVIDE everything but a man that would share expenses with me (except the kids expenses as I totally get they are MY RESPONSIBILITY and I never asked him to help me financially with the kids or anything else for that matter. He got them gifts when he wanted to, which I always appreciated)
I feel like he could be working doing something. I mean, it’s been years of him not working and I feel like some people just get used to being on disability. He also has a daughter and I feel that should be motivation enough to try to offer her better things/better life. He lives with two roommates and when she’s with him, she sleeps in his room on his bed and he sleeps on the floor). He has mentioned how working could impact his benefits but he also has expressed being ready to work as a social worker once he comes back from this upcoming trip to FL with his daughter. He also mentioned how social work is tough and will take time away from family and basically he will slave away. 
I’m not sure how bad Neuropathy affects someone’s ability to work. I try to be understanding but what do you guys think? Am I better off just being single? Like am I being unreasonable here? ",1,1754781533.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

At that appointment they had said I had 10 cavities across my mouth and made me schedule 3 appointments. They led me to believe I don’t take care of my teeth properly and they even gave me a prescription toothpaste. (Mind you, my last appointment I had 0) Well, after my first 2 appointments, my third one came. The first two appointments I had the same dental hygienist, but my third appointment I had a different one. The different hygienist had to file down areas that the first hygienist didn’t properly file, and they even had to redo a filling from the second appointment. Fast forward to today, I was taking a drink of my coffee when I felt some sensitive pain where my filling from the first appointment was done. (They only did one and put medication on two others during the first appointment) then, while I was eating I felt something hard and it looked like a whitish color and it was hard. When I got home and went to get a snack and drink, I felt more pain, checked the mirror and realized my filling was missing and that’s why I had pain. I have not ate anything hard to cause it to come out either. It literally just fell out and caused me discomfort. Now I have a hole in between my teeth. 

  
also, last time I went to this dentist in 2021(I switched after this)I had a dentist tell me I needed emergency surgery before I’m 16 or I’ll lose all my teeth. I turn 16 next May and haven’t lost any (my gum and lip are too attatched somewhere, but other dentists had said it was fine.

1mm335b,https://i.redd.it/jhce8b01t2if1.jpeg,My Last Wish: Leave My Life,"Chapter 1
On the tenth year of my marriage to Jadiel Gibson, my son struck me on the head with a trophy because Jadiel's first love didn't show up at the ceremony.
""Get lost! It's your fault Kelly couldn't be here!
""You're nothing but a manipulator using underhanded tactics. I can't imagine how many people you've tricked with those dirty schemes!
""Having you as my mother is my greatest shame!""
I stared at my son—his eyes filled with hatred, like he truly wished I were dead—and gave a bitter smile.
The trophy made a sharp noise when it collided with my head, leaving everyone in the lounge shocked.
But Oliver Gibson, my 12-year-old son, didn't even try to wipe the blood splattered on his face.
A sharp pain pierced the back of my head, yet I remained calm.
Maybe because I'd already gotten used to his violence.
The teacher trembled and took the weapon away.
""Oliver! This is your mother!""
Oliver didn't bother to look my way as I lay on the ground. With a chilly tone, he said, ""She doesn't deserve to be my mom!""
I rested against the teacher, my breaths shallow.
Still, I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palm.
With a hint of irony in my voice, I quietly replied, ""That's right. I'm not his mom.""
Just as Oliver was about to leave, he stopped abruptly. This sudden pause was even more frightening than when he'd struck me earlier.
With a swift motion, he knocked the glass figurine off the table, and it shattered on the floor.
The sound of breaking glass was followed by the slam of the door as he walked out.
I ignored Oliver, my gaze fixed on the pieces of glass strewn across the floor.
I spent three months crafting that graduation gift, testing over a hundred furnaces in the process.
It was the closest resemblance to Oliver.
This morning, I presented it to Oliver, hoping it would make him smile.
However, Oliver showed no interest. He continued to grumble about my insistence on attending the ceremony.
His comment had caused his beloved, Kelly Meane, to avoid visiting due to her suspicions.
I swallowed my bitterness, determined not to cry on his big day.
Suddenly, the sharp base of the trophy struck my head.
As I began to lose consciousness, a young girl rushed over.
She looked at me with disdain as I lay helpless on the floor.
""Quit pretending, homewrecker. Oliver said he was just giving you a lesson. He didn't even use much force.""
The teacher was taken aback and tried to scold her for being rude.
She pouted and looked at me with disdain.
""Oliver shared the surveillance video of that awful woman drugging his father in the group!
""My mom said that those who ruin other people's relationships are homewreckers!""
The child's blunt words pierced my heart like a sharp knife, leaving me breathless.
It felt as if my blood turned to ice in that instant.
That night, it was obvious that Kelly wanted to be with Jadiel.
I ended up sleeping next to Jadiel.
But when morning came, I was accused of drugging someone to advance myself.
Jadiel discovered the actual surveillance footage.
However, to protect Kelly, he created a fake video instead.
He directed all his fury toward me.
I used to believe that the injustices I endured due to Kelly were already overwhelming.
Yet now, even the child I carried for ten months and brought into this world despises me because of this.
The teacher assisted me in calling an ambulance.
As soon as it arrived, Oliver unexpectedly dashed over.
Without giving anyone a chance to respond, he pulled me off the stretcher.
My head struck the ground once more, and waves of sharp pain and dizziness overwhelmed my senses.
Yet, this physical agony was nothing compared to the emotional wound inflicted by the person I trusted most in the world.
""Quit acting! You're not dying. You just want to sabotage my graduation, don't you?""
The crowd was stunned by Oliver's heartlessness.
Yet, I lay there serenely, unaffected.
The teacher stepped in sharply. “No matter what happened, she brought you into this world! If she passes away, you'll never have a mother again!""
Oliver felt annoyed by the teacher's words.
He kicked me forcefully and yelled, ""She's been a scourge for thousands of years! It would be wonderful if she could truly die!
""If I get labeled as bad because of you today, I'll make sure to 'kill' you ten more times!""
Chapter 2
A blow struck my chest.
The sound of my ribs cracking was audible to everyone nearby.
A sharp pain surged through me, and as I opened my mouth, a spurt of blood splattered onto him.
Oliver recoiled quickly, his face twisted in a strange expression.
The nurse seized the moment to move him aside and quickly lifted me back into the ambulance.
However, as we reached the emergency room entrance, Jadiel's assistant halted us.
The assistant, visibly uneasy at the sight of me drenched in blood, hesitated before speaking.
Nevertheless, he mustered up the nerve to deliver the message. ""Mr. Gibson requests that you be reasonable and go back to apologize to Mr. Oliver.
""He plans to join Ms. Meane for the necklace shoot today and prefers not to be interrupted.""
The doctor bellowed, ""What kind of person prioritizes buying a necklace over a human life? We need to save the patient right away! Find someone who can sign the consent form immediately!""
I lay there with my eyes shut, and the subtle movement of my chest was the only sign that I was still alive.
With trembling hands, the assistant started a video call.
""Mr. Gibson, you should take a look at Mrs. Gibson's condition yourself.""
Jadiel was stunned when he saw me.
He hadn't anticipated that Oliver would strike his own mother with such force.
He exhaled quietly.
""Oliver has definitely crossed the line this time.""
As the words disappeared, a slender figure suddenly leaped into his embrace.
Right after, Kelly's upbeat voice chimed in.
""Are you on a video call with Oliver?""
She struggled to stand, and Jadiel instinctively wrapped his arm around her waist for support.
Even though he knew I couldn't wake up, the assistant guiltily adjusted the screen angle a bit.
Kelly gasped in shock and pressed her face against Jadiel's neck in fright.
""Oh my goodness! How did she get injured so severely?""
Jadiel explained it was due to an altercation with Oliver.
Her face immediately took on a strange expression, and she asked, ""Oliver is just a kid. How could he have hurt Pamela like this?
""Pamela, you're upset that Jadiel went to the auction with me. So, you're pretending, aren't you?""
Her voice went high, clearly implying she thought I was faking it.
The doctor lost patience and shouted, ""Who would pretend when their life is at stake?""
Jadiel's expression immediately turned icy upon hearing this.
""Most people wouldn't, but Pamela is quite adept at it!""
He ended the call and finally let the doctor treat me.
A single message came through.
""If you cause any delay for Kelly to bid on the necklace, I'll ensure your life becomes a nightmare!""
It's no surprise they're father and son—their threatening styles are identical.
Once upon a time, Jadiel had chosen me without a second thought.
He returned to the master bedroom, sometimes cooked meals, and even planned a trip with me, despite my lack of travel experience.
After spending nights together, he'd hold me close and speak in a deep voice.
""Pamela, I want to make things right with you. Let's have a destination wedding!""
I believed he would move on from the past and make a fresh start with me.
It wasn't until Kelly and I were abducted together that I understood Jadiel had merely concealed Kelly more deeply within his heart.
At that time, Jadiel had intended to sever all connections with Kelly.
When the kidnappers demanded he pick between us, he chose to rescue me for the first time.
But in a fit of rage, a devastated Kelly leaped off a cliff.
Jadiel remained at the base of the cliff for three days.
It wasn't until the kidnappers, unable to handle the intense questioning, accused me of orchestrating the entire scheme.
In a fit of rage, he slapped me repeatedly right in front of Kelly's grave.
""I can't believe I fell for your act of innocence! I even considered building a life with you!
""You murdered Kelly! I want you to join her in the grave!""
But then, everything changed.
Chapter 3
The doctor narrowly saved my life, but my time is limited.
""Multiple organ failure...""
Jadiel, who had rushed back, rubbed his forehead, frowning deeply.
""Pamela Harlan, I intended to forgive you after Oliver graduated.""
He gazed down at me, as though granting forgiveness was an enormous favor.
""Did you really have to cause such a scene today?
""If it weren't for Kelly persuading me to return, I wouldn't have cared if you survived or not this time!
""You're well aware you weren't in any real danger. Are you using this martyr routine to make everyone fault Oliver and put me in a difficult spot?""
Kelly gently patted his shoulder, a tender expression on her face, while Oliver held his waist tightly.
They stood beside my hospital bed, resembling a close-knit family of three.
I gazed at him, feeling a sudden clarity.
Jadiel's hatred wasn't solely due to my interference with him and Kelly.
To him, all my years of patience and admiration were merely deceitful acts.
Even when we were intimate and he seemed completely absorbed, he would always take an extended bath afterward.
He believed I had resorted to vile tactics to entice many others.
He despised me.
Every word he said felt like a dagger to the heart.
Tears that couldn't escape clogged my throat, almost suffocating me.
Noticing my silence, Jadiel's face became increasingly tense.
""Are you still questioning my relationship with Kelly?
""She's been having issues with Eric Hachett recently, and they're going through a divorce. I'm just there for her as a friend to offer support!""
Kelly's face momentarily stiffened, then she added.
""Jadiel has been honest with me. He did have feelings for me in the past.
""But now that Oliver has grown up, Jadiel has always expressed his desire to be a good father.
""As Oliver's mother, you can be sure he'll treat you kindly.
""Therefore, Pamela, you really need to stop doubting us.
""Constant suspicion really hurts Jadiel's feelings.""
Kelly's words sounded explanatory, but each one was meant to show she was closer to Jadiel than I ever was.
Unexpectedly, I chuckled.
Jadiel assumed I was warming up. He extended his hand, attempting to tuck a stray hair behind my ear.
""Don't dwell on it too much. Let's enjoy life from now on.""
In the past, I would have been moved by the unexpected warmth in his actions, hoping that someday he might understand my real emotions.
Now, I looked away from him in disdain.
Jadiel's hand halted in mid-motion.
Then he saw the fast pulse on the ECG monitor next to me, and his smug smile returned.
""Don't stay mad at Oliver. Remember, he's your child.""
Hearing that, Oliver tucked himself behind Kelly, purposefully avoiding eye contact with me.
""I want Kelly to be my mom instead!""
Kelly gave him a reassuring pat on the back, a helpless smile playing on her lips.
Her eyes fixed on me with a hint of challenge.
I replied casually, ""That's fine.""
Those simple words caused Jadiel and Oliver's expressions to shift suddenly.
Oliver's eyes turned red with anger.
""Oliver!""
Jadiel intercepted his hand before it could descend.
Looking at me with disapproval, Jadiel questioned, ""What kind of upbringing did you give him? He's so aggressive at such a young age!""
Furious at his attempt to deflect responsibility, I couldn't help but laugh out loud.
""Wasn't it you, his own father, who disregarded my life from the start?""
My typical patience and humility vanished, leaving Jadiel shocked.
Even Oliver was caught off guard by my response to Jadiel. In his confusion, he exclaimed without thinking, ""Have you died so many times your brain's scrambled?
""Aside from Dad and me, who else in this world would want you?""
At that time, Jadiel didn't want this child, but Kelly was completely content with the situation.
After all, having Jadiel's child would guarantee my place as ""Mrs. Gibson.""
Jadiel would despise me even more, and stay even more devoted to her.
I was even more reluctant than him to give birth to this child, conceived through coercion.
But my desires were never considered.
Despite yielding, I never gained their genuine respect.
Instead, I became someone they could easily exploit.
The lucky charm I had hoped would safeguard Oliver since he was born. He shattered it himself.
Well, let it be. This obligatory mother-son connection stopped then.
I was free of any remaining ties.
Chapter 4
Fighting back the stinging in my nose, I took a deep breath.
""Oliver, you hate me for giving birth to you without your consent and for not being the mother you hoped for.
""Do you think I wanted this?""
He opened his mouth, but had no idea what to say.
""But from now on, you won't have to feel annoyed anymore.""
My voice was soft, yet I poured every bit of strength into it.
I then turned to Jadiel, enunciating each word with earnestness.
""If there's a next life, I never want to see you again.""
Jadiel seemed stung by my gaze, flustered, lowering his eyes.
Tears finally slid down my cheeks, and the ECG monitor let out a shrill alarm.
Jadiel felt a deep emptiness in his heart, as though he had lost something important.
When the medical team hurried in to rescue me, Jadiel gripped my icy hand firmly.
Standing at the ward's entrance with Oliver, Kelly gently urged him, ""Jadiel, step out quickly so the doctors can examine her thoroughly.
""Pamela pulls this martyr stunt every time. She's not even afraid that something truly terrible might actually happen someday.""
As she spoke, Oliver's fists unclenched.
""Hmph! You're always using those cheap tricks!""
He dashed over, grabbed Jadiel's hand, and led him out of the room.
""Dad, don't let them fool you!""
Jadiel's despair faded, replaced by anger at being fooled.
He looked on with a cold stare as the doctors continuously pressed the defibrillator against my chest.
""I won't fall for it again!""
Then he turned around, picked up his son, and walked away.
Before departing, he made a point of loudly inviting Kelly to join them for dinner at home.
My mind started to fade, and the world around me fell silent.
I didn't know how much time had passed.
A voice I hadn't heard in almost a decade suddenly rang out loudly in my ear.
""There's a heartbeat!
""Pamela! It's Adam! Wake up now!""
***
At Gibson's manor.
Jadiel sat motionless on the couch for more than two hours.
In that period, the hospital called once.
Upon hearing the name ""Pamela,"" Jadiel promptly ended the call. Later, he just switched off his phone.
At dinner, he ate mindlessly until a sharp pain pierced his stomach.
""Did you add black pepper to this?""
Kelly appeared puzzled. ""Yes, I got it just for this. It tastes better with it.""
Jadiel was sweating heavily from the discomfort. He let out a dry laugh. ""I told you back in high school that black pepper upsets my stomach.""
Kelly responded with annoyance. ""It's been ages. I clearly forgot!
""Are you blaming me, Jadiel?""
Jadiel said nothing.
Indeed, she was Kelly, the woman he had spent half his life chasing after.
He would only treasure and safeguard her. How could he ever hold her accountable?
It was Pamela who always remembered his dietary restrictions and preferences.
Yet today, she had to have an outburst, and now she remained in the hospital.
Jadiel rubbed his stomach, feeling a bit frustrated that Pamela still hadn't returned.
He headed to the medicine cabinet to look for painkillers but came up empty-handed.
At that moment, Oliver approached and retrieved more than a dozen boxes from beneath the coffee table.
Jadiel frowned and asked, ""Why did you hide the medicine here?""
Oliver fidgeted with his fingers and whispered softly, ""The mean lady mentioned that her body has been in increasing pain.
""I didn't want her interfering with me, so I hid all of her medicine.""
Jadiel's pupils shrank sharply, and his entire body shook with emotion.
""Oliver! How can you behave this way toward your mother?""
In that moment, Jadiel remembered the earlier scene where doctors were desperately trying to revive me.
A foreboding feeling settled in his chest.
He hurriedly turned on his phone, and a text message appeared right away.
""Pamela was pronounced dead following unsuccessful resuscitation efforts at 2:00 p.m. today. Please come to the hospital promptly to claim the body.""
Jadiel felt a heavy thump in his chest, and his vision swam with dizziness.
Oliver exclaimed, ""No way! That can't be true!""",1,1754781064.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
