1g2636p,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyrtleBeach/comments/1g2636p/my_past_vacation_to_mb_reviews/,My past vacation to MB reviews,"We stayed at **Ocean Reef Resort**.  This was a 1 bedroom oceanfront room with a balcony.  The resort is VERY close to the ocean.  It technically has indoor and outdoor pools and jacuzzi's, but I didn't see any rolling doors to block off the outdoors during the winter.  Kitchen and fridge were smaller than expected.  Shower was really good with good water pressure.  Had a bar by the outdoor pool that was nice.  Overall I'd give it a 7.1 out of 10.

**Bimimi's** - Great food as always.  Just very fresh and homemade.  Very cold in the place though.  Service was great and a pretty good value if you don't buy alcohol.  7.8 out of 10

**Croissants Bakery -** Probably the best breakfast food on the beach.  They make such tasty food that isn't greasy and I don't know how they do it.  8.7 out of 10

**Landry's Seafood (Broadway)** - This was a solid lunch.  Not very busy with good service.  Very good clam chowder.  7.4 out of 10.

**44 and King -** Unheralded place on this subreddit.  Great atmosphere, service, food and drink.  A little pricey, but still reasonable.  I had the pot roast which was very good.  That may have been the best risotto I ever had.  I can't remember the drink my fiance ordered, but she really liked it and I took a sip and thought it was done perfectly.  9.1 out of 10

**Benjamin's Bakery -** Never disappoints.  Great pastries, bread and coffee.  Gotta get there early as they sell out of the bread quickly.  Always a must stop for me.  8.9 out of 10

**Aspen Grille -** First time going as I've heard so many good things about it.  Typically I stop at Thoroughbreds, but I wanted to try this place out instead.  I appreciate Thoroughbreds' atmosphere and bourbon selection more, but this is a fantastic place to dine.  Good atmosphere and they really roll out the red carpet for us.  Steak was fantastic.  It's not cheap thoug.  9.3 out of 10

**Blueberry's Grille (Grande Dunes Plaza)** - We ordered this to go and they kinda smushed my croissant sandwich and forgot to add cream to my fiance's espresso.  But the food was tasty and my fiance really enjoyed her Jungle Island Skillet.  This was a better performance from the Grande Dunes location than what we've had in the past here (the Barefoot location is excellent).  7.6 out of 10.

**Shuckers -** Really good ahi tuna and hushpuppies and oysters.  Service was great, drinks were pretty good.  Kinda surprised more people aren't there.  7.9 out of 10

**Tidewater Golf** - Good course in pretty good condition, but the round took 5-1/2 hours to play as a threesome because we had a group of 12 ahead of us taking forever.  Give it 5 years and the golf boom will die down because of BS like this and then golf courses will wonder why nobody wants to play golf for $200 a person and at a 5-1/2 hour pace.  We waited EVERY. SINGLE. SHOT.  I will never pay $200 to play that course again, nor would I pay $100 for that nonsense (not to mention the $$$ I paid for food and drink).  4.6 out of 10

**Asher Theater (Motown '59 Show)** - Typically we go to the GTS Theater for their Motown Tribute show which is excellent.  This didn't disappoint and it was a worthy competition between the two.  If I'm splitting hairs, I would say that the Asher Theater, from top to bottom, has better voices.  GTS Theater has a more intimate atmosphere and they do more history of Motown and do more 'group' singing (Four Tops, The Temptations, etc).  Both sides are so freaking talented.  The woman doing Gloria Gaynor...just fantastic.  The man with the higher pitched voice singing Smokey Robinson...incredible.  The Asher Theater has more room to dance which makes up for the GTS Theater being a bit more intimate of a setting.  I'd probably still go with the GTS Theater if I had to pick between the two, but I wouldn't be complaining about going to the Asher Theater either.  And I plan on going to both theaters again.  They are really great.  ",1,1728756569.0,MyrtleBeach,0,1.0,False

1g2611h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g2611h,The Time My Mom Got Petty Revenge On Her Neighbors For Calling Animal Control On My Dog,"Hi Charlotte! My dogs and I love your videos! 

So, this happened back when I still lived with my mom. She lives in a big house and in the backyard are the kind of fences you see on horse pastures (three planks and two posts) and because we owned small dogs, my mom bought chicken wire and set that up around the fence to keep the dogs from being able to get out. However, every time that it stormed, the backyards on our side of the neighborhood would turn into a swamp and destroy some of the chicken wire, creating small spaces that the dogs could get out in. Both neighbors were also Karens. 

There were 4 dogs total and 2 of them were mine. One is a 12 year old Chihuahua named Rocky and the other is a 3 year old Chihuahua and Golden Retriever mix named Eevee (pictured). The other two dogs are another Chihuahua who belongs to my mom and aunt Chihuahua Mix who belongs to my sister. They're all boys and they're all well trained. 

Eevee is a very friendly and adventurous dog. He likes to go up to people to get them to pet him and will chase people if they don't. He would never harm someone, though. Eevee would also leave the backyard to take himself on walks, but he would only do it if I was with him. So, if he left the backyard, I was always right behind him and could see him. 

I know I could have taken him out in a harness and leash, but he's a very sensitive dog and leashes make him uncomfortable and he will not go potty on the leash. It also took away his ability to play in the backyard with my sister's dog, who is his best friend. 

The point is that while he was outside, I always supervised him and stayed with him and could always see him. I am also trying to teach him to stop demanding people to pet him. 

Anyway, one day Eevee goes up to the neighbor's son and jumps up on his leg because he wants the son to pet him. The son then tries to run away on his bike but stops when I tell him to stop for a second so I can grab Eevee. I apologize and then immediately take Eevee inside so that way he knows that playtime is over. I did this every time that he left the yard. 

While getting ready for work, I hear a faint knock on the door and find a paper from animal control letting me know that they visited about my dog going off the property. I call them and the guy who left the note said that my dog shouldn't chase kids on bikes and that gave away which neighbor called and complained (pic of the note is the 2nd photo). 

I'm pissed, but I go to work, and when I get home, I come out to the backyard to greet my dogs and family, but as soon as I step out back, I see my neighbors. Now, I'm not a confrontational person and it's extremely hard to bring out my wrath. But my dogs are an exception to this. 

I cuss out my neighbors and argue with them and then my mom comes over to defend me. I told them that there was no reason for them to call animal control on Eevee because I was with Eevee and I immediately took him inside after I picked him up from bothering the son. The neighbors tried justifying themselves by saying that they're scared of all of our dogs because my sister's previous dog, a Pitbull, was aggressive and bit their daughter. Then my mom pointed out that because the Pitbull was aggressive, we got rid of it. Our other dogs are not aggressive. Eevee's growl doesn't even sound aggressive. 

Things do settle down and the argument does turn into a calm conversation and the neighbors claim they're going to get a fence. But my mom is still petty because they messed with and hurt her daughter and her daughter's puppy. They also kept Karening us. For example, when my brother's car engine blew up while it was parked in front of out house, our neighbors called the police and said we abandoned the car. There wasn't a rule against parking on the side of the street, in fact a neighbor across the street parked his truck and boat on the street. But despite us all having problems with our backs, the police made us push my brother's car into the driveway until we could get rid of it. They also called the police when my brother was celebrating his 18th birthday. They also called over our trash when the trash company took several weeks to deliver our trash cans. And when we tried to burn trash that was safe to burn to reduce our trash, they called the fire department on us. My dad used to be a fireman and my mom volunteered at the firehouse so she knew how to make a proper firepit and what trash was safe to burn and was following safety protocols. Our neighbors calling animal control on Eevee, who is the most adorable and sweetest dog you'd ever meet, was the straw that broke the camels back. 

So, the next night, I come home to my mom and aunt filling condoms (fun balloons) with lotion and my mom tells me that they're going to pull a bunch of pranks to teach the neighbors to never mess with us again. My mom pours corn syrup at the end of the walkway up to their porch to attract bugs. She then puts on all black and crawls to the husband's truck to toss the condoms (fun balloons) into the back to make it look like the husband was cheating (my mom fell and sprained her ankle while she was doing this, too, but she was dedicated). She then found the Karen's phone number and texted her to tell her that she slept with her husband. 

The neighbors respond by installing cameras that point at our house. My mom responded by going on our deck that morning in a robe and flashing the cameras and the neighbors. My mom usually enjoys her coffee in the morning in the gazebo under the deck in her pajamas. She never goes on the deck for this. She is absolutely unhinged. 

Needless to say, the neighbors finally left my family alone. And Eevee has improved a lot with his behavior issue of being too friendly. ",1,1728756398.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

We‚Äôre an opinionated bunch!¬† Most of the time I door knock, I‚Äôm taking notes of what I‚Äôm hearing and digest it later to better understand the themes.

**Here are the big constants I‚Äôm hearing:**

* The passion for this place is visceral, it‚Äôs hard to find someone that doesn‚Äôt visibly LOVE this place
* Street safety, particularly around speeding and getting things to 25 MPH is a near universal response
* Neighborhood safety is another concern, with large agreement that a fully staffed police department is critical
* Investing in beautifying our downtowns and filling storefronts is another thread (Bay Farm residents in particular want to see a vibrant shopping center)
* Housing often is the area where I sense some tenuousness, people get that we need to build it, but where and how it adds to traffic remain concerns
* Many want the temperature of City Council meetings to go down, and the collaboration to go up

Further below are some specifics and the neighborhoods I learned them from. I think it‚Äôs useful for all of us to understand what the vibe, hopes, and dreams are across the Island, and if I can help you better understand it, I feel like I‚Äôm doing one of the main roles of why I‚Äôm running: being a voice for all of you in this town‚Äôs direction.

To know something is to love it, and boy, do I love this place even more. I‚Äôm \*for\* you, Alameda.

**HARBOR BAY ‚Äî The paths and water ways here are an appealing mix! I walked a neighborhood behind Safeway**

* ‚ÄúEverything filters down from strong schools"" said one mother who raised her family in the AUSD system. She wanted to see teachers appropriately paid and able to live in town. ""Diversity of people"" was another critical element.
* Lamenting about the state of Harbor Bay Landing shopping mall was a constant I heard. It once was vibrant with a bookstore, coffee shops, ice cream and lots of restaurants. Now they're worried about the state of it and the vacant stores.¬†
* A former city employee raised to me the issue of the Oakland Airport Expansion, the noise and the night time air traffic and environmental concerns.¬†
* I met one of our former county supervisors who raised sea level rise concerns, particularly since many homes here share lagoon access.¬†
* A former AUSD school teacher wants to see respectful civility in our city meetings. She wants to see it such that kids can listen to our politics. ""Alameda is such a wonderful place, we have the capacity to do good here.""

**CHRISTMAS TREE LANE, East End ‚Äî AKA Thompson Ave. We sure take our holidays seriously in Alameda, and this street will soon have holiday lights up when the Halloween decorations go down:**

* Many would like a stop sign somewhere between the High Street Bridge and the light at Santa Clara to slow traffic down. And during the holiday season, they‚Äôd love some support for traffic management.
* ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a walker so I feel this \[speed\] often,‚Äù one elderly man said. ‚ÄúOnce a month I end up yelling at someone who drives into the cross walk while I‚Äôm walking it.‚Äù¬†
* Sustainability and funding / staffing the city‚Äôs Climate Action and Resiliency Plan (CARP)
* Concerns about petty theft in the neighborhood were repeatedly heard, but you could also sense that they wanted a right-sized approach to tackling crime.¬† Even a visible presence of police would help one said.¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a civilized society‚Äù and they wanted a just way of how we enforce crime, said one.
* ‚ÄúYou probably got my vote just because you came and talked‚Äù¬†

**THE POINT ‚Äì I did a stretch from the new buildings here, through Alameda Point Collaborative, on to former Navy Officer houses, and then to Storehouse lofts.** This area of town is one of the most diverse economically, many are recent residents in new apartments to others in supportive housing.

* ‚ÄúThe price of housing is very challenging,‚Äù said one Alamedan who moved from Ethiopia, we connected on his nation‚Äôs amazing food.¬† ‚ÄúHousing is what everything else is raised up from,‚Äù he continued saying that¬† ‚Äúeven with a median income its hard‚Äù
* An Alamedan playing his saxophone in the maker farm around APC.¬† We had a wide ranging conversation from safety to helping everyone in our community and he overflowed with positive vibes. Of expanding social services, ‚ÄúInvesting in people is never a waste.‚Äù
* I met an recently arrived Afghani and while we didn‚Äôt talk much since this was new to him, he was quick to offer a bottle of water
* One of my favorite conversations to date was with a couple that lived in one of the old Navy officer homes, they‚Äôve lived here for more than 20 years, and in many ways they reminded me of my in-laws. We ended up having a conversation for what felt like 20 minutes on their front porch talking about everything. The husband who served in the Coast Guard mentioned the huge potential of The Point, saying how well places like the Presidio show how to keep old military bases vibrant. They both wanted public safety attention out here. They also both thought that we should take advantage of the open spaces out here and keep them in good condition. While I think politically there‚Äôs some space between us, we connected as Islanders. Later, he found my Facebook page and wrote ‚ÄúThanks for stopping by the house tonight ‚Äì great conversation!¬† Hope we didn‚Äôt delay you too much‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt get many visitors üôÇ‚Äù

**PACIFIC AVE. ‚Äì I got my door knocking jitters out with my first walk here** with a new friend I made in the process of running, Doyle Saylor a tall Texan with a big heart who just happens to live on my block

* We did it mid-September and people were just beginning to realize that there was a City Council race
* This section is on a slow street.¬† Generally everyone liked it for its traffic calming, but didn‚Äôt like the plastic barriers. Most seem enthused to learn more about the permanent changes being planned for Neighborhood Greenways
* One colorful conversation was with a long time resident that moved from Oakland to Alameda for the safety and jobs here decades ago. He offered a key perspective about the importance of community ensuring that people can stay in their homes long term: ‚ÄúYou know what happens when you take neighbors out of the neighborhood? You get the hood.‚Äù

**MULBERRY ST. ‚Äì This is a newish development in my kid's school district. We have a lot of friends in my kid's classes that live here and they invited me out for an ice cream meet and greet**

* There are 52 different units here in a set of buildings that now sits where former warehouses are. The town-homes blend well with the surrounding neighborhood, reflecting Victorian, Mission and Craftsman styles that are seen around it.  The Alameda Preservation Society awarded this new development a commendation: [https://alameda-preservation.org/programs/table/1901-1969-mulberry-street/](https://alameda-preservation.org/programs/table/1901-1969-mulberry-street/)
* My friends remark at how much they appreciate the community they've been able to build after all these new units were built. This was place is packed with kids, and there are a couple streches where they have three kids that were born a day a part.
* The units spill into a shared lawn and common space where the kids play and they do summer movie nights, and is open to rest of the neighborhood as a public space.
* Housing, bike and public transit and safe routes to schools were critical elements they all wanted to see bloom in Alameda

**BENTON & CENTRAL, Central Alameda ‚Äî This area of Alameda is easy to love with its amazing diversity of beautiful buildings and styles**

* One renter underlined the importance of Renter Protections. He said a member of his family experienced homelessness and ensuring that people have the support of a safe stable place to live is critical.¬†
* One woman I met while she was gardening said with excitement ""I don't want to live anywhere else!"" and wants to ensure others can live here too, saying that with prices increasing on a number of fronts ""that wiggle room is no longer there"" for many
* I had a long conversation with a man who really appreciated the city's push against gas leaf blowers and wants to continue to see it enforced
* One lady said she regularly attends the community beat police meetings and found it a great way to understand safety issues. She said she had a family member leverage CARE and Village of Love services from the city and was ""very grateful"" that it exists to support this community
* Another is interested in more lively businesses later at night including live music.
* And one of my favorite moments... I knocked on a door, started to introduce myself to the man who opened it and he immediately said ""Stop, stop! I'm already going to vote for you! Go to the next door and tell them what you're about!"" ü§£

**AROUND EDISON ELEMENTARY, East End ‚Äî On a hot Sunday afternoon I walked around this East End neighborhood**

* A couple with grandkids said that they felt Recreation and Parks was over extended. They said the parks need better maintenance and wanted to see Sweeney Open Space completed before taking on new projects.
* A mother and her adult daughter wants slower traffic and see speed enforcement - ""people are going 47 in a 25!‚Äù.¬† They also wanted cleaner and nicer looking downtowns
* More affordable housing one, but ensure these developments are paying their fair share of property taxes
* Infrastructure improvements like road quality, especially after utility digging has occurred was another corner

**SEAPLANE LAGOON FERRY, The Point ‚Äì One Thursday morning a friend and I handed out my fliers to commuters heading to the city for work**

* A number of them underlined the importance of great transit like the Ferry (for obvious reasons)
* Keeping our nature clean and safe was one push I heard from a man who regularly does beach clean ups
* I want to underline that observationally it was so clear that many were walking and riding to this ferry point, showing that transit like this is taking cars off t

**THE BENTON, Central Alameda ‚Äî I met a bunch of Alameda politically and civic minded dads at this Central Alameda establishment**

* One is a life long Alamedan and his daughter and mine have been in the same preschool / class for the past 4 years.¬† He is worried about seeing friends leave Alameda because of cost of living and wants more housing and safe streets for his kids to get around
* Biking infrastructure is a big and popular discussion topic amongst many - and they wanted to see our continued expansion of the bike networks

But does caffeine ever make you guys nauseous?? I have always consumed large amounts of caffeine my whole adolescence and adult life, I‚Äôm talking 2-3 cups of coffee, 1-2 diet sodas and an energy drink. This is what I‚Äôve had most every day for the last 15 years or so. I‚Äôve struggled with chronic fatigue since I was about 13 and the caffeine was my way to combat that. I never really had any of these other POTS-like symptoms until I was much older (I maybe experienced pre syncope once or twice as a teen), about 28 is when I really started to notice myself getting dizzy upon standing and eventually I developed PVCs at 30. I never attributed this to the caffeine intake because my caffeine intake has always been this high (out of control if I‚Äôm being honest) and it was never an issue until now. I recently cut back, quit my daily energy drinks and if I have coffee at all it‚Äôs usually one cup in the morning after my Liquid IV. But prior to this I got really sick and was not having any caffeine for about a week just due to me not wanting to upset my stomach after just being sick for 3 days. It seems like now, after the brief hiatus from all caffeine, when I have it, it makes me incredibly nauseous. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs actually the caffeine causing the nausea or what. But I was wondering if this symptom specifically happens to anyone else? I had a rough nights sleep last night so I had a sugar free redbull this morning and man‚Ä¶I just feel awful today. I didn‚Äôt feel great when I woke up, but I feel extra bad now. I did feel pretty nauseous yesterday as well, and I did have two caffeinated diet sodas. I‚Äôm just curious to know if anyone else has experienced this?? 

Also, who do you all recommend to see to get a diagnosis? I have seen a cardiologist for the PVCs but he seemed to dismiss POTS, same with my PCP. Should I find a new cardiologist or should I think about a neurologist or maybe internal medicine?? 

I should mention, I think I have hyperadrenergic POTS specifically. I had a very traumatic childhood and a string of toxic and abusive relationships in my teens and twenties, I spent years 8-28 of my life in fight or flight. ",2,1728755754.0,POTS,2,0.75,False
1g25s8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1g25s8q/isnt_33_a_bit_late_to_be_questioning_my_sexuality/,Isn't 33 a bit late to be questioning my sexuality?,"I am a 33-year-old woman and I am also quite confused about my sexuality these days. It's been almost a year since I couldn't get one girl out of my head. I think about her in both ways‚Äîromantically and sexually.  Additionally, I've sometimes thought similarly about other women I know, just as I used to think about men (I'm talking about a girl from work or a girl from a local caf√© ‚Äî we are real people, not celebrities).

What confuses me even more is that, in the past, I've had only romantic and sexual experiences with men, who I still find attractive. But now, out of nowhere, there's a strong desire to experience this with someone of the same sex so much, so that I would figuratively speaking ""kill"" for it. It's like ""long-locked doors"" have suddenly opened, and these feelings that have been accumulated there over the years have come out like a rushing flood.

I mean, isn't 33 a bit late to be questioning my sexuality?

When I think about it more deeply, none of my relationships with men ever lasted long. While all of my friends sooner or later started imagining their weddings with their boyfriends, that was never something I did. The idea of a long-term relationship and especially marriage is terrifying to me. The truth is, I've never been in a relationship that lasted more than six months. Recently, I had the opportunity to start a relationship, but I took a step back when the time came. I also had a chance to have sex with a man and guess what, I made a step back, too.

On the other hand, once I started entertaining the idea that I might like women, it was as if a stopper in my head suddenly popped out, and all these thoughts started pouring in. For example, when I'm sitting in a caf√©, and the waitress brings me coffee, a thought just runs through my mind: ""She's sexy, I'd go for her,"" with the same meaning as if I had thought that about a man. These thoughts appear out of nowhere, completely naturally.

The truth is, in my sexual fantasies over the last six months, 90% of the time it's been women (especially that one girl I can't get out of my head). The funny thing is, I feel like I might enjoy it more with a woman in bed than with a man. On the other hand, I can say that sex with men is nice and I do enjoy it, too.

I don't know. I have been dealing with these thoughts for a while, but unfortunately, there is no one to discuss them with. I feel like I need to discuss or at least read about similar experiences, to better understand what the hell is going on right now.  The thing that probably surprises me the most (perhaps scares me a little) is the fact, it came out of nowhere. Somehow I can't trace the trigger of all this.

PS: I am sorry it's a bit too long, so many thoughts were there...

Disclaimer: Everybody is different. For me, I was up and down for the first month. The 2nd month was complete garbage. Then like clockwork, right around 60 days in, I normalized - energy and mood were like a normal person again. And it‚Äôs pretty much been that way since.

My energy and mood is stable throughout the day most days. That sounds normal but is a huge thing to say given that I was most definitely not stable throughout the coffee days. I‚Äôm way less anxious than before, generally and socially. I don‚Äôt get stressed as easily. I fall asleep within minutes most nights and don‚Äôt wake up like a bus hit me the night before.

I work an extremely fast paced, high stress office job. I know people try to justify not quitting because of similar work. It‚Äôs bullshit. I‚Äôm just as productive now, maybe even more so because I‚Äôm not crashing the entire 2nd half of the day. I‚Äôm also more calm of a leader because I‚Äôm less stressed and people tell me this frequently.

You don‚Äôt need caffeine because you wake up early. You don‚Äôt need it because you work out. You don‚Äôt need it to be more productive at work. I wake up at 5 or 5:30 most days, go to the gym and/or train BJJ (sometimes both), work 9 hours, then take care of my daughter until bedtime. I have energy for all of it.

Now my energy is dependent on how often I‚Äôm working out and how good or bad my diet is. I have low days, but it‚Äôs either because I stayed up late, ate a bunch of sugar or garbage food, or didn‚Äôt work out yet. I like this because it keeps me in line since I don‚Äôt have coffee to fall back on to mask my shitty energy, and because all of these things are pretty easily controllable.

I remember we were hanging out very late/early morning, and you were telling me the places you'd take me to in your town.

I remember you telling me about the nature walks and the little squirrels and birds you'd see there, then the conversation shifted over to faires I think? How you'd take me to one that happens there or near there. You'd tell me about the museums you wanted to take me to and the coffee places. I know I wasn't interested in concerts at the time, but it's something I'd like to do now.

I still want to take a visit up there, but I don't think I ever should. It's 8 hours from me so I'd make a whole trip out of it, but there's no point to without you. 

I know I shouldn't think of what could've been, especially since I'm the reason it got ruined, but I can't help it.

My boyfriend (35) and I (34) have been fighting, and I can't figure out why it became such a big deal.


Context
My boyfriend is very intense about time management and hates wasting time. He‚Äôs productive and punctual, seeing it as a sign of respect for others. That said, he does relax, and isn't like this 100% of the time. I respect his need for timeliness, try hard not to delay him, and keep it in mind when we‚Äôre together‚Äîthough I'm not perfect.
Another important thing to add is that this was a work day for both of us. We work from home and can mostly manage our own time, no need to do a typical 9 to 5.


What happened
So yesterday around lunch time he says to me ‚ÄòHey, I am going to the gym‚Äô.

I respond by saying ‚Äòah, I was also thinking of going now-ish, maybe we can go together?‚Äô (we often go to the gym together) and he agrees. I tell him I am finishing work in 15 minutes and will come downstairs.
I then come downstairs and suggest we have lunch before we go, because the gym is usually very busy at around midday, if we had lunch, this would mean we would be going a little later and the gym would be emptier. Also, we needed to have lunch anyway, either before or after the gym. He agreed to have lunch first.

After lunch, I went to the sofa to relax as I was feeling a bit off, and also to try to digest a bit before going to the gym. He sat next to me and was watching football on his phone.¬†

Then I suggested we get up and go to the cafe which is right next to the gym, we always have coffee after lunch so I thought this would be a good idea. It would get us moving towards the gym and we would get our after-lunch coffee.

After I said that, I was feeling low energy and possibly sick, this is why I wanted to rest on the sofa and also try to get coffee before going. I then expressed to him ‚Äòactually I maybe shouldn‚Äôt go to the gym today, maybe I could go tomorrow instead I feel exhausted‚Äô.

Then he got extremely annoyed, he started saying that I was disrespecting his time and that I was dragging him along. He got very pissed off in a way that, to me, seemed to come out of nowhere.
I get that I was slow, maybe annoying and too laid-back. But I only made suggestions he kept agreeing to. I never forced anything, and he didn‚Äôt say he was in a hurry until he got mad. He let me take the lead but clearly wanted things his way (which would have been fine), and didn‚Äôt say anything until his frustration boiled over.

As I said, sometimes he is chill, sometimes he is intense about time. How was I supposed to know this was not a chill moment? How could I be 'dragging him along' and 'disrespecting his time' when I literally only made suggestions.

I know I was probably annoying and oblivious‚Ä¶. but am I the asshole here?¬†",1,1728754592.0,AmItheAsshole,6,1.0,False

I recently got with someone in an intimate way. Before we got there he kissed me. Then asked me if I wanted coffee and I said yes. As he left to grab coffee my lip line started to swell up and I immediately got scared. He came back with the drinks and I asked to see his lips. There was a healed scab also I can tell he had on an ointment on. He never had that before. So I asked if he had herpes he said no and that it was just a cold sore. I didn‚Äôt feel itchy, tingling, or burning sensation from the kiss. We proceeded to get sexually intimate and used a condom ( we always have). He did give me an oral before the intercourse. And that worried me because my lips swelled after he kissed me so I can‚Äôt imagine down there. I got super anal and applied abreva to lips. I haven‚Äôt had any other symptoms besides my lips. So my question is, is this a sign of HSV-2? Should I be worried. He also had no out break and we used a condom. For his lips there were no scabs at all and fully healed. I did book an appointment to get tested but I just need to know if anybody else experienced this?

We all need an imaginary friend to help us go through the boring day in front of the computer... Let's be so for each other!

I am a 37-year-old, glasses wearing, grey-blue eyed, right-handed, cat owner, married, father of one, coffee drinker, 6 feet tall, French guy. I am a little nerdy, I try to be funny, and I am often ironic. Not only that, but I like reading, swimming, cooking, reading, ... (*not all at the same time*).

And I love to ask and answer questions, like ""*what color is your tooth brush*?"" (mine is purple), ""*how do you take your coffee*?"" (in large amount),  ""*Why can't donuts be square*?"" ... I just hope for nice, open, honest, funny and maybe a bit silly conversations with you.

If that interests you, I'm just waiting for your opening message!",1,1728754294.0,r4r,0,1.0,False

My bottom right with the purple band and the blue band feels janky and jagged.

I use a tongue scraper as well but my tongue is still a little white at the end of the day. I‚Äôve had a really bad experience with dry mouth and wake up several times a night to chug water but I still feel dehydrated. I cut out coffee and soda and snacks and crunchy and sugary foods. I eat 2x a day to cut back on the amount of times I need to reapply orthodontic wax. I also plan on getting mouth tape today for the mouth breathing at night. I‚Äôm worried that it‚Äôs tartar but I don‚Äôt want to have to go to the hygienist too often because it sounds already damaging to get my teeth cleaned each month? Or am I wrong? Should I switch toothpaste, or add non alcoholic mouthwash? I‚Äôm at a loss because im depleted by the first half of the day without caffeine or sugar. Is it tooth decay that‚Äôs just now being exposed? Or the extra mouth breathing at night? And last time I got my teeth cleaned was mid august.

We were supposed to meet at 1pm at a spot he picked. It wasn‚Äôt too far, so I decided to Uber there myself. He did offer to pick me up at a train station, but I had already made my own travel plans, so I politely declined. There was some traffic, so I ended up being about 15 minutes late, but I kept him updated the whole time.

I know it‚Äôs important to be on time, but from the moment we met, he came off as super arrogant and rude. When I arrived, he wasn‚Äôt where we agreed to meet. After messaging him, he said he‚Äôd be outside in a minute. As he crossed the road, he immediately started talking at 100mph, saying he didn‚Äôt want to waste time and that we should just go straight to his ‚Äòpenthouse‚Äô for drinks. He also asked if I had read his bio properly about his terms on SA. This felt really off since we hadn‚Äôt even entered the coffee shop, let alone sat down.

The kicker was when he said if I didn‚Äôt go with him, it wouldn‚Äôt work out because ‚Äòhe doesn‚Äôt like wasting time with small talk‚Äô and ‚Äòhas a high IQ‚Äô I KNOW! I told him I found the interaction weird and wasn‚Äôt comfortable going to his place without at least staying in public first for safety reasons (his and mine‚Äîlike, I could be a witch for all he knew!).

Then, he gave me a literal 5-second countdown to decide, right there outside! Obviously, I said no.

This was my first ever experience and it really shook me. I know it won‚Äôt always be like this, but can someone please tell me this was just a one-off bad experience? I almost cried afterward",8,1728753955.0,sugarlifestyleforum,25,1.0,False

After meeting I stopped replying to his messages and when he asked if I was disappointed, I just wished him good luck on his dating journey and blocked him.

The reason? Well, quite a few: 
1. He lied about his age, 31 in profile, then during the date admitted he was 37. I asked why lying and he just replied it was funny.
2. I offered to go to Starbucks for a coffee but complained that it was too expensive so I ended up changing the location to walking in a park. Not sure if this is a red flag, but it was the way he said it ""5 euros for a coffee? No thanks"".
3. He was overly critical and pessimistic during the date.

I‚Äôve had prostatitis like symptoms which started about 4 months ago. It started with a constant burning sensation around the prostate area. Especially painful when sitting and I also had bad lower back pain. Also some extra burn after urinating.

I went to the doctor and they did a urine test, which was normal. Doctor said I probably just had a non bacterial inflammation. He gave me some anti inflammatory meds and told me to see how it goes.
After about two weeks the issues were completely gone. No back pain, no burning. This lasted for about three months. I would occasionally feel a slight burning sensation there when I would drink a lot of coffee, drank alcohol or did heavy lifting. But most of the time I had no issues.

This week I drank a lot of coffee and did a some heavy lifting at work. The burning sensation came back. Not as bad as first time, but pretty constant. One time after drinking coffee, I went to pee and I almost fainted out of fear when I saw the last few drops were red. It wasn‚Äôt much but it obviously seemed like blood. Happened only once.

Next few days I quit coffee entirely, took some ibuprofen and took it easy a bit. Urine seemed either clear as day or very normal yellow consistently. Burning sensation has almost completely gone away again. 

I am still extremely freaked out about the little bit of blood I saw. I have an appointment on Monday with the Dr. But I am so very scared. I‚Äôm afraid it might be prostate cancer or bladder cancer. I read prostate cancer at a young age is pretty much a death sentence. My wife is pregnant with our second child and I really want to see my girls grow up. 

Do you guys think this might be something worse than prostatitis? 

One detail that might be important: I have been doing something stupid with masturbating ever since I was a teen. So for many years. I have been blocking my cum during ejaculation with my thumb to dump it in the toilet instead of it going everywhere. I don‚Äôt know why but it just seemed like an easy way to clean up and formed as a habit since my teens. Maybe I damaged my urethra/prostate this way?",1,1728753873.0,Prostatitis,0,1.0,False

Instead, she's outside enjoying a cup of coffee. She talks about wanting to travel with Reese and Kelli Copter and breaks the news that she has rehomed Odin, the dog she shared with Tony.   
  
Natalie says it's too beautiful of a morning not to be outside plus she wants to spend time with her daughter's dog. She tells her fans that they helped her get that dog out of the room she locked her into earlier this week by advising her to use a screwdriver on the doorknob.  
  
Natalie let Odin, the dog she shared with Tony, go live with Tony's sister. Natalie says Odin bonded to her and stopped crying when she was around. Natalie realized that the dog was depressed and she didn't feel right keeping him anymore, she says. She thinks this arrangement is better for him because she says she's not as passionate about having pets as Tony and her kids are.  
  
""He was 24/7 with Tony, and with me, he was not getting the attention that he needs,"" Natalie says. She says Odin obviously made the choice to go with Tony's sister.

I wonder how SPTV fans are going to react to Natalie rehoming this dog because many of them love animals so much. Marilyn helped turn a lot of fans against Amy Scobee months ago when she did an entire livestream implying that Amy hadn't told the truth about her foster dogs and that Amy had scammed fans into giving her toys and other gifts for the dogs.   
  
SPTV fans have probably given Natalie a lot of stuff for Odin too. After Tony died, Natalie did many streams where she was walking Odin or had him in the room. Fans got attached to Odin too.

""I love doing stuff with Reese too and we're going to be doing more together again soon,"" she tells a fan. ""She's one of the funniest people I've gotten to know in this community."" 

Natalie thinks it was hilarious for Reese to imitate the sheriff's officer she allegedly had on the phone a couple of nights ago about the guns Jeff says she stole. ""Who needs Netflix when you have Relatable Reese?"" she says. Natalie didn't tell her viewers that Aaron said Reese was genuinely concerned about getting arrested yesterday.  
  
Aaron, Natalie and Reese are working overtime to distract from the serious problems of the SPTV Foundation by doing these livestreams that look like they're above all of the controversy and they're just laughing it off. Natalie's trying hard to get better at roll call and reading her chat. She's left-handed and she says that makes it harder.  
  
Natalie says if she visits Reese, she couldn't stay with her because she's allergic to cats. But she'd like to do a trip with Reese. Natalie wants to go on a road trip with Kelli Copter next year too. Marilyn tells Natalie she has an Airbnb. Natalie says maybe they should go visit her.

Natalie doesn't think she's gotten any messages yet from the Scientology dating site that she joined. She says it's not user-friendly and she had to verify her email address. She must not have used her Life After A Cult email. ""I joined it because if people can be recruited into Scientology through dating and making friends with Scientologists, could I get people out of Scientology by joining a dating site,"" she says.

Natalie says maybe she should make it her mission to date Tom Cruise and get him out of Scientology.

In response to a chatter who says they'd like her to do a video with Nora, Natalie looks kind of annoyed and says ""I haven't done a video with Nora in a long time, but we shall see.""   
  
Natalie shaded the truth by saying that and she totally ignored the conflict that's happening. Nora has called Natalie out for participating in the ""cute-ification of Aaron."" Natalie actually just did a whole video with Nora on Aug. 17 that reviewed a video interview of Dr. Eric Berg and his wife, who are Ian's Scientologist parents. That collaboration was done just three days before Sterling resigned from the SPTV Foundation board. Natalie also did a livestream dedicated to the launch of Nora's GenXercise channel in August.   
  
Aaron hasn't wanted to do collaborations with Nora for a long time, but Natalie agreed to a bunch of them. Then when Natalie met with Aaron and Mike Brown to agree on SPTV's ""no more negativity"" mission statement, Natalie didn't even bother to call Nora to tell her about it.

Natalie asks for a volunteer to coordinate an SPTV glamping trip or a group meetup ""because if it's up to me, it's not gonna happen."" One of Reese's biggest fans immediately says she'll do it.

Another chatter says ""All of us in the Cult of Grifter Housewives will come."" Maybe that's a joke from Reese's Facebook group.   
  
Kelli asks Natalie if she lives near Yellowstone because going there is on her bucket list. Natalie says it's about an 18-hour drive from Minnesota, but they could get there.",6,1728753428.0,SPTV_Unvarnished,3,1.0,False

I got totally hooked on this so randomly, but I wanted to just share some thoughts of mine because hoo boy this is a whole different world from where I'm standing! 

1. I don't hate Whitney half as much as everyone seems to hate her here. To me it's clear as day she's  emotionally immature which I'm not surprised of AT ALL, considering her family was/is rather deep in this cult. And yes sorry I'm gonna call mormonism a cult because to me that's what it is. I can see how insecure and how she desperately wants attention and care from the others, and I kinda feel bad for her considering it all.

  
2. This is connected to point 1, I don't get why Whitney is made to be the ultimate evil in black and white, when all of them seemed rather two faced at times. Yes Whitney was a drama lama clearly, and her inability to apologise and consider others was maddening, but I thought pretty much all of them were some kind of shit stirrers at times. And I don't blame them for that per se.

  
3. What the fuck is going on with these rules, no warm coffee/tea but almost 2 liters of diet sodas is totally a-okay? Your body is a temple so no-no to tattoos but then let's get the everything special from the plastic surgeon, like, WHAT? Further proves my thoughts of this being a cult, because that's just insane. And that's just the surface level stuff, don't even get me started on those fucking garments or how women have to be called to heaven by a man, lol.

  
4. Jen, if you read this, girl, please go to therapy (like secretly and online if you have to??) and dig deep if this is what you want your life to be and more importantly, what your children will grow up to see and think is normal. It's obvious to everyone that Zac is rather abusive and it's clear from his family's reactions that the apple didn't fall far from the tree. And from your reaction you know it too, you just can't acknowledge it. And I get that too. Wonder where these girls could have been without this indoctrination??

1g24ral,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaturatedFat/comments/1g24ral/initial_mcdougall_diet_research/,Initial McDougall diet research,"McDougall diet is very interesting wrt to stuff like potato, emergence and other HCLFLP starch diets.  The reasons why they give their recommendations are based on a bit old info in some cases, but still pretty interesting.

* It's a starch centered diet.  It seems to count various beans & lentils as starch also.
* Wants you to avoid food processing, supplements and fortification as much as possible.  Even pushes you more towards brown rice vs. white rice even though it's marked as 'ok'.  Does not like refined sugars, bleached refined flours, etc and heavily discourages them.  This runs into the anti-fortification stuff you are seeing nowadays.
* Vegetables are good, but they say they are not calorie dense enough so make sure to eat enough starch still.
* Very soy limiting specifically. Says the fat from soy beans can be too much and you should limit it.  Also soy avoidant in a bunch of other ways that is pretty interesting.
* Avoids adding any kind of fat, so it ends up avoiding PUFAs way before anyone was talking about ""PUFA bad"" for a while due to this and avoiding food processing.  Doesn't matter if it's a coconut or butter, added fat is bad.
* As a result very nut / seed avoidant unless you want to gain or maintain weight.  Still wants it to be limited because of protein & fat.
* Protein avoidant.  Says once you have enough protein, the body tries to eliminate it through the kidneys.
* 'Max fat loss' mode in the starch solution says to do 45% starch, limit fruit to 10% and 45% low calorie vegetable and really avoid anything fatty like avocados which really matches the kind of composition I had with the potato diet + other small things that I made.
* Fruits are a 'garnish' and not encouraged to be a central item.  I'm guessing it's trying to avoid too much fructose also, another popular theory for weight loss and other metabolic issues.  I really like fruit, like most people like ice cream so it probably has legs for me.
* Was inspired by Kempner Rice Diet and the traditional diets of old Hawaiians about 40 years ago.
* Says to not put too much salt, and it seems to come from an angle of not overeating, or increasing palletability too much.
* The early 2010s book 'the starch solution' has coffee, tea and caffeine on it's ban list without much explanations, while the current website does not.  I guess they found that was too much for many, but you still notice this caffeine discouragement attitude with them.
* Definitely has some vegan ""credos"" interlaced through it, can be preachy at times. ""These days Westerners are running out of excuses for their gluttony.""
* Suggests some basic movement, especially after meals.
* Aluminum avoidant
* Diet seems effective to a point where they get questions about gaining weight enough to make articles like these ones: [https://www.drmcdougall.com/education/information/how-do-i-gain-weight-on-the-mcdougall-diet-im-not-joking/](https://www.drmcdougall.com/education/information/how-do-i-gain-weight-on-the-mcdougall-diet-im-not-joking/)
* Guy died a few months ago at 77, the r/exvegans subreddit said he was looking gaunt and acting erratic in the last few years of life. [https://www.reddit.com/r/exvegans/comments/1doayqd/dr\_mcdougall\_died\_at\_age\_77/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exvegans/comments/1doayqd/dr_mcdougall_died_at_age_77/)Many suggested we have an increased need for fat and protein as we get older and that could've been a source of issues.   If we ever get a 'postmortem' it will be very interesting.

Overall they get a lot of things 'correct' with what I've seen in the current twitter / reddit dieting zeitgeist as to what you should do, as much as you can get it right with many differing opinions.  Overall very interesting to get so much stuff aligned with something so old relatively.  I think a bunch of them were flukes, such as PUFA avoidance by fat avoidance, or fortification avoidance, and the starch stuff & other rules probably really working well with some specific genetic profiles and not with others like most silver bullet diet plans.  It seems like an amazing cutting diet overall, but not great for building muscle mass looking at the long term results of adherents.   Markus Rothkranz is the only long term vegan diet guru that I've seen that seems to retain muscle mass and looks healthy in older age, but I honestly haven't done much research into the vegan side.

I plan to probably start the diet tomorrow.  It's actually very compact and easy to research, not much reading material needed to understand it and probably will be the easiest prep wise since I can use a rice cooker and make beans.  Feel like I'll be a student again.

So I tested positive for e.coli in October 2022 and was diagnosed with acute bacterial prostatitis. I was prescribed Bactrim for a week, then doxy for three weeks. I eventually tested negative for the bacteria a month after starting antibiotics.

But my troubles weren't over by far. I had horrible irritation of the urethra near the tip, irritation of the meatus, pain in the perineum when sitting or sleeping on my side with my legs closed, and discomfort in the lower abdomen after ejaculation. This continued for six months after I cleared the infection, until April 2023. In one of my last visits to the urologist, he suggested I might have a pelvic floor dysfunction (CPPS) and referred me to a PT. But I didn't follow through as I moved out of the city and back to where I'm from (a rural area in the west) to help my aging parents.

Anyway, in May 2023, about 7 months after I cleared the infection, I felt almost normal and went on with my life. I had some slight irritation if I masturbated/edged too much, but mostly I felt ok. From last fall to last month, I did some remote work from a coffee shop in the small town near where my parents live, so I've spent many hours over many months sitting on hard cafe-style chairs.

Anyway, last week I was bored and masturbated and did a bit of edging by mistake. I've done edging off and on over the years but have cut it down due to its alleged impact on the *pelvic floor. After a session of masturbation that might have lasted a total of 40 minutes (I might have fapped around 25-30 minutes of that time) I felt a strange sensation while ejaculating. After that, and over the past week and a half, I started to get pain in my perineum when sitting, discomfort in my right testicle, increased urinary frequency, lower back discomfort, and increased post-void dribbling (which has been an issue since I had bacterial prostatitis but it has worsened the past two weeks). I've also had increased anxiety in general this fall as my job ended and I'm officially unemployed for now.

I saw my PCP the other day who did the manual exam and he said my prostate isn't enlarged but is a little soft. I also had a urinalysis that showed no infection, and I don't feel sick the way I did when I had acute prostatitis two years ago. with that in mind, my doctor recommended ibuprofen, sitting on cushions and softer surfaces, and light exercise. If this persists, he would recommend me to a pelvic floor therapist.

Anyway, I'm wondering what advice you guys have who have dealt with this shit before. If this is CPPS like I think it is, and I'm having a flare-up, should I try the stretches outlined for this condition and see if that and the ibuprofen plus the not sitting on hard surfaces help? This flare-up has really reignited the horrible anxiety I had when I tested positive for acute prostatitis two years ago.

I apologize if this post is poorly written. I'm sitting here dealing with anxiety about this. I'm supposed to go on a 12-hour road trip this coming week (6 hours Tuesday and 6 hours Wednesday) and I don't know if I can go if I feel like this.

**Julie Allard, CEO The Divine Crisis Management**

*Julie Allard's Apartment, Fell's Point, Baltimore, MD*

Julie rolled over when the alarm sounded and sighed in disappointment at the empty bed. Liam had been over last night, but he'd had a 4AM shift. She wished he'd woken her up when he got up to leave for work.

But that wasn't like him. Despite being an enormous mass of meat, Liam was a quiet, almost shy man. She had told him so many times to impose himself on her, but he still refused. He was a caregiver, not a taker.

She slapped the alarm to shut it off and sat up, stretching. She had a long day ahead of her. Slipping out from under the sheets, she stumbled naked out to the living room, where her phone sat on the charger. She'd had to stop bringing it in the room with her, because the constant notifications would keep her up all night.

Sure enough, the lock screen was full of notifications. After having taking the previous day off, she wasn't surprised. Most were from the DCM app, a heavily-encrypted social-media-esque program that helped members of the group stay organized and in touch. She flipped through the list, finding the highest priority messages, then froze when she saw them.

There were reports from the Blonde Bloc, the Raniers, Sookie, Emily Windham and the Local Resource Coordinator for the HQ, here in Baltimore. All said the same thing.

Jerry was back.

She ignored the rest, unlocking the phone and dialing her own personal hotline to the office. Her hands shook as she did, and she could feel the adrenaline coursing through her veins.

""Ma'am,"" the answer came after a truncated single ring. ""Did you see those reports?"" The familiar voice with that faint accent helped get her mind into business mode, even before her coffee.

""Just the summaries,"" she said, her voice hoarse without any coffee to lubricate it. ""please fill me in, Howard."" She padded into the kitchen and grabbed her bluetooth headset off the charger, connecting it and fitting it on her head before gathering up the accoutrements to make the ambrosia of the gods. As she worked, Howard, the intel officer on the other end, laid it out.

""Investigator Glenda Rainier filed the first report. Williams showed up as she was prepping several vampire prisoners for transport. He took over, stowing them in hammerspace, then teleported to where the other Investigator Rainier had just put one of the vampires down. He filed a report, as well. Both reports were corroborated by one filed by Captain Carter of Security Services, who interacted with Williams before he left. He dropped the prisoners off at the Clarke County facility, then vanished.

""An hour later, we got interim reports from two members of the Black Teams, saying that Williams showed up to their hotel in Erwin, Tennessee. They were deployed there to help guard the nuclear production facilities there, based on some intel. I can dig that up in a moment. Their report was that Williams appeared, greeted them, then left, giving little information on his activities.

""The Blonde Bloc filed another report, yesterday afternoon. Babs Nelson wrote that Williams appeared, helped her negotiate an agreement with the locals on a possible location for the proposed Indiana training site, then took off.""

""What about this report from the LRC here in Baltimore?"" she asked.

""Just filed this morning,"" he said. ""A gentlemen by the name of Nicholas Beaufort walked in to one of the satellite offices, provided an asset ID with a matching voiceprint, passed an aura scan, then informed us that Williams had appeared to him and... I guess his son, while they were getting dinner yesterday evening.""

""What did Jerry say at the dinner?""

""It's not here... Apparently he just greeted them somewhat awkwardly and then left. No details, Ma'am. Sorry.""

""It is all right. Have-"" she almost said 'Kathy', but then caught herself. ""Contact Sookie, have her reach out to Beaufort. They have some history, so she should be able to get the whole story out of him.""

""Yes, Ma'am,"" she heard him continue to speak, talking to someone else as he cupped the mic away from his mouth.

""I will be in the office in an hour,"" she said as the coffee pot finally filled up enough to fill a cup. She grabbed a mug from the cabinet and poured out her first portion. As she did, her trembling hand caused the bulging side of the pot caught the rim of the mug and jostled her hand, spilling coffee down her stomach in a hot wave.

""Pas sur ma bite, esp√®ce de pot stupide!"" she shouted, wincing at the sting coming from an extremely sensitive area. She quickly put mug and pot down on the counter, ran over to the sink and turned it on, splashing cold water on herself. The relief took longer than the pain to set in, of course.

Howard sputtered, and it was only at that moment that the faint French Canadian accent in his voice clicked in her mind. Her cheeks began to burn as she realized he'd understood her curses. Cursing herself silently this time, she drew in a breath to regain her composure.

""I am sorry, Howard. There was a... Mishap with the coffee pot.""

""I'm sorry, Ma'am,"" he said. Something in his voice sounded faintly of judgement and disgust and a flash of anger caused her cheeks to flush again.

She took a breath reminded herself that she'd interviewed him personally, and he'd known who she was and how she'd been born for some time. It wasn't him, it was her own mind justifying and deflecting from the embarrassment she felt.

""I will be fine,"" she assured him. ""It is more embarrassing than anything.""

""I once got hot grease spilled on me, uh... Down there. Couldn't use it for a month."" Julie smirked at his attempt at sympathy.

""That is not a problem for me,"" she said. ""Was there any more information about Williams?""

""We have monitoring stations reporting spikes in divine activity near three of his appearances that coincide with his presence. The full report won't be available until later, but it looks like he has upwards of five divinities.""

""Merde,"" Julie swore. She had known Jerry for years, and above all else, she knew that he had absolutely no desire to ascend to godhood. 

For most people, it wasn't a choice, really. A human being, even a demigod, trying to seize an entire divinity would get burned out by the power of it. A few had tried, most notably during the Battle of Ginungagap, when over thirty gods had been killed. None had survived.

But some people could. Jane, the Goddess of knowledge, was less than forty years old, she knew. She did not know the full story behind her ascendance, but she had heard that it had been quite traumatic, and a very rare and unusual set of circumstances. 

And then there was Jerry...

He used divinities like a soldier used body armor. Slipping them on and off as the need arose, as if it were nothing. As much as he might truly, deeply care about being just a father, husband and nerd, he had a facility with magic like nobody else Julie had even heard of. 

But for all of that, he hated it. He never kept any divinity longer than he had to. Even after he had worked out how to bundle them up and store them away, so as to continue living his life, he never kept any divinity longer than he absolutely had to. 

And now he had multiple divinities. This was not good. This was not good at all.

""I am getting ready right now,"" Julie said. ""Please gather as much information as possible and assemble as many department heads as are available for a meeting. We need to address this right away. And...""

She paused, thinking.

""Have Director Johnson attempt to make contact. They are friends. And reach out to the Church of Yarm, to see if we can get in touch with him, as well.""

""I sent Maryann out to check on Yarm's wife already,"" Howard replied. ""That's usually the best way to get to him.""

""Good. I will see you soon.""

""Yes, Ma'am.""

Julie hit the button on her headset to disconnect and went back to pouring herself a mug of coffee. She was much more careful, this time.

**Ava ""Nightingale"", Former Avatar, Goddess, Freedom Fighter, Current Librarian**

*Guilliman City, People's Republic of Norakesh, Sixteenth World*

Ava smiled as she handed the books over to the patron. ""Be careful with that pyromancy. It's easy to get burned.""

The patron, a teenage girl with the look of someone who might try to use said pyromancy on some of her bullies, blushed and nodded. Ava slipped into the girl's mind and found the emotional center. She stroked sensations of calmness, self-consciousnessand chagrin, as gently as possible, then slipped back out. The girl didn't notice and left with her tomes.

Hopefully, she wouldn't hurt anyone. Ava knew plenty of ways to have a good time with pyromancy that didn't involve anyone getting hurt. At least not on purpose. Fire had a way of getting out of hand. But the girl had her Arcane Practitioner's License, and it listed a hundred hours of evokation on the back. She should have enough experience to avoid any serious mishaps.

 Ava sighed and glanced around. It was late at night, past the library's normal closing time. She waited until the girl stepped out the door, then came out from behind the counter and locked up. All the normal closing duties had been done already. She was now alone.

She reached out mentally to Luke. No words, just an acknowledgement. A little emotional push, that it was finally time. Then, she walked through the aisles, winding her way through the labyrinthine ground floor of the repository until she found the door marked 'Employees Only' and pushed through it.

A storage area was half crammed with boxes containing books and other media. Many of the books were backups of their most popular titles. Others had yet to be catalogued for public offering. Boxes of zip cards held movies and broadcast serials, because the human need for fiction was universal. Optical chips held lectures and music, all of which would be catalogued and added to the library's servers, where patrons could freely access it.

But she wasn't here for those. 

Instead, she wound her way through this much smaller maze, quickly reaching a loading dock and a large, metal garage door. Next to it was a more typical door, bedecked with warnings about alarms sounding if it was opened without a key. She fished the electronic key out of her pocket and touched it to the sensor, then pushed the door open.

Luke stepped inside immediately. She could tell from the look in his eyes that he'd be wanting a hug and a kiss, and soon, but he restrained himself. On his heels, six more figures slipped in. As the last crossed the threshold, Ava pulled the door shut and turned to face them.

Right on cue, Luke wrapped her in his arms. Their lips sought each other out, and she took a brief second to let her heart melt a little at the touch before pulling back.

""I though she'd never leave,"" Luke said.

""I think she's being bullied, and wants a way to fight back,"" Ava told him.

""I could sort that out for her,"" he replied, a mischievous sparkle in his eyes. Ava grinned. ""I made sure she wouldn't be in the right mindset to go seeking revenge. At least not for a while. But if she's being really threatened, at least she has the tools to defend herself.""

Luke nodded. He'd been staring into her eyes since the hug began, and she almost lost herself in the depths of his. But she couldn't. At least not now. They had work to do, so she turned away. Luke let her go.

""Come on, I'll show you where it is,"" she said.

She led the group through the library again, to the lifts that hovered them up to the third floor, where the museum was. In this world, museums and libraries had merged many years ago, and were considered one and the same. The second floor was given over to the reference collection of the subject this particular library specialized in; magical weapons. But the third floor was reserved for researchers, academics and officials. Those who needed greater access to the artifacts housed here than the general public.

""Where did it come from?"" Alice Morrison, one of the group asked as they moved.

""An expedition to the Thirteenth World,"" Ava explained. ""They were excavating some ruins in Evonia when all of the magic started to go nuts. That's when they found it.""

""And now you have it,"" John Butcher, another one of the group said.

""And now I have it,"" Ava agreed. ""This library is the preeminent facility in the nation for magical weapons. There was no way it wouldn't end up here, once the government wizards had a look at it.""

Alice chuffed a laugh. ""The wizards in this world have no idea what they're doing.""

A round of agreements ensued. All of the group, except for Ava and Luke, came from the Seventeeth World. The only world to survive the War of the Gods. The only world, other than this one, with a significant human population left. The world from which the creator of this artifact originated. Better known to its inhabitants as the Material World.

""I think ye'd best be carrful aboot underestimatin' th'wizards 'ere,"" Liam O'Connor said, his thick Killarny accent coloring the words in a way Ava found pleasant.

""Kissven will let us know what their report says as soon as they present it to the Ministry of Defense,"" Luke supplied. ""Until then, let's not assume they didn't learn everything we're going to learn. The magic here may not be as obviously sophisticated as it is in your world, but they've been doing it for a very long time. Their best wizards are generally on par with your own.""

""Show me the Sixteenth World's version of Jerry Williams and I'll believe it,"" Alice deadpanned as Ava unlocked the door to the secure room.

Luke didn't respond. Truly, he had no answer to that. Nobody had a wizard on par with Williams. Ava remembered him as she'd first met him. A nervous boy, not yet a man in any meaningful way. Terrified at the naked woman in his bedroom. She remembered the gentle, intelligent, curious and creative mind she had once fallen in love with.

And then she remembered him the way she'd last known him. Soaring through the air under the power of his own magic, dogfighting and winning against a full flight of jet fighters that would have flown circles around and shot holes through anything his own world had to offer. He'd even made a point of saving one of the pilots. And he hadn't even broken a sweat.

""Not a fair comparison,"" Nelson Waters added. ""Williams is a fucking prodigy. We're unlikely to ever see anyone at that level for a long time. I mean, what are the odds that someone with that level of talent would be alive when magic returned to our world?""

""Not a coincidence,"" Ava said.

""Huh?"" John asked.

""Not a coincidence,"" Ava repeated. ""Just you reversing the cause and effect. How many people do you think called out to me- to Sarisa, while sacrificing knowledge over the millennia the gods slept through? Thousands. Jerry's call was simply the one worth heeding.""

""Jesus,"" Alice muttered. 

""Welcome to playing in divine politics,"" Luke said archly. ""It's like an orgy in a depression ward. Everybody gets fucked, and nobody's happy about it.""

Ava opened the safe and took out the wooden box. It was inscribed with dense runes, twisting and twining around, binding the incredible magics inside, keeping them from interfering with the magic around them. Keeping them hidden and safe.

She placed the box down on the table in the middle of the room and carefully unlatched the brass latches that held it closed.

""This is it,"" she said, her voice betraying a sense of awe as she opened the box.

The magic rushed out, making everyone's hair stand on end. Her brain tickled in response, a reaction somewhere in between that encountered by seeing the object of her lust, and seeing a crouching tiger in the bushes ahead of her. 

""Doesn't the DCM have guns capable of the same thing?"" Alice asked. Next to her, Nelson nodded.

""Yeah, but the magic is much cruder in those. This works off similar principles, but is far more sophisticated. And powerful.""

""I can tell,"" Alice replied, her eyes glued to the artifact.

Liam leaned forward and touched it. ""They say 'tis powered by the soul of a dead god,"" he said.

""It is,"" Ava confirmed. She eyed the artifact herself. The blade was made of a dark, smokey gray steel, with a bright, razor-sharp edge. The base of the blade had been masterfully worked into the shape of a fanged skull wearing a deep hood. Etched along the edge were the words 'Cognoscere hostem tuun,' or 'Know thy enemy"". Faux cracks spread out from the skull, making a lightning pattern that ran across the entire length, glowing with a faint, barely-visible red light. The guard was scrolled in ornate patterns, and there at the round pommel was the most telling feature of all.

A little bow tie.

I just laughed it off, like ok weird compliment. The next time I see him, he starts making small talk with me. I mention I work in politics and he asked a political question that actually really interested me, so I chatted with him for a few minutes about politics.

I‚Äôm looking to upgrade my Bambino Plus (currently paired with a Eureka Specialita). The main frustration I have with the machine is the lack of temperature control. Right now, I can reliably dial in most medium roasts but there is the occasional bag on the lighter end of medium that I feel the machine cannot handle very well. I drink lighter roasts when using pour over or our aeropress and I‚Äôm wanting to experiment in this area with my espresso. Between my wife and I we pull between 3 and 6 shots a day (30% of those being milk based) and host the occasional brunch requiring \~6 back-to-back lattes. I also want a machine that is going to last, hopefully for a decade plus.

The three machines under consideration are the ECM Mechanika Max, Profitec 600, and Profitec Move. Unfortunately, my local dealer is sold out of the Move and might get more in February, but no guarantee. I can get a Max with flow control shipped from a non-local dealer with a bottomless portafilter for $2130. I can get the 600 (no flow control) from a local dealer for $2400 (about at the top of my budget). One extra consideration is that the width of the 600 (12 in) is pushing the limit of my space, possibly to the point where it could disrupt workflow and the Max is 1.2 inches smaller.

Before folks start down the HX vs DB debate, after watching Lance Hendrick‚Äôs reviews of both the Max and Lelit Bianca, it seems his main gripe with both machine‚Äôs temperature stability is more to do with the E61 group head than the internals of either machine which would also affect the 600. I‚Äôve read most reviews on reddit and other coffee forums and people seem very pleased with the Max‚Äôs temperature stability and reliability. 

I am currently leaning towards the Max because of its size, rotary pump (potential to one day plump in and less noise), and that temperature management on a E61 will likely be similar between a DB and this smart HX machine.

Do folks have any other recommendations or hot takes? Should I wait for a Move or will I one day want to upgrade to something with flow control? 

TLDR:

* 3-6 shots a day (30% milk based)
* Wanting to experiment with lighter roasts
* Unsure on the usefulness of flow control in my routine
* 12 in max width, which is already pushing it
* ECM Max with flow control ($2130) OR Profitec 600 ($2400) without OR take a gamble that the Move is available by February ($2000)",1,1728752222.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Most guys are on dating apps and on average get between 0-1 matches a month if not every 3 months. Because of this they develop a sense of resentment towards dating apps and also women. Little do they know that if they go outside, they have a way higher chance of meeting women and finding a partner in as little as 2 weeks. I literally met a girl on the way to grab some coffee and all I did was open my mouth and talk to her about coffee, then she became my gf for some time. 



 The issue with this is that most guys would rather fight the algorithm on the dating apps day in and day out hoping for a girl that they can match with and even pay money for but they don't know that just taking 20% of that time to practice their social skills could get them a date so much easier. With that being said, get off the apps and go outside, talk to women and touch grass( I met a girl at the park last week which I was touching grass and reading my book, she came up to me and asked about my book).",3,1728751924.0,ApproachingIRL,0,1.0,False

I wanted to do that for him, every meal. I struggled with all the things everyone talks about: guilt, self-shame, frustration‚Ä¶ going back to work when baby was 3months I got into the groove of pumping before I left for work, 3 times a day a work (10hour days) and once at night. I took fenugreek. I ate lactation bites/cookies. Tried to stay hydrated. All while being away from my baby for so many hours. I felt like whatever little milk I could provide I should; only really producing 10-18oz. A few days the star aligned and I got like 6/7oz in a session. 

He is finally passed the 6 months mark that I was aiming for. I went down to two sessions a day of pumping- once at work and once before bed. Stopped the fenugreek a while ago and still getting 3.5-4oz, a nice snack.

I kinda like being able to provide him a beneficial snack. I like that I have a designated room at work. No one else pumps so I have an L shaped couch, a nice lamp, coffee table and side table.

I still have a ton of milk storage bags, lacatation cookies- can I continue pumping twice a day for an extended period of time or is it not recommended? Can I still only pump twice a day and go back to eating the lactation cookies? Or is that just making myself super uncomfortable?

My ride was a wonderful 4 mile lollipop loop on what would could be called double track. It isn‚Äôt what we call mountain biking these days, and it wasn‚Äôt paved or graveled. My area has more of this type of riding but a city xbiker might have more paved surfaces, coffee shops and errands they can loop in on a ride, it‚Äôs all good.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00-19.30. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

Okay, this began as a small comment on this subreddit with me being a dummy but has slowly leaked into every part of my mind. i made a crazy long post explaining what got me to this point then deleted it so I'll just stick to the extreme basics this time.

I fell in love with my best friend probably about 2 years ago. As a 22-year-old guy who's never even kissed a girl as of currently writing this, I was just happy this girl was even speaking to me. so fast forward to now, the only thing real about ever being in a relationship with this girl are the fantasies in my head and my dream bubble finally popped recently when she went on a coffee date with a guy. Obviously, this doesn't mean they're happily ever after but I'm not stupid in not understanding we're never meant to be. and I don't want to just sit on the sidelines as I watch my DMS and meet-ups slowly dwindle to nothing and I'm left alone.

at least those were the exact thoughts going through my head to force me into installing Tinder right after she told me she was going to be seeing this guy. so fed up with a fantasy gf I began swiping honestly thinking this was going to go horribly but things never turn out the way you expect it. and on my first day, I matched with a girl after mindlessly swiping. honestly, I wasn't sure about her she was okay looking and that didn't bother me as an also only okay looking guy but she seemed very tomboyish which was honestly not what I ever imagined my first relationship would look like. but she also had tonnes of cute pictures of her animals on her profile which hooked me. but in full honestly, I went into this conversation with the intention of ""Ahh this is the first match I've been slightly interested in let's see how far I can get with this""

and I can't describe how painful it is to me now to have gone into it with those intentions because she was a very sweet girl. we talked about our cats and honestly, we really bonded over this as we both seemed to be major animal lovers. after that, we moved on to talking about her life and that's when I became confused.

I'm a nerdy guy who spends most of his days indoors playing games and watching anime with my only active side being forcing myself to the gym with the hope of a girl one day looking at me and not saying ""yuck"". the rest is dedicated to my education at the university and simply surviving.

she however is a Muay Thai champion with green belts in two other martial arts and a passion for football both as an activity and sport. above that, she has a collection of wonderful animals which she obviously puts a lot of time and care into as one of her special needs cats should have been dead 5 years ago. its only when it comes to the last part that I get properly scared. She is the same age as me and isn't in education or work due to mental health problems which doesn't bother me as I've also had troubles but I'm terrified as a guy with zero relationship experience that I would be a horrible fit for her.

i wasn't sure about this girl but i kept it going even after I decided I was too scared to pursue this to the point where we got to talking about first-date locations. this is where I finally decided to try and end this in the most immature way possible. i shared honestly every possible negative about myself from me being a 5 foot 6 virgin all the way to the fact of having a dead brother. but nothing made her run and she even shared her own struggles back letting me into intimate details that people that have only known each other for 2 days probably shouldn't. but i was a coward and after leading her on a little further I ended it by saying I ""wasn't ready for a relationship"" ending with a block.

since then I've surfed Tinder and haven't seen or spoken to anyone with a fraction of the interest I had in her or had that interest back. honestly, it's been a week and a half and there hasn't been a day I haven't thought of her since it happened. i feel like we live 2 pretty different lives and were both a little messed up in the head but I got her Instagram before I got blocked and I'm thinking of messaging her. I'm just terrified I'm only into this girl because I'm hurting from my best friend's rejection and I'm desperate and can't get anyone else which isn't what I want because I think this girl deserves better. i just don't know if I should let her go or give it another shot because i don't want her to just be some rebound.

### Training



I'm a 37-year-old male who finished my first marathon in February with a time of 4:27:xx using a hal higdon novice plan. Lots of my reading on here pointed me towards the Pfitz plans and I settled on trying the 18/55 plan for my next block leading up to this October marathon. I used the Months of March-May to build up my mileage to 50ish miles per week. All easy miles, just focused on building weekly mileage with no injury! When June came I started the Pfits 18/55 plan. The first several weeks actually were less mileage than I was used to running, which was good because the plan immediately introduced me to the threshold runs and marathon pace long runs. I live in Texas so compounding this is 90-100 degree days by about 10am, so it was crucial for me to get out early. Even still, I found my paces to be quite stagnant throughout the summer with this plan. I thought it would be great to run sub 4 as an early goal target, and 9:00 even pace was my marathon pace for most of the summer.



Twin Cities Marathon is known for it's elevation gain towards the end. So I created a route for my long runs that would include a 2 mile stretch of uphills more drastic than what the actual race would contain. This destroyed me for most runs. I often had to stop and walk in the TX heat, or call my wife to come pick me up as soon as the hills were done because it was just brutal. This piece of my training would prove crucial for the actual race!



Once I got to the speed preparation phase, it was like my whole world of running changed. I had never before gone to a track, or done any sort of interval work like that before. I had to come to this subreddit a lot and search for exactly what I was supposed to be doing. But I figured it out and fell in love. Running fast is FUN! Running fast HURTS! Oh my gosh it hurts! But then I'm done and I feel SO GOOD. I don't know how else to describe this, but the adaptations that this phase of the training plan made to my body felt like I was becoming a superhero. I saw muscle tone and definition, my resting heart rate decreased, my easy runs became faster at the same zone 2 heart rate. And then I approached my first tune up race 10k with permission to run it all out and ended up on the podium, 3rd place overall (it was a small local 10k, but my kids thought I was an olympian) with a time of 47:58. Reading these subs helped me know I could plug that number into a Vdot calculator and see equivalent race times and I was shocked to see a 3:40:xx time pop up. I thought there was no way something like that would be possible for me.



As September came my area of Texas experienced a ""false fall"" where the temps cooled down dramatically into the 50's and 60's. I flew through my runs that week and began to understand the phrase: ""Summer miles bring fall smiles"". I had a marathon pace run that week of 12 miles where I decided to drop the pace down even further to 8:45 and see how it felt, and it felt great. I started to wonder if a 3:40 was truly within reach, or if I was being too ambitious about the gains. I closed out the block with another 10k tune up race of 46:00 and decided I would try for the 3:40 time. Vdot was telling me 3:32, runalyze had my marathon shape prognosis at 3:31, so I thought 3:40:00 would be a great ambitious learning experience.



I had a one week stretch about halfway through of significantly lesser mileage due to family vacation, and a week of illness due to respiratory infection that knocked me down. In the moment I was really concerned about this, looking back it seems not that big of a deal.



### Pre-race



I arrived a couple of days before the race and explored the expo for a little bit, enjoyed a shakeout run on with some strides, and started carb loading. I'm not a huge eater so for me this meant focusing my meals around carbs more (noodles, pasta, rice, etc.), trying to snack in between (cookies, chips, breads), and add in some liquids (gatorade, non-alcoholic beer).



My plan had me doing a 4 mile run on Saturday, but I felt like a walk instead so I enjoyed the brisk Minnesota morning and spent most of the day off my feet relaxing and chatting with family. In the evening, I laid out all my gear and got all my breakfast items out and ready to go.



Morning of I woke up at 4:30 (race start is 8am), slammed 16 oz of water, ate peanut butter and honey toast with fruit juice, 12 oz of coffee, and then hit the bathroom. I arrived on site at 7am. Plenty of porta potties and everything was well spaced out. I found my corral and jogged, skipped, and haphazardly moved my legs so I could look smart and fit like everyone else around me was doing :)



### Race



I'm fairly certain I was blessed with the best marathon weather I might ever experience. 49 degrees at race start, 50's throughout the race, decent tailwind most of the way. Absolutely perfect weather!



My fueling strategy was to use Gu Roctane every 35-40 minutes, with water at an upcoming water station. In training runs I couldn't get my gut to handle it every 30 minutes without feeling too heavy, but 35-40 seemed to work. There were a couple of times the timing didn't work out great and I had to wait a mile or so between the Gu and the water station, but it didn't bother me. This strategy worked great and my gut handled it well all the way to the end.



My plan was to go out with the 3:40 pace group and see how I felt at the last 10k. The corral filled up pretty tight and I got separated from the pacer when I went to discard my outer layers in the donation bins. Lots of fence hoppers from other corrals I noticed happening, right up to the gun. I had the pacer sign in my sights for the first mile, but only just. It had me a bit anxious because I didn't want to start out too fast, which I've noticed through race tune ups definitely happens to me every time. My nerves were further compounded because I'm quite sure my gps was messed up during the first couple of miles in the city. My watch logged the first mile at 7:25, but there was still a good .2 miles away from the first mile marker. This made me feel uncertain about my pacing, but I tried to breathe and calm down and make it a goal to catch up to them by the 5k mark, no sooner.



There was a small bit of elevation leaving Minneapolis, and my heart rate climbed a bit during this time, but settled down as I caught up to the 3:40 pace group right around the 5k mark. The fans were great and the entire course was filled with encouragement, fun signs, and people cheering for every racer, not just waiting for their own family! So fun!



Between 5k-10k I started pulling away from the pace group, I wasn't out of control, but each mile I looked back and saw them a bit further behind. I felt my splits were rather even so I didn't stress out about it too much. I thought I might just end up coming in a bit before them. That ended up not being correct as 10k-20k my pace trended quicker with a slight net downhill during this stretch as we got closer to the Mississippi river. My effort felt easy, and something I would be able to sustain long term. When I noticed some sub 8:00/mile splits I did have to consciously pull back. It took a lot of discipline as I was feeling really good, but in the back of my head I knew the elevation increase on the St. Paul side was coming and I needed energy for that.



Once you get on the St. Paul side of the Mississippi, Miles 20-23 is about 200ft net gain of elevation, with 100 of that straight up Summit Ave. from Mile 21-23. This was my crowning moment of the race. My long run training route contained a 200ft elevation gain towards the end, so I had months of wrecking myself in TX heat on a final hill during the long run. I hit this moment strong with the goal of not slowing down. Indeed mile 21 and 22 stayed consistent, 8:08 and 8:09. Mile 23 showed a bit of a slow down at 8:20, but I felt and looked good. The fans were electrifying at this section which helped so much, and at one point on this hill I heard: ""WOW \[my bib number\]!! YOU LOOK LIKE YOU JUST STARTED! GO WIN YOU CRAZY ANIMAL!!"" Flying by all the people who slowed down to walk was really motivating, especially when I noticed a few people who went flying by me earlier on in the race.¬†



When I reached the top of the hill, I got a bit emotional remembering this point in my first marathon when at the 24-mile mark I promised I would never do this ever again. I found my wife at this point in the race and I said: ""Oh my gosh I feel so good!!"" The rest of the way is downhill towards the capitol. I allowed myself to pick it up and see what was left in the tank. It was brutal on my quads, but the crowds were stacked on each side and absolutely roaring which gave me so much inspiration. Furthermore, I saw on the finish line the gun time showing 3:35:00 as I was getting close, which made me realize if I really push it I might come in with a 3:34:xx time! So I hoofed it across smiling and feeling strong! I just completed my second marathon and did it was grace and strength!



### Post-race



First marathon I nearly vomited and couldn't get any food down for awhile. This time, I gladly ate the banana, the beef stick, the chocolate milk, and everything else they handed me. I found my family and did hugs and pictures and heard my 3:34 time and couldn't believe it! 3:40 felt like a stretch, but I crushed it!



I smiled the rest of the day, enjoyed all the food and accolades from family at a cookout on that beautiful day, and just enjoyed the victory!

People around me are so amazed by my problem-solving skills and my ideas to make things happen but the problem is the execution. I'm just unable to execute any of my ideas. Even if I start it gets left in the middle. 

I don't know what needs to be done anymore, I lack the discipline to find a job that would pay my bills nor am I able to get a bank loan of any sort, and on top of that none of my businesses are making me any money. So yes, I'm completely screwed and there is nothing anyone can do about it.

1g23lu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aquarium_Unicode/comments/1g23lu9/the_last_light_reflections_on_the_final_moments/,The Last Light: Reflections on the Final Moments,"In the space between heartbeats, 
in the pause between breaths, 
there is a moment‚Äî
infinitesimal, yet vast as the cosmos.

This is where we linger,
on the threshold of being and non-being.

The room is white. Or is it? Perhaps it's the absence of color, the stripping away of perception as the senses slowly shut down. The ceiling‚Äîif there is a ceiling‚Äîseems to pulse. Breathe. Or is it my own breath I'm seeing, externalized in this liminal space?

I remember a field of wildflowers. When was that? Yesterday? Fifty years ago? Time loses its linear quality here, at the edge of existence. The purple petals wave in a breeze I can no longer feel. My mother's voice calls from somewhere beyond the flowers. ""Come in now,"" she says. ""It's getting dark.""

But it isn't dark. Not yet.

Synapses fire in cascading patterns, 
a symphony of electricity and chemistry,
playing out the final movement 
of a lifelong composition.

Each spark a memory, a thought, a dream‚Äî
some long forgotten, now vivid as yesterday.

The taste of salt on my lips. The sea? No, tears. Whose? Mine? Yours? In this space between spaces, the boundaries blur. I am you and you are me and we are all part of something greater, something we've forgotten but are now, finally, remembering.

A door creaks open in a house I lived in as a child. The floorboards groan under invisible feet. I know if I turn the corner, I'll see... what? Who? The anticipation hangs in the air, thick as fog. But I don't turn. Not yet.

Time stretches, elastic and forgiving.
A lifetime contained in a moment,
a moment expanding to eternity.

Is this what they mean by ""life flashing before your eyes""?
Not a chronological replay, but a simultaneous experience‚Äî
all that we were, are, and could have been,
coexisting in a single point of infinite density.

The scent of lilacs drifts by, carrying with it a fragment of conversation.

""Do you remember‚Äî""

But the rest is lost, scattered like dandelion seeds on the wind. Does it matter? Perhaps the remembering is enough. Perhaps it's all we have, in the end.

Light shimmers at the edges of vision,
not fading, but intensifying.
Is this the tunnel they speak of?
Or merely the brain's last, spectacular display‚Äî
neurons firing in jubilant celebration
of a life lived, now coming to its close?

I feel a hand in mine. Warm. Solid. An anchor in this sea of dissolution. I try to squeeze back, to acknowledge the connection, but I'm not sure if my body responds. Does it matter? The intention is there, and perhaps that's enough.

In the distance, a clock ticks. Each second stretches, becomes more elastic. Tick. Pause. Tick. Pause. The spaces between grow longer, until...

Silence.

But in that silence, a whisper.
A continuation of thought,
of being,
of...

What comes after the ellipsis?
An ending?
A beginning?
Or merely a change of perspective?

In the final fading of consciousness,
as the last synapse fires its ultimate spark,
there is a moment of perfect clarity‚Äî
a recognition of something
vast and incomprehensible,
yet intimately familiar.

Is this death?

...awakening?

The boundary blurs, becomes permeable.
Past and future collapse into an eternal now.
I am here, and there, and everywhere.

A child's laughter echoes from a sun-dappled garden. My laughter? Your laughter? Does it matter? The joy is real, tangible, a golden thread weaving through the tapestry of existence.

Faces appear and dissolve:
a stern grandfather, softening into a smile
a first love, eyes bright with possibility
a stranger, passing on a crowded street, 
now somehow significant.

Each a story, a world unto itself,
infinitely complex, infinitely precious.

The weight of regret settles like a stone in the pit of my stomach. Words unspoken, paths not taken, love unexpressed. But here, in this liminal space, even regret transforms. It becomes a teacher, a reminder of the preciousness of each moment.

If I could reach back through time, what would I say?

""Live. Love. Forgive. 
It's all so brief, yet eternal. 
Each moment a universe unto itself.""

But perhaps I am saying it, have always been saying it, will always be saying it. Time loses its tyranny here. All moments coexist, interpenetrate, inform each other.

The scent of coffee drifts by, rich and comforting. A Sunday morning, sunlight streaming through half-closed blinds. The rustle of newspaper pages. A comfortable silence shared. Was it yesterday? Will it be tomorrow? It is now, always now.

Pain flares, bright and insistent,
then fades, like a wave receding from shore.
The body remembers its fragility, 
even as the mind expands beyond its confines.

I feel myself stretched thin, spread across countless moments, countless lives. I am the child skinning her knee on the playground. I am the old man feeding pigeons in the park. I am the mother cradling her newborn. I am the soldier, the poet, the farmer, the king.

All of humanity flows through me, 
a river of consciousness, 
of shared experience.
We are one, and we are many.

The light grows brighter, or perhaps it's my perception that sharpens. Colors I've never seen before bloom at the edges of vision. Is this the brain's last fireworks display, or a glimpse of something beyond?

A voice calls, familiar yet strange. 
""It's time,"" it says. 
Time for what? 
To go? To stay? 
To become?

The question hangs in the air, unanswered. Perhaps unanswerable. Does it require an answer? Or is the asking enough?

I feel myself letting go, 
not with fear, but with curiosity.
What lies beyond the known? 
Beyond thought, beyond memory, 
beyond self?

The light engulfs me, or perhaps I engulf it. The distinction seems meaningless now. I am the light, and the light is me. We are all light, all energy, all consciousness, playing at being separate.

And in this final moment of realization,
of unity, of transcendence,
there is peace.
There is love.
There is...

The ellipsis stretches, becomes a bridge
between what was and what will be.
The last synapse fires, 
a spark leaping into the infinite.

And then...

Silence. 
Or is it?
Listen closely.

There's a hum, barely perceptible,
the cosmic background radiation of being.
It thrums through everything,
connecting, sustaining, transforming.

I am formless now, boundaryless.
No longer constrained by flesh and bone,
by time and space.
I am everywhere and nowhere,
everywhen and nowhen.

Memories float by like soap bubbles,
iridescent, ephemeral.
I reach for one‚Äî

A first kiss, clumsy and sweet,
tasting of cherry lip gloss and nervousness.
The memory expands, encompasses me.
I am there, I am then, I am that surge of emotion,
that quickening of pulse.

But also, simultaneously:

I am the lip gloss, the chemical bonds of its molecules
I am the air between our lips
I am the firing neurons, the rush of hormones
I am the cosmic dust that makes up our bodies
I am the story of that moment, told and retold
across countless universes

All perspectives exist at once,
a kaleidoscope of infinite possibility.

Is this death? Or a new kind of living?
Perhaps the distinction is meaningless here.

A thought forms, not in words but in pure concept:
What if death is not an ending, but a rejoining?
A return to the source, the primordial consciousness
from which all individual awareness springs?

The thought ripples outward, creating new realities.

I see:

A child being born, taking its first breath
A star exploding, scattering elements across space
A poem being written, reshaping language
A species evolving, adapting to new challenges

All connected, all part of the same cosmic dance.

Time folds in on itself, a M√∂bius strip of eternity.
The beginning is the end is the beginning.

I understand now, or perhaps I've always understood:
Death is not a period, but a comma,
a pause in the ongoing sentence of existence.

The light shifts, refracts, becomes everything and nothing.
I am dissolving, or perhaps coalescing.

In this moment between moments,
this space between spaces,
there is a choice to be made.

To hold on or to let go?
To remain or to become?
To end or to begin anew?

But even as the question forms,
I realize: there is no choice.
There is only flow, only change,
only the eternal dance of being and becoming.

I let go. 
I hold on.
I end. 
I begin.

All at once, all the same.

The last spark of what I once called 'me'
merges with the infinite,
a drop returning to the ocean,
yet somehow retaining the memory of its journey.

And in that final moment of transition,
of transformation,
there is neither joy nor sorrow,
neither fear nor courage.

There is only...

acceptance.
understanding.
peace.

The circle closes.
The cycle continues.
The light fades.

Or does it brighten?

In the end, in the beginning, in the eternal now,
it's all the same.

A breath.
A pause.

All recipes always use at least 14 or 15g of coffee. What is the best method for brewing small doses like 7 or 8g?

- I found very little information here, but what I found is that V60 might underextract. 
- Mugen should be slightly better due to lower bypass. 
- Hario Switch seems like a very good option because of the immersion part. Only temperature might be a problem, even after preheating. 
- Aeropress (inverted?) appears to work for the same reason (immersion). 
- What about Hario Switch + Mugen? Combining the immersion mode of the Switch with the low bypass and better temperature (plastic) of the Mugen. ",1,1728749582.0,pourover,5,1.0,False
