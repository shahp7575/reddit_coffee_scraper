1jlisis,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1jlisis/when_i_finally_woke_up_everyone_in_my_town_was/,"When I finally woke up, everyone in my town was dead, and they had been for a long time. That said, I wasn't alone. (Part 1)","Honestly, I’m not sure what woke me up last night.

Noise didn’t pull me from sleep: no whining of the hallway floorboards under heavy footfalls, no clicking of the bedroom doorknob as a hand twisted it, no groaning of the door’s metal hinges as it creeped forward. To put it more simply, I don’t think *they* woke me up. They were present *when* I woke up, but they didn’t *wake* me up.

It was more like my unconscious body was on a timer.

When that timer ticked down to zero, my head and torso exploded upright in bed, eyelids snapping open like a pair of adjacent window blinds with an anvil attached to their drawstrings. My bedroom was nearly pitch black, save for the faint glimmer of moonlight trickling in from the window beside me, but the pallid glow wasn’t potent enough to illuminate beyond the boundaries of my mattress. As my pupils dilated, widening to accommodate larger and larger gulps of the obscuring darkness, the only noise I heard was the raspy huffs of my own rapid breathing. Otherwise, it was silent.

I went from a deep, dreamless sleep to being uncomfortably awake in a fraction of a second. The transition was so sudden and jarring that it caused a wave of disorientation to ripple across the surface of my skin like goosebumps.

Once my vision adjusted, familiar contours began to emerge from the darkness, and my hyperventilation slowed. The gargantuan wooden armoire opposite my bed. A puddle of dirty clothes accumulating in the room's corner. The slight circular bulge of a wall mirror beside the open door.

Despite the growing landscape of recognizable shadows, my disorientation did not wane. If anything, the sensation intensified. Sitting up in bed, still as the grave, I felt my heartbeat become rabid, drumming wildly against the center of my chest.

*When did I go to sleep? How did I get into bed?*

*What did I do yesterday? Or what was yesterday’s date?*

*Why can’t I remember….?*

Those unsettling questions spun repetitive circles around my mind like the petals of a pinwheel revolving in a gust of wind, but their momentum didn’t generate any answers. Instead, their furious revolutions only served to make me nauseous, vertigo twisting my stomach into knots.

*Maybe a bit of light will help.*

I slid my legs out from under the covers and reached for the lamp on my nightstand, the soles of my overheated feet pleasantly chilled as they contacted the cold hardwood floor.

Before my fingers could even find the tiny twist-knob, I detected something across the room. Paralyzed, my hand hung in the air like a noose. I blinked, squinted, closed and re-opened my eyes. I contorted my gaze in every way I could think of, convinced I was seeing something that wasn’t actually there. Unfortunately, the picture didn’t change.

A human-shaped silhouette stood motionless in my bedroom’s entryway. The figure seemed to be watching me, but I couldn’t see their eyes to be sure.

Automatically, my hand rerouted its trajectory, drifting from in front of the lamp down towards the baseball bat I stored under my bed. The rest of me attempted to match the figure’s stillness while keeping both eyes fixed on its position, as if my stare was the only thing that would keep it locked in place. I felt my fingers crawl along the belly of the metal bedframe like a five-legged tarantula, but they couldn’t seem to locate the steel bat.

Sweat beaded on my forehead. More nervous dewdrops appeared every additional second I endured without a weapon to defend myself, my hand still empty and fumbling below. I wanted to look down, but that choice felt like death: surely the deranged, featureless killer looming a few feet from me would pounce the moment my attention was split.

*Where the fuck is it?* I screamed internally, my focus on the inanimate specter wavering, my eyes desperate to look down and find the bat.

*It should be* ***right*** *there,* ***exactly*** *where my hand is.*

I lost control, and when my head started involuntarily tilting towards my feet, I saw the shadow-wreathed intruder turn and sprint away. My head shot up, the loud thumping of a hasty retreat becoming more distant as they raced through the first-floor hallway.

*“****Hey!****”* I shouted after them, apparently at a loss for anything better to say. Once the word exploded from my lips, I felt my palm finally land on the handle of the bat. It was much deeper than I anticipated.

As soon as I had pulled the weapon out from under the bed, I was rushing after the nameless figure.

\- - - - -

In retrospect, the fearlessness behind my pursuit was undeniably strange. Which is not to imply that I’m a coward. I think I’d score perfectly average for bravery when compared to the rest of the population. That’s the point, though: I’m not a coward, but I’m certainly not lionhearted, either. And yet, when I was running down that hallway, my plan wasn’t to burst out the front door, fleeing to a neighbor’s house where I could call the cops.

No, I was *chasing* them. Recklessly and without a second thought.

I found myself hounding after the faceless voyeur through my completely unlit home in the dead of night, going from room to room and clearing them like a one-man SWAT team, with only a weathered bat for protection. Startled and riddled with adrenaline, sure, but not scared. Even when I came to find that the electricity was out, flicking various light switches up and down to no avail as I searched for the intruder, my psyche wasn’t rattled.

The dauntless courage was inexplicable, discordant with the situation, and out of character. Its source would become clear in time. For those few minutes, however, I was all instinct: intuition made flesh.

Subconsciously, I knew I wasn’t in danger.

Not from anything *inside* my house, anyway.

\- - - - -

No one on the first floor: living room, kitchen, downstairs bathroom, all vacant.

No broken windows. No front door left ajar. No visible tracks in the snow when I briefly peered into my front and backyard.

No one on the second floor, either: guest bedroom, workshop, upstairs bathroom all without obvious signs of trespass. That said, by the time I was clearing rooms on the second floor, I had begun to experience an abrupt and peculiar shift in my state of mind: one that made my investigation of those spaces a little less vigorous, and a lot less through.

Somehow, I became drowsy.

No more than three minutes had passed since I launched myself from bed, bloodthirsty and on the hunt, and in those one hundred and eighty seconds I had become deeply fatigued: listless, disinterested, and depleted of adrenaline. When I reached the top of the stairs, I could barely keep my eyes open. I felt drained: utterly anemic, like a swarm of invisible mosquitos had started to bleed me dry the moment I left my bedroom.

Of course, that made no sense. There was a high likelihood that whoever had been looming in my bedroom doorway was still inside. Still, I wasn’t concerned. That ominous loose end hardly even registered in my brain: it bounced off my new, dense layer of exhaustion like someone trying to pierce the side of a tank with a letter opener.

I poked my head in each upstairs room and gave those dark spaces a cursory scan, but nothing more. It just didn’t seem necessary.

Satisfied with the search effort, I trudged back down the stairs, yawning as I went. Twenty languid steps later, my heels hit the landing. With one hand gripping the banister and the other scratching the small of my back, I was about to turn left and continue on to my bedroom, but I paused for a moment, absorbed by a detail so unnerving that it managed to break through my thick, hypnotic malaise.

I furrowed my brow and looked down at my hands.

*Where the hell did the bat go?*

I didn't remember dropping it, but the concern didn’t last. After a few seconds, I shrugged and started walking again. Figured I left it somewhere upstairs and that I could find it in the morning. Which, to reiterate, was a decision wholly detached from reality. As far as I knew, there was still some stranger skulking around my home with unknown intent.

The idea of *dealing with it in the morning* stirred something within me, though. As I proceeded down the unlit hall, all of those other questions, the ones from before I noticed the figure in the doorway, began gurgling back up to the surface.

*What did I do yesterday morning?*

*Or last week?*

*Where is everyone?,* though I wasn’t sure who *“everyone”* even was.

It was disconcerting not to have the answers to *any* of those questions, but, just like the bat, they felt like problems that would be better dealt with after I got some sleep. I was simply too damn tired to care. That changed as I stepped into the open bedroom doorway.

I stopped dead in my tracks, stunned.

Somehow, the intruder had slipped past me. Now, they were lying on their side, under the covers, chest facing the wall opposite to the door.

Asleep.

Before that moment, my exhaustion was a shell: rigid armor shielding me from the sharpened tips of those unanswered questions. The shock of seeing *them* in my bed cleansed my exhaustion in an instant, flaying my protective carapace, making me vulnerable and panic-stricken.

*What…what is this?* I thought, wide-eyed and rooted to the floor.

The figure let out a whistling snore and turned on to their back. Moonlight from the window above my bed cast a silvery curtain over their body, illuminating their face with a pallid glow. I felt lightheaded. My brain fought against the revelation, working overtime to concoct a rational explanation.

An oddly shaped, wine-colored birthmark crested over the edge of their jaw, which made their identity undeniable.

It was me.

And I was currently frozen in the *exact same* spot the intruder stood when I jolted awake.

The figure exploded upright. The motion was jerky and mechanical, more akin to a wooden bird shooting out of a chiming cuckoo clock rather than anything recognizably human. They stared straight ahead, and because my bed was positioned in parallel to the wall opposite the door, they hadn’t seen me yet. I couldn’t move. Mostly, paralyzing disbelief kept me glued in place. But some small part of me had a different reason for staying still.

I could move, but I *shouldn’t*.

It wasn’t time yet.

Eventually, they swung their legs around the side of the bed, reached to turn on the lamp, stopping their hand only once they saw me.

My mind writhed and squirmed under the fifty-ton weight that was the uncanny scene unfolding before my eyes. It was like watching a stage-play based on a moment I lived no more than half an hour ago, and, weirdest of all, I was part of the cast, but I wasn’t playing myself.

Once the figure started going for the baseball bat, I knew that was my cue to run.

I heard them yell a muffled “***Hey!***” from behind me, but that didn’t stifle me. I sprinted down the dark hallway, past the living room, taking a right turn when I reached the landing. My legs bounded up the stairs, propelled by some internal directive that my conscious mind wasn’t privy to. Another sharp right turn as I hit the top of the stairs and moments later, I was sliding under the guest bed, picking up the bat I had absentmindedly deposited in the middle of the room as I did.

No hesitation. No back-and-forth inner debate about what I should do next. There was only one right choice to make, and I made it.

I steadied my breathing and waited. The guest room was impenetrably dark, thanks to the power outage and the lack of windows, so I couldn’t see anything from my hiding spot. I heard the commotion of the frenzied downstairs search, feet shuffling and doors slamming, followed by the soft plodding footsteps of the more lethargic inspection upstairs. It was all identical to my actions minutes before.

Then, there was nothing: near-complete sensory deprivation. My view from under the bed was an ocean of black ink. All I could hear was the sound of my own heartbeat, and all I could feel was my hand wrapped around the handle of the bat and the cold wooden floor against my skin. After a little while, I was numb to those sensations as well - I heard nothing, felt nothing, saw nothing. The tide of ink had risen up and swallowed me whole.

I couldn’t tell you how long I spent submerged in those abyssal depths, falling deeper and deeper, never quite reaching the bottom. All I know is what I saw next.

Two human feet, slowly being lowered over the edge of the mattress and onto the floor. Before my mind could be pummeled by another merciless barrage of disorientation, another appendage appeared, and it focused my attention.

A hand.

It crawled along the underside of the bedframe, getting precariously close to touching me, its fingers clearly probing for something. As quietly as I could, I maneuvered the bat around the confined space, positioning it so the scouring digits connected gently with the handle.

The palm latched onto it, heavy and vicious like the bite of a lamprey, and pulled it out from under the bed. For the third time that night, I heard footsteps thump down the hall, my voice shout the word *“****Hey!****”,* and another pair of footsteps chase after the first.

As soon as I was alone, I rolled out from under the bed to discover that I was no longer upstairs. Somehow, I was now in my bedroom, one floor below where I had been hiding, standing over my mattress.

Against all logic, I wasn’t concerned - I was drowsy. I knew I should lie down and fall asleep. I was aware that it was in my best interest to start the cycle all over again. But before I could, I noticed something outside my window. Something new. Something that hadn’t been there when I woke up the first time.

I don’t know if the pilgrim intended to wrench me from my trance when he engraved those cryptic symbols on the tree right outside my bedroom window. Maybe it was just a coincidence. He’d drawn it pretty much everywhere: Lovecraftian graffiti scrawled across every available surface in the abandoned town.

Once my eyes traced those jagged edges, everything seemed to snap back into place. I was finally awake and truly alone in my house. The perpetual stage-play had come to a close.

According to the pilgrim, it was a snake, an eye, and a cross, followed by an identical eye and snake. All in a row.

To me, it looked like a word, though I had no idea what it meant.

*sOtOs.*

\- - - - -

Who knows how many times that cycle had played itself out.

More to the point, who knows how many times it *would have* played itself out if I didn’t incidentally glimpse the tree outside my window.

In the end, though, I suppose it doesn’t matter.

After I broke through that trance, I would wander into town. See what became of everyone I knew in the two months I was dormant. Discuss the unraveling of existence with the pilgrim over wispy firelight. Then, when he changed, I ran down the mountain, broken by fear.

I’ve considered calling the police. So far, though, I haven’t found a justifiable reason to do so.

Everyone’s already dead. There’s nothing to salvage and no one to save.

They probably wouldn’t believe me, either.

That said, they’d likely still investigate, and inevitably would succumb to it just like everyone else had. What good is that going to do?

The area needs to be quarantined: excised from the landscape wholesale like a necrotic limb.

So, here I am, typing this up on borrowed internet at a coffee shop, trying to warn you all.

The pilgrim was right, though. I didn’t want to believe him, but it’s happening.

Now that I’m out of my dormancy, he told me I’d start to change, too. He said that the trance was my blood protecting me. He endorsed my change would be more gradual, but it would happen all the same. Not only that, but I'd live through it, unlike everyone else.

I can see the other patrons looking at me. Shocked, horrified stares.

Need to find somewhere else to finish this.

In the meantime, if you come across a forest where the tops of the trees are curling towards the ground and growing into themselves, and it smells of sugar mixed with blood, or lavender mixed with sulfur, and the atmosphere feels dense and granular, dragging against your skin as you move through it:

They stared straight ahead, and because my bed was positioned in parallel to the wall opposite the door, they hadn’t seen me yet. I couldn’t move. Mostly, paralyzing disbelief kept me glued in place. But some small part of me had a different reason for staying still.

I could move, but I *shouldn’t*.

It wasn’t time yet.

Eventually, they swung their legs around the side of the bed, reached to turn on the lamp, stopping their hand only once they saw me.

My mind writhed and squirmed under the fifty-ton weight that was the uncanny scene unfolding before my eyes. It was like watching a stage-play based on a moment I lived no more than half an hour ago, and, weirdest of all, I was part of the cast, but I wasn’t playing myself.

Once the figure started going for the baseball bat, I knew that was my cue to run.

I heard them yell a muffled “***Hey!***” from behind me, but that didn’t stifle me. I sprinted down the dark hallway, past the living room, taking a right turn when I reached the landing. My legs bounded up the stairs, propelled by some internal directive that my conscious mind wasn’t privy to. Another sharp right turn as I hit the top of the stairs and moments later, I was sliding under the guest bed, picking up the bat I had absentmindedly deposited in the middle of the room as I did.

No hesitation. No back-and-forth inner debate about what I should do next. There was only one right choice to make, and I made it.

I steadied my breathing and waited. The guest room was impenetrably dark, thanks to the power outage and the lack of windows, so I couldn’t see anything from my hiding spot. I heard the commotion of the frenzied downstairs search, feet shuffling and doors slamming, followed by the soft plodding footsteps of the more lethargic inspection upstairs. It was all identical to my actions minutes before.

Then, there was nothing: near-complete sensory deprivation. My view from under the bed was an ocean of black ink. All I could hear was the sound of my own heartbeat, and all I could feel was my hand wrapped around the handle of the bat and the cold wooden floor against my skin. After a little while, I was numb to those sensations as well - I heard nothing, felt nothing, saw nothing. The tide of ink had risen up and swallowed me whole.

I couldn’t tell you how long I spent submerged in those abyssal depths, falling deeper and deeper, never quite reaching the bottom. All I know is what I saw next.

Two human feet, slowly being lowered over the edge of the mattress and onto the floor. Before my mind could be pummeled by another merciless barrage of disorientation, another appendage appeared, and it focused my attention.

A hand.

It crawled along the underside of the bedframe, getting precariously close to touching me, its fingers clearly probing for something. As quietly as I could, I maneuvered the bat around the confined space, positioning it so the scouring digits connected gently with the handle.

The palm latched onto it, heavy and vicious like the bite of a lamprey, and pulled it out from under the bed. For the third time that night, I heard footsteps thump down the hall, my voice shout the word *“****Hey!****”,* and another pair of footsteps chase after the first.

As soon as I was alone, I rolled out from under the bed to discover that I was no longer upstairs. Somehow, I was now in my bedroom, one floor below where I had been hiding, standing over my mattress.

Against all logic, I wasn’t concerned - I was drowsy. I knew I should lie down and fall asleep. I was aware that it was in my best interest to start the cycle all over again. But before I could, I noticed something outside my window. Something new. Something that hadn’t been there when I woke up the first time.

I don’t know if the pilgrim intended to wrench me from my trance when he engraved those cryptic symbols on the tree right outside my bedroom window. Maybe it was just a coincidence. He’d drawn it pretty much everywhere: Lovecraftian graffiti scrawled across every available surface in the abandoned town.

Once my eyes traced those jagged edges, everything seemed to snap back into place. I was finally awake and truly alone in my house. The perpetual stage-play had come to a close.

According to the pilgrim, it was a snake, an eye, and a cross, followed by an identical eye and snake. All in a row.

To me, it looked like a word, though I had no idea what it meant.

*sOtOs.*

\- - - - -

Who knows how many times that cycle had played itself out.

More to the point, who knows how many times it *would have* played itself out if I didn’t incidentally glimpse the tree outside my window.

In the end, though, I suppose it doesn’t matter.

After I broke through that trance, I would wander into town. See what became of everyone I knew in the two months I was dormant. Discuss the unraveling of existence with the pilgrim over wispy firelight. Then, when he changed, I ran down the mountain, broken by fear.

I’ve considered calling the police. So far, though, I haven’t found a justifiable reason to do so.

Everyone’s already dead. There’s nothing to salvage and no one to save.

They probably wouldn’t believe me, either.

That said, they’d likely still investigate, and inevitably would succumb to it just like everyone else had. What good is that going to do?

The area needs to be quarantined: excised from the landscape wholesale like a necrotic limb.

So, here I am, typing this up on borrowed internet at a coffee shop, trying to warn you all.

The pilgrim was right, though. I didn’t want to believe him, but it’s happening.

Now that I’m out of my dormancy, he told me I’d start to change, too. He said that the trance was my blood protecting me. He endorsed my change would be more gradual, but it would happen all the same. Not only that, but I'd live through it, unlike everyone else.

I can see the other patrons looking at me. Shocked, horrified stares.

Need to find somewhere else to finish this.

1jlir6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jlir6g/when_i_finally_woke_up_everyone_in_my_town_was/,"When I finally woke up, everyone in my town was dead, and they had been for a long time. That said, I wasn't alone. (Part 1)","Honestly, I’m not sure what woke me up last night.

Noise didn’t pull me from sleep: no whining of the hallway floorboards under heavy footfalls, no clicking of the bedroom doorknob as a hand twisted it, no groaning of the door’s metal hinges as it creeped forward. To put it more simply, I don’t think *they* woke me up. They were present *when* I woke up, but they didn’t *wake* me up.

It was more like my unconscious body was on a timer.

When that timer ticked down to zero, my head and torso exploded upright in bed, eyelids snapping open like a pair of adjacent window blinds with an anvil attached to their drawstrings. My bedroom was nearly pitch black, save for the faint glimmer of moonlight trickling in from the window beside me, but the pallid glow wasn’t potent enough to illuminate beyond the boundaries of my mattress. As my pupils dilated, widening to accommodate larger and larger gulps of the obscuring darkness, the only noise I heard was the raspy huffs of my own rapid breathing. Otherwise, it was silent.

I went from a deep, dreamless sleep to being uncomfortably awake in a fraction of a second. The transition was so sudden and jarring that it caused a wave of disorientation to ripple across the surface of my skin like goosebumps.

Once my vision adjusted, familiar contours began to emerge from the darkness, and my hyperventilation slowed. The gargantuan wooden armoire opposite my bed. A puddle of dirty clothes accumulating in the room's corner. The slight circular bulge of a wall mirror beside the open door.

Despite the growing landscape of recognizable shadows, my disorientation did not wane. If anything, the sensation intensified. Sitting up in bed, still as the grave, I felt my heartbeat become rabid, drumming wildly against the center of my chest.

*When did I go to sleep? How did I get into bed?*

*What did I do yesterday? Or what was yesterday’s date?*

*Why can’t I remember….?*

Those unsettling questions spun repetitive circles around my mind like the petals of a pinwheel revolving in a gust of wind, but their momentum didn’t generate any answers. Instead, their furious revolutions only served to make me nauseous, vertigo twisting my stomach into knots.

*Maybe a bit of light will help.*

I slid my legs out from under the covers and reached for the lamp on my nightstand, the soles of my overheated feet pleasantly chilled as they contacted the cold hardwood floor.

Before my fingers could even find the tiny twist-knob, I detected something across the room. Paralyzed, my hand hung in the air like a noose. I blinked, squinted, closed and re-opened my eyes. I contorted my gaze in every way I could think of, convinced I was seeing something that wasn’t actually there. Unfortunately, the picture didn’t change.

A human-shaped silhouette stood motionless in my bedroom’s entryway. The figure seemed to be watching me, but I couldn’t see their eyes to be sure.

Automatically, my hand rerouted its trajectory, drifting from in front of the lamp down towards the baseball bat I stored under my bed. The rest of me attempted to match the figure’s stillness while keeping both eyes fixed on its position, as if my stare was the only thing that would keep it locked in place. I felt my fingers crawl along the belly of the metal bedframe like a five-legged tarantula, but they couldn’t seem to locate the steel bat.

Sweat beaded on my forehead. More nervous dewdrops appeared every additional second I endured without a weapon to defend myself, my hand still empty and fumbling below. I wanted to look down, but that choice felt like death: surely the deranged, featureless killer looming a few feet from me would pounce the moment my attention was split.

*Where the fuck is it?* I screamed internally, my focus on the inanimate specter wavering, my eyes desperate to look down and find the bat.

*It should be* ***right*** *there,* ***exactly*** *where my hand is.*

I lost control, and when my head started involuntarily tilting towards my feet, I saw the shadow-wreathed intruder turn and sprint away. My head shot up, the loud thumping of a hasty retreat becoming more distant as they raced through the first-floor hallway.

*“****Hey!****”* I shouted after them, apparently at a loss for anything better to say. Once the word exploded from my lips, I felt my palm finally land on the handle of the bat. It was much deeper than I anticipated.

As soon as I had pulled the weapon out from under the bed, I was rushing after the nameless figure.

\- - - - -

In retrospect, the fearlessness behind my pursuit was undeniably strange. Which is not to imply that I’m a coward. I think I’d score perfectly average for bravery when compared to the rest of the population. That’s the point, though: I’m not a coward, but I’m certainly not lionhearted, either. And yet, when I was running down that hallway, my plan wasn’t to burst out the front door, fleeing to a neighbor’s house where I could call the cops.

No, I was *chasing* them. Recklessly and without a second thought.

I found myself hounding after the faceless voyeur through my completely unlit home in the dead of night, going from room to room and clearing them like a one-man SWAT team, with only a weathered bat for protection. Startled and riddled with adrenaline, sure, but not scared. Even when I came to find that the electricity was out, flicking various light switches up and down to no avail as I searched for the intruder, my psyche wasn’t rattled.

The dauntless courage was inexplicable, discordant with the situation, and out of character. Its source would become clear in time. For those few minutes, however, I was all instinct: intuition made flesh.

Subconsciously, I knew I wasn’t in danger.

Not from anything *inside* my house, anyway.

\- - - - -

No one on the first floor: living room, kitchen, downstairs bathroom, all vacant.

No broken windows. No front door left ajar. No visible tracks in the snow when I briefly peered into my front and backyard.

No one on the second floor, either: guest bedroom, workshop, upstairs bathroom all without obvious signs of trespass. That said, by the time I was clearing rooms on the second floor, I had begun to experience an abrupt and peculiar shift in my state of mind: one that made my investigation of those spaces a little less vigorous, and a lot less through.

Somehow, I became drowsy.

No more than three minutes had passed since I launched myself from bed, bloodthirsty and on the hunt, and in those one hundred and eighty seconds I had become deeply fatigued: listless, disinterested, and depleted of adrenaline. When I reached the top of the stairs, I could barely keep my eyes open. I felt drained: utterly anemic, like a swarm of invisible mosquitos had started to bleed me dry the moment I left my bedroom.

Of course, that made no sense. There was a high likelihood that whoever had been looming in my bedroom doorway was still inside. Still, I wasn’t concerned. That ominous loose end hardly even registered in my brain: it bounced off my new, dense layer of exhaustion like someone trying to pierce the side of a tank with a letter opener.

I poked my head in each upstairs room and gave those dark spaces a cursory scan, but nothing more. It just didn’t seem necessary.

Satisfied with the search effort, I trudged back down the stairs, yawning as I went. Twenty languid steps later, my heels hit the landing. With one hand gripping the banister and the other scratching the small of my back, I was about to turn left and continue on to my bedroom, but I paused for a moment, absorbed by a detail so unnerving that it managed to break through my thick, hypnotic malaise.

I furrowed my brow and looked down at my hands.

*Where the hell did the bat go?*

I didn't remember dropping it, but the concern didn’t last. After a few seconds, I shrugged and started walking again. Figured I left it somewhere upstairs and that I could find it in the morning. Which, to reiterate, was a decision wholly detached from reality. As far as I knew, there was still some stranger skulking around my home with unknown intent.

The idea of *dealing with it in the morning* stirred something within me, though. As I proceeded down the unlit hall, all of those other questions, the ones from before I noticed the figure in the doorway, began gurgling back up to the surface.

*What did I do yesterday morning?*

*Or last week?*

*Where is everyone?,* though I wasn’t sure who *“everyone”* even was.

It was disconcerting not to have the answers to *any* of those questions, but, just like the bat, they felt like problems that would be better dealt with after I got some sleep. I was simply too damn tired to care. That changed as I stepped into the open bedroom doorway.

I stopped dead in my tracks, stunned.

Somehow, the intruder had slipped past me. Now, they were lying on their side, under the covers, chest facing the wall opposite to the door.

Asleep.

Before that moment, my exhaustion was a shell: rigid armor shielding me from the sharpened tips of those unanswered questions. The shock of seeing *them* in my bed cleansed my exhaustion in an instant, flaying my protective carapace, making me vulnerable and panic-stricken.

*What…what is this?* I thought, wide-eyed and rooted to the floor.

The figure let out a whistling snore and turned on to their back. Moonlight from the window above my bed cast a silvery curtain over their body, illuminating their face with a pallid glow. I felt lightheaded. My brain fought against the revelation, working overtime to concoct a rational explanation.

An oddly shaped, wine-colored birthmark crested over the edge of their jaw, which made their identity undeniable.

It was me.

And I was currently frozen in the *exact same* spot the intruder stood when I jolted awake.

The figure exploded upright. The motion was jerky and mechanical, more akin to a wooden bird shooting out of a chiming cuckoo clock rather than anything recognizably human. They stared straight ahead, and because my bed was positioned in parallel to the wall opposite the door, they hadn’t seen me yet. I couldn’t move. Mostly, paralyzing disbelief kept me glued in place.

I am into slowmaxxing and soft living, so I am patient, but want to develop connection and friendship that lasts. Also as I'm a creative, it helps if you enjoy art, doodles, stationary, etc. on your letters. I love this, as well. 

We don't have to have the same interests or hobbies. I am more looking for interesting and intellectual conversation. I enjoy contemplating life and am a bit of a deep soul with a sense of humor.

Quick facts: 

* liberal and feminist af
*  I'm obsessed with cats (and animals in general!)
* LOVE Halloween and spooky shiz
* I love to read and write (fantasy & horror)
* lover of art (museums, art galleries, and I also watercolor)
* I love the mountains and forests and campfires
* night drives with the window down
* the quiet right before dawn when the birds are waking up

I think waited about a month after they broke up when I got up the nerve to ask her out for a coffee. When I did, she was like “Is anyone else going to be there?” And when I said that I was thinking just the two of us, she thought for a bit and said sure. We set a date and time for the weekend. Well the day and time came and absolutely nothing. In her defense, I wanted to wait for her to text me so I wouldn’t seem pushy or desperate, but the text never came. I wanted to say something, but I overthought it and didn’t say anything. Fast forward to the next time we saw each other at work, and she says that her cat died and that’s why she ghosted. I said that it’s ok, but I later (maybe the next day) asked again (tbh I was still nervous so I asked it kind of bluntly), and she said “I just don’t have time right now.”

1jlikvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1jlikvl/i_accidentally_faked_a_kidnapping_and_now_my_town/,I accidentally faked a kidnapping and now my town thinks I'm a hero.,"Okay so this happened about 3 months ago and I haven’t told anyone the truth. I live in a small town where everyone knows everyone, and things get boring fast. So I tend to go on long drives to clear my head and get away from people. One night, I just… didn’t come home.

I fell asleep in my car in a Walmart parking lot about 2 hours away with my phone dead. When I woke up the next morning, I had 47 missed calls, 300+ texts, and my name was trending locally on Facebook and Twitter.

Turns out my friends and family thought I was missing—because I had made a cryptic tweet before my phone died that said, “If anything happens to me, it wasn’t an accident.” (I was being dramatic about getting ghosted by a situationship—yes, I know, I suck.)

But it gets worse.

Someone reported seeing my car being followed by a suspicious white van. The town went into full-on CSI mode. Local businesses were posting my face on their windows. A volunteer search party formed. People were hiking through the woods looking for me like I was some lost hiker on Dateline.

When I finally called my mom to say I was okay, she was SOBBING. She thought I had been kidnapped and escaped. And I panicked… and didn’t correct her.

Now somehow, that narrative stuck. People keep asking me to “tell my story” and I’ve just… been nodding and saying “yeah, it was terrifying.” I got free coffee for two weeks. Someone offered to pay my therapy bills. There was even an article about my “bravery.”

The worst part? The guy I tweeted about? He reached out and now we’re dating.

I don’t know how to come clean without becoming the town villain overnight. I think I’m just gonna take this one to the grave.",2,1743122265.0,confessions,1,1.0,False

The good news is, sometimes it's the small changes that make the biggest difference. Here are some game-changers that have *seriously* transformed how I get things done!

**1. The Two-Minute Rule:** 
You know those tiny tasks you keep putting off? If it takes less than two minutes, just do it right then and there. **Ping!** Emails? Done. Filling out a form? Easy peasy. It’s like decluttering your brain—instantly satisfying and clears the way for bigger stuff.

**2. Batch Tasking:**
Why does multitasking feel like juggling flaming swords? 🔥 Because our brains aren’t designed for it! Instead, try batch-tasking. Example: Instead of checking emails every ten minutes, dedicate two blocks a day to power through them. It's like putting things in turbo mode.

**3. The 5-Second Countdown:**
Ever find yourself in a motivation black hole? Try counting down from five and then just go for it. 5… 4… 3… 2… 1… Act! Mel Robbins swears by this trick, and honestly, it’s like launching into productivity overdrive.

**4. Declutter Your Workspace:**
It's wild how much a clear desk can untangle your mind. It's almost magical. 😌 Try tidying up for just five minutes before diving into work—everything feels more manageable when you’re not dodging yesterday's chaos.

**5. The Pomodoro Technique:**
Did you know working in short bursts can actually make you more productive? 25 minutes focused work, 5 minutes break. It’s like a productivity hack that says, ""Hey, your brain deserves a break too!"" 🍅

**6. Time-Blocking:**
Does your calendar look like a battlefield? Try mapping out your day ahead with time blocks. Not only does this keep distractions at bay, but it also helps set boundaries. Suddenly, you’re the monarch of your time kingdom!

**7. Celebrate the Wins—Big or Small!** 
Ever looked at a to-do list and *only* saw what’s left to do? Flip that narrative and celebrate every small victory. Did you finally send that awkward email? **Victory dance!** 🕺 Sometimes it’s the little triumphs that keep us going.

Life’s busy, wild, and unpredictable. But with these tweaks, who knows? You might find yourself with a bit of extra time on your hands. 

And imagine what you could do with that… craft your next big idea? Dive into a new hobby? Maybe even actually finish your coffee while it’s still hot… 😉 

What's your favorite productivity hack that made a difference for you without turning your life upside down? Or maybe you’re just getting started—what small change are you considering to shake things up?",1,1743122215.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I'm not a big fan of chocolate in general, but I do love cherries. So, I guess I’ll try the new hot cross bun flavour from Daily Bread. 

I love their 2022 and 2024, and I think their 2023 was dry and not as good as they claimed. 

Here we are, the 2025 version. I reeeeeeally like the sour cherry in it. It goes well with the not-so-milky chocolate. The buns are not dry and dense. 

I had it three ways: as is, toasted with butter, and toasted with no butter. It was okay, but I think reheating the whole bun in a microwave or covering it with foil and chucking it in an oven for 10 minutes at 160c would do the job better. Warm, gooey chocolate bun with coffee. I would say it’s a good way to start the day.

Just got the call that he does have IVDD ""disc narrowing on T11-T12 and T13-L1"".  Since he was still walking 5-10 steps before dipping down, and urinating and BM normally, we were going to go the gabapenting, melax, route but then I got to google and found out that if they have no sensation in their paws when pinched they need immediate surgery. I am extremely out of my mind right now. I just went onlien and purchased Metlife dog insurance, it becomes effective after midnight. I am hoping I can take him to the ER and hopefully there wont be issues with Metlife refusing to pay me back, but IDK if Banfield will be ""diagnosing"" him.

1jligzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingJUUL/comments/1jligzf/heavy_user_quitting/,"Heavy User, Quitting","I started smoking cigs when I was 16, moved to a juul when I was 19 and started going through more and more pods. I’m almost 26 now, going through about 1.5-2 pods per day. My quit date is April 1st, the start of my weekend. Though spring term starts that day, there is no convenient time for me to quit with school, so syllabus week it is! The only other drug I am addicted to is caffeine, and my morning coffee is definitely a trigger to vape, along with car rides and work. I’ve tried quitting before, but not with this much preparation or this method.

I wasn’t sure about sharing this journey, but with the amount I vape I hope it can cast a light of hope for other heavier users that feel a bit hopeless. 

My method:
- No vape. I am tucking it away in the junk drawer. I don’t want to fully dispose of it, I want to make the active choice to not use it.
- Low dose nicotine gum the first 3 days
- I have a physical list of possible symptoms to expect so I don’t panic at feeling like utter crap
- I have a list of activities written out for when I get hard-to-ignore cravings 
- Journaling throughout each day
- I wrote a message to myself today to look back on throughout the quitting journey for motivation
- Every 3 days I’m putting $30 in a jar as extra motivation for all the money I’m saving not buying pods
- A ton of CBD drinks
- I only drink about once a month, but I’ll abstain from alcohol for 3 months because it makes me extra feral for the juul

On Day 0 (March 31st), I’ll share what I bought to prepare, the motivational letter to myself and generally how I’m feeling. I’ll then share my journal entries each day, along with symptoms and how much gum I used. I’m hoping posting will not only help hold me accountable but maybe help someone else, too. 

Anyways, wish me luck!

No one built it. No one owns it. It has always been there.

There is a clearing with fire pits that never seem to cool, picnic tables that show no signs of rot, and cabins that should be abandoned—but aren’t.

They are simple structures. Wooden, one-room, with cots lined against the walls. The doors have locks, but the keys are missing. The windows latch from the inside.

Visitors come and go. Hikers, travelers, people just passing through. The cabins are free to use, and yet… they are never all empty at the same time.

Even when no one is staying in them, signs of occupancy remain.

A steaming cup of coffee on the table.

A book left open to the middle of a page.

A radio playing a station that does not exist.

The trails leading to the campsite twist and shift. No one takes the same path in twice.

You always arrive when the sun is setting.

The sky is the wrong color when you get there—deeper than twilight, not quite night. The trees stretch high, taller than they should be, their branches arching together like ribs.

At night, the fire pits burn low, casting flickering shadows that move strangely against the cabins.

There are noises in the woods. They do not sound like animals.

Some say they hear laughter. Others, whispering.

And if you wake up in the middle of the night, staring at the cabin door, unsure of what startled you—

Don’t open it.

Not until morning.

Here’s the juicy bit: **time blocking is great in theory,** but what if *when* you work is just as important as *how* you work? Enter—energy peaks and troughs. 🌄🌚

**Here's the deal:**

- **Skip Early Mornings:** For years, we’ve been fed that “rise and grind” mentality. But spoiler alert—I’m awful in the mornings! After years of coffee-fueled frustration, I finally claimed my energy peaks instead. My brain cranks into gear post-10 AM. Anyone else? 🙋‍♂️
  
- **Energy Peaks > Time Blocking:** Instead of rigidly slicing my day into blocks, I ride my energy waves. Turns out, those mid-afternoon hours where I felt most 'in the zone' were my secret sauce for getting things done twice as fast. Who knew?!

- **Identify Your Patterns:** Did you ever track when you're most energized? Is it post-lunch, or maybe late at night when the world is asleep? Keep a little journal or just jot it down somewhere. You'll thank yourself later!

- **Work Smarter:** Using your energy peaks means you get the important stuff done when you're most focused. Save the dull admin tasks for your energy trough (!), when thinking feels like running through mud.

Imagine this: no more pushing through brain fog, just cruising through tasks when you're at your peak. How dreamy is that?

And yes, **this isn't a one-size-fits-all**. Maybe your mornings are when you’re a rockstar, and that’s awesome too. The key is to *listen* to your body’s natural rhythm.

Trying to stick rigidly to someone else’s schedule might mean missing out on your flow. What’s your body telling you? Can you switch things up a bit and see what happens? 😉

Feeling burnt out or stagnant? Maybe it’s not about needing more hours, but reclaiming the ones you already have. Think about it and let me know if you discover something new about your own rhythm!",1,1743121749.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Yeah, me too. Just the other day, I spilled coffee all over my laptop. As I stood there with caffeine dripping from my keyboard, I couldn't help but think about how persistence isn’t just a nice-to-have trait—it’s a superpower.

**Let’s dive into why hanging in there is so crucial, and maybe even crack a smile or two along the way.**

- **Remember Rocky Balboa?** You know, that lovable boxer with more heart than anyone else in the ring? Persistence is like Rocky’s best attribute. It’s about getting knocked down and deciding to still keep swinging. Think of every setback as just another hurdle in your training montage. 🎥

- **Celebrate the small wins.** Managed to resist the snooze button this morning? Finally folded that pile of laundry? Treat these victories like winning gold medals, because momentum is your friend, and these small wins build up to something huge.

- **Find your why.** Sometimes, when you’re knee-deep in stress, it's hard to remember why you started. What’s that core reason driving you? Is it family? Passion? Cash for an endless supply of tacos? Whatever it is, keep it front and center.

- **Surround yourself with cheerleaders.** Not the pom-pom kind (unless that’s your thing), but those friends or communities that pump you up. They’re usually more reliable than caffeine and way more encouraging than your cat.

**But wait, does persistence mean banging your head against a wall forever?** Not at all. It’s about figuring out when to tweak your methods or when to wave the white flag and pivot (yes, like Ross on ""Friends""). Sometimes, the smartest move is realizing when to change the game plan.

Finally, have you ever noticed how your biggest breakthroughs often come just after your toughest days? Life has a funny way of working itself out. So, next time you face one of those days where nothing seems to go right, just channel your inner Rocky and keep pushing. You got this. 💪

Noise didn’t pull me from sleep: no whining of the hallway floorboards under heavy footfalls, no clicking of the bedroom doorknob as a hand twisted it, no groaning of the door’s metal hinges as it creeped forward. To put it more simply, I don’t think *they* woke me up. They were present *when* I woke up, but they didn’t *wake* me up.

It was more like my unconscious body was on a timer.

When that timer ticked down to zero, my head and torso exploded upright in bed, eyelids snapping open like a pair of adjacent window blinds with an anvil attached to their drawstrings. My bedroom was nearly pitch black, save for the faint glimmer of moonlight trickling in from the window beside me, but the pallid glow wasn’t potent enough to illuminate beyond the boundaries of my mattress. As my pupils dilated, widening to accommodate larger and larger gulps of the obscuring darkness, the only noise I heard was the raspy huffs of my own rapid breathing. Otherwise, it was silent.

I went from a deep, dreamless sleep to being uncomfortably awake in a fraction of a second. The transition was so sudden and jarring that it caused a wave of disorientation to ripple across the surface of my skin like goosebumps.

Once my vision adjusted, familiar contours began to emerge from the darkness, and my hyperventilation slowed. The gargantuan wooden armoire opposite my bed. A puddle of dirty clothes accumulating in the room's corner. The slight circular bulge of a wall mirror beside the open door.

Despite the growing landscape of recognizable shadows, my disorientation did not wane. If anything, the sensation intensified. Sitting up in bed, still as the grave, I felt my heartbeat become rabid, drumming wildly against the center of my chest.

*When did I go to sleep? How did I get into bed?*

*What did I do yesterday? Or what was yesterday’s date?*

*Why can’t I remember….?*

Those unsettling questions spun repetitive circles around my mind like the petals of a pinwheel revolving in a gust of wind, but their momentum didn’t generate any answers. Instead, their furious revolutions only served to make me nauseous, vertigo twisting my stomach into knots.

*Maybe a bit of light will help.*

I slid my legs out from under the covers and reached for the lamp on my nightstand, the soles of my overheated feet pleasantly chilled as they contacted the cold hardwood floor.

Before my fingers could even find the tiny twist-knob, I detected something across the room. Paralyzed, my hand hung in the air like a noose. I blinked, squinted, closed and re-opened my eyes. I contorted my gaze in every way I could think of, convinced I was seeing something that wasn’t actually there. Unfortunately, the picture didn’t change.

A human-shaped silhouette stood motionless in my bedroom’s entryway. The figure seemed to be watching me, but I couldn’t see their eyes to be sure.

Automatically, my hand rerouted its trajectory, drifting from in front of the lamp down towards the baseball bat I stored under my bed. The rest of me attempted to match the figure’s stillness while keeping both eyes fixed on its position, as if my stare was the only thing that would keep it locked in place. I felt my fingers crawl along the belly of the metal bedframe like a five-legged tarantula, but they couldn’t seem to locate the steel bat.

Sweat beaded on my forehead. More nervous dewdrops appeared every additional second I endured without a weapon to defend myself, my hand still empty and fumbling below. I wanted to look down, but that choice felt like death: surely the deranged, featureless killer looming a few feet from me would pounce the moment my attention was split.

*Where the fuck is it?* I screamed internally, my focus on the inanimate specter wavering, my eyes desperate to look down and find the bat.

*It should be* ***right*** *there,* ***exactly*** *where my hand is.*

I lost control, and when my head started involuntarily tilting towards my feet, I saw the shadow-wreathed intruder turn and sprint away. My head shot up, the loud thumping of a hasty retreat becoming more distant as they raced through the first-floor hallway.

*“****Hey!****”* I shouted after them, apparently at a loss for anything better to say. Once the word exploded from my lips, I felt my palm finally land on the handle of the bat. It was much deeper than I anticipated.

As soon as I had pulled the weapon out from under the bed, I was rushing after the nameless figure.

\- - - - -

In retrospect, the fearlessness behind my pursuit was undeniably strange. Which is not to imply that I’m a coward. I think I’d score perfectly average for bravery when compared to the rest of the population. That’s the point, though: I’m not a coward, but I’m certainly not lionhearted, either. And yet, when I was running down that hallway, my plan wasn’t to burst out the front door, fleeing to a neighbor’s house where I could call the cops.

No, I was *chasing* them. Recklessly and without a second thought.

I found myself hounding after the faceless voyeur through my completely unlit home in the dead of night, going from room to room and clearing them like a one-man SWAT team, with only a weathered bat for protection. Startled and riddled with adrenaline, sure, but not scared. Even when I came to find that the electricity was out, flicking various light switches up and down to no avail as I searched for the intruder, my psyche wasn’t rattled.

The dauntless courage was inexplicable, discordant with the situation, and out of character. Its source would become clear in time. For those few minutes, however, I was all instinct: intuition made flesh.

Subconsciously, I knew I wasn’t in danger.

Not from anything *inside* my house, anyway.

\- - - - -

No one on the first floor: living room, kitchen, downstairs bathroom, all vacant.

No broken windows. No front door left ajar. No visible tracks in the snow when I briefly peered into my front and backyard.

No one on the second floor, either: guest bedroom, workshop, upstairs bathroom all without obvious signs of trespass. That said, by the time I was clearing rooms on the second floor, I had begun to experience an abrupt and peculiar shift in my state of mind: one that made my investigation of those spaces a little less vigorous, and a lot less through.

Somehow, I became drowsy.

No more than three minutes had passed since I launched myself from bed, bloodthirsty and on the hunt, and in those one hundred and eighty seconds I had become deeply fatigued: listless, disinterested, and depleted of adrenaline. When I reached the top of the stairs, I could barely keep my eyes open. I felt drained: utterly anemic, like a swarm of invisible mosquitos had started to bleed me dry the moment I left my bedroom.

Of course, that made no sense. There was a high likelihood that whoever had been looming in my bedroom doorway was still inside. Still, I wasn’t concerned. That ominous loose end hardly even registered in my brain: it bounced off my new, dense layer of exhaustion like someone trying to pierce the side of a tank with a letter opener.

I poked my head in each upstairs room and gave those dark spaces a cursory scan, but nothing more. It just didn’t seem necessary.

Satisfied with the search effort, I trudged back down the stairs, yawning as I went. Twenty languid steps later, my heels hit the landing. With one hand gripping the banister and the other scratching the small of my back, I was about to turn left and continue on to my bedroom, but I paused for a moment, absorbed by a detail so unnerving that it managed to break through my thick, hypnotic malaise.

I furrowed my brow and looked down at my hands.

*Where the hell did the bat go?*

I didn't remember dropping it, but the concern didn’t last. After a few seconds, I shrugged and started walking again. Figured I left it somewhere upstairs and that I could find it in the morning. Which, to reiterate, was a decision wholly detached from reality. As far as I knew, there was still some stranger skulking around my home with unknown intent.

The idea of *dealing with it in the morning* stirred something within me, though. As I proceeded down the unlit hall, all of those other questions, the ones from before I noticed the figure in the doorway, began gurgling back up to the surface.

*What did I do yesterday morning?*

*Or last week?*

*Where is everyone?,* though I wasn’t sure who *“everyone”* even was.

It was disconcerting not to have the answers to *any* of those questions, but, just like the bat, they felt like problems that would be better dealt with after I got some sleep. I was simply too damn tired to care. That changed as I stepped into the open bedroom doorway.

I stopped dead in my tracks, stunned.

Somehow, the intruder had slipped past me. Now, they were lying on their side, under the covers, chest facing the wall opposite to the door.

Asleep.

Before that moment, my exhaustion was a shell: rigid armor shielding me from the sharpened tips of those unanswered questions. The shock of seeing *them* in my bed cleansed my exhaustion in an instant, flaying my protective carapace, making me vulnerable and panic-stricken.

*What…what is this?* I thought, wide-eyed and rooted to the floor.

The figure let out a whistling snore and turned on to their back. Moonlight from the window above my bed cast a silvery curtain over their body, illuminating their face with a pallid glow. I felt lightheaded. My brain fought against the revelation, working overtime to concoct a rational explanation.

An oddly shaped, wine-colored birthmark crested over the edge of their jaw, which made their identity undeniable.

It was me.

And I was currently frozen in the *exact same* spot the intruder stood when I jolted awake.

The figure exploded upright. The motion was jerky and mechanical, more akin to a wooden bird shooting out of a chiming cuckoo clock rather than anything recognizably human. They stared straight ahead, and because my bed was positioned in parallel to the wall opposite the door, they hadn’t seen me yet. I couldn’t move. Mostly, paralyzing disbelief kept me glued in place. But some small part of me had a different reason for staying still.

I could move, but I *shouldn’t*.

It wasn’t time yet.

Eventually, they swung their legs around the side of the bed, reached to turn on the lamp, stopping their hand only once they saw me.

My mind writhed and squirmed under the fifty-ton weight that was the uncanny scene unfolding before my eyes. It was like watching a stage-play based on a moment I lived no more than half an hour ago, and, weirdest of all, I was part of the cast, but I wasn’t playing myself.

Once the figure started going for the baseball bat, I knew that was my cue to run.

I heard them yell a muffled \*“\****Hey!***” from behind me, but that didn’t stifle me. I sprinted down the dark hallway, past the living room, taking a right turn when I reached the landing. My legs bounded up the stairs, propelled by some internal directive that my conscious mind wasn’t privy to. Another sharp right turn as I hit the top of the stairs and moments later, I was sliding under the guest bed, picking up the bat I had absentmindedly deposited in the middle of the room as I did.

No hesitation. No back-and-forth inner debate about what I should do next. There was only one right choice to make, and I made it.

I steadied my breathing and waited. The guest room was impenetrably dark, thanks to the power outage and the lack of windows, so I couldn’t see anything from my hiding spot. I heard the commotion of the frenzied downstairs search, feet shuffling and doors slamming, followed by the soft plodding footsteps of the more lethargic inspection upstairs. It was all identical to my actions minutes before.

Then, there was nothing: near-complete sensory deprivation. My view from under the bed was an ocean of black ink. All I could hear was the sound of my own heartbeat, and all I could feel was my hand wrapped around the handle of the bat and the cold wooden floor against my skin. After a little while, I was numb to those sensations as well - I heard nothing, felt nothing, saw nothing. The tide of ink had risen up and swallowed me whole.

I couldn’t tell you how long I spent submerged in those abyssal depths, falling deeper and deeper, never quite reaching the bottom. All I know is what I saw next.

Two human feet, slowly being lowered over the edge of the mattress and onto the floor. Before my mind could be pummeled by another merciless barrage of disorientation, another appendage appeared, and it focused my attention.

A hand.

It crawled along the underside of the bedframe, getting precariously close to touching me, its fingers clearly probing for something. As quietly as I could, I maneuvered the bat around the confined space, positioning it so the scouring digits connected gently with the handle.

The palm latched onto it, heavy and vicious like the bite of a lamprey, and pulled it out from under the bed. For the third time that night, I heard footsteps thump down the hall, my voice shout the word *“****Hey!****”,* and another pair of footsteps chase after the first.

As soon as I was alone, I rolled out from under the bed to discover that I was no longer upstairs. Somehow, I was now in my bedroom, one floor below where I had been hiding, standing over my mattress.

Against all logic, I wasn’t concerned - I was drowsy. I knew I should lie down and fall asleep. I was aware that it was in my best interest to start the cycle all over again. But before I could, I noticed something outside my window. Something new. Something that hadn’t been there when I woke up the first time.

I don’t know if the pilgrim intended to wrench me from my trance when he engraved those cryptic symbols on the tree right outside my bedroom window. Maybe it was just a coincidence. He’d drawn it pretty much everywhere: Lovecraftian graffiti scrawled across every available surface in the abandoned town.

Once my eyes traced those jagged edges, everything seemed to snap back into place. I was finally awake and truly alone in my house. The perpetual stage-play had come to a close.

According to the pilgrim, it was a snake, an eye, and a cross, followed by an identical eye and snake. All in a row.

To me, it looked like a word, though I had no idea what it meant.

*sOtOs.*

\- - - - -

Who knows how many times that cycle had played itself out.

More to the point, who knows how many times it *would have* played itself out if I didn’t incidentally glimpse the tree outside my window.

In the end, though, I suppose it doesn’t matter.

After I broke through that trance, I would wander into town. See what became of everyone I knew in the two months I was dormant. Discuss the unraveling of existence with the pilgrim over wispy firelight. Then, when he changed, I ran down the mountain, broken by fear.

I’ve considered calling the police. So far, though, I haven’t found a justifiable reason to do so.

Everyone’s already dead. There’s nothing to salvage and no one to save.

They probably wouldn’t believe me, either.

That said, they’d likely still investigate, and inevitably would succumb to it just like everyone else had. What good is that going to do?

The area needs to be quarantined: excised from the landscape wholesale like a necrotic limb.

So, here I am, typing this up on borrowed internet at a coffee shop, trying to warn you all.

The pilgrim was right, though. I didn’t want to believe him, but it’s happening.

Now that I’m out of my dormancy, he told me I’d start to change, too. He said that the trance was my blood protecting me. He endorsed my change would be more gradual, but it would happen all the same. Not only that, but I'd live through it, unlike everyone else.

I can see the other patrons looking at me. Shocked, horrified stares.

Need to find somewhere else to finish this.

In the meantime, if you come across a forest where the tops of the trees are curling towards the ground and growing into themselves, and it smells of sugar mixed with blood, or lavender mixed with sulfur, and the atmosphere feels dense and granular, dragging against your skin as you move through it:

1jli8w8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimLounge/comments/1jli8w8/is_everyone_supposed_to_have_an_awful_first/,Is everyone supposed to have an awful first Ramadan or just me?,"Hello,

I reverted in November of last year so as of writing this I’ve been Muslim for 5 months. Everything around me is telling me I’m doing horribly. 

For context, im from the US, I’m white, suffering from depression, and I’m a tax accountant, and the next 3-4 Ramadans are during tax season where I work 6 days, 55 hours a week. 

I don’t pray the required prayers, partly because I’m working long hours and don’t have time to take away from work to leave my desk. But also because I can’t make a single turn without something telling me my prayers are invalid. Don’t do wudu correctly? Invalid. Praying in English? Invalid. Not mouthing the words you don’t know? Invalid. Not praying with intent? Invalid. 

I tried fasting for the first week and had to stop after getting sick and then work was being affected which I can’t afford. I also couldn’t wake up early enough for suhoor, which also would’ve been spent alone without a family joining me. People invited me out after taraweeh for coffee or to hang out, but I can’t function on 4 hours of sleep, especially being out for work 12 hours a day. 

I struggle to learn languages so English is my only language. I don’t have people around me who speak Arabic outside of family, so I don’t really have exposure except the masjid.

I tried to attend tawareeh on the weekends to immerse myself in Arabic and to pray with the community, but that just turned into the white boy sitting alone while everyone talked to each other, followed by hours of doing mindless movements and losing focus because I don’t know a single word that’s being said. All while remembering that praying (the words I don’t understand) without proper intent is invalid. 

I lost motivation to read my translated Quran on my own which added to the sadness, because that should’ve been just for me and my growth but I felt like the growth was pointless if everything else I’m doing is invalid. 

So far all I’ve felt this Ramadan is alone and alienated, and that I’m basically invalid as a Muslim unless I was born Muslim or Arabic speaking. 

Eid coming up only reminds me of my shortcomings and how alone I’ve felt for the whole month. Is this normal for reverts? ",1,1743121287.0,MuslimLounge,3,1.0,False

(Whew! What a mouthful!!) I grew up Christian and have strengthened my faith in the most recent few years through trials and breakthroughs. I am not interested in the world’s way of dating, including sex before marriage. I wish to honor God with my body, relationship, friendships, and service. And I believe that Christians can have fun and still please God, it’s a choice. Looking to walk the road that leads to marriage. I have no kids, not completely shutting that down but less interested in kids in my future. 

I work in healthcare and am super busy most days but I also believe that you make time for what you prioritize so I don’t see that as a hindrance. I love dogs/coffee/laughing with friends/ poetry. 

I’m lame and not on social media (lol) but I still feel like I have a fulfilling life and that what I do is meaningful. Besides, the endless scrolling isn’t really my vibe when I could be out living life haha!

“Eri? Is that you? Where are you?”

*“Flip over the keychain Suletta! I’m telling you the payoff is huge.”*

Hesitantly, the mercurian girl located the tiny keychain sitting on her desk and gently flipped it over.

***“I TURNED MYSELF INTO A SINGLE PERMET PARTICLE SULETTA! BOOM BIG REVEAL!”*** a tiny blinking mote of light under a piece of scotch tape squealed, ***“I’M PERMET ERIIIII!!!!”***

Suletta stared.

“...What? No big reaction? I thought you’d be all…” Eri cleared her ‘throat’, suddenly putting on a perfect Suletta voice impression, *“UWAH!? ERI-CHAN!? WHY ARE YOU A DUST PARTICLE NOW!?”*

“It’s 4 in the morning… too tired to care.” Suletta yawned, “You *can* get back into the keychain, right?”

“Well as long as there’s a nearby source of PERMET, I can transfer myself into it, so yep, I can totally do that.”

“How does that work? Like, lore-wise-”

“SHUT UP, I’M ***PERMET ERI!*** Don’t try to bring your fancy logic into this!” the indignant particle of magic space rock yelled back, “I’m a ghost, that’s how! GHOST MAGIC! Or science! Whatever, ***PERMET ERIIII!!!***”

“Why did you ***do*** this?” Suletta asked, “You’re even more vulnerable now that you’re a single speck of dust rather than an admittedly rather cheap marketable keychain.”

“Because… of THAT GIRL!”

An awkward silence followed.

“Oh right, I can’t point. S-Suletta, can you just… turn your head dramatically towards the poster over there- No, not the- when did we- no, the other one. Yes. ***THAT GIRL!***”

“Amate? She’s nice but…”

“Yes, but she’s also *147 cm tall.* People are already saying that she’s the shortest Gundam protagonist.” Eri huffed, before proudly stating, “With this, I HAVE **DONE IT!** *I HAVE BECOME THE OFFICIAL SMALLEST GUNDAM PROTAGONIST AT A GRAND HEIGHT OF* ***0.5 MICRONS!”***

“...That’s what this is about? You turned yourself into a single mote of dust just to… *prove a point?*” the red haired girl pinched her nose, “People would write cautionary stories about people like you a few centuries ago.”

“Oh come on, it’s not that bad! I mean, aside from the fact I’m *inhalable, could get stuck in someone’s lungs for all eternity, see the heat death of the… universe…*” Eri trailed off after a few moments, contemplating her words.

“*Suletta, wait. I’m* ***inhalable.”***

“Yes?”

“So that means…” one could practically hear the proverbial gears rotating in her data ghost brain.

“***I can be snorted.”***

Suletta could only stare once again.

“Eri, ***No***.”

 \-------------------------------------

“***ERI YEEEESSSS!”*** the data ghost cheered, now in a pile of PERMET mixed with various questionable substances at a wild rave party in Earth House.

 \-------------------------------------

***\~ Epilogue \~***

*At least 14 partygoers were hospitalized for PERMET inhalation.*

*Eri would be found the next morning by Miorine possessing a busted up blender with a (used?) glock taped to the side, completely hung over and somewhat traumatized by her experiences the previous night. That being said, upon being safely returned to her keychain, she would immediately begin plans for her next scheme; THE PERMET VAPE.*

*Sabina would wake up in the kitchen the next morning next to Secelia covered in batter, along with an expertly made, world-class ten layer tall cake covered in the finest gold leaf. The cake would proceed to win dozens of awards and would become known as the finest cake in the known universe. The two have refused to comment on what exactly transpired that night, and have been producing more cakes in secret ever since. They are unequivocally the greatest pieces of culinary pastry humanity has ever produced.*

*After escaping Rochina’s clutches, Nika Nanaura once more descends into hell. In the aftermath of destruction dwells violence and desire in a new Sodom born of the Hundred Years War. Evil, treachery, corruption and confusion… all ground together as if poured in the same concrete mixer. Melkia’s very own Gomorrah… Nika drinks, and the coffee of Woodo is bitter indeed. Next week, Nika takes you with her into hell.*

*Martin, having had ‘the world’s worst justified crashout’ at the party, would go into therapy following his hospitalization. While undergoing therapy, he would at one point order from McDonkies. After eating his burger, he realized that it was simply the worst, most synthetic piece of food he had ever consumed and wondered how his life had come to this state. Following this he would resolve to turn his life around and become the best person he could be. His third album drops later this month.*

*Chuchu would never recover from her newfound coffee huffing addiction. Even getting a space data ghost inadvertently pumped into her veins and ultimately getting hospitalized for MAGIC GAY SPACE DUST inhalation was not enough to dissuade her from the substance. Seeking an alternative, she has decided to trial an innovative new ‘coffee-flavored’ vape Eri provided her.*

*Amate, having heard of Eri’s antics, would simply give the following statement on the situation; “Come at the best, best not miss.” Following this, she would proceed to land a half court shot from over her back.*

*GQuuuuuuX was found trying to turn herself into orange juice in response. She is expected to make a full recovery as soon as we finish getting her into a bucket.*

*I, Felsi Rollo, remain the only one who has witnessed the events of that night. The things I saw… they have been burnt into my brain. As the only witness of those events, it is my duty to keep record of these happenings so they may never transpire once more. I am the sole keeper of these secrets, the one soul who truly understood the secrets of that fateful evening. That being said, as soon as I finish writing this epilogue I shall be driving my cranium into the side of a Dilanza as hard as possible in the hopes that those images will never surface once more.*

*Guel avoided getting slapped, but decided to slap himself anyway to ‘get it over with’. Other than that his life has been pretty okay recently. Actually he’s already planning a new camping trip with the rest of the Jeturk employees. Things seem to be really looking up for him. Good for him. I wish I was him.*

We got a lotta stories out here.

Not much else to do when you're buried inside a rock a hundred klicks wide, with just rock-boring drones and air recyclers to keep you company. When the drills stop spinning, tongues start waggin’. And every station’s got their version of *him*.

**Captain Morren.**

Some call him a myth. Some swear on their mother’s vacuum-sealed grave they saw his ship with their own eyes. A blacked-out skiff, moving dead silent, unregistered and cold—like a ghost ship driftin’ through the dark. But it’s not the ship that folks remember.

It’s the **taps**.

They say he gives you a warning. Three little taps on the hull. Light as a whisper, but you’ll feel ’em deep in your chest, like your heart’s being knocked on. Some say he just wants to make sure you’re awake. Others think he likes the fear. Builds flavor in the meat.

I didn’t believe any of it back then. Just ghost stories told by jittery shaft-monkeys sippin’ moonshine brewed in coolant tanks.

Until we lost **Outpost Gany-3**.

Gany-3 was a minor pit—barely profitable. Corporate tried to shut it down twice.

Then one cycle, we get a mayday: garbled, static-riddled, and then… silence.

Recovery team went in two sols later. Found *nothing*. No bodies, no signs of struggle, not even spilled coffee. Just one message carved into the mess hall table, burned deep with a plasma cutter:

**""THE VOID TAKES THE GREEDY.""**

After that, the stories got worse.

Marco, from Drill Team Delta, said his brother-in-law serviced a relay station near the Karrik Cluster. Woke up to find the airlock welded shut from the outside. Spent ten hours clawing at it before life support ran out. The recovery team said his face looked like it was *trying to scream through the glass*.

And on the door? Three little dents. Evenly spaced.

**Tap. Tap. Tap.**

Some say he ain't human anymore. That he breathes vacuum. That his ribs are laced with carbon filament so he can punch through bulkheads. Others say he wears the suits of his victims—stitched together with fiberwire, a patchwork man of the Belt.

We laughed about it, me and Joss and the others. A coping thing, y'know? Easy to laugh in the light.

Harder when you're in the far shaft alone and you hear something—just a faint *ting* on the outer wall. Probably thermal flex, you tell yourself.

Definitely not fingers.

Then came **Sigma Rock**.

That’s where things stopped being funny.

We were a six-person skeleton crew, sent to reactivate an old shaft, hadn’t been touched in a decade. Joss swore he saw something moving on the cameras. Something too big for a man, crawling on the outer hull. I told him it was a glitch—those cams ran through recycled processors from before Mars independence.

Then the lights flickered.

Then we lost comms.

And then…

**Tap.**  
**Tap.**  
**Tap.**

We froze.

No one moved. No one breathed. It was like the whole rock went still, as if the asteroid itself was holding its breath.

Joss cried. Grown man, twenty years in the black, just wept. Said he never believed it before, but he was sorry, *he was so sorry*.

We all just waited for the airlock to open.

But it didn’t.

The lights came back on. Comms reconnected. We made it.

*We made it.*

Corporate said it was a solar flare. Same excuse they use for everything.

Joss quit a week later. Said he was taking the next shuttle to Mars and never stepping foot off a planet again.

Me? I stayed. I got debts.

And now, tonight… I’m writing this log because I heard it.

Just now.

**Tap. Tap. Tap.**

My hands are shaking.

I’m alone on Watch. Everyone else is asleep. The cams show nothing. The proximity sensors are clean.

But I heard it. I *felt* it.

There’s a shadow outside. Can’t see details. Just a silhouette against the dark.

I’m not afraid. I should be. But I’m not.

Because the airlock just opened. And standing there isn’t a monster.

He’s human. Gaunt, but strong. Scarred. Wearing a patched-together suit with old Federation tags. His voice comes through the speaker, low and tired:

“Easy now. I’m not here to hurt you. I’m here to help. You’ve got six months left of rations, and Corporate cut your supply line yesterday. I tapped to warn you.”

He hands me a crate. Inside—protein packs, water, med-stims. Fresh, unexpired, *real* supplies.

“They don’t want you to know. They’d rather let you starve so they can write you off and reclaim the station. I used to be one of their black-bag boys. I know how they work. But no more.”

I ask him why the three taps.

He smiles, sad-like.

“So you know it’s not them.”

Then he’s gone.

Just like that.

So yeah. Maybe Captain Morren *is* real.

Now I know it won’t give me motivation/passion for something that doesn’t feed me heaps of dopamine, but it advertises itself someone like dexi and coffee; for focus and attention, and truth be told that does capture my interest.

I’d rather not just read reviews and blindly trust if I can help it. So if anyone has any feedback on how it has helped, hindered or affected their adhd I’d appreciate hearing about their experiences with it.

Why am I getting all of this attention all the time yet no one wants to date me? To be honest I'm lonely. I want to meet my person. I want to watch a movie in my pj's with someone. I want something real. I even had a guy walk up to me in market basket not too long ago and he told me I was one of the most beautiful women he'd ever seen. I was so flattered. I told him how sweet that was and how much I appreciated it. Then nothing. He quickly walked off and told me to have a great rest of my day. What the heck am I doing wrong? How do I put myself out there more or signal that I'm available? Maybe I give off bad vibes. It's starting to get to my head a little. I'm moderately shy but I still talk to people. It's not like I'm hiding from everyone. I do try. I need advice ",5,1743120422.0,dating,33,0.73,False

The grinder sounded like it wasn't grinding enough beans and instead of whole picks it would discharge wet sludge. 

I carried out regular maintenance, I cleaned, rinsed, and greased the brew group. I descaled it and it seems ok but the puck was still black sludge. The coffee was strong and tasted fine though. 

I worry that there's a problem with the grinder. The black circular cap is loose and moves around when grinding and I don't remember if it always did that.

Try This 10-Second Reset (Saved Me 2 Hours Daily) ⏰,"**Ever hit that infamous 3 PM slump and wonder if someone secretly swapped your coffee for decaf?** 😴 We've all been there! Just a couple of hours of work left, and suddenly your brain decides it's time to take a mini vacation. So, what if I told you that a 10-second reset saved me up to 2 hours daily? Grab your snack and let's chat, because it's way simpler than you think!

**So, what’s this magical reset?** You’re probably thinking it involves some intense ritual or, worse, burpees. Nope! Here it is:

1. **Stand up (or sit up straight if you're glued to your chair).** 
   - Sounds too easy, right? But you'd be surprised how much slouching can signal to your mind that it's time to chill.

2. **Take a deep breath in... and out.**
   - Not revolutionary but *man*, when did breathing become so underrated? One good, deep breath can reset your brain like you wouldn't believe.

3. **Grab your water bottle.**
   - And stick to actual water, my friends—not yesterday’s flat soda. Hydrated brain = happy brain!

4. **Quick stretch – it’s yoga time!** (Super quick, I promise.)
   - Reach for the sky like you're trying to snag the last donut on a shelf. It’s about *stretching* and not quite about *reaching*, but either way, it feels amazing.

I used to joke that my afternoons were a write-off unless there was a promise of snacks or power naps. But once I started this little ritual, the energy levels picked up without any need for that fourth cup of coffee. 🎉

Now, I’m not saying this is a one-size-fits-all miracle, but sometimes the simplest tweaks can make a huge difference. I mean, who knew posture and a glass of good old H2O could turn you into a productive wizard? 🧙‍♂️

**But hey, what about you all?** Do you have your own energy hacks or post-lunch rituals that keep you from face-planting onto your keyboard? Maybe you fight off the slump with music or an actual power nap?

Ever find yourself scrolling endlessly through Instagram, only to realize that you've lost an entire hour—and your focus? 😅 You’re not alone! Sometimes, maintaining focus feels harder than a marathon when you'd rather be binging your favorite Netflix series, right?

Well, I’ve got some good news—there are *actually* apps to help us out with this. Yep, don’t worry, the irony isn’t lost on me. Apps to help us focus amidst all our app distractions. But hey, these little tech helpers are truly game changers if you let them be.

Here’s a roundup of some **mindfulness apps** that can boost your focus and help you work smarter, not harder:

1. **Headspace**: It’s like a coffee shop for your mind, minus the caffeine addiction. Imagine short meditation sessions that fit easily into your busy schedule. Just like a Netflix episode, but way less stressful.

2. **Calm**: Feeling like you need a zen moment in a chaotic world? Calm has got you covered with sounds of rainforest rains, ocean waves, and even Bob Ross painting—*happy little focus trees* in your mind if you will.

3. **Insight Timer**: For those who dread the sound of an alarm clock but love insight and timing. This one’s full of guided meditations that cater to different focus skills. Plus, it’s free! 🙌

4. **Forest**: This one’s pretty adorable. You plant a tree, and it grows the more you refrain from using your phone. Want a forest instead of a barren land? Get focusing and watch it grow!

5. **10% Happier**: For anyone who considers mindfulness slightly woo-woo, this one’s your pragmatic buddy. Designed particularly for skeptics. So, if you're a fan of sarcasm but want to give this mindfulness thing a try, it’s your gateway app.

Ever tried any of these, or got another personal favorite? Share your experiences or any other quirky mindfulness tools you've found. Isn't it kinda refreshing to think about how a few mindful minutes could be the key to not just getting more things done, but also enjoying the process?

The recipes I see floating around are all about the same, but this one was what I decided to go with: [https://breaddad.com/hardtack-recipe/](https://breaddad.com/hardtack-recipe/)

Even for a novice baker like me, this was pretty darn easy. I decided to go with a round shape rather than the usual square. I used my grandmother's rolling pin and my great grandmother's biscuit cutter. 

Honestly I think they taste pretty good. I was surprised to enjoy them based on all the comments people usually make about hardtack. But make no mistake: these ""crackers"" are really, really dry and hard and you simply cannot just eat them as is. They need to soak in some kind of liquid to soften up enough to be able to eat them. I tested the first one out in some Great Value condensed beef and mixed vegetables soup. Took about 15-20 minutes of soaking in the hot soup to get it soft enough to eat. 

I also tested with just a little bit of room temp water. That took about 90 minutes to get the cracker-biscuit edible. But it worked and tasted pretty good (to me). I think the flavor is something like 75% saltine and 25% biscuit. 

I'm thinking these might be good soaked in coffee as well. Might try that in the morning and see how it goes. 

Anyway, definitely try this out if you've been curious. It's really quite simple.  ",7,1743119690.0,NJPrepared,2,1.0,False
1jlhoh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/femaletravels/comments/1jlhoh5/2_week_sea_trip_report_vietnam_cambodia_laos/,"2 week SEA Trip Report: Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos","\*crossposted to r/solotravel\*

\*Goals\*  
To get a glimpse of all 3 countries in 2 weeks which is all the time I had. I wasn't looking for a relaxing trip but rather a ""see and experience as much as possible"" trip in case I don't return to these countries. If am I lucky enough to return I know where I want to spend more time now! This is reflected in my itinerary as you'll see. While I wasn't looking to be a spendthrift, budget was less of a consideration and I didn't set myself a $ number.

\*Budget:\*  
Do not have an exact number here but I'd say it was neither frugal not luxurious. I stayed in hotels rather than hostels, took mostly flights to save time along with a couple of buses but researched to get the best prices. I did not set myself a spending limit but resolved to be reasonable about my expenses without sacrificing safety or comfort. If anyone is interested in an ballpark figure, I can calculate one.

\*Trip Length:\*  
15 days

\*Destination(s):\*  
Note: Saigon = Ho Chi Minh City (it's just easier to type the former)  
\- Vietnam (Hanoi, Hoi An, Saigon)  
\- Cambodia (Phnom Penh, Siem Reap)  
\- Laos (Luang Prabang, Vientiane)

\*Accommodation:\*  
Normally, I make all my bookings ahead of time but I planned this trip pretty last minute and was overwhelmed by options + decision paralysis. To fix this, I booked middle-of-the-road hotels in each city, with research ahead of time along with a list of options but actual booking on the fly shortly before my arrival in the city. This offered me tons of flexibility but once or twice my first option was booked forcing me to choose another from the list. Once (in PP) I was upgraded to a massive suite. Even though I believe it was high season, I didn't have to go too far down my list before I found an available hotel. Having the list proved critical, allowing me to defer the actual decision without being completely unprepared; had I not done that research ahead of time, I would have exhausted myself trying to figure out where to stay while travelling.

\*Itinerary/trajectory\*  
\- Landed in Saigon  
\- Took Giant Ibis to Phnom Penh  
\- Vet bus (luxury, daytime option) to Siem Reap  
\- Flight to Luang Prabang  
\- Bullet train to Vientiane  
\- Flight to Hanoi  
\- Flight to Hoi An  
\- Flight back to Saigon for the end of the trip

\*Highlights\*  
Note: I walked around each city seeing the highlights but will not be including that here unless it's something I especially recommend as that info is very easily searchable and would make this too long. If you want details, please ask.

\- got my eyelashes done in Saigon. Fantastic experience and probably the most frivolous thing I've done during any of my travels but I have always wanted to try it, it was cheap and I researched a lot to make sure it wouldn't go wrong. Paid off in that I completely did away with eye makeup on the trip :) and am going to have trouble going back to just my own eyelashes. I have details for anyone that wants them.

\- S21 and Killing Fields in Phnom Penh, took about half a day and completely worth it in my opinion. Not an easy day but wow. S21 is just plain difficult and the Killing Fields are oddly peaceful. It's a weird juxtaposition; knowing and reading about absolute horrors while seeing and feeling so much beauty around you.

\- Angkor Wat in SR (I only had one day and this felt a bit rushed but I'd probably do the same again as short of adding another day to the trip, I'm not sure what I'd miss to add a day here). Absolutely do this, it's incredible even if just for a day.

\- Food tour in SR (I chose an expensive option but it offered some off the beaten track experiences). There were some unexpected surprises (ask me for details) but I would do this again. Group was also great even though I was the only solo traveller.

\- Phare circus in SR, 100% worth it. ""circus"" is a bit of a misnomer but it's still an incredible show.

\- Sunset cruise in LP (I found it to be a nice way to spend some time on the river)

\- Kuang Si waterfall - busy but I thought it was gorgeous. Really liked the tiny bear sanctuary.

\- Going up Mount Phousi at dawn (crowded like everything else but I still thought it was worth it)

\- Ninh Binh tour near Hanoi (it ended up being a rainy day but was still totally worth it...again crowded)

\- coffee making workshop, Hanoi. SO much fun. I made 2 types of coffee (egg and coconut). The results were delicious and it was a fun way to spend an hour or two.

\- having two jumpsuits tailored in Hoi An (this was done in 2.5 days and they are excellent. Not cheap but worth it to me). I learned later that jumpsuits are especially expensive (compared to dresses, etc.) owing to the amount of cloth needed plus relative complexity in sewing to make it fit perfectly. Like everything else, depends on style chosen.

\- I'm sure I'm forgetting something, will edit later.

\*What Went Right:\*

I was able to mostly stick to the plan and see most of what I had on the list. I had a couple of light scam attempts but didn't fall victim to either one and was never concerned about safety. I didn't drink much and then only bottled drinks or the occasional cocktail at a higher end establishment or on a tour. No weird experiences with food or drink, thankfully. Once I accepted the fact that all sights would be crowded and very commoditized with hundreds of tours running thousands of tourists there every day, it became easier and the places I visited were still completely worth it.

\*What Went Wrong:\*

Honestly, not that much considering the number of places I visited in a short time. Just minor things. The airports in Vietnam are an honest to god nightmare, made worse by the fact that I visited around Tet. As I stepped out of Saigon airport, hoping to get a Grab to my hotel, I was exhausted after more than 24 hours of travel with layovers. I successfully booked the Grab and was trying to find the pickup spot. It's not hard to find but I wandered a bit too far, into the parking lot. I fended off a couple of aggressive taxi drivers and came across a man who tried to look at my phone, asking me what I was looking for. I was clearly having a tired idiot moment; I thought he might be trying to help a lost tourist. He was actually trying to cancel my Grab ride so he could take me for the same price in his unofficial taxi. It was easy enough to get away once I realised what was happening.

A young man tried to scam me by giving incorrect change in Hoi An, the usual ""give smaller bill and hope they don't notice"" trick. Something felt off even if I couldn't put my finger on it so even though I felt stupid, I looked carefully at each bill and sure enough, one was off by a 0. When I pointed it out, I was given the correct bill without fuss but it wasn't a mistake.

I had an unfortunate incident on the train from LP to Vientiane. I was using a data esim so no local Laos number. Couldn't buy tickets on the app and had to use a third party. Still unsure whether it was a misunderstanding or whether I was scammed. I needed to to go Vientiane. They gave me a ticket to Vang Vieng. It was a strange system; pay and then collect the ticket at the station from someone else. The price included a shuttle to the station. The price was correct (for Vientiane) considering the shuttle and I didn't check the ticket carefully once I received it...really should have. I had to pay extra upon arrival in Vientiane (issue was discovered while on the train).

Weather in Hanoi was pretty bad even though it was supposed to be dry season; it was cold and rainy. I regretfully decided to skip Ha Long Bay as the day I had set aside for it was supposed to be especially gross, weather wise.

\*Notes:\*

\- cards are not very widely accepted (hotels being the exception). Make sure you have enough cash or plan to withdraw on the go.  
\- absolutely get Grab for Vietnam and Cambodia and Loca for Laos.

\*Final Verdict:\*

Expect tourism to be very commercialized in all 3 countries for the main attractions. Once you accept this and the crowds, you'll have a great time. Get that ""getyourguide"" or ""viator"" tour that you probably wouldn't be caught dead on in Europe. Everyone's doing it and it's probably most convenient unless you have tons of time and can make your own way. You'll be another sardine packed onto a bus in a sea of other buses but you'll still have fun.

I fell head over heels in love with Cambodia. They've been through so much and yet are so positive. I had some wonderful conversations with my tour guides, all locals from the surrounding areas. Wish I had more time here. Definitely go if you can.

I saw so little of Vietnam and will definitely return. Greatly enjoyed my time there. I found it to have less ""soul"" than Cambodia but it was great nonetheless.

I really enjoyed Laos but it was probably my least favourite of the three as countries go. Luang Prabang is wonderful but quite touristy. Vientiane was fun to explore for a day but I probably would not return.

Mini Review (10 in the kit + 4 more samples I asked them to add) : 

* **African Legend, 6.5/10** : Coffee + almond is strong in the opening, then the woods appear slowly in the dry down (vetiver and cedar). Tonka in base note, its a rich, opulent and warm fagrance. The idea is well realized. 
* **Vertigo, 7/10 :** Apple and raspberry opening is wonderful, the drydown gradually gets too sweet, untill its a bit too much, too sweet and coying/capiteux. Still very good, jasmin and vanilla base are well blended
* **Skin on fire, 5/10 :** Disapointed, I smelled nearly nothing in the opening and for 15min. After that, the cinnamon starts kicking. Its beatiful and well rounded note, but that cant make it up for the whole fragrance sadly.
* **Caramel sugar, 7/10 :** Orange in the opening is strong, didnt smell any caramel though. Its a fresh scent. Then the caramel appear with white woods and the dry down becomes a beatiful sensual scent. 
* **Sunset vibes 8/10 : Summer banger** Fresh, sparkling opening with the fruity and citrusy pineapple and black currant. The drydown keeps the spirit of cleanliness zesty fragrance. Banger for summer, might get the bottle.
* **Oûd Envoutant : 9/10 : THIS SHIT HITS !** The opening is fruity strawberry and peach with some sweetness chocolate smell. Then comes the cedar, majestic oud with a touch of lavender. Lastly, it settles on a sweet conforting vanilla/tonka base. DANG, I think ill get a bottle. 
* **Dragée Blanc 5,5/10:** Sweet caramel and chocolate in opening, then white flowers and vanilla making it way too cloying. It is exactly the smell of these little almond-shaped candies. Definition of an overly Gourmand, not for me. 
* **Ghost Oud 7,5/10 - Perfect daily :** A surprising pear opening (didnt see many, and its successfully done here, not too cloying). Then the dry down stays fresh and delicate with the red berries and the guaiac wood. Definetly a mossy note too. I could wear that all year round easily, thats a perfect daily. 
* **Al Andaluz 6,5/10 :** The coco-orange opening hits good, a little gourmand. But the jasmin, liy-on-the-valley and white woods just create an ODD drydown, something is not right there, disturtbing. Like, TOO green and TOO aromatic.
* **Iris Impériale 7,5/10 :** Opening is quite spicy with the pink pepper, not too strong. Then the dry down is majectic : powdery iris blended with musky leather scent. Beatiful and classy. 
* **Eclat d'amande 4/10 :** The opening is a synthetic note of almond that I found not convincing. The dry down is only black pepper and patchouli drowning every other floral scent (rose, iris). Yes, it is spicy green and fresh but not for me. 
* **Mythologia 5/10 :** Fresh fruity and spicy opening (mandarin and pepper) and the dry down is too leathery and does not allow the violet to shine. Could have been very good, the idea was amazing but not well realized. 
* **Renaissance 6,5/10 :** Opening very citrusy and spicy (bergamote, pepper).

I let out a sigh as I slid down the tree to a sitting position, fighting the urge to clutch my side. Allison was already watching me like a mother hen. If I showed any sign of pain, she’d haul me back to the cave and wouldn’t let me out of bed.

*What’s worse, Snarf would probably help her…*

I didn’t remember much after escaping the camp. Apparently I’d passed out and fell off of Snarf’s back. Allison said she’d “put a bandaid on my boo-boo”, then loaded me back up. I woke up this morning to Snarf standing over me. I’m telling you, you haven’t known fear until you’ve woken up to a giant saber-toothed tiger’s fangs within a foot of your face.

Both Allison and the aforementioned cat had tried to keep me from coming on this hunting trip, but I’d insisted. I wasn’t going to sit around in bed while they did all the work. 

*At least, not without TV…*

I allowed myself a brief daydream of setting up a flat screen on the wall of the cave. It was ludicrous, and I chuckled under my breath. My brevity was cut short by a jolt of pain in my side. I kept my face smooth though. I could feel Allison looking at me. I turned toward her, and sure enough, she was watching me. If she gave the word, Snarf would drag me back home. He had tried to block me from leaving the cave at all. It had taken Allison agreeing to let me come for him to finally let me to the door, sighing as he padded away.

I checked my bandage and saw that it was still in place. Allison walked over to me and insisted on checking the wound herself.

“Well it hasn’t broken open”, she whispered. “Still, we better not push it. Let’s bag this deer and head home.”

I just nodded in response. I didn’t trust myself not to make a smart ass comment.

*She’d probably just put an arrow in my other side…*

Allison turned away from me and slipped off into the brush. She was almost as quiet as Snarf, when she tried to be. She would need to be, in order to get close enough to make a shot. I stood and made my way after her.

The brush abruptly opened up into a clearing, where three deer were grazing. I crouched down and waited for Allison. She was about ten feet to my left. I watched as she rose, slowly, out from cover. Her every movement was graceful. With the sunlight filtered through the trees around her, she looked like a character from a movie. The badass kind that never misses their target. She drew the bow, silent as a whisper. WIth a snap like a trap closing shut, she released the arrow.

As soon as she released, Snarf broke cover. The cat charged at the deer, and one of them faltered. He pounced and pinned it down. He grabbed it by the neck and gave a sharp twist. I heard the snap of breaking bone and he dropped the corpse.

“Nice shot”, I said as Allison and I started towards our kill. She nodded and gave me a small smile in thanks, but didn’t say anything. I could tell she was watching me out of the corner of her eye as we walked.

Allison got to work gutting the deer and I took the opportunity to sit down again. I was still weak from all the blood loss and this trip was pushing me to the edge of my endurance.

*Maybe I should have stayed home…*

I shook off the thought and kept myself busy watching the treeline. We’d had more than one kill stolen by predators and I didn’t want to be taken by surprise. After a few minutes, I saw something that made me jump to my feet, ready to fight.

A large, hairy creature came exploding out of the treeline. It was humanoid in form, but at least nine feet tall. It looked like the pictures I’d seen of bigfoot. To make weird weirder, a woman was riding on its shoulders.

Snarf jumped in front of me and snarled. The creature abruptly stopped and the woman jumped down. Her feet had barely hit the ground before she started running right at us, letting out a cry as she did so. I stepped up beside Snarf in a defensive stance. I saw him turn his head to me. I glanced at him and he looked back at the woman running at us, then at me. I then recognized the look in his eyes as fear.

I’m not one of those that thinks that animals are psychic or anything like that, but I’ve learned to trust Snarf’s instincts. If he was scared of this woman, I probably had reason to be as well. 

She wasn’t particularly threatening though. She had shoulder length brown hair, big green eyes, and was really quite small. I guessed she would barely come up to my chin and was so slim I figured I could easily throw her over my shoulder. She wore a tan crop top that looked like it was hide or leather and a short skirt like the kind Allison and I had worn before we made our buckskin gear. At her waist hung a small leather sack that looked to have been filled with rocks, based on the shape of it.

Then I saw the look in her eyes. It was… pure joy. So intense it was almost feral. I didn’t even have time for the confusion I felt to fully set in before she was upon us. She threw her arms around Snarf’s neck in a hug.

I stood, dumbstruck as she laughed and stroked Snarf’s fur. There was blood crusted on his muzzle from the deer, but that didn’t faze the girl as she pulled back and planted a kiss square on his nose. The big cat looked to me for help, pure terror filling his eyes.

“You’re OK now kitty! I got you! I’m going to give you lots of fish and belly rubs and I’ll never let those meanie heads hurt you again!” the woman said in a high pitched, almost squeaky voice.

Allison came to our rescue, as usual. She stepped up to the girl and put a hand on her shoulder.

“Um… miss, you’re going to hurt him if you squeeze too tight.” she said in a cautious tone. The girl turned her head to look at Allison, but didn’t release the cat’s neck. Snarf didn’t know what to do. I could tell by the mixture of confusion and terror in his eyes. 

I couldn’t help but laugh. I let out a deep belly laugh and they all turned to me, Allison with a raised eyebrow. They didn’t get it. Here Snarf was, a several hundred pound killing machine with glittering fangs and razor sharp claws, but he was defenseless against this small woman and her hugs.

While I doubled over with laughter, the bigfoot creature approached Snarf, Allison, and the unknown woman. He gently placed one of his massive hands on the girl's shoulder. She turned her head up to him.

“Oh, I’m sorry Cookie! Did you want a hug, too?” she said, releasing Snarf and wrapping her arms around one of the creature’s tree-trunk legs. As soon as he was free, Snarf backed away and placed himself firmly behind me, looking around me as if he was hiding. I looked down at him, then up at the bigfoot… Cookie?

Cookie was looking directly at Snarf and gave a slow, deliberate nod. I was confused by that, but didn’t have the chance to ask as another party took that moment to join us. 

A pterodactyl landed just behind Cookie, and on its back sat a woman in a saddle. This woman was medium height, but ridiculously cut. I could make out clear muscle tone in her arms. She had shoulder length red hair and blue eyes that seemed almost predatory. She untied two straps tying her to the saddle, then dismounted. 

“You with her?” I asked, pointing at the small, still unnamed woman.

“Yep” she replied simply, then stuck her hands in the pockets of her pants. I started as I realized that she actually had pockets. Her clothing looked to be cotton, or some other type of cloth. She rocked a loose, off-white shirt and brown pants over tall leather boots. She was easily the best dressed person I’d seen so far.

“Name’s Belle” she said.

“And I’m Squeak!” said the smaller one in a high pitched tone that left no doubt as to where the name had come from.

“Well it’s nice to meet y’all” said Allison. “I’m Allison and this is Jake. The furball’s name is Snarf.” The cat snorted in reply to the insult.

“And this is Cookie! And this is Nibbles!” Squeak said excitedly, pointing at the large bipedal gorilla and then at another creature on her back I hadn’t noticed in turn.

Nibbles was a small creature that looked a bit like a monkey. Its head was completely round and it had a wide mouth, which when it opened I noticed were full of small, sharp teeth. It was hanging onto Squeak’s back like a backpack of sorts, looking over her shoulder at us. It crooned softly, and Allison “Oooohed” at it.

“Can I pet him?” she asked Squeak, approaching her. 

“Sure!” Squeak said. She reached back and practically ripped the poor creature off her back. I was beginning to see that she didn’t have much in the way of restraint. She was either all or nothing, but was very enthusiastic. Nibbles let out an indignant squawk, then took off into the air. I was stunned to see that it had wings. It circled the pair of women a couple times, before landing on Allison’s outstretched arm. She stroked it under its chin and it leaned into her hand, crooning again.

I approached Belle and gestured towards the pterodactyl behind her.

“So I take it this is your ride?” I asked.

“Figure that out all by yourself?” she asked.

“Well I saw you ride it in, so that helped.” I said with a grin. 

She grinned back and turned to the creature.

“Yep. This is Yamahawk. She’s a good girl.” she said, stroking the pterodactyl’s long snout. The creature let out a snort and nuzzled at Belle. 

“How did you manage to train…” I started, but was cut off by a roar.

I turned towards the noise and saw a herd of stegos running through the treeline, followed closely by a massive rex. The tyrant lizard was dark gray with red streaks down its sides and back. Its eyes were bright, almost reflective red; like a light reflector on the back of a bicycle. 

One of the stegos was about half the size of the others and the rex was gaining on it. I was pretty sure I’d seen this particular herd before. The smaller stego was dark green and its plates were beige, but with a splash of light green in the center. It had grown since I’d seen it last.

The rex caught up to the smaller stego and tried to bite down. The stego, however, didn’t take kindly to being made lunch and fought back; swinging its spiked tail against the side of the much larger predator.

While the stego was obviously still young and its tail spikes weren’t as big as the others’, being stabbed by four two foot long spikes would get anyone’s, or anything's, attention.

The rex, who had been trying to chomp down on the stego’s back around its armored plates, retreated a step and let out a roar. It then lunged forward and grabbed at the stego with its small arms.

When I say small, I mean small in comparison to the creature itself. Both arms were easily as long as I was tall and its two fingered hands were tipped in sharp, glittering claws that were each several inches long, at least. It grabbed its prey and sunk the claws deep into the stego’s back legs. The stego bellowed and tried to twist away, but the rex held it fast and roared out its victory. All it had to do now was hold on as its meal tired itself out, then it could eat at its leisure.

While Allison and I had stood in stunned silence, watching the grizzly scene, Squeak had started moving as soon as the rex appeared. I turned to see where she had gone, and she was approaching Cookie, Nibbles back in his place on her back. Cookie put out one hand, which Squeak sat on. Instead of placing her back on his shoulders though, he reached back like he was throwing a baseball.

“What are you doing?” I asked, but before I finished the question the massive primate launched Squeak into the air. She might have replied, but I couldn’t make it out over the roar from the rex. Belle just sighed and climbed back into the saddle on Yamahawk. 

“Here we go again…” she said as she started tying the straps to her waist.

“What are you talking about? What is she doing?” Allison yelled to be heard over the fighting animals.

“She wants to save that stego.” Belle said, resignation clear in her voice. 

“By throwing herself at it?” I asked, watching Squeak as she neared the peak of the throw, nearly forty feet in the air.

*Damn, Cookie’s got one hell of an arm…*

“You’ll see” Belle replied, then Yamahawk took off into the air, squawking. 

Then I did see. Nibbles opened its wings and Squeak glided towards the two fighting creatures. 

“Jake, we have to help them” Allison said. She drew an arrow and knocked it, then started running towards the melee.

I sighed, then looked back at Snarf. He sighed along with me, then rolled his shoulders in his approximation of a shrug. 

“Think I can get a lift, bud?” I asked. He answered by crouching down, allowing me to climb on his back. I grabbed a handful of the thick fury on his neck, then raised my spear. “Let’s go” I said, and he took off.

We quickly overtook Allison and ran around the stego to come at the rex from the side. We’d even beat Squeak, who was about three quarters of the way there, soaring over the plains. I could see Belle and Yamahawk circling higher and higher above us. Yamahawk turned and dove towards the rex in what looked like an attack run. It looked like everyone was committed to attacking the massive carnivore.

*To hell with it…*

I jumped off Snarf, the adrenaline coursing through my veins countering the pain from the arrow wound in my side. I hit the ground on my side and rolled, coming up next to the rex’s leg. Snarf leapt over my head and latched onto its thigh, holding on with his claws as he started ripping into its leathery hide with his fangs.

The rex roared again and turned, releasing the stego. The wounded herbivore immediately started stumbling away. Snarf released his hold on the rex and jumped free, right as its jaws snapped shut where he’d been only a moment earlier. I took advantage of the distraction and ran between its legs. I stabbed into its leg as high as I could. The spear sank into the animal’s thick skin and a gout of blood shot across me as I yanked my weapon free.

The rex roared again and started backing up. I ran with it, trying to stay between its thick legs. I saw Snarf launch into the air again, landing somewhere on the reptile’s side. The rex turned toward where Snarf had latched on, but then turned the other way and roared. I saw Yamahawk open her wings right before she and Belle hit the ground. She started flapping for altitude and turned back towards the fight. I could see blood dripping from Yamahawks snout.

I stabbed upward again, hitting the rex in the other leg. Snarf hit the ground rolling as I pulled my weapon free, and charged in for another strike. The rex spun and lashed out at Snarf with his tail, hitting the cat across his side and sending him flying. The maneuver caused one of the rex’s feet to hit me with a glancing blow. Still, a glancing blow from a multi-ton animal is no laughing matter. The hit sent me sprawling on my back several feet away from the creature. It turned and set its red eyes on me.

I knew I was dead. We had wounded the creature, sure. I could see gashes on its side and a couple of arrows sticking from its neck, but we might as well have thrown rocks. It started towards me, but on its second step something happened that neither the rex, nor I expected.

A small round object fell from the sky, hitting the ground right next to the rex’s foot. When it struck the ground, the object exploded. I felt shrapnel hit me in my legs and saw as blood spouted from the rex’s leg. Another one fell and hit the creature on the back. Then a third hit the ground near the animal’s tail. The predator spun, roaring, but finding nothing to lash out at. I looked up and saw Squeak gliding high above, making throwing motions.

Explosions went off all around the rex. It spun repeatedly as it looked for the source of the attacks and one of the bombs landed right on the end of its snout, exploding and showering its face in shrapnel. It let out another roar, but this one was different. A higher pitch; more frantic. It sounded afraid.

The creature spun and charged back into the trees, its thudding footfalls shaking the ground beneath me as it ran. I sat up and watched in amazement as Squeak glided down and landed gracefully next to me.

“Were those grenades?” I asked.

She nodded in reply. “Yep! Made them myself.”

I opened my mouth to say something else when Allison arrived, panting. She took one look at me, then knelt and started pulling up the legs of my pants.

“Whoa there,” I said, “At least buy me dinner first.”

I received a glare for my joke. I looked down at my legs and my sense of humor died. Multiple tears in my pants revealed torn and bleeding flesh beneath. I counted at least a dozen wounds spread across both of my lower legs. I winced as Allison put pressure on one of the larger cuts.

“Every time!” she said in an exasperated tone. “Why do you always get yourself hurt?”

“Hey I’m not the one who dropped GRENADES on top of me” I said, gritting my teeth against the pain.

Allison looked at Squeak, who just said, “I had to save the baby! I waited until you moved away. It’s not my fault you decided to lay down!”

I stared at her agape. I started to reply, but Allison cut me off.

“Enough. We’re not going to argue. Squeak, grab some of those leaves over there for bandages. We can cover the wounds, at least.”

“Why don’t I put some healing cream on them?” Squeak said. Allison and I looked at her. 

I just shrugged. “What the hell. Why not?”

Squeak called Cookie over, then had him take off a backpack I hadn’t seen. She pulled out several packages wrapped in large leaves and handed them to Allison.

“Rub those on the cuts. I’m going to make sure the baby’s OK.” she said, then took off at a trot.

I looked after her and saw the animal in question. It had collapsed in the middle of the field. I’m not exactly a vet, but based on the size of the cuts in its legs, it didn’t look good.

Allison unrolled the package and winced as she scooped up a black, tar like substance. A second later, I winced as well. The smell was terrible. It was like you took pine sol, coffee, and rotten meat and mixed it all together. Allison took in a deep breath, obviously steeling herself; then started rubbing the stuff into my wounds. 

It was cool and sticky, and it smelled terrible but it worked wonders. I felt a light tingle as soon as the ointment touched one of the cuts, as if the skin around it had gone numb. I poked at one of the tingling spots on my legs and saw that they had, in fact, gone numb. I could feel the pressure, but that was it. I looked up at Allison in amazement.

“That’s some good shit” I said, and for once she didn’t rebuke my use of profanity.

I saw Snarf extract himself from some bushes he apparently landed in when the rex hit him with its tail. He shook himself, then padded over to us. He pressed his head against mine, almost knocking me onto my back, then started sniffing at the air. He turned towards my legs, now covered in sticky healing tar, and sniffed at them. He abruptly shook his head and rubbed at his nose with a paw.

“Yeah it stinks, but it works. Good to see you’re OK, buddy.” I said, reaching out to rub the side of his head. He snorted and turned away from me, laying down a few feet away from us and licking his paw.

Belle and Yamahawk landed nearby as Allison finished doctoring my wounds. She dismounted and walked over to us.

“That rex is still running. I think we put the fear of God into it.” she said.

I snorted in reply. “Or Squeak’s grenades did.” I managed to stand up with a little help from Allison, then picked up my spear.

A silence fell over us as we turned towards Squeak and the stego. She was standing with her arms around Cookie and even from this distance I could see her shoulders shaking. I didn’t think she was laughing.

“I don’t think it’s going to make it…” I said quietly.

“The hell it’s not.” Allison said, her voice firm. She marched towards the injured creature. I looked at Belle and we both shrugged. 

“You kiss your mama with that mouth?” I asked. Allison’s only response was dignified silence.

Ever feel like you just don't have enough hours in the day? Yeah, me too. I’ve been battling with the clock for what feels like forever. 🕰️ But *guess what*? I found a hack that actually **netted me 15 extra hours a week**. Sounds crazy, right?

**Time Blocking vs. Energy Management—The Epic Showdown!**

*Alright, confession time*: I was a die-hard time blocker. Every hour of my day had a designated task. My schedule looked like a Tetris game, squeezing every bit of productivity out of my awake hours. But honestly? I felt like a robot. Beep boop. 🤖

*Enter Energy Management:*

1. **Identify Your Power Hours**: Instead of forcing myself to tackle tasks at specific times, I started paying attention to when my energy peaks and slumps naturally occur. Surprisingly, my most productive time isn't just before lunch, but right after my afternoon coffee. ☕️ Coincidence? I think not.

2. **Task-Type Pairing**: Heavy thinking during peak energy? Yes, please. Admin work when I'm in a post-lunch food coma? Absolutely. Simple yet revolutionary.

3. **Flexibility Over Rigidity**: Time blocking was like wearing a suit two sizes too small. By managing my energy, I found more freedom in my day. Ever tried answering emails while half-asleep? Yeah, me too. Spoiler: it doesn't end well.

**The Results?**

- More energy for hobbies (I actually painted for the first time in years! 🖌️)
- Less stress and more smiles. Nope, not even kidding.
- A cool new appreciation for how my body naturally rhythms. Feeling like a productivity ninja right about now. 🥷

*So here’s my big question*: Are you a time block warrior or have you dabbled in energy management land yet? How has it worked for you? *And here's the kicker*—what would you do with 15 more hours a week?

Asking because I ***LOVE*** disaster saves and what people are able to recover from. I'm proud to say I won this game with Nzinga, but I'll share my turn 95 position (standard speed). This is the most doable, yet difficult recovery operation I've ever had.

The following Gamemodes were enabled:

Secret Societies / Heroes / Monopolies / Barb Clans / Tech Shuffle / Zombies

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What went wrong:**

I spent so much time rushing Holy site/Holy site prayers for *Reliquaries,* and acquiring it that I lost out on taking land (it's all barb/zombie-filled plains below me and I have Ubsunur Hollow at the southern tip). After I got Reliquaries, Brazil completely **WIPED OUT MY RELIGION** as we were just declared friends (did this to found the Fountain of Youth city). Vietnam then ""surprise""-warred me, blitzed Mpinda, and took it.

During that time, the barbs scouted me and terrorized my capital, then continued to spawn in loads of zombies every turn after to block potential settles. Making matters worse, Brazil and Vietnam were #1/2 tech and dominating, spawning both in the jungle right above me.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How I won:**

I retook Mpinda, peaced Vietnam, and immediately betrayed Brazil. I took them on with Ngao and Hercules/Beowulf (with +10HP per turn Fountain of Youth) as they did not have walls. I captured his 3 cities in the screenshot, was globally denounced, but it did not matter because Brazil gave me 2 monopolies of Coffee/Amber. 10 turns in, Vietnam declared on me again but Beowulf chopped off the heads of all their OP Vampires and I held them off for a second war. Finally, I fully settled my South by \~turn 180 and went full Econ mode + Faith gen with Voidsingers catching up and winning Culture turn 276 being globally denounced, and at war with someone almost the entire fucking game.",7,1743118642.0,CivVI,1,1.0,False

I (24M) got hit in a car accident 3 years ago and hit my head and neck on the backseat of the car. About 3-4 weeks later, I ended up developing unexplained dizziness, nausea, and fatigue. I did everything from vestibular therapy, vision therapy, and took anti-anxiety medications and nothing made a significant difference. A year into all these symptoms, my neurologist referred me to his colleague who tested for POTS and then prescribed me 60mg of mestinon 3x a day, which worked like a charm. So much so that I felt like I was pretty much cured from POTS.

I lived in a quite healthy state for 1.5 years after (albeit with 2 flares in the middle) and even stopped taking the mestinon at some point. Fast forward to 3 months ago, I randomly became dizzy and fatigued all over again and the symptoms have persisted ever since. My doctor prescribed me the mestinon, which this time didn't take care of my symptoms. Then I got put on 0.1mg fludrocortisone and 5mg midodrine, which helped a little bit but not much. I was also on metoprolol but it made my blood pressure way too low and I felt an increase in my fatigue and dizziness. My doctor subbed it with 5mg ivabradine, which I started 3-4 days ago and tbh I still feel quite fatigue and dizzy on. I have also tried lifestyle changes such as compression socks, salt sticks, cutting out inflammatory ingredients, cutting coffee, to literally no avail.

One thing I wanted to note is that my resting HR upon waking is usually quite low (40s-50s, so much so that when I went for my heart CT they didn't even put me on a beta blocker), and it usually stays within normal range during periods of rest. The tachycardia part happens upon exertion and can rise into the 90s-100s with walking or even standing up by itself sometimes.

My neurologist still thinks this is a case of neuropathic POTS/autonomic neuropathy after a mild TBI. But there's a part of me that wonders whether there's something else that he hasn't put his finger on? I'm also being seen by a cardiologist but all my tests (CT, echogram, stress test, holter monitor) have been normal except for the exercise stress test which showed borderline ST. Still waiting to see what the holter monitor results are.

I'm in a demanding graduate school program along with an internship coming up and this dizziness is making everything really difficult. I can't concentrate and just living my normal life is exponentially harder as I just can't function.

It’s been 15 months now since I did this 1 week treatment and the improvements have lasted. 

Now I only use a patch every once in a while when I need an extra (temporary) boost.

**Original post from December 2023**

After 130 days of being bedridden, I was frustrated. I’d tried all the more conventional treatment options and I was still struggling. But thanks to communities like this one, I heard about the low dose nicotine trial for long covid. 

So last week I decided to try it.

And it helped! 🤩

A lot! 🙏 

*Disclaimer: I am not a doctor. This is my experience with self-experimentation based on a research study and not medical advice.*

I wish I had tried this treatment sooner and not let so much time pass. But the stigma and fear of bad side effects held me back.

I’m glad I finally gave it a try, because I noticed big changes starting on day one. I’ve been waiting to talk about it until today, which is the last day of this treatment.

I used 7 mg patches for 7 days based on the research published here: https://bioelecmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42234-023-00104-7

What got better:
- Brain fog
- Aphasia
- Shortness of breath
- Post exertional malaise
- POTS
- Chronic fatigue
- Nasal congestion 
- Stress response
- Parasympathetic nervous system activation 
- Exercise intolerance 

Side effects:
- Headaches on day 4-5
- Mild insomnia
- Getting grossed out by the smell of the patch a few times

I was on the lookout for tachycardia, vivid dreams, nausea and insomnia based on feedback from other LC warriors who’ve tried this. Some people have modified the treatment to be 12 hrs/day for 2 weeks to reduce the side effects overnight.

Overall I’m feeling hopeful. I’ve been able to walk around the house a little more, start a watch party group, and do a bit of exercise, which feels amazing!

Based on the study these improvements have a good chance of lasting for months or longer. And I don’t have to wear the smelly patches anymore! 😁

The last 15 to 20 pounds have felt so slow, and by mid-February, I was kinda silently panicking and consistently feeling that tirzepatide no longer ""works"" for me because I was having so much more food noise and eating too much (in my opinion),  pretty much every day. I was getting very depressed about that, and especially bummed that the scale kept shifting up and down the same 5 pounds. In the past I've mentioned how it's normal for me to have hungrier days, or even weeks where I just wasn't feeling the effects, but those had previously been short-lived. 

This time around, I felt like I was consistently off-track and no longer feeling much peace about my eating or weight loss. 

I'm on 15mg, so I also felt bad about having ""nowhere else to go."" I don't mind taking a bit more and doing shots every five days, but I don't want to go too far beyond that at this point. I was kind of beginning to think that maybe I'm not going to lose much more weight, and that I should just enjoy all of the other benefits I get from tirzepatide. Like pain relief. 

That said, I'm not ready to actually give up on losing more weight when I still have such a long way to go, so I decided to change up how I've been doing things. Add more protein, log my food, drink more water, and pay better attention to which foods and habits seem to best support my injections. For me, that also includes drinking coffee in the morning, consuming some protein shakes, splitting all of my food intake into two main meals, and being consistent with my ADHD medication.

While working on my tweaks, I also considered I might have to accept that I no longer get the peace of little to no food noise, or very much appetite suppression anymore. Lots of folks will admit that those side effects wore off for them, too. Maybe my time had come. 

It took a couple of weeks of tweaking, and I often felt like a ""failure"" trying to get myself back on track, but this week, I finally feel all of those good things again that I'd been for maybe the past 8 to 12 weeks. It's now VERY easy to stick to my macros, for example, because the food noise and my appetite are back down again. 

What's interesting, in my opinion, is that while I still haven't lost any additional weight, my shirts are definitely getting looser. Last month, I bought a size 18/20 shirt that felt a bit too small as I usually get 22/24 of the same brand. Once I began feeling good mentally about the way tirzepatide was working for me again, I noticed that my 22/24 shirts suddenly felt a lot more loose around my abdomen. I had to ask my daughter if my old shirts looked bigger than usual on me, and she agreed they did. 

Today, I pulled on that 18/20 shirt, and realized it's ALSO much more loose than it was last month. It feels as loose as my 22/24 shirts felt a month or two ago. This morning I weighed myself and I'm actually a few pounds MORE than I was last month, too. 

If I had ONLY been looking at the number on the scale, like I was previously doing for most of January and February, I would have felt so defeated. Now, I'm grateful to have seen that even when the scale isn't moving, I actually CAN be losing inches. Even at my high weight and low level of activity due to disability.

I just wanted to put my experience out there that sometimes we can get a bit too in our heads about how we're doing, and it's easy to get discouraged when we're not seeing big losses.

We'll see what happens over the next month, but I suspect I'll start seeing the scale move again, now that I'm more content with the reduced level of food noise and better appetite suppression. ",3,1743117997.0,tirzepatidecompound,1,1.0,False

A terrible sin. 

I feel like everyone knows what I’ve done. I’ve seen people, walking down the street, just stop whatever they’re doing when I’m near, and just stare at me. Just freakin’ stare at me. Even people who I don’t know or who are not from around these parts just stop and stare at me.

And they won’t stop. It’s been a month and they won’t stop. I’ve even seen people follow me. Once, I saw a guy turn around the corner with his pickup while I was driving to the grocery store. I panicked after he followed me for maybe four blocks or so. After that, I turned and drove through an obscure part of town. That’s when he stopped following me.

It all started when my eight-year-old daughter, Danielle, told me she saw mommy with another man at the mall two months ago. I didn’t believe her at first because I knew my wife better than anyone else, especially since we’ve been together for 21 years. We loved each other very much and were devoted to each other.

However, on that very day, I did take my daughter to the mall because she needed new shoes for gym class. That’s when I saw my wife, Arlene, with another guy. I don’t recall her telling me about it except that she would be busy today.

I brushed it off at first because there was no way that she would cheat on me. But I had to be sure. So, I took my daughter to the mall’s indoor playground and told her to play around and not to leave until I got back.

She’s such a sweet little thing, my daughter.

Anyways, I followed them around. They had coffee with some pastries at the local bakery, visited the religious section at the bookstore, and even hung out at the small community garden just outside the mall.

After a few hours, I saw Arlene hug the man and they said their farewells. I followed the man and saw him stop by the small communal Christian shrine in the gardens. He kneeled down and started praying while holding those beads in his hands.

At that time, relief sort of washed over me, you know. I couldn’t believe that this guy would ever commit adultery, let alone with my wife.

Then I kept seeing this guy always hanging around near my house. Washing his car, mowing the lawn, wearing his robes before walking to the church. He’s always there!

I didn’t like that at all. And neither did Danielle. She said that this guy is always bothering her. That he always offers her lollipops and cookies. That he and his daughter always invite her into their house.

It’s funny, I never talked to my wife about it. I probably should have.

But something was wrong with that man. I know something is wrong. There has to be.

When Danielle told me that she saw him with mommy again, I snapped. In the middle of the night, I took my daughter’s advice. I grabbed my gas canister and my lighter, poured gas on his lawn in the shape of a pentagram, poured gasoline around his house, then set it ablaze.

That night, the whole neighborhood was burning bright. I could feel the heat all over my face. I ran away while hearing the horrifying sounds of screaming in the house. I regretted my decision right away. But not enough to confess my crime to anyone.

The next day, Father, that’s when everything started to go wrong for me. It began with seeing Arlene crying over the news of our new neighbors being burnt alive in their own home. The news anchor reported that a satanic cult called the Black Robed Tribe was responsible for this heinous crime, given their iconic signature: a pentagram burned into the ground.

Ignoring the news, I questioned my wife if she knew those people. Arlene claimed that they were her cousin, Marcus, and his daughter, Gabrielle. They had moved here from Italy, hoping to start a new life. Marcus wanted to continue his path as a bishop of the Catholic faith.

I replied to her, saying that I didn’t believe her. I told her that our daughter had seen her cheating on me with another man and that this same man was harassing our daughter.

The reaction from my wife baffles me to this day. She told me that we have no daughter. She insisted that she had only met him at the mall and had informed me about it. She even showed me text messages on my phone to confirm her story.

After that, she left the house in such wrath and in such tears. I was left in a confused state, you know.

I remember turning around to watch the TV and contemplate my actions when I saw my daughter—or not my daughter—Danielle, or rather her face pops up on TV. The news anchor claimed that she had been the leader of this cult for 47 years. Her face looked the same as my eight-year-old daughter. But what I remember most is that I thought I saw the face on the TV move her eyes towards me. And it started to form a smile.

I figured I must have been imagining things.

My wife has not returned to me since that day. I haven’t seen my daughter either. She must have taken her. I hope they're both doing okay. I tried reaching them by phone, but all I get is voicemail.

Ever since then, you remember that I mentioned to you about people just staring at me. Well, that’s when it started. Recently, these people have started pointing at me too. They seem to be mouthing something to me, not saying a damn word.

I keep hearing the flapping of large wings all around me during my rare visits to the grocery store. It’s louder than my radio put to the max. Once, I even saw this large pristine white feather fall from the sky onto the hood of my car. I looked up, seeing no bird in the sky. Not even a cloud or plane. Just nothing.

Today, it got worse. The flapping sounds got so loud, so intense. It’s deafening. But there’s nothing in the sky. The feathers become more frequent now. It’s like wherever I go, the road is paved with them. I brought one to you so you can see.

Give me a second, I will get it out of my pocket. Wait. No. It’s not there.

Anyways, these people who point at me, people whom I know or don’t know, now say something to me. I think they keep saying ""judgement day"" or something. I don’t know, Father, it’s really freaking me out.

Now they’re starting to follow me. I ran into your church, hoping to find sanctuary. But I feel that I will have to own up to my mistakes. I keep delaying it, but I can’t anymore.

Father, you have known me for a long time. Ever since I was a child. You also know that I am an agnostic person, even though I was brought up by a loving Christian family. So, it’s very rare for me to come to church.

I feel lost. Astray. Somehow I feel manipulated, deceived. I don’t know why. Maybe because I am so weak.

Father, what should I do?

Maybe I should run away. That’s it! That’s the answer, right?

Father?

I didn’t realize how long I’ve been talking. Your folks stopped playing the organ.

Father, are you okay? Why are you growling?

You know what Father, I uh, I better go.

This is a weird question, but I just brewed one and it smelled gross/nasty/burnt. (Wait, there's more, I didn't have enough water in the resovoir while it was brewing so I poured some in while brewing and it made a weird sound temporarily.) Then I brewed a second one and it still smelled weird. So then I did a water cycle to clean out my machine and did a THIRD one. It still smells off to me. I don't feel certain, I feel confused- I don't remember how it's supposed to smell. But one thing I'm thinking is that I've never noticed it smelled bad before and I have a habit of smelling my coffee after I brew it. 

I know this is a really odd question and I apologize for that- but any thoughts? Is it supposed to smell a bit burnt? I will try adding oat barista milk to it tomorrow as always and see how it is. It's my fave Nespresso I've ever had so I love it and even though I'm not confident about if there's an issue, or if it always smelled like this- I just keep thinking that if it did I would have noticed before. 

My husband thinks they smell fine but he's never tried them before so he dissent have a baseline for how they should smell and if it's normal or not and besides he's an ""it's fine"" kinda guy by default lol!

I used to be a loner. All friendships I had were superficial, and I was aware of that, and I was fine with that.

Now, I have friends that I genuinely love. They mean the world to me and I have a hard time picturing my life without them. They made me believe in this whole friendship thing. They're great people and I love their energy.

But GOD. Sometimes I wish I was still a loner. Here's a few things:

1. While they do make my life better, I feel like I'm always stepping on ice and performing a show. And once they see through my façade, they'll see that I'm a miserable person and uninteresting human being.

2. I hate having tough conversations. I feel like I always double down and never get my point across properly. I'm writing this because I just had a tough convo with a friend. Ugh. I always try to say exacly what I feel (so that the person sees I'm being genuine and not attacking them) and when that happens I genuinely feel like a manipulator. 

3. They can just... leave? Like, one day you're snirting coffee out your nose from laughing so hard, and the next minute they're just.. gone? You don't have a fallout, you just.. drift apart. And I don't mean this in a high school way where you go to different colleges and lose touch. I'm 25. I mean this in a we-all-have-a-life-of-our-own way.

1jlgj8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jlgj8z/got_fired_over_negative_google_reviews/,Got fired over negative Google Reviews,"
TLDR: Worked at Japanese cafe as an allrounder that wasn't adequately staffed for an unprecedented busy day. I worked my ass off to clean up big water pipe spill after spill whilst still helping my coworkers and customers to keep the flow going. I came out of it incredibly exhausted and headachey. The next morning I got told I was fired BC of the two negative reviews made about me for seeming to do the ""bare minimum"" and ""letting down their experience"" BC I was tired and soaking wet. And my boss sacked me without any support and empathy for my situation.

Full version:
I used to be an all-rounder and had been working there for about a year this Japanese cafe in my neighbourhood. I love the staff and the regulars that came in. Three days prior, I sent my 2 weeks notice to my boss as I wanted to focus on my studies (as it's all day time weekdays). Sent him a nice proper letter about but I all I got was a ""Got it, all the best"" out of him so whatever. 

On my last day at work (which I didn't know was gonna be my last day), working with my boss who was the barista, it was pretty busy. A little bit more chaotic than the regular rush that we got on a Wednesday yunno. And in the middle of the rush, as he makes a babycinno, he grabs the rainbow sprinkles toppings and it spills over the bar floor. Like it went into every crevice and crack and hole. It's just a hiccup I tell myself. 

So after the rush of coffee orders were calmer, I was already brushing up and vacuuming the whole bar despite how incredibly cramped it was to clean and waltz around the employees. And now the wave of coffee rush was over. My boss starts cleaning around for any other damn sprinkle. He accidentally knocks off the water pipe connecting the ice machine and it starts flooding the floor of the bar and leaking into the front space (customer space). Sigh...Again, I told myself it was just a hiccup. 

My boss tries to mitigate the water spreading but I told him to just focus on making the drinks while I sort it out. Grabbed a squeegee and all the kitchen towels and directed it out of customers' way. I remember seeing so many customers and regulars looking a little surprised at the situation. I went to the source of the water pop (that was still spilling) and connected it back to the water machine. I was kneeling underneath the coffee bench space (where the ice machine lives). I was cramped as hell and spent about squeegeeing and soaking all the water with a fuck ton of kitchen towels and serviettes. I had to make sure all it was dry and extra dry (BC my boss is a bit of OCD neat freak). 

So as I'm done and out of breath, we push the ice machine back into its position. And as I'm drying the leftover wet streaks. The flimsy water pipe starts leaking again and I was back to square one. I was pretty damn frustrated like I was on my hands and knees and pants soaked. And again, I had to do it all over again for anouther 15 minutes. As I stood up, I was feeling really worn out and incredibly knackered after 25 mins of that.  I don't have the best aerobic capacity and I'm not that fit whatsoever so I was pretty out of it. I didn't receive any comment about the effort. 

Despite the tiredness, couldn't take a break or anything, so I still took customer orders and did my regular tasks. Genuinely tho, from the terrible sleep plus the inconvenience of those spills, I couldn't muster up the customer service energy that I usually had. I was so damn exhausted. 

It was an usually busy for a Wednesday at the cafe. I got through to the end of the day and just had a bit of sob moment. 

Then the next morning (my day off), I received a message saying 

""Hi XXX, I received two serious negative reviews about your behaviour yesterday. This isnt the first time that I've heard about this. It was a difficult decision but you are no longer fit to working here anymore.... All the best"" 

I was shocked. Incredibly upset. I kept back tracking to when I could have possibly have been an ""unfriendly person"" and it looked she was ""only doing the bare minimum as she seemed to have no energy"". The customer was ""really ashamed that the whole experience was let down by the girl in the cap"". I just cried. After everything that happened yesterday. I was on my hand and knees. Chewed out and soaked up like rag. And I GET fired for feeling exhausted. No empathy as to the reason of my ""bare minimum"" or any recognition of my efforts yesterday.

So yeah, I'm out of a job now yay.

I wanted a bag that can carry it all while commuting. Sometimes I ride to coffee shops to do work or sometimes to grocery stores. Just wanted a bag that could do it all, becuase I do not wanna ride with a backpack. I opted for a single pannier before this, and while I like the bottomless hole on the side of my bike, I just was not using it much. I would still utilize a backpack but just place it inside of the pannier. I also only have a rack for my commuter bike so I was only able to use it on there. I was hoping the Zeitgeist would be a better option for my needs and indeed it was! I was able to fit my 14 in MacBook Air and my iPad mini with its carry case, which was the most important part for me. There’s more than enough room in here for my edc.

## why Choose a Breville Coffee grinder?

Breville has earned a reputation for producing high-quality kitchen appliances, and their coffee grinders are no exception. Known for their durability, precision, and ease of use, Breville coffee grinders offer a significant upgrade over pre-ground coffee or less capable grinders. A good grinder is the key to a great cup of coffee, extracting the full flavor potential from your beans.

Whether you're aiming for the delicate balance of a pour-over, the rich intensity of an espresso, or the comforting boldness of a French press, a Breville coffee grinder will deliver the consistent grind size crucial for optimal extraction. Compared to blade grinders, Breville's burr grinders crush coffee beans between two burrs, resulting in a uniform particle size. This consistency eliminates the bitter over-extraction of fines and weak under-extraction of coarse particles that plague blade grinders, paving the way for a brighter, more nuanced cup.

## Understanding Breville Coffee Grinder Settings

One of the key advantages of Breville coffee grinders is their wide range of **grind size settings**. Though, understanding how these settings translate to different brewing methods is crucial for achieving optimal results. Here's a general guideline:

*   **Espresso:** Requires the finest grind setting (typically 1-10 on the Smart Grinder Pro). A fine grind allows for proper resistance and extraction under high pressure.
*   **Moka Pot:** Slightly coarser than espresso (around 10-15 on the Smart Grinder Pro).
*   **Pour Over (e.g.,Hario V60,Chemex):** Medium-fine grind (around 15-25 on the Smart Grinder Pro). the grind size should allow for a consistent flow rate without excessive channeling.*   **Drip Coffee (e.g.,Automatic Drip Machine):** Medium grind (around 25-35 on the Smart Grinder Pro).
*   **French Press:** Coarse grind (around 35-60 on the Smart Grinder Pro). A coarse grind prevents the coffee from over-extracting and producing a bitter taste.
*   **Cold Brew:** Extra coarse grind (similar to French press).It's important to note that these are just general guidelines, and the optimal grind size may vary depending on the specific coffee beans, grinder, and brewing method. Experimentation is key to finding the perfect grind for your taste.

## Burr Type matters: Conical vs. Flat

Breville coffee grinders primarily utilize **conical burr grinders**. Conical burrs are known for their ability to produce a more consistent grind at lower speeds, minimizing heat buildup and preserving the delicate aromas of the coffee beans. They are also generally quieter than flat burr grinders.

1jlgfqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1jlgfqh/i_quit_caffeine_and_i_have_zero_desire_to_go_back/,I quit caffeine and I have zero desire to go back.,"I was only a one-cup-a-day coffee drinker. 

When I quit at the beginning of this month, I thought I would have the urge to start again. I thought I loved coffee. I thought it was such an important part of my routine and a part of my identity. 

I quit to try quitting. I wasn’t serious. I just wanted to see what life without this stimulant would feel like. I didn’t believe coffee was a bad habit of mine. 

From reading this forum, it seems like people are often in a cycle of quitting, starting, quitting. I thought I would feel the same way. 

What I didn’t expect is how going decaf actually impacted my life and body. The racing mind, energy spurts and crashes, obsession about things I can’t control, sleep that I thought was deep but actually wasn’t (I know this now)- all of it has disappeared. 

It is hard to explain how it feels to be here. It is only something a person could understand if they try it. It’s like becoming a slightly improved version of yourself in an alternate universe; impossible to explain accurately but you know it when you are it. 

I think my certainty that I will never return to caffeine and the reason I have no cravings comes from realizing that what I searched for from caffeine was actually already inside of me. Like Dorothy realizing she could just click her red slippers and go home all along. 

I now am starting to believe that anyone who says going decaf didn’t positively affect their life is not sensitive to the subtle but powerful changes in their body. Some people in this world don’t notice that they are pregnant until months in. Some people don’t notice the holes in their socks. I think those are the types of people who could say that decaf didn’t change them.

The improvements are obvious for someone who is present in their body. These improvements are so obvious to me that I don’t have to try to convince myself to not consume caffeine anymore. Why would I want anything but how I feel now? I don’t.
