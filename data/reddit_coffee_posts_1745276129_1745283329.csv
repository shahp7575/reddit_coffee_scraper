1k4tmz8,https://i.redd.it/h4vc5y8maawe1.jpeg,This protein powder brand causes a significant reduction in blood sugar spikes if I drink it before having a carb moderate meal,"MY DISCOVERIES: Drinking this brand of protein powder about 1 hour before eating a carb moderate meal (like oatmeal) significantly lowers the blood sugar spikes and balances out the duration of the spike. 

EXAMPLE: I ate chicken nuggets which normally spikes my blood sugar to ~180. One day, I drank this before eating the nuggets and my blood sugar only rose to 130.

WHY THIS WORKS: This brand has 25g of protein which counteracts the carbs in meals.It also is made with monk fruit extract which has 0 effect on blood sugar. I believe this powder works specifically because the ingredients are very clean and minimal‚Äî there‚Äôs no extra ingredients to counteract the protein. 

I‚ÄôM SURPRISED BECAUSE: I‚Äôve tried different protein powder brands before, such as Orgain, Collagen Peptides and Kirkland. Out of the ones I‚Äôve tried, NONE of them causes a significant reduction in my blood sugar levels even though they all have 20-30g of protein.

Not an ad. I just wanted to share my discoveries. I saw this brand through an Instagram ad. Initially I was drinking this about 1x a week as a treat but I happened to notice its effects on my blood sugar by incident since I have a Lingo and tracked my blood sugar daily.  I‚Äôve tried the flavors Jasmine, Oolong and Vietnamese Coffee. I like the Oolong the best so far ",1,1745283068.0,prediabetes,2,1.0,False

My name is Kait.  I‚Äôm currently 18, turning 19 in early June, and feel as though I lack an outside-of-work-or-online social life.  All of my current friends from high school are wonderful‚Äî However, everybody EXCEPT for me in this group seems to never care for a social life outside of playing games online or calling.  Everyone that I know is very kind, but they refuse to go anywhere (not even to a coffee shop once in a while, to the mall, or anything casual that would involve going outside).   I‚Äôve managed to get some of them to go to the odd concert with me, or to go to a baseball game with me, but it‚Äôs a once-every-few-months ordeal.  I‚Äôm tired of only having friends that refuse to leave the house, and are perfectly fine with never socializing beyond a screen.  I‚Äôll always be close to this group, since I respect and love them as people, but would love another group of friends who still love playing games and whatever, but also love going out and regularly doing other things outside.

I don‚Äôt care for drinking, partying, etc‚Ä¶ Even when I‚Äôm of legal age in less than 2 months, I doubt that I‚Äôll spend most of my time in bars, night clubs, or drinking parties.  I don‚Äôt hate it, and drink on occasions with family, but don‚Äôt care to ‚Äòget wasted‚Äô, do drugs (the only exception being üçÉ‚Äî and, even then, I don‚Äôt want to smoke it (only ever took gummies and hate smoking) or do it to a point where I‚Äôm absolutely out of my mind), or drink on a regular basis.  Wouldn‚Äôt mind the odd fun club night when I‚Äôm legal, but don‚Äôt care for people who only enjoy going places to get drunk and stoned.

I‚Äôm more of a ‚Äògrandma hobbies‚Äô and artistic + writing sort of person, and would love friends with similar interests.  Gaming is still cool, of course (especially people who like the odd session of Minecraft, Roblox, Stardew Valley, Gartic Phone, Nintendo games, etc.), but preferably people who also love OTHER hobbies, such as creative writing, artistic stuff (painting, drawing, music, makeup, etc.), thrifting, and just exploring cool things/going to fun things in and around Toronto.  Random, but I‚Äôm also a big retro (70s-80s-90s) buff.  Not a dealbreaker for me if my friends don‚Äôt care for that stuff, but it is and would be a plus.  LOL!

This isn‚Äôt an offer‚Äî like, I‚Äôm not looking to meet with random people who respond to this post‚Äî however, I am asking if anyone can tell me‚Ä¶ **What social groups, clubs, etc. can I join in either Toronto or around Pickering-Ajax-Whitby that fit my interests, and would give me a chance to regularly meet more people who feel like I do?**  Not looking for dating-related events, but would consider dating a guy (I‚Äôm straight LOL) if we met and really bonded in that way.  Not specifically looking for it, though‚Äî mainly looking for some good, fun friends.

I‚Äôve tried Googling, and have signed up for Meetup, but just feel like I don‚Äôt know where to start or where to look to find the best, most legitimate, and least sketchy options.  Thank you for reading my Ted Talk!

1k4tlh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Anxiety/comments/1k4tlh2/am_i_alone_in_this/,Am I alone in this?,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm a first time mom that 5 moms post partum. I have been diagnosed with post partum anxiety. Even when I post how I feel on mom groups on Facebook none of the moms have said they have felt/acted similar to me. I was just prescribed klonopin today and start that journey tomorrow so if any other moms have taken it I‚Äôd love to hear your feedback/experience!  


In the past 5 months, I have driven my daughter only one time by myself. It was a 3 minute drive to urgent care due to a viral infection and her dr office was close. I have yet to be able to drive her anywhere again by myself. The anxiety of taking her to the grocery store alone, to see family, to literally even drive her to grab myself a coffee absolutely terrifies me. It feels like my whole world is on fire. It‚Äôs a constant fear she will get sick, or we get into a car accident, or just simply leaving my ‚Äúbaby safe environment‚Äù.  If I have to go anywhere or do anything I always make my fianc√© drive us. Yesterday was the first time in 5 months I sat up front while my fianc√© drove instead of right next to her in the back. 

I‚Äôm so scared my anxiety will affect my daughter if I don‚Äôt get it together. I am also a stay at home mom. I refuse to let anyone babysit her even if I leave the house for just an hour. I always need to be inside the same place with her where I can hear her or see her. I did just get prescribed klonopin. I didn‚Äôt want to admit there was something wrong with me or feeling like  a ‚Äúbroken mom.‚Äù I had adhd and have been medicated for that and never once felt less for it. but for some reason admitting that I need anxiety medication to be the mom she deserves is just hard.

Am I alone in this feeling? In these symptoms? In these thoughts? I just want to be able to take her outside and live a functional life with her.",1,1745282946.0,Postpartum_Anxiety,1,1.0,False

Everything was fine until last week when her dog (a pitbull mix idk I don‚Äôt really care about breeds) bit me on the wrist after I tried to drag him off the couch. He growled at me so I grabbed his collar to pull him off (he‚Äôs not allowed on furniture, I made that clear when I moved in) and he just turned and bit me. Not super deep but it bled and now I got this nasty scab and it‚Äôs still sore.

I yelled and kicked the coffee table and the dog ran off and she came running and got all mad at ME like I provoked him or something. I told her that was BS and that the dog is dangerous and we needed to get rid of him, like, either to the pound or sell him to someone who knows how to control animals. She freaked out and said he‚Äôs never bitten anyone in 5 years and that *I* scared him. She wouldn‚Äôt stop crying and made this huge scene like I‚Äôd asked her to shoot the thing or whatever. I said it‚Äôs just a dog, she can get another one later when we have a house and a yard.

She refused, locked herself in the bedroom with the dog (???) and I had to sleep on the couch for 2 nights. I tried to make it right by calling a buddy of mine who works with a breeder and asking if he knew anyone who might take the dog for like $200. I figured I‚Äôd just make the decision and deal with her being mad later since she was acting all emotional and not rational.

Well she found out cause I guess he texted her instead of me (thanks bro) and now she‚Äôs furious, like full-on packing her stuff mad. I told her she was overreacting and this was a HEALTH issue (I could‚Äôve gotten infected or worse!) and that if she was really serious about me she‚Äôd pick my safety over a mutt.

Now she won‚Äôt talk to me and told me to stay at my mom‚Äôs while she ‚Äúthinks things over.‚Äù She‚Äôs posted some passive-aggressive story about betrayal and ‚Äúprotecting those who can‚Äôt speak‚Äù and our friends are blowing up my phone saying I was outta line.

Idk. I still feel like I did what any sane person would do. A dog bites you, you don‚Äôt just ignore it. I didn‚Äôt even HURT the dog. I just tried to move him off furniture that he shouldn't even be on! Am I really the bad guy for trying to sell a dog that BIT me? AITA?",0,1745282864.0,AITAH,5,0.5,False

I was the guy who asked last week for recommendations on etiquette for being invited to a family dinner here in the Netherlands. Thought i might leave a follow-up in case people are curious how it went. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/s/xqDCd7EeCa

So i ended up asking my friend before the dinner for coffee/buy things so she could recommend what to pick up.

After reading everyone's helpful comments i settled on 

Wine (white wine since her family prefers it)
Flower (for the lady of the house)
Pet food (for the doggo and the cat)
Personal gift for my friend. (Music box :))

So i picked up a little music box and headed to her town, met up with her and had a delightful coffee at the canalside under the rare sun.

Afterwards she and i dropped by at a supermarket for white wine under 10euros, some salmon pet food for the doggo and the cat and we picked up some flowers at the flower shop.

I got there and everything went great! (At least i think since I've been invited again). But to be fair i do feel i had the fortune of meeting a rather bohemian family that was more relaxed in general rather than some rigid household. 

I actually mentioned i asked for etiquettes before going, and they basically told me as long as i don't speak with mouthful they don't care. 

The hands above the table (X), no sacred topics (X) (but granted they are a family working in journalist and civil society sector so this one might just be the family i was invited to), no need to refrain from asking for second servings (X) etc.

So I'm invited again, although i offered to cook myself next time and they were more then happy to say yes so i guess it went well! 

Guess my final thoughts now are, just ask whoever invited you for appropriate gifts, dutch people prefer straightforwardness in every aspects and i think that applies for gifts too so they would rather get things they'll actually use/eat, keep the usual social norms in general civil society in mind (you're the guest so try not to speak more than the host or let them lead the conversational topics and try not to come off confrontational in your demeanor etc but that's just being socially aware no?), jokes are always appreciated but make sure if you think they're dicey check with the friend first before saying it just in case, and of course try to make connections with each individual hosts. (Pets count too), Never forget the compliment each dish as they come out (i got the 4 course meal treatment) and offer to help clean afterwards (which i happily did). 

Oh and it didn't apply for me since they told me they're gonna have desserts ready (it was tiramisu and divine) but i do think taking tea/desserts would be a good choice for others. (By offering to bring desserts when invited)

I like games and play on Xbox and PlayStation. Space Marine 2 and Destiny and helldivers 2 are my go-to games. I enjoy shooters and action games and the occasional city builder or rts on pc. Any recommendations are welcome. I'm super excited for the new Doom game.

Was a huge reader until the fire nation blessed me with sudden ADD or HD or 8k or whatever. Still have the Dune sequels to read. Big warhammer 40k novel enjoyer too.

Last night at dinner my 18 month old was playing at my parents coffee table. She was going ""hop hop hop"" with my son's action figure, and then would make it fall down and everyone would go ""OH NO"" and she would bust out laughing. It was hilarious. Somewhere along the way my Mom said that my daughter shouldn't be doing it as she will dent their table -my dad told her to stop being dramatic and continued to play this game.

Fast forward to today - mom sends 2 pics of the table top which definitely has dents. That being said, the entire left side of their table has scratch marks from their dog jumping on to it. It's years old and they were the ones that decided to take the plexiglass topper off knowing it is soft wood. My dad is a carpenter and can easily get these out.

I replied ""guess dad will have some sanding to do. You should put the plexiglass on when the kids come over"" because I'm not going to tell my kids not to play. Also she's 18 months old she's not the incredible Hulk the table clearly needs a topper. And again, it's scratched deep on the other side from their dog.

Anyways, my dad came to drop some stuff off and gave me the silent treatment, didn't stay to chat or have coffee as he usually does. Didn't come in to say hi to the kids, so he's clearly mad.

My parents are in the process of building a house right now so my sister sent a pic of a dinner table to the group chat - I replied with ""better make sure it's made of hardwood"" because at this point I'm annoyed. Mom replies that I'm not funny I reply back saying ""I'm sure she didn't mean to damage your table. If it's a big issue we can have dinners here from now on so the kids don't ruin your house."" Got no response.

I'm genuinely just feeling annoyed, it was an accident and I feel as though they're being ridiculous. It's really rubbing me the wrong way.

I‚Äôve had a lot of experience in my life with women, I‚Äôve used sex workers, dated all types, been a man-whore, I didn‚Äôt lie to anyone in the moment but plenty of girls think I did. I was married before but my ex wife was abusive. Posting here as I know my friends would judge me for what I‚Äôm about to say about a girl, Ana.

A while ago I started seeing Ana who was pure radiance and happiness. She looked and acted much younger but she turned out to be 37. She just exuded so much kindness and life and was so giggly and cute and intelligent. I wanted to date her knowing I was leaving the country in the summer (we met in the spring).

After meeting a few times we had sex because I am forward and know what I am doing, and I could tell she was unprepared and it felt different and she was visibly in pain - I asked what was the matter and she said she was a virgin. It wasn‚Äôt my thing, I prefer slutty girls, but it was an ego boost.

I tried to take her on a date but I started seeing things about her that made me look down on her. She was more nervous around me after we had sex. I saw this shy energy and it irritated me. She‚Äôs also hot but not the hottest I have been with, by a long way. But she was so sexy and sensual, if I‚Äôd only kissed her I‚Äôd have had no idea about her being a virgin. I didn‚Äôt ask about the whys - I know she lost her whole family (parents and two older brothers) in tragic circumstances in her 20s and that took her a lot of time to process - the grief and the admin and having no support network.

After we had sex I noticed a few things that annoyed me so during my last time in town I saw exes who were better in bed, sex workers, but I saw Ana on my last night and ngl my ego wanted to give her something to remember me by.

Anyway to get to the important part we tried doing long distance but I was always talking to other girls. The whole time. I moved to a hot country and there are beautiful women everywhere.

Ana could sense me pulling back - which I was. So she ended it but she was clearly confused and her lack of experience was all too visible because I was manipulating her into thinking she was ending it, when I had already checked out. I made her think I was hurt when I just wanted to be around local girls and my family.

I did offer to fly her out but she said, why couldn‚Äôt I come see her as she couldn‚Äôt leave her building for a few weeks due to renovations. I made some excuse. She was tearful again and she apologised for blowing it with me for not accepting the flyout. She‚Äôd said it seemed like a sex worker offer and that I should be making the moves to see her - so I said ‚Äúsee ya‚Äù. But she wasn‚Äôt wrong, I‚Äôve flown out a lot of girls for the weekend, to hotels and resorts. Ana didn‚Äôt want that.

Then she booked tickets and an apartment in my country (it‚Äôs a 13h+ flight) and sent me a picture of her in my town and said did I want to have coffee. I was so mad and said I‚Äôm not seeing you (she left it too late and my attraction had died), and looking back I can imagine how devastating that must have been for her, to just go home alone.

Anyway cut to one year later and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about Ana. 

I am obsessed with her. The hotter women have become boring and seem shallow, or they want something out of me which I have the means to give but I don‚Äôt want that kind of relationship.

Ana had soul, she loved me for me, her mistakes were out of awkwardness. I‚Äôve seen pictures of her and she is not recognisable from how she was when we first met and she bounded towards me with a huge smile. She looks scarily thin, and dead inside. I know from her last video that she was struggling mentally, I saw a mark on her arm that suggests self-harm, and I know it is because of me. She said 

She‚Äôs funny, intelligent, kind, wealthy, sensual and giving so she will have no problems finding a new guy if she hasn‚Äôt already, but I know that I hurt her by acting like an asshole. More than that I miss her.

[[Explore Top Rated breville refurbished on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=breville refurbished)
## The Appeal of a Breville on a Budget

LetS face it: Breville appliances are undeniably desirable. They're the workhorses of many a modern kitchen,capable of producing caf√©-quality espresso,perfectly toasted bread,and flawlessly blended smoothies. The challenge,though,lies in their initial cost. A new Breville espresso machine or smart oven can represent a significant investment.The promise of acquiring that same Breville quality at a fraction of the price is what makes the idea of a *Breville discounted* or *cheap Breville* appliance so tempting.

For the *budget-conscious home chefs* out there,this is especially appealing. It allows you to elevate your culinary game without breaking the bank. Imagine finally owning that Breville stand mixer you've been dreaming about, but without the financial strain. Similarly, for *entry-level enthusiasts* eager to explore the world of gourmet coffee or advanced baking, a *refurbished Breville* can be the perfect entry point, allowing you to experiment without committing to the full retail price. And perhaps,if you run a small cafe,you might be searching for *refurbished Breville commercial models* that are not only reliable but also cost-effective.

## Defining ""Refurbished"": What to Expect

Before we go any further, it's crucial to understand what ""Breville refurbished"" actually means. When you see terms like *certified refurbished Breville*, *reconditioned Breville*, or even *Breville open box*, it's vital to know what you‚Äôre getting.

Generally, a refurbished appliance is one that has been returned to the manufacturer (or a certified third-party) for various reasons. These reasons might include:

*   **Cosmetic imperfections:** Minor scratches or dents that don't affect performance.*   **Customer returns:** Appliances returned due to buyer's remorse or simply not meeting expectations.
*   **Slight malfunctions:** Issues that have been repaired and brought back to working order.

A reputable refurbishment process should involve thorough inspection, repair of any faults, cleaning, and testing. In the best-case scenario, the appliance is brought back to near-new condition.

I‚Äôm kind of struggling on what to do honestly. We went out on a date, went great, but both of us sort of ended things after. Yet we clearly like each other.


So this is what has happened. The first time I managed to get to talk to her I also taught her how to play piano. I played Thousand Years for her and sang it. Then I tried to teach her how to play it. She couldn‚Äôt manage it (obvious for a new player) so I took her hands and played it with my hands on top of hers. Then we tried it on a duet. She was too shy to sing so that was funny. 

Then we went out for coffee and we walked around talking about random stuff. Then hung out in my car for a while listening to each other‚Äôs playlists. She kept on stealing glances at me when her songs were playing to see if I liked it. But always turned away when I turned my head towards her. I got the feeling she was really interested but maybe got in her own head about things. I might be realizing that I can be a bit too straight forward and maybe intimidating. So I dunno if she got the wrong idea about me. 

I invited her to do more things but she didn‚Äôt really get back to me. Everyone else tells me that she is too shy and to give her time. But when we did get to talk she told me she was also talking to another guy. And that she didn‚Äôt want to date two people at once. I thought she was too shy and wasn‚Äôt sure if I even liked her. She reminds me a lot of my ex and I think my feelings for her might be spilling over. They are very similar. 

So we ended off not continuing anything on both sides. But we kept on being the same around each other. Sometimes I mess with her and tease her. I can make her smile and laugh easily and I know she likes that. Recently I‚Äôve been trying to get her to interact with me more. One thing I do is to mess around with her hair which she says she doesn‚Äôt like but can‚Äôt stop smiling when I do it. Sometimes she hits me back lightly after I do it. 

There‚Äôs more but I can‚Äôt really describe them all that well. Not sure what to do. Just planning to keep being me. ",1,1745280909.0,bodylanguage,0,1.0,False

# Why These IPTV Providers Stand Out in 2025?

Look, I get it‚Äîchoosing the **best IPTV service** can feel overwhelming. Some providers claim to have ""50,000 channels"" but end up being a pixelated mess. Others have great streams but no support when things go wrong.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve personally tested these services, checking:  
‚úî **Reliability** ‚Äì No one likes buffering mid-game.  
‚úî **Channel selection** ‚Äì More isn‚Äôt always better, but quality + quantity is key.  
‚úî **Customer support** ‚Äì Because tech fails happen.  
‚úî **Multi-device support** ‚Äì Because you shouldn‚Äôt be stuck watching on just one screen.

# Final Thoughts

If you‚Äôre serious about streaming in 2025, **IPTVGREAT**, [**IPTVUnlock**](http://iptvunlock.com), and **IPTVGang** are the top dogs for a reason. They deliver where others fail, and honestly? They‚Äôll save you from the headache of unreliable streams.

But don‚Äôt just take my word for it‚Äîgive them a shot and see the difference for yourself.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**1. What makes IPTV GREAT the best IPTV provider in 2025?**  
Great question! IPTV GREAT tops my list because it offers **140,000+ live channels**, a **100,000+ VOD library**, and *anti-freeze tech* to eliminate buffering. Plus, their 24/7 human support is a game-changer‚Äîno more chatbots ghosting you mid-crisis. They‚Äôve been #1 for three years straight, and after testing them myself, I get why.

**2. Are these IPTV services legal?**  
The short answer: It depends. Some providers operate legally by licensing content, while others fall into a gray area. Always check local laws and use a **VPN** for added privacy. I only recommend services with transparent practices, like the ones on this list, but it‚Äôs smart to do your own research too.

**3. Will these IPTV providers work on my Firestick/Android/Smart TV?**  
Absolutely! All 15 providers on my list are **multi-device compatible**, including Firestick, Android, iOS, and Smart TVs. IPTV GREAT even runs on older devices (yes, even that tablet collecting dust in your drawer).

**4. How do I avoid buffering with IPTV?**  
Buffering is the worst, right? Here‚Äôs how to beat it:

* Use a **wired connection** (or 5GHz Wi-Fi if wireless).
* Pick providers with **anti-freeze tech** (like IPTV GREAT).
* Close background apps hogging bandwidth.

**5. What‚Äôs the difference between these premium picks and free IPTV services?**  
Free services might *seem* tempting, but they‚Äôre notorious for **downtime**, sketchy security, and missing channels. The providers I‚Äôve listed offer **reliability**, huge content libraries, and actual customer support‚Äîworth every penny for serious streamers.

**6. Do I need a VPN for IPTV?**  
I *highly* recommend one, especially if you‚Äôre streaming geo-restricted content or want extra privacy. Some ISPs throttle IPTV traffic, and a VPN helps bypass that. Plus, it‚Äôs just safer.

**7. Which provider is best for sports fans?**  
Hands down, **IPTV GREAT**. They offer **4K sports streams**, zero lag on live games, and every league/PPV event you can think of. IPTV Unlock (my backup pick) is also solid for sports, with fewer channels but great stability.

**8. Can I test these services before committing?**  
Yep! Most premium providers (including IPTV GREAT) offer **free trials** or **money-back guarantees**. Always test a service during peak hours to check for buffering‚ÄîI learned that the hard way.

**9. What‚Äôs the average cost for these top-tier IPTV services?**  
Prices vary, but expect **$10‚Äì$20/month** for the best ones. Cheaper than cable, and you get *way* more content. Pro tip: Annual plans often save you 30‚Äì50%.

**10. Why should I trust your recommendations?**  
Fair ask! I‚Äôve spent *years* testing IPTV services‚Äîthe good, the bad, and the downright scammy. Every provider on this list has been vetted for **speed, content variety, and customer support**. No fluff, just real results.

So for background, me and my ex were going really well. I mean the dates were beyond magical we're talking Disney movie stuff in live action (and it being successful, taking a jab at you Disney live-action box office flops.) The week of my birthday, everything was going swell. We talked about plans and everything for what we were going to do. 2 days before my birthday, mentally he wasn't well so I left him alone while he could gather his thoughts. When I did, I was making plans behind his back so when I saw him on my birthday it could make his day and brighten up whatever had him down, making my birthday as much as it was for me, for him too. Getting him a ring pop since it was an inside joke between us, a lil book surprise and a coffee for him just to brighten his mood. Anything I could do to brighten him up and share my birthday with him. A lil mental getaway and make that day an escape for us. Day of the birthday, I weirdly could tell something was off: his happy birthday wasn't a ""Happy Birthday I cant wait to see you! Ive missed talking to you yadayada."" It was just a ""Happy birthday."" Mind you me and him haven't talked in two days and he usually tended to send like paragraphs confessing his feelings as good morning texts. 

I ended up asking about if we were on for today, and he cancelled the whole date we had planned for frankly, weeks. I had a gut feeling he wanted to breakup, just with him cancelling and not offering an alternative like: ""Lets ft and do XYZ! Or let's play video games to cheer you up!"" Sadly he had informed me that it's been on his mind since he has to improve himself and it's more of a him thing of figuring himself out compared to an actual problem with our relationship. At best he was able to offer how terrible he feels that it had to happen today of all days and how I should try to stay positive even though I planned my whole day around being with him. Despite all this, we are on good terms and in no way is he at fault for anything because that'd be immature and selfish not to understand what he's going through even though I know nothing about it and talks of rekindling when he figures himself out have been brought because it's not like he chose to go through something and had it happen on the worst day possible. It's a double-edged sword. I will never be mad at him nor sad at him as a person, only the action of it happening. Kinda separating art from the artist if that makes sense in a convoluted analogy.

Now this is where you come in REDDIT. Just is it weird im still an emotional wreck over everything? Just the fact that we had to breakup on my birthday because of what's happening with him or is am I overreacting for being an emotional wreck, because he's told me on numerous occasions of how I did nothing wrong, I was amazing and he wouldn't trade it for anything else but just deep down, I just feel still so hurt that all I wanted for my 22nd birthday was to spend it with him in some caliber especially with the plans and ideas I wanted to make and frankly my whole birthday weekend I was and frankly still am: an emotional rollercoaster even though we're on good terms and neither of us have any ill will towards the other because its life giving us a middle finger.

Over the past four years, I‚Äôve been stuck in tutorial hell‚Äîwatching endless courses, getting certifications, but never landing a full-time job. Here's how it happened:

## Year 1: The Beginning

Started with web development and cloud computing when the tech was booming in Corona-era.

Failed to build anything real.

Tutorials promised jobs after 10+ hour videos.

I believed it.


## Year 2-3: Network Engineering Phase

Shifted to networking, got AWS and CCNA certified.

Thought certifications would help.

By then, COVID-era remote jobs were fading, and competition was up.


## The Harsh Reality

Tutorials didn‚Äôt match interview expectations.
I was unprepared.

Thought the solution was more tutorials. So I watched more.

Built cloned projects that everyone else built‚Äîcompanies don‚Äôt care.

Switched to documentation hoping it would help.

Just a different type of loop. Still lost.


# Why Tutorials Failed Me

They never teach real-world problem solving.

They sell dreams‚Äî‚Äúcomplete this and you‚Äôll earn $100k.‚Äù

Interviews now demand experience, originality, not tutorial projects.

I had no mentor, no guidance, just trial and error.


# The India-Specific Struggle

No CS degree, not from a reputed college.

Most companies don‚Äôt care about certificates.

Remote junior roles are disappearing.

Rejections everywhere‚Äîeven for entry-level onsite jobs.


# What I‚Äôm Doing Now

Shifting focus to:

DSA preparation

Open-source contributions

Building real-world projects (from scratch, with real problems)


# No more copy-paste projects.

Interviews are my new tutorial‚Äîevery failure teaches something.

Still applying. Still trying. Still learning.


# Final Words

If you're stuck in tutorial hell, get out now.
Start building. Start failing. Start learning for real.
And if someday, we both succeed‚Äîlet‚Äôs meet for a cup of coffee and talk about how far we‚Äôve come.",2,1745280653.0,learnprogramming,4,0.67,False

A couple weeks ago, I'm helping in my grandparents in the garage with my partner. I walk by my grandmother's mustang and I say, ""Dammit that thing is orange."" At this point my partner stops and starts laughing and just says. ""I feel so validated.""
The back story with this car is that I described it to her as a red car and when I showed up in it to help her with a college photo shoot, she got kinda mad because I told her it was red and she kept insisting it was orange. I always thought it had a bit of orange flake in it, but would only see it in direct sunlight. I even went home and had the discussion with my father after this day, and he thought the same thing about the color, but my stepmother was in the its an orange car camp.
Well I can indeed confirm the car is orange now. Since this time I started looking at my mother's paint samples and I can actually see the difference in color between the different shades more clearly, I don't have to focus so much. 
This got me into experimenting with other things that can change such as taste and my first thought was pickels, as ive seen the trans girl to pickle got line. And yes I can eat a pickle now. I've had 4 no eat foods on my list pickles, mushrooms, olives, & coffee. While I can stand pickles, olives, mushrooms now. They're a trama food so still can't bring myself to eat. (Was never a real picky eater, but all three of these would make me want to gag as soon as I tasted it, and my parents for some odd reason would force me to eat it. So while I find I can stand the taste now, the want to gage is still prevalent. More then likely trauma response.)

Now coffee on the other hand I have always avoided for not liking the taste. Several different partners have had me sample their favorite drink and I'd always call it burnt water. Well I finally walk into coffee shop with partner saw an espresso that sounded good and decided to have her order it. Ever since we have enjoyed drinking espresso while chatting at Wednesday brunch. 

And last but not least my attitude has brightend up. I always kinda felt like Bruce Banner in the avengers, I'm always angry. Just out words I'm remaining calm and composed. I would still have laughs and fun. But I was constantly keeping my anger in check. I don't feel that way anymore and generally feel I have a brighter perspective on things. This has helped with me sticking to my self care routine. Also tend to be able to experience a wide range of emotions. This helps me process my partners emotions as well.

Overall I'm just trying to say while the physical changes are awesome, these minor changes to the way I preceive the world are probably the best of hrt.",2,1745280653.0,MtF,0,0.75,False

I wasn't treated fair in my childhood and was constantly harassed about it by my parents primarily, and my schoolmates too. When I was 15, i seeked help best I knew how at that time, but my psychologist only said it will diminish with age. I was actually looking forward to that, but guess fucking what. My tics are motor, and they are bad. There have only been a handful of short periods when things got better, but they never go away. The problem is, since early age, i developed this kind of denial coping mechanism and a huge shame and complexes, so when i have tics around people, i am ONLY focused on hiding it and it is so exshausting. I never ever (until few days ago) googled it, monitored, or wanted to know anything about it. The word tic triggered me emotionally so bad, but i am getting used to it now.

Now, about the headline - yes, in past year, especially past few month, they are getting progressivly worse. I can't go out to take a fucking walk without twiching and being in fight or flight because someone might see me. My head hurts, my neck is killing me, i am spilling my coffee regularly and my eyes hurt. I have completely distanced myself from people. There is no way I go in public if i don't have to. Oh and lately i've been ticcin in my SLEEP! 

I need help. Since i am in such oblivion about what causes it for me and what could help, please do recommend something. What's changed that might have triggered them? I am emotionally and academically stressed but not so much more like usually, just a little. I did get depression and some unresolved relationship issues and i procrastinate more.
I don't think they are really stress induced, more like physical arrousal induced. The sad thing is they are only rare when i'm sad. They used to be absent in the morning at least, but now i get them even then, even in my sleep.

Btw. I am a phd psychologist and am familiar with stress, relaxation techniques and so on but still, i need some guidlines. i am falling apart. It's taken over me. I dont know how to fix it if i am so traumatised.

TL;DR my motor tics are getting worse fast and idk what to do. Also i am so traumatised and embarrased that it makes trying stuff much harder",3,1745280468.0,Tourettes,0,1.0,False
1k4sr2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1k4sr2y/deciding_between_zerno_z1_vs_lagom_p64_from_a/,Deciding between Zerno Z1 vs Lagom P64 from a Eureka Mignon XL [$2000],"Hello - I currently have a Eureka Oro Mignon XL - but I'm looking to get grinder with a better single dose workflow and one that more easily allows me to switch between beans and between espresso and filter coffee.  I primarily make low-volume milk drinks (cortados / flat whites) and my workflow is almost always two shots back to back, making coffee for myself and my wife.

I'm heavily torn between the Lagom P64 and the Zerno Z1. I know that, on paper, these are both highly capable grinders, so the differences are really in the minutia. But that's what I'm trying to decide between here! I like the look of both, leaning towards the Zerno.

Does any have experience between both grinders? I'm really interested to hear in the day-to-day workflow and usage of both with things like

* workflow specifics (catch cup, getting grinds out of funnel, RDT required, etc)
* ease of cleaning
* long term notes
* ability to switch between espresso and filter easily (consistent grind settings)



Also, I'm not considering the Mazzer Philos - I know it's a grinder often recommended in this price range, but it's too large for me and I think it would look awkward in my space. I also know that one of the major negatives of the Zerno is the long ordering lead time. Because I already have a grinder, I'm not concerned about that.

1k4sq88,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1k4sq88/roommate_got_weirdly_controlling_after_my_partner/,Roommate got weirdly controlling after my partner moved in,"Back when I was still in college, I lived in an apartment. I had struggled to quickly find a roommate and leave my previous apartment situation (previous roommate smoked weed and the smell triggered overstimulation meltdowns for me, so it was a bad match to say the least), then I met (I‚Äôm using fake name for her) Brie. We got along pretty well, both of us still students, both ADHD. I quickly considered her a good friend.
We watched and sent each other tiktoks, we laughed and talked about guys she saw on Hinge, we bonded over a lot of conversations we had together.
We had a good dynamic, but my bf got weird vibes from her. He tried to make conversation but her energy would always drastically change when he entered the room.
He picked up on underhanded comments she would make, comments that I didn‚Äôt often pick up on. One that I did pick up on cut me deep at a time when I was sensitive and vulnerable about the topic. I was excitedly prepping for a session of Dungeons and Dragons, and I did what I thought was a fun kind of creepy makeup bc I was gonna run a Halloween session. I asked her what she thought bc she really enjoyed makeup. She looked at me and said ‚Äúit looks like my little sister did it‚Äù
Not knowing Brie‚Äôs little sister, I didn‚Äôt know if I should take the comment the way it sounded or if I was missing something. Regardless, I felt gutted. I tried to smile so as to not show how hurt I felt and I just said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to take that.‚Äù
I retreated to my room as discreetly as possible and started to cry. Thankfully my Bf came to check on me and reassured me. That‚Äôs a moment he still thinks about when the topic of Brie comes up bc he was mad that Brie hurt me so casually with an insensitive-at-best comment.
Later on, he moved in bc we still needed another roommate and he and I wanted to live together anyways. Brie had said she was fine with this, but her behavior started to change. She started getting more controlling of things in the apartment. One night, bf tried talking to Brie about the window blinds. Bf had a lot of anxiety about leaving the blinds open bc we lived in a city area and he worried that someone would look in on our apartment, Brie insisted on leaving the blinds open bc she needed light when she leaves for work in the mornings.
‚ÄúWhy not just turn the light on?‚Äù I asked
She said she just preferred the natural light.
After trying to talk through it for a little bit, she disengaged from the conversation and went to bed. Bf took that as her relenting, so he closed the blinds and we went to go to bed. About 10 minutes later Bf thinks he hears Brie open the blinds. So he gets up to go see if he heard correctly, and he did. She waited until she thought we were asleep to go and open the blinds.
He comes back after closing the blinds again.
Not one minute later, BRIE OPENS THE BLINDS AGAIN
Cue an almost comical back and forth of those two narrowly avoiding each other while opening/closing the blinds, this went on for a half hour I swear. 
Bf and I both had our times of being a little less than mature about Brie‚Äôs bids for control.
In one instance, Brie kept trying to hide the remote to the living room tv. I still don‚Äôt know why. I would go to the living room, having left the remote on the coffee table the night before, only to find it tucked away and hidden behind a purse she had been meaning to sell (ONCE SHE HID THE REMOTE INSIDE THAT PURSE!)
I got petty and started leaving the remote surrounded by candles/other objects in such a way that would 1) indicate I knew she had been moving it and so I was deliberately placing it somewhere specific, and 2) make it so she would have to move the things I put around it in order to move the remote.
In all these instances, she wasn‚Äôt even watching tv before going to work! She would just wake up, get ready for work, hide the remote, and leave for work! So I finally decided to confront her in as non-confrontational a way as I could (while also being petty and trying to catch her off guard bc, yeah I wasn‚Äôt being mature about it)
So when she got home from work, I was like ‚Äúhey, were you watching tv this morning?‚Äù
She looked confused and said ‚Äúno‚Äù
So I was like ‚Äúoh, why did you move the remote, then?‚Äù
A brief pause, and she said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt‚Äù but I knew she was lying.
Months later our lease ended and Bf and I had to move back to our respective hometowns bc we couldn‚Äôt afford to live in that city anymore. The day I sent Brie her portion of the refunded security deposit, she unfriended us on every bit of social media we were mutuals on. She didn‚Äôt say any sort of goodbye. Just silently cut ties once she got her money.
Glad she‚Äôs not in our lives anymore, but sometimes I still think about how absurd things got with her.

I purchased a large coffee table that arrived with a broken leg. Because of how heavy and unstable it was, I physically could not move it to inspect the rest of the table without risking more damage. It took two months for a repair technician to show up. Only after the repair was I finally able to move the table and discovered that multiple corners were completely crushed, with the wood visibly split.

I submitted a follow-up claim with photos. They denied it, saying the damage was not reported within 24 hours of delivery. That policy makes no sense when the damage could not have been discovered without first fixing the broken leg.

When I called customer service, the representative told me she personally empathized and would feel the same way if it happened to her, but said she could not do anything. I told her I was leaving the call as an extremely unsatisfied customer and that I would never recommend TOV to anyone. I also said I would share this experience online. Her response was that she still could not do anything.

This company wasted months of my time and left me with a visibly damaged, unusable table. The customer service may sound sympathetic, but in the end, they are dismissive and unhelpful.

So I‚Äôve been in a relationship with this girl. We‚Äôve had some good moments lately‚Äîshe even treated me to coffee and chicken pastil before we visited both our grandparents‚Äô graves sa Eternal Garden. I felt really happy that time kasi parang ang ayos ng lahat.

Pero lately, sobrang gulo na.

She started acting distant. Naging madalas ang away, tapos parang ako na lang palagi ang mali. She‚Äôd curse at me over small things, minsan napapasobra‚Äîtapos pag nag-sorry ako or nag explain, she‚Äôd say things like, ‚ÄúTangina isip bata mo,‚Äù or ‚ÄúThen leave.‚Äù

One time I misunderstood her notes post‚Äîsaying things like ‚Äúumay,‚Äù ‚Äúnagsisisi,‚Äù etc. I asked her kung okay lang ba siya, and instead of opening up, she got angry. Later on I found out na she‚Äôs been having problems with her friends, and parang ako nadadamay sa stress niya.

I‚Äôve tried to be understanding. I compliment her, support her, even made her a school project (she jokingly called me ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù after that). Pero kahit anong lambing or effort, parang lagi akong boring sa paningin niya.

Recently, I found out may secret account siya with thirst traps and ‚Äúdate me‚Äù captions. That really broke me. She even denied na kami daw when talking to someone else.

I‚Äôm always giving, pero wala naman akong natatanggap. Puro siya pangako na ‚Äúbabawi ako,‚Äù pero wala akong nararamdamang pagbabago.

Gusto ko pa siya. Ayoko pa makipaghiwalay kasi I‚Äôm still hoping‚Ä¶ pero deep down, I feel like ginagamit na lang ako.

1. The Stew Crew is teasing another big trip.  After Dubai and a Disney cruise... it must be Hawaii.  No matter where they are, Layla and Zade are expected to work.  They are busy pushing the new God cartoon app and are getting good at pretending to like it.  Layla has to slum it at the boutique this week with her mom, Aunt Whitney and cousin Khloe.  She models for the new Mommy and Me line the Boutique is launching and you can almost hear Alyssa‚Äôs screams slam from Orlando.  Layla really plays up to the camera, while Khloe is more reserved and smiles sheepishly.  All of the boutique employees cheer Layla on, and that‚Äôs all of the payment she requires at this young age.  Carlin is hell bent on the world knowing she‚Äôs exercising and shows off her Pilates gear day after day.  At her monthly baby appointment, she films the heartbeat at 147 and asks what everyone‚Äôs guess is for gender...then has brunch with Evan the thumb who she calls ‚Äúhandsome‚Äù.  Back at the home studio, Layla has just about perfected her lines for the bi-monthly ‚Äúdaddy‚Äôs little princess‚Äù reel.  We see Carlin getting her all dressed for ballet pictures, and Layla is excited for her full face of makeup.  Layla twirls, sings and plays for the camera while Evan and his smarmy grin look on.  Dude is laughing all the way to the bank.  The reel has almost 500 comments and has been shared over 7,000 times just on instagram. You have to wonder if Layla will be embarrassed as she grows up and has people feel like they know her... know everything about her... come up to her and ask her personal things?  The comments are as creepy as ever with people saying they ‚Äúwant her‚Äù, ‚Äúshe has my heart‚Äù, someone even goes off about how she is being raised to be Biblically feminine and how the desire to be delighted in starts so young. Creepy as hell... and SO many people ‚Äúcrying‚Äù. 55,000 likes for one very exploited child.  Later we see Layla at the dance studio posing for her pictures while Zade sits and watches.  The Stew Crew vlogs have been leveling out over on YouTube.  They are averaging right around 100,000 views per week, so Carlin promotes all of the old vlogs while showing both kids sitting on Evan‚Äôs lap as he edits. Carlin says they are working with him, but they are both glued to the ipad that is set up beside his laptop.  The weekly vlog is a mashup of events from the last several weeks that they have already shown... trips to the dentist, Evan‚Äôs play practice, Layla at dance.  Zade is still getting subtitles, and Carlin says at the end of his 4 week swimming lesson, he should be swimming without a floatie.  Does that mean he won‚Äôt get more than 4 weeks?  They continue to talk about their upcoming trip and the long plane ride they have to make to get there.  Evan talks again about working with the Youth at his church.  We see more of Carlin‚Äôs birthday, including Warden walking in and going right to their fridge as if he lives there... and maybe he does.  Carlin films herself wallowing around on the floor of her bedroom to link water jugs and phone cases.  She gives a close up of her unbuttoned jeans while showing off her baby bump and says they will take viewers along on their upcoming bucket list trip.  The kids get their Easter baskets early and pick up eggs Evan tossed all over their astro turf.  They seem to have brand new pool furniture and Layla has a new bob haircut.  The Stewarts attend their church‚Äôs Sunrise Service and Carlin gets plenty of shots of Layla kissing her belly while they are in matching outfits.  From the upcoming line at BSB... of course!





2.  Baby Harvey Clark is 6.5 months old now, and Katie says she is soaking up all of the baby love before he grows up.  The kid is the oldest baby ever.  Once again the Clarks are out at a store late at night with 2 sleepy kids... this time to buy Easter supplies.  Back at home, Katie shows off her disgusting high chair cover to sell stain treatment.  A blow out obviously happened on the cover, but nothing is too low for these fools to show for a dollar.  Hailey is becoming an expert level giggler, and Katie catches almost all of them on film.  The weekly vlog shows Erin driving the Clarks to the airport after their cruise.  We even see Katie and Erin hug, so that feud is obviously over.  Back at the new mcmansion, a solid white couch has been delivered and Katie is beaming.  Remi the dog is climbing all over the stark white behemoth, but no worries bc Katie says it‚Äôs a great fabric that resists stains.  Nothing screams ‚Äúwe have tons of disposable income‚Äù like buying a white piece of furniture when you have 2 toddlers and a big ole dog.  Speaking of Remi, Warden is now the dog sitter when the family is away... sounds like he really is couch surfing.  Hailey has to show up and sell the dog food that is sponsoring this yawnfest, and then she has to star in the feature presentation... a day at the zoo.  Katie and Travis haven‚Äôt even unpacked from the cruise, but content doesn‚Äôt stop, so it‚Äôs off to the Knoxville Zoo where Hailey screams, claps and giggles and Katie carries the baby around in her overalls.  They only take one stroller, so Hailey doesn‚Äôt have a choice but to walk around performing.  Travis says there was a ton of packages waiting for them when they got back home, and after that humble brag, we learn that he took off to South Carolina alone to meet up with his family and record some new music.  He tells us they will spend the weekend working at the big house on a project Gil is undertaking and Katie talks about how much she adores the fact that Travis is able to help her family.  They show their trip to Target again, where Katie says she never got an Easter basket, and never dyed eggs.  Travis‚Äô mom had to guide her through it.  Travis wants everyone to stream some cover of a song he is singing with another gospel group.  Their vlogs, just like the Stew Crew, are only averaging about 100,000 views per week.  On Easter Sunday Katie matches with Hailey and Harvey matches Travis. We see Hailey with her brand new King James Version, monogrammed Bible... just what every toddler needs.




3.  Josie Balka continues to fine tune her influencing.  Her latest trick is to use a thumbnail of her children at the beginning of a mini vlog that has absolutely nothing to do with her kids to draw in the views.  This is a telltale sign that she knows what sells.  The mini vlog is just another GRWM for church where she‚Äôs in a breakneck hurry but still ends up looking like a glamazon at the end.  Josie spends pretty much every day selling makeup and drinking coffee... we haven‚Äôt even seen Kelton in the kitchen lately.  She films the same things over and over and over... including another morning routine vlog.  People ask about washing her hair after a workout, about wearing the pool noodle constantly, and if she can please film a morning routine with the girls.  She‚Äôs back to hawking the travel bag she took on the cruise and while showing it off, we see that the Balkas flew Comfort Plus... a step up from economy.  She keeps rerunning the same old ad for the grocery delivery service, and has a new link to push... H&M.  The Balka girls attend the new cult church‚Äôs Easter Egg hunt, and then spend some time with Kelton‚Äôs dad.  On Easter Sunday the family poses outside of the church dressed in their beigiest beige and the big news is that Josie finally got a hold of Kelton‚Äôs beaver tail eyebrows and waxed those suckers within an inch of his life.  Also, she has discovered the Kim K. clear heels circa 2010 just like Carlin.  Speaking of Carlin, Josie snaps a picture of her girls with cousin Layla.  Hazel is the same height as Layla now.  Later, the girls have the most depressing egg hunt ever featuring white plastic eggs.  They are wearing all white and seem to be out at their new property.  Josie still hasn‚Äôt revealed if the new dream home is under construction yet.




4. Ellie Bates has pingpong‚Äôed between Erin and Alyssa for several weeks now, and finally landed at Alyssa‚Äôs.  She poses with the Webster clan in the flower bed at their church.  Alyssa has the girls dressed like the dead of winter in deep red, while Rhett is in a full black suit.  Of course Alyssa poses alone with Prince Rhett.  Alyssa takes to her instagram to whine about her broken apple watch... she says she used to never wear it because she never left the house.  Yea, we know.  Now she walks with the girls every evening and the watch is broken... she asks for advice. This is really just an old influencer ploy to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù the algorithm, because a bit later, she is back shilling house plants, trying her damndest to sound excited about them.  Almost every day she shows off her iced coffee from her favorite coffee shop, and she‚Äôs tickled to tell everyone about her kids free pup cups. Thursday is co-op day for the Websters and Alyssa gets to take a ton of pictures of the golden child while he makes a variety of ugly faces for his mom to filter... and she records him saying his name, which is the most we have ever heard him speak.  Alyssa says she just loves making Easter baskets for her kids, but then complains about how expensive it is when you have multiple kids... as if these kids were forced on her (maybe they were??).  Anyway, she‚Äôs happy to report that they are all getting crap from Dollar Tree in their baskets.  She spent about 6 bucks a basket... the same amount she spends every day at the dern coffee shop.  The Webster kids have been exploited since birth, but every holiday they get the absolute worst stuff.  On Easter weekend, the family loads up in the car, with John at the wheel in his sad hat. Alyssa forces the girls to wear the coffee shop hats and give their usual terrified smiles.  Later she filters their noses off.  The kids get their Easter baskets early and the fake smiles are back.  The 3 oldest girls are all dressed alike, and even though Allie is a voracious reader, she is gifted a thin little Dollar Store God story book.  Alyssa gets to wear her DC prom dress again on Resurrection Sunday, and models in the doorway with the girls. Rhett is in a full suit complete with a pocket square, as if his Social Security check is on the way.  Lurch only poses individually with the prince.




5. Zach Bates is another week in to his newest gig as a full time content creator.  He is getting great at posting his meals and reposting any and everything his mom or wife post.  Whitney says they are getting new windows and gutters installed at their house, and she is hiding from all of that commotion by heading to a photo shoot at the boutique.  They are shooting for their new Mommy and Me campaign, but only Khloe gets to come... even though Whitney has 3 daughters.  Zach has a new $1000 flat top griddle, gifted to him by the company and he films himself putting it together.  He would like you to buy one using his code.  While Zach is outside filming himself with a grill, Whitney is inside shilling school. That‚Äôs right... she wants to sell you home school.  She says her curriculum is the best because it focuses on what is important... Bible verses and living a Christian life.  She says it isn‚Äôt important to just check off boxes.  What about the box that says ‚ÄúI am a critical thinker‚Äù or the box for ‚ÄúI can read and write a complex sentence‚Äù?  Aren‚Äôt those a wee bit important too??  Later in the week Zach is up at the big house helping Gil with a ‚Äúhouse he‚Äôs fixing up‚Äù.... what house?  He says lots of the family is in from out of town, but we only ever see Lawson.  Are they working on the old/back half of the big house, or is this another structure on the property?  Is this a house for Isaiah, perhaps? He shows them tearing out the old roof and Gil complaining about spending money on new lumber.  Whitney reposts Zach‚Äôs banana pudding recipe that is topped with caramel for some reason, and she has a link to the same travel bag Josie has been pushing. Everything in Whit‚Äôs bag is linked for your convenience.  Zach seems to have donated his old flat top griddle to the big house and he cooks brunch for the work crew that seems to only be him and his dad with JedJub.  Whitney is last minute Easter shopping for her crew, but she ain‚Äôt at the Dollar Tree.  Momma is at Target.  The Bates Kitchen features Warden outside with Zach cooking on his new grill.  Warden has surprised his brother with an outdoor counter and cabinet that he built all on his own.  They are attempting to cook smash burgers like Freddie‚Äôs, but Zach forgets to season the patties, and is whopping out tons of beef fat to fry his french fries in. Erin would like to add essential oils to that and sell it Zach... and here you are just wasting it!  We get to listen as he scrapes and cleans the grill and at the end he fishes around in a pickle jar with his bare hands and dips a half eaten burger into a shared cup of fry sauce.  It is truly like cooking with cavemen.  Anyway, Warden says he is happy to be the family‚Äôs handyman now that Chad has left the area, and his favorite project was Carlin‚Äôs fireplace.  Warden reveals why he is always getting caught liking internet hotties‚Äô posts when he tells us all that it is super hard for him to say no. Kacie shows up to help her dad promote the new time for his weekly vlog to drop and he links Sonic brand pudding in his banana pudding recipe. Both Whitney and Zach share the kids at their church egg hunt and all dressed up for Easter Sunday in shades of purple. They also have a photo shoot with Gil and Kelly Jo, who hosted Easter lunch.




6. Michael and Brandon are celebrating ten years since the most awkward engagement ever televised by going out for ice cream after church.  The excitement!  Michael shares a selfie with baby Miles Balka who seems to be her favorite.  Josie calls her the best auntie in the world.  The Keilens drive to Michigan for Easter with Brandon‚Äôs family and Michael has a q and a on the way.  She says Momma Jane is making it through her cancer treatments, Josie helped her with her makeup routine and she uses Erin‚Äôs beef fat on her face.  The big news is that she says they are now ‚Äúlicensed and trained‚Äù for adoption.  She doesn‚Äôt clarify where or what this license and training is from or for.  She says they really want to adopt, but are praying about their next steps.  She also reveals that Brandon is working in quality control for a construction supply company.  Later, she shares pictures from a trip to Florida to meet Brandon‚Äôs sister‚Äôs new baby.  She reshares Brandon‚Äôs coloring project of the Easter story and shares a picture of him while piling on the praise.  She talks about his precious dimple and how happy she is to call him ‚Äúhers‚Äù (Hear that TORI?!) Michael wears a floor length dress with a modesty panel for Easter Sunday in Michigan




7. Lydia Bates is still celebrating her birthday, this time with a party at her family‚Äôs home.  Trace and Ryker pose for church pictures at Bible Baptist, stomping around in the freshly planted flower beds.  Lydia films herself every day working out, playing with Ryker, napping and cleaning house.  Her big project for the week is washing all of the baby‚Äôs clothes and filming the cat napping in the sun.  She posts a mini vlog talking about her 32nd week of pregnancy and guess what it features?  Cleaning, working out and washing clothes.  They continue to tell us how close to the end of the pregnancy she is... but they have been saying that since week 16.  The weekly vlog is all about the new to them Kia Telluride they have purchased.  Lydia is excited that it seats 7 bc she wants more kids and Trace just keeps talking about all of the research they did and how it wasn‚Äôt Lydia‚Äôs dream car, but it will suit their needs.  They have an upcoming trip to Florida with friends, and Lydia plans to take Ryker away on a final trip just the 2 of them.  Soooo... how close to coming is this baby again?? On Easter Sunday Trace poses with Addee, Ellie and Warden at Gil‚Äôs church and with Ryker and Lydia.  They are all in pink, you know, for the almost here baby girl.




8. Erin Paine is back at it selling her God cards.  She posts reviews from the 8 people who have purchased a set, and if you would like to scare your kids before bed with tales of Revelations and sin and hell and righteousness... you should purchase a set too.  Erin reposts Michael‚Äôs story about her amazing beef fat and says she simply can‚Äôt keep it in stock.  Plenty of God cards though... plenty of those.  The Lord of the Manor, Master Chadwick Paine-ful turned 38 this week.  Erin lavishes him with compliments and calls him hands down, without a doubt THE greatest man she has ever known.  She talks about how he cooks and cleans and rocks babies.... but not about that 9 to 5 we know he doesn‚Äôt hold down.  Kell Jo lays it on thick celebrating Chad... she uses a Thesaurus worth of adjectives to describe him... everything except ‚Äúprovider‚Äù.  Dude is 38.  I mean... 38.   A bakery sends Erin some free goodies and she promotes them saying they sent them on the perfect day... she was able to grift a birthday baked good is what she is saying.  Someone who has connections in Gil‚Äôs church said this week that the rumor is that Erin, Chad and the little ovary that could are pregnant with baby number 7.  That may be true bc on Easter Sunday she is seated with Finny covering her lap.  The girls are all in matching frocks and Erin tags and thanks super fan Tikky.  What would the girls do without her?




9.  Lawson and Tiffy are now full time making cheesy reels featuring smart husbands and dumb wives.  I mean they make dozens of them.  The latest features Lawson apologizing after a fight and Tiffy grabbing his supposedly poisoned drink.  Who is laughing at this stuff?  I would almost rather hear the man sing... ALMOST. Lawson has also started preaching from behind the steering wheel. He preaches about loving your neighbor and how you should show Christ‚Äôs love to those around you.  Do you think that is what he was attempting to do on January 6th at the ellipse??  Anyway, he also preaches on Easter Sunday about how Christ is real and can‚Äôt be denied.  The clan spent some time at the farm with Janie and Bill and met up with some fans at the Travelers Rest WalMart. Callie is with them at the farm and Tiffy films herself cooking breakfast there.  Back in the world of stupid reels, Lawson holds a trash can and sucks out of a large straw stuck in the can to make fun of women and their Stanley cups.  What a knee slapper. Tiffy uses a Kardashians voice over about the 6 year age difference between the 2 of them and tells commenters that she married up both metaphorically and literally. Girl... stop. Tiffy films a ton of cow content while at the farm and gets Callie to take a photo of her 9 months after giving birth.  She posts it versus what she looked like at 9 months pregnant.  In another moment of WTF... Lawson spins baby Will around and around and around while filming him from a tripod and with his phone in his mouth.  He grunts through the entire thing and it‚Äôs very uncomfortable to watch.  Baby Will is truly a prop for these 2. Tiffy‚Äôs dad is in town and he gets to carry Will around on his back.  Wonder if he‚Äôs planning a run for it?  Baby Will may be planning his own great escape, bc he is finally on the move... both scooting across the floor and cruising on the furniture. Tiffy gives us her yearly reminder that she starred in the movie ‚ÄúHOP‚Äù, and this year show‚Äôs Will watching the movie.  She says she sings terribly.  She needs a damn dictionary.  They have Easter lunch at the big house where Tiffany is in a sundress and huge white boots.  She snaps a picture with the other child star, Layla.  Lawson got invited to a Tennessee baseball game to sing the National Anthem, and he tags ESPN.... maybe for their bloopers reel?  Ellie attends the game with Tiffany, but we don‚Äôt see any other Bates there. In her grid post for April Tiff shares a picture of baby Will in a California T-shirt and features a picture of Lawson shirtless in his tight jeans...a misogynistic shirtless preacher with a HeeHaw sense of humor... just what we needed.




10. Bits and Bytes....BSB is selling separates now.  Shirts are priced at $45-60.  Here‚Äôs a hint... Belk Department Store. Clearance rack....Kelly Jo reposts Carlin‚Äôs post showing Zade in bed with the life-size Mickey Mouse she gifted him....Carlin and Whit host their very own scam giveaway for the boutique‚Äôs birthday.  Just like, share, comment, post and follow and you may win a $1000 store credit.  Carlin is learning her influencing rules well....People are commenting like crazy begging for their ‚ÄúMommy and Me‚Äù dresses, so they are sure to be a hit....the boutique turns 6 years old and now has 6 employees.... BSB is selling a $48 T-Shirt... they film a pass the phone challenge where they call Carlin the ‚Äúfounder‚Äù and she, in turn, calls Whitney her ‚Äúpartner in crime‚Äù(is that crime money laundering)...Comments on the birthday post say the boutique is so expensive, and a few mention Erin and say she should deserves credit for being there at the start...Kelly Jo shares a reel about the gun dude coming to their church, she shows Lawson, Zach, Tiffany and the baby all there... Zach cooks with the gun dude at the big house...After Easter, Kelly shares a sermon about how she should be using her life now to serve Christ.  She features Bobby singing at Bible Baptist with 2 women.


Have a great week friends!  It seems several of the Bates will be at the beach soon... I hope they know that the beach is very friendly... you can tell bc it waves!

1k4sjt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BringingUpBates/comments/1k4sjt0/breaking_down_bates/,Breaking Down Bates,"1. The Stew Crew is teasing another big trip.  After Dubai and a Disney cruise... it must be Hawaii.  No matter where they are, Layla and Zade are expected to work.  They are busy pushing the new God cartoon app and are getting good at pretending to like it.  Layla has to slum it at the boutique this week with her mom, Aunt Whitney and cousin Khloe.  She models for the new Mommy and Me line the Boutique is launching and you can almost hear Alyssa‚Äôs screams slam from Orlando.  Layla really plays up to the camera, while Khloe is more reserved and smiles sheepishly.  All of the boutique employees cheer Layla on, and that‚Äôs all of the payment she requires at this young age.  Carlin is hell bent on the world knowing she‚Äôs exercising and shows off her Pilates gear day after day.  At her monthly baby appointment, she films the heartbeat at 147 and asks what everyone‚Äôs guess is for gender...then has brunch with Evan the thumb who she calls ‚Äúhandsome‚Äù.  Back at the home studio, Layla has just about perfected her lines for the bi-monthly ‚Äúdaddy‚Äôs little princess‚Äù reel.  We see Carlin getting her all dressed for ballet pictures, and Layla is excited for her full face of makeup.  Layla twirls, sings and plays for the camera while Evan and his smarmy grin look on.  Dude is laughing all the way to the bank.  The reel has almost 500 comments and has been shared over 7,000 times just on instagram. You have to wonder if Layla will be embarrassed as she grows up and has people feel like they know her... know everything about her... come up to her and ask her personal things?  The comments are as creepy as ever with people saying they ‚Äúwant her‚Äù, ‚Äúshe has my heart‚Äù, someone even goes off about how she is being raised to be Biblically feminine and how the desire to be delighted in starts so young. Creepy as hell... and SO many people ‚Äúcrying‚Äù. 55,000 likes for one very exploited child.  Later we see Layla at the dance studio posing for her pictures while Zade sits and watches.  The Stew Crew vlogs have been leveling out over on YouTube.  They are averaging right around 100,000 views per week, so Carlin promotes all of the old vlogs while showing both kids sitting on Evan‚Äôs lap as he edits. Carlin says they are working with him, but they are both glued to the ipad that is set up beside his laptop.  The weekly vlog is a mashup of events from the last several weeks that they have already shown... trips to the dentist, Evan‚Äôs play practice, Layla at dance.  Zade is still getting subtitles, and Carlin says at the end of his 4 week swimming lesson, he should be swimming without a floatie.  Does that mean he won‚Äôt get more than 4 weeks?  They continue to talk about their upcoming trip and the long plane ride they have to make to get there.  Evan talks again about working with the Youth at his church.  We see more of Carlin‚Äôs birthday, including Warden walking in and going right to their fridge as if he lives there... and maybe he does.  Carlin films herself wallowing around on the floor of her bedroom to link water jugs and phone cases.  She gives a close up of her unbuttoned jeans while showing off her baby bump and says they will take viewers along on their upcoming bucket list trip.  The kids get their Easter baskets early and pick up eggs Evan tossed all over their astro turf.  They seem to have brand new pool furniture and Layla has a new bob haircut.  The Stewarts attend their church‚Äôs Sunrise Service and Carlin gets plenty of shots of Layla kissing her belly while they are in matching outfits.  From the upcoming line at BSB... of course!





2.  Baby Harvey Clark is 6.5 months old now, and Katie says she is soaking up all of the baby love before he grows up.  The kid is the oldest baby ever.  Once again the Clarks are out at a store late at night with 2 sleepy kids... this time to buy Easter supplies.  Back at home, Katie shows off her disgusting high chair cover to sell stain treatment.  A blow out obviously happened on the cover, but nothing is too low for these fools to show for a dollar.  Hailey is becoming an expert level giggler, and Katie catches almost all of them on film.  The weekly vlog shows Erin driving the Clarks to the airport after their cruise.  We even see Katie and Erin hug, so that feud is obviously over.  Back at the new mcmansion, a solid white couch has been delivered and Katie is beaming.  Remi the dog is climbing all over the stark white behemoth, but no worries bc Katie says it‚Äôs a great fabric that resists stains.  Nothing screams ‚Äúwe have tons of disposable income‚Äù like buying a white piece of furniture when you have 2 toddlers and a big ole dog.  Speaking of Remi, Warden is now the dog sitter when the family is away... sounds like he really is couch surfing.  Hailey has to show up and sell the dog food that is sponsoring this yawnfest, and then she has to star in the feature presentation... a day at the zoo.  Katie and Travis haven‚Äôt even unpacked from the cruise, but content doesn‚Äôt stop, so it‚Äôs off to the Knoxville Zoo where Hailey screams, claps and giggles and Katie carries the baby around in her overalls.  They only take one stroller, so Hailey doesn‚Äôt have a choice but to walk around performing.  Travis says there was a ton of packages waiting for them when they got back home, and after that humble brag, we learn that he took off to South Carolina alone to meet up with his family and record some new music.  He tells us they will spend the weekend working at the big house on a project Gil is undertaking and Katie talks about how much she adores the fact that Travis is able to help her family.  They show their trip to Target again, where Katie says she never got an Easter basket, and never dyed eggs.  Travis‚Äô mom had to guide her through it.  Travis wants everyone to stream some cover of a song he is singing with another gospel group.  Their vlogs, just like the Stew Crew, are only averaging about 100,000 views per week.  On Easter Sunday Katie matches with Hailey and Harvey matches Travis. We see Hailey with her brand new King James Version, monogrammed Bible... just what every toddler needs.




3.  Josie Balka continues to fine tune her influencing.  Her latest trick is to use a thumbnail of her children at the beginning of a mini vlog that has absolutely nothing to do with her kids to draw in the views.  This is a telltale sign that she knows what sells.  The mini vlog is just another GRWM for church where she‚Äôs in a breakneck hurry but still ends up looking like a glamazon at the end.  Josie spends pretty much every day selling makeup and drinking coffee... we haven‚Äôt even seen Kelton in the kitchen lately.  She films the same things over and over and over... including another morning routine vlog.  People ask about washing her hair after a workout, about wearing the pool noodle constantly, and if she can please film a morning routine with the girls.  She‚Äôs back to hawking the travel bag she took on the cruise and while showing it off, we see that the Balkas flew Comfort Plus... a step up from economy.  She keeps rerunning the same old ad for the grocery delivery service, and has a new link to push... H&M.  The Balka girls attend the new cult church‚Äôs Easter Egg hunt, and then spend some time with Kelton‚Äôs dad.  On Easter Sunday the family poses outside of the church dressed in their beigiest beige and the big news is that Josie finally got a hold of Kelton‚Äôs beaver tail eyebrows and waxed those suckers within an inch of his life.  Also, she has discovered the Kim K. clear heels circa 2010 just like Carlin.  Speaking of Carlin, Josie snaps a picture of her girls with cousin Layla.  Hazel is the same height as Layla now.  Later, the girls have the most depressing egg hunt ever featuring white plastic eggs.  They are wearing all white and seem to be out at their new property.  Josie still hasn‚Äôt revealed if the new dream home is under construction yet.

The latest features Lawson apologizing after a fight and Tiffy grabbing his supposedly poisoned drink.  Who is laughing at this stuff?  I would almost rather hear the man sing... ALMOST. Lawson has also started preaching from behind the steering wheel. He preaches about loving your neighbor and how you should show Christ‚Äôs love to those around you.  Do you think that is what he was attempting to do on January 6th at the ellipse??  Anyway, he also preaches on Easter Sunday about how Christ is real and can‚Äôt be denied.  The clan spent some time at the farm with Janie and Bill and met up with some fans at the Travelers Rest WalMart. Callie is with them at the farm and Tiffy films herself cooking breakfast there.  Back in the world of stupid reels, Lawson holds a trash can and sucks out of a large straw stuck in the can to make fun of women and their Stanley cups.  What a knee slapper. Tiffy uses a Kardashians voice over about the 6 year age difference between the 2 of them and tells commenters that she married up both metaphorically and literally. Girl... stop. Tiffy films a ton of cow content while at the farm and gets Callie to take a photo of her 9 months after giving birth.  She posts it versus what she looked like at 9 months pregnant.  In another moment of WTF... Lawson spins baby Will around and around and around while filming him from a tripod and with his phone in his mouth.  He grunts through the entire thing and it‚Äôs very uncomfortable to watch.  Baby Will is truly a prop for these 2. Tiffy‚Äôs dad is in town and he gets to carry Will around on his back.  Wonder if he‚Äôs planning a run for it?  Baby Will may be planning his own great escape, bc he is finally on the move... both scooting across the floor and cruising on the furniture. Tiffy gives us her yearly reminder that she starred in the movie ‚ÄúHOP‚Äù, and this year shows Will watching the movie.  She says she sings terribly.  She needs a damn dictionary.  They have Easter lunch at the big house where Tiffany is in a sundress and huge white boots.  She snaps a picture with the other child star, Layla.  Lawson got invited to a Tennessee baseball game to sing the National Anthem, and he tags ESPN.... maybe for their bloopers reel?  Ellie attends the game with Tiffany, but we don‚Äôt see any other Bates there. In her grid post for April Tiff shares a picture of baby Will in a California T-shirt and features a picture of Lawson shirtless in his tight jeans...a misogynistic singing shirtless preacher with a HeeHaw sense of humor... just what we needed.

Zach cooks with the gun dude at the big house...After Easter, Kelly shares a sermon about how she should be using her life now to serve Christ.  She features Bobby singing at Bible Baptist with 2 women.

A Very Sweet and involved, man. He‚Äôs becoming increasingly more involved in our parish life. And including the troops as well. It‚Äôs been going great. 
About 2 1/2 months ago, he disclosed to me, tearfully, as I checked in with him one evening, that his wife left him pretty abruptly. And he‚Äôs pretty shaken up about it. We‚Äôve met for coffee twice. Both times were equally pastoral care and equally planning how the scouts could be involved in ministries of the church. 
I then suggested because he is increasingly involved in our community and he is going through a rough time‚Äîthat he tryout Sunday morning church not just helping around the building, involving himself and the troops in some of our outage, activities etc. 
I suggested that he try to come during Lent and that we would catch up after Easter. 
He initiated a conversation last week saying let‚Äôs set up a coffee this week .
That coffee meeting is tomorrow morning !! 

Question: 
I am the priest and he is a faithful man who no longer connected to the RCC- and going through a really rough time. 
What questions would YOU want to be asked if you were him? 
What point would you want your priest to touch on?

My mom's common criticisms:

\- The movie is too unrealistic. She does not like sci-fi or paranormal stuff. The story has to be grounded in reality. No extreme body horror or intense special effects. So, no ghosts, zombies, vampires, aliens, etc. 

\- The characters are dumb and goofy. She does not like comedy where people act like cartoon characters or are extremely dumb. She does not enjoy parodies, physical comedy, or satire. 

\- The plot is too convenient. Things magically resolve themselves or there's always a solution for every problem. 

My dad's common criticisms:

\- Nothing happens. He HATES slow-burn movies. He needs things to happen immediately or else he's not interested. Not necessarily action movies, but things have to be happening, the story has to keep moving. 

\- It's too dialogue heavy or they don't talk at all. He does not like it when scenes consist entirely of conversations or scenes where characters do not talk at all and it's more atmospheric. 

\- Artsy cinematography. Movies like The Nickel Boys for example, that have unusual POVs. He does not like dream sequences. 

\- Body horror, gore, extreme violence. He hates movies like Saw, Final Destination, Hostel, The Grudge, The Ring, etc. 

Some of the movies they like:

\- Apocalypto

\- Brokeback Mountain

\- Pretty Woman

\- The Irishman

\- The Coffee Table

\- Creep

\- Heretic

\- The Northman

\- Big Eyes

Some of the movies they hate:

\- When Evil Lurks

\- The Grudge

\- Long Legs

\- Nosferatu

\- Speak No Evil

\- REC

\- Hereditary

\- Evil Dead",13,1745279827.0,MovieRecommendations,43,1.0,False

She‚Äôs talked to her mother about it ‚Äî about how she feels like she‚Äôs waking up from being watched. But her mother always says the same thing every time:

‚ÄúHoney, you‚Äôre being paranoid. You live in an apartment building, for god‚Äôs sake. There‚Äôs cameras in every hallway. The building manager‚Ä¶ Phil? I can‚Äôt remember his name, but he‚Äôd tell you if someone was coming into your apartment or something. Just read a book before bed, take some melatonin ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know, sweetie.‚Äù

Then it‚Äôs back to gossip from her coffee club or something equally unhelpful. But Bridgett‚Äôs desperate, so tonight she‚Äôll try a book and melatonin. She doubts it‚Äôll work, but she‚Äôll try anything.

She fell asleep with the bedside lamp on‚Ä¶

A feeling of dread pours over her. She calmly reaches over and turns on the lamp, as calmly as she can. She looks around her bedroom before pulling off the blankets and standing up. She grabs her phone and turns on the flashlight.

She walks to the hallway of her apartment ‚Äî it leads from her bedroom straight to her kitchen. It‚Äôs pitch black and her heart is racing.

She turns the hallway light on. Nothing.

She stares at the blackness of her kitchen ‚Äî it terrifies her. She decides to save it for last.

I‚Äôm a special education teacher teaching in an ICT classroom in elementary school. There have been a couple families that have done this but one particularly that has done this multiple times where they are gifting my coteacher things and not acknowledging me. I don‚Äôt know how to phrase this without possibly sounding selfish but it‚Äôs not the material things that I care about. It‚Äôs the acknowledgement that my coteacher receives but I have not. When there is an issue with the student and other students both of us are involved in contacting families and solving whatever the issue is. When this specific family emails us about something we are both addressed in the email and there is no distinction in who is the Gen Ed and who is the sped teacher. However, this family has sent little gifts/treats with notes multiple times to my coteacher. Today, this parent was talking to my coteacher on the phone. She had sent another gift in and when my co was thanking her for the gift on the phone, the parent said she wanted to give my co some coffee but she didn‚Äôt know how she took it. My co told her what she liked and the mom said she‚Äôd send in some coffee. I was not mentioned.

Again, this isn‚Äôt about being gifted anything so I‚Äôm not trying to sound selfish. But teaching is a very difficult job so when a parent goes out of their way to say thank you, it‚Äôs always appreciated. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so hard for me in this situation. Just wondering if other teachers out there have experienced something similar and how they dealt with it.

Also, discussing this with my co would not help. We are not a good match and have different working styles. We have had multiple discussions about this and both have accepted we are not a good fit. She likes to be in control and I have often been treated like an assistant. Being that she is closely related to admin doesn‚Äôt help so I have to tread carefully when having discussions with her about specific concerns.

Since I'm feeling thorough today I will be breaking down the anatomy of a ""Do-nothing"" session again (how to do it and why it works), how I reprogram my subconscious, and how to integrate Do-less living into your daily lives. Here is my first post about it: [**HERE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1jxju1b/doless_living_i_manifest_everything_by_doing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) *and a second more popular post >>>* [**HERE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1k1ckvm/my_rapid_manifesting_hack_that_most_are_too/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

As a reiteration, I only share my personal experiences and what works for me. If it doesn't work for you, try something else or ask questions about how you can tweak it maybe someone else will have an answer, **do not** use this as a venting or complaining space.

**Why ""Do-nothing"" sessions work (for me)**

In my opinion I think the world is addicted to effort. In a world like that, silence and stillness are very disruptive. Doing, trying, and ""efforting"" can *sometimes* create resistance to manifestation, **stillness creates space for manifestation**. Stillness exposes the noise and interrupts the program that you've been running unconsciously everyday. When you do nothing, you‚Äôre no longer running from your old self-concept or trying to forcibly install your new self-concept. You‚Äôre giving your subconscious permission to breathe, reset, and receive new instruction instead of giving it automated instructions that are based in fear, lack, scarcity, and ignorance of identity. *So here's why it changed MY life personally*:

1. **Techniques feel like effort**: Using techniques can sometimes translate as ""I don't have my desire yet, so I must *do* something in order to *have*"". Taking the effort out of manifestation and focusing on inspired action instead will ensure you're in alignment with your new self-concept and not acting out of *fear*, but instead acting out of *inspiration*.
2. **Removes the life source of limiting beliefs**\*: Thoughts need attention and engagement\* in order to survive and manifest into the physical realm. If you take your focus away, the thought dies. During these meditative sessions, the beliefs that are aligned with your old self-concept *filters themselves out into the ""trash""* due to lack of attention, reaction, and engagement.
3. **Creates empty space for new self-concept**: What's leftover after your session is now empty space for  new thoughts, desires, self-concept, or programming you'd like. Fill it up with all your new self-concept thoughts and traits.
4. **Heals the brain**: These sessions have helped me regain my memory recall, feel less irritability, experience less undesired thoughts, get better sleep, less spiraling, less reactivity and impulsive behavior, strengthen my identity as the observer, and receive clearer, less vague thoughts and answers to questions I have.

**What's a ""Do-nothing"" session?**

I coined the concept of the ""Do-nothing"" session not too long ago (April 12th 2025 to be exact). It‚Äôs exactly what it sounds like. No technique. No force. Just being. Remember, you‚Äôre not ‚Äúdoing‚Äù manifestation. You‚Äôre clearing space so the real you can rise to the surface. Idc if you call it meditation, literally whatever. Just do it.

There are two main styles of the ""Do-nothing"" session: *Eyes Open and Eyes Closed*

1. **Eyes Opened**
   * Get still: Lay or sit down. Pick a neutral focal point like a blank wall, a ceiling, tree, or a patch of sky.
   * During Session: Don‚Äôt label. Don‚Äôt react. Don‚Äôt engage. Let every thought come and go like clouds. You‚Äôre not here to think, you‚Äôre here to ""empty"". By not engaging with the thoughts, this clears the mental clutter, creates empty space, resets your field, and allows for new thoughts to be ushered in.
   * My Perspective: Keeping my eyes open w/ a central focus like the ceiling is less stimulating, so I am less likely to ""try"" to form a thought or an image.
2. **Eyes Closed**
   * Get Still: Lay or sit down, and gently close your eyes.
   * During Session: Same instructions. No creating thoughts or images. No labeling. No reacting. Let it all pass.
   * My Perspective: It‚Äôs more relaxing but I‚Äôm more likely to fall asleep. Also, my imagination turns all the way up (more images, more thoughts). That‚Äôs not a bad thing but sometimes I just want stillness, so I save this for when I‚Äôm feeling dreamy or saturating.

Also you may be thinking, but isn't there a type of meditation like this that already exists? No. There are practices that superficially resemble a do-nothing session, but none fully capture my approach.

This is different because it is **manifestation-focused**, there‚Äôs no spiritual or religious context needed (just knowing you are Consciousness), you aren't just ""clearing your mind"", you‚Äôre making space for a new self-concept to naturally integrate and express, and there's no strictness or rigidity.

**What will fill the empty space after my thoughts discard themselves?:**

I say whatever you desire, but really it's whatever you assume. To assume your identity as Consciousness/God-expressed, you must trust yourself. You must trust that the subconscious mind is HIGHLY intelligent and knows what to fill it up with. You must trust that when you remove your attention and emotions from your undesired thoughts, that what is most aligned with you and your fulfillment will arrive swiftly in its place.

*IMPORTANT*: After my sessions I only behave and think like the person who has my desires, so that's literally what flows into my reality automatically. Even if I feel triggered or accidentally react to the 3D, I shift right back because I didn't persist in it, it was a temporary state that wasn't sustained, so it won't manifest.

Now if you are new to this and you don't trust yourself just yet, *have a saturation session* right before you meditate into your do-nothing session so that you imprint your subconscious mind beforehand.

**What's a saturation session?**

It's where you expose your attention or focus on something briefly or for an extended period of time to imprint your subconscious. Vision boards, affirmations, scripting etc. Whether it is an image, a thought, a journal entry, or a feeling: **submerge your mind in it like a hot tub**.  (*and no it doesn't matter how long you saturate so please don't ask, you're God, act like it and make a sound decision without asking how to decide for once*).

**How to RE-program your self-concept:**

1. **Sustained focus aka saturation**: there are two types (More [**HERE** ](https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1k1wd80/the_only_time_i_saturate_when_i_indulge/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)on when and how I saturate.)
   * Direct Saturation: Mirror work, robotic affirming, scripting. I usually saturate once when the desire first comes. Just enough to imprint. Then I let it go unless I‚Äôm inspired again. I don‚Äôt force repetition.
   * Indirect Saturation: Vision boards, subliminals, pinterest saves, film/tv, music. You‚Äôre not obsessing you‚Äôre just letting your environment feed your identity passively. You'll most likely walk past the vision board daily. Glance at the your phone wallpaper constantly. No pressure. Just vibes.
2. **Surrender + blind faith**
   * Here you shift into the mindset of ""*whether I receive it or not I am still fulfilled, I could have nothing and know that I have everything I need*"", and you think about it from a state of gratitude and knowing because the fact that you desired it means it already exists, you're simply aligning with it by creating space for it by letting the resistance go during your do-nothing sessions

*So, as a Master Manifestor, your daily life will look similar to this pattern:*

* Finally accepts that ""I AM Consciousness/God incarnated into a human body""
* Receives a new desire and claims it
* Saturates and Imprints it onto my mind (if inspired ONLY, do **not** force)
* Has a do-nothing session
* Goes out into the world and lives life
* Has a do-nothing session
* Goes out into the world and lives life
* **Receives desire**
* Goes out into the world and lives life
* Has a do-nothing session (*receives a new lesson or download this time*)
* Goes out into the world and lives life (*applies lessons and downloads to real life this time*)
* **Receives another desire aligned with most updated self-concept**
* Goes out into the world and lives life
* Has a do-nothing session (*because you've mastered it , it feeds you, and it's a habit now*)
* .....you get this gist?

**How to integrate Do-less living into your daily life?**

This is where the God-state really kicks in. The do-less life doesn‚Äôt mean you sit still and *never* move. It means you stop moving from fear. You stop acting from doubt. You stop chasing what‚Äôs already yours.

1. **Inspired action**: it feels like an internal nudge or natural action that you don't realize happened until after it's done. It's like you're walking down the street and today you turn left instead of right, you don't know why, you just did. It's like that feeling the night before christmas or the first day of school. It's a low rumbling, ""I want to do this"" ""I should try this"" or ""I wonder what this would be like?"". It doesn't take hard and exhausting thought. *Inspired action* is always going to come from a place of: calmness, acceptance, certainty, and allowance. *Forced action* comes from: lack, fear, impulsivity, and avoidance. The action you take from stillness is infinitely more powerful than action taken from panic.
2. **Trigger release**: Humans have a privilege that not many other species have. We have the complexity of emotions and senses. Although some may disagree, this is a privilege. We **get to** experience the full spectrum of emotions. Which means sometimes we may be triggered by the 3D although we are God-expressed. Whenever you are triggered or emotionally impacted by the 3D or your own spiraling thoughts, create a *trigger release phrase* that shifts you back into the God-state as fast as possible. Mine is *""There is nothing to resist""* because it reminds me that I am ALL that is, if there is resistance it is because I am giving up my power to the 3D and sustaining focus on something that I don't want.
3. **F\*ck the how**: Literally please STOP trying to find out how your desire will manifest. When I tell you that the possibilities and ways that your desire can manifest are INFINITE, that's what I mean, literally not figuratively. If you sat there trying to analyze every single way that your desire could materialize you'd be there FOREVER and MISS OUT on the actual arrival and experience of the desire. Also, trying to figure out ""how"", basically affirms that you **don't** have it. When you are open to the ""easiest"" way, then that will come easily, but if you only restrict it to one way, you WILL have to wait until that specific way is available in the grand scheme of things. (For example: you could get your SP in many ways, but you think the only way is if you reach out to them first. So now you're in a perpetual state of 'when should i reach out?' 'what should i say?')
4. **Protect your peace**: Seriously. You need to be protecting your peace like it is the source of your manifestations. (Because it kinda is) The quieter your mind, the louder your manifestations. Do-nothing sessions are not ""breaks"" from manifesting (you're always manifesting). They‚Äôre the portal through which everything flows in. Keep your nervous system regulated. Take breaks from content. Don‚Äôt argue with people who live in resistance. Stay anchored in the knowing. A do-less life isn‚Äôt passive. Someone who is living a do-less life doesn't need to prove anything to anyone and don't fear being misunderstood. It‚Äôs precise and powerful. It‚Äôs what happens when you no longer act from fear because you already know it‚Äôs yours.
5. **ACTUALLY LIVE YOUR LIFE**: Stop hovering in the state of ""waiting"" for something to manifest. In between your desire and its arrival, you should be having fun, living life, learning new things, applying the lessons learned, trying new hobbies, cultivating relationships, going outside and touching some grass, going into the world and just being a human, enjoy this big world, stop moping and being weird. You're God. Go be God, but in your own unique font, in your own style, in your own way.

1k4s4i2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToBeHero_X/comments/1k4s4i2/theory_of_the_power_of_x_by_me/,Theory of The power of X. (By Me),"I WORK A LOT OF HOURS and have searched for all possible official information there is to date and reviewed all available content. The last thing I saw and that may be important to me is that in the opening the keyword INERTIA is mentioned three times and X is shown in the background and the animation style changes 3 times as well (which I think is a kind of reality change) meaning he used his power. this made me investigate, ive been days seeing everything and together with an artificial intelligence I came up with this:

# 1. Manifestation of Power and Visual Transformations

Every time X snaps his fingers, an extraordinary visual transformation is unleashed that redefines the aesthetics of the universe. It is important to note that in the opening sequence, a particular order of these transitions is observed; however, outside of that context, there is no fixed sequence‚Äîthe transformation can occur in various forms depending on the narrative context.

* **In the Opening (Specific Sequence):**
   * **First Snap:** The environment adopts a semi-3D or CGI aesthetic, establishing a familiar visual base that introduces the viewer to the hero‚Äôs universe.
   * **Second Snap:** The animation transforms into a dynamic anime 2D style, taking the narrative into a more expressive and emotional realm that accentuates the feelings and intensity of the moment.
   * **Third Snap:** The universe settles into a 3D hyperrealism, akin to a statue frozen in a single plane, where every detail becomes monumental and reinforces X‚Äôs enigmatic character.
* **Outside the Opening:** The visual transformation does not follow a predetermined order; it can vary according to the needs of each scene. For example, during combat or narrative sequences, the animation may shift from one style to another unpredictably, emphasizing both the instability and the uniqueness of X‚Äôs power in each situation.
* **Clear Examples in Scenarios:**
   * In one combat scene, just before a car is about to crash, X snaps his fingers and the vehicle is instantly transformed into a handkerchief, showcasing his ability to alter reality in a surprising manner.
   * During another confrontation, as he merges with a wall, his enemies are transformed into graffiti that appears to be part of the urban landscape, while an infinity symbol is projected on the ground behind X and a smaller one is positioned atop his head, suggesting an absolute dominance over the visual narrative.
   * In inverted orientation scenarios, a falling platform transforms into an ocean, with X appearing upside down, inverting gravity and creating a scenario where conventional rules no longer apply.

# 2. Examples in Combat and Iconic Moments

X‚Äôs combat sequences are filled with examples that clearly demonstrate the scope and creativity of his power:

* **Sequences of Total Transformation:**
   * X merges into a wall alongside his opponents, and within seconds, the environment fragments into geometric figures reminiscent of a comic or anime. His enemies become mere strokes and urban art, showing how his actions reconfigure space without leaving any trace of what was there before.
   * In a rapid fight, a villain who leaps toward X is repelled with a snap that transforms him, leaving the adversary permanently stuck to the wall in the form of graffiti.
* **Connection with the Soundtrack:** A song accompanied by the phrase ‚ÄúBending Space and Time‚Äù reinforces the concept that his power not only alters the aesthetics of the environment but also challenges the conventional limits of time and space, imbuing each encounter with a unique and almost mythical atmosphere.

# 3. Duality: The Ordinary Man Versus the Enigmatic Hero

X‚Äôs character is enriched by the marked duality between his everyday life and his heroic persona:

* **Everyday Life:** In his real form, X is just an ordinary worker. He is seen following an established routine: arriving and leaving at the appointed times, stealing sugar from the coffee machine, and even protesting against overtime by stating, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick of working overtime until midnight. This doesn‚Äôt concern you at all.‚Äù This aspect underlines that despite his formidable power, his daily life remains grounded and human.
* **The Transformation into ‚ÄúHero X‚Äù:** When he transforms, his appearance changes radically: his suit shifts from black to white, his hair becomes white instead of black, and the details of his attire become more refined (for example, his glasses evolve from round and dark to square and stylish). This duality emphasizes that behind the mundane routine lies an enigmatic hero who operates independently, free from the traditional formulas imposed by corporate or media narratives.

# 4. The Structure of Heroic Power and the Competition of Beliefs

In X‚Äôs universe, collective faith is the driving force behind the heroes, although its exact relationship with X‚Äôs power remains a mystery:

* **The Competition of Beliefs:** While other heroes depend on a corporate structure and publicity campaigns to bolster their status, X has maintained his position at the top for several years thanks to a power that seems to detach itself from this scheme. Even though his connection to the number of ""believers"" is a recurrent theme, in X‚Äôs case the link between public faith and his ability remains ambiguous and enigmatic.
* **The Heroes‚Äô Tournament:** There is mention of a tournament in which heroes compete for the title of ‚ÄúHero X.‚Äù Although the exact frequency of this tournament is not specified, it is clear that X has been number one for years. The slogans‚Äîwhich refer to ‚Äúthe one who gathers the most belief‚Äù as the foundation of power‚Äîposition X in an indisputable authority, despite the uncertainty regarding the precise mechanism of his ability.

# 5. Conclusion

X‚Äôs power is manifested through simple finger snaps that trigger striking visual and narrative transformations. In the opening sequence, a specific order of changes‚Äîfrom CGI to anime 2D and then to 3D hyperrealism‚Äîsets the atmosphere of the universe; outside of that context, the transitions can vary, reinforcing the unstable and enigmatic nature of his ability.

Examples from combat, such as transforming a car into a handkerchief, integrating enemies into walls as graffiti, or inverting gravity so that platforms become seas, demonstrate that his power rewrites reality in unexpected and artistic ways.

The soundtrack, with phrases like ‚ÄúBending Space and Time,‚Äù accentuates the magnitude of his abilities, while the duality between his everyday life and his identity as ‚ÄúHero X‚Äù highlights a profound contrast between humanity and myth. Finally, although the connection between collective faith and his power remains partially shrouded in mystery, the impact of X is undeniable‚Äîestablishing him as the number one hero, independent and enigmatic.

Any contribution is appreciated. I also hope that you appreciate my hard work and that it may be useful for those who are interested. One extra detail: several times in the series‚Äîeven in scenes with X‚Äîthe word 'REAL' is mentioned, as in 'Real Hero.' The teaser for Chapter 4 ends with Ling Ling saying, 'I never wanted to be nice, I wanted to be a REAL HERO,' which is echoed in the battle/song of X‚ÄîI wanted to include that.

I'm looking for new online friends or just general casual conversation to pass the time. it's a fairly laid-back evening here here and I don't have any major plans, so I thought I'd see if anyone feels like passing the time talking about life, hobbies, passions, nonsense, etc.

about me: I'm 28 and from the eastern united states. I'm a huge nerd for animals and nature, and I love learning about entomology, paleontology, and marine biology. I enjoy gaming and have over 4k hours in one of my favorite video games. I also like crafting and make my own stuffed animals by hand. I enjoy hanging out in quiet cafes, visiting museums, and regularly going to my local aquarium to see my favorite penguin. I collect stickers, trinkets, decorative birds, and sanrio merch. I love hello kitty, iced coffee, disco music, vintage tech, and video essays on theme park history. overall I'd say I'm pretty easygoing and straightforward. I love unironic enthusiasm about the little things in life.

if you think we'd get along and you want to chat, feel free to send me a message and introduce yourself.

1k4rzi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k4rzi6/my_husband_started_sleepwalking/,My Husband Started Sleepwalking,"Gus yawned for the ninth time that morning.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre watching me again,‚Äù he said, without looking up from his coffee. He‚Äôd switched from his usual latte sachets to espresso.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just worried,‚Äù I replied.

It had been two months since we relocated to Montana. I hadn‚Äôt found a new job‚ÄîGus‚Äôs salary as a litigator covered us both‚Äîand between Zoom interviews, I‚Äôd unpacked nearly the entire house myself. Gus had hardly been getting enough sleep. He‚Äôd always been the one to correct my pronunciation, but now he barely noticed my mistakes.

He shrugged. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably insomnia from the move. Plus, work‚Äôs been running me ragged. They‚Äôre my new bosses, and I want to make a good impression. A little less sleep now is no big deal.‚Äù 

But it wasn‚Äôt just the lack of sleep that worried me‚Äîit was what was causing it. Mornings, when we cuddled until he had to leave, he smelled of sweat and cigarettes. I‚Äôd traced two pale crescents on his neck‚Äîbite marks‚Äîand half‚Äëremembered dreaming of reaching out to an empty space beside me.

One morning I said, ‚ÄúYou were gone for a while last night,‚Äù hoping a casual tone would make him slip up.

He looked at me, confused, and continued getting dressed. I‚Äôd been cheated on before‚Äîtwice, actually. So had Gus; it was one of the things we bonded over. He‚Äôd never given me reason to distrust him‚Äîuntil now. There was a hollowness in him, as if he were living a double life. And I had moved across the country for him. All that risk and sacrifice‚Ä¶ what if I‚Äôd been wrong?

That night, determined to confirm my suspicions, I went to bed early while he gamed on his computer. When he finally crawled in and lowered the sheet to kiss my shoulder, I laid perfectly still. No more nights of wondering if I‚Äôd uprooted my life for someone I couldn‚Äôt trust.

At 3:00‚ÄØa.m., just as I was drifting off, Gus stirred. I listened as he slipped out of bed, buttoned his shirt, zipped his pants, and laced his shoes‚Äîeach movement slow and mechanical. I gripped my pillow.

‚ÄúI cannot believe you,‚Äù I hissed and let the pillow fly.

The pillow struck his face. He didn‚Äôt blink. Eyes glazed, he stared into some dimension I couldn‚Äôt see. I waved my hand before him‚Äîhe didn‚Äôt register it. He shuffled to the front door and rifled through his pockets for his house key.

Down the street he stumbled, not on the footpath but in the middle of the road. Headlights passed on the next street over, and dread knotted in my chest. All it would take is one distracted driver‚Äînot expecting a sleepwalking man on the road‚Äî and he'd be run down. 

‚ÄúGus, wake up‚Äî‚Äù I called, but as if sensing my concern he turned off the road and entered the treeline. The moon was hidden behind clouds, its light diffused into a dull gray glow.

From what I knew, sleepwalkers usually repeated daytime routines‚Äîmaking sandwiches, turning on the TV, sometimes more intimate acts. What routine could lead Gus into the forest at night? My stomach twisted. What if this was something else?

Ahead, a soft orange glow emanated from a stone cave. Smoke drifted out. Gus stepped inside. I could hear whispering‚Ä¶ and a strange sucking sound. I crept forward. Inside, a campfire lit a wider chamber. Eight or nine naked people‚Äîmen and women, fit and fat‚Äîstood around it, shoulders slumped, heads down, moaning and swaying. The circle wasn‚Äôt sensual‚Äîit was formal. In the firelight I saw crude symbols painted in ash on each chest. They stood motionless except for a low chant.

A shadow shifted. The smoke cleared, revealing a strange man prowling behind the circle. His body was covered in thin, bristly hair‚Äîdense with tiny follicles, like a cactus or a spider. When the smoke parted, his mouth area twisted open and a funnel-like office extended out and plunged into one of the naked victims‚Äô necks.

I gasped‚Äîtoo loud‚Äîand clamped my hand over my mouth. The creature turned toward me. I scrambled back but knocked a pile of rocks loose. They tumbled down stone steps, echoing through the cave. The thing screeched. From behind, a damp cloth pressed to my mouth‚ÄîI struggled, head spinning‚Äîthen nothing. When I came to, I lay tangled in my sheets, a burning pain behind my eyelids. I recalled the events of the night and shook Gus awake, but he didn't remember any of it. I wrote everything down in case I soon struggled with the same haze.

Now, I no longer feel rested when I wake, and dark bags sit under my eyes. People comment on my yawning and offer coffee. A small red ring of tender flesh has appeared on my neck, and I‚Äôm paler than ever.

Each morning I find myself standing at the foot of the bed, hair damp with sweat, a single scratch scoring my wrist. And somehow‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs an ache in my chest that feels like belonging.",4,1745278270.0,nosleep,2,0.7,False

Episode 22: Camp Castaways

""Last time, on Total Drama Island! We made our Final Six get to know one another by handcuffing them together and making them compete in a Tri-Armed Triathlon!""

""Ezekiel and Ella spent the whole day getting to know each other, Shawn and Dawn managed to bond well despite being complete oddballs, and Heather and Cody, well, let's say that they did not warm up to each other one bit.""

""For winning both the eating contest and the Totem Pole of Shame and Humiliation, Heather and Cody earned themselves invincibility. In the end, it was Dawn who got hauled off to the Dock of Shame.""

""Who will be voted off this week in the most dramatic campfire ceremony yet? Find out tonight, on Total! Drama! Island!""

(Theme Song)

It was raining heavily as the episode opened on the Dock of Shame, and Chris stood at the end of it beneath a dark brown umbrella. ""Welcome back to Total Drama Island!"" he said with a wave. ""This week, we've prepared a bizarre episode full of surprises. For instance, take this weather! Rain is not an easy thing to control, let me tell ya! But, we figured the five remaining campers were gettin' off way too easy. So, we pulled some strings, and voila!"" The shot pulled back out just as the host was struck by a bolt of lightning and yelped.

The scene cut to the cabins, where several puddles had formed outside and three of the campers loitered on their porches.

""Listen up, campers!"" Chris announced through the loudspeaker. ""One of the most grueling challenges of any summer camp experience is the dreaded rain day, where all activities with even the remotest possibility of being fun are canceled, in favor of the Craft Tent! The forecast for tomorrow?"" he added. ""Rain, rain, and more rain,"" Shawn was looking around in disdain, ""followed by rain."" Ella, who had been relaxing quietly while surrounded by two birds, looked up at the loudspeaker. ""See you all in the Craft Tent tomorrow,"" Heather was shown painting her toenails, ""at 0700 hours!""

‚ÄúFrowning like a big suck won't bring Dawn back, you know,‚Äù Heather mocked Ella. ‚ÄúIt'll just give you premature wrinkles. Oops. Too late.‚Äù

Ella shot her a glare, and the two birds stomped on the step that they were on, messing up Heather's pedicure.

‚ÄúYou're not going to get anywhere if all you do is act mean,‚Äù Ella lectured.

‚ÄúAnd yet, she still manages to stay in the game,‚Äù Shawn rolled his eyes.

‚ÄúDon't you have a tree you should be hanging upside down on, zombie boy?‚Äù Heather raised an eyebrow.

Shawn groaned. ""Where's Zeke? I need someone to talk to.‚Äù

Confessional: Ezekiel

The static cut to Ezekiel in the outhouse as the rain could be heard outside. ""I really hate rainy days,"" he said. ""All it does is sog up the dirt around our farm, which makes it harder for us to do our chores.""

""But anyway, I've reached the Final Five eh!"" the homeschooler cheered. ‚ÄúEven though I'm not as big of a threat, I haven't made enemies out of the remaining contestants, except for Heather but she doesn't like us anyway.‚Äù

Confessional Ends

Thunder crashed through the skies above Camp Wawanakwa, and with the rain showing no signs of letting up, the three campers still outside wordlessly decided to take refuge in their cabins. Ella closed the door to the girls' cabin, and Shawn closed the door to the guys‚Äô.

The scene flashed ahead, revealing that the common area had begun to flood. The cabins were still on high ground, but other parts of the camp were not so lucky. Birds flew past the camera and a series of objects began to float by: first an Adirondack chair, then the Arts and Crafts Center, a log ridden by a trio of raccoons, and even a squirrel perched on top a metal periscope.

The camera panned up to the sky and the scene progressed forward accompanied by the sound of a loon and an angelic chorus as the rain was replaced by the sun.

Chef began to ring a handbell, the shot moving back to show him standing on the porch of the mess hall with a pot of something next to him.

Chris rode up on his ATV, a look of mild concern on his face. ""Hey Chef,"" he asked, ""you seen the campers?""

""No!"" Chef replied. ""And I peeled a whole bag of rotten spuds!"" he said, lifting up his pot and showing off the spoiled potatoes within.

""Hmm, I can't find them either!"" Chris admitted as he took another look around the campgrounds. ""Come to think of it, I can't even find their cabins!"" The camera zoomed out from his perturbed face to show an empty clearing.

The scene cut to one of the cabins floating on the water alongside Cody's trailer. In the foreground, a few things floated by ‚Äì mostly chairs, including one being ridden by a trio of raccoons, but more importantly, a bunk bed with Ella on top and Heather on the bottom, both sleeping calmly.

Shawn burst out of the door to the cabin with a yawn, taking a step and falling into the water. The splash woke up Heather, who cried out when she saw the water so close to her, and also fell in. That splash in turn caused Ella to stir, and with a shout of ""What?!"" she became the third camper to fall into the lake.

""What's going on?"" Cody asked with a yawn, stepping out of his trailer. His eyes popped open when he spotted the water, and he stood in place.

""How should I know? Why don't you ask the leeches?"" Heather told him, shaking the leeches off her arm with a scream.

""This is so ridiculous,"" Shawn griped before a passing shark fin shut him up. It circled past him, Heather, and Ella, forcing all three to yell and leap from the water.

The footage flashed ahead to show Heather standing with Ella on the lone cabin and Shawn and Cody together on the trailer. They shivered as they watched the girls' bunk bed collapse into the lake, and a freshwater shark jumped out of the water and took a bite out of a passing chair.

""Oh crap,"" Shawn said in a panic. ""I hope Zeke is okay!""

Confessional: Ezekiel

The static cut to another confessional from Ezekiel, already in-progress. ""I can come off as naive, but I'm not stupid,"" Ezekiel told the outhouse. ""I can tell when someone's trying to play me like a toy, and I can tell when someone's lying,"" he smiled. ""And plus, I get high scores on my assignments.‚Äù

His stomach growled, and he raised an eyebrow at this. ""I've been in here for a while now. Is it even safe to go outside yet?""

Confessional Ends

The camera cut outside, revealing that the outhouse confessional had also been swept away from camp and was now adrift in the middle of an unnamed body of water. Ezekiel stuck his head out of the door and was flabbergasted. ""How much did it even rain?"" he lamented before going back inside. ""At least I have something to drink if I get thirsty.""

The scene cut to Cody's shoes as they stepped onto sand, the camera pulling back to show that the trailer and cabin had beached itself at an odd angle and its four passengers had ventured onto dry land. A variety of plants dotted the area; oddly, several were in pots.

""Is anybody else freaked out by this deserted island?"" Shawn said, wide eyes darted around.

""Puh-lease,"" Heather told him. ""Any moron could see that this is one of Chris' cheesy production sets with fake props."" She kicked a nearby rock in frustration, and stubbed her toe.

""Yeah, it's probably just a challenge!"" Cody added.

""I doubt it,"" Ella said. ""The producers will send someone to pick us up since we have drifted away.""

Confessional: Chris

""Just to set the record straight,"" Chris said indignantly in the outhouse confessional, ""my sets are not cheesy! I lost three interns moving those rocks into place. And about that search party?"" He crossed his arms and shook his head. ""Nuh-uh! Those campers are on their own!""

Confessional Ends

The scene cut over to Chris and Chef, still standing outside the mess hall. ""So I guess that means craft day is canceled,"" the host said. ""Aaanyway, I'm starved. Let's eat!"" he looked at Chef and the pot of rotten potatoes he carried.

""You actually wanna eat this slop?!"" Chef asked in stunned disbelief.

""Shyeah, right!"" Chris chuckled. ""I meant the breakfast buffet back at our camp.""

""Cool,"" Chef said, giving him a thumbs up and a snickering push on his companion's chest. Chris playfully pushed him back, the force of which annoyed the hulking man enough for him to frown and shove the host off-camera.

Confessional: Ella

""Being stuck on a deserted island can't be too bad,"" Ella confessed. ""We still have each other after all.""

Confessional: Cody

""Two guys and two girls on one island,"" Cody said in his turn at the outhouse. ""I don't think we'll be able to win any arguments here when talking about survival.""

Confessional: Shawn

""So they left me here to die? Remind me again why I signed up for this show?"" Shawn sighed.

Confessional: Heather

""Mental note: Never sign up for a reality show ever again,"" Heather complained.

Confessionals End

""The best thing we can do is make this place survivable until the rescue team gets here,"" Ella announced.

""What if there isn't a rescue team?‚Äù Shawn doubted her. ‚ÄúWe should build a raft and try to sail back to camp.‚Äù

""If we're going to do one or the other, I don't want to starve while we're doing it. I'm gonna go get some food for us!"" Cody promised and ran past the nearby shrubs and soon out of sight.

""We're not lost. This is just Chris' lame attempt at challenging our shipwrecked survival skills. I'm onto you, Chris!"" Heather shouted at the sky.

Confessional: Chris

""Oooooooohhhh, I'm so scared!"" Chris laughed mockingly.

Confessional Ends

""I'm going for a walk,"" Heather told the others, storming off down the beach and leaving Shawn and Ella alone together.

Confessional: Heather

""Things were getting really tense,"" Heather explained in the confessional. ""You have to remember that we were soaked, covered in bug bites, and starving. But I kept my wits about me, as always. It's a good thing at least one of us can remain calm and collected in the face of adversity.""

Confessional Ends

The queen bee poked her head through some potted shrubs, and her face lit up. ""Not bad!"" she said with a growing smile. ""Beats sleeping on the beach!"" As she spoke, the camera zoomed out to reveal a large and well-built treehouse nearby, with a ladder leading up to its front porch from the beach.

Confessional: Ezekiel

Ezekiel was curled into a fetal position and darted his eyes around. ""So somehow you got swept away from camp last night. It's not that bad,"" he told himself. ""Just gotta stay inside until-"" a dull thud shook the outhouse, and the homeschooled guy's face brightened. ""That better be what I think it is!""

Confessional Ends

The point-of-view moved outside, revealing that the small building had washed up on a sandy beach. A short triumphant tune played as Ezekiel opened the door and joyfully shouted ""Land!"" He took a few steps forward. ""I'm back at camp! Never thought I'd be happy to see it!""

Ezekiel moved forward past the various types and sizes of potted plants on the shore. He pushed his way through a large bush, and bumped into something vaguely white and pointy. He looked up, and the camera pulled back to show what looked like the skull and partial skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus rex. ""SKELETON DINOSAUR!!!"" he screamed, backing up in a panic before zipping at full speed to the inside of the confessional. ""I'll stay here for just a little bit.""

Confessional: Chris

""The T. rex skull was my idea,"" Chris happily admitted to the outhouse camera with a laugh. ""Did you see the look on his face? That was worth every intern!""

Confessional Ends

""Nice view,"" Heather told herself as she stood on the treehouse porch. ""Hey, you two! If you're done yelling at each other, I found us a place to rest!"" She threw open the door and gasped when what looked like a human skeleton dropped down from the ceiling. Startled, she took a step backwards and fell to the ground with a crash.

The camera cut to Ella and Shawn, who perked their heads up from what they were doing below the field of view.

""Was that Heather?"" Shawn asked first.

""Let's go see if she's alright,"" Ella exclaimed and dashed off screen. Shawn gave a small shrug and followed as well.

The two caught up to Heather on the beach below the treehouse, where she had already gotten to her feet and began dusting herself off. ""What happened?"" Ella asked.

""Something just popped out and knocked me to the ground,"" Heather told them.

""What was it even?"" Shawn asked.

""That I don't even want to know,"" Heather told them as she started to climb the ladder again.

A flash took the scene back to Ezekiel. ‚ÄúI'm all alone!!‚Äù the prairie boy wailed and opened the door to the outhouse. His mood brightened up when he spotted something in the distance. ""Hey,"" the shot focused on something in the trees, ""are those coconuts?""

Confessional: Chef Hatchet/Chris

""Will someone please explain to me why there are palm trees and coconuts up here?"" Chef angrily asked, the confessional camera zoomed in close. ""We're in northern Ontario!""

The camera pulled back to show Chris seated next to the cook. ""They were leftover props from the 'Bigassic Park' movie shoot,"" he explained. ""What? We're on a budget!""

Confessional Ends

The scene was focused on a pile of cracked coconuts lying on the floor. Another coconut was heard being cracked and drank from, and the camera panned up to show an unstable Ezekiel lying by a tree.

‚ÄúIt's been nine minutes since I've been isolated. This is almost like camping eh,‚Äù Ezekiel emphasized as he pulled out an uncracked coconut and talked to it. ‚ÄúThese coconuts are tasty, but they can't compare to you, right Mr. Coconut?‚Äù He moved the coconut in order to make it nod.

‚ÄúI knew we'd be on the same page as usual,‚Äù Ezekiel hugged Mr. Coconut. ‚ÄúIt's just me and you. We'll hunt, forage, and survive together and never die!‚Äù He then squeezed his legs together. ‚ÄúThanks to your dead friends, I need to pee. Come on.‚Äù He stood on his feet and walked out of the scene with Mr. Coconut. ‚ÄúFeel free to look the other way.‚Äù

""It's just a prop!"" Heather shouted as she poked the skeleton hanging in the treehouse doorway. ""This is just like when they sent us to Boney Island. Don't you see? It's so obviously another survival challenge! You can't scare me, Chris!""

""What if you're wrong?"" Shawn asked, who had joined the queen bee on the treehouse porch. ""We can't take any chances here. We should build a raft and figure out where we are.""

""If we are stranded on a deserted island,"" Ella objected, also on the porch, ""it's better if we just stay where we are for now, and let the producers know where we are by making a fire in order to make things easier for them.""

Confessional: Chef Hatchet/Chris

""I'm gonna let that little comment pass,"" Chris said, unamused. Still in the outhouse with him, Chef grimaced and nodded.

Confessional: Heather

""I was so better off without those lunatics holding me back. Good luck lost in the wild without shelter,"" Heather admitted with an annoyed look.

Confessional: Ella

""Looking back,"" Ella admitted, ""splitting up wasn't a good idea. What if a T. rex were to come around and eat one of us? What then?‚Äù

Confessionals End

""Well then,"" Shawn suggested, ""let's just make the rule every camper for themselves!""

""Fine,"" Heather said and headed back inside.

Ella looked between them and sighed. ""Fine,"" she agreed.

The footage flashed forward, showing Shawn and Ella back on the beach. They gave each other one last look before heading off in different directions. Ella picked up a green backpack off the ground, while Shawn started to head inland.

(Commercial Break)

The shot moved to the outhouse, its door wide open and with eleven tally marks drawn on it. ""Eleven minutes have passed,"" Ezekiel said as he drew on Mr. Coconut's face with a marker. The coconut also had a green tuft of hair on his head. ""Me and Mr. Coconut will be spending our lives in the outhouse."" The homeschooler put his marker away, and the focus showed a red smile on the coconut.

The camera cut to the skull, and Cody stuck his head out of one of the eye sockets. ""No food here! Where am I gonna find it?"" He heard a rustling in the bushes nearby and dropped from the skeleton. The footage cut forward as Cody barged through the undergrowth until at last he stopped. ""Cool!"" he cheered, the point-of-view moving behind him and showing a pile of bananas and pineapples on the ground.

""Pineapples and bananas make an awesome fruit combo,"" Cody said as he started picking the food up until something else caught his eye. ""And as an extra bonus‚Ä¶"" Dropping his first prize, he ran over to a very large egg sitting in a nest on the ground.

Another flash forward showed the geek carrying the massive egg under one arm, and the fruit under the other. As Cody walked off, the camera lingered on the empty nest. The background music became tense and ominous as the shadow of something large and winged passed over the scene, accompanied by a prehistoric cry.

Back at the area surrounding the treehouse, Shawn was in the process of tying several logs together with vines. He looked to his left, the camera panning over to show Ella rubbing sticks together trying to start a fire. A pan up to the treehouse window revealed Heather watching them with a bored expression on her face.

Heather's stomach grumbled, and she pursed her lips. The shot cut to the base of the ladder just as Heather slid down it, earning the attention of the other two.

""Are you already tired of sitting around up there?"" Ella asked.

‚ÄúCody isn't back yet with our food, so I'm going to look for it myself,‚Äù Heather argued.

""I'm sure Cody will be back soon,"" Shawn said.

A loud, howling roar filled the air and caused all three campers to freeze in place. ""What was that?"" Ella asked in panic.

Back with Ezekiel, he slightly opened the outhouse door with Mr. Coconut in hand. ‚ÄúDon't worry, Mr. Coconut,‚Äù he consoled as he looked around. ‚ÄúYou're safe and sound with me.‚Äù A loud, howling roar filled the air and caused him to scream and close the door.

The scene immediately cut to Chef Hatchet blowing into a conch shell, producing the howling roar that had echoed through the area. ""Brunch is served,"" he stated calmly, lowering the shell. Behind him stood Chris, hungrily looking at a table of food that had been set up in front of a large green tent.

A classical British tune began to play in the background as the camera focused in on the host. ""Aaah, brunch,"" Chris said happily. ""Such a civilized meal, don't you think? You've already digested your brekkie, but you're not quite ready for lunch. Ooo-hoo-hooo,"" he lit up with a grin, swiping his finger through a thick yellow sauce, ""hollandaise! You've outdone yourself, Chef!"" He stuck the sauce in his mouth and pulled his finger back out.

Chef smiled and sounded the conch again, the scene cutting back to the campers as the roaring sound once again filled the air.

Heather's widened eyes darted around in fear for a few brief seconds before becoming very narrow. ""It's just Chris freaking us out!"" Heather gave her fellow campers one last glance before storming off.

Confessional: Heather

‚ÄúOkay. I have never been more terrified in my whole life. They left me there alone on that island to die,‚Äù Heather sadly emphasized. ‚ÄúI had to draw on reserves of inner strength I never knew I had. If you're watching, Lindsay, I'm sorry that I hurt your feelings. You were an awesome friend and Beth, ditto for you. Miss you guys. BFFs forever.‚Äù

Confessional Ends

Shawn sighed. ""Well then,"" he reluctantly called, ""just be careful!"" He tightened the binding of his raft.

""So you're leaving as well?"" Ella asked him as she fanned the small flame she'd created.

""Yup,"" Shawn answered. ""Hopefully I'll be able to find camp before whatever-that-was shows up.‚Äù

Ella grimaced. ""Good luck then!""

""Thanks,"" Shawn said before shoving his raft into the water and rowing off with an oar he'd found off-camera.

Ella resumed putting her full attention on the budding fire, the footage cutting forward a few minutes to show it having advanced to one similar to the campfire pit. She looked at it in achievement, but her face fell when her stomach began to growl.

""I'll just get something to eat quickly,"" Ella said aloud and walked away.

She'd only made it a few feet before Cody barged through the bushes beside her, knocking the fairytale princess to the ground.

""Awesome!"" Cody cheered as he noticed the fire. ""With this fire, I can make some scrambled eggs!""

""Pardon me!"" Ella interrupted, already back on her feet. ""You just knocked me down without any consideration!""

""Oops. I didn't see you there,"" Cody said sheepishly. ‚ÄúMy bad.‚Äù

""It's alright,"" Ella said, eying what the short boy was carrying. ""I'll let you use the fire, but can you please give me a fruit?""

""Fine,"" Cody tossed a pineapple to his fellow camper, and took the giant egg over to the fire.

Confessional: Cody

""I am not a big fan of raw eggs,"" Cody told the confessional. ""The first time I ate them, I spent the whole afternoon puking my guts out.""

Confessional Ends

Ezekiel and Mr. Coconut were shown again, this time sitting on top of a palm tree and scanning the treetops. ‚ÄúWe need to find food to eat, alright Mr. Coconut?‚Äù He looked at the beach until he noticed a trail of smoke rising nearby. ""Fire?"" the homeschooler muttered in confusion before his eyes widened. ""That means there are people out here!""

The scene moved back to the host and cook, a tropical party beat filling the air as the focus was placed on a limbo bar set to the highest notch in the foreground. In the background, Chef sat on the ground by a trailer and beat on a drum as Chris came into view, leaning back and passing under the limbo bar.

""Ah, fun in the great outdoors,"" he said. ""Too bad the interns are missing it. We should send them a video of this!"" he added, turning around and limboing back. ""Good times!""

The focus moved to Shawn paddling across the water. ""Uggh,"" he groaned as he peered out at the shores around him, ""I can't find anything!‚Äù He continued paddling for a few more moments before a prehistoric cry caught his attention, distinctly different from the one he'd heard before leaving.

Shawn looked up and saw a winged shadow pass over him. ""It's headed for the treehouse!"" the conspiracy nut exclaimed. ""I gotta help the others!"" He shifted his position and began to paddle hard and fast.

The scene shifted to Cody and Ella sitting by the fire. Another fierce cry echoed over them, the two contestants startled as a giant goose ‚Äì the same kind that nested on Boney Island ‚Äì swooped down on them. They cried out and jumped apart, Cody taking the egg with him. The monster goose took notice and focused on the geek, landing briefly to assault the human boy with wings and toothy beak.

Cody managed to dodge the attacks and rolled closer to the fire. ""Just give the goose the egg!"" Ella cried out but to no avail.

‚ÄúNo need to worry! I can fight this bird off!‚Äù Cody drew a pineapple and held it like a sword at the bird.

Before he could swing, the goose slammed him with its head, knocking the gap-toothed boy over and sending his weapon flying.

‚ÄúUh oh!"" Ella shouted as the pineapple sailed through the fire and all the way to the treehouse, bouncing off the porch railing and falling to the sand. Ignoring Cody fighting with the goose, Ella rushed over and stomped the burning pineapple out.

The singer sighed in relief, but a crackling sound above her caught her attention as she looked up in horror to see that the treehouse had caught on fire.

Heather was shown again, walking through the woods eating a banana while carrying more in her pockets. She then noticed smoke rising above the trees. ""Wow,"" she muttered. ""Ella actually managed to start a fire!""

Ezekiel paused his walk to check the smoke in the sky. ""Is the smoke getting bigger or is it just me?"" he asked himself before starting to move faster.

The scene switched back to the burning treehouse. The camera panned down to Ella gaping as she looked from the growing blaze, to Cody still battling the monster goose over the egg, and lastly to the beach. ""What to do, what to do?"" she asked in a panic.

""WHAT IS THIS?!"" She was interrupted by a furious Heather, who stormed into the scene. ""I leave to get some food, and I find my treehouse on fire?! What happened?!""

""I didn't start the fire!"" Ella said defensively.

Before Heather could say anything else, Ezekiel ran up to the two after brushing through the bushes.

""I'm glad to see you guys are still alive,"" Ezekiel told them, ""but why is there a fire?!"" He peeked at the fire, then noticed the battle between Cody and the goose. ""And why is Cody not getting any help against a goose?""

""Why didn't you stop the fire?"" Heather focused on Ella.

""It happened too quickly!"" Ella told her. ""I couldn't do anything!""

Shawn then arrived on the scene. ""What is that?!"" he said in panic. Spotting Cody being attacked by a giant goose while Ezekiel tried to separate them, he grabbed his oar and began to run.

He swung as hard as he could and aimed for the goose. Cody finally dropped the egg and was pulled away by Ezekiel, and the goose took off with its egg after recovering.

""That goose wasn't messing around,"" Cody mumbled and made eye contact with Shawn. ‚ÄúHey Shawn!""

""We have to put that fire out before it spreads!"" Shawn spotted the other two campers and the potted plants. ""Heather! Ella!"" he called out as they walked over to him. ""You two and Cody have to move as many plants away from this tree as you can before they catch on fire!"" He then grabbed one of the smaller potted plants and attempted to tip it over. ""Ezekiel! Give me a hand with these pots!""

The homeschooler went over to help him, as did Ella and Cody, but Heather didn't act. ""Why should we risk our lives to fight this fire?"" she wondered.

""Because if we don't,"" Ella shot back as she and Cody moved a plant, ""it could spread to the entire island and kill us! Now put your pride aside and help us!""

Heather sighed and went over to them.

The scene moved back to Chef and Chris, seated on stools on opposite sides of a stump, sipping coffee brewed using a coffee maker on the stump.

""So Chef,"" Chris said, ""how do you think our campers are doing on their deserted island?""

""Anything could've happened to 'em by now,"" Chef answered with a smile. ""Mauled by bears, fell off a cliff, starved to death...""

As Chef went on, the camera focused in on an increasingly thoughtful Chris. ""Hmm...maybe I should go check the monitors and see what kind of footage we got,"" he suggested.

""Chris, man,"" Chef told him, ""you are one dedicated host."" The larger man picked the handsome host up and began to cradle him in his arms as though he was a child. ""You're an inspiration!""

""Thanks, dude,"" Chris told him. ""It's what I do.""

The shot flashed back to the campers as they worked against the flames. Heather, Ella, and Cody were shown tearing up the bushes and putting them away in a pile before they caught fire.

Shawn and Ezekiel were shown next. They carried a pot full of water up the beach and hurled it onto the fire. Most of it missed the fire, but enough did hit to extinguish a corner of the treehouse porch. They carried the flower pot back down the beach. On the way, they were joined by Cody, Ella, and Heather carrying a second, larger flower pot that they splashed onto the fire.

The scene skipped ahead to the smoldering remains of the tree and building. The five campers were looking at it from the beach, tired but smiling at the result of their work.

""Great job!"" Shawn told them all. ""I knew we could do it if we worked together!""

""Heck yeah!"" Cody cheered. ""That fire never stood a chance!""

""I know we did a good job,"" Heather spoke up, ""but now we don't have a shelter, and we don't know if somebody will come rescue us.""

""We still have my raft,"" Shawn suggested. ""We could try finding camp again if we all had paddles.""

""And what if we can't find any more?"" Ezekiel countered and held Mr. Coconut tight to him. ""What happens then?""

""I guess we'll find somewhere else to spend the night,"" Ella told him.

‚ÄúYou know, if this is a challenge, Chris'll have to come get us eventually since he can't let us die,"" Cody said.

""He should have gotten us as soon as we got flooded,"" Heather argued.

At that moment, Cody's stomach growled. ""Aww!"" he exclaimed. ""I didn't even get to eat yet!""

""How about we eat before we decide what to do,"" Ella suggested.

""No one is eating Mr. Coconut, eh,"" Ezekiel warned the campers. ""He's staying alive, and I know where we can find a lot of coconuts.""

‚ÄúI'm going to ignore your obsession with a coconut and focus on the food location,"" Shawn agreed.

Confessional: Heather

‚ÄúMr. Coconut?‚Äù Heather spoke in bewilderment. ‚ÄúJust when you thought Ezekiel couldn't get any stranger‚Ä¶‚Äù

Confessional Ends

The scene flashed forward, showing the five teens sitting around the fire Ella had built earlier that day, eating and looking relaxed.

""And that,"" Ella finished with a proud smile, ""is how I won my first singing competition.‚Äù

‚ÄúHarold told me this one time about how he almost got third place in his school archery competition, until he put an arrow through his principal's leg,‚Äù Ezekiel revealed. ‚ÄúHe does still have another two years of detention to look forward to, but his archery skills are almost as good as mine.‚Äù

""I spy‚Ä¶"" Cody interrupted, standing up and moving his head around as he looked over the treetops. ""More smoke coming from over there!"" The camera showed the existence of a faint plume of smoke billowing far in the distance.

""Is that the rescue team?"" Heather said first.

""Camp?"" Ella said second.

""It better not be Chris messing with us,"" Shawn added.

Cody reared himself up in excitement. ""That's gotta be the finish line, and I'm going to be the first to reach it!"" Before they could get back to their feet, he had run off.

""Not if I beat you to it!"" Heather said, scrambling into a run after him.

Ezekiel grinned before he too took off toward the smoke and took Mr. Coconut along. Shawn and Ella shared a glance, and followed shortly after.

The scene cut to Cody bursting out from the bushes, surprising Chris and Chef. ""Yes,"" he cheered. ""I got here first! That means I won the challenge!"" The other four campers emerged not long after.

""Hey guys,"" Chris said with a quickly-donned smile. ""It's about time you showed up!""

""I won the challenge, right?"" Cody asked excitedly. ""We were supposed to get back here first.""

""Not really,"" Chris explained. ""I kinda wanted to see what you guys would do if you thought you were stranded on a deserted island for the day.""

""So they were going to come rescue us,"" Ezekiel told Mr. Coconut. ""We freaked out over nothing.""

‚ÄúUh, why is he talking to a coconut?‚Äù Chef felt disturbed by Ezekiel's behavior.

""This is our production crew's secret location,"" Chris explained as the camera panned around the area, showing a truck, the tent, and the buffet table, as well as the helicopter parked in the background and a bear eating a sandwich. The campers gasped, and the host continued in annoyance. ""Or was a secret ‚Äòtil now.""

""But‚Ä¶ what about the T. rex skull?"" Heather asked in disbelief.

Chris chuckled. ""Oh, those are just left over from a dinosaur movie that was-""

""You mean while we were shipwrecked, you were here basking in the lap of luxury a mere hundred feet away?!"" Heather asked irritably.

It began to rain again, to the five teens' dismay. ""Yes, Heather. That would be accurate,"" Chris said happily as he and Chef retreated into their trailer. ""Sorry, I'd invite you in, but there's only room for seven,"" he told them unapologetically. ""See you at the campfire tonight!""

He slammed the trailer door shut, and the gaping campers looked from it to the thundering sky above.

The footage cut forward to the campfire ceremony. ""Weeelllll,"" Chris opened, ""it's been a grueling day, campers. Frankly, Chef and I are worn out! I hope you've learned two valuable lessons. First, always make sure your cabins are securely fastened to the ground. And second, the 'every camper for themselves' idea sucks. Five heads are always better than one.""

The shot finally cut to the campers. ""Which brings us to yet another dramatic marshmallow ceremony, one that will be decided by me,"" the host continued as he brought out his plate of four treats. ‚ÄúShawn,"" he called out with the accompanying tosses, ""Ezekiel, Ella."" The three caught their prizes, leaving Cody and Heather waiting.

""Heather, you initially refused to help put out a burning treehouse before coming to your senses,"" Chris explained to the apathetic girl. ""And Cody, your recklessness nearly got everyone killed by the forest fire."" The host's expression turned serious. ""I could've been caught in that fire as well if you didn't put it out. For that reason, I'm putting you out of the game."" He gave the last marshmallow to Heather.

Upon hearing Chris' words, Cody's jaw gaped at first. ‚ÄúI didn't mean to start that fire,‚Äù he pouted.

""Regardless,"" Chris went on, ""the Dock of Shame's that way.""

‚ÄúTake Mr. Coconut with you,‚Äù Ezekiel handed Cody the coconut. ‚ÄúI don't want him to get hurt on this island.‚Äù

Cody eyed the coconut in his hands with keen interest. ""I'll keep the coconut safe,‚Äù he gave a thumbs up to Ezekiel. ‚ÄúBye guys!"" he said to the Final Four and calmly walked down to the docks.

""Well then,"" Chris addressed the teens still seated, ""congratulations on making it to the Final Four. I'll see you all tomorrow.""

After the host left, the four exchanged wary looks.

Cody was shown walking down the Dock of Shame. He got a surprise when he saw Sky waiting on the boat for him. ‚ÄúSky?!‚Äù

‚ÄúHey Cody!‚Äù Sky waved at him as he got on the boat. ""I heard you were kicked off and wanted to see you again.""

‚ÄúOur time away from each other was short, but-‚Äù Cody said before Sky kissed him on the lips for a while. ‚ÄúWha-‚Äù

‚ÄúNow that we'll be with each other for a while at the place we're going to, I'd like for us to get into a relationship,‚Äù Sky said. ‚ÄúIf that's okay with you.‚Äù

Cody smiled dopily and said ""I'd like that.""

The camera cut to the boat's retreating form and Cody was heard saying ""Wait, which place?‚Äù

Some excerpts from the article, and additional resources are below:

#1) Make Windows Safer, Day and Night:

Around 1 billion birds (United States) and 25 million birds (Canada) die every year by flying into glass windows. This includes windows at all levels from low level houses to high rise buildings.

!Window collisions are one of the largest threats to bird populations. However, there are several ways you can help reduce window fatality. Below are some links with steps on how to make your house bird friendly, either DIY or through reputable companies such as the American Bird Conservancy.

#2) Keep Cats Indoors

!Cats are estimated to kill more than 2.4 billion birds annually in the U.S. and Canada. This is the #1 human-caused reason for the loss of birds, aside from habitat loss.

#3) Reduce Lawn, Plant Natives

Birds have fewer places to safely rest during migration and to raise their young: More than 10 million acres of land in the United States were converted to developed land from 1982 to 1997

[Find out which native plants are best for your area](https://www.audubon.org/native-plants)

#4) Avoid Pesticides

More than 1 billion pounds of pesticides are applied in the United States each year. The continent‚Äôs most widely used insecticides, called neonicotinoids or ‚Äúneonics,‚Äù are lethal to birds and to the insects that birds consume.

#5) Drink Coffee That‚Äôs Good for Birds

Three-quarters of the world‚Äôs coffee farms grow their plants in the sun, destroying forests that birds and other wildlife need for food and shelter. Sun-grown coffee also often requires using environmentally harmful pesticides and fertilizers. On the other hand, shade-grown coffee preserves a forest canopy that helps migratory birds survive the winter.

#6) Protect Our Planet from Plastic

It‚Äôs estimated that 4,900 million metric tons of plastic have accumulated in landfills and in our environment worldwide, polluting our oceans and harming wildlife such as seabirds, whales, and turtles that mistakenly eat plastic, or become entangled in it.

#7) Watch Birds, Share What You See

Monitoring birds is essential to help protect them, but tracking the health of the world‚Äôs 10,000 bird species is an immense challenge.

Full story - I spilled an iced coffee over the passenger seat of my car (fabric seats üò¨) and within a few days it started to stink. Despite using upholstery cleaner, a carpet cleaner machine (Vax Spotwash), bicarbonate of soda in socks, took the car to a professional valet (I think they did a piss-poor job) and airing out all the windows, the car still smells funky. Granted, the smell has improved but it‚Äôs still there and I want it gone. My worry is that the liquid seeped all the way in to the seat so cleaning products can‚Äôt reach there and the machine isn‚Äôt strong enough to extract it?

I figured since enzyme cleaners are used for pet or vomit smells it could be used to kill the bacteria causing the smell in my car?

1k4rvfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1k4rvfh/aio_birthday_breakup/,AIO - Birthday Breakup,"Hi Guys! First ever REDDIT post here! :) 

So for background, me and my ex were going really well. I mean the dates were beyond magical we're talking Disney movie stuff in live action (and it being successful, taking a jab at you Disney live-action box office bombs.) The week of my birthday, everything was going swell. We talked about plans and everything for what we were going to do. 2 days before my birthday, mentally he wasn't well so I left him alone while he could gather his thoughts. When I did, I was making plans behind his back so when I saw him on my birthday it could make his day and brighten up whatever had him down, making my birthday as much as it was for me, for him too. Getting him a ring pop since it was an inside joke between us, a lil book surprise and a coffee for him just to brighten his mood. Anything I could do to brighten him up and share my birthday with him. A lil mental getaway and make that day an escape for us. Day of the birthday, I weirdly could tell something was off: his happy birthday wasn't a ""Happy Birthday I cant wait to see you! Ive missed talking to you yadayada."" It was just a ""Happy birthday."" Mind you me and him haven't talked in two days and he usually tended to send like paragraphs confessing his feelings as good morning texts or calls.

I ended up asking about if we were on for today, and he cancelled the whole date we had planned for frankly, weeks. I had a gut feeling he wanted to breakup, just with him cancelling and not offering an alternative like: ""Lets ft and do XYZ! Or let's play video games to cheer you up!"" Sadly he had informed me that it's been on his mind since he has to improve himself and it's more of a him thing of figuring himself out compared to an actual problem with our relationship. At best he was able to offer how terrible he feels that it had to happen today of all days and how I should try to stay positive even though I planned my whole day around being with him. Despite all this, we are on good terms and in no way is he at fault for anything because that'd be immature and selfish not to understand what he's going through even though I know nothing about it and talks of rekindling when he figures himself out have been brought because it's not like he chose to go through something and had it happen on the worst day possible. It's a double-edged sword. I will never be mad at him nor sad at him as a person, only the action of it happening. Kinda separating art from the artist.

Now this is where you come in REDDIT. Just is it weird im still an emotional wreck over everything? Just the fact that we had to breakup on my birthday because of what's happening with him or is am I overreacting for being an emotional wreck, because he's told me on numerous occasions of how I did nothing wrong, I was amazing and he wouldn't trade it for anything else but just deep down, I just feel still so hurt that all I wanted for my 22nd birthday was to spend it with him in some caliber especially with the plans and ideas I wanted to make and frankly my whole birthday weekend I was an emotional rollercoaster.",1,1745277956.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False
1k4rva4,https://www.reddit.com/r/JavaProgramming/comments/1k4rva4/what_do_java_developers_think_about_these_other/,What do Java Developers think about these other Languages,"**""Java is Horrible"" \~(They Say)**

It seems like everywhere I go, everyone is ""hating"" on Java and making fun of it:  Usually with the obligatory ""FactoryFactory"" joke, while all the Java Devs are silent on the matter.  At this point, it's almost become a MEME where I can picture all the Java Devs reading these kinds of comments and getting a chuckle out of it, as they're sipping on Coffee !!!  ...Perfectly secure in their choice of language & platform despite what some ""rando"" says on the internet !!!  lol

But what's a little weird, is that all the Java Critics are completely silent about C#.NET (dotnet), despite the two languages being VERY SIMILAR ?!?!  Only Java gets ""shit on"" ?

But me personally, I think the truth is that Java is a beautiful language.  And the only ""horrible"" thing about it, is that it's so well designed that it makes all others pale in comparison.  So, I'm always finding myself ""nitpicking"" other languages and their design choices.

So, now that I've been really wanting to branch out and learn some other languages, it does make it really difficult to decide which language I want to learn next.  So, I would really like some input here.

**Bash**: Tons of little quirks & ""gotchas"", but ultimately, it was very easy to learn.  Also, it was nice not having to ""spin up"" an entire new project (and build system), and hence, being able to jump in and quickly get started with playing around with different proof-of-concept ideas.  Altho, I quickly reached the ""limits"" of what Bash is capable of (as far as speed of execution).

**C/C++**: This is just begging the question of why you would choose one over the other ?  Like, apparently, C++ has OOP constructs, but it's a little bizarre looking at some code examples and they're referencing a data structure by it's implementation (""vector"", for example) instead of it's interface ?  Like, WTF ?

So, maybe C is a better choice ?  It doesn't have OOP built-in, but I have heard that it is possible to organize code in an OOP fashion ?  And I would just use ""vtables"" &/or ""function pointers"" to implement polymorhpic behavior ?  But I would also lose a lot of ""quality-of-life"" features of C++ ?  Like, I wonder what it would look like to consume and construct a Dictionary/Map/Table ?

oh, and the major ""clockblock"" of C and C++ would be having to learn an entirely new build system as well: I think they mostly use ""Make"" and ""CMake"" ?  Which, at a glance, look like stepping onto an entirely new Planet (compared to Ant & Maven), lol.  For me, Maven was a nightmare to learn, but Ant was fairly easy.

**HolyC**:  So maybe this is the real answer to the dichotomy between C and C++ ?  But I wonder:  Is this even a realistic option ?  lol

**php**: Looks like it shares a lot of similarities with Java (at first glance), but like Java, it would force end-users to install php to be able to run my scripts ?  Whereas, with stuff like Bash, Perl, & Python, I get the impression that they are already included (with most distributions) ?

**Perl**: Looks pretty similar to Bash ?  And also has the familiar curley-brace and semi-colon notation.  But with Java, we ""pass the value by reference"" (so-to-speak) and this happens automatically, whereas with Perl, if I'm forced to make the declaration that ""yes, I want to pass by reference"", then I might as well almost be using C or C++ ?  Altho, it does have interesting OOP features.  Like ""Holy Fvck"", ""Blessing"" Objects seems like something that should have been included with HolyC !!!  LOL.  Otherwise, looks like a really interesting language, imo.

**Python**: Very popular nowadays, but where TF are the TYPES ?  Like, it's really bizarre that I would create a function, ask for the parameters that I require to perform the work, but there's no protection against API Consumers passing the wrong TYPE into the function ???  Like, what if the parameter is a function, or, is supposed to implement a specific method ?

**Rust/Go/Zig/Jai**:  These languages have some really interesting ideas, but working with Java for so long has trained my brain to think a certain way:

Like specifically with respect to ""wiring objects"" together:  That if I'm creating a method (or function), that I simply ASK for TYPE of information that is required to perform the work/task.  So, the list of parameters naturally becomes ""(Type identifier)"" (which also applies to C/C++/C#).  Whereas, with Rust/Go/Zig/Jai, they do ""(identifier : Type)"".  And this is completely backwards imo, since you're putting the most important information ""on the back burner"", while the NAME (a mere implementation detail) is declared first ?  Trying to wrap my around on the reason why, and the usual answer is inferred types and having the type declaration optional ?

**tldr;** I know that there are a lot of other languages as well, but I was primarily curious about these specific languages and what Java Devs think about them, and also, what they recommend as a second language (in general), and things that beginners might need to ""watch out for"" that might trip them up ?

I live in a popular tourism city on the West Coast and have a job with perks that allow me to share free entry to a lot of very expensive attractions with friends & family. I often let them stay in my guest room if it‚Äôs for 3 days or less.

Sometimes, my friends/family from out of town will ask if they can bring a friend along, which is absolutely fine. No one has ever been a disrespectful houseguest, they are all kind and personable. I love meeting new people and having visitors in the house for these short periods of time.

However, am I overreacting by being kind of burnt out by the fact that these friends-of-friends rarely do anything to show their thanks? (It‚Äôs not the same people repeatedly, I‚Äôm talking different ppl each time). If I were these people brought along‚Äîstaying in a stranger‚Äôs home, receiving an occasional ride, and using my benefits that save them literally hundreds or even thousands of dollars, I would be mortified if I didn‚Äôt bring a small token of thanks or pay for dinner if we were all out together, etc. 

I‚Äôd think it was a financial thing, but they buy themselves souvenirs, treats, alcohol etc. Plus, if there‚Äôs a few guests total, you all really can‚Äôt scrounge up a little bit each for like a coffee gift card or something, when I just gave you an almost free vacation?? I‚Äôm not a high earner at all, and I still can‚Äôt imagine not budgeting for this before agreeing to go on a trip this way. We are also all in our late 20s-30s, so not unaware, broke college kids. 

I‚Äôm not sure whether I‚Äôm being unreasonable or not. I don‚Äôt want to mentally nickel and dime my guests for hospitality that I agreed to, of course. I know the obvious answer is to stop hosting people, but like I said, I enjoy the visits otherwise so would prefer not to totally ban visitors (will if I have to, though). Obviously I‚Äôm not going to say to my family/friends ‚Äúyou can bring a friend but only if they take me out for dinner‚Äù lol. I think I just feel hurt and taken for granted.

I am fully open to you all telling me I‚Äôm being petty and should just open a damn hotel if I‚Äôm expecting something from my guests, but is it no longer the norm to do something for a host that helped you out?

about me: I'm 28 and from the eastern united states. I'm a huge nerd for animals and nature, and I love learning about entomology, paleontology, and marine biology. I enjoy gaming and have over 4k hours in one of my favorite video games. I also like crafting and make my own stuffed animals by hand. I enjoy hanging out in quiet cafes, visiting museums, and regularly going to my local aquarium to see my favorite penguin. I collect stickers, trinkets, decorative birds, and sanrio merch. I love hello kitty, iced coffee, disco music, vintage tech, and video essays on theme park history. overall I'd say I'm pretty easygoing and straightforward. I love unironic enthusiasm about the little things in life.

I was at a coffee shop with an old friend chit chatting nothing specific. She had to go to work so she gets up and leaves while I sit for just a bit longer. I turn to leave my chair and see another friend I wasn't super close to but decided to stop and say hi. We chatted for a bit and she asked if I wanted to go to a concert with her. (Immediately in my active mind I was thinking about how I didn't want to go to that city and my husband definitely wouldn't want me to go without him). I asked what time because I go to bed at 8 ""like an old lady"" and kind of chuckled to myself. She exclaimed ""8 O CLOCK???"" And got the attention of everyone in the room. Awkwardly laughing i said I'd let her know and left. 
I make my way home, that isn't actually my home, and my husband was outside on the phone. He had been chopping wood and had the axe next to him. Hanging up and hearing me come up the driveway he said ""my dad died a while ago and no one told me"" I didn't know how to react. He had gotten off the phone with his mom who told him she couldn't live without his dad so my husband knew she'd be dead shortly after. (they've been divorced for over 20 years so that doesnt make a ton of sense) Through tears he starts throwing split logs onto a pile next to me. We were talking but that was the first thing I forgot upon waking up. I told him to meet me somewhere and left again.

This is where things got weird. 

I walked into what looked like a mall type building, to what was suppose to be a food court but without open restaurant fronts, they were all closed. Instead of big tables and booths, the space was FILLED with single tables and single chairs closely resembling a large classroom. It was incredibly liminal. Only a few people were there, in the middle I saw my friend who decided against going to the concert. I said hi, we chatted, and I walked back towards where I came in to sit in a chair waiting on my husband. This is where I really noticed I was wearing an oversized coat (passed down from my papaw to my mom to me. It's too big but I love it) and a cross body bag that looked like one my mom carried when I was a kid. I sit down and the bag dumps onto the floor. I was internally cursing myself for not checking the zipper as I looked down to see the mess. There's a bunch of ripped up pieces of paper, a palm sized sketch book with a ""self portrait"", pens, pencils, my current wallet and a bunch of other random junk. I lean to pick it up when suddenly a guy appears next to me. He's mirroring what I'm wearing except in all black. He's VERY close, like kneeling and could have laid his head on my thigh if he wanted. He's picking up the items, asking questions I can't hear nor can get a word in, and I realize he's similar to a young version of my husbands dad. Eventually a girl comes and ushers him away. They disappear literally and my phone rings with my husband who is calling to say he's on his way. He's upset (understandably) and says something about only having 5 years with his dad. This is where there's a shift. I sat up straight at the table and am confused. We're in our mid-20s, he's had way more than 5 years. I asked ""what do you mean you only had-"" I get KICKED OUT OF THE DREAM and finish the sentence ""-5 years with your dad"" mentally as I sit up in bed. 
I felt myself get pushed out of the dream...like physically. 

My husband is unnerved, my friend thinks it's ominous. I've never had a dream quite like that. I'm aware of the lucid dream ""don't ask about the time and date"" rule so I'm wondering if there's a relation?

1k4rfb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/1k4rfb8/what_if_multiverse/,What if multiverse,"The scene begins with a portal opening, revealing Green Lantern escaping from Bizarro for an unknown reason. The scene transitions to Doctor Strange, who is trying to open multiple portals from different universes to help defeat a massive cosmic threat. Meanwhile, Tony Stark is saying goodbye to his wife and daughter. Suddenly, Green Lantern enters through the portal by accident, escaping from Bizarro, and crashes into Tony's house. (Green Lantern had been imagining a missile from his ring for protection as he fled from Bizarro).

Tony hears the wall break and rushes to the cameras to check what happened. He sees Green Lantern and decides to track him using the city's surveillance cameras by hacking into them. Tony then attacks while wearing his vibranium suit, as he doesn't know how strong Green Lantern is or what the battle will be like. As Green Lantern is surprised by being transported to an unfamiliar place, Tony surprises him with a powerful punch that crushes his skull and kills him before Green Lantern realizes what happened. Tony arrogantly says, ""I didn't think you were this weak... Next time, don't break into your neighbor's houses.""

The portal is still open, and it's important to remember that Bizarro has extremely strong senses. He enters the portal and smells Green Lantern's distant scent. Bizarro flies quickly, though slightly confused by the changes in the environment, but still determined to find Green Lantern, his only motivation. Along the way, he hears the sound of a punch and the stopping of a heartbeat, and Tony's words echo about Green Lantern. Bizarro quickly reaches Tony, standing in front of him without speaking. Tony says, ""If you're his friend, then you won't leave before what happened to him happens to you."" Bizarro doesn't respond. Tony feels a lack of respect from Bizarro and decides to strike him with all his strength. But as Tony delivers the blow, Bizarro finds him slow and moves behind him, hitting Tony with a blow at light-speed, full of his power.

Tony is surprised, and so is Bizarro when Tony doesn't suffer from the impact. Instead, Tony ends up on top of a building. Tony calls for reinforcements, and when Sentry arrives, he warns Bizarro, ""Clean up your friend's remains and leave, you disgusting creature."" Despite Sentry's ability to match light-speed, Bizarro is millions of times faster. Sentry, unable to comprehend what just happened, finds himself near the sun. Bizarro gains strength near the sun and strikes Sentry, burning him in the sun where he cannot escape.

Later, Doctor Strange opens a portal to the Void World and instructs Thor to betray Bizarro, throwing him there without realizing it. Thor pushes Bizarro, and before doing so, Reed Richards warns that defeating him is impossible without help from Bizarro‚Äôs world. Strange opens a portal to the Justice League building and asks Batman to send a hero on the mission. Batman informs him that the Justice League has fallen apart since Arrow's death. So, Doctor Strange opens a portal in Central City, where he sees a person wearing a yellow suit and surrounded by a red aura, carrying someone in a red suit who resembles him.

Strange assumes that Reverse Flash is the hero and calls out, ""Hey, yellow cloak-wearer, can you come talk?"" Reverse Flash smells the scent of multiple dead bodies and realizes he's not from this dimension. He throws Barry into a Paris recycling bin, unconscious, and quickly returns to Strange, moving faster than light at 5 trillion times the speed of light. He had been thinking of creating an army of himself to control that world and open portals to harass all versions of Barry across the multiverse. Strange notices that Barry has disappeared and asks Reverse Flash, ""What are your abilities?"" Reverse Flash responds, ""Faster than the fastest person you‚Äôve ever met."" Strange asks, ""Can you defeat a zombie from a planet wearing a cloak that says 'S'?"" Reverse Flash laughs and replies, ""I've defeated the strongest version of him many times,"" referring to Superman.

When they arrive at the world, Strange has Thor meet all the heroes, making them think he‚Äôs a hero like them. Days go by, and they search for Bizarro, who continues to absorb energy from the sun. Reverse Flash manipulates all the heroes, breaking their trust, particularly Reed Richards and Tony Stark, as he knows they're the smartest in the group. He breaks their trust before anything else. Reverse Flash fights the villains for almost a month, while Bizarro continues to regain his strength. One day, Peter asks Reverse Flash to teach him some physics concepts, and out of nowhere, Reverse Flash kills him in his usual way (by vibrating his hand at super speed). He then quickly places him in his house, making it appear that he died of a heart attack. When the Avengers investigate Spider-Man's death, they hold a funeral and honor him. That's when the excitement begins, as Matt was present, listening to the heartbeat of Thor, realizing that Thawn was the one responsible.

The next day, Bizarro returns to Earth. Reverse Flash makes his first strike and says, ""I missed fighting people closer to my level, but you‚Äôre all weak."" Reverse Flash clones himself into 10 versions, with each one attacking Bizarro, who is overwhelmed and unable to move. Reverse Flash then does the same thing he did to kill Spider-Man. Meanwhile, Matt, watching from afar, becomes fearful and hateful of Thawn, plotting how to bring him down.

Reverse Flash, smarter than the others, whispers in Thor's ear, instructing him to kill Matt now. Thor smashes Matt's skull, and he says, ""No‚Ä¶ no, impossible... What have I done?"" Reed Richards hears this and orders Thawn to imprison Thor in a place he had created for him. After imprisoning Thor, Thawn, in the darkness, says, ""The plan is working. These heroes are idiots. They‚Äôre dwindling down; three are dead in two weeks. But I want it to be faster."" At 3 AM, Thawn heads to the Avengers' headquarters and fires his gun, missing. The first to arrive is Reed Richards, but when he finds no one in the building, Thawn kills him and dumps his body in the sea.

The scene shifts to the next morning, where Thawn is sipping coffee in Thor‚Äôs prison, saying, ""Oh, Thor, you know you and your team are trash. I killed them one by one in a single night... In fact, I enjoyed it, especially your dumb green friend. I punched him three million times in less than a second and left him in the sea. And do you know what else? After I killed that idiot werewolf with claws, I phased him into the sea, attaching a powerful magnet to make sure they would stay stuck there until death.""

Thor, sad and angry, vows to kill Thawn one day. Thawn answers with mockery, ""Believe me, you're not even close to the weakest I've faced in my world.""

A year has passed since Thawn arrived on my planet. He killed all my friends, massacred people in the streets, and raised an army to harass a guy named Flash. What a pathetic, obsessed, lifeless person. How can I escape here? How can I stop him from using my ring? Is there anyone still alive besides me?

Meanwhile, Reverse Flash continues to torture Thor daily in the most grotesque ways, even creating over 20 copies of himself to find ways to make things capable of withstanding him. He says, ""I always dreamed of doing this with Superman, but this is better than nothing.""

Since then I've had indigestion, bloating, cramps, nausea. Eating healthy doesn't make a difference. I could feel nauseous eating a salad. Nothing feels the same anymore. I try to go eat out and have fun but I'm always thinking about my stomach. Last night I tried to enjoy a night out and had some alcohol, today I've had burning in my throat and stomach so that's great, now I probably also have GERD or gastritis. The one thing I really enjoy having everyday which never even bothered my ibs, coffee, will probably have to go now too if I have gastritis :( What does it matter, it's just a new symptom everyday. Now I'm stressed over having a new condition which will of course make me sicker. Will this miserable cycle ever end? 

I even had my anxiety under control but now that my body is messed up, it's harder and harder to control it. Doctors don't care or have answers. Eating healthy doesn't help.

today i worked and then went to the pub with some friends. much more productive than i usually am- i feel the pressure of being young. being young whilst also being aware of how short of a time ‚Äòbeing young‚Äô is makes for an anxious existence. recently i lost my mother, who was my link to the rest of my family. now that she‚Äôs gone it feels like i have lost most of my family with her. i never made strong, trusting relationships with anyone in my family outside of my mother in childhood. so i was essentially attached to the him. i didn‚Äôt feel safe unless she was there. and now that is all gone with nothing to replace it.

commuting to work is hard. work is draining. all i do is talk to strangers on the phone. all i do is sit at my desk and get up and make a coffee and sit at my desk and go to the toilet and sit at my desk. 

right now i am smoking in the bathroom
right now i am listening to track 4 by directions ",1,1745276669.0,u_jaggy-snakes,0,0.99,False

#The PSE gained 3 points to 6138 ‚ñ≤0.1%

I got really distracted this morning by watching the DOW crumble and doom-watching financial analysis on my second screen. 

Let's see how the PSE consumes the continued meltdown of the American markets when it opens. Just a few hours away. While I hold my positions for many months/years, it's still unnerving to see one of the most integrated financial markets implode. I can't help but brace for impact.

This feels like it's going to be a 4-coffee morning.

#‚ñåMain stories covered:

>- **[EARNINGS]  BPI Q1 profit: ‚Ç±16.6-B (up 9% y/y)...** **BPI** [BPI 135.10 ‚ñ≤2.4%; 58% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=779a6859b864d2dfec6e1601ccee8f59)] reported ‚Ç±16.6 billion in Q1 net income, up 9% y/y from the ‚Ç±15.3 billion it booked in Q1/24, and up 18.3% q/q from its Q4/24 performance. Q1 revenues were up 13.1% y/y to ‚Ç±44.7 billion, with net interest income up 15.3% and non-interest income up 6.3% (higher credit card fees and other transaction fees). BPI saw its operating expenses increase by 12.7% to ‚Ç±20.3 billion, which it attributed to spending on ‚Äúmanpower, technology, and business volume-related expenses.‚Äù
>    - ***MB:*** Just in case you were worried about how the banks are navigating these uncertain times. Well, guess what? They‚Äôre doing great. Our banks (as a whole) have never been so profitable. While BPI‚Äôs stock price recovery from the COVID cash in 2020 has been almost a straight-line up and to the right when zoomed out, like all things in life, the path is not quite so straight the closer you look. Take BPI‚Äôs last 6 months of stock price performance for example. The stock was trading up in the ‚Ç±140/share range in October/November of 2024, but by January 2025, the stock was languishing in the ‚Ç±118/share range. That‚Äôs an 18% drop over a two month span, which is considerable for a bank that is as large and foundational as BPI; luckily for shareholders, the drop setup a nice and quick 19% recovery from February to mid-March.

>- **[UPDATE]  WTF is happening now?...** Your daily review of what happened since the last time we talked.

>  **Trade war:**  Reports coming out of the US-Japan trade negotiations were not promising, with the Japanese delegation pulling out of talks before coming to an agreement. 

>  **DOW:**  As of this writing (midnight), the US markets are getting absolutely hammered. The DOW is down 2.7% (1,050 points) to 38,085 and the NASDAQ is doing even worse in the first day of trading after the Easter long weekend. EDIT: The DOW is down 1250 points now.

>  **Gold:**  Up almost 3% ($100/ounce) to $3,412. Is this a flight-to-safety from American assets after Trump threatened the US Federal Reserve‚Äôs independence? 

>  **US Dollar:**  The US Dollar continues to slide versus other major currencies--like the Euro--and there‚Äôs a big increase in the number of stories wondering aloud whether the US Dollar is ‚Äúat risk of a confidence crisis?‚Äù 

>    - ***MB:*** More financial chaos, and more signals that the US lacks a central strategy in this high-stakes game that it‚Äôs playing. Internationally, the world is pulling back from the US in ways that are immediate (cancelling travel plans, boycotting goods) and long-term, and the rhetoric coming from the US and China is clearly setting up another Cold War-like world order, organized by allegiance to one of the two powers. The tit-for-tat economic war rages on.

>- **[QUESTION]  Should I buy gold or gold stocks?...** When the price of gold rises, it‚Äôs inevitable for investors to try and find ways to monetize the movement of money into gold. It‚Äôs just as inevitable for investors to get freaked out by the process of buying physical gold (whether in bars or coins), and then double freaked out by the prospect of buying a gold mining stock or two as a suitable replacement. Which is better to do? It‚Äôs situation-specific.

>  **Physical gold:**  For me, I like to own physical gold. I‚Äôve been buying physical gold since 2005. My first 1-ounce coin cost me $450. But I didn‚Äôt know how to buy gold in those days. I went to gold shops in places that were unsafe. I bought way more gold than I needed, and I didn‚Äôt have a good plan for how to store or protect what I bought. Now, I store my gold in a safety deposit box, and I have the process of buying gold down to a science. But the one hitch in my plan is that I‚Äôve never actually sold gold before. While I have an idea of how to sell my gold, I‚Äôve never gone through the process of trying to sell it back to a bullion dealer or finding a buyer on the open market. There are risks there that I simply haven‚Äôt addressed.

>  **Gold stocks:**  The thinking here is to put money into companies with significant inventories of gold or that hold significant gold mining rights. Naturally, there isn‚Äôt a straight-line relationship between the price of gold and the value of the gold stocks that you can buy, since each gold stock is nerfed and boosted by its own set of circumstances. I‚Äôve owned gold stocks that simply refused to sell gold during a pump. I‚Äôve owned gold stocks that used the pump to sell a follow-on offering. I‚Äôve owned gold stocks that used the pump to go on a mergers and acquisitions spree. Objectively, the mining industry is not investor-friendly, but I find that the more regulated the gold stock, the more aligned the investors‚Äô best interests tend to be with those who own the company and the government that taxes their income. At the end of the day, the prime benefit of owning gold stocks is liquidity. It‚Äôs way easier to get in and out of your position.

>    - ***MB:*** We don‚Äôt have a lot of options on the PSE for investing in gold. Americans have gold mining stocks and a long list of ETFs that allow investors to make very exotic bets on the price movement of gold. We don‚Äôt have that. We have **Apex Mining** [APX 6.95 ‚ñ≤10.3%; 169% avgVol], **OceanaGold PH** [OGP 16.40 ‚ñ≤2.4%; 156% avgVol], and **Philex Mining** [PX 7.00 ‚ñ≤1.0%; 79% avgVol], plus a collection of smaller miners and companies that produce gold as a secondary resource to their primary course of business. Of those, APX has already experienced a 120% surge in its stock price, PX is more of an exploratory bet, and OGP is a dividend play with gold price appreciation upside. Leaving aside what could happen with the price of gold as this economic crisis evolves (whether it skyrockets or tanks), whenever I‚Äôm thinking about buying gold, I‚Äôm not usually thinking about making a high-risk bet on what could be: I‚Äôm playing defense. I‚Äôm trying to secure my money and protect my portfolio from wild swings or from specific risks like inflation. That‚Äôs why I prefer OGP, but not as a way to play the price of gold specifically, but as a way to potentially gain from the movement of gold‚Äôs price as a sweetener over and above what the company already produces in the way of dividends. Of course, the calculation of whether it‚Äôs worth putting money into OGP at these price points is one that depends on several assumptions that I‚Äôm not willing to make on your behalf. What will the price of gold be through FY25 and beyond? What will happen with interest rates? How much gold will OGP produce compared to last year? The current price represents a loose approximation of a lot of these assumptions, so as any of those metrics fluctuate, the price will also fluctuate. OGP isn‚Äôt a gold price pass-through, but it does approximate the shape of gold‚Äôs price trends.

She's been joining classes at the senior centre at Fairfield, but hasn't made any lasting connections unfortunately. She would love to make friends with another elderly woman who would like to join her for walks, grabbing coffee, or going to the senior centre to play some ping pong.

Edit: Including some details about my mom. In her early 80's, East Asian immigrant, used to run her own small business, has no issues with carrying English conversations, has issues with short term memory now, but is still friendly.

1k4rbv0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k4rbv0,I really need some advice,"Hey guys, so ive been diagnosed with Hypothyroidism.
I deal with a lot of health issues, but this one in particular is really beating me up. I was started on Levothyroxine 75mcg to start, everything was fine till about the 5th week taking it when my hair starting shedding.
I went at the 6 week mark to re test and see how things were going. Brought up the hairloss to the nurse since it was just a blood draw, she notified my dr. 
Now since ive started my 100mcg dose, yall, it has been IMPOSSSSSSIBLE to wake up in the mornings. I even went to bed at a good time last night. 10:30, and still couldnt wake up at 8am to get to work on time. I woke up to my alarm today, got up, barely remember brushing my teeth, starting the coffee, even forgot i put on deodorant. Ended up passing back out on my couch while waiting for my coffee to brew. My adhd meds thankfully kicked in after a while and i was coherent and made it to work. Late, thankfully i work with my mom and she was understanding. Heres messages between me, the nurse, and my doctor. I have an appointment tomorrow regarding this sleep issue which i put a screenshot of what exactlys going on.
Will this get better? Should i try to ask for a different medication? Also put what my levels were when it was just recently drawn.
Im new to this, i have no idea whats going on. He suggested if i wanted to stop the medication i could, and i had done it for like 5 days and then realized I shouldn‚Äôt stop cold turkey due to the effects it was giving me. It was awful. Im at a loss. I dont want to lose my hair, but i also dont want to keep feeling like crap.

I just found out that I don't have a direct connection between my pc and my ""home server"" (actually just an old pc that I use to run qbittorrent, a ftp server, and a jellyfin server), I tried reading [these tips](https://tailscale.com/kb/1082/firewall-ports) to improve the speed of the connection since I was having problems streaming a movie. My home server has a public ip while my pc is behind cgnat (4g connection).

As a newbie to tailscale and definitely not a network expert I don't really understand them. I just tried this one:

* Let your internal devices initiate UDP¬†**from**¬†`:41641`¬†to¬†`*:*`.Direct WireGuard tunnels use UDP with source port 41641. We recommend¬†`*:*`¬†because you cannot possibly predict every guest Wi-fi, coffee shop, LTE provider, or hotel network that your users may be using.

Does this mean I have to open port 41641 on my router setting as ip the one my machine? I am afraid this could be dangerous (I use tailscale exactly to avoid opening ports on my router to reach my services).

Btw after this I restarted tailscale on both machines and could establish direct connection, but I guess it could just be a coincidence.",2,1745276422.0,Tailscale,8,1.0,False
