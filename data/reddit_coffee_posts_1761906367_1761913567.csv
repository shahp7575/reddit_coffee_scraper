What are you going to pick? Jokes at the ready or perhaps you’ll be more interested in a treat?

Anyway once you pick, here’s some more details about me:

Looking for a captivating distraction, someone to get delightfully lost in, whether it’s for a day, a season, or however long the spark lasts.

About me: I’m 31, Scottish, 5’11”, and powered by laughter, caffeine, and a healthy dose of mischief. You’ll usually find me in the gym, up a mountain, camping under the stars, or hunting down hidden coffee spots, bars, and restaurants. I’ve got a serious case of wanderlust too — always planning my next adventure (bonus points if you’ve got a passport and a playful spirit).

Here’s the deal:

- Conventionally attractive (so I’ve been told), athletic, and usually dressed like I’ve got somewhere better to be — but I’d rather be with someone who makes me forget where that was.

- I’m a great chef — I can make you breakfast, dinner, or something that’ll make you stay for both.

- I’m sporty and competitive, both on and off the field… and let’s just say my stamina isn’t limited to the gym.

- I’m all about chemistry, connection, and seeing where things go — casual fun with the potential for more, if the vibes align.

So… Trick or Treat?

1oksx40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oksx40/my_22f_close_friend_21m_is_affectionate_but/,"My (22F) close friend (21M) is affectionate but inconsistent, does he like me or am I imagining it? How do I proceed? TLDR at the bottom.","For context, I (22F) met this guy (21M) through a game with voice chat roughly 3-4 months ago, and at first we were just being very casual and ended up becoming part of the same friend group. But, then it got a bit complicated. We started getting closer after some drama with my then on-and-off boyfriend, now ex, whom I'd been having trouble with for quite some time. My ex got really insecure and accused this friend of trying to “steal me,” even though nothing was going on. It was messy, but during that time, me and this male friend kept talking as friends and grew closer due to the drama. He was supportive, funny, and easy to be around and kept my mind off the downfall of a very chaotic relationship. Eventually, I ended my relationship in part because of my ex’s jealousy. I do feel the need to preface that back then, I genuinely saw this friend as just a new online friend, nothing more.

Since then, though, we’ve gotten a lot closer. We tease each other constantly, talk for hours, and have stayed up all night together more than I can count. Our dynamic is a bit weird, we have this very playful relationship where we ""pretend-fight"" and get on each others nerves constantly, which I do enjoy but it does make it difficult to tell exactly where we stand sometimes. The banter is fun, but lately it’s felt like there’s something more under the surface.

When he drinks, he gets soft and affectionate. He’ll say my name over and over, and repeatedly call the only other girl in our friend group my name by mistake. Everyone jokes about it, playfully saying stuff as if I'm always on his mind, but it makes me wonder a bit. And when he struggles to find the correct words whilst drunk he'll always ask me to help him as if I'd be able to read his mind.

There's also an instance where, when he was drunk, he said I'm secretly his favourite in our group and asked me to sleep-call with him, which I did end up doing. The next day when he woke up we spent the entire day talking and said we should keep the sleep-call secret, yet he ended up getting drunk that following night and out of nowhere repeatedly revealed it to our friends and said I was the one who wanted to keep it secret.

A few weeks later, I went to visit him in his city which was our first time ever actually meeting up. I met his dad, we went out for coffee and dinner, and it honestly felt so natural. He's joked that the next time I should stay the night in his bed with him even though it's very small and said something like “we’d fit somehow.”

Quite some time later, we planned the first group meet-up for everyone within our friend group. He playfully refused to take the train and wanted me to pick him up and drive him there, and we ended up sharing a hotel room and bed. He can be physically affectionate sometimes, and I can’t always tell if it’s just friendly or something more. That night for example, he put his hand in my jacket pocket to warm it when we were out with the rest of our friends, and when going to bed he said I could “hold him if I wanted to spoon"" although I genuinely couldn't tell if he was joking or not, because directly before saying that and getting in bed he'd joked about sleeping naked. During the night, he occasionally shifted close to me, with his arm brushing against me and sometimes close enough that he was fully on my side of the bed and almost holding me.

But, the most confusing thing for me is what happened the next morning. He invited the only other girl from our group, that I mentioned before, into our room and cuddled with her right next to me. At one point he reached across her, brushed my shoulder, and played with my bra strap whilst joking around. Then, out of nowhere, he lightly put his hand near my neck and asked why I wasn’t joining them and cuddling. It wasn’t aggressive or anything, I wasn’t sure how to read it and didn’t quite know what to do in the moment as I don't really even get along with this girl for unrelated reasons.  
Afterward, he went back to joking like nothing happened and even called me his “best friend” later that day. Since then, he’s been really inconsistent, like one moment he's being warm and flirty, and the next he feels very distant. He tells people about our late-night calls and that we’ve “fallen asleep on the phone together” for no reason, but then spends most of his time gaming or chatting with that other girl instead and will very rarely reach out to me. (Though I do think its somewhat unfair to judge him for not reaching out, because I don't reach out much either at this point, due to not knowing how to handle this whole situation). But he'll also make playful comments regarding this other girl and another guy in our friend group, because she's supposedly into that guy. Yet a part of me can't help but think there's something between her and M21, especially after the hotel situation.

The thing is, I find myself really liking him now. I don't know why, but it's to the point where it's more than I'd like to admit. I can see myself falling for him, but I can’t tell if he feels the same or if this is just how he is with people he’s close to. Part of me wonders if he’s just playing around, but then he does things that make me think he genuinely cares. I also feel insecure sometimes because I’m plus-size and not conventionally attractive compared to him.

We have another trip planned, with another guy who's part of our friend group and that guy's girlfriend. At a quite romantic destination which adds to my confusion. He's joked about it being a double date to our other male friend who's going on the trip. The plan is to share a hotel room again. I don’t want to make things weird or ruin the friendship, but I also don’t want to keep feeling this uncertain and hurt. I don’t think he’s a bad guy, I just think we've both somewhat blurred the lines between friendship and something more without meaning to. I care about him and want to understand where we stand so I don’t keep overthinking everything. Like, I can't tell if he's just being flirty for fun? Do I talk to him about it? Start pulling back to protect myself?

**TL;DR**: I (22F) met a guy (21M) through a game a few months ago and we became close friends. We have a playful, sometimes flirty dynamic, share late-night calls, and have stayed in the same hotel room. He can be affectionate but inconsistent, and recently included another girl in ways that confused me. I like him, but I don’t know if he feels the same or if I’m misreading things. We have another trip planned with a hotel stay at a romantic location, and I’m unsure whether to talk to him about it or pull back to protect myself.",1,1761912859.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

*From “MY Fantasy Life” (cred Eigenstien)*

*Happy Halloween to all!*

*Today is “RV Park meet Longhouse School”! Our Longhouse kids will go trick-or-treating to the RVs.*

*During Community Service each morning, some of our children volunteer in the Rec Room during Coffee Hour. We all worked out a plan: the kids will all travel with their packs of site vocabulary (younger readers) or spelling words (more advanced readers). They knock on an RV door, present their deck, the client chooses a card, and the child gets a treat for reading or spelling its word (or coming close). I don't know who is more excited: the clients or the children!*

*Artie and I are pretty much confined to the Office or Rec Room all day (besides the daily escape to Costco or Starbucks for one of us). But it is amazing what we learn from just looking out the window or standing on the porch. Despite the weather, the techs from the Patio/Hearth company came. The vertical poles for the pizza oven setup were now secure in the ground and his watched has the workers started to construct the framework for the pizza oven.*


*We get more news about the day from Lori during dinner. “What do you think?” she asked us. “Does concrete expand or contract when it dries?” We played along with her game with IDK answers. Very proudly she answered, “It contracts!” she informed us, clenching her fist. “It's called shrinkage. That’s what makes the vertical foundation pole sit so tightly!”*

*This is Lori speaking so she was certainly not finished. “There are three types of shrinkage. First comes the ‘plastic shrinkage’ at the surface caused by evaporation.” For whatever reason, the Twinettes found the word shrinkage to be very funny and they giggled each time they heard it. Not to be thrown from her horse by three-year-olds, Lori continued, “Then comes ‘drying shrinkage’ from  below the surface that can take many months to dry and keeps squeezing the concrete into the post. Then comes ‘thermal shrinkage.’ Did you know that concrete gets warmer when its ingredients are mixed together? It contracts even more when it cools down!” No, I didn’t know that.*

*She mentioned that the kids got all wet from watching the workers. “We didn't mind. Our ancestors had to do all sorts of work in the rain. We are simply ‘Ram Tough!’”*

*Thursday is “Words Day,” and at their weekly School Meeting, the kids asked their teachers whether we could purchase rain gear for them. Ram tough or not. Over dinner, I promised to buy sets at Costco's today.*

*Lori talked about Dee’s early morning lesson about sewing ponchos for all of the kids. She flipped about words as if she had invented them: ""patterns,"" ""basting stitches,"" and 'running stitches."" She told us that Dei was their model and tried on the poncho. Dee is making alterations to it and to the pattern. ""We will be sewing them ourselves by hand!” Dee was beaming.*

*Lori also told us how much she loves listening to this week's music selection, Ode to Joy. “Each day we keep telling Teacher Lolita to start it a little bit earlier and to play it a little bit longer. Did you know that this song is the national anthem for Europe?” No, I didn't know that either. And I saw Guy and Lolita beaming around the table.*

*Eulogio leaves tomorrow for his monthly Managers Meeting and on Sunday he will attend Kosen-rufu Gongyo at the NYCC. On Monday I plan on starting to study the November installment of Daisaku Ikeda’s lecture on “The Opening of the Eyes.” So this gives me 3 days to review the October 17th World Tribune.* 

[With the Courage of a Lion’s Roar, Let Us Strive Eternally With Ikeda Sensei](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/with-the-courage-of-a-lions-roar-let-us-strive-eternally-with-ikeda-sensei/) is the speech President Harada gave at the September HQ General Meeting and Youth Training Course in Tokyo.

>While in Malaysia, I had the honor of delivering a lecture on Sensei’s philosophy of humanism at the invitation of the International Institute of Islamic Thought and Civilisation, part of the International Islamic University Malaya (ISTAC-IIUM).

Pres. Harada tells us that the preparations for this lecture started about a year and a half ago when he met with Dr. Osman Bakar and associates. The University wanted to host an SGI exhibition on the Lotus Sutra,. “The Lotus Sutra—A Message of Peace and Harmonious Coexistence” took place about a year ago and subsequently led to his visit and lecture this past August.

Professor Bakar, an eminent Islamic philosopher, had encountered the dialogue *Choose Life* between Daisaku Ikeda and historian Arnold J. Toynbee while he was studying in the U.K. “He was deeply struck by Sensei’s intellect and profound philosophy,” Pres. Harada mentioned.  

Pres. Harada skips backward to Daisaku Ikeda’s visit to Malaysia in 1988 when he had a meeting with the late Vice Chancellor Ungku Abdul Aziz of the University of Malaya.  

At the lecture, Mr. Koh Sia Feai, general director of Soka Gakkai Malaysia, expressed his appreciation to all attendees. Pres. Harada noted that Mr. Koh “has personally experienced the varied challenges of advancing kosen-rufu within an Islamic society.”

>Looking back on the path that led to this moment, one cannot help but sense that seeds Sensei sowed decades ago through his tireless efforts in diplomacy and dialogue with other cultures and religions are now bearing remarkable fruit.

So, that's how World Peace advances, one tiny step at a time, often unrecognized! Pres. Harada  mentioned Prof. Ichiro Sugimoto, who is now dean of the Faculty of International Liberal Arts at Soka University. A few mans after Sensei’s visit, Sugimoto became an international student at the University of Malaya where he was mentored by  Professors Bakar and Aziz.

>Whenever the chance presented itself, the young Mr. Sugimoto would share with them his admiration for Sensei and the Soka Gakkai....When misunderstandings and unfounded criticisms of the Soka Gakkai or Soka University surfaced on campus, [Dr. Bakar] would step forward to correct the misconceptions—often citing passages from the Toynbee–Ikeda dialogue to convey Sensei’s character and the true nature of the Soka Gakkai, as well as to stand in defense of Mr. Sugimoto. Through this personal connection, Professor Bakar’s understanding of the Soka movement deepened. At Mr. Sugimoto’s invitation, he even visited Soka University in the late 1990s.

Yes, the advance of world peace starts with friendships. On Tuesday comes the Town vote on the initiative to fund the prospective Gym/Indoor Pool/Skating Pavilion. This entire effort is the result of many friendships. Guy built friendships Guy in the school district, with local pastors, and also veterans and other neighbors dealing with post-traumatic stress. Eulogio built friendships with the business community and Dee with the local Ukrainian community center. I have my friends with the Hockey Moms. Friendships count!

>What began as a mentor’s warm support for a young student has since developed into a meaningful and ongoing exchange with Soka Gakkai Malaysia—an exchange that continues vibrantly to this day.

>Professor Bakar once expressed his high hopes for the Soka Gakkai: “My message to all the members is to go ahead with confidence, with sincerity that you are serving humanity. … Our world needs more of this kind of individual.”

In contrast, BlancheFromage talks about “More examples of SGI members’ rank intolerance, religious bigotry, hatefulness, and ‘Up YOURS, Interfaith!’” Of course, how can Blanche ever be wrong with all of her colorful indignation, the Source of Pure Truth? She has ever-ready her version of the fierce battle of words (1990-1991) I've heard so much about from my sponsors, between the SGI and NST to clarify the true intent of Nichiren’s teachings.

During approximately that same time span, with Dr. Ikeda’s 1988 visit to Malaysia, I see a very different perspective: the emerging interchange between Buddhism and Islam starting with personal diplomacy, and many years later manifesting in the form of exhibitions on the Lotus Sutra, and university and institution-based lectures.

Weigh the evidence on a universal scale. Which perspective carries more significance and weight?

Pres. Harada:

Miss Z is an adult female cat who isn't cuddly, thank God. The beginning was rocky, I never had a cat and I have to sleep with a closed door. I lost it when she tried clawing her way into the bedroom. In the beginning I was a bit aggressive. I felt bad, though. 

I usually don't feel as bad with people, but I knew that she didn't have malicious intent and that I don't know how to explain to her why I need a closed door. 

Then we got to know eachother and things got better. She follows me around (let me pee in peace please), she rolls on the floor when I step out of the room and when I enter the apartment. She headbutts my feet, shows me her bum (cats, yeah...), slow blinks, etc. 

I don't have a strong attachment, which further taught me about myself, but it's nice to have someone who simply doesn't judge. Oh, you had a bad day? People were mean? You don't have a job? Doesn't matter, as long the litter box is clean, there's water and food, snacks, pets and she can watch me brush my teeth. 

I gave her catnip once and freaked out that I accidentally gave her something else and she might die. She's fine, I'm neurotic. I grew to welcome her gestures and the fact that she isn't a velcro cat (I wouldn't be able to handle it) and a smart creature. 

But overall, when I read about people loving pets, I understand that it isn't for me. Plus, I get meltdowns when she yowls when I try to sleep. I do try to show my gratitude for her behaviour with slow blinks, snacks, getting up and petting her before I had coffee, talking to her, giving her toys, petting her and giving her space. I still spray her with water when she wakes me up at night (grumpy and impulsive, that's me), but I am trying. 

Next week I am leaving, hopefully I will have a lease. We'll never see eachother again, but she'll be fine. 

I like cats now, well, at least this one and I can admit that I am a plant person, they're just... More suitable. But I might foster for a short while in the future if stable enough. I'm now converted and appreciate cats, before I didn't really get the hype.

1oksmjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chi_FI_Gadgets/comments/1oksmjo/simgot_supermix_4_on_iphone_is_the_apple_dongle/,SIMGOT SuperMix 4 on iPhone — Is the Apple Dongle Enough for EDM & Piano,"
#### SIMGOT SuperMix 4 on iPhone — Is the Apple Dongle Enough for EDM & Piano?

I’ve been living with the 'SIMGOT SuperMix 4' for a bit, swapping between morning coffee playlists (Debussy, Satie) and late-night bass therapy (Illenium, Seven Lions). My chain most days is dead simple: iPhone → Apple dongle → SuperMix 4. The big question I wanted to settle: 'is the Apple dongle actually sufficient' for this IEM, or do you need to chase a beefier DAC/amp? For context, the SuperMix 4 is a quad-hybrid with 1DD + 1BA + 1 planar + 1 PZT, rated around '7.2Ω' and '120 dB/Vrms'—that’s very easy to drive and also quite revealing.

Short answer: with the right settings, the Apple dongle is shockingly capable for portable listening—especially with low-impedance, high-sensitivity IEMs like the SuperMix 4. Measurements show the Apple adapters run up to '24-bit/48 kHz', with 'low output impedance (~0.9Ω)' and up to about '1 Vrms' on the US models. Translation: clean, transparent, and enough voltage for most IEMs. What you give up is 'hi-res' beyond 48 kHz and higher power headroom.

There’s also a quirk: some regions have a volume-capped variant (historically ~0.5 Vrms). If your unit feels oddly quiet versus everyone else’s, check the model—enthusiast reports list 'A2049' (US) as ~1 Vrms and certain EU variants lower. Not a deal-breaker for IEMs, but worth knowing.

On the IEM side, the SuperMix 4’s low impedance can be sensitive to source output impedance. The Apple dongle’s output impedance is very low, so 'tonal shifts are minimal'—a good pairing for consistent FR. With EDM, sub-bass punch is there; for piano, transients stay crisp and clean. If you’re hearing haze or shout, it’s usually _settings_ or _tips/seal_ before it’s the dongle.

#### Before you upgrade the dongle, fix the phone

'1) Turn on Lossless in Apple Music': _Settings → Music → Audio Quality → Lossless_. If you already downloaded tracks, remove and redownload to get lossless versions. This alone often makes the system 'snap' into focus.

'2) Kill hidden processing': ensure _Music → EQ = Off_, and check _Headphone Accommodations_ are neutral unless you intend to use them. If you use _Reduce Loud Sounds_, remember it applies dynamic compression—fine for safety, but it can change perceived impact.

'3) Seal and tips': swap tips until you get a perfect seal (no bass leak when you gently press and release). With the SuperMix 4, I get the best EDM slam with a slightly stiffer silicone that holds its shape; foams warm the mids for piano but can blur micro-detail. (Tip rolling is free performance.)

#### When a dongle upgrade really helps

If you want 'more headroom', 'PEQ/EQ control', or you listen loudly to modern EDM with heavy limiting, a better dongle/BT-DAC can be worth it.

'• Qudelix 5K' — My favorite 'all-terrain' pick for iPhone. It gives you wired or Bluetooth, hardware PEQ with a great app, and far more output power than the Apple dongle. For iOS users, it’s a rare path to 'system-wide parametric EQ' without funky workarounds. I keep a subtle +3 dB shelf at 60 Hz for EDM nights, a gentle -1.5 dB around 3 kHz for brighter masters, and a +1 dB 'air' band around 8–10 kHz for solo piano. The device measures well and the community documentation is excellent.

'• Fresh tiny USB-C options' — If you’re on an iPhone 15 (USB-C) and want to stay ultra-compact/budget, recent releases like FiiO’s _Snowsky Tiny_ put 32-bit/384 kHz PCM support in a thumb-sized stick. Don’t buy it for 'hi-res bragging rights,' buy it for the combo of 'slightly higher output' and convenience (one version even charges your phone while you listen).

'Compatibility note': a few ultra-hot dongles (e.g., some E1DA models) have had iOS compatibility wrinkles reported around major iOS updates. If you go the 'max power' route, skim user threads first to avoid surprises.

#### My quick tuning cheats for SuperMix 4 (EDM & Piano)

For 'EDM', I like a '+2–3 dB low-shelf @ 60 Hz', Q ~0.7, and a tiny '-1 dB @ ~3 kHz' if vocals get shouty at party volumes. For 'piano', I nudge a '+0.5 to +1 dB @ 8–10 kHz' for air and leave bass flat. If you grab the Qudelix, you can import AutoEQ targets and then tweak by ear—super fast.

#### What about 'hi-res'?

The Apple dongles top out at '24/48'. You’ll need an external DAC to play >48 kHz sample rates natively on iPhone/iPad. In practice, the mastering matters more; I’d prioritize EQ, seal, and volume headroom before chasing hi-res numbers.

#### Related gear I’d reach for next (Chi-Fi first)

If you want alternate flavors in the same portable spirit, I’d start with the brands that consistently punch above their price on phones and dongles: 'MOONDROP, TRUTHEAR, SIMGOT, 7Hz, LETSHUOER, THIEAUDIO, DUNU, KZ, Kiwi Ears, AFUL'. If you prefer to browse a curated collection with support, here’s a good jumping-off point: ['DANKUNG Earphones'](https://www.dankung.com/taxonomy/category-earphones_185?cp=dk10forum).

#### How the SuperMix 4 actually sounds to me here

With the Apple dongle, the SuperMix 4 is fast, a bit 'spotlighted' on details, and snappy on transients—great for arps and piano hammers. Kick hits are clean more than thick; a 2 dB shelf fixes that for club tracks without muddying the mids. What surprised me is how well the imaging holds up on a phone chain; positional cues stay intact on complex synth layers. Spec-wise, this makes sense: the IEM is easy to drive and the dongle stays linear at normal listening levels.

#### Video: a closer listen to SuperMix 4

'Watch:' The Power of 4 | Simgot Supermix 4 Review!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB2B_NvJ140

_

#### If you want to go deeper (power + PEQ): my pocket stack

Most days I keep the chain minimal, but when I want that extra slam and surgical PEQ, the 'Qudelix 5K' comes out. It’s tiny, clips to a shirt pocket, and turns the iPhone into a reference-friendly rig with full control. For commuting, I’ll even go wireless with it and the SuperMix 4 still sounds coherent—no drama, just music.

#### Bottom line

If you’ve got the SuperMix 4 and a US Apple dongle, you already have a 'credible' portable setup for EDM and piano. Dial in Apple Music Lossless, check your seal, try a tiny low-shelf, and enjoy. If you crave more headroom and tool-level EQ, add a compact DAC like the Qudelix. The theme here is simple: start clean, tweak smart, and let the music do the flexing.

In my first year of law school, I was really close to this girl. We hung out every day, and her mom owned a local café that we went to after class. Her mom was a saint who always fed us and gave us endless free coffee.

Before starting law school, I had just broken up with a long term ex and went through a short lived “hoe phase.” I posted a bunch of bikini pictures, including one that showed my ass. It went somewhat viral the way thirst traps sometimes do, and it got the kind of attention you do not really want.

My friend noticed. She even saw that her ex was liking my posts and checking my stories. I did not know who he was, and I never replied to his DMs. Later, I found out that she had been talking badly about me to him and to our mutual friends. Naturally, we drifted apart and were not close during our second year.

She, on the other hand, started posting the same kind of picture that had once gone viral on my account. The exact same pose, just in different places, over and over again.

1oksh3x,https://i.redd.it/6xt9ow8grfyf1.png,The 60-Day Reset: How to Transform Your Life Before 2026,"It was a [Tuesday afternoon in March 2025](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb), sitting in my corner office [overlooking downtown Mumbai](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb), when my hands started shaking so badly I couldn’t hold my coffee cup. My assistant knocked —[ another “urgent” client call](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) — and I heard myself say something I’d never said before: “[Tell them I’m unavailable.](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb)”

I was 32, a senior marketing director [at one of India’s top agencies](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb), earning more than I’d ever imagined, and absolutely miserable. The [breakup that shattered me in January](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) was just the beginning. By February, I’d discovered [my closest friend had been talking about me behind](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) my back for months. By March, I was having [panic attacks in my bathroom and crying during my commute home](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb).

I’m not here to tell you to quit your job like I eventually did. [That’s not everyone’s answer, and it certainly wasn’t an easy one](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). But I am here to tell you [that with 60 days left in 2025](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb), you have a precious window — [a sacred pause before the calendar flips](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) — to reclaim yourself. Not the polished version [you show the world, but the real, messy, magnificently human](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) version that’s been buried under [expectations, disappointments, and the relentless pace](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) of just surviving.

# The Wake-Up Call I Didn’t Know I Needed

[My therapist asked me a question in April](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) that changed everything: “[When was the last time you felt like yourself?](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb)” I couldn’t answer. I genuinely couldn’t remember. The person I’d become, [constantly available, perpetually exhausted](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb), saying yes when I meant no, staying in [relationships that drained me, wasn’t me at al](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb)l. She was a [collection of coping mechanisms](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) wrapped in expensive clothes and fake smiles.

The [months that followed weren’t about grand transformations](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) or Instagram-worthy breakthroughs. They were about small, sometimes painful, [often beautiful moments of coming back to life](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). My personal [transformation journey included everything — therapy, meditation apps, journaling, even a tarot reading](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) that helped me see patterns I’d been blind to. Some things worked. Some didn’t. [But slowly, I found my way back](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb).

# Week 1–2: The Truth-Telling Phase

[**Get brutally honest about what’s actually wrong**](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb)**.**

I started by making a list, [not a gratitude journal or vision board](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb), but a raw inventory of everything that hurt. This kind of [end-of-year reflection isn’t comfortable](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb), but it’s necessary.

What I discovered:

* [My relationship had ended because I’d ignored red flags](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) for two years, choosing potential over reality
* My friendships had [deteriorated because I’d been too busy climbing ladders to notice](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) who was actually standing beside me
* [My health was suffering](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) because I’d treated my body like a machine that just needed coffee to keep running

This isn’t about wallowing. It’s about[ finally being honest enough to change something](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). [Healing from burnout starts with admitting](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) you’re burned out.

**Action step:** Spend 30 minutes writing without filter. What hurts? [What are you pretending is fine?](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) What have you been too scared or tired to face? Don’t edit. [Don’t make it pretty. Just tell the truth](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb).

# Week 3–4: The Grief Work Nobody Talks About

**Allow yourself to mourn what’s gone.**

Here’s what [nobody tells you about the emotional healing journey](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb): you have to grieve. Not just [relationships that ended, but the version of yourself](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) that didn’t work out. The life you thought you’d have by now. The [friendships that faded](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). The dreams that [died quietly while you were busy surviving.](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb)

I spent weeks [crying, in the shower, during meditation](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb), while watching sunset from my tiny balcony. At first, I was ashamed. [But grief isn’t weakness](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). It’s your heart making space for something new. Healing after a breakup, [or any major loss requires this kind of honest emotional processing](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb).

**Action step:** Create a simple ritual for letting go. Light a candle. Write a letter to what you’re releasing — [a relationship, a version of yourself, an expectation](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). Read it aloud, then burn it safely or tear it up. [Let yourself feel whatever comes up](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb).

# Week 5–6: Rediscovering Stillness and Joy

**Find your version of meditation for healing.**

[I’d tried meditation before — the apps, the corporate wellness workshops](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). They never stuck because [I was treating it like another task to optimize](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). This time was different.

What actually [worked for my self-healing process](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb):

* [Five minutes of simply breathing](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) on my apartment floor
* Sometimes crying, sometimes calm, [always showing up](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb)
* [Morning chai while watching](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) the light change
* [No judgment, no performance, just presence](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb)

There’s no perfect way to do this. [There’s only your way](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). Mindfulness [practice doesn’t require special cushions or apps ](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb)— just consistency and honesty.

**Return to what makes you feel alive.**

After my resignation was accepted in June, [I did something I hadn’t done in a decade](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb): I went to Goa alone for a week. [Not for work — just for me](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). I sat on [the beach every morning watching the sunrise](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). I read three novels. I talked to [strangers who didn’t know my job title or my carefully curated Instagram life](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb).

That [trip taught me something crucial about finding yourself again](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb): joy doesn’t require [permission or perfect circumstances](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). It requires presence.

**Action step:** Commit to ten minutes [daily of intentional stillness](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). And plan [one journey before January 1st — big or small ](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb)— where the only goal is presence, not productivity.

# Week 7–8: Rebuilding Real Connection

[**Spend unhurried time with people**](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) **who see you.**

One of my [biggest regrets from my corporate years](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) was how I’d treated [relationships like calendar items to optimize](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). Reconnecting with yourself means reconnecting with what matters.

What I changed in my life reset:

* [Sunday lunches with my parents](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) where I actually sat and talked
* Long walks with [my cousin where we solved nothing but connected](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) to everything
* Video calls with [my childhood friend in Canada](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) where we laughed until our stomachs hurt
* [No multitasking, no phones, no agenda](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) except being together

These [weren’t grand gestures](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). They were simply showing up — [fully, presently, repeatedly](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb).

**Action step:** [Choose three people who matter most](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). Schedule unhurried [time with them before year-end](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). 

# Week 9–10: Going Deeper with the Patterns You Can’t Break Alone

**Here’s what I learned the hard way:** You can [meditate, journal, and travel](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) all you want, but [some patterns need deeper excavation](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). Some wounds [need more than self-help](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). This is where [spiritual transformation goes beyond surface practices](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb).

By August, I could see [my pattern clearly, choosing unavailable people, saying yes when I meant no](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb), feeling responsible for [everyone’s emotions but my own ](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb)— but I couldn’t break it. [I’d tried traditional therapy](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). I’d tried spiritual guidance. [Both helped, but something was missing](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb).

A [friend mentioned an online platform](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) that combined tarot and therapy techniques. I was skeptical. [My previous experiences with spiritual consultation online felt rushed or superficial](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). But I was stuck in life patterns I couldn’t break, and [I needed something different](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb).

**What actually helped: combining insight with action.**

That [first session with a verified spiritual practitioner](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) focused on exploring one challenge deeply — [my pattern with unavailable partners](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). The [authentic tarot reading](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) didn’t just tell me what cards appeared; it helped me:

* Identify the [root cause](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) (childhood dynamics I’d never fully processed)
* Understand why I kept [choosing emotionally unavailable people](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb)
* Leave with two clear, [actionable healing steps to break the pattern](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb)

The two changes I made:

**First:** I set a [specific boundary with my father](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). The conversation went like this: “Dad, [I love you and I value your experience](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). But when you give me [career advice I haven’t asked for](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb), it makes me feel like you [don’t trust my judgment](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). Moving forward, I need you to wait [until I ask before offering suggestions](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb).”

It was [terrifying](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). It was also [transforming](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb).

**Second:** I created a dating guideline:

* Anyone who [doesn’t text back within 24 hours](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) doesn’t get a second date
* Anyone who [cancels plans more than once doesn’t get a third date](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb)
* Anyone who keeps me [guessing about their feelings doesn’t get past a month](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb)
* [No exceptions, no matter](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) how good the chemistry

**Action step:** If you’re stuck in a pattern you can’t break alone, seek [professional spiritual guidance that gives you both the “why” and the “what now.”](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) Look for approaches that combine deep exploration with [practical strategy](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) — whether that’s [therapy, coaching, or transformational spiritual guidance with psychological grounding](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). Sometimes we need both [insight and actionable steps](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) to actually change.

# Week 11–12: Integration Before the Calendar Flips

[**Create new life patterns that stick.**](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb)

The [final two weeks of this pre-new year transformation](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) aren’t about adding more. They’re about making what worked sustainable.

What I established in my year-end reset:

* [Morning pages before checking my phone](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb)
* Evening [walks in my neighborhood](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb)
* One day each [week completely offline](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb)
* Weekly [check-ins with myself](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) about what’s actually working

**Action step:** Choose [three daily practices for transformation](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) from the past weeks that genuinely helped. [Build them into your routine before January arrives](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). Make them [non-negotiable — not because you’re being rigid](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb), but because [you’re worth protecting](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb).

# What I Know Now

Standing here in [late November, closing 2025 mindfully, I’m not “fixed.](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb)” I still have hard days. I still sometimes [catch myself slipping into old patterns](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). But I’m different [in ways that matter](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb).

I know what [my peace feels like now](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb), and I notice immediately when I’m [trading it for something that doesn’t deserve it](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). I have tools for [emotional healing](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) that actually work. I have [people around me who know the real version](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb), not the performing version. [I have a relationship with myself that’s honest and, increasingly, kind](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb).

The [sixty days ahead of you are a gift disguised as a countdown](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). Everyone else is [rushing toward New Year’s resolutions and fresh starts](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb), but you have the wisdom to do something different. [You can end this year by actually ending what needs to end](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). By healing what’s been hurting. By coming [home to yourself before you launch into another year](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) of doing, achieving, and pushing forward.

[This isn’t about becoming someone new](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). It’s about clearing away [everything that’s been covering up who you actually are](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb).

[You don’t need to quit your job](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb). You don’t need to blow up your life. You just need to start paying attention —[ to what hurts, what heals, what matters, and what you’ve been tolerating](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) that you don’t have to tolerate anymore.

[The calendar will flip to 2026 whether you do this work or not.](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) But imagine starting 2026 aligned — [not exhausted and resigned, but grounded and clear.](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb) Not running from yourself, [but finally, beautifully, coming home](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb).

You have [sixty days](https://app.coto.world/NJRmfclDUXb), Start today.

*This personal growth journey is deeply personal and uniquely yours. Whether you’re navigating career transitions, recovering from heartbreak, or simply processing the accumulated weight of 2025, remember that inner transformation isn’t linear, and asking for support isn’t weakness — it’s wisdom.*

Now I work remotely. I contacted a colleague for a project and realized she is the same woman. She also put it together and said she had heard a lot about me and that my voice sounded familiar.

We mostly talk by phone. At first she kept personal details light, but we chatted about normal work things. She told me coworkers tease her for helping me a lot. Lately our work calls turn into 3 to 4 hour conversations about life and interests. She is very busy but still makes time.

I am catching feelings and want to be respectful. We work at the same company and we are in different countries. Coffee is not possible right now. I might be home in 2 to 3 months.

1oksdep,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kefir/comments/1oksdep/need_confirmation/,Need confirmation,"I’ve been making milk kefir for about 5 months now. When I initially obtained my grains the batch would get those whey breaks for the first 2 weeks.

After a month I realized I prefer to strain my kefir every 2 days. So when my grains multiplied I have used more milk about 4 cups and also 3 tbsp of grains and only strain it every 2 days, sometimes leaving it out for 3 days when life gets busy. 

My house is at a constant 74 degrees Fahrenheit and I ferment with a paper coffee filter and rubber band over the top of a glass mason jar.

After 2 days, when I’m ready strain it, there will be some grains and a dried film at the top. I’ll scrape off and throw away the top dried layer and the rest is usually just kind of a creamy mass that won’t come out of the jar unless I agitate it before pouring.

My grains do multiply really fast and my ending kefir does taste creamy and tart. So I think I’m doing it right.

The problem I am having is that my kefir NEVER separates into whey or curds like I have seen on this sub. I’ve even left it out for 4 days and it just stays as a creamy mass and I never see whey pockets.

Is there something wrong with my grains since I never see the whey separate?

1okscve,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1okscve/beast_in_the_pines_part_2_of_3/,"Beast In The Pines, Part 2 of 3","That Friday we headed to Clarence once again. Outside of the music on the radio the car ride was pointedly quieter than usual, less chatty. Nobody said what everyone was thinking, but perhaps it was for the best. A deluge of comments and concerns wouldn’t prevent Dad from finding more dead animals. So we all acted like everything was business as usual. As we passed the  “Welcome to Clarence! Population: 804,” sign, thoughts of the monster that had been congregating in my mind all week began to swarm.

We turned from the old sun baked road and onto the dirt drive way. Whatever cheery ambient banjo music my brain normally played when we arrived at farm was silent. I only heard the tires as they crunched over rocks.

Once we got settled in, Dad told Mom and I to go do our usual grocery shopping. While we were gone he planned to go around the pine rows in Bear and “take a look around” which we all knew meant “search for carcasses.” He assured us he would be fine, putting our minds at ease with a dad joke about his shotgun riding shotgun. 

So Mom and I went by the Piggly Wiggly in Clarence. The same old lady from last time was at the front, greeting us when we walked in. Mom gave me half the grocery list so we could divide and conquer. She wanted to get back to the farmhouse, she didn’t like the idea of Dad out there by himself.

Rounding the corner I went to dodge the bread display but it wasn’t there. I proceeded down the list until I had completed my scavenger hunt, meeting back up with Mom. We checked out, the nice older lady remembering us from last time, and striking up conversation with Mom. I zoned out.

*Maybe the movie tropes were true and it only transformed under a full moon. It wasn’t a full moon this weekend, but it wasn’t a full moon last weekend either, and Dad said the Bobcat was fresh. So what if it was there? Would Dad find more dead animals? Were we really safe like Dad said? What if now it knew we were coming out there and tried to eat us?*

My thoughts were fitful and aimless. The swarm constructing a hive. 

Before I knew it we were back at the farmhouse. From the look on Mom’s face I could see that the same swarm had built a hive in her brain as well. We watched Dad emerge from the front porch as we pulled up. He gave us a wave, his smile seemed hopeful as he approached.

“Good news. I went around the pines and didn’t see any signs of the big nasty varmint.” Dad said ruffling my hair. 

“Really? Peter, do you think maybe it’s wandered off somewhere else?” 

He clicked his tongue, “Eh, I don’t think so, but who knows. I mean I hope so, that would be great.”

“Yeah, let some other bum bury dead animals.” I jeered.

“Yeah!” Dad jeered with me. 

“Maybe that big ugly thing went off and died somewhere!”

“Yeah!”

Mom chuckled, “You two are a couple of clowns. Now can I get some help with the rest of these groceries please?” Dad walked past me to grab an armful of groceries, bumping me over playfully. I laughed, trying and failing to push him over in return. 

Despite the swarm, and all the apprehension built up in my gut, I couldn’t help but want to try and carry on as usual, to treat this weekend like a normal weekend. At least until I was given a reason not to.

The rest of that weekend was like a dream. Friday afternoon I helped Mom with some chores, and then I played outside, finishing the carving in my oak tree, building little houses for fairies with sticks. I saw the cats running around the farm like they normally do. No longer lingering near the Kitty Cat Barn like they were last week. They frolicked in the clovers, basked in the warm rays of sunlight. I enjoyed watching them. That night there was a glorious heavy rain. Mom made a hot beef stew, hearty and savory. 

Tucked in that night I was tired and my belly was full. I wouldn’t have seen anything out the window anyway, so I didn’t look. The tin roof sang me to sleep. 

Saturday was more of the same Arcadian bliss. Aunt Cheryl came to visit on Saturday. She was Mom’s older sister, and while we loved Aunt Cheryl, Dad had taught me to make myself busy when she came around. Poor Mom was left to pull up a chair and listen. She was twice divorced, and at the time she was dating Mr. Neal. She had leathery bronze skin and bleach blonde hair, and smelled like shea butter hand lotion. 

Mom and Aunt Cheryl sat on the porch, and I played in the yard with some Barbie dolls pretending I was extremely busy. They talked about the cold front coming in next week, Aunt Cheryl’s work at the dentist’s office, Aunt Cheryl’s most recent ex-husband’s new girlfriend, Aunt Cheryl’s problems with her heart burn, and Aunt Cheryl’s plans for dinner that night. When Aunt Cheryl went to take a sip of her drink to oil the wheels on her trap, Mom finally got a word in. She said it in a hush, in case I was listening. Which I was.

“Cheryl you haven’t heard anything new recently, you know about the animal attacks?”

Aunt Cheryl responded at full volume.

“Shit, not since you told me about the dead animals y'all found, honey. And Neal hadn’t said nothing about it, but you know Neal. He’s the tall dark and mysterious type. Ya know I told him he needs to quit slouchin’ but he don’t listen to me-“

The conversation trailed off, and a small budding sense of hope began to take root within me. No news was good news, right?

That night, against my better judgement, I slowly eased myself out of bed to peer out the window. I couldn’t help but to shiver when I imagined what I might see. Despite my unease, I was only greeted with the cats, loitering around the small gardening barn, stalking mice among flower bushes. A barn owl called from one of the pecan trees.

I felt that bud of hopefulness start to blossom. 

We drove home on Sunday, and I couldn’t help but to feel disarmed as I peered out the window, admiring the scenery like I used to.

If only I knew how much danger I would soon be in.

The week was filled with delightful tedium. School, homework, a couple afternoons at friends’ houses. I hadn’t told any of my them about the slew of dead animals we had found in Clarence, what I had seen in the pine rows, or much less my werewolf theory. 

Before all of this started I  had asked Mom and Dad if we could to take a friend with us one weekend. They responded positively to that, but I was sure that wasn’t the case now. I had a feeling it would be a while before either of them felt comfortable with that, but if the beast stayed away, then maybe they would become open to the idea again.

I pondered these thoughts as we pulled up to Piggly Wiggly that Friday. We decided to stop by on the way in to town. Dad was running by the hardware store, something about brackets for some roof mounted lights for Bear.

Mom gave me half of the grocery list. As I looked it over, I turned the corner to go down the next aisle and almost bumped into it. The bread display. Once we finished our shopping, we checked out and met Dad by the car. When we asked him if he found the part he was looking for, he began to rant about the hardware store never having what he needed. From there we headed to the farm. 

We pulled up to farmhouse, in good spirits as we unloaded groceries. Once we finished l Mom said I could go play until dinner time, so long as she could see me from the house; but before I could shoot out into the yard, Dad whistled for my attention. 

“Ey! Before you go play, I need you to go feed those cats. They probably need a refill. Make sure they got clean water too.”

Mom and Dad exchanged looks. The Kitty Cat Barn wasn’t in view of the windows.

“Don’t worry Lori, I’m headed over to the shop barn, I’ll be able to keep an eye on her until she can get back into your line of sight.”

I heard Dad whisper something to her under his breath about responsibility, before he came over affectionately grabbing my shoulders as he walked with me to the shop barn. I waited by the door while he fetched me a little bag of cat food and then sent me on my way. I could feel his gaze on me until I was out of sight. 

There were about 10 cats living in the Kitty Cat Barn at a time, not including their kittens. All of them were Nanny’s strays.

Despite knowing they were regularly checked on by Mrs Kerry, I still worried about them, especially out in the wild with some beast on the loose. Though, I felt like a werewolf eating a cat was equivalent to me eating a singular popcorn shrimp. I wasn’t sure if the cats knew that, but perhaps they felt better in the Kitty Cat Barn, being popcorn shrimp in a hard to reach place.

I wrapped my fingers around the lopsided wire-paneled door that bowed on its hinges, allowing the cats easy entry. I stepped through the threshold an initial response of relief to see glimmering eyes shining at me through the musty darkness. However, I was then horrified by the fact that they were *all* there. More than 10, probably 20, all tucked into the shelves, hiding. I stopped dead in my tracks, and stayed dead there for a minute, trying to process what this may have meant, why they were there. Unfortunately, I had an idea. I tried to push through the motions, moving on to the task at hand. I fed them, and they graciously came down to eat. I used the hose to clean their bowl and they gladly drank. I was hopeful that maybe they were just still spooked by “something,” and that perhaps some food and drink would help them perk up. But once they had eaten and drank their fill, they just jumped right back onto their shelves, tucking themselves in like books. Dozens of eyes, pairs of wide luminous globes staring at me with feral transparency. 

*You need to run. You need to hide.* 

I would have gone straight to Dad to report this, but I heard the air compressor running, and I knew that meant “busy,” so I came running back into the house.

“Mom! Mom! The cats are all hiding in the Kitty Cat Barn!”

“What?” She said peaking her head out from doorway to the kitchen.

“There are like 20 cats hiding in the barn, Mom! I-“ 

I paused for a moment, staring out the window.

“I think they might be hiding from the werewolf!”

There was a beat of silence.

“Amy-“ Mom huffed, “come here.”

I did as she said, any fearful wind in my sails shadowed by the threat of a scolding from my mother. I walked timidly into the kitchen as she finished washing her hands, wiping them on her apron before placing them on my shoulders.

“Amy, sweetheart. There was, or is, an animal out there. Absolutely. We don’t know if it’s a wolf or a bear, but we know that it’s one of the two.”

She knew I disagreed, but my better judgement had me keep my mouth shut.

“You are a good girl Amy, and I know you’re not lying to me. Now whether you did see something out there or maybe dreamed it, it doesn’t matter. It scared you, and it would’ve scared me too! I don’t want you to think I don’t believe that you saw what you think you saw, okay? I do. But it’s just not a werewolf, honey, okay? Werewolves are not real.”

She said all of this firmly but, kindly, warmly. With a yearning for understanding in her eyes. 

I loved my Mom, so much. I gave her a small smile. Nodding. 

“Are we in agreement then?”

I nodded.

I wondered if I should start taking into consideration that this wasn’t a werewolf, and that she was probably right. The very thought caused me to psychologically squirm, but maybe I really did just have a nightmare.

That night I laid in bed, kissed and tucked in under fresh linens. Prayers said. I tossed and turned for half an hour before I knocked on the door to Mom and Dad’s room. Pitifully declaring,

“I can’t sleep.” 

Mom lovingly embraced me, probably glad I hadn’t come bursting in about seeing a werewolf. She tucked me back into bed and brought me a glass of warm milk to help me relax. It calmed me enough that when she asked if I was comfortable enough for her to go back to bed, that I said yes. She kissed my forehead, telling me goodnight, and I was suddenly alone again. Warm and snug under the covers, but still awake, staring at the ceiling. 

*Were the cats still huddled in the barn? How long would they cower in there?* 

I turned to look over at the window, until slowly I got up. 

I peaked out the window. One of the flood lights was on the garden barn. Dad had started leaving it on since burying those animals with Mr Voss. Its light cast shadows on the yard and it’s various shrubs and garden beds. I didn’t see any of the cats. None of them played around in the grass or slinked about in the shadows. I sighed, climbing back into bed. I hadn’t laid back down for more than 15 minutes, sleep’s spell almost cast on me when I heard it. 

I heard it. 

The groaning sound of wood in the yard. By the time I’d flipped the covers over to venture out of bed and investigate I heard another sound, right below my window- the crunching of leaves, followed by a very soft high pitched yap. 

I rushed to the window and below it, under the bush, I saw a fox and her kits skulking up against the side of the house. The mother was coming down from a snarl, as though she had just snapped at one of them. I saw the kit in question, coming up to nuzzle the mother with its litter mates.

I didn’t have time to ask myself what they were hiding from. 

A shape loomed in my periphery. From the shadowy outline of the garden shed’s roof I saw a shape emerge. Somewhat indiscernible, a head and a pair of shoulders- human looking, muscular, but very broad- like they’d been unnaturally pushed apart to make room for the tall spinous protrusions of its back. It approached the front most part of the roof turning to the side, and in the inky midnight blue sky its black silhouette engrained itself into my mind for eternity. From the massive torso and arched spine came a long thick neck that ran up to a skull, distinctly canine with a muzzle. The ears were pointed and translucent like the wings of a bat. I watched as one of its abnormally long arms moved dexterously to maneuver its body over the roof. Fear hit my blood stream, and I had to work to contain my scream of panic. My raspy whimper cracked out from my throat as I sprinted to my parents room where it turned into a cry. 

“Daaaaad! Mommmm!”

It was pure instinct, A child running and whimpering to its parents as the kit had beneath my window.

They groaned as they sat up in bed,

“Amy? What is it baby? Are you okay?”

I approached my mom’s side, cowering into my her arms. She held me tight by my wrists, trying to make out what I was saying despite being half asleep. 

A sudden wall within me fell, and defeat consumed me. 

They wouldn’t believe me, but I know what I saw. 

*I know what I saw.*

“Its the werewolf,” the last word came out in slow shaky whimper.

“I swear. I swear Mama.” I gasped between sobs. 

She released a deep breath, holding me close. 

“Amy,” I could hear the sorrow in her voice, but what stung was the disappointment.

“Amy, you saw it out your window?” Dad was on his feet, already at the door to their bedroom.

 I nodded quickly.

I heard him as he moved swiftly down the hall, presumably to go look out my window. He made footfall to the back door, grabbing a shell from the top of the bookshelf, loading it into his shot gun.

Of course, he came back with nothing to report. 

“Amy, you must’ve had a nightmare baby.”

“It was a werewolf! Im not making it up! It was on the garden barn, Daddy it was just there!”

“I looked, baby, and I didn’t see it.”

“Honey we know you’re not lying, you just had a vivid nightmare is all.”

I shook my head and I wept. Not sure what was real anymore.

Mom and Dad let me crawl into bed with them.  

The next morning I heard them talking in hushed tones in the living room, over coffee. About me.

“I was thinking if she saw something on two legs out there that maybe it was just a big man. I talked to Dan yesterday on the phone, he said some people in the area don't want to wait for the game warden- can’t say I entirely blame ‘em- but they might be out there trying to hunt the thing. I don’t know…”

“I thought we had a good understanding yesterday. I should have done more to keep her grounded through all of this, paid more attention, I just-“ I heard my mom sigh, burying her face in her hands. My dad patted her back. 

“I hate that she is going through this. She’s such a good kid.”

“No honey, none of this is your fault. I should’ve gotten more involved-”

“No, no- you’ve been great. Not to mention, you’re working a 9 to 5 all week and then keeping the grounds up here… and burying dead animals as of late. Hopefully this is just a phase she’s going through. I just worry about her you know? The fairy stories, those so called “friends” of hers at school-“

I couldn’t bear to hear any more. Mom and Dad had so much they were trying to juggle, and now I had caused them to worry about me. 

I hated myself for that, I hated that I had made them hurt. 

I tip toed back to their bedroom, crying under the covers for a little while until I had gotten my emotions under control. I wiped my tears and walked into the living room, making sure they saw me run the sleep from my eyes, an excuse for their redness. 

The rest of the day I read mostly. Not wanting to really talk to anyone. I would’ve liked to have played with the cats, but there was no coaxing them from their refuge in the Kitty Cat Barn.

I was mostly quiet at lunch and at dinner, finishing both quickly to “get back to the book I was reading.” Mom and Dad had each made at least one attempt during the day to say something to me about the night before. To make sure I was okay, to ask if I needed or wanted to talk about it. I knew that if we did they would only end up trying to help validate in my mind that it was all a dream. By the end of the day I wished that I was just being an imaginative child, and that I could honestly tell myself that it was just a vivid nightmare. 

Mom and Dad offered to let me sleep with them that night. I thanked them, but refused, assuring them that I would be fine. I told myself that so long as I didn’t look out my window I wouldn’t risk seeing anything, and that gave me comfort. Enough comfort to sleep alone in a dark room with a werewolf possibly outside, anyway. 

To my own surprise I managed to get to sleep well enough, tired from all the emotions I had been untangling for the past 24 hours.

To this day, I cannot say what compelled me to stir from my rest in the middle of the night. I awoke, rubbing my eyes as I got my bearings. 

I had told myself. 

*Don’t go over to the window. Nothing good ever happens when you go over to the window.*

I don’t know if there was a part of me that wanted to prove myself wrong, so I could say to myself, 

*“See? There’s nothing out there. Maybe Mom and Dad are right, and you’re just a dumb little kid having nightmares.”*

I padded over, hearing the friendly creak of the floorboards. I ducked under the lacey curtain veil that my mother had lovingly sewn together and hung up on my window, in all likelihood hoping it would keep me from doing exactly what I was about to do. 

To my everlasting regret, I peered out into the pitch black world beyond the glass. 

Through one of the vintage pane’s I saw something familiar.  A pair of chalky white new balance sneakers, something that I thought was unique to only one person.

I felt my heart sink to the floor. 

The bright white shoes stood out in the underbrush, and I squinted at the way they almost seemed to hover in the darkness. I managed to make out that the figure they belonged to was staggering into the woods. 

*What was wrong with Dad? Was he hurt?*

I remember my mind beginning to free fall, panic setting in. My thoughts fogged up the window pane on a whisper, 

“If I wake Mom, I’ll just make her upset.”

I should have just gotten Mom. God, I should have just gotten Mom. 

But I had cried wolf too many times.

My plan was to go out the back door and call out to him from the stoop. I shuffled out into the night chill, hugging my arms to my chest. 

I had opened my mouth to shout his name, but before I could, I heard the agonizing cry from the figure out in the woods. I’d heard my Dad yelp when he brought a hammer down on his thumb, but I had never heard him cry out like that before. 

It sounded excruciating.

*Had the monster hurt him? Could he walk? Did he need help?*

I watched the figure nearly crumpling over as it staggered into the pine rows.

I- the sweet summer child- thought,

*He isn’t far away.*

*I could catch up to him quickly.*

*I run that distance in P.E. all the time.*  

Before I knew it I was sprinting through the yard with confidence, I knew every rock, ant hill, and arching root. It was all mostly open space until you got to the concrete slab in front of the shop barn where Dad parked the Backhoe and Bear. My eyes slowly began to adjust to the dark. I ran on tiptoe across the icy cold concrete slab. I didn’t even have any shoes on. 

I stopped to take a better look at the barn. The lights weren’t on. Dad hadn’t been working on anything. What in the world was he doing out here so late? Did he see something?

I peered into the pine rows. No sight of the figure. 

I wanted to call out to him, but hesitated. If that thing was out here I wasn’t going to draw its attention to us. 

He couldn’t have been more than half a football field away. I could catch him.

I ran through the frigid night air, my heart knocking like a piston within my chest. My gaze swung between the pine trunks as I scanned the rows. Seeing nothing, I continued to run. The monotony of the trunks and the rows and the waves of pine straw putting me into a trance. 

How many rows back had I gone? Was this a football field- or half a football field?

*Surely I would have seen Dad by now.*

By the grace of God I stopped, warm blood pumping through my chest, I tried to catch my breath as quietly as I could. The pines stood in formation around me, a sprawling arboreal army. 

It felt like some dense mass had been dropped down my throat until it hit the bottom of my stomach, sinking like a stone. The nausea set in as I became cognizant of my situation, my instincts being translated into a flimsy string of cohesive thought. 

*Dear God. Dear God. I had ran too far.*

*You idiot. You stupid dumb little child.*

I became very still. 

Soft tender moonlight trickled through the pines, pearly beams scattering across the fallen pine needles.

I looked out, down the corridors of trees. Making out a shape a few rows over, I squinted, shifting my head to see through the trunks. When I realized what I was seeing my eyes grew very wide, and my spine grew rigid. Terror hit me like lightning.

It was far enough away that I hadn’t seen it at first, but not so far that I couldn’t now see it in painful clarity. 

It moved like a wraith in a crypt, a lean, creeping monstrosity. I remember thinking how fast it looked. How little time it would likely take it to get to me.

I took slow silent steps backwards willing to do this all the way home if I had to. Now acutely aware of my surroundings, I stepped and felt a pang of hope. When I stepped there was no crunch in the pine needles.

Thinking this was to my advantage, I made a handful of quick steps until suddenly, to my corporeal horror, it stopped. I watched as its ears fanned upwards, unnaturally long and pointy. Its head turned on its long neck, the top of its muzzle moved up in a familiar motion. A sniff. 

It could smell me.

Slow and shaky steps turned quickly into a full sprint in the opposite direction, I nearly held my breath as I ran, trying to keep myself as quiet as possible. I bit my lips to keep from whimpering. I hoped I would be able to hear him if he started to run towards me.

But it dawned on me that what I had moments ago thought to be to my advantage was now to my great detriment- 

*When I stepped- there was no crunch.*

I was suddenly also painfully aware of how bright neon pink my nightgown was in the darkness.

My jaw began to quiver as I pressed forward. I cut diagonally across the rows, moving in the general direction of the farmhouse. 

I ran like this, cutting across row after row after row until suddenly I collided with the ground, having tripped on a groove in the earth. In that moment I remember thinking that between keeping my tears at bay and fighting the urge to involuntarily wet myself, I knew something had to give. Urine it would smell, but hopefully not tears. That thought alone, and how hopelessly dead I began to realize I was caused them to fall like a downpour, cascading down my cheeks. Cold rivers on my warm flushed face. I scrambled up, again fighting the urge to whimper, until my blurry eyes caught sight of what I had tripped on. 

The groove I had tripped on was one of many, claw marks that had slashed up layers of pine needles and ripped into the earth. Less than half a row away was a pile of clothes, among them were the treasonous pair of white new balance sneakers, cast aside haphazardly. 

I wish I could say that I told myself to calm down and think, but I didn’t. My hippocampus, my amygdala, one of them went AWOL and violently threw open the filing cabinet labeled “*Wolves*.”

 In all my follies that evening I made one decision that might have saved my life.

I stripped off my neon pink nightgown, flinging it to the side. 

Down to nothing but my Barbie underwear, I yanked the shirt up from the ground, sliding it over my head.

I grabbed the jacket, hurriedly slipping my arms into the sleeves.

It was huge on me, and smelled like cigarettes, but more importantly it wasn't bright pink and it would mask my smell. The smell of Mr. Bubble bath soap and warm milk. 

With less than a couple of seconds to make a decision that I was willing to bet my life on, I frantically assumed that if the beast followed my scent diagonally through the pine rows that I would go diagonally the opposite way, but still in the direction of the house. 

Hurtling forward I thought this would be a great plan until it occurred to me that it would see me. It would have one chance of seeing me from down the pine rows, I could only hope that I was far enough away. 

Adrenaline eventually took all my thoughts by the collar and kicked them out. Fate had dealt me a handful of seconds for thinking and I had used them up. My only task now was to act on them and pray.

As I ran I mustered up the courage to pivot and look beside me down the pine rows. Painfully aware that I was at the indefensible mercy of what I might see. 

After crossing over half a dozen rows I saw a flash. The most terrifying blur I had ever seen. I only vaguely made out its shape. Headed in the direction I had been in less than a minute before. There was no speculating about it. 

The monster was after me. 

I could see light from the farmhouse, an angel reaching out in the night. Mom and Dad had realized that their baby girl wasn’t tucked in bed under her daisy quilt. My heart began to ache. I could practically smell the remnants of smoke from my dad’s pipe, feel the crisp linen sheets mom had just put on the bed. I choked back a sob. 

I continued to run until I emerged from the pine rows, right beside the shop barn. For a splintering second I thought of the naive child that  had stood there not 15 minutes ago, preparing to run into the devil’s hunting ground.

 I was so close, so close to the house. 100 yards at the most. I was ready to collapse in on myself, fall into hysterics in the safety of my parents arms. 

But as I reached the shop barn I stopped. Dead in my tracks. A tug, a pull, a gut feeling. A memory from the night before. 

Surely, the shop barn was too tall.

But the oak tree beside it- beside me- wasn’t. 

My head snapped up to my right. 

It sat like a looming gargoyle on the burled apex of the oak’s twisted knotted branches, its enormous torso coiled up in the dark, ready to strike had I taken a few steps further.

The shadow of the barn had concealed me, but not for long. I watched as a cadaverous  front limb slid down the trunk from the dark and into the unholy moonlight. Massively elongated human palms and fingers, the bones bowing horrifically outwards like paws, tipped with keratinous claws that bit into the bark. I took a step backward. I watched in terror as the hand revealed an arm, muscled like a human’s but twice as long and curved at an unnatural angle. 

I darted into the barn. I knew I didn’t have more than a second or two. 

I stumbled in through the doorway. I was going to make a break for the upstairs loft, but I opted not to for fear of being cornered.

My eyes only had enough time for one vicious sweep of the room. They landed on a solid wooden workbench up against the wall with a trash can beneath it. I raced over, frantically crawling under it, unbothered by the cobwebs. Beside me was a bucket with various lengths of PVC pipe. With whatever borrowed time I didn’t have, I reached to move it to my side and block me in under the bench.

I was unaware of the chains wound up in the bottom like snakes. 

I heard the grit from the bottom of the bucket scrape against the cement and I wanted to vomit.

I peered out from my hiding spot, a tall ominous shape standing still in the doorway. 

For all I knew, the scrape was inconsequential, perhaps it had already seen me and I was as good as dead anyway.

My cheeks were cold, but I felt the warm trails of tears still on my face.

I watched as it entered the barn. It’s lean disfigured arms came into view first, the muscles slithering beneath the skin as it moved. Its torso was human but wide, stretched outwards unnaturally. The hips were the same way, narrow, but also having been stretched to achieve its new unholy function. It’s legs were much like the arms, and the feet much like the hands.

It stalked into the barn, sniffing the air. Once beside the bench it slowly began to crouch towards the ground. 

I was nearly blind with fear as it lowered itself.

As its head came into my line of sight I caught my breath in my throat. Below the bridge of the nose was oversized abnormal canine, as though its snout had erupted out of a human face. Its jaws and teeth were so large, and the skull had morphed to accommodate it. 

I could feel the heat radiate from the creature. Like it was on fire, burning and expending more energy than the vessel was meant to. I felt a wave of warmth wash over my legs but I was too petrified to register it.

However abhorrently vile and evil its entire form was, it eyes were what shattered me.

It’s eyes are what I see every time I close my own, every night of my life.

They were hauntingly and devastatingly human. A man’s eyes. Green. Glassed over. The eyes nor the brows moved as it sniffed the air beside my hiding spot. They remained unfazed despite the snarl on its pale lips, or the twitch in its ears as it listened for me and instead heard something else. 

The eyes were fixed in place, looking wherever the neck told it to. I watched as it slowly tilted its head at the sound, as if its interest had been gradually piqued. 

A few seconds later I heard the quick and heavy footsteps of my Dad approaching from outside the barn, followed by Bear roaring to life. The engine bellowed as he hit the gas. 

Like a shot, the beast moved out of the barn, seemingly in one silent spider like motion. Faster than wind. The sudden absence of its immense presence gutted me.  

I don’t know when, but I realized that at some point my hand had slowly crept over my mouth in horror.

I sat there for what felt like an hour. Sure that it was by the door. Waiting for me to come running out. 

I sat, every muscle in my body tensed until I heard a howl in distance. 

When you hear a wolf howl in a scary movie, it’s so weightless. Often times it means nothing, merely an overused sound bite to set the mood.

What I heard caused whatever part of my psyche that was spiritual to tremble. 

It was both an animalistic howl and a human scream. 

It was anguish and rage and hunger. 

Tears fell as I thought of my Dad. I came out here thinking I was helping him and I might’ve just gotten him killed. The dam was ready to burst, but I had to get home first. 

I delineated for a few moments. Unabashed horror holding me in a vice. I shook violently as I clumsily came out from under the bench. Feeling something wet I looked down. I had wet myself. I realized that I hadn’t gotten lucky. I had outsmarted nothing. The beast left because I was popcorn shrimp in a hard to reach place.

Not every time, but most times now when I make espresso when I hit the OK button this is happening. It doesn't happen with coffee (haven't checked Americano yet).

First it sounds like it's doing it's thing - the pressure gage goes up and it makes the right noises, but then just a sick little trickle comes out, then the pressure drops and it stops. Sometimes it will then tell me I need to add water (there's plenty of water). It doesn't do that every time though. I top the water up to the max and try again (with the same portafilter - I don't remove it) and it gives me sort of half coffee/half espresso.

I have unplugged, waited and plugged back in. Got two good espressos and then this issue came up again.",1,1761911079.0,DeLonghi,0,1.0,False

1oksat4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalSocial/comments/1oksat4/the_wildest_thing_ive_ever_seen_someone_do_to/,The wildest thing I’ve ever seen someone do to survive in Kathmandu.,"My (ex) friend let's say “**Shakiraaaa**” was the one who actually did it.

She was 26, living alone in a tiny 1BHK in Baneshwor. The ceiling leaked, and her landlord would bang on the door every 1st of the month asking for 15k rent. Her salary was 22k after tax.

One month, her brother’s remittance from Qatar got delayed. Dashain expenses had already drained her savings, and the landlord threatened to change the lock.

Scrolling Instagram one night, she found a Dubai-based account DMing random Nepali girls:

>***“Clean feet, good arches, 500 AED per set.”***

That’s around 19,000 NPR for 10 photos. No face. No name. Just soles on a white bedsheet.

She laughed at first. Then opened eSewa and saw the balance: Rs. 1,500.

The next evening, she went to Bhatbhateni, bought a Rs. 400 white bedsheet, painted her nails red (the guy’s request), locked her door, and took 15 photos on burst mode. She sent the best 10 through Telegram.

Money transferred in 10–20 minutes. She paid her rent, bought groceries, and treated herself to a Rs. 300 coffee like nothing had happened.

We stopped being friends a month later, not because I judged her hustle, but because she started scaling it. She began coaching other 1-2 girls from of her friends circle and took a 20 percent cut as their manager. Last I heard, she had stopped doing it, got married, and moved out of Nepal.

The funniest part, she actually suggested I do a pedicure and make my feet look good like a girl because, apparently, my white feet would sell. I just laughed and stayed out of it. 😑🥲

But, the worst thing she did was turn survival into a startup for few months.

Okay, now I’m curious. What’s the wildest thing you’ve seen someone do for cash?",3,1761911050.0,NepalSocial,28,1.0,False
1oksa51,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1oksa51/beast_in_the_pines_part_1_of_3/,"Beast In The Pines, Part 1 of 3","My mom and dad were born and raised in Clarence, an old small town in the countryside between the midlands and the coast. A flat woodland, lush from its snaking rivers and creeks. Its swamps bled into the marshes and down through the deltas into the salty southern coast that was a little over an hour away. Clarence was the little nothing-town people passed when they drove down to the beach for vacation. 

My grandparents, Nanny and Papa, owned a pine tree farm in Clarence. 100 acres, and 75 of those acres were rows upon rows of loblolly pine trees. They lived on the property in a small farmhouse at the end of a long dirt driveway. It was small, and while it may have been nearly prehistoric, it never felt creepy. It felt like a cozy respite, a home away from home; sitting like an island in the middle of a large yard dotted with gnarled towering oak, walnut, and pecan trees. There were rickety barns as old as the dirt they sat on. Sprawling garden beds with herbs, flowers and vegetables. Wooden arbors overgrown with pluming heaps of muscadine grape vines. All acting as a buffer for the pine rows that surrounded the house on three sides. 

The remaining 20-or-so acres behind the pine rows were dense woods, cut down the middle by a winding trail that lead to the river. Nanny and Papa had clear-cut those 75 acres and planted the pines about 10 years prior. Papa passed away when I was small, and Nanny wasn’t far behind him, passing a few years later.

We inherited their cherished little farmhouse and pine tree farm.

We couldn’t live at the farm, of course. My Dad already had a job, and nobody gets a weekly paycheck to watch pine trees grow. So while adding the upkeep of a farm would be a heavy burden on top of a 9-5 work week, it was a labor of love that my parents were used to. Before Nanny passed, we would come down to Clarence to visit her every other weekend, giving her a hand with house work and yard work- especially as she got older. In the spring and summer it was more like every weekend, a constant battle for my Dad to keep the vegetation from taking over.

Despite how exhausting it sounded, my busy-body parents enjoyed it. The farm was a way of staying near their family and friends, all while enjoying the rural lifestyle of their hometown again. Getting themselves and their only daughter away from the buzz of suburbia.

At the time of this story, the pines were somewhere between 12-15ft tall. Nanny had passed away in October and we didn’t return until spring that next year. It was the mid 90s, and I was 8 years old. 

We left home that March on a Friday afternoon and head down the interstate towards Clarence and our pine tree farm, a routine that we knew well. It was a 45 or-so minute drive, and once we pulled into town and got situated, Dad would stay at the house and start on yard-work. Mom and I would go to the grocery store, getting enough food to last us until we left Sunday afternoon.

The only grocery store in Clarence was the old Piggly Wiggly. I distinctly remember the sweet wrinkled smiles of its employees and the smell of cigarettes that hung in the air. 

Mom and I stood in the checkout line.

“Oh shi- shoot! Oh shoot! Honey I forgot the bread, can you run and grab one for me real quick?”

I gave her a chirpy “yes ma’am” and moved swiftly towards the bread aisle. I skirted to a stop when I realized there was a small display right there by checkout. A table laid out with checkerboard table cloth, loaves carefully placed in circular tiers. I snatched up a loaf, brought it to my mom and we headed home. 

We drove back to the farmhouse in my Mom’s station wagon, a new single by Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers was on the radio. Anticipation began to build as I stared eagerly out the window, in childish awe of the countryside’s vast emerging greenery.

We turned off of the road, patches of field on either side of the long dirt driveway leading up to the farmhouse, which sat at the end like a lady. A sweet, modest, classy thing, built in 1903. She was stark white, laced with gingerbread trim. Full, blossoming azalea bushes hemmed the wide front porch like a skirt, all of her topped off with an evergreen tin roof that sang me to sleep in the rain.

My mom backed her station wagon up to the front porch and I helped her as we began to take in groceries. 

We heard him coming before we saw him. A humming engine sang over a chorus of baying hounds. 

It was Mr. Voss, our neighbor. His hunting beagles running spiritedly behind his ATV, a howling snarling cloud of dust tearing down the road before turning into our driveway.

My Dad pulled up beside us in his creaky old brown work truck, that I had affectionately named “Bear,” when I was small. Because it was brown, and it growled. 

Dad hopped out. He ruffled my hair, and gave my mom a kiss on the cheek.

“Hey squirt. Hey honey, Dan called- said we needed to talk.”

“Everything okay?”

“I guess we’ll find out. Hope so. Need any help with those groceries?”

“No, no, I’ve got my sidekick here helping me, you invite Dan inside and I’ll bring you boys something to drink.”

Dad gave me a wink and a pat on the back before he walked up to greet Mr. Voss who had pulled up and cut the power on his ATV, his dogs gallivanting off to play and sniff around. My dad always looked so big and strong to me, but next to Mr Voss he looked small. I heard the frame creak as he dismounted his machine. 

Daniel Voss was Clarence’s nearly retired fire chief, and when he wasn’t in uniform he was in camo. He shook Dad’s hand with a pursed smile under his mustache, and nodded towards my mother and me.

“Mrs Willis, little Miss Willis,” 

He directed his attention back to my dad. “Thanks for letting me stop by, Peter.”

“Hey, no problem man. Everything alright? You sounded serious over the phone.”

My mom took the last bag of groceries and shooed me off to play. I was old enough to understand that the adults were talking and I needed to scadaddle. However, I was also a talented eavesdropper, as most children are. I ran along the side of the house, sneaking in through the back door. I found a nice hiding spot behind a small wooden bench in the hallway. There was a mirror on the wall, giving me a peak into the living room where Dad knelt striking a match in the fireplace, while Mr. Voss made comments about the weather and the sitting president. 

After Mom had put away the groceries she joined them with a handful of empty glasses. She grabbed a bottle of whisky from the top of the china cabinet and poured them all a shot of the syrupy golden spirit. Mr Voss sat in the tattered plaid wingback by the fireplace, a small modest flame beginning to crackle in its hearth. He laced and re-laced his fingers, as if he was somewhat apprehensive to begin the conversation until suddenly he cleared his throat.

“So Peter, Lori, I know y’all just rolled into town, but I had to fill you folks in on what’s been going on around here lately. It’s a matter of safety, especially with yer little youngin’ running around.”

I always thought it was such a shame that Mr Voss chewed tobacco all the time. Not only because I thought spitting dip was gross, but because it prevented him from speaking as much. Mr Voss sounded like the lowest string on a fiddle, his vocal chords oiled with old southern blood. A lullaby with seamless rises and dips in cadence, every sentence a resonant stanza in a ballad. He would recall a trip to the post office to the tune of an old campfire story. 

That early evening in March, as dusk and its chill fell upon the treetops of Clarence and the sun sank low in a peach colored sky, I noticed that Mr Voss’ speech was unobscured by his usual lip full of dip. 

I settled into my hiding spot. This must be serious. Mr Voss was about to spin a yarn.

“So, all of this started in late November, best we can all surmise. Rumors began floating around right after Thanksgiving. Late November, 'ya know, 'ya had boys out there on their land or their buddy’s land hunting deer and ducks, doves and geese. Fat and happy in their camo, believe me I was one of ‘em. But a few of ‘em made some grizzly discoveries. They, uh, found some animal carcasses while they were huntin’.” 

The puzzled looks on my parents faces were suddenly imbued with concern. Mr Voss took a sip of his whisky and continued, 

“As I’m sure you both know, eastwards, right yander across the river from your property is Ed Kerry’s huntin’ land. He’s got about 50 acres or thereabouts. Well, Kerry and his boys were huntin’ in the wee hours of the morning, planning on shacking up in a little hunting stand near a clearing in the center of the property. Once they got up there and started lookin’ around, they found a buck-”

His voice cracked for a moment as his eyes flickered between Mom and Dad. 

“-a *mutilated* buck… At first, they thought it was a pack of coyotes, maybe a bobcat. But the more they saw, the harder it was to rationalize in their minds. Now Peter, Lori, I don’t mean to be graphic, but I think it’s important that you know the details.” 

He paused, waiting for one of them to stop him, but neither did. 

“It was fresh. The neck was broken, violently. It had been ‘eviscerated’ as one of Kerry’s boys put it. Ed said it was a mess, carnage just- everywhere. Something had taken a bite through its leg at the haunches, cracked right through the bones, and crushed the socket when it ripped it out. Ed said the bite was this big,”

He gestured, but from outside of my peeping-mirror’s view.

My Dad exhaled in disbelief.

My mom winced, a pained look on her face.

“My God, Dan.”

“By December’s end they had found that buck, and a few more animals torn up to a similar degree. The week before Christmas, I was in the field near the border of your property, and I saw a lump of fur layin' off yander in the field. I was worried it was one of my beagles. But once I got up close to it I saw it was a coyote. There were these deep gashes, from the tips of the ribs on one side to the tips of the ribs on the other. I could see the oval shape of the bite mark, it had a set of jaws- I mean a *big* set jaws, like Ed had said. Must’ve just held its ribcage in its mouth and bitten down on it.”

 Mr Voss paused, lost in thought for a moment.

“Peter I’ve never seen anything like it. It was a nightmare, I’m just glad the wife didn’t stumble on it.”

Mr Voss downed what was left of his whisky. I heard the clink of his glass as he sat it on coffee table. 

“Then, about 2 weeks later David Kilpatrick and his daughter were out huntin’ on Kerry’s land. 'Ya know Kerry’s boy, Joey, been sweet on her for a while, so Kerry lets Dave take her out there huntin’. Give Joey something to bond with her over and all that. Well, the little lady bags her a doe, so her and Dave head over to it, trudging through all the brush and fallen leaves and what have 'ya to tag it. As they’re walking over, girl goes to hop over this recently fallen sweet gum tree. That poor child landed in a dead buck’s corpse. It was almost all skeleton, but fallin into a leathery cracked-open rib cage shakes her up pretty good. Dave said that its head was all gnawed up with big ol’ teeth marks, and the antlers were crunched. Now I don’t know about you but I’ve never heard of a bite that’d crunch antlers on a deer like that.”

My dad shook his head, staring off in a daze. “No, never.”

“Well, then Neal found another coyote, said it looked just like the one on my property. But who knows, it could’ve been skinned alive and split in half and Neal wouldn’t mention it. You know Neal, you could tie him to the railroad tracks and he’d barely mumble about it. Last thing I’d heard was a week ago when Bill found a doe. He was near the border of your property, said he’d been fixing a fence post earlier that day and left his pack of smokes out there. So he hopped in his truck in his pajamas that night and went back to fetch 'em. The same fence post he’d fixed was broken again, and not 10 feet from it was a doe. She’d been ripped apart at the rib cage. Bill said it looked like a damn frog dissection from high school.”

All of them were silent for a long moment, the only sound the crackling in the fireplace.

Dad spoke up, “What is everybody thinking? A bear?”

I heard Mr Voss sniff, as he nodded. “Bear. Maybe a big wolf.”

“I’ve heard of bear wandering down this far south occasionally, but a wolf? I don’t know…”

Mr Voss inclined his hand toward the the whisky bottle on the table, Dad encouraged him to help himself, so Mr Voss poured everyone another finger.

“A bear, a wolf, whatever it is- it’s a devil. The damage it does is just- gruesome.” 

“Nobody's found any tracks?”

“Not in the leaves. You know how it is this time of year. You’re practically wading through ‘em.”

Mr Voss sighed as he fiddled with the glass, so small in his hands.

“But I wanted to catch you as soon as you arrived, Peter, and I know I don’t need to spell this out for you, yer a smart fella. But we’re finding bodies north, south, east and west of here, and l’m not trying to alarm you folks but- I think you know as well as I do that you might have some dead animals on your property.”

At that I decided to make my exit, sneaking away from my hiding spot. I figured I would need to be in position when Mom or Dad came to tell me about my inevitable new ground rules. 

I ran off to the squatty structure near the back of the house, what my Nanny had called “The Kitty Cat Barn.” It was a dilapidated flat-roof barn, enlaced with morning glories that crawled through the rusted rotting holes in its ancient metal siding. It seems to have once been a small barn for a couple of work animals like donkeys or small horses, but Papa had put shelves up and Nanny just used it to store her preserves. However as she and Papa got older, they garnered a large collection of stray cats, as the sweet and elderly have a habit of doing. So near the end of their life, they gave away all their preserves to their kids and their friends from church and stocked the shelves instead with baskets and boxes, lined with soft old towels and worn rags. Setting out a couple dozen of little bowls for them to eat from. When we weren’t there, one of our neighbors, Mrs. Kerry, gladly came out and fed them for us in exchange for herbs from the garden, though she rarely ever took any. 

I squatted on the dirt floor of the barn. It wasn’t long before a handful of kittens clumsily wandered out to investigate my presence. Moments later, what I assumed was their mother, came over and began nuzzling up against me. I rubbed gently behind her velvety ears before walking out of the barn. I made sounds gesturing for the kittens to come out into the grass to play, but their mood shifted and they would not come. They only stood in the doorway beside their mother, watching me. I scoffed. *Cats*.

Not a moment later, Mom came over, asking if we could talk. We sat on one of the steps of the back door stoop. She gave me a frank but watered down version of Mr. Voss’s story, then laid down the law. 

 “No playing in the pine rows, and no going outside for any reason after sunset. If you see something, anything, out of the ordinary- come tell myself or your father, immediately. Are we clear?”

“Yes ma’am.”

She asked if knew what to do if I was approached by a bear or a wolf, and I prattled off the steps to her. Don’t run. Back away slowly. If it approaches you, try to make yourself look big. All that. I can tell this relaxed her a bit, and she told me to have fun playing, and to be careful. 

The rest of the day was as pleasant as any day when you were 8. I ran aimlessly all over the yard, not much different from Mr Voss’s beagles. I stopped by the arbor to pick muscadine grapes. I helped Mom do some work in the flower beds, and before I knew it it was time to come inside. She threw a Disney movie into the small tube television in my room while she worked in the kitchen. Dad came in and washed up from doing yard work all day, the farmhouse’s old pipes groaning as he showered. We had dinner that night, I can’t recall what it was, but it was warm and I went back for seconds. After Dad and I cleaned the kitchen for Mom, we all sat at on the floor of the living room, playing Old Maid and talking by the fire. As the evening drew to a close, we all started getting ready for bed. 

That was the first night I saw the beast.

I remember it well. 

After I had given Dad a kiss and told him goodnight, Mom tucked me into bed under the fresh linens she had put on earlier that afternoon. She kissed my head reminding me to say my prayers before turning off the lights and closing the door, bidding me goodnight. 

Prayers said, I waited for sleep to overcome me but it never did. I tossed and turned for a while, before quietly sliding out of bed and slinking over to my window. The cats would always come out at night, and the view from outside of my bedroom window happened to be a particularly high traffic cat crossing. 

There were bushes beneath my window, and looking past them you could see paths that wound between and around garden beds brimming with various flowers and herbs. Behind them was the smallest of the barns that adorned the yard, Nanny had used it for storing gardening equipment and potting soil. It may have been geriatric, but it was a sturdy structure. It had survived an oak falling on it a couple years before and still stood tall. Behind it was a small stretch of field, and then the sea of pine rows.

I peered out of the antique, single pane glass. Keeping my breaths shallow as to not fog it up. I searched the shadows for cats, when my eye caught something in the distance. Deer occasionally appeared during these midnight matinees, strolling in the field or leaping through the pine rows. 

But this shape wasn’t moving like that.

The more I focused in on it, the more I saw that it was larger than I had thought. Larger than a deer. My sleepy brain began to dial in, seemingly aware that this was something outside of our routine viewing. I concentrated on the shape, holding my breath so as to ease my face as close to the glass as possible.

It prowled beneath the branches, its spine arched, its limbs creeping like a spider. Slow, deliberate movements, its ashen form lurked in the dark obscurity of the pine rows. It horrified me to think that if I hadn’t been deliberately looking at it, I could have cast a glance out the window and not even noticed it. 

Being that I was child, I did what any child might do. In my horror, I hyperventilated and broke into tears. I went running into my parents’ room. Desperate and pitiful, trying to explain to them what I saw. Mom was quick to fall into her maternal instincts, holding me close, wiping away my tears and stroking my hair. My Dad rubbed my back to comfort me, but his mind had gone back to the discussion with Mr Voss. 

“Did you see its face honey? Did it look like a bear?”

I quickly shook my head, eyes still wet with tears. 

“No- no it wasn’t a bear. It was too… too tall and long. A- a bear would be… less- gangly. This wasn’t. And it didn’t have any fur. It was-”

The more I thought back on the beast the more scared I became, all over again, until I burst into tears. I buried my face into my mother’s shoulder.

“It was so awful,” I sobbed, 

“I just want it to never come back.” 

My parents exchanged sympathetic looks. I slept in bed with them that night.

The next day was business as usual. In the morning after breakfast I helped Mom with some chores and then was released into the yard to play. I rode my bike up and down the dirt driveway while I listened to my Walkman. Mom watched me from the front porch while she mended some of Dad’s overalls. After a while she called me to help her again in the garden. We watered and weeded until it was time for lunch. Mom made grilled cheese and tomato soup. Dad came in, just having finished weed-eating, so he was a little dirty and peppered with blades of grass. We talked and ate and joked around. It wasn’t until Mom and I were doing the dishes that I noticed that Dad had vanished.

“Where’s Dad?” I asked, a little incredulously, at the absence of my dishwashing partner.

Mom’s eyes never left her work as she spoke, 

“He’s meeting Mr Voss.”

“Why?”

“Just to check out the Pine Rows”

She said nonchalantly. I didn’t press her about it, I knew they were out searching for dead animals.

Dad didn’t return until it was nearly dinner time. He didn’t say hey, he didn’t go to the kitchen for something to drink, he went straight to the shower. I could hear the pipes from my bedroom. During dinner, Dad seemed tired, but he put on a tired smile, asking me about my day and what all Mom and I had been up to. I had a feeling he didn’t want me to ask about his day, so I blabbed about everything Mom and I had done, how the cats were acting, and the songs I listened to on my Walkman. After we ate, I asked if I could go watch a movie in my room until lights out. My parents eagerly obliged. 

I sat cross legged on my bed, pretending to watch the Black Cauldron, I saw Dad pass my bedroom door. I tiptoed over, peaking my head out, watching him make his way wearily through the house and out to the front porch. I heard the pipes creak and knew Mom would be joining him shortly. 

Sensing an interesting conversation on the horizon, I took up a hiding spot near a coat rack by the front door, with a great view out the window and onto the front porch. I watched as Dad fell back into a rocking chair, exhausted. He packed and lit his briar pipe. The sky bore pearly hues of blush and lilac as it laid the day to rest. Dad leaned back, the embers in his pipe akin to the glow of the sunset as he took a long deep pull, exhaling a swirling plume of smoke.

I ducked down as Mom walked by. Her skin still rosey from her hot shower. Her hair was thrown up in a bun, and all her makeup was off. But she was more beautiful than the dusk sky, and Dad’s eyes corroborated my opinion. 

She met his gaze with a gentle smile, joining him in an adjacent rocking chair with a glass of wine in one hand and a beer in another. 

“I saw your bloody jeans in the hamper. I assume you had a 'work boots' kind of day.” She said with a weak laugh.

Dad scoffed. Mom always teased him for wearing the same pair of very-off-white New Balances all the time. She used to make comments to me on the days she saw them sitting by the back door, saying that he must be out doing dirty work. 

“You and Dan found an animal out there today?”

“Multiple.” Dad replied, his pipe hanging from the corner of his mouth as he cracked open his beer. 

“Two deer, a coyote, and a bobcat. We buried one of the deer and the bobcat. The rest of them were decayed enough or out of the way enough that we said ‘to hell with it.’”

Mom pensively said nothing.

“Dan called his game warden buddy, kind of a jack-ass, in my opinion. He told us to get photographic evidence. So Dan snapped some photos, said he’s gonna get ‘em developed tomorrow afternoon.”

The were a few lingering moments of silence until Mom spoke, asking softly,  

“What had happened to them?”

I heard Dad’s pipe clack between his teeth after taking another pull. By then the woody aroma had drifted into the house from under the front door. The smell of his tobacco was earthy, rich and sweet. He paused, taking a swig of his beer before answering. 

“A few of the deer seemed to have recently rotted down to their skeletons. Lots of their bones were broken, so we couldn’t quite put together what had happened to them; and ya’ know the vultures had probably gotten to ‘em and moved stuff around too. The coyote carcass was maybe a month old, it looked something had put a bunch of weight down on its ribs and crushed it. The bobcat-“

Dad stopped for a moment, as if remembering in awe.

“The bobcat was fresh Lori, real fresh. Past 24 hours fresh.”

“Oh my God, Peter.”

“It was a big one too. We found it at the base of a black walnut tree. It looked like it’s spine had been snapped against the trunk, and then something just-“ dad gestured with his hands, digging at the air. Sparing the gory details.

“All the blood on my clothes was from the Bobcat.”

“Well, thank God we didn’t let Amy play in the pine rows yesterday, how far was it from the house?”

“It was near the back of the rows, towards the woods. After we found and buried it we decided to call it quits for the day, but we’ll finish tomorrow, Dan said he’d help me.”

“Finish?”

“Yeah, we only got halfway around the pines, Lori. We still have to look around the other half tomorrow.”

The quiet returned for a few moments. Hanging in the air with the smoke from Dad’s pipe.

“Lori, don’t let Amy out of your sight.” I saw Mom nodding her head.

“I’m gonna keep the Benelli by the back door, it’s the semi-automatic, I remember you said you felt comfortable with that one. And I’m gonna keep the thirty-thirty, the Marlin, by the front door. I doubt it would just come up to the house in broad daylight, but I want you to be prepared in case I’m not here at the house with you.”

“That’s a good idea. And I think when Amy plays outside I need to tell her to stay in view of the windows. So you or I can see her.”

“Okay, good thinking. And we’ll need to ask her not to have her Walkman on her ears while she’s out there. I don’t want something sneaking up on her.”

Mom scoffed, “She’s not gonna like that.”

“Nah, she’s smart. If we explain it to her I’m sure she’ll understand.”

I didn’t like that. 

But I knew as well as they did that I would, in all likelihood, comply. Mom and Dad were reasonable, so I usually did.

“I know this is all scary for her- shit, it’s scary for all of us.”

“What the hell do you think this thing is Peter?”

 Dad let out a long exasperated sigh, as though he’d been asking himself that very thing all day. “The best thing I can figure is a bear. A very, very large bear. But who knows, I mean, we looked, but we didn’t see any tracks or scat or anything.”

“There were no tracks near the path? Even near the bobcat?”

Dad shook his head, “Too many pine needles. I mean years and years worth. We saw indentions in the earth under them, but nothing we could decipher.”

Dad finished his beer, setting it down on the ground by his rocking chair.

“Tomorrow, Dan’s gonna help me check the second half of the pine rows. He said one day next week he could send his nephews out on their four wheelers to check the woods that back up to the river.”

“Oh gosh is that safe?”

“It’s been a few years but those little rascals are grown, they’re young men now, they’re almost as tall as Dan.”

Mom hummed, not convinced, but opting to move on. “That’s nice of Dan to help you.”

“Yeah, he didn’t ask for anything but I told him I’d throw him and his nephews some cash for the help. I wish I could say I was hopeful, but I worry what those boys might find out there.”

I heard one of their rocking chairs creak as they moved to stand up, so I quietly scurried back off to my room. My parents didn’t bring it up to me that night or ever, didn’t say anything about it at all. Likely fearful that I would have another “nightmare.”

The last day, Sunday afternoon, Mom and I did the laundry and packed our things. The packing didn’t take long. We left most of our stuff behind, seeing that we would be back next weekend. Once I had my little red and white polka dot duffle bag tucked in the trunk of her station wagon Mom told me I could play until we left in a couple of hours. I climbed my favorite tree, an oak near the back door that Dad had nailed wooden steps onto. Mom sat outside with me, folding laundry. I finished my Goosebumps book, so I examined my pockets and discovered a long screw. Lord know where I’d found it or why I’d picked it up but I decided it was time to carve my initials into a tree. 

Mom and I both heard the phone in the house ring, so she hopped up to get it. Probably Aunt Cheryl. She had been meaning to stop by that weekend but Mom had told her it wasn’t a great time. While carving an “A” from way up in the tree I saw Dad coming over from the shop barn. It was the largest of the barns, and Papa had used it as a workshop. From the shade of the enormous oak beside the barn, it looked like Dad had grabbed a rag, using it to wipe something on his shirt. As he stepped out into the light I could see that it was blood. Red, fresh.

Dad didn’t see me in the tree, so he didn't put on any heirs. He pulled his baseball cap off and wiped the sweat on his forehead with his arm. For a busy-body who normally took such long purposeful strides, his steps were slow. Heavy. His face was so white. His eyes were locked onto the ground in front of him as he walked. My dad looked scared. 

Mom tried to covertly put his dirty clothes in a bag while Dad showered and got changed. I didn’t say anything. Dad didn’t know I’d seen him, and Mom thought I was none the wiser. We turned off all the lights, locked all the doors, and then hit the road for home. Looking out my window at the lush greenery of the countryside that had so enamored me only days before, I couldn’t help but think now that it only acted as a shroud, a living, flowering veil that hid the beast lurking within. 

Back at home in the sardine can of suburbia, any moment absent of conscious thought was overcome with visions of the beast. If I had been any older, it would have been an easy write off, *“its just a nightmare,” “you’re crazy,” “go see a psychologist;”* but I wasn’t. I was an 8 year old little girl who read mythology encyclopedias and fairy tale compendiums like I was going for a PhD. I actively side stepped mushroom rings for fear of being kidnapped by the fae. A small piece of every Little Debbie cake I got was left near the crawl space door in case we had hobgoblins or brownies living under our house (which at the time, I seriously suspected we did).

My parents, the logic-bound adults could chock it all up to a subconscious presentation of a fear response, but I didn’t want to lie to myself.

I knew what I saw. 

As harrowing as it was, I kept mulling it over in my mind. Turning it over, rotating it at different angles, all in hopes of better understanding what it really was- the devil outside my bedroom window. If I was acting spacey, my friends at school didn’t say anything, at least not to my face. In the hallway, at lunch, at P.E. It possessed my every thought. 

The list of things I didn’t know about it was infinite, so I started with what I did know about it. 

It was large. Tall. I tried to think of it in comparison to the pines, and in doing so I stumbled upon a memory. It was a year before Nanny died, I was small, but not small enough to forget. It was the last time she was able to walk the pine rows with me. Her hair was as white as her sweet little farmhouse, and her bones burled and bent with age. Her voice was as gentle as the rustle in the pine needles. She said that because the pines were all planted so close together, the lowest of the branches wouldn’t get enough sunlight. As a result, they would drop off while the higher branches would reach upwards to take in more sunlight. I remember her smiling, as if that fact meant something to her.

She said that Papa had measured, and most of the branches in the pine rows were 5-7 feet from the ground. 

With that information at my disposal. I did some guesswork, but my safe guess was that it had been at least 4 feet, or probably more like 5 feet tall, on all fours.

It’s torso and appendages were lean. Not stocky, like a bear’s. Bears weren’t built that way. Why was I still thinking about bears? It definitely wasn’t a bear. What features I did see resembled a wolf, but wolves weren’t that large, that hairless, or that lanky. Neither were bears. My head began to throb. Whatever small annoying part of my brain *had* started developing was trying desperately to compare it to what I knew to be real. Thankfully the rest of my mind was fantastical and thought mermaids existed, so instead of having a psychological breakdown like an adult, I came to grips with the fact that this beast was a wolf-like and in all likelihood a werewolf. But I needed to do some research.  

That day after school, I asked Mom to take me to the library, a request she was used to. On the car ride there, she asked me what kind of book I was going to look for. So I explained my werewolf theory to her. A decision I immediately regretted when I saw the pity and concern within her eyes in the rear view mirror. 

“Honey, I know we’ve talked about all of this with the fairies and the mermaids and the unicorns, but werewolves aren’t real honey. I love that you have such a vivid imagination, but you’ve got to be realistic. I mean, sure, it might have been that bear or wolf out in the woods, but it was probably just a nightmare-“

“It couldn’t be a nightmare, I was at the window, and I know what I saw! It wasn’t normal looking- It didn’t look like a bear or a wolf, it was something else. I’m 100% sure that I saw what I saw! Mom, I swear- I swear I’m not lying.”

I saw the pained deliberation in her eyes. Outside of my fascination and proclivity for fairy stories I was pretty practical for my age. I listened to Mom and Dad when they told me things, I was forthcoming and honest if I did something I wasn’t supposed to. I wouldn’t blatantly lie to my Mom, and she knew that.

“Well, then, baby… if you really did see what you think you saw then- well, then it must have been a nightmare. And you’ve slept walked before! You know you were probably just sleep walking, had a nightmare, and woke at the window.”

My brow furrowed, taking what my mom said into consideration but not able to convince myself. I stared out the window in deep thought until we pulled up to the library.

Once we arrived, I didn’t have to worry about trying to give my Mom the slip. My love of books and stories came from her, and she made a B-line for the mystery section. Despite her dismissal of my werewolf theory, she loved spooky stories. 

  After collecting a few books from the sections labeled “folklore” and “nature science,” I found an empty table and started to read. I skimmed through a couple of books on mythology and American folklore and the like, none of its pages revealing any groundbreaking revelations. Silver bullets, transformation under the light of the moon, all the usual factoids. What was highly informative, however, was the expository book on wolves. 

How fast they were, how much power and stamina they possessed, how strong their bite was, how sharp their eyes were, how keen their sense of smell was; all the things that made them great hunters. I kept in mind that this was all a baseline for this creature. At the *very least* it did all these things. The thought overcame me with dread. I didn’t exactly calculate the metrics, but I knew that this monster likely doubled if not tripled anything a wolf could do. 

Knowing that time was running out before Mom came to fetch me, I ran over to the children’s section and grabbed a Junie B. Jones book I hadn’t read yet, as well as the newest Goosebumps book.

When I approached Mom, I tried to hide my wolf book under my selection of age appropriate literature, but Lori didn’t miss a thing.

“Study of the American Wolf, huh?”

I tried to brush past her comment and critical side eye,

“I thought you said I needed to be more realistic. Wolves are real, aren’t they?”

She sighed, rolling her eyes, handing it and my other books over to the librarian for check out. 

That evening at home, we had finished dinner and cleared the dining room table to play Jenga. The phone rang, and Dad stepped out of the room and into the kitchen to take it. Dad answered in a hushed tone, keeping his voice down. Unfortunately for Dad, he wasn’t a great whisperer. 

“Hey Dan… find any-?…How many…?” 

Silence. For a long while, silence. Mom and I locked eyes.

“God… Yeah, I see. Thank the boys for me… I’ll pay em for all their help… we both know that’s a lot of work. So sorry they had to… yeah… well… my God… I don’t know either, man… Yeah… Yeah… Thanks again Dan.”

Dad returned, doing his best to hide the weary look on his face. He glanced over at my Mom, and then at me, giving me a smile. I smiled back timidly. 

I looked back and forth between Mom and Dad, as she gave him a look that said, *‘You know she heard all that, right?’*

Dad hummed, pursing his lips in a wry way. I couldn’t help but laugh at him. But the quiet that followed it sobered the moment.

""Amy,” My Dad paused as he weighed his words. “Your old man… is an awful whisperer.”

“Yeah, you kind of are.” I snickered.

“I know you’re a smart girl, even if you didn’t just hear me on the phone, I know that you know that some scary stuff is going on right now.”

I nodded. Dad sat back down at the table, folding his hands as he spoke.

“But I want you to know that while we’re at the farm, you aren’t in any danger as long as you listen to what your mother and I say. Follow the rules, stay in the yard, and don’t go into the pine rows. I don’t want this to cause you too much distress, because none of this is going to last forever. 

Mr Voss, myself and some other people in the community are getting evidence together, and filling paperwork out- which is stupid- but we are doing it to see if we can get the game warden or someone from DNR involved. Whoever ends up helping us, they will know what to do. Its their job, that my taxes pay for by the way, and the fact that they haven’t sent someone out already is-“

Mom kicked Dad under the table. Dad cleared his throat. 

“The point is, whatever this thing is, a bear, a wolf, its just wandered too far out of its habitat. Whenever someone from the state *does* get out there, they’ll either capture it or kill it or do whatever they have to to keep people safe, to keep us safe.” 

I nodded again with a small smile. I thought it was sweet that Mom and Dad were trying to keep my spirits up, especially when I could tell all of this weighed on them so heavily. 

I tried to lighten the mood a little bit, the way any 8 year old girl would, by being a little snarky.

“So, what will we do if the game warden looks at everything and says its a werewolf?” I said. 

To me it was only kind of a joke, but to Mom and Dad it was ridiculous, and that was all that mattered. Dad smirked.

“Ah yes, your mother told me all about your werewolf theory.”

“Well, what if it is?” I crossed my arms, making a face that wrinkled my nose.

Dad put on a gravely serious look, laying it on thick. 

“If it is, I’ll just have to melt down your mother’s silver dinnerware set into bullets.”

“Oh no you won’t! That set is an heirloom!” 

Dad dramatically lifted his hands, dropping them back down on the table in defeat.

“Well then, I guess your mother is just going to let us all die,”

Mom and I cracked up. Dad attempted to remain dry but the corners of his mouth crept up into a smile. 

“We’ll just have to try and stab the thing with silver butter knives. That’ll show ‘em.”

We cut-up for the rest of the evening, our hearts full of mirth as we turned in for the night. None of us spoke about it again for the rest of the week. But it festered in our minds, leaked into every unoccupied moment. I could see the apprehension buried in their eyes when they were lost in thought, driving, cooking dinner, staring out the window. I lied awake in bed every night, counting down the days until Friday, when we returned to the farm.

Suddenly this week he calls me like it is nothing and says hey, you are closer to the school than us, it would be easier if Nina stayed with you on weekdays. Not stayed like one afternoon. He meant Monday to Friday. A whole human. In my 1 bedroom apartment. With my plants. And my peace.

I asked him why on earth he thought that made sense and he literally said ""you dont have kids so you are more flexible"". No, I dont have kids because I didnt want to organize my entire day around tiny people. That is the point. He started telling me how early they have to wake up to drive her and how tired they are and how they cant afford a nanny right now. I get it, life with kids is hard. But why do they think the solution is to hand me the kid like she is a parcel because I once said I like her. I like croissants too, doesnt mean I want a bakery in my living room.

My income is not bad, but it’s pretty unstable (freelancing in a volatile niche; I am currently working at a career pivot that should, hopefully, land me a stable job in a better market, but that pivot is likely take at least a year or so). In the meantime, I know I spend a little too much money on stuff like, you know, UberEats, grocery delivery while I could just walk to the nearest supermarket in mere 25 minutes, coffee-and-pastry outings that are a tad too frequent, buying pretty hardbacks while, in practice, I usually read ebooks… this kind of thing. 

So, I am not going cold turkey on all that (except for grocery deliveries and takeouts, unless I’m very sick), but I am setting firm boundaries with how much I’m allowed to spend on these things per month (all in separate categories).

I am tall, reasonably fit, and grew up in the Middle East. I am from a conservative developing country. A few years ago I worked at a company there and built a solid reputation. On a visit back to the office after I left, I noticed a very cute woman but I was moving back to the Middle East, so I did not make a move.

Fast forward 2 to 3 years. I work remotely now. I reached out to a colleague I had never spoken to about a project and realized she is the same woman I saw back home. At first I did not think much of it.

We started collaborating. Most of our communication is by phone. Early on she kept personal stuff light, but we talked about normal work chatter. Other teammates noticed she helps me a lot and teased her about it. (She told me that)
Lately when I call for work, we end up talking for 3 to 4 hours about our backgrounds and interests. She is very busy but still tries to make time for me.

I am starting to fall for her. We have similar interests and values. She is tall by our country’s standards and checks many boxes for me.

Concern. We work at the same company. If she is not into me or if this becomes gossip, it could be awkward and bad for me. We also do not live in the same country right now, so a casual coffee is not possible. I will be visiting my home country in about 2 to 3 months.

My questions. Should I wait until I visit to ask her out, or should I test the waters now in a low pressure way? If now, how do i test the waters? ",2,1761910664.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

July 2025 to October 2025

I already did a lot of food fasting prior to the semaglutide shots but started looking at the little things I was eating that would have been contributing to weight gain. I found out a large iced coffee 5 to 6 times a week was really setting my sugar levels 3 to 4x the amount an average women was supposed to have in a week. So I stopped completely and will have a small ice coffee here and there as a treat but a basic coffee not the fancy sugary ones 😊.

Had my 3rd daughter Jan. 2025 and couldn't stand seeing my belly with high waist pants as I looked like a snowman 😂. I drink way more water and carry a big tumbler with me to avoid quick store drinks. More chicken and less packaged food.

You would think after losing almost 30lbs my clothes would be baggy but it made me realize I was tricking myself into a certain size for awhile. Hence the feeling like a snowman ⛄. 


I went through goodlifemeds for compound semaglutide and first payment was $197 then second vial at $299. I just started on the second vial and will be on my 4 month next Wednesday.

I will say I'm doing this mostly to get my belly back to its form but I'm not really going for a weight number. I'm going for how I feel and what makes me the happiest when I start my day and get dressed.",18,1761910571.0,Semaglutide,0,1.0,False

He told me he was recently going through a divorce  (his wife of 20 years cheated on him).  Fast forward two months after a lot of talking and banter and he wants to meet.  We get coffee together and had a great time and there was chemistry.  He was pretty open about not being serious because he was going through a divorce and I was ok with that because I had a lot of work to do on myself, and I enjoyed his company and didn’t really see myself as being in a place to be in a relationship yet.   

Fast forward again a couple months and we catch feelings for each other.  I tell him I want to at least try to have more kids and we won’t be compatible unless he wants that too and he tells me he’s open to it.  I’m super happy that I’ve found someone to potentially share my life with, and fulfill my desire to become a mother again (I have a son, who is my light and my life but I always wanted more kids.  Pregnancy and being a mom was something that made me thrive, it cured my inky black and skeptical heart, and I was a literal goddess while I was pregnant.  I created life!  I have never in any role besides being a mom and I’ve been chasing that high ever since)

Fast forward a few more months of dating and we’re officially together.  His wife knows about me, Ive met her and everything.  I go to his family functions.  He talks about our future together.  We make plans to live together.  

Then he gives me some heartbreaking news… a year into our relationship and he doesn’t want more kids.  It’s a hard no for him. 

I go through a period of cognitive dissonance.  I love this man but he took my autonomy away.  I’m not exactly a “spring chicken” and I don’t have a lot of time to try to have babies so I have to choose between the future I had been hoping for vs. a future with him.  I loved him but I was upset, and when trying to talk to him what he said was “I’m allowed to change my mind” and didn’t seem to care about how heartbroken I was about this.  As if this wasn’t about something that he knew I wanted, and approached him and really bared my soul to him before we were serious.

I was/am still seriously heart broken about that.  If he had told me he didn’t want kids when I approached him about it, I could’ve made the decision to give up that future and continue pursuing a relationship with him, or follow what I knew I wanted and invested my heart elsewhere.  But he took that choice away from me. 

So after I wrestle with this tragic news, I still choose him.  My friends all called him my green flag boyfriend because he treated me so well (but I may have hyped him up to them).  We make plans for a vacation.  I wanted to show him my most happiest place on the planet.  We plan it six months in the future.  June comes fast, the month we had planned on going on a vacation.  He spends the week before on a vacation that he hadn’t informed me of, it was with his wife and kids.

I’m like, ok whatever 🤷‍♀️ he’s trying to be a good coparent.  But a few days before our vacation he informs me that he has to work because he has some projects he needs to finish.  

I guess this is where I’m the asshole.  I’m upset but I don’t tell him.  I make assumptions that he prioritized his vacation with his wife and family and put off work for our vacation.  It makes me feel like I’m not a priority to him, and this vacation that I had planned with him half a year in advance so he could also make plans for simply wasn’t as important to him as it was to me.

I brought up these feelings to him after the fact.   I also think I need to mention that he makes a lot more money than I do.  I have a good career and I’ve worked hard to be in the place that I am.  It still doesn’t feel like enough to live on and I’m barely making ends meet.   He hasn’t given me an honest number but he has a second property in Hawaii that costs him $10k/month, and that’s more than I make in a month.  So I can only assume if that’s his extra income then he makes much much more than me.  

So… He spent our vacation that I paid half of working, and when I brought up how upset I felt about that he said that I was the asshole for not trusting him, that he needed to work or else he would be fired.  

But I lost wages to go on this vacation, and I still payed for half…. actually more than half because he didn’t offer to help with groceries or meals or take out, although he did pay for some dinners and lunches, and he only split gas on the way home, and I paid for the hotel for the half way point for the drive there, and all of the activities and excursions we went on which included deep sea fishing, whale watching, factory tours etc… which came to at least as much as hotel and gas.  But I didn’t say anything or even expect for him to pay because these were things that I wanted to share with him.  I really didn’t expect him to pay for those things.  

It just really upsets me that he worked for a vacation that I had made a huge effort for.  I can’t work remotely with my job and just had to absorb the lost wages while he worked and didn’t even pay for half of the expenses.  AND I know he paid 100% for his vacation with his ex and kids the week before.  And he doesn’t seem to see why I would be upset.

Also,  I brought up that he’s going through a divorce with his ex because at this point we had been dating for a year and a half and he still had yet to file for divorce.  It just made me feel like he has a life partner who was fulfilling his wife and family duties, while using me for emotional and sexual purposes, which would be fine if he laid that out for me instead of roping me into this idea of a future together, even asking me to move out of state with him and totally uprooting mine and my sons life.

Typically we put the Taro in the milk and steam it together using a standard milk steamer, same as you'd use to make a cappuccino.

Would it be fine to boil them together over medium/low heat? Would it burn? Would anything happen to the flavor? Any tips?

I’ve been a nurse for five years, and I’ve always been the kind who avoids conflict. I go above and beyond for my patients — I never argue, belittle, or act mean. Many of my colleagues and patients know me as the nurse who can calm down an angry patient with a bit of sweet talk.
But lately, I’ve been feeling so drained watching people abuse the free healthcare system. Some come to the hospital repeatedly and then refuse most of the treatments the doctors recommend. Others get upset over the smallest things — their coffee isn’t hot enough, the kitchen forgot an item, or their bed isn’t made fast enough.

Recently, I lost my patience with a man who demanded a banana while I was about to start my medication rounds. We didn’t have any on the ward, and the main kitchen was all the way downstairs. He felt entitled because he’d ordered it the day before, but it wasn’t on his tray. Soon after, his blood pressure dropped, so I asked him to lie down so I could reassess him. Instead, he argued that I should make him coffee first. I told him his health takes priority over comfort, but he kept arguing. At that point, I gave up — it was clear he wasn’t interested in helping himself and he's not for a code.

All I really want is to learn how to politely but firmly tell patients like that to back off, without getting in trouble. I’m just tired of being treated like a maid instead of a nurse.",14,1761909844.0,nursing,6,0.85,False

[Mines and mineral projects generate economic and employment opportunities across Alaska.](https://preview.redd.it/0ynckjev7fyf1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=afeb70b4b1ae97380b40861a4ede561d9946125b)

# Backing from the Pentagon, White House, and Capitol Hill, coupled with soaring metals prices, is fueling new growth for the sector.

With the price of copper, gold, and silver hitting new all-time highs, the Pentagon looking North for secure supplies of critical minerals, and a White House administration focused on unleashing the resource potential of America's Last Frontier, the mining sector in Alaska has reached critical mass in 2025.

While Alaska's mining industry has been building toward critical mass for decades, the 2024 election started a reaction that could sustain sector growth over the coming decade.

This chain reaction is visible across the state: in the Ambler Mining District, where a road reauthorized by the Trump administration is opening the metals-rich region for development and exploration; at Graphite Creek near Nome, an Alaska Native– and federally-backed mine project that will help break America's dependence on China for graphite, the largest ingredient in lithium-ion batteries; and in the emerging West Susitna Mining District, where a high-grade antimony project backed by the Pentagon is establishing a cornerstone for further development of this Southcentral region enriched with millions of ounces of gold and billions of pounds of copper.

The significance of Alaska's mineral wealth and strategic Arctic location is now a headlining topic of national conversation – from the Pentagon to the White House and Capitol Hill.

""Strategically, Alaska is one of the most important states for our nation, with its location, minerals, land, and natural resource assets,"" Congressman Pete Stauber (R-Minn.) said during an August tour of Alaska with his colleagues on the House Natural Resources Committee.

And as federal policies help catalyze the development of key resource regions, record-breaking metal prices are adding another surge of energy to world-class, though often remote, mining projects across Alaska. This is especially true for Donlin Gold, where soaring prices and a newly motivated partner are providing the impetus to develop a million-ounce-per-year mine decades in the making.

This pipeline of federally-backed and market-supported projects is building on an already growing mining sector in Alaska, which is on pace to deliver more than $5 billion worth of gold, silver, zinc, lead, and coal this year.

# Unleashing Alaska's extraordinary potential

During a September U.S. Senate hearing on ""Unleashing Alaska's Extraordinary Resource Potential,"" Alaska Miners Association (AMA) Executive Director Deantha Skibinski highlighted the critical role the mining sector plays in the state's economy and the policies needed to ensure Alaska's resources contribute to America's mineral security.

""Mines are critical to Alaska's economy and have proven environmental and safety track records,"" Skibinski told the House Committee on Natural Resources' Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. ""Unfortunately, they are frequently targeted by outside opposition groups that spread misinformation to stir public fear and overwhelm the regulatory agencies responsible for managing the nation's permitting process.""

She noted that Alaska's mining sector already contributes substantially to the state's economy, including:

• $1.8 billion spent on goods and services to support Alaska's mines, with $1.1 billion directly to Alaska businesses.

• $145 million paid in local and state government revenues.

• $240 million in royalty payments to Alaska Native corporations, bringing the cumulative total to $3.6 billion since 1989.

• 12,400 total direct, indirect, and induced jobs by the mining sector, paying an average wage of $123,000 – twice the state average for all other employment sectors.

These benefits are generated from seven large and approximately 300 small-scale placer mining operations that produce gold, silver, zinc, lead, germanium, and coal.

Projects enriched with antimony, barite, cobalt, copper, gallium, graphite, rare earths, and other critical minerals could help sustain the critical mass being achieved by Alaska's mining sector – further contributing to the state's economy and the nation's mineral independence.

""Alaska is an extraordinary state with the ability to significantly contribute to our country's prosperity,"" Skibinski testified.

# Reinstating the Ambler Road

The first signs that Alaska's mining industry had the potential to achieve critical mass came a year ago, when Donald Trump vowed that his administration ""will maximize Alaska's mining potential"" the day after his re-election was confirmed.

He followed through on that promise with the ""Unleashing Alaska's Extraordinary Resource Potential"" executive order, signed on his first day back in office.

Among the most consequential moves was reinstating permits for the 211-mile Ambler Road, providing long-awaited access to the most valuable undeveloped mining districts in the U.S.

""This is one of the richest copper locations in the country,"" said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.

Access to the Ambler District was mandated in the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), yet 2020 authorizations to build the road were revoked by the Biden administration.

""The Biden administration decision was contrary to the clear directives set out in ANILCA,"" said Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse, chairman of Valhalla Metals, a company exploring the high-grade Sun copper-zinc-lead-gold-silver project along the Ambler Road route.

On Oct. 6, Trump signed an executive order directing the federal agencies to reinstate the authorizations to build a road to three high-grade deposits and dozens of earlier-staged prospects discovered across the mineral-rich region.

""Now we're starting again – and this time we have plenty of time to get it done, and it's going to be done properly,"" the president said upon signing the Ambler Road order.

The road will provide access to high-grade deposits enriched with more than 9 billion pounds of copper and 3 billion lb of zinc, along with significant quantities of silver, gold, lead, cobalt, gallium, and germanium.

""It's an economic gold mine, so to speak,"" said Trump.

Companies that have idled exploration and development in the district due to a lack of access are looking to resume programs with the reissuance of Ambler Road permits.

""Thank you, President Trump! We can now restart our exploration efforts to expand the known resources at the Sun deposit,"" said Van Nieuwenhuyse.

In response to a question on the timing of the road, Trump says the government anticipates that construction will begin next spring.

""So, we get a road done, and with that, we unleash billions and billions of dollars of wealth,"" he said.

# Pentagon invests in the North

On the same day Trump reinstated the Ambler Road permits, the Pentagon invested $35.6 million to acquire a 10% ownership stake in Trilogy Metals Inc., which is advancing Ambler District mine development in partnership with South32 Ltd.

Ambler Metals, the joint venture owned equally by Trilogy and South32, holds a 471,800-acre package of state mining claims and Alaska Native lands owned by NANA Corp. in the district.

Arctic and Bornite, the two most advanced deposits, collectively host 9 billion lb of copper, 3.5 billion lb of zinc, 88 million lb of cobalt, 57 million oz of silver, and 737,000 oz of gold in all resource categories.

Arctic, the first Upper Kobuk Mineral Project (UKMP) deposit to be developed, is slated to produce 1.9 billion lb of copper, 2.3 billion lb of zinc, 388 million lb of lead, 386,000 ounces of gold, and 40.6 million oz of silver over an initial 12-year mine life, according to a feasibility study published in 2022.

Bornite, which is about 16 miles south of Arctic, is expected to produce an additional 1.9 billion lb of copper over 17 years after the completion of mining at Arctic, according to a preliminary economic assessment completed earlier this year.

Bornite may also be a significant source of germanium, a critical metal essential for smaller, more powerful semiconductors used in quantum computing, robotics, AI, and solar-powered satellites.

With the Ambler Road reauthorized, the JV is preparing to move forward with permitting and development.

""The Ambler Mining District is ready to play a vital role in supporting America's strategic and technological leadership,"" said Trilogy Metals President and CEO Tony Giardini.

As part of the buy-in deal, the U.S. government is working with Trilogy, South32, and others to establish the basis on which the Ambler Road can be permitted, financed, and constructed.

""This is a really big deal for the American mining industry, and I think it shows the president is serious about getting this industry going and making sure we have the critical minerals we need for our defense industrial base and for our broader economy,"" said Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

The Pentagon's investment in the Ambler District is part of a broader initiative that includes strong federal support for Graphite One Inc. and Nova Minerals Ltd., both developing domestic sources of minerals critical to defense and clean energy supply chains in the U.S.

[A $35.6 million grant from the Pentagon accelerated Graphite One's ability to complete the drilling and other work needed to advance the world-class Graphite Creek project in western Alaska to permitting.](https://preview.redd.it/frnts6n58fyf1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d557de57596071a8170240306fdfc62c7cf6c38)

# Federal support for Graphite One

In 2023, the Pentagon began what is turning out to be an all-of-government federal support for Graphite One when it provided the company with a $37.5 million Defense Production Act (DPA) Title III grant to accelerate the completion of feasibility studies for developing a mine at the Graphite Creek project in western Alaska – home to the largest and one of the most advanced graphite deposits in the U.S.

The work supported by this funding culminated in a feasibility study that details an economically robust mine at Graphite Creek capable of producing 175,000 metric tons of graphite annually for 20 years, as well as a processing plant in Ohio that will refine the concentrates shipped from the Alaska mine to anode material for lithium-ion batteries and other commercial graphite products.

With the Pentagon grant accelerating Graphite Creek to the feasibility stage, other federal agencies have now stepped up to carry that momentum through permitting and mine development.

Earlier this year, Graphite Creek was approved for streamlined permitting under the federal FAST-41 program.

""Graphite Creek is critical to achieving President Trump's energy dominance agenda and is exactly the kind of project that can benefit from the transparency and accountability that comes with FAST-41,"" said Emily Domenech, executive director of the federal Permitting Council, which administers the program.

After coordinating with the federal agencies involved in permitting Graphite Creek, the Permitting Council outlined a 13.5-month permitting timeline, putting the project on track for a federal permitting decision in September of next year.

With the permits for the Graphite Creek expected in about a year, the Export‑Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) has invited Graphite One to apply for a $570 million loan to build a mine at the western Alaska project.

If approved, the loan would cover a little over half of the estimated $1.1 billion needed to build a mine at Graphite Creek.

Graphite One President and CEO Anthony Huston says the federal support for Graphite Creek, ""underscores the U.S. government's keen understanding of the urgency to end the United States' 100% dependence of foreign sources of graphite supply.""

[The U.S. War Department awarded Alaska Range Resources $43.4 million to produce antimony in Alaska.](https://preview.redd.it/gopm2ace8fyf1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dad602680154a499d96df743f77ee7666ffe117)

Pentagon backs Alaska antimony

In addition to its support for Trilogy and Graphite One, the Pentagon has awarded Alaska Range Resources (ARR), a subsidiary of Nova Minerals, $43.4 million to produce military-grade antimony trisulfide in Alaska.

""Antimony metal and antimony trisulfide have critical applications in munitions, especially low- and medium-caliber, where it is used in primer production and case hardening,"" said Assistant Secretary of War for Industrial Base Policy Mike Cadenazzi.

While antimony has long been a strategic metalloid to the War Department, China's 2024 ban on exporting antimony to the U.S., coupled with Russia's war with Ukraine, has elevated its criticality.

This is because China, Russia, and Tajikistan control more than 90% of the global supply, leaving American manufacturers with limited alternatives for the more than 50 million pounds of antimony they require each year for a wide range of defense, industrial, and high-tech applications.

""China and Russia control the market for antimony and all its derivatives, putting the United States at risk of interruptions that could jeopardize national security,"" said Jeffrey Frankston, acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of War for Industrial Base Resilience. ""Establishing domestic sources for critical metals and minerals like antimony and its compounds enhances the long-term resilience of our supply chains.""

Pentagon officials are increasingly looking to Alaska as America's antimony supply, including the DPA Title III award to mine the antimony mineral stibnite from Nova's Estelle project about 100 miles west of Anchorage and refine that material into military-grade antimony trisulfide in Alaska.

Upon receiving the award, ARR signed a land use agreement with the Matanuska-Susitna Borough for the site that is less than two miles away from a deepwater port to build its Alaska antimony refinery.

""The planned refinery development in the Port MacKenzie industrial district is a cornerstone of a vertically integrated domestic antimony supply chain,"" said Nova Minerals CEO Chris Gerteisen. ""The Port Mac site has immediate access to key infrastructure and utilities.""

With the refinery site secure and progress being made toward establishing a small but supply chain-significant mine at Estelle, Nova has its sights set on delivering refined antimony products into the U.S. supply chain by 2027.

""Backed by strong government support, strategic partnerships, a highly capable leadership team, and land secured to commence construction of a downstream refinery, Nova holds a commanding first-mover advantage as the sole emerging fully integrated antimony producer and supplier to the U.S. military and domestic markets,"" the Nova Minerals CEO added.

# Metals policies, prices converge

The surge in federal support for Alaska mining projects coincides with a historic bull market in metals, adding fuel to the building momentum for mining across the Last Frontier.

Gold, silver, and copper – three pillars of the current value and future growth for Alaska mining – have all reached record levels in 2025.

Gold has soared roughly 55% since the beginning of the year, breaching $4,100 per ounce amid safehaven buying and inflation pressures. Silver has rocketed 62% this year, to around $50 per ounce, fueled by industrial demand and investor speculation.

Copper, the essential metal of electrification, hit an all-time high of $5.82 per pound before stabilizing near $5 – a price that supports both mine expansion and new development. Antimony, propelled by supply shocks and defense demand, has surged more than 500% over two years to about $27 per pound.

These are likely not short-term spikes but signs of a structural realignment of global metals markets – one where Alaska's resources are increasingly central to both U.S. economic policy and industrial strategy.

Projects like Donlin Gold, Graphite Creek, Ambler Metals, and Estelle are building on the foundation of Alaska's current $5 billion mining industry, opening the door for a larger pipeline of production that could redefine Alaska's role in the nation's mineral independence.

With the Pentagon, the White House, and private investors aligned in the pursuit of mineral security, Alaska's mining industry appears to have achieved the critical mass it has been building for decades – an inflection point where policy, price, and potential have finally converged.

Keeping the momentum going, however, will be up to Alaska's mining sector and the people behind it.

""It is now up to us Alaskans to execute a strategy of energy and mineral self-sufficiency while maintaining our high standards to protect our people and our environment – something that we have a demonstrated track record of achieving,"" Van Nieuwenhuyse told North of 60 Mining News.

# Oct. 31st, 2025~Mr. President, We Need an America First Critical Minerals Strategy

[Mr. President, We Need an America First Critical Minerals Strategy | RealClearDefense](https://www.realcleardefense.com/2025/10/31/mr_president_we_need_an_america_first_critical_minerals_strategy_1144510.html)

[Perpetua Resources](https://preview.redd.it/jmv2ii5z8fyf1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fc1ab05e4092fa46ccb6e61bd179af1657040f5)

President Trump just met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at this month’s APEC Summit in Seoul, South Korea. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also met with their counterparts. These will be some of the most important meetings of President Trump’s second term in office. The Trump Administration should give the President the strongest negotiating hand possible by arming him ahead of time with a whole-of-government National Critical Minerals Strategy.

We are retired two-star military leaders who dedicated our adult lives to defending our homeland. We can tell you without any doubt that critical minerals are not just an economic issue or an environmental issue–but a national security crisis. 

For example, the critical mineral [antimony](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/antimony-statistics-and-information) is especially important to our warfighters. It is used in every bullet, every pair of night-vision goggles, and in the starter battery of everything that floats, flies, or drives, from every howitzer to every stealth bomber. Without it, our military would simply shut down. Yet right now, China controls [nearly half](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/what-is-antimony-why-is-china-curbing-its-exports-2024-08-16/) of the world’s antimony supply and most of its processing.

Until a year ago, the United States and our allies depended on China for antimony. But after the President’s re-election, China cut America off and drove up our prices, [sending us scrambling](https://www.responsiblebatterycoalition.org/news/battery-makers-sweat-as-antimony-shortage-hits-after-chinas-export-curbs-reuters) to find other overseas suppliers. It is only a matter of time before China runs the same playbook with other critical minerals too: through its imperialistic Belt and Road Initiative, China controls[ 70 percent](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/us-rare-earth-chokepoint-is-big-little-problem-2025-10-13/#:~:text=China%20controls%20most%20of%20the,Guilford;%20Production%20by%20Maya%20Nandhini) of the world’s rare earth elements production. In the critical minerals category, they control two-thirds of the world’s lithium and three-quarters of the world’s cobalt.

But these numbers *under*state China’s dominance: China controls an even greater share of critical mineral *processing and refining*. Without processing ability, all the minerals in the world will be of no use. By cornering the market on mineral processing, China can hold the rest of the world hostage.

Fortunately, the Trump Administration is aware of this problem and has been taking action to the point that CNN even suggested the President was “[obsessed](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/08/climate/deep-sea-mining-critical-minerals)” with critical minerals earlier this year. In January, the Department of the Interior finally approved the application to reopen America’s only antimony mine in [Central Idaho](https://www.heritage.org/trade/commentary/critical-mineral-critical-moment-the-antimony-crisis). This is excellent news, but it is not enough to ensure America’s antimony independence. 

Getting the mine up and running after 20 years of closure will take time. But even if the Idaho mine switched back on at full capacity tomorrow, we wouldn’t be able to process and purify the antimony it produces. As a result, American antimony would end up getting sent to China for processing and then sent back here at a higher price. As America begins to mine again, we also need to process again to take full control of the supply chain.

America needs a whole-of-government National Critical Mineral Strategy that includes fast-tracking of regulatory approvals for mining projects, such as construction permits and operating permits. The Administration has largely done this already through its National Energy Emergency, but it must also include the same regulatory relief for mineral processing facilities.

The second Trump Administration has been the most aggressive Presidential administration on the issue of trade in decades, if not ever. The Administration should ensure strong anti-dumping rules to ensure that China does not bankrupt our mining companies or our mineral processors.

Securing America’s critical mineral independence will take time. But until then, if we cannot reshore a mineral, then we should friend-shore it. President Trump should coordinate an international antimony supply and processing capacity with our allies until we can become a net mineral exporter. We should never depend on an adversary for something so basic and necessary as antimony to make bullets. These minerals ensure our national security, thriving economy and with that our leadership on the world stage. 

Even when America does get back to mining and processing antimony as we did in World War II, there will still be the threat of China attempting to bankrupt our companies. China has run the same playbook over and over again in our country and in other countries around the world: subsidize their own products to drop prices below cost for their competitors and then dump their cheap commodities in our market. The result is that their competitors, our domestic manufacturers, go bankrupt and China is able to dominate the market completely. Any National Critical Minerals Strategy needs to prepare for this and ensure that China doesn’t do to our miners and manufacturers what they did to our steelworkers. 

Fortunately, Secretary Bessent said recently that the Administration will protect against Chinese dumping by instituting [price floors](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/15/trump-xi-china-bessent-price-floor-rare-earth-critical-mineral.html) to keep our most important institutions in business. As the Secretary put it with regard to rare earths, “either we have to be self-sufficient, or we have to be sufficient with our allies.”

The President’s meeting with President Xi is their first since 2019 and it could have implications for the next four years and beyond. We urge the President to continue his pressure campaign for fair trade while at the same time ensuring America and our allies can deliver the minerals we need for a modern economy and a lethal military. This is our moment to declare critical mineral independence.

# Oct. 15th 2025 ~Trump administration will set price floors across range of industries to combat China, Bessent says

[Trump will set price floors across industries to combat China, Bessent says](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/15/trump-xi-china-bessent-price-floor-rare-earth-critical-mineral.html)

* The U.S. has to use industrial policy to compete against nonmarket economies like China, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC.
* The Trump administration will set price floors across a range of strategic industries to combat Beijing, Bessent said.
* The administration could take equity stakes in more companies in the wake of China’s new restrictions on rare earth exports, he said.

https://preview.redd.it/ok2jtkv2nfyf1.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=4aa5c24699dad679c65be8366483a928d089defa

The Trump administration will set price floors across a range of industries to combat market manipulation by China, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC in an exclusive interview Wednesday.

China has driven foreign competitors in the rare earth industry out of business over the past two decades by using its [global dominance](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/14/china-trump-xi-rare-earth-defense-critical-mineral-trade-war-tariffs.html) in refining and processing to slash prices, Bessent said.

“When you are facing a nonmarket economy like China, then you have to exercise industrial policy,” Bessent told [Sara Eisen](https://www.cnbc.com/sara-eisen/) at CNBC’s Invest in America Forum in Washington, D.C.

“So we’re going to set price floors and the forward buying to make sure that this doesn’t happen again and we’re going to do it across a range of industries,” the Treasury secretary said, without naming specific industries the administration was looking at beyond rare earths.

The U.S. also needs to set up a strategic mineral reserve, Bessent said. [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM/) is interested in working with the Trump administration to create such a reserve, he said.

Rare earths are used to produce magnets that are crucial inputs in U.S. weapons systems like the F-35 warplane and Tomahawk cruise missiles. Rare earth magnets are also essential for civilian commercial applications like electric vehicles.

The Trump administration has been working to stand up a domestic rare earth supply chain. The Department of Defense struck an [unprecedented deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html) in July with [MP Materials,](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MP/) the largest U.S. rare earth miner, that included an equity stake, a price floor and offtake agreement.

China last week announced sweeping new restrictions on rare earth exports ahead of an expected meeting between President [Xi Jinping](https://www.cnbc.com/xi-jinping/) and President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) in South Korea later this month. Trump has threatened to slap China with additional 100% tariffs in response.

The U.S. could take equity stakes in other companies in the wake of Beijing’s rare earth restrictions, Bessent told CNBC.

“I wouldn’t be surprised,” the Treasury secretary said when asked about additional equity stakes. “When we get an announcement like this week with China on the rare earths, you realize we have to be self-sufficient, or we have to be sufficient with our allies.”

The Trump administration will not take stakes in nonstrategic industries, Bessent said. “We do have to be very careful not to overreach,” he said.

Shares of rare earth and critical mineral miners have rallied over the past several sessions as investors speculate on which companies might be future targets for Trump administration industrial policy.



# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ⚡ Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance** → Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition** → Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts** → 2025 drilling added **9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)** plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

I wrote a post earlier in this sub about my first-day experience taking magnesium glycinate and here is my follow up review 4 days later.

After four days of taking magnesium glycinate, last night brought the most remarkable results yet. I experienced the same relaxed thought patterns and loosened muscles as before, calm but not sedated, just as I had during the first three days.

What was new, for the first time in a very long time, was that I fell asleep easily, no racing thoughts, no tension and I slept straight through the night. I had vivid dreams, which makes me think I finally restored my REM sleep cycle.

I woke up at 5 a.m. feeling completely rested. Honestly, it shocked me I literally felt like a different person. When I checked the time, I was confused because I felt so refreshed instead of groggy or wired. I slept 9 hours straight. Typically I’m lucky if I get in 6 hours, so this is a huge jump for me.

One thing I also noticed (and this happened both the first night I took it and again today) is that I felt like I was going to have diarrhea. I did end up going once in the morning, but it wasn’t severe. For context, I have Graves’ disease and had some coffee both days, so that may have contributed. Still, I actually take it as a sign that the magnesium is really working and not just a placebo, it’s definitely doing something physiologically noticeable.

Overall, this has been such a positive change for me. I haven’t felt this calm, rested, or energized in a long time, and I’m genuinely hopeful about what continued magnesium support might do for my recovery long term.",1,1761909244.0,Supplements,2,0.67,False

I’d like to exchange some thoughts with you and find out whether my symptoms are typical and comparable to yours.

Years ago, I saw several doctors, including angiologists, who ran many tests. At that time, they already suspected **primary Raynaud’s syndrome**, but no one ever mentioned calcium channel blockers. Thanks to this sub-forum, I recently learned about them and decided to try **Amlodipine 10 mg** – more on that below.

As I can see from my tests, an ""ANA Test"" wasnt made. 

# Symptoms

* Cold hands and feet almost all day long, even indoors at 21–22°C.
* During exercise, my hands usually stay cold; at least my feet warm up a bit while running.
* When it’s around 20°C or warmer outside, my hands and feet feel more or less normal, or at least not uncomfortably cold. But as soon as the temperature drops, it becomes increasingly problematic.

Regular gloves only work down to around 10°C — some warmth still comes from the wrist area. Once it’s colder than that, gloves seem to trap each finger’s remaining heat separately, my hands start sweating slightly, and then they cool down completely.



So, is Raynaud’s typically characterized by **sudden attacks** where the fingers turn white, painful, or numb?  
In my case, my hands and feet are **constantly cold** — not in short attacks. Outdoors, they get progressively colder until the pain becomes really strong.

I used to cycle 20 minutes to work every day, and every time I arrived, my hands would hurt intensely as they warmed up again.



For context: I’m **male, in my early 30s**, and I exercise about **5–10 hours a week** (mainly running and road cycling).  
My **blood pressure is normal**, and my **blood tests are fine**, except for red blood parameters, which are at the **lower limit** of the normal range.

I’ve been taking **Amlodipine for 10 days** now and haven’t noticed any effect — positive or negative. No headache, no drop in bloodpressure.  
As far as I know, **10 mg is the maximum dose**, so I probably shouldn’t increase it. Still, I expected it to **lower my blood pressure**, but it hasn’t. Maybe my body is compensating somehow?

I’m considering **trying Nifedipine next**, hoping it might work better. I’ll also ask my GP to check whether my **low red blood cell count** could contribute to poor circulation.



One more thing: do any of you experience that even when you’re **sweating during exercise**, your hands and feet still stay cold?

Another example: I can drink liters of hot tea or coffee and sit in a T-shirt and shorts, feeling my core burning with warmth — yet **nothing seems to reach my hands or feet**.

So the typical advise of family and friends are useless, because my body doesn't work this way.

I’m a bit jealous of my fiancée — after just five minutes of walking, her hands are already warm, while mine stay freezing. Like many of you, it really limits me in everyday life.

Hand and foot warmers are a possible solution, but they’re not always practical to use throughout the day.

What I’m most curious about, though, is whether **you also keep cold hands and feet during exercise**. Especially now that temperatures are dropping below 10°C, it’s becoming a serious limitation for me when I try to do sport outside.

Coffee, adrenaline, and guilt became my daily companions. I knew I was capable of more, but somehow, I always convinced myself that tomorrow, somehow, I’d do better.

Days turned into weeks. Weeks turned into months. And every time I looked at my to-do list, it stared back at me like a scoreboard of failures. I felt lazy. I felt weak. But the worst part? I was mad at myself, yet kept repeating the same cycle.

Then one day, I stopped pretending I needed “motivation” or some magical burst of energy. I realized the problem wasn’t me being lazy—it was me thinking I could rely on *feeling ready*. I wasn’t ready. Nobody ever is. And waiting for that perfect moment was wasting my life.

So I did something ridiculously small. I wrote down **three tiny tasks** I could actually finish today. No grand plans, no miracle productivity hacks. Just three things. And I did them. One by one. Not perfectly. Not quickly. Just done.

That small action broke the cycle. It taught me a simple truth: **action beats intention every single time**.

Here’s what’s actually helping me now:

* **Set 3 daily non-negotiables**: Tiny, doable tasks. Hit them no matter what. For me: 1) reply to emails, 2) write 200 words, 3) review my schedule.
* **Use a timer**: Work in 25-minute sprints. Stop scrolling, stop overthinking. Just work. 25 minutes. Rest. Repeat.
* **Track progress**: Check off every task, even the small ones. Seeing things done feels *insanely satisfying*.
* **Cut distractions**: Phone in another room. Music off if it tempts you. Make your environment work for you, not against you.
* **Be okay with 50% effort**: Some days you’ll crush it, some days you won’t. Do something. Anything. 50% is still progress.

No one clapped for me. No dopamine rush. No congratulatory message. Just me, finishing things on time for the first time in forever. And for once, that was enough.

“Good morning, Cradle! Tuesday, August 12th, 2008. Gonna be a scorcher today—high of ninety-one, low of sixty-eight. Perfect fishing weather, if you ask me. Now let’s get into the morning tunes—”

The guitar riff had barely started when Walt slapped the alarm off. He sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the wall where the wallpaper peeled like old sunburn. His room hadn’t changed much in the forty years of his life. Same rickety dresser, same naked window, same water stain on the ceiling that looked like a bird about to take flight but never quite making it. This was his childhood mausoleum, preserved in smoke and mildew. 

His mother’s door, down the hall, stayed shut now. Always would. Walt never could bring himself to go in there after she died. He’d walk past it sometimes, holding his breath, as if even the air around it carried her ghost. Maybe it was fear that kept him away—fear that if he turned that old brass knob, he’d find her waiting inside, sitting on the edge of the bed in her nightgown, face pale as moonlight and eyes full of all the things she never said.

Or maybe it wasn’t fear at all. Maybe it was sorrow—the kind that settles deep in the bones, heavy as wet sand. Because the truth was, Walt didn’t need to open that door to know she was still in there. The house already remembered her for him.

In the kitchen, Walt ate Spaghetti O’s straight from the can. Cold. Most folks would gag, but Walt liked it that way. The slippery noodles slid down his throat soft as a good memory. He’d eaten them like that as a boy, crouched on the living room floor while his mother sat with her cigarette and gin, and some things just stuck.

By six-thirty he was in his green jumpsuit, WALT stitched above the pocket, laces double-knotted on his steel-toed boots. He grabbed his keys and headed out to his faithful Ford Ranger. The truck coughed awake like an old smoker, paint faded from firehouse red to sun-bleached pink. The driver’s side mirror was taped on, and the radio gave nothing but static, but Walt coaxed it into gear with the tenderness of a man leading a sick horse. He patted the dashboard and called it a “good girl”.

The waste management lot sat on the far edge of town, where the streetlights thinned out and the asphalt gave way to weeds. The fence leaned like an old drunk at last call, barbed wire sagging, rust eating through the chain-links. Beyond it, the rows of garbage trucks crouched in the dark, hulking shapes with their hoods yawning open like beasts asleep mid-snarl. The air smelled like oil and rot and burnt coffee—the strange perfume of the place, baked into Walt’s clothes so deeply his own house sometimes carried it.

He eased his Ranger into his usual spot, tires crunching on gravel that had long ago swallowed the lines of the parking spaces. For a moment, he sat with the engine ticking itself cool, watching the lot the way a man might watch a graveyard. Then he reached out, patted the cracked dashboard like he always did, and got out.

Number 12 waited for him in her slot, paint the color of mildew and old pennies, streaked with years of rain and diesel exhaust. Walt knew every quirk she had—the soft groan of her brakes when he eased up to a stop sign, the stubborn driver-side mirror that liked to rattle loose, the patch on her left fender where rust had eaten through and the mechanics slapped on a square of mismatched metal. Most of the other drivers swapped trucks whenever one went down for repairs, but not Walt. Number 12 was his. She always started for him. Always.

He ran his hand along the door as he climbed in, like greeting a faithful dog. The seat springs jabbed him in the thigh, the vinyl torn open years ago, but he hardly noticed. He turned the key, and the engine gave a throaty cough, then settled into its familiar growl. That sound always settled him too—like the beat of a heart he could trust when his own felt too lonely.

Walt’s route carried him through the town’s veins. Cradle wasn’t big—you could drive end-to-end in twenty minutes if you ignored the speed limit—but Walt knew every corner like his own hands.

Mrs. Langston’s house first. She always set out two empty wine bottles, even though she swore she didn’t drink. Walt never judged. Trash told the truth, and he was the man who listened. Down on Willow Street, the Thompsons had diapers heavy as sandbags. New baby. He wondered if it was a boy or girl. He thought about babies more than he liked—how small they were, how easy it would be to break one. That thought scared him sometimes. Other times it lingered.

Trash was like fishing. You never knew what you’d pull up. Secrets, shame, little victories. He could map half the town’s sins with a week’s worth of garbage. Sometimes, lifting a lid, he’d picture spilling everything across the lawn. What would they do, he wondered, if all their secrets were out in the sunlight? He imagined the shouting, the shame, sometimes even imagined swinging the lid into someone’s head if they got too angry with him, the sound it would make—like knocking a melon off the counter. The thought came easy, slid right in, but he never acted. Not yet, anyway. No one had given him a reason.

Still, it wasn’t all dark. Walt liked the barefoot boy on Willow Street, freckles and a grin that could light up the block. Every Tuesday morning: “Hi, Mister Walt!” at the top of his lungs. And Walt, who wasn’t good with words, always managed to lift his hand in return. That wave carried him for a whole day.

Mrs. Pennington, widow in the blue ranch style house, left coupons for fishing gear under her trash lid. Sometimes notes in swirly handwriting: Thank you, Walt. He kept every letter in a shoebox under his bed, smoothing them flat at night until the ink blurred beneath his fingers.

But then there were the others. The McCormick boys thought it was funny to leave him fish guts in the summer heat. Walt slammed their lids harder than he needed to. Let them hear it. And old man Kersey—Jesus. He just stood at his window, arms folded, watching Walt like a butcher watches hogs at auction. Walt sometimes gripped the can too tight, imagined hurling it through that smug pane of glass. Never did. But the thought stuck, hot as a coal.

The waves, though—the thanks, the kindness—they filled something empty inside him. He held onto them, because he knew: kindness had an expiration date. Everything did. One of the few things his mother taught him well.

By noon, the truck was full and the sun was baking the road. Walt parked her back in her spot, gave Number 12 a pat like always, and stepped down.

Rick Harlan waited by the gate, cigarette dangling from his lip. Scrawny man, but mean as vinegar.

“You’re late again, Keen.”

Walt blinked at him. “No I’m not.”

Rick snorted. “Always are. Work too slow. But…” He tapped ash on the ground. “…you do it right. Best man I got, even if you move slower than Christmas.”

Walt nodded. Didn’t matter if it was insult or praise. Rick barked, but he didn’t bite. Walt could live with barking. He could make him shut up if the barking got too loud.

“Go on,” Rick said. “Before the sun cooks us both.”

Walt finished up his shift the way he always did, slow and steady, like a man checking boxes on a list only he knew. He unloaded the truck, the stink clinging to him no matter how hard he hosed the bins out. Then he gave Number 12 a good wash, the suds streaking down her sides in dirty gray rivulets. After that he swept the lot—cracked blacktop littered with gravel and cigarette butts—then the office, too, raising little clouds of dust that caught in the strip-light overhead.

All the while he hummed. Just a little tune, nothing fancy. Couldn’t for the life of him say where he’d picked it up. Radio, maybe. Or some old movie he’d watched as a kid. It was one of those melodies that felt older than it had any right to, like it had been following him around for years, waiting.

By the time he hung up the broom, he felt good. Better than good, actually. He was near giddy, the way a boy gets with Christmas only a night away. Because the best part of the day was still ahead of him. Well—second best. The best part, that one came later.

The little bell over Dillard’s Bait & Tackle jingled as Walt stepped inside, the smell of earthworms, soil, and old wood greeting him like an old friend. The lights were dim in here, and it was cooler than the August heat outside. The aisles were narrow, lined with rods, reels, and shelves of lures that twinkled in the dusty light.

“Afternoon, Walt!” came a cheerful voice from behind the counter.

“Good afternoon, Mr. Dillard,” Walt replied, a rare, bright smile spreading across his face. Unlike most people, he spoke easily with Mr. Dillard. Words didn’t get twisted on his tongue. His voice didn’t stick in his chest.

Mr. Dillard leaned on the counter, his Red Man cap tilted back on his balding head. “Got some new spinners in yesterday. Flashy kind. Reckon they’d catch the sun real good out on old Ashburn Lake.”

Walt’s eyes lit up. He floated toward the display, fingers hovering just above the shiny lures. “They look like jewels,” he said, soft and reverent. “Like fish candy.”

The old man chuckled. “Guess that’s one way to put it.”

Walt didn’t buy a new lure. He was here for his usual: a Styrofoam tub of fat, wriggling worms.

“Same as always?” Mr. Dillard asked, already reaching into the cooler.

“Yes, sir,” Walt said quickly, nodding. He hugged his arms across his chest, rocking once on his heels. Just once before he caught himself and stopped. He wanted to look normal here. Especially in front of Mr. Dillard who was one of the few people that treated him like he was normal.

When the worms were set on the counter, Walt dug out a neatly folded ten-dollar bill, laying it down with great care. Mr. Dillard gave him change and leaned forward, lowering his voice.

“Saw a couple fellas come in earlier, said the bass are jumping out the water like crazy on the south side. You oughta give it a try.”

Walt beamed. “That’s my spot. Nobody bothers me there.”

“That so? Well, then, you’re ahead of the game,” the old man said with a wink.

Walt lingered a moment longer, not out of awkwardness this time, but pure comfort. Then he waved and stepped back into the bright heat of day, worms tucked safely under his arm.

Ashburn Lake waited at the far edge of town, dark and secret, the water black as tar where the trees leaned over it. Folks came in the summer—families hauling coolers, radios blaring tinny country music, kids cannonballing off the roped pier on the north side. That was their side. Walt never went near it.

He preferred the other way, the way less trampled. On the south side of the lake, through reeds that whispered against his jeans, his boots squelching in the soft mud. Out there the bugs were thicker, the air hung heavier, and the water smelled old, like something bottled up and left too long in the dark. Walt didn’t mind. He had a spot. A log polished smooth by years of sitting, just wide enough for one man and a tackle box. His place.

He baited his hook with the same care a priest might fold a vestment, then cast his line into the still water. The ripples spread, shivered, and died. The bobber floated like a blood-red eye on the surface.

Hours slid by in that strange, syrupy way they do when a man’s alone with nothing but his thoughts. The sun sank lower, painting the treeline in copper and gold before the shadows swallowed it whole. Cicadas buzzed so loud it felt like the world itself was humming.

Walt sat, motionless, like part of the log. He never minded if the fish didn’t bite. The lake gave him something else, something he couldn’t quite name. A silence so deep it seemed to settle in his bones, though sometimes—on nights like this—he thought it wasn’t silence at all, but listening.

And then he saw her.

A girl. Barefoot. Sixteen, maybe seventeen. Hair black as oil, dress pale in the fading light. She stood at the edge, staring into the water like it was whispering to her.

Walt froze. He knew everyone in Cradle. Every last face, every last name, going back to before he could shave. But not her. She was new. And there weren’t supposed to be new people in Cradle.

If a family had moved in, he would’ve heard. Hell, the whole town would’ve been buzzing. A new car in a driveway, a stranger buying milk at Danner’s, even the smell of different laundry soap on the wind—folks here noticed. They noticed and they talked. That was the way of it.

But she didn’t fit. Not into the stories, not into the gossip, not into the town itself. In Walt’s whole life, only three families had ever tried to settle here. Only one had lasted, and they were still here, clinging on like a stubborn weed.

And now this one. This girl. Standing there like she’d always been part of the picture.

He wanted to speak, but the words jammed up in his throat. They always did when his nerves got the better of him—like someone had stuffed cotton down there, heavy and choking. So he kept quiet. Just sat on his log, watching her through the reeds, pretending to fuss with his line.

The sun slid down further, bleeding out behind the trees until the lake turned into a sheet of black glass. The cicadas quieted. Even the frogs seemed to think better of it. Walt stayed longer than he meant to, packing and unpacking the same hook, waiting for her to move. She never did.

Walking back through the reeds, Walt felt the hair on his neck prickle upright. That old animal sense—eyes on him, though the only sound was his own boots sucking at the mud. He risked a glance over his shoulder.

The girl hadn’t moved. Not an inch. She stood at the water’s edge, pale face tilted down, her gaze locked on the black surface. Not watching him at all. Watching the lake. Like she was waiting for something to break through—something patient, something that knew how to bide its time.

Walt forced himself on, each step quicker than the last, reeds whispering against his legs. By the time he slid behind the wheel, his heart was knocking like a fist on a locked door.

He drove home with her image burned into him, seared there like a brand—the way she stood so still, the way she stared at the water. And the thought kept gnawing at him all the way back through town: she hadn’t looked like she was waiting for a fish. She looked like she was waiting for something to rise that had no business rising at all.

In that moment, something took root in Walt. An itch he couldn’t scratch, a thought that wouldn’t leave him alone. He had to know who she was. Where she’d come from. Folks didn’t just show up in Cradle, not on his side of the lake, not without the whole town knowing.

But she had. She’d found it—his side of the water, the place no one else went. Maybe, just maybe, that meant something. Maybe she was cut from the same cloth. Maybe she was just like him.

And that thought lodged itself deep, the way a fishhook lodges past the barb. Once it’s in, there’s no getting it out without blood.",1,1761908476.0,Grim_stories,0,1.0,False

1okrgzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKtiktokbehavingbadly/comments/1okrgzo/so_then_stomper/,So then Stomper,"
This is going to be long winded folks.  Grab a coffee and strap in.

We all know that you read what's on reddit.  After all your Instagram posts show that, so let's point out a few things with your story about the cat that isn't true.

Having permission for a cat:

You have claimed this when the first mention of a cat.  You then repeated this claim yesterday.....but then your lies slipped and you said that you didn't have permission, even trying to claim you didn't need permission.

You then claimed that you won't let housing in and the RSPCA would need a warrant.

Housing have every right to enter the property, and this will be in the agreement you made.  The same agreement that says that pets are not allowed.

The RSPCA don't need a warrant, and if they have permission from housing will enter that room.

Lack of understanding about cats:

Stomper you have literally no idea how to look after yourself never mind a cat.  You seem to think that a cat just needs food and water.  If only that was true.

Cats are sensitive creature and if not sometimes demanding.  They need attention, warmth and good nutrition.  What they don't need is someone that screeches Defying Gravity like a Beegee with their dick caught in their zip.

They hate noise and that is all you produce.  They like clean environments, and we all know that you can't keep yourself clean.  As for the shit tip of a room.....I would say that's unsafe for a cat.

The cost of keeping a cat:

Again Stomper you don't have a clue in the cost of keeping a cat.  It's not as simple as food, water and cat litter, which I doubt you will be buying as you don't even shop properly for yourself.

Again, cats are sensitive to what they eat.  You can't just put food down and they will eat it.  Christ I have 4 and all they will eat is Whiskas.  Try anything else and they will just look at you as if you had come from another planet.  But it's not just Whiskas they have but also treats and fresh food.

Then you have worming....when was the cat last wormed?  You can't not worm them and hope for the best.  You don't even know how many times a year you are meant to do it.

Then of course the flea treatment.  Again flea treatment can't be done just because they have fleas.  You have to take a proactive approach so that they don't catch fleas in the first place.

A clean place that is hoovered properly daily, as well as a routine of flea repellent items is required.  Again that's not just as simple as oh here's some spot on.

Then you have vet costs and injections.

Cats are now required by law to be microchipped, and I very much doubt that you will be doing that 

Now let's take a look at insurance and again that isn't cheap.  In fact insurance companies won't even take on cats or dogs now unless they are microchipped.

All mine are microchipped even though at the time it wasn't required by law.  Oh and Stomper a Microchip isn't something you can get out of the freezer and cook for 2 minutes.

I could say a load more, but I would be writing all day.

You can't look after yourself, and it was only last week how you was begging claiming that you needed it for electric and shopping.  You also claimed that you needed to go to a food bank.

You have lied about numerous things in relation to the cat, and you haven't even told the original owner of your real name.

Your history is that you are an abusive and narcissistic individual, who is a danger to people including you.

You have a history of animal abuse, and that isn't me saying that or listening to what other people say......that history of animal abuse has come out of your own mouth.

You are constantly moving, which is definitely something no animal likes.  You have nothing to keep the cat entertained, you don't have any scratching posts, anything for the cat to climb.  You literally have nothing.

You have a long long standing history of fraud and deception.  You think the world revolves around you.  It doesn't.

Now you have either got this cat to scam people out of money by claiming that whatever money is given will go towards the cat, or you get a raging hard on by pissing people off.

So given that people gave you money for WiFi and food last week and it seems to have gone on something else, will you be giving those people the money back?  Of course you won't because you only think of yourself.

That is my point......how can you even look after a cat when your focus is on you and you alone.  You don't give a toss about anyone or anything as long as Stomper gets what they want and not what you need.  I know what you need but I won't say it as I will get a ban.

The fact that you can't even understand why people are quite rightly concerned and angry beggars belief.  You constantly lie and then wonder why people don't believe you.

I for one hope housing boot you out and that cat goes somewhere safe away from you.",20,1761908394.0,UKtiktokbehavingbadly,4,0.96,False

1okrfts,https://i.redd.it/whwv5ahxhfyf1.jpeg,Opinion on Valoura discovery set for her 😾✌🏼,"I wanted to share my honest thoughts on the Valoura Discovery Set (For Her). The presentation immediately caught my eye as it comes in a beautiful wooden box that feels elegant and sturdy when opened. Inside, the vials sit perfectly in a soft foam base, and there’s a printed card that lists every note in detail for each fragrance, which makes exploring them a lot more fun.

One thing that did make me laugh though was the amount of paper shredder inside the box. I opened it with the fan on and it went flying everywhere 😭 but I get why it’s there as the vials are glass and need that extra protection.

A detail that genuinely impressed me was the inclusion of six testing strips. I’ve tried a few discovery sets before like Titan and some international ones, but none of them ever added testing strips. It actually made such a difference because I could test each scent one by one without mixing. I even wrote their names on the strips while trying them, which made the whole experience feel more personal and organized.

The For Her set includes:

• Miss Sin – playful, confident, and bold • La Belle – sweet and feminine with soft vanilla and juicy pear, maybe even a touch of berry • Apple of Heaven – bright, crisp apple with a fresh sparkle • Libere – clean, floral, and strong • Rouge 40 – a sweet amber scent, warm and rich • Vanilla 28 – creamy vanilla with a cozy feel

Out of all of them, La Belle and Miss Sin stood out the most for me. La Belle feels so wearable and comforting; that mix of vanilla and fruity notes gives it a soft, elegant vibe. The projection was decent and it lasted well through the day. Miss Sin, on the other hand, has this bold, flirty energy that makes it perfect for evenings.

Rouge 40 wasn’t really my type, but I’ll admit it’s a beautiful blend. It’s sweet and ambery, smooth from start to finish, just a little stronger than what I usually prefer.

Performance wise, Miss Sin and Libere lasted around 7+ hours indoors and much longer on clothes. I could still smell Miss Sin on my clothes the next day, which honestly surprised me. Each fragrance opens cleanly and transitions beautifully without any harsh or chemical edges.

The bottles are simple, and the sprayer feels firm and consistent. The overall presentation gives off a thoughtful and well finished feel.

I also have the For Him Discovery Set, and I’ll probably share my thoughts on that separately once I’ve gone through them properly. For now, I can say the For Her collection left a really good impression, elegant presentation, well blended scents, and a lot of care put into the little details.",3,1761908289.0,PerfumeIndia,0,1.0,False
1okrfmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1okrfmo/when_friendship_finds_you_unexpectedly/,When Friendship Finds You Unexpectedly,"It all started with a random friend request on Facebook. She was a married woman kind, cool and not someone who opened up easily. Still, we began chatting casually. At first, she was like most people online polite but distant. Yet, there was something genuine in the way she spoke.

As days passed, she started knowing me better. I’d tease her lightly, pull her leg a bit, and that’s how she slowly began trusting me. I’ve always believed when you don’t seek anything, just be kind and real that’s when strangers start to feel safe with you. 

Our conversations went on for about a week, and one fine day, she invited me for coffee. Honestly, I’m the kind of guy who’s talkative over text but a bit shy in person a little awkward until I get comfortable. Still, I agreed.

Meeting her for the first time was something different. She was elder to me, but I’ve always felt I can vibe better with people older than me they bring calmness and understanding. We sat, talked for about an hour, and even though it was our first meeting, it didn’t feel forced.

Funny part is that we didn’t even shake hands in the beginning. But while leaving, she smiled and said from now handshake is a must. 

And that’s where the real story begins.
One thing I realized women crave genuine friendship. Once they feel safe and respected, they open up in ways you wouldn’t expect. She did too even shared a few of her deepest, darker secrets.

The air pollution that could probably kill a horse, the corruption that’s just casually part of morning coffee, the traffic that turns 2km into a full-blown Netflix episode, the “human decency” that’s on permanent vacation, the broke-as-hell economy, and people who press both elevator buttons because physics apparently doesn’t apply to them.

I grew up with all that chaos, but I was young — stupidly optimistic, maybe — so I didn’t take it that seriously.  
Now? Bro… I’ve spent the last 3.5 years basically solo-mode — no close friends, barely any social life, just studying, working abroad, grinding. Then I came back to UB to help out with my family business because things got big, responsibilities got real, and family’s family, right?

But holy shit. This city? These people?  
It’s like life on “Hard Mode” with no respawns.

Every day I wake up like, “Why the fuck am I still here?”  
The job market is a joke, salaries are tragic, and basic human kindness feels like an endangered species. Half the people I used to know are gone, or worse — still here but completely brain-dead to the reality we live in. They hang out, gossip, fake-laugh, post Insta stories pretending their lives are fine, but nobody gives a single genuine fuck about anyone.

Like, how the hell are you supposed to make actual friends or find someone real in this environment? In your 20s or 30s, it feels statistically easier to find clean air in winter UB than a decent human being.

And yeah, I know there are good folks somewhere — decent people just trying to mind their business, maybe some amazing women who already married lucky dudes and escaped this simulation early. But for the rest of us stuck here? What’s the game plan?

Do we all just apply for work visas and yeet the fuck out together?

It's a world of privilege, demure technical expertise, and primarily, inside information. For the majority, ""The Banking Club"" is no diabolical cabal; it's a lifeline. This new generation is no starchily formal boys' club; it's a high-octane, web-enabled clique dedicated to opening up careers in high-flying finance to a new generation.



They are history now days when Ivy League background and family ties were the sole gateway to the club. Now, platforms like the Instagram platform ""thebankingclub"" are valuable repositories of information, wisdom, and connection. Welcome to the new Banking Club: open, performance-driven, and dedicated to making you a success.



# More Than a Feed: A Career Launchpad in Disguise

First impression: the Instagram feed is a collection of reflective posts. But look closer, and you're offered a step-by-step tutorial on the career summit. This club doesn't take the route of using just one approach in getting that top-of-the-line finance job.



# 1. Decoding the Technical Interview.

The most feared one is the infamous tech interview. [***The Banking Club***](https://anyflip.com/sejyo/uyhz) takes it head-on. Instead of presenting list questions, it breaks down problematic theory into digestible blog posts. You could be shown a carousel explaining the nitty-gritty of Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, a video dissecting leveraged buyout (LBO) models, or an infographic dissecting enterprise value vs. equity value. Whatever content this is, it takes textbook boredom and presents it as actionable, interview-grade knowledge.



# 2. The Unwritten Rules: Networking and Etiquette.

Finance is a people business. The new Banking Club demonstrates the crucial soft skills habitually shortchanged. It covers cold email scripts, how-to interview guides, and etiquette tips on professionalism. How to approach asking a managing director on a date or even what to talk about over a coffee catch-up can make all the difference between your CV being read or remaining in the ether.



# 3. Making a Standout Resume.

With off-the-rack suits and neatly printed resumes, how do you stand out? This workshop takes you through one step at a time to craft a resume with a finance theme, practice for behavioral questions using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result), and craft a personal narrative that will impress recruiters. It reminds you that your own experience and story are your assets.



# The Power of Community: You Are Not Alone

There's one of the very best things about this new Banking Club - the community. The path to great finance is a difficult one and isolating at times.



Shared Journey: To subscribe as a page and participate in its discussions is to be part of thousands of fellow human beings equally trapped. Shared hardship breeds an insistent sense of shared effort, a fraternity that makes loneliness inspiring.



Democratization of Information: The club breaks down information barriers. Off-target students access exactly the same top-notch counseling as the high-visibility university student. It brings the process level to everyone and gives talent a leg up regardless of background.



Inspiration and Reality: Success stories and day-in-the-life blog entries on the site each week. Inspiring, of course, but also an accurate portrayal of the work, contrasting in striking fashion with the graft, commitment, and reward.



From Follower to Candidate: How to Make The Most Out of The Banking Club

Liking posts isn't sufficient. To actually make the most out of it, you should be actively and intentionally engaging.



Use it as a Curriculum. Scroll but scroll, don't just. Read the technical posts slowly. Note down techniques of valuation and complete interview questions they cover.

# The Verdict: An Evolution Required

Yesterday's ""[***The Banking Club***](https://www.reddit.com/user/Radiant_Street_4709/comments/1od2aqh/the_new_gatekeepers_how_the_banking_club_uses_ai/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) "" was shut, selective, and even occasionally out-of-bounds to outsiders. Its futuristic generation digital-native counterpart is its opposite. It is open, expansive, and liberating. It recognizes that banking's future is in attracting and nurturing the brightest minds wherever they may be.



Even with the information being worth its weight in gold, don't forget that there is no Instagram club page that can do everything for you. The club provides you with the map, tools, and tribe, but you have to walk it yourself. You are the one who has to soak up the information, work on the skills, and put yourself out there.



And lastly, this new Banking Club is not a Twitter hashtag. It's a badge of an evolving profession. It's an open forum where resolve is cemented, experience is developed, and the door to a high-flying career in finance is being thrown wide open from the inside out. For any young graduate or student looking to cut their teeth, becoming part of your ranks as a member of this club might be the best money you ever spent.

1okr6el,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1okr6el/im_not_sure_how_to_explain_what_happened_last/,I’m not sure how to explain what happened last night,"This might sound made up as it’s odd it happened literally during Halloween night, but here we go. My boyfriend and I live together in a lower ground floor flat, the house the flat part of is one of the classic British Victorian terraced houses. I admit that I am a person who is highly suggestible, I do believe in ghosts and the paranormal, but my partner absolutely doesn’t at all and overtime I started getting used to telling myself stuff was just in my head and each and every weird noise or feeling was just something that could be logically explained. We never really experienced anything weird in the house, just the usual creaks and noises of old buildings. 

Last night we both stayed up late, my boyfriend was playing video games and I was reading a book, so we went to bed around 1:30am as we were both working from home the next day. I have been taking for the past two weeks the SleepEazy pill to sleep better, it does make me have weird dreams sometimes, but as I often have hard time falling asleep I thought they might help restore a healthy sleeping pattern. Not long after I fell asleep I got a weird feeling as if someone was hovering over me and I thought my boyfriend maybe woke up to go pee or get water. I opened my eyes and there was a human-shaped figure completely dark like a shadow and quite tall at the end of my bed. For a split second I thought it was my boyfriend, but it was as if I couldn't put the thing into focus with my eyes and I got a weird spooky feeling, so I closed my eyes and then re-opened them and saw different smaller shadows almost dissipating around. Again, as I thought the SleepEazy pill was making me lucid dream, I then told myself I was just seeing things, rolled over and fell back asleep. After a while, I woke up and had again the same feeling of someone being in the room, but this time I didn’t even open my eyes and went back to sleep, both because I was scared and because I didn't want to fuel what I thought was my imagination.

I woke up this morning and thought nothing of it and didn't even think of bringing it up, as I mentioned my boyfriend is very skeptical and I genuinely convinced myself it was all in my head. We were making coffee in the kitchen this morning and he tells me had a weird night sleep, that he was feeling so tired and fell asleep straight away, but then he woke up all of a sudden because he felt there was a presence as if someone was in the room. He said he looked around the room and towards the door and nothing was there and he went back to sleep. Needless to say, my blood got cold and I got chills everywhere and told him that’s exactly what happened to me and told him about my experience. I also asked him if he can tell at what point of the night this was, and he said not longer after we initially went to bed, which is exactly what was for me.

Honestly we are both a bit spooked and freaked out, again my boyfriend is a big skeptical but even he cannot understand how did this happen to both of us. My boyfriend to make me feel better said maybe it was one of our passed relatives looking after us, but the feeling I had was very uneasy and dark, so I don’t think it was that. Has anyone experienced this? Are we going insane or is this just some sort of sleep paralysis thing? In any case, I am going to get sage today.

1okr6d0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Voicesofthevoid/comments/1okr6d0/09_assorted_update_thoughts_after_8_ingame_days/,(0.9) Assorted update thoughts after ~8 ingame days,"I never though I'd make just a straight yapping post like this but I guess there's a first time for everything.



Starting with the tutorial: I like the more guided style of the hint bubbles but it should definitely be pointed out you can't interact with certain things until the tutorial tells you to, I've seen a few posts of people thinking something bugged. The best way to tutorialize something IMO is having a single step, and then making people do that step in practice to internalize it, not dumping all the text and having players repeat everything afterward.  
Could probably have expanded slightly on the new hash code tutorial but it was fine to figure out. Otherwise no real complaints re: the tutorial.

  
New scanning system: The triangulation system is cool! In some ways it's more painful in the early game because you have to move 3 things over slowly somewhere, but in other ways it's nice because I haven't seen it error out other than the signal disappearing (still baffling there isn't a ""grace period"" of sorts for that, or at least I haven't noticed any). I wish the default yellow cursor didn't exist and it was just the RGB cursors though, because the yellow cursor is good for nothing and its position when you switch to it is based on the RGB positions. As far as I can see the only reason why you'd move it is because it's faster(?) than the others for the sake of teleporting the other cursors to your location.

  
Hash codes: mostly cool, having to write down text before was clumsy so I like the change. The change I don't like is that transferring stuff to a floppy disc is unreliable. It's 10 packets, each has a chance to fail, and if it does the process starts over again? Okay man, my favourite thing in my immersive atmospheric horror game is when I am compelled to alt tab to wait for it to finish. I hope/assume that server upgrades lower this chance but this straight up should not be a feature, it sucks, I'm sorry!



Tape recorder task: I like it more than I probably should, but I do think it's weird the cost for buying more tapes is 20 points considering the task only gives 25, at that point it's only worth if it you lost the tape and you'd otherwise be getting fined...



Transformer minigames: The color matching one makes me afraid but so far just clicking based off vibes will solve it pretty quickly. The sine wave is neat but it's a lot easier to just stare at the percentage number when turning dials rather than visually getting the sines to match up, lol. I like them overall, I think. 



Server minigames: I've only seen like 3 other than the math one (the falling bits, the maze, the fallout hacking) but they seem neat. The falling bits and the maze can end up feeling a bit too hard (the first one just by random chance on how many bits you have to flip, the maze one mostly on if you have shaky hands or not), so it was definitely good foresight to have toggles for which minigames to enable. 



Upgrade tab changes: I noticed several upgrades have been removed from the tab and I think it's mostly for the better. The ones that are definitely gone are server stability (though that's probably because you install physical upgrades now), transformer stability, ping size and sensor size (good riddance, who cares about them), sensor success rate, and Filter size (my favourite removal, because even at level 0 it has to be possible to get the polarity and frequency to be good enough, so fundamentally it's a poor idea for an upgrade). I like all of this, I think there are a couple of upgrades that could also stand getting the boot: Breaker components time 100% has to go, it's pretty much irrelevant how quickly you can turn things off from the PC. One between Detector Frequency and Detector Sensitivity must be excised, there's really no point in having 2 upgrades for the same thing. The radar upgrades can probably also go or maybe be turned into physical upgrades but I'm not that pressed about them.



Physical modules: Very cool, but painful initial cost of having to get an impact driver and painful installation ""cost"" of having to turn off stuff before being able to install it. Imo you should be able to install it by turning the specific panel off, but right now it seems like you can only install it if you turn everything (or maybe utilities, haven't tried) off.



New ATV: I dunno, I am starting to feel like driving this thing is a money loss compared to just sprinting over there, it's not \*that\* much faster considering you need to be careful with driving in certain parts or you die. It's fine I guess, my only true negative thought is that it's easy to forget the lights on and that will drain ALL your battery overnight, and that's painful. I can't comment on the physical ATV upgrades because I'm still relatively broke but they look cool.



Drone changes: I think it's great how the drone sticks around and you can just put whatever inside it and then send it off, not much else to say but it's funny how since the drone beep wakes you up it means Kel will realistically NEVER get a good nights' sleep ever again. 



New base: I mean what can I say, really? It's gorgeous. I'm glad we have a coffee machine now. I'm confused but glad we have an ATM now. I can't say a new base design is what I'd have prioritized in development but it's still a nice upgrade.

  
New UI icons (food/stam/whatever): Cool upgrade but I feel like they're upscaled wrong, at least on my screen...



New events: haven't seen anything yet because it's still day 8 ofc, but the vent knocker event now opening the vent in the signal room instead of it being open to begin with is a very good sign.



Farming: Still busted.

  
Kerfur: Still stupid.

I think I know the answer to this already but need some outside/unbiased opinions please!

  
I'm a 34f living in the UK with my 38m partner of nearly 7 years (not married). We own our home and have a 4 year old child together. We both work full time, he makes a fair amount more than me and we probably split all the bills are 70/30 with him paying more than me. We handle our finances by putting our wages in a joint bank account each month from which all our bills come out (including personal ones like phone bills, dentist visits etc). We both keep £500 from our wages in our own personal accounts so we have some money for ourselves each month. For example, this is what I may for my haircuts, clothes or coffees while I'm out etc. 

  
To get to the issue... after we'd been together for about a year (we had already bought our house together) I found out he'd taken out a £12,000 loan behind my back. I only found out as the loan provider kept calling our home phone number looking for him as he'd been missing payments. Turns out he'd taken the loan out to pay off some money he owed his parents (I had no idea he owed this money to them either). I helped him pay this money off as he couldn't keep up with the monthly repayments and things were a bit uncertain due to the covid lockdowns etc. My parents also helped substantially with this. We had a huge fight, it wasn't really the debt that bothered me, it was the lying. He promised that he's never lie about anything, particularly money, again. 

Fast forward a couple of years, we were having to go through our finances to apply for a new fixed rate mortgage so required lots of bank statements. I handle all the bills/paperwork stuff as he hates it. As I was going through everything, I could see his was spending around £500 per month on gambling websites. I knew he sometimes gambled but had no idea we were talking about that much money. We agreed the money we kept back each month was for what ever we wanted but he was consistently in his overdraft so spending money he doesn't actually have. Again, another big (ish) fight. He says he didn't lie as we never really had a conversation about it so we agreed more transparency and moved on. 

  
January 2025 we had to go through the mortgage stuff again and exactly the same situation. Over £1000 in his overdraft and spending hundreds each month on gambling. This time hurt even more as I would occasionally ask him how much he has in his account (never asked to check) and he'd tell me £100 or £200 etc. Turns out what he was telling me was the amount he had ""available"" in his account which would include his arranged overdraft. This led to a huge fight as I hate being lied to! We had a tight few months to pay of his overdraft as he gets daily charges for when he's in it. He also agreed that he'd show me his online account if I ever asked. 

  
Now we get to yesterday, this will sound unrelated by stay with me... He mentioned about upgrading his phone contract as he keeps running out of data. This was a big red flag to me as he'd do a lot of the gambling while at work and on mobile data. I asked him to show me his usage, second on the list was a casino website... he started saying it was to do daily free bets but I'm familiar with these sites so asked him to show me transaction history. I didn't get to look for long as our daughter was with us but there's at least £400 been paid in over the last 2 months. I asked to see his online banking but he had to go to work and when he came home he had a migraine and went straight to bed. I think this was genuine as he really did look like he was in pain. 

  
I asked him this morning if there was anything else I wouldn't be comfortable with when I look at his banking when he gets home from work tonight. He said there was just gambling payments but he was also over £1000 back in his overdraft. I was in total shock, furious and just started crying. I couldn't really say much as our daughter was with us but he told me yesterday he was only £50 in his overdraft so has again just lied to me. 

  
I don't know what to do in terms of our relationship. He does support us but I don't know if this is something I can move past anymore. He keeps lying about the same thing and has previously done some other things which has affected how much I trust him. As far as I know, he's never cheated on me but I'm questioning how I can know that for sure when he finds it so easy to lie to my face about about things.

  
AIO if I'm thinking about ending our relationship over this?

Hi! Reposting this since I've yet to find someone 🥴

Dating apps haven't been a great experience lately, so I figured I could shoot my shot here (again).

I'm a 25 year old musician who loves video games just as much as all things music. So much so, I've got a day job as a Play Tester. 

Someone told me to date a best friend, so here I am looking for someone to make great friends with. I'm looking for someone I can share my days with, someone I can spend my free time with. Me-time is great and all, but to commit my time for someone else gives that sense of fulfillment I'm looking for in life. To be vulnerable with someone is a feeling worth searching for.

Sitting for 8-10 hours a day restricts blood circulation in the lower body. Over time, this leads to swollen veins around the anal area — one of the leading causes of piles.

**2. Constipation from Office Habits**

Skipping water, ignoring nature’s call, and surviving on coffee or junk food are common IT work patterns. These habits slow down bowel movement, causing hard stools and straining — both key triggers for fissures.

**3. Stress and Irregular Meals**

Constant project pressure and irregular mealtimes cause digestive imbalances. Spicy or processed foods consumed in a hurry can worsen symptoms and inflame the digestive tract.

#  The Role of Modern Proctology in Treating These Issues

When symptoms like bleeding or pain persist, it’s not something to ignore. This is where **Dr. Atul & Dr. Sarita Patil – Vithai Piles Hospital** come into the picture.

#  Myth-Busting: Piles Are Not Just for the Elderly

Many young professionals in their 20s and 30s believe piles or fissures affect only older adults. That’s a myth.  
In fact, most new-age patients diagnosed at[ Vithai Piles Hospital](https://share.google/MbkeERqcNP14NrNxp) belong to the IT and corporate sector. Their hectic schedules and inactive lifestyles make them highly vulnerable.

#  When to See a Doctor

Visit a *Proctologist near you* immediately if you notice:

* Persistent pain or itching near the anal area
* Bleeding during bowel movements
* Swelling or lump near the anus
* Difficulty sitting for long hours

These symptoms might seem small but can worsen quickly without proper medical care.
