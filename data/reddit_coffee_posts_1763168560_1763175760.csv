I’m getting ready to open a small coffee-only trailer in Long Beach, and I’m struggling to find a local commissary that’s actually approved for mobile food servicing (especially gray-water disposal).

For anyone permitted in Long Beach:

•	Which commissary are you using?

•	Are you really commuting to LA/OC every day for servicing/parking?

•	What are you paying monthly? (I’m seeing $1,400–$1,500+ for just a coffee setup — feels crazy.)

•	Any tips on the Long Beach health permit process?

Any real experiences or advice would really help. Thanks!",1,1763175489.0,foodtrucks,0,1.0,False

I found a couple candidates for places to stay-- one in Stockholm, one in old town of Tallinn. I've always wanted to go to Tallinn, im massively into history, and architecture and i think it would be a cool enviornment to work on my current piece, but I'm concerned it might be a little TOO small and cramped in Tallinn in March. Does talinn get pretty boring in winter, and are there any side trips I could take once a week or whatever? i know Helsinki could be one day, not sure how easy it is to get around without a car other than that? Anything cool near Tallinn to see?





also there is no kitchen in the apartment, will I be okay eating in talinn for a month without breaking the bank? I figure, coffee and breakfast somewhere, maybe make my own lunch from grocery stores or have a cheap lunch and make sandwiches or snacks for dinner or something.

The new exemptions - which took effect retroactively at midnight on Thursday - mark a sharp reversal for Trump, who has long insisted that the sweeping import duties he imposed earlier this year are not fueling inflation.

Consumers have remained frustrated over high grocery prices, which economists say have been fueled in part by import tariffs and could rise further next year as companies start passing on the full brunt of the import duties.",3,1763174977.0,truenews,2,0.8,False

I’ve moved to a place I haven’t lived in quite a few years and well before I was on NDIS, so will be finding new supports. This post/question is specifically about finding SW for the Community Access/Social funding category. For me for this type of support initially the first most important thing is feeling like I’d be super comfortable with the person right from the go because if it’s even slightly awkward it triggers all the reasons I need support and I just wish I hadn’t gone and want to leave instantly. For this particular support there doesn’t need to be an in depth info gathering/sharing interview type process. A more natural conversation rather than a more formal interview style talk will give me all the information I need on them and I have notes already that make it easy for me to clearly share the couple of requirements I do have when it comes to how to support me in social/community stuff.

So in saying that, if a meet and greets feel like an awkward interviews I’m never going to find anyone, and it will always feel like an awkward interview to me if I just meet with someone in a ‘go for coffee’ type situation, even if it’s going for a walk by the water type thing which I tried when I lived right near the beach. I’m stuck on trying to come up with ideas for ways I could do M&G with people where there’s some kind of distraction/ice breaking activity that doesn’t have a cost if possible, doesn’t lock us in to a certain amount of time being there and also allows for some talking (so for example seeing a movie together isn’t really a M&G activity). If there’s something else to do as well as talking during a first meet it helps me both with the anxiety of meeting a new person, takes the pressure off both of us because it doesn’t have the intense interview vibe, and allows me to get a sense of if we naturally find there is an ease to our conversation and finding out about each other and if we’re a good fit in a more natural way that more official interviews don’t really have.

Another context thing while trying not to overload on information and send people way off topic is my disability is not intellectual. I really don’t need any infantilising comments calling my ability to know what I’m doing with this on my own or my way of doing it. I’ve had jobs where I was team leader/ team trainer/ department supervisor. I can handle organising people stuff/communicating the things that I need to.

We dated a little when we were teenagers have stayed in touch and now have been dating for 3 years. He is a good man. He's an incredibly hard worker and we share a maintenance business together. We do not live together and he not only takes care of his house but helps me a lot with mine. This man would literally do anything for me. It was a little overwhelming at first. Brings me coffee in the morning, makes me breakfast, if I say my nose is stuffed up he runs to get a tissue. At first it was really annoying because I've been independent my entire life but I realized it was his love language and I tried to just let him help me. I swear to god that man would drive to a different city in the middle of the night if I told him that I wanted an ice cream flavor that I could only get there. It's the big heavy emotional things that I'm struggling with him about. He keeps leaving me alone at literally the worst possible moments of my life. Three of the biggest examples -

11 years ago I was g*** r****. It was horrifically violent. I knew two of the men involved and one of them played in local bands and threatened that if I ever went to another local show that I would be seriously sorry. So I didn't. Then 3 years ago a friend's band was playing. I really wanted to go but I was terrified. My boyfriend told me that if I really wanted to go to the show that he would stay by me the entire time and nothing would happen to me. I desperately wanted to reclaim that part of my life. The week befote the show I was in a panic over going. He continued to reassure me that nothing, nothing at all would happen to me. Within 3 minutes of being at the show he said something about ""being right back"" and disappeared into the crowd. Immediately I got hit hard from behind. Landed face first on the concrete with a girl on my back punching me over and over. It was a completely separate incident. The trauma to my body brought back memories of my horrific g*** r***. My boyfriend said he didn't think anything was actually going to happen so he left me just for a second.

I was 20 when my mom died suddenly and traumatically. I wasn't doing very well afterwards and started c@tting. I managed to stop after a while and was proud of the years that I had without doing it. Recently because of some overwhelming events I felt the urges again. The urge got overwhelming one day. We had been arguing though and he was telling me he was going to leave. I am absolutely not the type of person to use the threat of self-harm against a partner but I wasn't feeling safe so I told him. It was intense at that point. He said that he wanted some time to cool off because he was angry so he left and I ended up doing it. After he said he thought that I wasn't actually going to do it that's why he left.

I fought my abusive ex-husband in court to protect my girls for 13 years. The hell he put me through when we were married and the worst hell he put me through after her literally unimaginable. He did something recently that we absolutely had to go back to court for. I am terrified of being around him. For almost a month before the hearing I couldn't even function my mental health was so bad. My boyfriend promised promised me he wouldn't leave my side. He promised me he would be there in the courtroom right behind me so that I didn't have to face this man alone. Yesterday was the hearing and we walk up to the courtroom and have to walk past my ex-husband and his lawyer. I stare straight ahead and I sit down and I expect my boyfriend to sit next to me and as he's sitting down he pops back up and goes ""Oh I got to pee!"" and starts to walk off. Now I'm an absolute panic. Do I sit there and not say anything with the good chance that even though my ex is with his lawyer he might come over and ask me how I'm doing because he knows that it would be terrifying and intimidating? Do I call my partner back drawing attention to myself? He's about 5 ft away at this point and I just scream his name. He told me later that he didn't think leaving me for a few seconds to go pee would be that big of a deal.

The thing that all of these scenarios have in common is one he promised up down sideways and backwards that he would be there for me and made me trust that he would be. Also every single time it was ""I thought"" or ""I didn't think"". We had a talk about it tonight and I just freaked out and started screaming ""Maybe you shouldn't f****** think anymore because every time you f****** think it's wrong!"" I told him just listen to what your partner tells you she needs of you and just do it. Don't rethink things and then decide on your own that something different would be the better choice. We were going to move in together at the end of January but I told him tonight absolutely not. If I couldn't rely on him for those important things then I don't feel comfortable in any way moving out of the place I've lived in for 4 years and basically jumping into the unknown with him. Now he's hurt and angry. He said he tries his hardest but I feel that if you promise someone with all of your being that you will do something and you don't do it, trying doesn't mean anything.

Bioluminescent fungi, luminescent rocks, what rocks and fungi are native to Greece, etc. I am very happy with what I wrote at least. Little by little, we're getting there.

I don't have much else to tell you about today. There was a minor outage caused by having too many things in my room at once. The room I'm in shares wiring with kitchen so with the plant lights on, my computer and heater, and then father turning on the coffee maker, the electricity went out for a second. It took us an embarrassingly long time to figure out what had happened. From now on I'll be a little more careful about how many devices I have on at once. 

Because my computer shut off on me and I had to turn it on again, it is buffering new. You know the old thing has always been rough to wake up in the mornings. So, because this is so difficult to type with it freezing between every letter, I'll end this letter here. Fun fact, I had to retype this fucking thing three goddamn times because the buffering things deleted what I wrote every time I tried to click enter. I damn near punched a whole through my monitor. Goodnight.

Yours & Mine,

I’ve been chatting with this Aussie girl from my class and I honestly can’t tell if she’s flirting or just being nice.

She calls me mate, but then she’ll also tap my arm when she laughs, and kisses me on the cheek. She sits really close when we’re studying, and ask a lot about my life back home. The other day she told me she likes my accent and joked that I should teach her how to talk like me. She also started inviting me to grab coffee after class, which I like.

I’ve noticed Aussies are way more relaxed and friendly in general, so now I’m confused as hell. I don’t want to misread things and look like an idiot.

Is this normal friendly Aussie behaviour, or does it sound like she’s into me? Any advice from locals would help a ton.",8,1763174102.0,AskAnAustralian,26,0.79,False

1oxg4sb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oxg4sb,Moccamaster KBGT Switch Replacement w Part Number and Write-Up,"Disclaimer: I am not an electrician, nor an electrical engineer. I am a guy who read some specs and found an alternate part. If you do this replacement, you take on the entirety of the risk. Electricity is scary and can burn down your house. You’ve been warned.

Moving on. I have always been frustrated with Moccamaster’s policy that you can send them your coffee maker and they’ll replace an $8 electrical switch for $85 for you. So I took mine apart, read the switch amperage and voltage ratings, bought the digikey equivalent, and installed it. As far as I can tell, it’s working good as new.

Digikey part link:

https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/bulgin/C5503ALBR3602AW/5058231?so=95795547&content=productdetail_US&mkt_tok=MDI4LVNYSy01MDcAAAGeF8Dx3LSIHU2sY8MlyoCBDR2ZEeLte0HH6sRaFoVpoTpHiC0m40sDjUB4ziXWrO3m6rRhULWO2VCcqYjCzeRdbAYI-7keH3OhCl__3VVh-A

I realize the switches aren’t quite identical. The only one that matches perfectly is a 10A 125V switch. I tried that one and it burned up immediately, so I moved on to the 16A 250V switch instead.

Quick write-up:

1. UNPLUG COFFEE MAKER!!

2. Remove reservoir cover, brew basket, carafe, and carafe base. There will be water sitting in your coil that you can’t see. Dump the empty reservoir down the drain. If you don’t, you’ll end up with a puddle on your work space. Ask me how I learned that one.

2. Remove (4) Phillips head screws from the bottom cover.

3. Remove spade terminals from switch, noting which wire goes to each terminal. My KGBT goes white, red, black from left to right. Take a photo so you can reference later.

4. Remove the existing switch. This can be tough. There are little retentive arms that hold it in place. You need to compress these and press the switch out from the back. Look at the new switch. It will make sense. Be patient and don’t force it too hard.

5. Push spade terminals onto new switch, in the same order and orientation that they came off in. “On” faces left. Reference that photo you took at step 4. I plugged in my machine and tested it out before I installed the new switch into the panel cutout, just to make sure it worked. I let mine sit in the “On” position for a few minutes and then checked to make sure the switch wasn’t overheating.

6. UNPLUG THE MACHINE!!

7. Pull the terminals off once more. Press the switch into place, being sure to mimic the original orientation of the switch. “On” faces the left. Then reattach your terminals in the same order that you tested them in. 

8. Reattach the bottom cover plate and run a test pot through the maker. 

9. I’ve run several pots but continue to babysit it during pots, and I leave my maker unplugged when not in use. Soon it will have re-earned my trust. Again, electricity is scary. Treat it with respect. 

I think that’s all. I hope this is helpful and saves a bunch of people a bunch of money!

Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long.

1oxg466,https://www.reddit.com/r/roastmystartup/comments/1oxg466/confessions_of_an_seo_guy_watching_startups_panic/,Confessions of an SEO Guy Watching Startups Panic for Rankings,"So I’ve been helping a couple startups lately and maaann… SEO for a startup is like brushing your teeth while the house is on fire.
You know you need it, but everything else is screaming louder.

And every founder hits me with the same line:
Bro, can we rank in 30 days?

…yes mate, you can also make biryani in a toaster if you pray hard enough. Doesn’t mean you should.

But honestly, watching startups do SEO is hilarious:

Day 1: We want organic traffic.

Day 7: Why Google not loving us?

Day 30: Maybe our competitor bribed Google.

Day 45: Let’s post on Reddit asking for magic SEO hacks.


The truth mm… startups don’t need 10,000 tactics  they need discipline.

Not those TikTok hacks like add 7 keywords and manifest rankings.
I mean real consistency:
Write shit people actually care about…
Fix your site so Google doesn’t feel like it’s walking barefoot on Lego…
And stop stuffing keywords like you’re packing dosa masala.

Also… nobody tells startups this, but early SEO is mostly therapy.
Half my job is:
Yes bro, traffic will come.
No bro, one backlink from your cousin’s blog will not move mountains.
Yes bro, Google sees everything. Even that 404 page you ignored.

But when it works?
Ohhh… that feeling when a tiny startup gets its first 1k organic visitors…
Feels like watching a baby take its first step…
Except the baby is wearing a tie and asking for ARR.

Anyway, if you’re a startup founder grinding your SEO at 2 AM with 17 Chrome tabs, a coffee, and self-doubt…
I see you.
Keep pushing.
Google might be slow, but it’s not blind.
Just don’t give up before the compounding kicks in.

And if you ever feel lost… just remember:
Every SEO expert started as a confused human staring at Google Search Console wondering why impressions look like ECG lines.

Stay sane, stay consistent, and mm… don’t let SEO bully you.

1oxg30p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Informal_Effect/comments/1oxg30p/hg15/,Hg15,"**The morning after I kicked Mark out was the quietest morning of my life.**

**I woke up expecting to feel... I don't know... guilty. Regretful. Anxious about the inevitable fallout. But as I lay in bed, with Silas's arm thrown heavily across my chest and his breathing a slow, deep rumble against my back, all I felt was... still.**

**The static in my own head was gone.**

**I slipped out of bed and went to the kitchen. It was Saturday. I had nowhere to be. For the first time in memory, I wasn't pre-planning apologies or rehearsing conversations for my family. I was just... me.**

**So, I decided to make biscuits.**

**I pulled out the flour, the butter, the baking soda. It was a domestic, simple act. Something I used to do for comfort, but always in a rush, always as a precursor to some stressful event.**

**Now, my hands were steady. I cut the cold butter into the flour with a slow, methodical rhythm.**

**Silas emerged about twenty minutes later, a walking monument to sleep. He was wearing the gray sweatpants and nothing else, his hair a mess. He grunted, poured a mug of coffee that was thick enough to be tar, and sat down at the small kitchen table.**

**He didn't talk. He just sat, sipping his coffee and watching me.**

**I was aware of his gaze, but it wasn't the ""witchy"" stare. It wasn't the analytical, pattern-seeking look. It was just... watching. It was soft.**

**He opened the book he'd left on the table—the Karamazov one—and started to read, one-handed.**

**We existed in the small kitchen in a perfect, shared silence. The only sounds were the snick of the butter knife, the shush of flour, and the occasional thump of his mug on the table.**

**He was the ""assbackwards"" redneck, sitting bare-chested at his table. He was the ""sophisticated"" intellectual, reading Russian literature before 8 AM. And I was just Asa, the man who was in love with him, making breakfast.**

**""You're not shaking,"" he said, not looking up from his book.**

**I stopped, my hands covered in dough. ""What?""**

**""Your hands,"" he said, finally raising his eyes to me. ""When you're anxious, you work too fast. You knead the dough like you're tryin' to kill it. Right now... you're just making biscuits. You're slow.""**

**""I'm not anxious,"" I said. It was a revelation. ""I feel... good. Clear.""**

**""Peace looks good on you,"" he said simply, and went back to his book.**

**My heart did a stupid little kick-flip. I finished the biscuits, slid them into the oven, and sat down across from him with my own coffee.**

**""What's so good about that book, anyway?"" I asked, gesturing with my mug. ""You read it once a year.""**

**He marked his page. ""It's about... everything. Faith. Doubt. Why people are monsters. Why they're saints."" He tapped the cover. ""This one character, Zosima, he says that hell is the 'suffering of being unable to love.'""**

**He looked at me over the rim of his mug. ""He says that we're all responsible for everyone. That all our sins are shared. That we're all connected.""**

**""That sounds like your static,"" I said softly. ""All that noise. All that connection.""**

**""It is,"" he said. ""But it's not all bad. He says we have to love a man even in his sin. It's the only way.""**

**""You love me even in my 'waiter voice' sin?"" I teased.**

**""I love you even when you wear that pastel polo shirt,"" he shot back, his eyes crinkling. ""That's real love, Ace. Christ-like.""**

**I laughed. The oven timer went off.**

**We ate biscuits, slathered in butter and jam, at the kitchen table. The ""paradox"" and the ""chameleon"" in their final forms. He wasn't a witch, and I wasn't invisible. We were just two men, in our kitchen, sharing a meal.**

**Hell was the inability to love.**

**I looked at Silas, who was meticulously cleaning jam off his thumb, his brow furrowed in concentration.**

**""What's heaven, then?"" I asked.**

**He looked up, surprised by the question. He looked around the kitchen, at the morning light, at the half-eaten biscuit in my hand, and then at me.**

**He gave me one of those rare, full-wattage smiles.**

**""This,"" he said. ""This is pretty damn close.""**

1oxg2q3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oxg2q3/rubber_ducky_youre_the_one/,"Rubber Ducky, You’re the one.","I work on the twelfth floor, in a building that looks like every other glass box in the central city. When you are outside, all you see is your own reflection layered over strangers. When you are inside, all you see are partitions.

My partition is beige. Beige fabric, beige desk, beige drawers with keys no one bothers to use. I have been in this cube for six months now, long enough that the chair has moulded to the shape of my hips, not long enough for anyone on the floor to remember my surname without checking my email signature.

I am an account manager. That sounds more important than it is. Most days I move numbers from one place to another and smooth over the nerves of clients who think the world will end if their campaign does not launch by Friday. My life outside of work is quiet. I have a partner at home who knows me well and likes that I am not the sort of person who goes out drinking after work. At the office, I prefer to keep to myself. Fifty people on this floor, and I could not name more than ten of them without looking at the seating chart.

On the morning the duck appeared, nothing felt unusual. I arrived at eight twenty, same as every day, swiped my card at the gate, nodded at the receptionist whose name I never caught and now cannot ask, walked past the breakout area with its too-bright furniture and the smell of burnt toast. My cube waited where I left it, third row from the window, facing a corridor that leads to the bathrooms and the fire stairs.

I put my bag under the desk and woke the computer. Only when the monitor lit, did I see the yellow shape beneath it.

A rubber duck, the classic kind. Yellow body, orange beak, black dots for eyes. It sat neatly under the rim of the screen, facing me, as if it had always lived there and I had simply been too busy to see it.

For a long moment I did nothing. It is remarkable how a tiny object can pin you like an insect. I did not touch it. I examined the desk, the trash can, the floor. Everything else was as I had left it the previous night. Headphones coiled beside the keyboard. Graph pad, pen, coffee mug ring staining the top of an old media plan. No sign anyone had been through my things.

The duck did not look new. The plastic had a dullness to it, a faint scuff along one side where the colour had paled. 

I have a nephew who is obsessed with things like this. Car rides, bath time, visits to the doctor; he narrates them through the personality of whatever small object he can carry. My sister took him on one of those Disney cruises. She sent photos from the deck, him grinning with a rubber duck in each hand. Apparently people hide them all over the ship for kids to find. Prizes that no one has to earn. Harmless.

Looking at the duck on my desk, I decided that must be what had happened. The story wrote itself. One of the ducks had ended up in my bag. I had dropped it on the floor at some point. A cleaner or a coworker found it under the cube wall and set it in the most obvious place, under my screen, so someone would claim it.

It was a harmless story, and I needed a harmless story.

I picked the duck up. The plastic gave slightly under my fingers. There is a particular weight to objects like that, a hollow lightness that pretends to be solid. I turned it over. No name written on the bottom, no company logo, just a small circle where the moulding seam ended. 

No one commented on it. People passed my cube carrying folders and takeaway coffee. No one leaned in with a joke or an explanation. The duck sat where I had left it, guarding the entrance to my inbox, and by lunchtime I had almost convinced myself it was mine.

A few weeks went by. Deadlines, invoices, client calls. The duck became part of the static scenery, something my eyes slipped over when I stared through the screen too long. My partner teased me about it the one time I mentioned it.

“Office mascot,” she said. “Maybe it’s good luck.”

“Maybe,” I said, even though I do not believe in luck.

Then one Monday, I came in from a miserable commute, peeled my damp jacket off, and found that the duck was no longer alone.

Tucked beside it, nudging its flank, sat a smaller duck. This one was pale pink, the colour of old bubblegum. The beak was painted a softer orange, slightly smudged, as though whoever applied it had breathed too close before it dried. It faced the same direction as the first duck. Their sides touched.

For a moment I thought I was still half asleep. There is a particular quality to unreality on a Monday morning, when the weekend has not finished leaving your system. I blinked once, twice. The pink duck stayed.

The second story that formed was that someone on the floor had seen the yellow one and decided it needed company. Maybe they had found this one on their own desk first and passed it on like office chain mail.

I sat down. My chair creaked in the same tired way it always did, a sound as familiar as my own joints. I studied the two of them. The size difference was just enough to make the pairing feel deliberate. Not two random ducks, but a couple copied from a greeting card. The idea lodged somewhere in my chest that someone, somewhere, thought my duck should have a companion.

You might be thinking that this is where I should have been creeped out. A stranger playing with my desk, decorating my space while I was away. The truth is, my first response was not unease. It was something closer to warmth. I told myself it was harmless, someone being whimsical. I thought, with a kind of embarrassed fondness, that my duck had been given a girlfriend.

If you grew up here, you probably remember the old Englefield ads. Bathroom fixtures and bubbles and those tiny plastic ducks gliding through water that was always just opaque enough that you could not see anyone actually naked. There was a little jingle that went with it, something about rubber duckies making bath time fun. It stuck in your head whether you wanted it or not. Every child I knew at the time had a duck of their own, some direct brand cousin of the ones on television.

That memory came back to me as I looked at the pair under my monitor. The kind of childhood recall that feels less like memory and more like a commercial burned into your brain. I thought of my nephew singing in the bath, lining up his ducks on the edge and insisting they all had names.

Maybe that is why I smiled, just a little, at my desk. I imagine from the outside it looked like nothing at all, one more office worker amused by something on their screen. 

I did not mention the second duck to anyone. There was no one to mention it to, really and I didn’t want my partner to tease me about it. At morning teas, the younger staff gather around the high table near the windows, talking about shows I had not watched and people I did not know. I eat my muesli bar at my desk, the wrapper crinkling softly beneath my fingers, and go about my daily routines.

They had become part of the way I oriented myself to the day. I would arrive, sit, and check that they were where I had left them. It was a pointless ritual, but it made the first few minutes of the morning feel less empty. Two small shapes, bright against the surface of my desk, acknowledging my presence in a way that people did not.

Nothing about it felt frightening yet. That is important to understand. At the beginning, the horror is never in the object. It is in the fact that you talk yourself out of noticing what is strange.

September arrived with a change in the air. I caught what I thought was an ordinary cold. By the second day I could barely stand. Fever, shakes, an ache that burrowed behind my eyes. The kind of illness that confuses time. I spent most of that week drifting in and out of shallow sleep on the couch, sweating through clothes and sheets, grateful that my contract included two weeks of sick leave. The phone stayed off. Work could survive without me for a few days.

When I returned the following Monday, the first thing I noticed was the smell of someone else’s coffee in my bin. A dark ring at the bottom, recent enough that the sourness clung to the air. Someone had used my desk while I was away. It was not unusual; space was scarce on our floor and people borrowed whatever surface they could find.

I sat down and reached for my keyboard. Only then did I realise the ducks were not looking at me.

The yellow one and the pink one had been turned around. 

At first I assumed whoever borrowed the desk had simply found them strange and turned them away. A small gesture of discomfort. I almost laughed at the thought. They were toys, nothing more. But a small pulse of something uneasy went through me, a ripple that I smothered before it could grow.

Looking back now, I understand the truth was different. Someone had been angry.

I picked them up and turned them back, placing them in their usual positions. Yellow to the left, pink angled slightly inward. Restoring the small matching tableau I had become used to. Then I opened my inbox and forced myself to move on.

The following week, a third duck appeared.

This one was tiny, no larger than the tip of my thumb. A bright orange baby duck with a beak that had been painted on in a trembling hand. It sat tucked beside the pink duck. The trio looked like a little family, posed with deliberate care.

I stared at them for a long time. The cuteness of the first duck had been harmless. The addition of the second had been strange but still explained by whimsy. But the third one, this little offspring, felt different. Someone had escalated this. Someone had expectations.

The unease was sharp now. Not fear exactly, but intrusion.

I picked up the smallest duck. The plastic was rougher than the other two, grainy, with tiny ridges where the mould had not been sanded smooth. The paint smudged under my thumb. A little curl of orange flaked away.

I walked down to Jerry’s cubicle. He was one of the only people I spoke to. Younger than me by a decade, bookish, with a stack of sci-fi paperbacks always on the corner of his desk. He was fiddling with a small gear printed from resin.

“Hey,” I said. “Can I show you something?”

He looked up. “Sure.”

I placed the ducks on his desk. He leaned in immediately, adjusting his glasses.

“These are printed,” he said. “Definitely. This layer here is from a cheap printer. See the striations along the side. And the paint is hand applied. Someone used acrylic and didn’t wait for it to dry before adding the detail.” He scraped some from the pink duck with his nail. “Yeah. Handmade.”

My stomach sank.

“Why would someone do this?” I asked.

Jerry shrugged. “Maybe someone is messing with you. Or maybe it’s like a secret-santa-thing. People do weird things in offices. You might have an admirer.”

The idea of having a secret admirer made my skin prickle.

I thanked him, gathered the ducks, and walked back to my cube. They sat in my palm like warm little hearts. Too intimate. Too deliberate.

I dropped all three into my bin. The sound was louder than it should have been, plastic hitting plastic in thud. A small flicker of guilt followed, but I pushed it down. They were toys. Nothing more.

I worked late that night, trying to clear a backlog of emails. By the time I logged off, most of the floor was empty. I packed my bag, took the lift down, and crossed the car park under a sky that looked close enough to touch.

My car sat beneath a sodium lamp. I clicked the key fob. The hazards blinked once.

Then I saw them.

All three ducks sat on the center of my windshield, arranged in a neat line. Yellow, pink, orange. As if they had been waiting. A smear of lipstick had been drawn across the glass, the curve forming a crude heart around them.

The wind brushed against my sleeves, carrying a faint sweetness I could not place. Something familiar and wrong.

The ducks stared at me. Their painted eyes were black dots, fixed with an attention that felt almost human.

Someone had taken them from the bin.

And someone wanted me to see the heart.

I kept my distance from the windshield for several seconds, as if the arrangement might shift if I looked away. The lipstick heart caught the light in a greasy sheen, the smear thick along one side where the pressure had been uneven. I opened the back door of the car, reached for the container of wipes I kept in the side pocket, and tore one free. 

I wiped the glass slowly, pressing hard enough that the smear broke apart into pale streaks. The ducks watched me from where I had placed them on the bonnet, their tiny bodies tipped slightly forward. I cleaned until nothing remained but a faint oily patch. Then I gathered the ducks in one hand and walked to a rubbish bin near the kerb. I dropped them inside without ceremony. The lid fell closed with a soft, final click.

At home I told my partner everything, obviously. She listened while she heated leftovers in the microwave. Steam drifted up from the bowl, obscuring her face for a moment.

“A prank,” she stated. “A weird one, but still a prank. Someone on your floor must have too much time on their hands.”

The explanation was comforting in its ordinariness. I wanted to accept it.

The next morning I went to HR. 

A woman in a navy cardigan took my name and asked me to sit. I told her what had happened, the ducks, the windshield, the lipstick heart. She typed while I spoke, each keystroke a small interruption.

“There are no cameras inside the office area,” she resigned. “Only at the main entrance. The car park cameras have been faulty for months. We are working on that. If someone placed anything on your vehicle, there is no footage.”

I asked whether anyone had been on my floor after hours. She shrugged. “People come and go. Contractors. Late meetings. Hard to tell. We can note this down.”

Her tone made it clear that nothing more would come of it. She folded her hands and gave me a reassuring smile that felt like a dismissal. “If anything else unusual happens, let us know. I am sure this is all harmless.”

By lunch I had convinced myself it was finished. The ducks were gone. The prank had run its course. My desk looked clean, empty, ordinary. Nothing had been moved. My screen lit up with its usual calm blue at the start of the day. No toys. No lipstick hearts. No signs of intrusion.

Two days later my partner called me during a meeting.

Her voice was steady but held something underneath it, something tense. “I got an email at work,” she whispered. “From someone who claims to be in your office.”

My chest tightened. “What did it say?”

“That you have been flirting around. Touching women without asking. Being unprofessional. Strangely, it’s from one of those forwarding accounts you get when you don’t want to give your real email address.” 

Silence opened between us, I knew exactly who I was. I knew what I was capable of and what I was not.

“You know that’s not true,” I said.

“Of course,” she replied, and her certainty was immediate, almost fierce. “You would never do any of that. I told my manager to delete it. It is someone stirring trouble. It has to be.”

Her trust should have soothed me, but something in the back of my mind shifted, a small edge turning.

Someone knew her name. Someone knew where she worked. I had to find out who was doing this.

The email to my partner changed something fundamental in me. A quiet, steady panic began to take shape. I could not shake the feeling that someone on my floor was watching me, studying me, choosing moments to twist.

There were nine women working on my floor. I barely knew any of them. That made it worse. The anonymity created a vacuum my mind began to fill.

I started observing them. Not openly. I watched from my own cube, waiting for any of them to enter the bathrooms. It seemed my only choice, to find something strange in their patterns, to see if they came by my desk thinking I’m not there. Most of them worked on the other side of the floor and constantly walking around would make me seem suspicious. My notes were simple. Just names, or in some cases initials, with times beside them. A pattern refused to form.

The paranoia grew sharper. I ordered a novelty item from an online store, a stapler with a built-in camera meant for streaming pranks. It fed to a simple browser window through the company wifi, saving the footage on my hard drive. I placed it on my desk as if it were an ordinary office tool. The camera captured a wide view to the bathrooms and fire exit. I would catch them in the act, eventually.

Days passed. Nothing changed. Every time I checked the footage, there was never anything unusual. No one standing near my desk. No one reaching over the cube wall. 

By Thursday afternoon, HR sent an email requesting a meeting. My stomach lifted. I assumed they had found something, or that someone had confessed. The subject line simply said “Follow-up.”

The HR office held a different atmosphere this time. My manager sat beside the woman from HR, both of them staring at a single folder in front of them. A company lawyer stood in the corner with his hands clasped. No one smiled.

“Take a seat,” HR said.

I did.

“There have been complaints,” she continued. “Two women on your floor reported that you have been observing them entering and leaving the bathroom at specific times. They stated that you have stared at them in ways that made them uncomfortable.”

She opened the folder. Inside were the pages from my notebook. My handwriting. Names, initials, times, dates. 

“We searched your desk this morning,” she said. “We found these.”

My throat closed.

“We also discovered videos. IT accessed your computer. There is surveillance footage saved locally. You’ve filmed the view beside the women’s bathroom.”

“That is not why it was there,” I said. My voice wavered. “Someone has been tampering with my things. Leaving objects. Watching me. I was trying to protect myself!”

“It doesn’t matter,” the lawyer said. “You violated company policy on workplace surveillance and privacy, not to mention sexual harassment. This is grounds for immediate termination.”

“I was framed!” I yelled. The words sounded hoarse. “There were ducks on my car. Someone drew a heart on the glass. My partner got an email for Christ’s sake!”

HR shook her head. “None of that changes the fact that you kept notes on female staff and installed a camera. We take harassment very seriously.”

They slid a stack of paperwork toward me. Termination forms. A formal notice for security to escort me out. A document explaining that my access card would be deactivated within the hour.

I signed. My hand shook so hard the pen scratched the paper.

When I reached the car, the sky looked blurred, as if seen through water. I collapsed into the driver’s seat and began to cry. Not quiet tears, but a sharp, disorienting grief that left my vision swimming. I called my partner. She answered on the second ring.

“They fired me,” I cried. I kept talking even though my voice barely held shape. I told her about the notes, the camera, the complaints.

“I know you,” she said, but her tone had changed. Cautious. Thin. “But this is a lot. I think I should stay at my mother’s for a bit. Just until everything settles.”

When she came home, she packed quietly. A small overnight bag, the blue one she used on weekends. She avoided looking at the termination papers on the table. 

The door clicked shut behind her. The house felt emptied.

I wish it had ended there. I wish I could say that, truly. I wish I could say she came back a few days later, I found a new job, and everything settled into something ordinary. I wish I could say we laugh about it now. That would be a cleaner story, something with a neat moral edge. You survive something strange, you rebuild, the world rights itself. But that is not the story I am living.

I am sitting here now because our couples therapist suggested I write this down. She wanted a clear version of my side of the events, something I could hand over when the memories become tangled and I start losing track of what happened first. My partner and I have been attending sessions for a couple of months. We still live apart. She says she needs space to breathe. I cannot blame her. My emotional state after the firing was awful. I slept at odd hours. I forgot to eat. 

I still cannot find work. I have applied everywhere. Interviewers want confidence, brightness, energy. I do not have those things. I am living off savings and the numbers shrink each week. I try not to look at them too closely.

The house became something I avoided. Dishes stacked. Laundry sat in piles. I spent entire days in the same clothes. My partner visited once and stood in the doorway like a visitor in a stranger’s home. We talked about a reset. A clean slate. That was before the last thing happened. Before any hope of simple explanations disappeared entirely.

She had been away for a week, staying with her mother, when I found the bouquet.

It was on my doorstep early one morning, the sky still grey with the last of the night. Paper flowers, folded with meticulous care, arranged in a tight cluster. In the center sat a small red rubber duck. This one wore a tiny set of lingerie made from scraps of lace and ribbon, glued unevenly across its plastic body. The sight of it made something twist inside me, not fear but revulsion. A cold, crawling disgust that moved along my skin.

I took the bouquet inside, carried it straight to the fireplace, and set it on the grate. The paper curled as the flames caught, blackening at the edges. The duck melted in stages, its red surface turning soft, then glossy, then collapsing inward.

I started drinking that night. Not much at first, just enough to soften the sharpness of my thoughts. Then more. Days blurred. I wrote a letter and taped it to my own door. I didn’t know who the message was for. I only knew I needed to say something to whatever or whoever had been creeping into my life.

“I do not want you. I will never want you. If I find out who you are I will make your life miserable. I’d rather die than get to know you.”

I really thought then, they’d taken the hint. Nothing happened and I truly felt lighter.

Then came yesterday.

I woke early, a dull ache behind my eyes from too much wine. I stood under the bathroom light and turned the shower on.

When I pulled the curtain back, I saw it sitting in the corner of the tub.

A rubber duck. The size of the original one that appeared on my desk months ago. But this one was pitch black. Not dark yellow, not painted over, but a deep, consuming black that swallowed the light. Its eyes had been painted with white crosses, stark and crooked, the brushstrokes uneven. It faced the wall, its back turned to me.

I didn’t touch it. I couldn’t. My body moved on instinct. I packed a bag. I left the house without looking back. I checked into a small hotel near the motorway and paid for a week in advance. I sit here with the curtains closed and the door secured. Maybe I should call the police. My partner certainly thinks so. 

We had been talking about moving away before this. A fresh start. Somewhere far from the office, far from the city, far from anyone who it might be. Now it feels less like an idea and more like the only option left.

I only know I am tired. Tired in a way that goes past sleep. Tired in a way that makes the thought of leaving everything behind feel like relief.

I really fucking hate rubber ducks. ",3,1763173887.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

⸻

Just got back from an amazing trip to Seattle, and I genuinely don’t understand why so many people in the South (especially Texas) speak so negatively about it. I’ve lived in Texas my whole life, and before going, I heard every stereotype — “it’s dangerous,” “people are rude,” “weather is awful,” “no one is friendly,” etc. Honestly, our experience was the complete opposite.

From the moment we landed, people were incredibly kind. We had conversations everywhere we went — coffee shops, restaurants, even just walking around the city. Locals were helpful, welcoming, and genuinely proud of where they live. It felt refreshing.

And the food? Amazing. We tried so many great places: fresh seafood, breakfast spots, bakeries, small local restaurants, Pike Place Market finds — everything was outstanding. We never had a bad meal.

The views were unreal too — water, mountains, beautiful neighborhoods, clean parks, and you’re always surrounded by nature. Even the rainy weather was relaxing in its own way.

Overall, Seattle blew us away. Friendly people, beautiful city, great energy, great food. It was easily one of the best trips we’ve taken, and I’m really thankful for how welcoming everyone was. 🙌

Just wish people would stop talking so poorly about places they’ve never experienced. Sometimes you have to see it for yourself. THANK YOU SEA!! What a gem you are! ",265,1763173834.0,Seattle,121,0.95,False

On the staffing spreadsheet, I’m still “Senior Ranger – East District.” My badge still has my name on it. But when someone on the radio says “motion alarm, Birch Run,” I suddenly remember the copier is jammed or there’s a training module I should really finish.

The incident report is short.

“September 28 — Ranger Benjamin Ortega responded to motion activation and 911 hang-up at decommissioned Birch Run Campground. Cleared scene at 02:03. No subjects located. Evidence of unauthorized entry, ongoing missing persons investigation.”

Four lines. Suitable for filing cabinets and audits.

This is the rest of it.

Birch Run used to be the busy place.

Families, scout troops, RV caravans with plastic flamingos and those hokey “The Smiths’ Home On Wheels” signs. A paved loop, forty sites, a little amphitheater where someone used to do campfire talks about bears and Leave No Trace. The whole thing sits in a shallow bowl of mixed pine and aspen a mile off Highway 17, between mile markers 142 and 143. The old green “142” marker has two bullet dents that have been there longer than I’ve worked here.

Ten years ago a freak storm rolled off the plateau, dumped too much rain in too little time, and the creek that usually minds its business turned into a battering ram. It ate half the lower loop, took out two footbridges, and undercut the slope behind the amphitheater until part of it slumped. Nobody died, but a couple of tents went for an unexpected swim, and the photos of RVs with water up to their hubcaps made the local news.

The state did a cost-benefit analysis and slapped CLOSED - AREA UNSAFE signs on everything instead of fixing it.

These days Birch Run is technically a “non-operational asset.” In practice that means we use one of the upper bathrooms to store old picnic tables, check the road culverts twice a year, and chase off teenagers who want to drink warm beer in abandoned campsites.

If I’m being honest, for nine and a half years it was just one more place on my patrol list. No special feeling, no ghost stories.

The night everything changed was a Thursday at the tail end of the season. Late September. The main campground at Lake Hermit still had a few trailers hanging on to their spots, clinging to summer. The air smelled like dust and cooling pine. Day crews had clocked out around six. I was at the ranger station finishing a report on a fire ring someone built directly under a low-hanging juniper.

The base radio burped.

“Ranger One, County.”

I clipped my handheld off the charger and thumbed it. “One here. Go ahead.”

“We’ve got a 911 hang-up pinging off the tower by your Birch Run turnoff,” the dispatcher said. Her voice had that half-tired, half-wired tone you get on slow nights when something finally happens. “Call came in at 00:41. Open line, background noise only. They didn’t answer callback. GPS puts it near the old payphone by the Birch Run entrance. You still have a landline out there?”

“Payphone’s been dead since I started,” I said. “We cut the copper five years ago.”

“Okay, that’s weird,” she said, and I could hear her scribbling. “Also, your motion sensor on the Birch Run entry gate tripped at 00:39. That one went to your office voicemail.”

I glanced at the little blinking light on the desk phone. We get deer false alarms a couple times a month.

“Any units closer than me?” I asked.

“Negative. Trooper’s tied up on a rollover down by the canyon. SAR coordinator’s asleep and will bite my head off if I call him for a ghost at a closed campground.”

“Lucky me,” I said. “I’ll go check it out.”

Behind me, the old analog wall clock ticked. 00:49. The fluorescents hummed. The coffee in the pot had gone from bad to something worse; there was already a dark ring burned into the bottom of the carafe I’d be scrubbing in the morning.

“You going solo?” County asked.

“Yeah. I’ll only be out there long enough to tell some kids to pick up their beer cans.”

“Copy, One. Check back when you hit the gate.”

My truck knows the Birch Run road by feel. So do I.

You leave the highway at a brown sign that still says BIRCH RUN CAMPGROUND in faded letters, someone’s stuck a “CLOSED” plaque over it with self-tapping screws. The paved spur turns to rough chipseal after two hundred yards, then to cracked asphalt with grass down the center. Reflectors on the posts are half shot out, half peeled. We keep meaning to replace them; there’s always something more urgent.

At night the road is a pale stripe between trees. Headlights catch the birch trunks and turn them into bare bones. A little rabbit ran ahead of me for a stretch, staying just inside the beam like it wanted a ride.

The gate came up faster than I expected. Two square posts, a galvanized pipe strung between them, a sagging length of chain and a Master padlock the size of my fist. Someone had slapped a NO ENTRY / AREA UNSAFE notice on each post in plastic sleeves. A camera about the size of a deck of cards watched from the top of the right post, red LED winking.

I pulled up short, put the truck in park, and hopped out.

The padlock was hanging from the chain but not snapped shut. The chain itself was hooked, not threaded. Whoever had gone in had tried to make it look closed again.

I lifted the chain off, let it clatter. The sound bounced around the trees in a way that made the night feel more crowded than it was.

“County, Ranger One at Birch Run,” I said into the handheld. “Gate’s been opened and re-hung. No other vehicles in the turnout. I’m going to roll up to the kiosk, see if there’s a car parked inside.”

“Copy, One,” County said. “Time check is 00:57. You solo?”

“Affirmative.”

I eased the truck past the gate and up the cracked entry road. Old reflector stakes flashed, then went dark. The first thing you hit is the fee kiosk and a tiny parking apron. After that, the road turns into the loop.

The kiosk appeared out of the dark like always: a little brown cabinet with a metal roof, tilted slightly from frost heave. The glass behind the bulletin board was spider-cracked in one corner. Inside, the campground map had faded until the green for “trees” and the blue for “creek” were almost the same color. Someone had popped off one of the plastic holders and stuck a faded brochure for a zipline park over the “You are here” dot.

The parking apron was empty. No cars, no motorcycles, no bikes abandoned in a heap. Just old tire marks in the dust and a mound of gravel we’d dumped there a year ago and never spread.

I stopped, sat for a second with the engine idling. The only light was my headlights and the faint reflection off the kiosk glass.

On the inside of the kiosk door someone had taped one of our “Campground Full” tags from back when that mattered. It still had the little tear-off stubs for reserving sites. Every stub along the bottom edge had been neatly torn off.

I don’t know why that detail snagged me so hard. I made a mental note then. I didn’t know yet why it would matter.

“County, no vehicles at the kiosk,” I said. “I’m going to drive the upper loop once. If I see anything that looks like a party, I’ll call for a unit.”

“Copy, One. You are not to enter any structures alone, you hear me? No collapsing bathhouses, no scouting amphitheaters. We’ve been over this.”

“You spoil all my fun,” I said, out of habit more than anything.

I eased the truck forward.

The upper loop lives in that uncanny place between “completely abandoned” and “someone just left.”

The pavement is cracked but not gone. The site posts lean a little, but the numbers are still legible. Old reservation tags ride the clips, some bleached to tan rectangles, others with names you can still read: KHALIL, PETERSON, LIU. The picnic tables are gray and splintery. The fire rings are filled with leaves and pinecones and the occasional glass bottle some kid lobbed in.

I kept the truck in first and rolled slow, windows down.

My headlights washed over Site 3: empty pad, table, fire ring, post.

Site 4: same.

Site 5: same, except the ring of rocks around the fire pit looked… fresh. Uneven ring of rounded stones, some still damp like someone had recently hosed them or pulled them from the creek. No ash in the center. No scorch marks. Just an empty circle, too deliberate.

The way the stones leaned inward bothered me. Like they were all tilting a fraction toward the imaginary center.

I told myself it was kids. Teenagers love moving rocks more than they love anything except leaving trash.

Site 7 had another rock ring. Site 10 had two.

“Somebody’s been playing,” I muttered.

At Site 14 I hit the brakes.

The pull-in, on the outside of the loop overlooking the drop toward the creek, was occupied.

Not by a car. By a campsite.

Chairs—four of them—sat in a semicircle around the ring. Folding camp chairs, the cheap kind you buy at Walmart or Family Dollar, all different colors. An old Coleman two-burner stove rested on the picnic table. A blue cooler sat open on the ground, lid propped back. A lantern on the table flickered on low, lighting the whole scene in a pale, dirty yellow.

Nobody was there.

I killed the engine by reflex and the world dropped into quiet. The little hiss from the lantern suddenly felt loud.

The chairs faced the fire ring but were too close, their feet almost in the circle. One chair had a child-sized fleece hoodie draped over the back, sleeves hanging like arms. Another had a baseball cap parked on the seat. The cooler was full of melted ice water and floating cans. When I stepped closer and shone my flashlight, I could see that the labels were still sharp. The expiration dates on the juice boxes inside were current.

This wasn’t leftover from ten years ago.

“Anyone here?” I called. “Park service!”

My voice fell flat. No answering “yeah?” No rustle of someone climbing out of a tent. The right way to do it would’ve been to stand still and listen for a full minute. I managed maybe ten seconds.

The lantern on the table was an old battery model, plastic base, frosted tube, little dial on the side. The beam from my handheld caught the brand name: RAYOVAC ROUGHNECK. It flickered again, not with the smooth fade of a dying battery but with odd stutters, bright-dim-bright, like someone was blocking and unblocking the LED inside.

That’s when the smell drifted up.

Not rot. Not smoke. Pine cleaner. The same sharp, fake “fresh” the bathhouse used to have when it was still open and the maintenance crew dumped a gallon of concentrate in the mop bucket.

It was faint, but wrong out here. Too indoor.

I gave the site another sweep with my light. No tents. No hammocks. No footprints I could see without getting down on hands and knees. Just the set dressing.

“County, Ranger One,” I said quietly. “I’ve got an active-looking camp setup in closed Birch Run. Chairs, stove, food, but no people present. One battery lantern lit. No vehicle on the loop. Please advise if you’ve got any missing persons reports from the last few hours.”

“Stand by,” County said. I heard keyboard clacks. “Nothing reported in the last six from your area. We had a domestic in town and a shoplifter at the Walmart. That’s it.”

“Copy,” I said. “Any chance trooper could swing by the Birch Run road and sit on the gate?”

“He’s still on the rollover,” she said. “You want me to wake Miller for SAR?”

“Not yet,” I said. “I’m going to finish the loop, check the bathhouse. If I don’t find anyone, then we start making phone calls.”

“Copy. Time check is 01:12. Check in at quarter.”

The farther I went, the more “almost a campsite”s I found.

Site 18 had two chairs and a tablecloth laid out, white with little strawberries printed on it. The cloth was wrong-side up, the tag showing. The edges were folded under instead of hanging. The chairs faced the wrong way, backs to the fire ring.

Site 21 had three sleeping bags laid side by side on the pad, zipped up with nobody in them. Pillows at the top, indentations in the foam like heads had pressed them recently—but when I ran my hand over one, the impression was cold and bounced back too fast, like memory foam recovering from being squeezed while I wasn’t looking.

At Site 24, every item was centered. Chair in the exact middle of the pad. Cooler in the exact middle of the table. Fire ring stones aligned like someone had taken a carpenter’s square to them.

It all felt like whoever had arranged it had a list that said:

CAMP = CHAIR, FIRE, FOOD, NIGHT

and was checking off boxes, but had never actually sat by a fire in their life.

The bathhouse loomed up out of the dark after Site 30, at the bend where the loop starts to drop toward the amphitheater. Single-story cinderblock rectangle, green metal roof, men’s on the left, women’s on the right, “SHOWERS” sign so faded it just looked like white ghosts of letters.

In my headlights, the doors looked shut. The security light over the center had burned out a long time ago. The tiny window fans were dead. It should have been a black, blank shape.

Instead, light leaked out under the men’s side door. Not bright, not flickering. Steady, like a fluorescent or a cell phone flashlight left face-down.

A minivan squatted in the pull-through next to it. Silver Honda Odyssey with an “I BRAKE FOR HIKERS” bumper sticker, plates from our state. The front windows were fogged. One of those little tree air fresheners hung from the mirror, perfectly still.

My stomach tightened.

I pulled up behind it, angled to point my headlights at the bathhouse door, and got out.

The van’s hood was still warm under my palm. Not hot, but not cold-soaked either. It hadn’t been sitting there for days.

Driver’s door: closed. Back doors: closed. No visible damage. When I cupped my hands around my flashlight and peered in, I saw the usual family disaster: snacks in the cupholders, a crumpled map of the state on the passenger seat, a stuffed animal face-down on the floor in the back.

In the middle row, a kid’s booster seat sat empty. The seat belt lay slack over it like someone had unbuckled in a hurry.

“County, I’ve got a silver Honda Odyssey at Birch Run bathhouse,” I said, giving her the plate. “Appears recently parked. Lights inside men’s side are on. I’m going to make entry.”

“Copy, One,” she said. Her voice was tighter now. “Trooper is twenty-five out if he leaves right this second. You do not go in if you hear a domestic; you back out and wait. You hear me?”

“If they’re screaming at each other, I can live with that,” I said. “If there’s a kid stuck in a stall, I’m not waiting twenty-five.”

I walked up to the bathhouse door.

The light under it pulsed once and steadied. When I touched the handle, it was smooth with Pine-Sol residue, the kind that never fully washes off.

The door opened on the second push. The hinges complained. The smell hit me like a shove.

Pine cleaner, stale piss, old damp concrete. The usual. Under it, something else: a faint metallic tang and a whiff of something like singed plastic.

The light came from three ceiling fixtures in a row, flickering slightly. Tubes coated in dust, buzzing. Those should not have been on. Power to the campground had been cut at the main panel when they closed it.

“Hello?” I called. “Park service. Is anybody in here?”

My voice bounced off tile and cinderblock. No answer.

The men’s side had the usual layout: sinks on one wall, urinals and stalls on the other, showers in the back. Graffiti from before the closure was still visible: “LOGAN ’09,” a crude peace sign, “S+J” in a heart. Someone had tagged “FREE CANDY” on the paper towel dispenser and drawn an arrow to the tampon bin. People are imaginative in the most boring ways.

The stall doors were all open.

The first sink dripped. It had been dripping since the last time I’d done a walk-through in March, and probably for ten years before that. Our plumber keeps telling us he needs a new gasket; our budget keeps telling him to get in line.

On the counter by the third sink, someone had lined up three toothbrushes in a row. Red, blue, purple. Their heads all pointed the same direction, equidistant. No toothpaste in sight.

On the floor next to the diaper changing station, there were shoes.

Four pairs, all neatly against the wall, toes pointing out. Two adult sneakers, women’s size, a little dirt on the sides. One pair of men’s hiking shoes, still knotted. One pair of pink light-up kids’ sneakers with tiny rainbows on the sides.

No socks in them. No feet.

I don’t know how long I stood there looking at that row. My brain tried to make it into “family got ready for bed, left shoes there, went to wash up.” But you don’t leave shoes in the men’s side like that. You don’t line them up like a display.

Something ticked in the far corner, metal on tile, soft and quick. Not pipe noise. Something small making contact with something hard.

“County,” I said, keeping my voice low. “I’ve got a family van, an active-looking campsite, and four empty pairs of shoes lined up in the men’s bathhouse. No people present. It smells like someone mopped in here about an hour ago.”

“You’re not funny, One,” she said. “Trooper is en route, SAR pager is warming up. You get out of that building and wait.”

I took a step toward the shower area instead.

Rationally, I know that was stupid. Or at least unnecessary. But once you’ve seen empty kids’ shoes in a line, you don’t walk away without checking behind the next wall.

The showers were in their own alcove: four stalls with mildewed curtains, two on each side, drains in the middle. The floor sloped, slick with a decade of grime.

The first curtain on the left was closed.

The others were half-open, bunched.

If this were a movie, this is the part where the audience would be yelling at the screen. Real life doesn’t come with background music. It just comes with the sound of your own blood in your ears and the occasional drip hitting tile.

I reached for the closed curtain and pulled it aside.

Empty.

No body in the stall. No pile of clothes. No blood.

Just a plastic laundry basket in the corner with a few damp towels neatly rolled, like a hotel. The towel on top still had the fold crease.

I let the curtain fall. It moved sluggishly, plastic sticking to itself.

Something brushed my shoulder.

I jerked, spun, nearly slipped.

Nothing was there.

The air, though, had moved. A slow shift, like someone had walked past quickly.

The dripping at the sink had stopped.

All three fluorescent fixtures flickered at once, a quick stutter, then steadied. The buzz rose a pitch, then settled.

“Okay,” I said aloud. “Okay. Enough.”

I backed out, step by step, never turning my back fully on the room until I hit the outer door with my shoulder and pushed through into the night. The cool air hit my face like a slap.

The minivan sat where I’d left it. My truck’s hazard lights winked, forgotten. The arranged campsites stood in their careful little patterns.

Every hair on my arms was standing up.

“County, One,” I said. “Men’s bathhouse is empty of people. I’ve got fresh personal items and some weird staging: shoes, toothbrushes, towels. I’m going to do a quick check of the amphitheater hill and then get the hell out of here until backup arrives.”

“Language noted,” she said. “Miller’s awake. You’re on a short leash, Ortega.”

“Understood,” I said.

The amphitheater sits below the bathhouse, down a short footpath lined with timbers that are now mostly rot and moss. Four curved rows of log benches face a concrete pad and a metal fire circle. Behind it is a little wooden stage with a roof and a place to hang a projection screen.

When they closed the campground, they stacked benches from the lower loop there. Last time I’d seen it, it was a messy pile under dust and leaves.

Tonight, the path down was clear.

Every log bench was back in its original place. Four rows, evenly spaced, facing the stage. Someone had scraped moss off the tops and flipped the ones that were too rotten. The concrete pad had been swept. No branches, no leaves, no dirt.

The fire circle in front of the stage was full of stones, arranged in a tidy ring.

My flashlight cut across the benches, then landed on the stage.

There was someone standing there.

For half a second, that was the only way my brain could phrase it: someone. Upright shape in the light.

Then the details came into focus.

It was built out of campground debris.

A stack of camp chairs formed the torso, nested together, their legs splayed for balance. Two coolers stood where hips should be. Four folding tables leaned together to make the rough outline of legs. A bundle of rolled sleeping bags was lashed across the top for shoulders. On that sat a cluster of lanterns—five of them, old Coleman fuel lamps and new battery ones, arranged in a rough circle with their glass globes facing out.

All of them were on.

Not bright. A low, gut-level glow from each, so the cluster of them made a single dull corona. Light fell across the benches in a fan.

From where I stood, it looked like a person giving a talk. A ranger in a pile of borrowed gear.

No one had tied this together with rope. There weren’t any obvious straps holding it. The pieces seemed to lean and balance on each other in a way that shouldn’t have held as still as it did.

As I watched, one of the lanterns in the “head” bundle pulsed. The light inside flared, dimmed, flared, not in sync with the others. The surrounding glass caught and magnified it.

A sound drifted out.

Not a voice at first. A murmur. The faint rustle you get when a campground is half full and people are talking at their own fires, layered on each other. Laughter in the mix, kids arguing about s’mores, someone playing music too low to identify.

It seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. Then my ear picked out the source: a cheap Bluetooth speaker wedged on the stage floor by the table-legs, its blue light blinking. It crackled and repeated a four-second loop.

“…no, you had the last one—hey, quit it—no, you had the last one—hey, quit it—”

The same snippet, over and over. Young boy’s voice, maybe nine or ten. The laughter on the loop didn’t quite match the words.

I took a step back up the path. Gravel shifted under my heel.

The whole figure on the stage tilted a fraction in my direction.

Not much. Just enough for the lanterns to throw new angles of light.

I hadn’t seen what was behind it before.

Against the back wall of the stage, in the shadow line, there were outlines. Three. Human-sized. Slumped.

As my light swept, it picked out fabric: a grown man’s jacket, a soft blue women’s hoodie, a child’s red raincoat. They were arranged upright, empty, sleeves dangling. The hoods were pulled up. The fronts were zipped.

Under each set of clothes, at floor level, sat a pair of shoes that matched the line I’d seen in the bathhouse: the adult sneakers, the hiking shoes, the little rainbow light-ups.

Their toes pointed toward the stacked gear figure.

I didn’t go up to touch them. I’d like to say I was thinking about evidence preservation. Mostly I was thinking about my own hands never forgiving me.

The lanterns on the “head” flickered again. The light inside one, a green Coleman, wavered like heat. Around the glass, just at the edges, I saw movement.

Not reflection. Not dust.

Something pale, slick, and many-jointed slid along the inner curve of the globe. It looked like a centipede had been flattened and stretched, its segments pushing against the glass in tiny waves. Where it passed, the light brightened for a heartbeat, then dimmed, like it was pulling power.

The Bluetooth speaker glitched.

The loop hiccuped, then changed.

“…Ben, did you get the—”

My name cracked out of it in an adult woman’s voice, half overlaid by static. It wasn’t my full name, just the first syllable, but it hit hard enough to make my chest tight.

The lantern glow swelled. The gear structure shifted a little more, pieces creaking. One of the sleeping bags at the top slumped and then righted itself like something inside had flexed.

Whatever was in the lanterns moved faster.

The scent of pine cleaner and burnt plastic got stronger.

A spray of gravel shot down from behind me as if someone had kicked it, though I hadn’t moved. The hair at the back of my neck prickled.

There’s a moment on a call when you realize you’re no longer in control of the scene. That you’re not the one deciding what happens next. I’ve had it with drunk drivers, with angry parents, with a black bear that wasn’t impressed by bear spray.

This was different. Less “someone’s going to punch me” and more “something here doesn’t care whether I exist.”

The stacked gear figure gave the tiniest lurch, like it had tried to take a step and hadn’t quite worked out how.

The second lantern from the left in the “head” cracked. Just a hairline. Light flared through it like it was pushing to get out.

I didn’t wait to see what happened if it did.

I turned and ran.

I wasn’t graceful about it. I slipped twice on the gravel path, whacked my shin on a timber, caught myself on a birch trunk at the top. My radio banged against my chest.

“County, One, I’m leaving the amphitheater,” I said between breaths. “There’s… I don’t know how to phrase this without sounding insane. There’s a large structure made of camping gear on the stage, with active lanterns and some kind of… insect or fungal growth in the globes. I’ve got empty clothes arranged like people against the back wall. No bodies. I’m backing out now.”

Silence on the other end for a beat.

Then: “Copy, One,” County said, in a voice that said she was writing every word down even while her brain was rejecting it. “Trooper is fifteen out. Miller wants you at your truck. Repeat: at your truck. Right now.”

“Already on my way,” I said.

As I skirted the bathhouse, every fluorescent tube inside blinked off at once. The seam under the door went from white to black. The humming stopped dead.

The van’s hazard lights flashed once, even though I hadn’t touched them. All four at the same time.

I threw myself into my truck, turned the key, and swung the headlights toward the entry road.

For a second, as the beams passed over the loop, I saw every site that had been arranged—the chairs, the coolers, the sleeping bags, the rings of stones. Each one caught the light at a slightly different angle. The metal parts glinted.

A breeze came down the hill, gentle, carrying the faint sound of something soft shifting. Canvas. Nylon. Tarps rubbing against each other.

I did not look back as I drove out.

At the gate, the chain I’d left hanging loose was threaded back through the posts, the padlock sitting open in its usual place. The camera’s red LED blinked twice, then died.

I pulled through, got out, and snapped the lock shut myself.

My hands were shaking hard enough that it took three tries.

Officially, the search started at first light.

Unofficially, I was back at Birch Run with Miller and two deputies before sunrise, watching our breath in the cold and telling myself daylight would make everything look stupid.

We swept the campground: upper loop, lower loop, bathhouse, amphitheater, creek crossings. SAR volunteers in orange vests pushed through willows along the water. A K9 unit sniffed the trails. The helicopter from the next county over did a couple of lazy circles at mid-morning, servo whine drifting down.

We found the van, same as I had. We found the campsite at Site 14, chairs, cooler, stove, lantern—now dead. We found the neat shoes in the men’s bathhouse, the toothbrushes in a row, the basket of towels.

The amphitheater was not the same.

The benches were piled again, all heaped at one side like someone had broken down an event in a hurry. The stage was bare. No stacked gear figure, no lantern bundles, no speaker, no clothes arranged against the back wall.

We did find a few things that shouldn’t have been there.

A patch of the concrete at the edge of the stage was scorched in a perfect circle about two feet across, as if someone had set a metal barrel there and burned something hot. The blackened area smelled faintly of melted plastic.

In the crack between the stage and the back wall, Miller reached down with gloved fingers and fished out a sliver of glass. It was curved and cloudy, with a thin smear of something pale along the inside.

“From a lantern globe?” one of the deputies asked.

“Maybe,” Miller said. He held it up to the light. The pale smear had a texture. Not powder. Not dried fuel. More like the membrane inside an egg.

He dropped it into an evidence bag and sealed it.

We logged everything. We did the door-to-door with the plate number. We got a call from a worried sister in Tucson who said her brother, his wife, and their eight-year-old had left on a camping trip and hadn’t checked in. Their names matched the registration on the van. We kept looking.

We never found them.

The official narrative settled into place with depressing ease. “Family entered closed campground, possibly via social media tip. Camped in unsafe area. Evidence suggests they may have gone down to the creek after dark. High water from upstream release could have swept them downstream toward the reservoir.”

People like water stories. They’re neat. No monsters, no questions about what else we don’t control. Just current and bad luck.

There’s a line in the final report about “unusual staging of campsites and personal effects, likely the work of unrelated trespassers over years of closure.” It made someone at Region headquarters feel better to put it there. It makes me feel worse every time I see it.

A week after we stopped active searching—the first week of October—I went back once, in the middle of the day, because apparently I don’t learn.

I told myself I was checking the locks and batteries. Making sure the signs were still up. Seeing if someone had broken into the van now that it had become part of the scenery.

It was a bright, thin noon. Aspen leaves had just begun to go from green to gold at the edges. The sky was that high, blank blue that promises colder nights soon. Highway 17 sounded different in the daylight; tire noise has a separate pitch when you’re not listening for anything else.

At the kiosk, someone had flipped the old “Campground Full” tag around so the blank side faced out. All the little reservation stubs along the bottom were torn off again except one.

That one had a name written on it in block letters: ORTEGA.

I stared at it for a while, counted to fifty, then carefully pulled it off and folded it into my pocket. It wasn’t my handwriting. The ink was fresh enough that it smudged on my thumb.

On the upper loop, the sites were messier than before. Rocks scattered, chairs knocked over. Like someone had taken a hand across a toy box.

At Site 14, the cooler was gone. The chairs were still there, collapsed.

The bathhouse was truly dead this time. No power, no smell of cleaner. The row of shoes was missing one of the adult pairs; there was a damp mark on the floor where they’d been, shaped like the soles had been wet when someone stood in them.

I did not go down to the amphitheater.

I stood at the top of the path and listened. Wind in the leaves. A jay complaining. A distant truck on the highway.

Under it, for a second, I heard the faint, tinny burst of a child’s laugh, cut off mid-giggle. Not from the stage. From somewhere between the sites, like someone had turned a speaker on and off.

I walked back to my truck without looking toward where I thought it came from.

We never did get footage from the gate camera that made sense.

The system out there is old. It records motion in twenty-second bursts, overwrites itself every seventy-two hours. That night, at 00:39, the logs say it triggered and saved.

The file plays as fifteen seconds of empty road, headlights just leaving frame, the edge of my truck as I drove in.

For the last five seconds, the chain across the gate moves.

It lifts, droops, lifts again. Not like someone took it off. More like someone underneath it was trying to wriggle out without being noticed. There’s no hand, no body, no shadow. Just the metal rising and falling in smooth arcs, then settling.

I’ve shown it to two different IT guys and one state wildlife biologist. The IT guys shrugged and blamed compression glitches. The biologist watched it twice, frowned, and suggested wind gusts.

There are no leaves moving in the background when the chain lifts.

Nobody’s written anything about that part down. Files are already thick. Budgets are already thin. The last thing anyone wants is a line in a report that says “chain moved on its own.”

So Birch Run stays on the spreadsheet as “Closed — Unsafe Infrastructure.” We tell people the ground there is unstable. That the creek could cut the bank out from under them. That the bathhouse is condemned. All of that is technically true.

We don’t mention the amphitheater. Or the shoes in the men’s side. Or the way campsite setups appear and disappear between patrols.

Every once in a while, a motion alarm still goes off on the gate, usually on still nights. We send the newest ranger out to “take a look,” in daylight, with a partner. They come back with stories about beer cans, graffiti, the usual.

Last month, one of them mentioned seeing a fresh ring of stones around the fire circle at Site 18, no ash, no soot. He said it looked like someone did it just to do it.

“Probably kids,” he said. “Bored kids.”

I nodded and wrote it down like it was nothing.

When I’m honest, I think there’s something in that bowl of trees that hates an empty campground.

I think it learned some version of “camp” from decades of families showing up with their coolers and chairs and plastic lanterns, playing their little songs into the night. I think when the state shut it down, whatever was watching didn’t understand why the pattern stopped.

Now, whenever somebody sneaks in, it studies them. It takes their layout. It copies what it can. It keeps trying to build a full house out of whatever people leave lying around: chairs, shoes, towels, recordings.

Maybe it miscounts sometimes. Maybe it keeps more than it should.

These days, when I’m on lakeside patrol and catch the Birch Run turnoff sign in my side mirror, I keep my eyes on the highway. If the radio crackles and County says “motion at Birch Run” and “911 ping near the old payphone,” I have a sudden urgent need to check the far west boundary fence, or count buoys, or anything that keeps me busy somewhere with other people in shouting distance.

The new rangers roll their eyes. They think I’ve gone soft. “It’s just an abandoned campground,” one of them said last week. “What’s it going to do, bore you to death?”

Miller doesn’t say much. He just glances at me when Birch Run comes up on the call sheet, then quietly assigns someone else.

On the nights I can’t sleep and end up driving, I sometimes pull off at mile marker 142 and sit where the highway curves. From there you can see a suggestion of the Birch Run bowl, a dark patch of trees against slightly darker hills.

If I roll the window down, I can hear the wind and the occasional hiss of a semi on the grade.

Once—just once—I thought I heard something else under it. The sharp little thunk of a cooler lid closing. The click of a lantern dial.

When I got back to the station that night, the coffee pot had boiled itself dry. The ring in the bottom took twenty minutes of scrubbing to get out.

I try not to think about the timing.

I didn’t say my name out loud in the truck on the way home.

1oxfz4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/cf4cf/comments/1oxfz4q/34f4a_southeast_asia_looking_for_emotionally/,34F4A | Southeast Asia | Looking for emotionally intelligent partner open to LDR,"I’m a 34-year-old woman currently based in Malaysia. I have lived across multiple countries (Turkey, Korea, Japan, Malaysia), and my job gives me geographic flexibility, so I’m genuinely open to relocating for the right person. It would be wonderful if you’re also based in Asia so we could be geographically closer, but I understand that’s not always how life works. Important: I don’t do magical thinking or use LDR as an excuse to be emotionally avoidant. I’m genuinely looking for a real, committed partnership, and the distance is a practical reality, not a psychological shield.

**Who am I?:**

I’m someone who contains multitudes. I can discuss Chris Marker and memory one moment, then crack jokes about the latest South Park episode the next. I have a deep, contemplative side that loves art, literature, philosophy, and meaningful conversation, but I’m also genuinely funny and don’t take myself too seriously. I can laugh at my own absurdities and find humor in life’s contradictions. I value authenticity over performance, and I’d rather have one real conversation than a dozen superficial ones.

I’m grounded and present in my daily life. I find joy in simple things like watching birds on my rooftop, good coffee at my favorite café, dancing alone in my apartment, or meaningful conversations with colleagues. I’m independent and self-sufficient; I don’t need someone to complete me or fix my life. I’m looking for a partner to share experiences with, not someone to rescue me or be rescued by me. I’m resilient, empathetic, and kind. I show up for people I care about and I expect the same in return. I believe in fighting for what matters and letting go of what doesn’t serve me.

I’m community-oriented wherever I live. I enjoy being an engaged member of my surroundings and doing good in the world. You don’t need to be as social as I am, but you should appreciate this quality in me.

I’ve done extensive therapy and personal growth work to overcome a difficult background (C-PTSD), and I’m incredibly attracted to people who’ve done the same. If you’ve worked through your own challenges with persistence, therapy, and self-reflection, that’s deeply appealing to me.

**What I’m looking for:**

I’m looking for someone emotionally mature and intelligent who understands what a long-distance relationship actually entails: it requires EXTRA communication and consistency, not less.

**My non-negotiables:**

- **Childfree** (absolutely no room for interpretation here)

- **Emotionally intelligent and self-aware:** ideally someone who has done therapy/personal growth work

- **Consistent and reliable:** someone who follows through on what they say

- **Strong communicator:** can acknowledge vulnerability, discuss feelings, handle conflict maturely without defensiveness or passive-aggression

- **Established and stable:** financially responsible, has their own life, interests, and/or friend groups

- **No substance abuse issues:** occasional social drinking is fine, but no dependency

- **Gaming/internet use is recreational, not escapism:** I’m grounded in real life and need a partner who is too

- **Wants genuine partnership:** someone who wants to grow beside me, not someone looking for a parent/therapist/project

What partnership means to me: Two whole people who choose each other and actively work to maintain connection. We have our own hobbies, friends, and interests, but we prioritize each other and our relationship. We communicate openly, handle conflicts maturely, and show up consistently even when it’s hard.

**My approach to this:**

I don’t use dating apps. I don’t believe in swiping through people like commodities. I prefer slow-burn connection built on genuine compatibility and shared values.

I don’t want to share my photos publicly, but I’m happy to exchange them once we move to private conversation. I like to move to voice messages or video calls relatively early (not immediately, but once we’ve established basic compatibility through text) to see if there’s natural chemistry and get a feel for each other’s energy.

I appreciate people holistically (intellectually, emotionally, physically), and I want someone who sees and values all aspects of who I am, not just one dimension.

**Important notes:**

- I’m serious about my boundaries and standards. I’ve learned what I don’t want from experience, and I’m not willing to compromise on my core needs.

- One-sentence responses will not get replies. If you’re interested, put in the effort to write something thoughtful that shows you actually read this post that took some time for me to draft. 

- Geographic flexibility: I can relocate due to my career. If you’re also flexible or willing to consider it, that’s a huge plus.

P.S. Even if you’re not personally interested but know someone who might be a great match for me, feel free to play traditional matchmaker! If you introduce me to someone and we end up being compatible, I’d love to send you a thank-you gift for bringing us together. :) ",2,1763173608.0,cf4cf,0,1.0,False

What I've found, and I'm noticing other people saying they've found, is that milestones I'd envisioned as being really important are becoming less and less important the longer I am on this journey.

For instance:

* month 3 - How many days? Erm... not sure, I need to ask chatGPT. How did I manage to lose count?
* month 6 - 6 months? Wow, that's (counts on fingers) 26 weeks, right?
* month 8 - I need to meet up with Big Lil Sis\* to collect my token. I must set a reminder in the diary
* month 10 (and a bit)  - Crap, we skipped right over 9 and 10, do we have time to meet up for 11? That's going to be right on top of panto\*\* - why don't we just do the congratulatory thing at rehearsals? What do you mean you've lost the tokens??? you... urgh.
* month 12 (upcoming) - yeah, ok that's kinda important. We'll definitely meet up for that one.

I think there was a moment when I got to six months where it was... not so much ""I've stopped thinking about drinking"", but more like ""I've stopped thinking about not drinking"" - it's not that my sobriety is not an important thing, it's more that it's not *the most important thing about me*. The most important thing(s) about me have become new things. Real things .

*Important things*

Things that actually matter, where my sobriety is taken for granted by myself and others. It's not even discussed, it just *is*. It has no relevance, it has no weight and yet, somehow, it's everything.

Weird, huh? I'm not explaining it well but, one day, you'll notice that you haven't even thought about *not drinking* for a few days. That's the day I think you'll know, like I know, you've replaced the bad habit with good ones.

That day is a good day.

Not because it mattered - but because it didn't matter at all.

\* Big Lil Sis - her and I have... had... a nice little thing where we'd meet on the 2nd of each month for coffee and cake. I bought myself a set of sobriety chips, and gave her to them to keep for me. The ideas is that she'd present me with a token, discreetly of course, marking each month of my journey. We're both just a little disorganised and I think it's actually happened on time twice. One or both of us was late.

\*\* panto - for those of you in the USA, google this. It's a big, very silly, theatre production. A massive British Christmas insitution. I'm taking part this year, on stage singing and dancing as a minor recurring bad guy character. I didn't do it last year, mostly because it very much would have got in the way of my drinking.

Believe it or not, it's actually quite serious. Comedy is hard work! The madness and chaos you see on stage is choreographed down to the finest detail. You get two hours of entertainment in return for hundreds of hours of collective work by a backstage army, not just those onstage. Do go, if you can - support your local dram group, if you have one.

1oxfsyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1oxfsyx/just_did_my_stanford_interview/,Just did my Stanford Interview,"Scheduled for 45 min
Only went for exactly 40 min 

About 20 minutes were him asking me questions and 20 was me asking him

Overall 7/10, I think he had a good impression of me but might not have been the most impressed by me, he didn't ask follow up questions and mainly sticked to the script 

He asked these questions: 
What major
why major
One thing I'd do differently in high school if I started over 
One challenge 
Somebody I look up to 
Distinctive contribution to Stanford

Final Takeaways: 
1. Try to search up your interviewer before hand and PREPARE QUESTIONS, I don't think my interviewer cared the most about me but I made a good impression since I asked questions that were coordinated to his experience 
2. The interviewer knows nothing about you other than your name, so keep a list of things you want to cover and try to make the most of it in part that you talk 
3. Don't take yourself too seriously?? It's a good thing to be human and try to relax, its just a coffee chat

If you are not yet applying, one way to prepare yourself for these interviews are to schedule coffee chats, go on linkedin and ask people to talk to you about internships or profile reviews, ask other people how they got in, start early to build up the confidence, I mean I did it all through hs and it helped",5,1763173117.0,ApplyingToCollege,1,1.0,False

Still, there was a gravity in you, a quiet pull I recognized— the kind of presence that leaves a trace behind long after the moment goes.

⸻

We laughed about nothing, that easy, drifting nothing that only exists between people who owe each other nothing at all.

You offered the first small truths— not heavy, but vulnerable— the kind that open a door without announcing an invitation.

So I let a few of mine slip out, pieces I keep tucked where few look. I waited for the sting. It never came. It simply didn’t matter to you.

⸻

It wasn’t the night— it was the looseness of it, the slack in me I hadn’t felt in years.

You weren’t gentle; you were perceptive in a way that felt almost sharp— a gaze that cut clean lines through whatever I pretended to be.

Not unkind— just unnervingly accurate.

⸻

Maybe that’s why the next moment slipped past my guard.

We were reading aloud, words moving between us light as breath, when your hand found my leg— steady, certain, as if the gesture had been waiting for its place in the evening.

And not until later did your fingers reach my face, brushing hair behind my ear, touching me like someone memorizing something they knew wouldn’t last.

You noticed everything. I noticed you noticing.

⸻

We made a choice that left its weight on me, and I’m still carrying it.

Later, alone, I cried in a way that startled me— not dramatic, just a sudden shattering of something I once thought solid.

⸻

Days passed. I stepped into the cold and let the air straighten my spine.

I ran and felt my voice return. I danced down a sidewalk with coffee warming my hands like a promise I’d forgotten I could give myself.

⸻

And in this unraveling— this slow, honest peeling-back— I’m meeting the part of myself I tucked away for safekeeping.

The part that wants to feel fully, to shape the ache into something, to grow toward the person I keep meaning to become.

It hurts— but the hurt feels like direction.

⸻

Waking up is strange like that: the clarity, the tremor of what comes next, uneasy about the work ahead, yet grateful for the chance to rise into it.

I don’t know you, not really. But for a moment— a brief crossing in borrowed time— we met between strangers, and something in me moved that needed to.",10,1763173070.0,UnsentLetters,3,1.0,False

Doors open at 5:00 PM — come early to hang out, play board games, and meet people before the movie starts around 6:30 PM.

We’ll be showing My Cousin Vinny, the classic Joe Pesci/Marisa Tomei comedy that’s basically required Brooklyn viewing. Marine Park Coffee will be set up like a cozy mini theater with popcorn, water, and a relaxed community vibe.

Since it’s Friendsgiving, feel free to bring a dish, dessert, or snack to share. We’ll eat together before and during the movie — a great way to try some new food and meet new folks.

The event is open to young adults ages 18–35 with a $5 cover that includes popcorn and water. Soft drinks will be available for $1 thanks to Marine Park Coffee.

Whether you’re from Marine Park, Mill Basin, Bay Ridge, Midwood, or anywhere nearby, you’re totally welcome — the goal is simply to create a fun space for young adults to meet, connect, and enjoy the night.

I’m 22 and he’s 28. When we matched, I immediately found him incredibly attractive. He seemed ambitious, athletic, someone who takes care of himself, and honestly the type of guy I could imagine myself with. We talked a lot for about four or five days. First on Bumble, then on Instagram. At least I thought we were talking a lot.

He told me several times that he wanted to see me. He was out of the country when we matched, but as soon as he came back he asked to meet the very next day. I was excited because I thought that meant he was genuinely interested.

The date itself was strange. It lasted maybe half an hour. We met at 9:30 in the morning because both our schedules were busy, which already felt like a weird vibe for a first date. We got coffee and talked, but it was mostly about the gym or working out. I wanted to get to know him better as a person, but nothing really went deeper than fitness talk.

One thing that threw me off was that instead of sitting across from me, he sat right next to me. I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to make things awkward, but it felt odd. I like looking at someone when I talk to them, especially on a first date. When it ended, he seemed fine, but I walked away thinking the date was awkward and maybe he wasn’t into me.

After that, we kept talking but a lot less. Slower messages, shorter conversations. My anxiety got the best of me and I convinced myself he didn’t really like me. Then my birthday came and he reached out again. He invited me to go out on a Friday night and since it was my birthday week, I thought maybe the first date wasn’t as bad as I thought. He invited me out again on Saturday too, but Friday worked better for me.

We agreed to meet around 10 PM after he went to a small event. Then 10 PM came and he wasn’t answering. I waited. Nothing. Around 10:40 he finally sent me a video of him at the party. I was so annoyed and disappointed that I removed my makeup and went to sleep. I felt stupid for getting ready and being excited.

The next day, I went to spend my birthday weekend with my parents. Out of nowhere he was texting me again asking me to come over for a chill plan at his apartment. He said to come around 4 PM, we’d drink some wine and watch a movie. That honestly sounded perfect to me. But I had already traveled and I didn’t want to cancel family time for someone who had already flaked on me, so I said no without giving explanations.

I posted a story at a vineyard with my family. I got pretty drunk because the wine hit me hard, and even though I was with my parents I was genuinely sad about this whole situation. We kept talking a bit after that, less and less each day, and eventually we just stopped. That Sunday to Thursday we still exchanged a few messages but I wasn’t feeling well and was hungover for days.

Two weeks later he messaged me out of nowhere again. He asked how I was and then asked me out again. And honestly, yes, I did want to see him. I still thought he was incredibly attractive, and the little we had talked had made me like him. So I said yes.

We made plans for a Friday night at his apartment to watch a movie. He told me to come at 10 PM again. This time, because of what happened before, I didn’t start getting ready until 10. I didn’t want to be sitting there waiting like an idiot if he disappeared again.

When I arrived at his place, I was nervous and not as natural as I could’ve been. We ended up lying in his bed watching a movie. I was curled up in his arms at one point, which felt nice because he’s strong and warm and it felt intimate in a comforting way.

Then things got weird. Out of absolutely nowhere he started touching me in a really odd, mechanical, uncomfortable way. It wasn’t sensual or emotional or playful. It was just strange. And silent. We weren’t talking, we weren’t flirting, we were just lying there watching a random movie and suddenly he was touching me awkwardly.

I asked him what was going on and he said, “Don’t you want to?” And I honestly didn’t even know. The way he did it made me freeze. I told him I didn’t know, I wasn’t sure. He just said “okay” and stopped.

Then he got up, put on his pajamas in silence, laid back down next to me, and literally went to sleep.

I felt terrible. Not because I wanted something sexual, but because it made me feel unwanted, uninteresting, like I wasn’t even worth talking to. I left shortly after, told him I was going, and went home feeling confused and embarrassed. The next day I tried texting him normally, and he just left me on read.

It’s been over a month now. A few days ago he showed up again on Bumble and then on an ad, and it ruined my mood for the whole day. I hate that someone who wasn’t even really in my life can still make me feel this way.

Another thing that made all of this hit harder is that I’m not the most confident person when it comes to how I look. I know I’m not unattractive, but I’m also aware I’m not the most beautiful girl in the world. And he was honestly the type of guy I used to imagine myself with when I was younger. Ambitious, athletic, someone who works on himself but also knows how to have fun. Not a boring health-obsessed person and not a chaotic party guy either. Just balanced, driven, good-looking. I found him extremely attractive in a way I don’t normally feel for people.

So a part of me kept wondering if someone like him could actually be interested in someone like me. I wanted him to be. And because of that, the inconsistency confused me even more. I started thinking I was the problem. Like maybe every time I try to date someone I genuinely like, it just never works because there’s something wrong with me.

I know it sounds irrational, but that’s genuinely how I felt. And even now, a part of me wishes he would text me again, even though another part of me feels like responding would mean losing my dignity. I hate that someone who wasn’t even really in my life can still make me question myself this much.

We agreed to meet around 10 PM after he went to a small event. Then 10 PM came and he wasn’t answering. I waited. Nothing. Around 10:40 he finally sent me a video of him at the party. I was so annoyed and disappointed that I removed my makeup and went to sleep. I felt stupid for getting ready and being excited.

The next day, I went to spend my birthday weekend with my parents. Out of nowhere he was texting me again asking me to come over for a chill plan at his apartment. He said to come around 4 PM, we’d drink some wine and watch a movie. That honestly sounded perfect to me. But I had already traveled and I didn’t want to cancel family time for someone who had already flaked on me, so I said no without giving explanations.

I posted a story at a vineyard with my family. I got pretty drunk because the wine hit me hard, and even though I was with my parents I was genuinely sad about this whole situation. We kept talking a bit after that, less and less each day, and eventually we just stopped. That Sunday to Thursday we still exchanged a few messages but I wasn’t feeling well and was hungover for days.

Two weeks later he messaged me out of nowhere again. He asked how I was and then asked me out again. And honestly, yes, I did want to see him. I still thought he was incredibly attractive, and the little we had talked had made me like him. So I said yes.

We made plans for a Friday night at his apartment to watch a movie. He told me to come at 10 PM again. This time, because of what happened before, I didn’t start getting ready until 10. I didn’t want to be sitting there waiting like an idiot if he disappeared again.

When I arrived at his place, I was nervous and not as natural as I could’ve been. We ended up lying in his bed watching a movie. I was curled up in his arms at one point, which felt nice because he’s strong and warm and it felt intimate in a comforting way.

Then things got weird. Out of absolutely nowhere he started touching me in a really odd, mechanical, uncomfortable way. It wasn’t sensual or emotional or playful. It was just strange. And silent. We weren’t talking, we weren’t flirting, we were just lying there watching a random movie and suddenly he was touching me awkwardly.

I asked him what was going on and he said, “Don’t you want to?” And I honestly didn’t even know. The way he did it made me freeze. I told him I didn’t know, I wasn’t sure. He just said “okay” and stopped.

Then he got up, put on his pajamas in silence, laid back down next to me, and literally went to sleep.

I felt terrible. Not because I wanted something sexual, but because it made me feel unwanted, uninteresting, like I wasn’t even worth talking to. I left shortly after, told him I was going, and went home feeling confused and embarrassed. The next day I tried texting him normally, and he just left me on read.

It’s been over a month now. A few days ago he showed up again on Bumble and then on an ad, and it ruined my mood for the whole day. I hate that someone who wasn’t even really in my life can still make me feel this way.

Another thing that made all of this hit harder is that I’m not the most confident person when it comes to how I look. I know I’m not unattractive, but I’m also aware I’m not the most beautiful girl in the world. And he was honestly the type of guy I used to imagine myself with when I was younger. Ambitious, athletic, someone who works on himself but also knows how to have fun. Not a boring health-obsessed person and not a chaotic party guy either. Just balanced, driven, good-looking. I found him extremely attractive in a way I don’t normally feel for people.

So a part of me kept wondering if someone like him could actually be interested in someone like me. I wanted him to be. And because of that, the inconsistency confused me even more. I started thinking I was the problem. Like maybe every time I try to date someone I genuinely like, it just never works because there’s something wrong with me.

I know it sounds irrational, but that’s genuinely how I felt. And even now, a part of me wishes he would text me again, even though another part of me feels like responding would mean losing my dignity. I hate that someone who wasn’t even really in my life can still make me question myself this much.

I don’t know if I’m looking for advice, closure, or just perspective. I just needed to get this out of my head.",2,1763172574.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

Hello everyone! I'm letting go of the majority of my Lamy Safari special edition fountain pens (along with a few other pens) because I have too many pens that I can't use them all and I'd rather they go to a good home where they'll be appreciated. I'm including the Lamy converter with the Lamy Safaris since I already bought them to match with the pens (prices listed below includes the converter). All of my pens were purchased directly from retailers - I'm just trying to get the money back I spent on them originally. Also just to note: for all A1 condition pens, I removed them from their box (if I had the box for them) to take a photo in order to show their condition and prove that I own the pens but I haven't used them at all so they're brand new.

I prefer to ship to con-US addresses. I'm willing to ship outside the US but please be prepared for high shipping costs - please message me and maybe we can work something out if you want to buy multiple pens (I don't think shipping cost will be worth it for a single pen purchase unless you're okay paying for it).

For US shipping, I'll be using USPS priority mail (cost varies between $7-9 depending on where you live - please let me know your zip code) and I will offer free shipping if you buy more than one pen. If you want signature confirmation, please let me know since it is an added cost. I'm only shipping to the address listed with your Paypal (for safety reasons) so please make sure your shipping address is correct when you pay. I will not be using Ground Advantage due to issues in the past with lost packages.

* 2018 **All Black** [C - no box] (EF nib) - $15 - I am pricing this very low because I've used this pen a lot and visually, there's no issues. However, I've noticed that the nib seems a tiny bit loose as I write with it - it doesn't come completely off or anything drastic but there's a slight wiggle when writing with it. I haven't tried to adjust the nib at all to fix it because I'm afraid of making it worse so it's up to you to decide to fix it or not. It still functions perfectly fine without fixing it.

What started off with some Google searches and ChatGPT prompts to find local roasters in my area has turned into something much bigger. Over the past few months I created a complete system to track coffee roasters.

[**https://thebeans.ca**](https://thebeans.ca/)

Here's the current state:

1. **It's** ***FREE!***
2. **It's** [**Open Source**](https://github.com/thephm/the-beans) \-- that CoPilot created based on my prompts of course
3. **It's multilingual -** English and Canadian French for now
4. **Search by specialty** like fair trade or single origin
5. **Search by location**, including your location if you share it
6. **See photos and details** (Address, Web site, Socials, email) for each roaster
7. **Favorite roasters -** requires registration
8. **Share** **roasters** with friends and family

I'm just getting started so there aren't that many roasters, it will take time but I aim to have a lot. Starting first in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) in Ontario, Canada.

And here's what it looks like...

1oxfft2,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1oxfft2/7_days_post_op_us_success/,7 Days Post Op (US) - Success,"I'm 7 days post op today and it's crazy to think about last week to today and how fast it has gone. Below is my journey with some tips at the bottom. 

Brief History: Random note is i had excessive burping as a sign prior to finding the stones. I've always been a burper but it got to the point i did it constantly throughout the day and for no reason at all. 1 week prior to my first attack was when I had the MRI scan that showed I had multiple gallstones. Was asymptomatic so my GI didn't think anything of it. My very first attack sent me to the ER. Pain upper middle abdomen just below sternum creeping up into my chest when i laid down. Pain would radiate to my back on both sides just under my ribs. No matter what i did i couldn't get comfy and it lasted for hours. I was scared it was a heart attack. All scans and bloodwork came back clear. No one even mentioned gallbladder. My flare ups were always at night between 3-5am and always woke me up from sleep. After my 4th attack in 2 months, and having read everyone's stories and symptoms on here I knew it was my gallbladder. I immediately messaged my GI at 4am during an attack and said I wanted it out. He agreed and sent me off to a surgeon for consult. He looked at my scans, listened to my symptoms and scheduled me for surgery in 1 week. Which is CRAZY fast for the US right now. But I was happy to not have another attack before I got it out. 

Day of Surgery: Surgery scheduled for 1pm. No food after midnight. And no more water after 9am (was very happy about that). I'm a very anxious person but I've had abdominal Surgery before so I knew what to expect this time around. Prep and talks with my surgery team went smoothly and they took me back on time. Started to get anxious but once I was on the table in the room the anesthesiologist gave me a relaxer. Barely remember anything after that except them telling me to breathe deeply into the mask. Woke up in recovery 1 hour later after some nice dreams. Pain was pretty well managed by the time I was coming around. Just burning in upper abdomen and discomfort from the breathing tube.

Day 1-2: I came home starving so the first thing I did was eat cream of chicken soup with saltine crackers. They gave me Norco and Zofran. Puking is a giant anxiety trigger of mine so even though I had no nausea I took the zofran in the morning after waking up and before bed. The Norco i took every 4 hours as prescribed the first 2 days. Gas pain is definitely a beotch. I took gasx in the am and pm to help but I also got up every hour to walk around for 5-10 min. By day 2 my gas pain was almost completely gone. 2nd day food wise i was already adding in more legit foods but keeping it on the calmer bland side (chicken breast, white rice, jelly toast, soup, applesauce, shortbread cookies, etc). Took a shower end of day 2. First poop did not come until end of day 2.

Day 3-5: After day 2 I stopped taking the Norco and only used it for at night to help me sleep with no pain. I started to alternate Tylenol/Ibuprofen during the day as needed while still doing the zofran morning and night. I worked on day 3 since i WFH. It was uncomfy to sit so upright for 8 hours and my brain was still pretty foggy but i did it. I started to get more adventurous with the food by trying some of my every day meals I would have (waffles with syrup, cheesy chicken tortilla, coffee, Mac n cheese). I aimed for 2-3 new things/ day. Each day I felt my body making huge progress. I would have moments where the pain would come back and I knew i was overdoing it so id listen and rest. 

Day 6-7: No longer taking any pain meds of any kind. No food has been an issue at all yet thank goodness. I went from testing slowly to just eating like I did prior to surgery. I even got to test my Starbucks peppermint mocha which thankfully sat perfectly. I also had a pizza tonight to celebrate 1 week! I do find myself almost forgetting I'm only 7 days post op. I'm trying to go slow and be kind to my body. I listen when it tells me something is a no activity but also push myself carefully to keep getting better. 

Tips:

- They did tell me prior to surgery that it is easier to give you painmeds to get you comfy in recovery. So even if you are unsure what your level is at, it's ok to ask for a little more to ensure your comfort and set you up in a good spot.

- Keep on top of the pain meds! Whether it is an opioid 
or Tylenol/Ibuprofen flip flop. If you get too lax in those first couple days the pain could be hard to manage again. I woke up in the middle of the night those first 2 nights to not miss a dose and wake up in pain i had to try to tame.

- I took 180mg of gasx twice daily. One in the morning and one before bed. Between that and the walking I think it helped my gas pain a lot.

- Take a stool softener or miralax. Your core will be tired and the pain meds cause constipation. The miralax helped it slide right out without any effort or straining which I greatly appreciated. 

- Move, move, move! Get that gas pain out. I aimed for every hour to get up and just walk around for a minimum of 5 min. Day 2-3 I found it felt better walking around than sitting. 

- Have an ice pack for your abdomen. I iced my incisions often and it would give me almost instant relief for my pain at times. If I started to feel pain I knew i went too long without ice. Still icing on day 7 because of how good it makes me feel. 

- A wedge for the bed is very helpful. This helps you not have to engage your core too much getting in and out of bed today first couple days. By day 4 I needed to lay flat for my own sanity. It was rough but doable. 

- Use a pillow or your hand to gently hold/support your core when getting up and down. 

- Ladies get a front clasp bra if you need to contain the girls. Helps when your in pain and stiff those first couple days to not have to reach behind, twist something around, or pull over your head. 

- Go slow and be kind to your body. Listen when it tells you something is a no activity at the time but also push myself carefully to keep getting better and get that blood flowing. 

- Be aware our bodies may not like something we eat. So if trying a new food/ drink maybe try at home first (in the beginning) in case you do need to run to the bathroom. I haven't found that food yet but I'm sure it will come one day lol

All I can say is I don't regret my surgery at all and I'm happy that I had Tamlin (yes i named my gallbladder) evicted. If your anxious that's totally understandable. I was too. But the healing is going surprisingly faster than I expected and really is worth the ordeal to never feel those attacks again. This community has been so supportive and a great resource both before and after surgery. I'm sure im forgetting some things so feel free to ask any question on things I didn't cover :)",3,1763172080.0,gallbladders,2,1.0,False

1oxfd7d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oxfd7d,Movie night eats,"It's movie night here. Pandorum on Tubi. It's a spiritual sequel to Event Horizon. I was looking for something else and stumbled across this one in the stash. It's a 1998? LRP Menu 8 beef with rice. The LRP was the predecessor of the MCW. The mains are all freeze dried and made by Oregon Freeze Dried Company, better known as Mountain House. These folks have been in the game a long time and made mains for the original LRPs used in Vietnam that were given to Special Forces. As you can see, it's a no frills ration containing the main, accessory pack, three desserts and not one, not two but three iced tea drink mixes. The inclusion of these leads me to believe that the cardboard box survival ration I have is from around the same time +- 5 years as the date code starts with a 3. It's an excellent beverage much like the old cocoa beverage powder. The last 2 pics are a very similar drink mix and I highly suggest making it as an iced tea instead of hot. 

I'll start with the beverage since I already talked about it. This is an excellent instant tea with lemon and sugar. It dissolves perfectly even after 30 years and tastes refreshing. I grew up in the deep south and sweet tea is a regular staple. So for an instant drink to slap, as the kids say, is awesome. This is a 10/10 drink and I hope you get to try it. 

I'll go through the desserts next. This menu came with a fig bar, M&Ms and a corn flake cereal bar. The fig bar is just a fig newton but I guess they don't use the brand names because of copyright and trademark infringement. I gave the pack a big sniff after I opened it and was greeted with an old smell. If you haven't had the opportunity to eat an old MRE, I hope you do but be careful and use your senses, when you open it it'll smell old but in a good way. Kind of like an old book. So basically it smelled old but otherwise tasted fine. It was still pretty moist and had a tiny bit of crystalization in the figs. 6/10 for me. Fig bars aren't a superior dessert and are meh even when they're fresh. 

The cereal bars can be eaten as is and or crumbled up with some water to make a extremely small bowl of cereal. I just eat them as is. This one is slightly sweet and a crunchy, crumbly texture with a hint of butter. I don't think it contains any because these wouldn't probably be any good because of it. Components containing milk products usually go bad. The cereal bars are all amazing and try them if you haven't. Especially the chocolate chip one. This is a 9/10 for me. These are some of the best components in US MREs and I hope they bring them back. 

The M&Ms are M&Ms and taste just fine. They held up incredibly well and aren't really bloomed at all. Are fresh ones better, most likely. I don't let it stop me. 8/10 because I like they're peanut ones better. 

The main was beef with rice. I thought it was going to be something similar to dirty rice maybe or like a baked rice with beef. But it was more of a beef stroganoff with rice which is just as good. I included pics of what it looks like in the pack. I'm not a fan of the old school packaging. It's cumbersome and isn't the best for keeping it hot. But it serves it's purpose and rehydrates the food as intended. It called for 10-12 ozs of hot water so I started with probably 8 and let it hydrate for about 10 minutes and added a little bit too much the second time. It thickened up good enough and no numbing on the tongue or funky flavors. It had a wonderful smell as it hydrated. It looks like slop when I traded it up but don't let the looks fool you. This was a well flavored dish that was hearty and has a nice amount of beef in it. Oregon Freeze Dried knows how to make some amazing food. ",12,1763171875.0,MRE,2,1.0,False
1oxfcwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1oxfcwh/girlfriend_not_my_type_23m26f/,Girlfriend not my type? (23m/26f),"I (23m) have been seeing this girl for a long while now (nearly three years), she’s a friend of my brothers girlfriend and it all seemed well, we have a lot of similar interests, I’ve learned a lot from her and she was/is my first real relationship.
I done so much with her, she’s met my family and I’ve met hers (I have a big family compared to her) it’s too the point where everyone associates me with her, every time I see my family I’m always asked about her (even now((foreshadowing)).
The problem is I’m noticing that she’s not really my type, I met her when I was 20 and since she was my first serious relationship I never really thought about it, and I’ve only recently started to notice it. 
The biggest issue I’ve noticed is that there is a language barrier, my first language is English and hers is Spanish, I’ve gotten better at my Spanish to the point where I can hear and speak just fine (reading is my only issue but even then I can read just fine, it just takes me a little longer) the thing is since it’s not my first language I’ve always found myself struggling to truly connect with her, she understands English just fine but there just something different about speaking it with her, this bleeds into another topic/issue. 

A few months ago I met someone who speaks English, we hit it off nearly instantly and I felt a sort of relief that I could speak English with her, conversations just flowed through so smoothly and it honestly felt really good, like something I haven’t felt in a long time, long story short we both started catching feelings for each other and I obviously didn’t want to cheat on her so I broke up with her.
It took me a long time to come to that conclusion and I felt awful about doing it, it destroyed her and I couldn’t help but feel like I was making the wrong choice, even my family criticized me about it (they don’t know about the English girl btw).
Returning to the English girl, we weren’t dating, but we weren’t friends either, well after a few months of on and off, she had to leave the country, and after both agreeing, we ended it pretty well. Now after a few weeks of that happening my ex texted me to give me a letter, and it was such a sweet love letter, basically telling me how she felt about our relationship and how much it meant to her, and this letter hit me hard, I wasn’t in a good mentality since the English girl left and this letter really hurt, I offered to see her for coffee and we both had a really good conversation, but it was clear that she wasn’t well with the breakup. Both of us feeling bad (for different reasons) we kissed, and it was honestly one of the best kisses we’ve had, and from that moment we talked about getting back together.
Now a few months pass and after talking about it I told her that before we get back together and make it official I wanted to go to therapy (something I’m actively seeking out), cause I told her I didn’t feel good mentally, but we could continue doing meet ups.
The problem is now everyone basically sees us as a couple again (not blaming them since I would feel the same way), and though for a while it felt good, I recently started to feel like she’s not my type. Now since I was thinking of the English girl a lot, and since I’ve felt so strongly about that relationship I thought to do the things I did with her with my ex (I know it’s wrong to go out with someone while someone else is on your mind but,) I thought that it would help me connect with her and with what I was feeling, I would talk/joke with her in English more, go to museums with her (since I love art so much), give her some fashion advice (never forcing her of course, she just has a huge closet full of clothes that she never uses and that I’d like to see her wear), write and draw with her, and more. And though for a while it worked, I felt like I was connecting more with her, something still felt odd, and I can’t  stop thinking about it, in a way it feels like I’m just making it up to my family (since they love her so much).
Something I feel like I should mention because it’s something I’ve noticed about her recently is that she’s a very unorganized person, in reality her whole family is unorganized, their apartment is always full of papers scattered around, cloths on the floor sometimes, and dishes filling the sink, now I excuse this mostly cause she’s studying medicine, so it’s understandable to see a bunch of papers or textbooks scattered around, and I know it’s a small thing to complain about but coming from a very strict household on cleaning and staying organized, it’s something that bothers me at times (especially since they always say that one day I’ll ’find the house clean’). There’s also the topic that she doesn’t experiment with her fashion much, like I mentioned before, she had a huge closet full of beautiful clothes that I rarely ever see her wear. She’s also not as energetic as me, I want to travel, and go see places but she told me multiple times that she wants to stay at home, and this extends to small things, I often times want to go see places and be outside but I’d find myself going to her place just to watch Netflix all day, and she’s not as energetic when it comes to other physical activities. Lastly she’s not very interested in art as I am, I listen to music 24/7, I draw and write a lot, and of course go to many museums, and though she’s always interested in what I draw or listen too, it’s clear that it’s something that she’s not fully understanding/interested in, I can’t critique much since the same thing happens to me with her study’s, like I’m interested in it, but I obviously don’t understand it half as much as she does. 

The biggest problem is that I feel like I’ve dug myself a pretty deep hole right now due to the fact that (a little after we kissed) I wanted it to work it out with her, and I went all out, not only doing the things I enjoyed with her, but we also got into a relationship app, one that I thought would help me get that spark back. But since I’ve been feeling this way I don’t know what to do, she recently came over, and I honestly didn’t feel all that connected to her conversations and I was kinda counting down the time till she left now this could most DEFINITELY be because I’m currently dealing with finals, but a part of me feels that it’s for another reason. 
Like I said I want get into therapy before making a final decision, but I feel like everyone (including her) just considers us dating again, on one hand I’m uncomfortable because of how I feel about her, but on the other I really want to work things out, because I truly care about her, with the letter she wrote me, the things she’s doing for me now (she’s been getting a lot more affectionate recently), and overall experimenting a bit more I feel like it’ll be worse to end things now especially with our current relationship status, I told her I want to work things out, and it would kill me if I have to tell her I can’t.

Truthfully I’m lost, and I don’t know what to do, I don’t want to get back together just to have someone who can speak English  come up to remind me of what I want, it sounds stupid, but to me there is such an issue with not being able to fully feel comfortable speaking English with her, and the few other issues I mentioned prior. But I also don’t know if I’m just over exaggerating and I just need to work it all out mentally, please let me know cause I’m lost and don’t want to make the wrong decision.",0,1763171851.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

I recently found out that not everyone has an inner monologue, and it absolutely blew my mind.

For me, my head is basically a crowded coffee shop, it's constant overlapping voices, background chatter, random TikTok/Vine sounds popping in, and none of it is in my actual voice. My brain is never quiet.

So I started asking people around me to compare:

-My fiancée says she has no inner monologue. She has thoughts, but not in a “voice in your head” way.
-Friend One says he has an inner monologue with about five voices, all sounding like him and happening pretty much all the time.
-Friend Two says they have one voice, their own, but it only kicks in occasionally.

The differences are wild, so now I’m curious...

So why should you care about the ristretto on the Pro? It is a shot pulled at a 1:1 ratio within 25-35 seconds. The output should be about 18 grams on strength 3. It will use a slightly finer grind then a standard espresso shot. A ristretto shot will be intense, sweet, syrupy, and taste great in milk drinks. It will cut through milk with more coffee flavor then a standard espresso shot that gets more lost in it. A ristretto has become my staple espresso shot to use in milk drinks now.

Meet Ms Pauline Smith a 38 year old science instructor at UC Davis. 

I got to the Silo Market earlier than usual 8:12 a.m., according to the over sized screen flashing bus times across from me. The air still held that soft morning chill UC Davis is famous for, the kind that smells like damp pavement, eucalyptus, and a hint of cow pasture drifting in from somewhere you can never quite pinpoint.

I sat down adjusting my blue blouse and skirt then wrapped my scarf a little tighter glancing at the darkened windows of the cafe. They wouldn’t open for another eighteen minutes, but I liked these quiet pockets of the morning moments before students filled the courtyard with noise, bikes, and impossible energy.

As if on cue, my phone buzzed.

Ms Mara: Guess who just got promoted to Associate Dean???

I blinked at the screen, my breath catching in my throat. Mara had been fighting for that promotion for months years, really. Late nights, endless meetings, committee after committee. She’d vent to me after work over cheap Thai food, promising herself she’d only stay another year, though we both knew she’d never leave academia.

My fingers flew.

Me: NO WAY YOU DID?! WHEN?!

Three dots appeared, then vanished, then appeared again. Classic Mara.

Mara: Just got the email. I’m still shaking. Had to tell you first.

I grinned so hard my cheeks stretched. The courtyard was still empty, but I suddenly felt like I was buzzing louder than the bike racks around me. “Congrats, Mara,” I whispered to myself, imagining her pacing her office, half crying, half laughing, probably spilling her coffee.



It was 8:40 am on my apple smartphone when the doors to Silo Market finally clicked open. The first barista pushed a broom across the threshold, giving me the familiar nod of someone who knows your order before you say it. I stepped inside, warm light and the smell of espresso wrapping around me like a hug.

In line, I typed faster than my caffeine-starved brain should’ve allowed.

Me: I’m buying you dinner tonight in Old Sacramento. No arguments. We’re celebrating properly.

Her reply came instantly.

Mara: If you insist. And Pauline? Thank you. For being in my corner.

Brenda The barista called my name, handing me my usual morning latte. I stepped back outside and watched the first wave of students roll in like a tide, the morning suddenly brighter, charged, full of possibility.

Funny how one text can turn an ordinary morning into a perfect one.

And all before 8:30 a.m.

My wife is all about “spending time having a coffee in the city“ before we go to the airport, but I’m much more conservative and one for arriving at the airport early and hanging around. My question is about checking in luggage. I can sell the idea to her of going to the airport early, if we know we can use the business lounge.

I wanted to see the Han river in Seoul so I thought a nice cruise song the river in the new hangang river bus would be fun.
It opened two months ago but they closed it soon after as they decided to do extra safety checks but now it’s opened again.
I went from Yeuido to Jamsil which is about 5 stops along the river. The price was 3000 won ($2) so very reasonable.
The service goes from Magok (west of Seoul near the botanical gardens) to Jamsil (East of Seoul near Lotte tower).
Even though I only did 5 stops it did take 1.25hrs so it’s not the fastest service (40 mins by subway) but I wasn’t in a hurry and I went for the view. 
They let you go outside deck on parts of the trip so you get a great view of the river, bridges & towers. I went in October on a sunny day so the conditions were ideal for site seeing. 
There is basic food & drinks onboard that you can buy. Bagel, churros & coffee.
When you get to the boarding station you need to get a waiting ticket from the machine to get in line (there are 2 machines depending on your direction - obviously not at Magok or Jamsil as they are starting points) payment can be done on the kiosk machines or you can pay by Tmoney card like I did at the gate.
I can definitely recommend this trip if you want to see the Han river and Seoul but do it when the weather is nice.
There is an express service but it’s designed for commuters and does less stops.

OL sleeve price $11.50  (10 pods)
2 pods = double shot 
2 x 5 = 5 espresso lattes if I use 2 shots per drink. 
Meaning I'm paying $11.50 for 5 espresso drinks.

Vertuo sleeve price $15.50 (price of most seasonal pods pack of 10)

My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Ideally you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

Whenever I'm in a public place, I don't understand why adults behave antisocially toward other adults, and why it's so widespread.

Adults don't look at other strangers. If they make eye contact, they super quickly look away like they've been caught committing a crime.
They look at their phones. They don't look at other people and don't consider their presence. They behave like others are strangers. They are silent they don't talk to strangers. But they don't seem to be intimidated or scared of being in a crowd, because with friends or family they can be very loud and behave like there are no other people.

Is this some phenomenon? What is it called?
Are there any books about it?
Do people behave this way because they hate strangers?

When I was 18, I moved to a bigger city after previously living in a small town, and the most surprising and also depressing thing was observing how adult people behave in public places.

In high school, people seemed interested in looking around at people. At school, it was a social norm to talk with your class and friends. If you were quiet, you were often not socially accepted and seen as weird.

But in crowded social places like restaurants and cafes, people come and they behave anti-socially. You are in a cafe in a room with other people, and often people don't even look at strangers I don't mean stare, but just consider their presence.

Why is it not a social norm to say hello to strangers or chat? Approaching people has also become seen as something creepy, like they want to call the police.

Why don't people value people?
Am I weird for thinking this way? When I'm in public, I'm genuinely interested in looking around at people—not staring, but looking at them and watching how they behave, what they are wearing. I'm guessing who they are. It just interests me.

But I think other adult people don't think about strangers this way. They stare at their phones and don't even look at the people around them for a second, just out of curiosity.

I don't like to go to coffee shops alone because of that depressing feeling of seeing people who behave like bots, not interested in what's around them.

When I was a kid, and when I observe other kids, they are often curious about people. Making friends was easy and natural. But when I entered adulthood, I see adults being antisocial.

For example, they behave at work in a super friendly way and put on a mask of being a friendly coworker to everybody in the company, even strangers from different departments.
But in public spaces, they behave toward each other with hostility. The silence and not acknowledging even the presence of other people, not being interested in them, is so depressing when I observe society in a big city.

ANYWAY. Onto the waterfall of compliments: I've been here for a little over a month and did not know a place like this existed. I have yet to meet a single person who isn't wonderful - even the occasional grump is nice. The values of the community overall paired with the fact that there seems to be an actual effort to protect greenery and not let things fall into a state of disrepair is kind of insane.

Trump directs the Justice Department to investigate Epstein ties involving major political and financial figures
Trump instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to launch an inquiry into Epstein’s connections with powerful individuals, focusing largely on Democrats even though the released House Oversight emails referenced names from both parties, including Trump. Bondi assigned the review to U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, and those mentioned have denied wrongdoing while repeating earlier regrets about any association with Epstein. The move has drawn attention because in a normal administration it would be extraordinary for a president to call for a criminal probe into political opponents while facing scrutiny related to the same controversy. This has made the wider concerns about a potential cover up even more intense.

Hey folks, on my last night and after five nights at Unico 2087 I have some thoughts I’d like to share. I originally chose this resort because I was a big fan of Excellence Playa Mujeres (I’ve been twice) and I heard that this was a more relaxed resort with better food and drink. Aside from that, my only other experiences at all inclusives were when I was a child, and so I don’t make comparisons to that. This probably won’t be in any particular order, but I’ll try to be organized as best as I can.

#Check In

For some reason, the check-in process takes a really long time. Like over an hour. Multiple people come to you to explain things that you can easily figure out on the website like the hours of the restaurants and where the spa or pools are, and to get you to come to a marketing pitch in exchange for some goodies (resort credit, free couples’ massage, etc). After many hours of travel, what I wanted most was to get something to eat and to lie down, not sit on a couch talking to multiple people about redundant topics.

At this point, you’re introduced to a “host”, who describes himself as a personal butler and you can exchange contact information with them to Whatsapp you. This is the first part of what I would describe as “service theater” - the illusion of better service that actually makes life worse and more inconvenient than it should be. More on this later.

# Marketing Pitch and Spa

We were told that the marketing pitch would take an hour, and in return, we would be granted a 50 minute couples massage, $1500 in resort credit, and a $500 voucher for a return visit in the next year. I’m fairly good at saying no to things, so we agreed to participate the next morning.

The pitch was kind of confusing. As far as I understand, for about a $230 USD/month subscription fee, you get about a 30-50% discount on rooms at all the properties under Unico’s parent company’s umbrella and one year of a separate subscription service that allowed you to get discounted rates at a bunch of hotels. Nothing was said about what the minimum term of the “subscription” was, and we were only spoken to in terms of monthly fees. Part of me wonders if you were locked into twenty+ years of payments. We refused this one, and the sales guy’s manager came over and offered us a one-time flat $14000 USD fee for a package I don’t really remember anymore.

We then were moved over to “check out”, at which point a third sales person masquerading as the “check out” person offered us another deal where if we put $300 USD down, we could get a fairly discounted rate for a single stay at Unico again in the next year, which we also refused.

Turns out that resort credit isn’t a credit, but rather $1500 worth of a 65% discount on the spa/golf, so it’s not like you can get away with paying nothing. The entire pitch took about 90 minutes, not the 60 that was promised. We booked our free massage and went on our way.

The actual massage was fine, noting to write home about. But it is actually completely mind-bogglingly insane that a couples’ massage, standard price, costs 610 USD. That’s more than a night at the resort itself. Our theory was that the spa basically just existed as an incentive for people to participate in the sales pitch and/or to pretend that the resort credit is actually a good deal. Remember that after the credit “discount”, this is still about 200 USD/hour, which is a little steep even for higher-end massage clinics back home in Toronto.

#Service and Entertainment

I want to complain heavily about the “host” service. To me, this is basically a concierge that you can text, but worse. He sends you a message in the morning with the activities that are going on for the day (which you can look up online) and handles reservations at the restaurants for dinner.

You can do walk-ins at the restaurants, but reservations are recommended. There is absolutely no reason that the “host” needs to exist. If they used some electronic reservation system like Resy, life would actually be a lot easier, as he has to read your message, attempt to make the reservation, and come back to you if a time slot is not available. He is also only allowed to make one reservation a night (some days we do an early and a late dinner).

He also has next to no information about anything. We attempted to go to a scheduled dance lesson, and there was no instructor there - the itinerary did not say anything about needing reservations or notifying anyone that we wanted to go. I asked the host about what happened and asked if we needed to let them know next time (twice!) and he said he would look into it and never responded with any additional information.

This is what I mean by “service theater”. Why does this guy exist? It made no sense to me.

In addition, there was also one afternoon where we wanted to use the outdoor tub but we had spent a while in it the night before and wanted to get it cleaned. We called the housekeeping line and they told us they would send someone. We waited an hour and a half before deciding to go to lunch only to find that they were cleaning it as we came back from lunch. So 2.5+ hours after we called them. They probably didn’t even notify anyone and just kept to their regular cleaning schedule.

Again, why does that line exist? Why answer the phone and tell us something is happening when it isn’t? Service theater.

Poolside service is okay and in-restaurant service is okay as well, albeit a bit slow at times.

The rest of the entertainment is extremely minimal. No live shows, little in the way of sports, and definitely no interesting guided activities. You can easily take a look at the schedules on the website and decide for yourself if there are things you’d want to do. Most days for us, there was only one activity or zero that was of actual interest.

# Food and Drink

The drinks are generally good. Bartender at the Balam Bar made good ones, and each restaurant has a special cocktail menu, many of which are quite tasty. There’s a guava drink at the Mexican restaurant, a spicy drink at 2087, coffee martini style one at the Italian restaurant, etc. Many were good, and the alcohol quality is solid, with recognizable brand names likes Grey Goose and Bombay Sapphire available at most of the bars.

Oddly, there is no hard liquor at all in the rooms, only a couple cans of Corona. As someone who likes to make a simple mixed drink and sit in a tub, I wasn’t a fan of having to go specifically down to a bar to get anything that wasn’t just a beer.

Food is hit or miss, just like Excellence. I saw reviews claiming the food was much better, but I think perhaps at best it is marginally better. 

The French restaurant is probably the best of the bunch, especially as it’s newer so I suspect they’re stricter about the quality, but even then only about half of the dishes I would say were good with no major flaws. At other restaurants, individual items could range from anywhere between great (smoked marlin tostada) to good (ribeye steak) to awful/inedible (jicama and orange salad that was literally just those ingredients in a bowl with no dressing or seasoning or whipped gelatin orange dessert). But even of those items, it seems to be dependent on the day how good they are. When we went back to the Mexican restaurant, the smoked marlin tostada was good, but not nearly as good as the first time we ate it. Room service is mediocre, and somewhat slow - takes about 70 minutes for an order to arrive.

As we’re both ethnically Chinese, we never eat at any of the pan-Asian restaurants at resorts as we find that Mexican interpretations of generic Asian/non-regionally-specific Asian food is generally terrible. We saw some pretty horrifyingly-dense looking sushi rolls being ordered by others at the 2087 Restaurant - and of course, it was covered in some kind of spicy mayo or sauce.

# Rooms

Bed is comfortable and AC works well. Blackout curtains do their job. Shower has one rainfall head and one regular showerhead. Nothing to write home about. Soundproofing, at least from outside noise coming in, is extremely lackluster. It is very easy to hear people talking in the hallways, room service being collected, and the coatis chirping as they fight over scraps. The coatis are cute as hell though.

I don’t like that the rooms have no room service “box”, and so all room service orders need to be brought in by someone. Sitting around in your underwear and receiving food is definitely not an option here.

Outdoor tub is clearly old (some of the outside is flaking and it’s clear the spouts had been re-caulked numerous times) but I loved it, it’s spacious and the water temperature control is good. That said, whether it’s generally useful or not is probably dependent on the exact room you get. Most rooms’ balconies are entirely clear glass, and so it’s possible you could get very little privacy using the outdoor tub.

However, we were lucky, and our room’s balcony was solid stone with a planter above it, which meant I could use it naked without worrying too much about flashing anyone down below.

Obviously, we didn’t have a swim up room, but I think the swim ups here look very not worth it. It’s not really connected to a pool, it’s more like being connected to a large fountain. Far cry from being on the “river” at Playa Mujeres.

#Pools and Atmosphere

There are two general pools - a “loud” pool in the middle of the resort, and a “quiet” pool on the right side.

For some strange reason, the loud pool has darker paint and is warmer, but the quiet pool is lighter coloured and colder, which made a difference for us when the weather was mostly 20 to 27 degrees. I would have preferred the other way around.

There is no enforcement of the quiet portion of the quiet pool. There was a day where a large pack of mid-50s Americans brought their Bluetooth speakers to the quiet pool and basically took over the area blasting shitty country music and yelling at each other.

In general, there are many large groups at the resort, and they also host weddings with outdoor receptions. I had heard this was a quiet resort, and so this was a huge and disappointing surprise for me. There is no avoiding large groups of boisterous people here.

I also didn’t realize it until I came here, but when the pools are just… pools rather than being interconnected, it’s actually way more boring to be in them. At Playa Mujeres, my fiance and I would grab a floating bed thing and I’d push her along the river portion or generally just move around, and so we could avoid any loud crowds or move along with the shade of the trees and at least have some sense of “doing something”, and we could do circles happily for multiple hours. No such luck here. If there are annoying people around, or if the sun is beating down on you, there’s not much to be done about it aside from leave and go back to your room. We spent a lot more time than we wanted in our room instead of by the pools for this reason.",9,1763170419.0,AllInclusiveResorts,1,0.85,False

I’m a female solo traveler and I was trying to stay within a budget. I did not rent a car but used shuttles to get around. 

Accommodations:

San Ignacio: Arnold’s Guesthouse - this is a family owned business with very nice people. The breakfast was delicious and the front desk staff was very helpful. They can assist you arranging tours if you didn’t book already. My room was clean, had a small refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker. Also had a porch and hammock. I would stay here again, and it was close to everything. 

Hopkins: White Horse Inn - this was a nice hotel on the beach. It had a little kitchette as well. The hotel staff seemed very accommodating. The hotel was centrally located and I would also stay here again. 

San Pedro: Tropical Dream Villas - nice apartment close to town and quiet atmosphere. This one bedroom unit comes with a full kitchen and complex offers washer and dryer. The property manager picked me up from water taxi and dropped me off at airport. The staff is very friendly and I would also stay here again. 

Shuttles:

Brreez shuttle (WhatsApp: 501-676-0909) - this is a small business and I didn’t know much about it when I booked my shuttle. This turned out to be a hidden gem. The shuttle driver Austin is very nice. I contacted many shuttle companies and he had the best prices out of the ones I contacted. He was a safe driver, respectful, reliable, and provided a clean shuttle van. He was very accommodating to extra stops along the way. I gave him anticipated stops for Mayflower Bocawina, Marie Sharps, and Belize zoo and he planned the route perfectly and I made it to the water taxi in plenty of time. I would recommend him to anyone. 

Abe Gutierrez (WhatsApp: 501-666-3426) - Abe had a lot of positive Google reviews and I can see why! He was very kind and helpful. We had a wonderful conversation on our road trip from San Ignacio to Hopkins and I learned so much about Belize and the culture. The price for the shuttle service was very reasonable for an all day road trip. We stopped at several sites (Lamanai chocolate tour, Herman’s cave, inland blue hole, Berta’s tamales). I’ve only ever had Mexican tamales so I’m so glad I tried Belizean style tamales! They were incredibly delicious and completely different from other tamales. I think these are my new favorite tamales! I accidentally forgot my cellphone when we stopped for tamales and Abe went back to get it. He was so nice about it! And Berta saved it for me, which was so amazing to see people’s kindness!

Activities: 

ATM cave - I did this tour with Fearless Belize (WhatsApp: 501-615-4072) McFrankie was great about organizing everything and communicating about last minute changes. He was very accommodating. My guide on the ATM tour was Akeem and he was very knowledgeable. He could see that I was up for a challenge and he took me on the adventurous route in ATM cave. This tour was incredible and I highly recommend it. It could be considered physically challenging for some people (hiking, swimming, climbing, and tight places), but I loved every minute of it. 

Cahal Pech - this site was near my hotel and I just walked there and explored it on my own. It was great to see and read about the Mayan people. In order to get to the ruins, you have to walk up a steep hill. I would probably recommend a taxi to get up there and walk back down unless you really like walking uphill. 

Caracol and Mountain Pine Ridge (MPR)- I wanted to find a company that would do a combination tour of Caracol and MPR. I wanted to see Rio Frío Cave, Río Frío Pools, and Big Rock Falls. Most of the companies that I contacted said that they only visit Caracol and one or two of the sites in MPR. I booked with Belize Caving Expedition (WhatsApp: 501-670-0746) and they offered this tour at a good price. The reservation team said that they would be visiting Caracol and all three locations in MPR, but when I started the tour, the tour guide said they don’t typically do all three sites for MPR. Angel did end up accommodating it and I appreciate him taking the time to show me those sites. I wish there was better communication between the reservation team and the tour guides so people know exactly what they should expect for the tour. Overall, I had a good experience with this company. I learned a lot about the Mayan ruins and walking up and down all the stairs to get to Big Rock Falls was definitely worth it! I also used this company the next day on another tour and had the same guide Angel. 

Xunantunich and Cave Tubing - I used Belize Caving Expeditions for this tour. I was traveling by myself so it is sometimes difficult trying to get a confirmed tour. They booked a private tour for me but offered a discount so it wasn’t as expensive. It was nice to see some differences in the Mayan sites and I enjoyed doing a private tour and going at my own pace. I’m glad I also did the cave tubing tour. It was beautiful and relaxing. This company gets off the tube and walks into a crystal cave and we explore the cave and then go back on the tubes. My understanding is not all companies offer this so I’m glad I was able to see crystal cave as well.

Lamanai Chocolate Tour (WhatsApp: 501-635-1016) - this is a small business, a very nice tour, and the perfect start to a road trip from San Ignacio to Hopkins or Placencia. The guide explained how the Mayans used various plants for healing. She gave me samples of different flowers and leaves to eat or make tea out of. She walked me through the cacao process and let me try making the chocolate. It was hard work. I tried various different chocolates and stages of production. I had the chocolate drink that the Mayans made and ate a chocolate bar. 

Island Hopping and Snorkeling tour out of Hopkins with Sea Ready Adventures (WhatsApp: 501-6557128) - this was a really fun tour. It’s a family owned business and they take you to several different islands where you can walk around and explore plus you visit two snorkeling spots. We saw some marine life and kicked back, relaxed, listened to island music, and had lunch on one of the islands. I highly recommend it. 

Marie Sharps - I did a short stop here to sample their products. This was about 30 minutes for the sample tour. They also offer a longer tour that explains their production process. I had not heard of this company before. I found out about it after arriving in Belize. I really enjoyed it and purchased some of their sauces to bring back home for friends and family. 

Belize zoo - I loved exploring the zoo and I did the jaguar experience which was so worth it! I met a jaguar named Eddy and he was so beautiful. I am grateful so see such an amazing creature up close. I highly recommend this place and I’m so glad I was able to fit it in! This is not your typical zoo. The animals come there when injured and they do their best to help them and get them back in the wild.

Salt Life Eco tours in Caye Caulker (WhatsApp: 501-635-5624) - I chose this company because they have a snorkel tour that visits 7 different sites. The crew really made the experience memorable especially Chris who just had such a great attitude. This company also offers free go pro pictures of your tour. Swimming in shark Rey alley and Hol Chan was a big highlight. We saw lots of marine life and coral. We finished the tour off with exploring a shipwreck which was also cool. 

Massage: 
Thai Spa San Pedro (WhatsApp: 501-635-9284) - this was a great massage that included some Thai stretches. Google maps shows the wrong location for this. If I remember correctly, it’s near “Island City Supermarket” and “Sugar Shack Ice Cream”.

Ana (WhatsApp: 501-625-7928) - she brings massage table to you and does a good massage. Very reasonably priced and perfect for a rainy day. 

FYI:
~~~Bathrooms are a little different in Belize. Put toilet paper in the waste bucket not in the toilet. Most places do not have bathtubs only showers. The shower water is lukewarm not hot. If you get hot water, it only lasts a minute or two. 

~~~If you’re looking to do tour in Belize, you have a few different options:

1. Rent a car or book a shuttle driver who provides only driving services (pick up and drop off similar to Uber). You can ask the driver to take you directly to the tour site and there are guides that you can book right there. The shuttle driver can wait for you to finish the tour and take you back or wherever you want to go. Depending on your situation, this might be more affordable than booking with a tour operator. Although you can find guides at most places, you need to arrange ATM tour ahead of time with tour operator.

2. Some shuttle drivers are also tour guides. They can customize a private tour for you.

3. Book with a local tour operator who provides transportation, entrance fees, tour guides, lunch…ect. Depending on your situation, this could be an affordable option and it’s all inclusive. 

I hope this information helps someone out there! Best of luck with your Belize travel plans. Have an “unbelizeable” time!",1,1763170347.0,femaletravels,1,1.0,False

Then it was just my friend and I alone. He asked if I wanted anything and that he was going to pay for it. I’m not going to turn down free food so I ordered and thanked him. When it was just the two of us waiting for our stuff he asked for something in return. He told me that he liked me and asked if I wanted to go on a date sometime. I said yes and he said I was cute because I was shy and blushy. After that like 2 minutes later I told him that I was saving myself for marriage (sexually) and I told him that it’s okay if he wants to take a step back and just be friends.

Okay so it’s Thursday. We were chatting about rice and I asked if he still wanted to get coffee this weekend and he replied:

“And of course!!! We might not be compatible with some things, but I still wanna spend time with you 😁”

- Is shaving a bad idea? Will it trigger anything? Can I use the same razor on my whole body?

- Do foods actually trigger outbreaks? Will I have to stay away from coffee and nuts my whole life? Or just during an outbreak?

- Am I able to use the same towel on my whole body or is it a good idea to not? I’ve been washing myself with a glove when it comes to down there since I work in physical labor with my hands and am afraid of somehow autoinnoculating a cut on my hand. Is that even possible?

- If you have ghsv-1, personally how many outbreaks did you experience in the first year? Have you ever given it to anybody accidentally?

- How do I know when everything’s gone? I can’t see any topically but what if there’s still some on my cervix that I can’t see?

# Key Features

* **Portability:** Weighs about 3.2kg and is small enough to fit into a backpack. The built-in handle and durable design make it easy to carry to campsites, tailgates, or outdoor workspaces.​
* **Output Capacity:** 300W sustained output (600W surge). It’s best suited for devices under 300W like phones, laptops, cameras, Bluetooth speakers, and small fans, but not high-draw appliances like coffee makers or heaters.​
* **Charging Options:** Can be charged using its AC adapter, USB-C PD input (up to 60W), or with solar panels thanks to MPPT technology. Charging time can be reduced to two hours using the wall charger and USB-C together.​
* **Pass-Through Charging:** Supports simultaneous charging and output, which allows it to function similar to a UPS for sensitive office equipment.​
* **App Support and Quiet Operation:** Newer Explorer 300 Plus model can be remotely monitored via an app and operates quietly—useful for camping or quiet environments.​

# Performance

* **Battery Efficiency:** The AC inverter delivers about 85% efficiency, with real-world usable capacity at around 250Wh when running AC devices​
* **Device Charging:** Can recharge a smartphone over a dozen times, a laptop three times, or run a Bluetooth speaker for up to 18 hours, making it ideal for multi-day trips.​
* **Solar Charging:** Portable solar panel option available, but charging speed is slow (\~6-9 hours for full charge on a 100W panel).​

# Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

* Compact and lightweight design​
* Multiple output ports (2 AC, 1 DC, 3 USB including PD and Quick Charge).​
* Fast recharge with combined AC and USB-C input.​
* High build quality and solid reliability.​

**Cons:**

* Cannot power devices above 300W (e.g., coffee maker, heater).​
* No built-in flashlight.​
* Proprietary solar input may limit compatibility with non-Jackery solar panels.​
* Display AC output measurement can be slow to update.​

# Value and Who Should Buy

At around $299, the Explorer 300 is a strong value for those needing reliable portable power for phones, cameras, drones, and laptops during camping, outdoor events, or as an emergency backup. It’s not meant for high-powered gear but excels at keeping essential electronics running off-grid or during outages.​

The Jackery Explorer 300 is highly recommended for light to moderate portable power needs, especially for camping, road trips, and small device charging. Its blend of portability, versatility, and price makes it a standout option for families, photographers, campers, and travelers looking for a compact backup power solution.

Hi, it’s Josh!

When I finished my book (order my band bio about The Apples in Stereo at http://applesbook.com!) I wanted to dive right back into the long-ish (long-ish is an understatement this time around!) pieces I had been writing under the pedantic guise of “movie review.” I see that the definition of pedantic (I double-check when I use a word that I think I know the meaning of, while also realizing that I am not entirely sure!) includes the concept that paying great attention to detail in the way I do could be considered annoying. Well, frankly, I want to appeal to people who would find what I am about to say annoying. These are people who ultimately appreciate my way.

Nine thousand words!

I went right back into movie reviews and chose the new Spike Lee film, HIGHEST 2 LOWEST, to start off my post-book work. I have been a life-long fan of Spike, and I felt like this experience would be a sort of homecoming to the Jacob Burns Film Center, where I do all of my “serious” film watching (as well as my “serious” film criticism!) My criticism tends towards the extremely critical. In fact, I am still mad at Bradley Cooper for MAESTRO. You can read all about it on my Substack. Subscribe at http://superjews.substack.com. Honestly, I felt a rush of blood to the face just now typing the word MAESTRO!

When I do these extended “movie review” pieces, I don’t leave well enough alone. I take “watch-along”-style notes during the film with my little pen and little notebook, I shoot video starting from the moment I walk out of my co-op door and through the entire writing process of the article, and I voice the final piece to distribute as a podcast, complete with exclusive intros and outros, sound effects, etc. To put it another way, I strive to provide value for your time. We are here together, after all.

To encapsulate these various forms that my work takes, I am now calling this review series “Josh Bloom’s ‘Right On Time’ Recaps” because, frankly, as is the case with the piece I am introducing to you now, I am unable to publish this work concurrently with the film I am discussing. Obviously, this title is facetious. If you are new to me, you will see that this is how it is meant to be. 

Again: Nine thousand words!

As it turns out, the “Come With Me To See” video that you are about to watch, which stretches past the 90-minute mark as if it were a feature-length film itself, is only partially about the film I intended to discuss. I reveal and confront some ongoing family issues, primarily motivated by a confrontation on the day I embarked on this movie-watching journey. I also spend an inordinate but still necessary amount of time discussing my strategies surrounding the purchase of, anomalies associated with the preparation of, and condiment accompaniment inherent in the reality of today’s modern McDonald’s McMuffin discussion.

You don’t think you need this information. I believe you will change your mind.

Oh, and of course, I do discuss the film at the heart of this project, Spike Lee’s HIGHEST 2 LOWEST, but also the film’s inspiration, Akira Kurosawa’s HIGH AND LOW. Contained within this 90-minute-plus video is my reading of the nine thousand words. You can also hear the piece via The Josh Bloom Podcast feed at https://pod.link/1775967463 or within the original post on Substack. 

I am thrilled to be doing this kind of work, and I am excited to offer you the opportunity to enjoy it, so enjoy it!

1oxeh0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/ContentMarketing/comments/1oxeh0n/navigating_communication_in_times_of_distress/,Navigating Communication in Times of Distress,"""One of the biggest mistakes we make is attempting to communicate with someone in acute distress; clarity and understanding are often lost in the chaos of emotions.""

One of the biggest mistakes we make is trying to communicate with someone in acute distress. It’s like trying to teach a cat to fetch—noble effort, but you’ll just end up with scratches and a lot of confused meowing.

Picture this: your friend just spilled coffee on their laptop and now believes it’s possessed by demons. You swoop in like a superhero, ready to save the day. But instead of clarity, you get a whirlwind of emotions that could rival a soap opera. “Why didn’t I get decaf?!” they wail. “My whole life is ruined!” 

Now, here’s where it gets tricky. You try to offer comforting words like, “It’s just coffee!” But they hear, “You’re just a coffee-spilling failure!” Cue the waterworks and dramatic fainting spell—right into the pile of soggy napkins.

In these moments, understanding is about as elusive as a unicorn at a tax seminar. Emotions are flying around like confetti at a parade—colorful but utterly chaotic! You might as well be speaking Klingon while they’re reciting Shakespeare in Old English.

So what do you do? First off, lower your expectations. Instead of solving their problems, aim for survival! Nod empathetically while silently Googling “How to communicate with distressed humans without losing your sanity.” 

Next, keep it simple. Use short sentences and avoid big words unless you want them to think you're casting spells instead of offering support. “Breathe,” not “Let us engage in an existential exploration of our feelings.”

And remember: sometimes all they need is someone who will listen—or at least someone who won’t judge them for talking to their laptop like it's an old friend gone rogue.

In conclusion, when emotions are running high, clarity takes a vacation! So next time you find yourself in the midst of emotional chaos, just throw on some metaphorical earplugs and remember: sometimes silence speaks louder than words… especially if those words are coming from someone whose coffee cup has become an emotional volcano!

unicorn in a field of cows. The chaos of emotions hijacks the conversation, leaving clarity and connection in the dust. So how do we navigate these treacherous waters of communication in the midst of someone’s acute distress?

Maybe it’s about taking a step back and really listening. Instead of trying to fix the problem or offer advice, simply be present and validate their feelings. “I can see how upset you are about this,” you might say, acknowledging their emotions without judgment. This simple act of empathy can go a long way in calming the storm and creating a space for genuine communication to take place.

In the end, it’s not about trying to teach that cat to fetch—it’s about meeting them where they are and walking alongside them in their distress. By offering a listening ear and a compassionate heart, we can bridge the gap between chaos and understanding, creating a pathway for connection to flourish.",1,1763169296.0,ContentMarketing,0,1.0,False

I called you up for a drink

For old time’s sake

How long has it been since we last went out?

You told me you had quit drinking a while back

But we could go for a coffee

For old time’s sake

Which was strange to me

Because I used to be the one to be convinced

I offered you a cigarette like I used to

You smiled and told me you had quit a while back

But for old time’s sake you lit mine

It just doesn’t taste the same without someone to share

For old time’s sake I asked if you had plan for that weekend

You said you didn’t, that you were busy with work and with life

With a meal to cook for your pregnant wife

But for old time’s sake I could come for a dinner

For old time’s sake we bid our farewell

See you next time, for old time’s sake

Suddenly life wasn’t like it used to be

Suddenly our twenty passed so fast before our eyes

And a smoke and a drink

Our days together I had taken for granted

Suddenly, so suddenly, they became just old time’s sake",1,1763169235.0,Poems,0,1.0,False

Hello! I’m Caleb! I’ve decided that it’s about time that I put myself out there in the dating pool, so, uh...here I am. On Reddit. Not the best place, I know (hopefully better than dating apps), but I’m hoping to meet some nice folks. (perhaps you, dear reader?) I’m a quiet, introverted homebody looking for a girl to hangout and go on dates with (I believe the colloquial term for this is a “girlfriend”). I want to make it clear upfront that I’m not looking for short term flings or anything of the sort. Ideally, I’m looking for someone to be with long term, and potentially settle down with. I understand that this is a rather weighty topic to get into right in the opening paragraph, but I try to be open, honest, and communicative about things, so I just wanted to clearly state my intentions.


I am located in East Texas, near Longview, but ***I am willing to relocate for the right person. Just be in the US, please.***


If we hit it off, I’d love to move our chats to another platform so we can do voice and video calls.


[Here's what I sound like!](https://voca.ro/103aM3ke8dW0)


[Here's a picture!](https://imgur.com/a/Ubz79Db)


***Looks***:


I’m black, with olive brown skin. 5’7”, with a lean/athletic build, and just a tad shy of 140lbs. My hair is soft, black, and curly.


[Ok, these are real pictures of me this time, I swear. (I am partially shirtless in one of these, so...you’ve been warned.)](https://imgur.com/a/5wWy81c)


***Interests***:


Gaming – I mostly play singleplayer or co-op games. (I am not very competitive, and all those MOBAs and competitive shooters just seem like the epitome of stress. I don’t mind if you play them, though.) As of late, I’ve been playing a lot of Tales of Berseria, 7th Dragon 2020, and Sonic Robo Blast 2. I have pretty broad tastes in terms of genres, but if I was forced to narrow it down, I’d say I like retro games, platformers, indies, and RPGs/JRPGs. I’d love to know what sort of games you’re into, and any upcoming games you’re looking forward to!


Music – Music is quite important to me, and I’d definitely consider myself a music lover. I have pretty broad tastes, but I do have a preference for indie/alt/rock stuff. I do listen to some pop, however, along with some Japanese stuff and older R&B. I’ll give most things a try, though! (just, please no country music, I will implode) If you want an idea of what I like, check these out:

STRFKR – Rawnald Gregory Erikson the Second


Jupiter One – Countdown


Benches – Crash


Jackie Hayes – Last Second


Flawed Mangoes - Surreal


Kinoko Teikoku - 国道スロープ (Kokudou Slope)


Sorry there's so many of these! It was hard to narrow it down!


Cooking – I do a lot of cooking! Am I good at it...well, I’ll let you be the judge of that. I’m trying to branch out a bit and try different cuisines, specifically Asian cuisine as I’m rather deficient in that area. If you know any good recipes, let me know!


Art – I am slowly (heavy emphasis on slowly) teaching myself to draw. I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. It’s...certainly a process, but I’ve definitely noticed a lot of improvement. Perhaps I could draw you someday?


Misc – Well, I’m a nerd in general, really. I enjoy tinkering with tech, and I’ve been doing minor repairs on my laptops and modding my game consoles since I was a teenager. I’m also into anime and sci-fi. Also, while I wouldn’t classify this as an interest or a hobby, I do workout 3-4 times a week, mostly at home. I do enjoy endurance running though, and I typically run a 5k on the weekends (weather permitting). I also love astronomy and space!


***Potential dealbreakers?*** (one of these is a lie)


* I’m left leaning/liberal, politically 
* I don’t want kids
* I have been involved in several CIA backed attempts to overthrow legally elected leaders in foreign countries, specifically between the years of 1960 and 1985.
* I’m Christian, but not the most devout


I am looking for someone with similar values.


***What I'm Looking For***


I’m looking for the sort of relationship that allows us to be vulnerable together. I’d like someone soft (not necessarily in a physical sense, but emotionally), intelligent, and caring. I want someone to hang out with, take out for coffee dates, picnic dates, trips to museums, and binge watch shows with. I want someone that I can learn new things about for the rest of my life, someone to hold and keep safe and grow with.


As for age, I would strongly prefer someone my age or older, though I’m ok with anyone in the 20-40 range. Physically, height does not particularly matter to me (but if you’re tall I will swoon over you). I do, however, have a preference for folks on the slim/lean/toned/fit/skinny side of the body spectrum.

*I would also prefer someone outside of my own ethnicity.*


***FAQs***


\~You sound like a dork.


That’s not even a question, and how dare you. You’re correct, but how dare you.


\~In 1964, the United States was involved in a coup against Brazilian leader João Goulart, specifically providing fuel and weapons to military rebels, as well as assisting in organizing street protests against Goulart. This lead to Goulart’s overthrow and a subsequent 20-year long military dictatorship. Were you in any way, shape, or form, involved in this operation?


Uh...no comment.


\~You wouldn't happen to be interested in heinous, scandalous, devious activities such as    >!hand holding!<   ,   >! cuddling!<   , and  >!forehead kissing!<   , would you?


Why, of course not! Never!    >!(yes, absolutely)!<

For my sister — for always being the first reader of every strange idea that turned into something real.


  

They were arguing on the street. Not shouting—just unraveling. The kind of public tension people pretend not to notice while still feeling its weight.

The pavement was wet from the earlier rain. Streetlight reflections stretched long across the puddles. Cars passed slowly, as if the entire city agreed to move more carefully around them.

Respect arrived first.

She stood a few steps away, hands in her coat pockets, posture steady. She watched the couple the way one observes a distant storm—quietly, without interfering.

A man approached and came to stand beside Respect.
He walked with the deliberate certainty of someone who understood the cost of every decision. Respect handed him a coffee.

Where they stood, also stood a lamp post just next to them.

It should have lit their shoulders, but it didn’t.

The light bent around them—more around the man than Respect—but the effect was visible on both.

The light curved away from him. Not dramatically. Not in streaks or sparks. It simply avoided him, as if acknowledging his presence while refusing to claim him.

His hat sat at a slight angle—the way hats used to sit on men who never needed to pretend to be confident. He breathed like the night belonged to him.

That was Responsibility.
(Though no one said his name.)

He accepted the coffee with care, lifting it to his lips with the slow precision of someone who carried weight even in small gestures. He observed the couple with a thoughtful, measured gaze—calculating, deciding whether this was a moment that required intervention.

He was being responsible.
Respect respected that.

She never got in his way.

“Another one?” she asked, eyes drifting to the cup in his hand.

The man let out a quiet breath—more amused than irritated.

“Sorry, my love. It was too easy.”

Respect allowed herself a small smirk, then turned her attention back to the couple.

The woman spoke again.

“How are we even supposed to get baby formula now, John? Did you even think of that? No—no, because all you ever do is think of yourself.”

The words tumbled out quickly, heavy and relentless. Not sharp enough to cut—but weighted enough to bruise. She didn’t leave him space to breathe. She kept going, driven by exhaustion, fear, and the kind of pressure that only comes from loving something small and helpless.

John said nothing. His chest folded inward more with each sentence, as if her words had mass.

The more he collapsed, the more she expanded.

The man watched the imbalance with quiet intensity.
Respect watched him watching.

The woman inhaled to fire off the next sentence.

The man placed his coffee back in Respect’s hands.

He stepped forward.
Tilted his head.
Measured the moment one last time.

Then he snapped his fingers.

A single, clean sound.

Time stopped.

Traffic froze.
Pedestrians halted mid-step.
A streetlamp’s flicker paused mid-beat.
The city held its breath.

Respect stepped back.
The man stepped back.

And the woman vanished.

No dramatic flare.
No distortion.
Just a clean removal from the moment.

She reappeared somewhere else entirely.


---

The Somme, 1916

Mud thick beneath her boots. Trenches torn into the earth. Smoke hanging low, unsure which direction the wind wanted it to go.

Artillery shook the ground in slow, distant bursts—but each blast was followed by a thin, fragile sound. Something that sounded like a baby crying through closed walls.

Not a metaphor. Just how weight translated itself here.

She walked forward.

Bodies lay across the shredded earth. Every face belonged to her husband. Eyes half-open. Arms slack. Still.

None had bullet wounds.
None had been shredded by shrapnel.
Every single one had the same, precise injury:

A bayonet wound directly in the heart.

She didn’t recoil.
It made a kind of awful sense.

Living soldiers rushed past her—every single one of them wearing her face. Her expression. Her exhaustion. Her fear. Endless versions of her, moving with mechanical urgency.

A battlefield made of her actions.
A graveyard made of his consequences.

Then the charge began.

Dozens of her sprinted across the field, boots thudding in rhythm with the crying artillery. Bayonets fixed. Expressions blank. Purpose absolute.

One broke away and charged directly at her.

She didn’t run.
She didn’t fight.
She had no weapon to raise.

The bayonet entered her heart cleanly, without hesitation. The exact shape of the harm she had placed on him again and again—close, quiet, unintentional.

Her truth surfaced at the moment of impact.

“I wish I was kinder to my husband.”

Secrecy caught it instantly. Nothing escaped her. Nothing returned.

Responsibility absorbed the weight.

Then the world folded.


---

A splash of cold water struck her cheek.

She gasped—back on the street as a taxi rolled through a puddle beside her. Droplets clung to her face like remnants of another life. The city resumed its motion. A pedestrian stepped forward. Brake lights pulsed. Everything continued exactly as it had.

John stood in front of her, unchanged. From his perspective, she had never left.

The street resumed—people walking, cars passing, life continuing as if she had only flinched at a splash.

No one had noticed what happened.
No one ever does.

Because the hardest lessons are private,
and the most important corrections leave
no mark.

She didn’t speak.
She didn’t apologize.
But she understood.

For the first time in her life, she understood.

Across the street, the man took the coffee back from Respect’s hands.

He sipped it like he had all the time in the world—which in a way, he did.

Respect brushed her fingers against his arm. Not to guide him—just to let him know she was there.

“Slow down,” she murmured.

He smiled, the kind of smile that didn’t need light.

They walked away together.

Step by step.
Fading not upward or outward, but sideways—slipping into a direction the world didn’t track.

Because they were never meant to stay long.

They exist where time doesn’t.

And they are only ever here when the world becomes imbalanced.

I went into a shop like two weeks ago just to “browse” rugged phones (aka kill time before grabbing coffee).  
Next thing I know, I’m standing there messing with the **Ulefone Armor 34 Pro** like some excited kid for… I swear… a whole half hour 💀

The projector sucked me in immediately.  
I was literally projecting YouTube onto a shelf like a clown lmao.  
The staff didn’t even bother me — probably thought I was doing market research or something.

Anyway, since then this phone has been living in my brain for free.  
I told myself I’d wait for Black Friday deals next month, but I keep wondering:

**Is this thing actually as good as it felt in person?**  
Like beyond first impressions?

If you own it:

* how’s battery life in REAL daily use?
* projector heat?
* any bugs or “ugh why did they do this” moments?
* speaker clarity?
* would you buy it again?

Not picky about cameras. Just want durability + battery + something fun to mess with on breaks.

Would appreciate any honest takes before I commit my BF budget to this chunky beast 🙏",2,1763168790.0,RuggedPhones,1,1.0,False

1oxea1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1oxea1f/what_size_model_train_works_for_small_spaces/,What size model train works for small spaces?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been getting into model trains lately, and like many of you, I don't exactly have a mansion to work with. My apartment is pretty compact, and I was struggling to figure out what size model train would actually fit without taking over my entire living room.

After doing a bunch of research and talking to some hobby shop owners, I figured I'd share what I learned because I know I'm not the only one dealing with limited space.

**The Short Answer: N Scale or Z Scale**

If you're working with a small area, N scale is probably your best bet. These trains run on a 1:160 scale, which means they're small enough to create a decent layout on a table or bookshelf. You can fit a whole loop with some scenery in about 4x6 feet, which is pretty manageable.

Z scale is even tinier at 1:220, but honestly, it can be harder to work with because everything is so small. The details are tougher to see, and if you've got bigger hands like me, working on the layout can get frustrating.

**What About HO Scale?**

HO scale is the most popular size, running at 1:87. It's a great middle ground between detail and space requirements. You'll need at least 5x8 feet for a basic setup, but if you can swing it, the trains look amazing and there's tons of accessories available.

I actually started browsing different layouts and [model train sets here](https://athomewave.com/model-train) to get ideas for what would work in my space. Amazon has a huge selection, and you can compare sizes and track requirements pretty easily.

**My Recommendation**

Start with N scale if you're tight on space. You can build on a coffee table, use a fold-away board, or even mount something on the wall. The layouts are compact but still look realistic, and you won't feel like you're sacrificing your whole apartment for a hobby.

Also, think about modular layouts. These are sections you can connect and disconnect, so you can actually store them when you're not using them. Game changer for small spaces.

If you want to check out some starter options and see what might work for your setup, [this link](https://athomewave.com/model-train) takes you to a bunch of different model train options with all the specs listed. It really helped me visualize what would actually fit.

**Quick Tips:**

- Measure your space before buying anything
- Consider vertical layouts if floor space is limited
- Look for ready-to-run sets instead of building from scratch
- Join some online communities for space-saving layout ideas

Hope this helps someone else who's trying to get into the hobby without turning their bedroom into a train museum. It's totally doable with the right scale!",1,1763168746.0,ProductAmazon,0,1.0,False
