May laman din ang gcash ko, but I dont have the app on my phone. All of this is pangbayad ng bills and para sa expenses sa mga susunod na araw. 

Anong nakakuha ng attention ko lately is yung pagaasikaso sa bahay at  yung paglalaro ng mobile games.

So as a simple treat sa sarili ko, I bought my coffee on using the money na natipid ko sa allowance ko sa loob ng isang linggo na nasa bahay lang ako dahil sa walang pasok gawa ng bagyo.


Anxious sa mga susunod na buwan gawa ng mga utang na naipon pero sana magtuloy tuloy na ang recovery at matuluyan ng mawala ang urges na ito. 


Malayo pa, pero kahit papano nakahakbang na din papalayo. Nawa'y ang lahat ay maging isang panaginip na lang na babaliktanawin ko, hindi para ulitin ang pagkakamali kundi para magpatuloy at ayusin pa ang lalo para sa magandang future. Kaya kung pinanghihinaan ka din ng loob, laban lang tayo. May awa ang Diyos. Dasal at tiwala, at sana mapatawad natin ang mga sarili natin sa mga pagkakamali natin. 


Kaya natin to!

1m85hdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAVoyager/comments/1m85hdq/what_is_the_best_month_to_travel_to_oahu/,What is the best month to travel to Oahu?,"I just got back from my third trip to Oahu, and I'm convinced I've finally cracked the code on the best time to visit this Hawaiian paradise. After experiencing different seasons and talking to locals, I want to share what I've learned to help you plan your perfect trip.

September and October are hands down the best months to visit Oahu. The weather is ideal, with temperatures around 75-85¬∞F, and you'll find fewer tourists compared to peak seasons. Hotel rates drop significantly, and you can score some great deals on flights too.

During these months, the ocean is generally calmer, making it perfect for snorkeling and swimming. I spent days exploring the crystal-clear waters without dealing with the massive waves that hit the North Shore in winter months. Plus, you'll still get plenty of sunshine without the intense heat of summer.

I've visited during peak season (December-April) before, and while it's beautiful, the crowds can be overwhelming. Waikiki Beach gets packed, and you'll spend more time waiting in lines than actually enjoying attractions. Not to mention, you'll pay premium prices for everything from accommodations to activities.

Speaking of activities, if you're planning to explore the island (which you absolutely should), I recently discovered an amazing Circle Island Tour that hits all the major spots. It includes Waimea Waterfall, which was a highlight of my trip. You can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island

Some other benefits of visiting in September-October:
- Hurricane season is nearly over
- Pleasant hiking conditions (not too hot or wet)
- Better visibility for snorkeling
- Local festivals and events
- Shorter wait times at restaurants
- More availability for popular activities

If you can't make it during these months, April-May is your next best option. You'll still get decent weather and moderate crowds, though prices might be slightly higher.

What to avoid? July and August are extremely hot and crowded with summer travelers. December through March sees the highest rainfall and biggest waves, plus premium holiday pricing.

A pro tip I learned: book your activities in advance, especially during shoulder season. While there are fewer tourists, popular tours still fill up quickly. This ensures you don't miss out on must-see attractions like Diamond Head or the North Shore.

Remember, there's really no ""bad"" time to visit Oahu ‚Äì it's paradise year-round. But if you're looking to maximize your experience while minimizing costs and crowds, September-October is your sweet spot.

From personal experience, these months offer the perfect balance of great weather, reasonable prices, and manageable crowds. You can actually enjoy your morning coffee on a peaceful beach without fighting for space!

Let me know if you have any specific questions about planning your trip. I'm always happy to share more detailed insights about particular areas or activities on the island.",1,1753366301.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

While the **Dow Jones is down over 250 points**, the **NASDAQ is climbing** steadily on the back of strong performances from tech giants. It‚Äôs a tale of two markets ‚Äî broad weakness across sectors, yet pockets of explosive strength if you know where to look.

# üîç What We‚Äôre Seeing

* **Tech stocks are leading the charge**, with standouts like $GOOG, $META, and $NVDA pushing the NASDAQ higher.
* The **S&P 500 is holding flat**, carried by a few large-cap winners but weighed down by cyclicals and defensives.
* Meanwhile, the **Russell 2000 and Dow Jones are showing notable weakness**, highlighting small-cap and industrial pressure.
* **Market internals** tell the real story: over 60% of stocks are declining, but over 90% of *new highs* are coming from a small cluster of runners, primarily in **semiconductors and AI infrastructure**.

# ‚öôÔ∏è What This Means for Traders

Today is not a ‚Äúbuy anything‚Äù market ‚Äî it's a **stock picker's day**.

üîπ **Momentum chasers** are flocking to tech. If you‚Äôve been riding the AI/semiconductor wave, it‚Äôs paying off.  
üîπ **Swing traders** should focus on names that held up well during recent weakness ‚Äî think high ROIC, high-margin, low-debt growth stocks in tech.  
üîπ **Day traders**, your best setups will come from **volume anomalies and relative strength**, especially in names hitting new highs while the indexes chop.

# üîî What I‚Äôm Watching

I‚Äôm shifting today‚Äôs strategy to:

* Ride relative strength in tech
* Avoid overexposed small caps unless there‚Äôs unusual volume or a clear catalyst
* Prepare for a potential Friday fade unless the S&P confirms a breakout

# üß© Final Thought

This is one of those days where **the surface looks weak**, but **underneath there's a quiet rally in selective, high-conviction sectors**. The bears might have control on paper, but the bulls are sneaking wins where it matters ‚Äî and if you know how to read between the red, there‚Äôs opportunity.

1m85e4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamemusic/comments/1m85e4m/indie_games_with_such_appropriate_soundtracks/,Indie games with such appropriate soundtracks that they feel like they tie the whole thing together -- which ones do you feel deserve a mention?,"There are great tracks that make you instantly recall that specific game ‚Äì one that comes to me immediately, on a completely personal level, is the [Dalmasca Estersand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOdusIM3Gok) (composed by Hitoshi Sakamoto, along with all the other tracks). That sweeping desert feel of the first zone is unforgettable and that song is what I hear in my head when I think of it. It‚Äôs just extremely well done zone-specifically, so much so that it‚Äôs the one I mention here, though the WHOLE soundtrack is a 10/10 as accompaniment to the rest of the game. Some tracks get a bit repetitive when you‚Äôre grinding of course, but more‚Äôs the enjoyment in some cases!¬†

Then, I think, there are those that feel less like accompaniment and more like the auditive glue that binds everything together and kind of focuses it. Purely a subjective notion/distinction on my part, but it is what it is. So here‚Äôs a little letter of love and appreciation for some (indie) games where their tracks feel like they carry a really big part of the whole experience.

* [Disco Elysium](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632470/Disco_Elysium__The_Final_Cut/) **|** Haunting jazz rock, melancholy ambient tones, and DISCO‚Ä¶ sad, sad, bygone DISCO! The feeling is that of drinking coffee in a crumbling city where you don‚Äôt remember your name, feeling philosophical despair and confusion all the while
* [Warfactory](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3396160/Warfactory/) (Unreleased) **|** A kind of mechanical ambient techno with glitchy AI tones, perfect for a base building game of this kind. Played the playtest for this recently and the beats almost feel like they sync with your industrial 4X expansion. It‚Äôs chunky, and it hits you right in the esophagus. I think their trailer also has it
* [Hyper Light Drifter](https://store.steampowered.com/app/257850/Hyper_Light_Drifter/) **|**¬†Ethereal sounding synth, it just oozes a kind of mysterious note that permeates the whole of the gameplay. Nothing else would be as fitting here, honestly
* [Oxenfree](https://store.steampowered.com/app/388880/Oxenfree/) **|** Some eerie synths and occassional static sounds, it builds tension in all the right ways and fits the ghosty vibe of the game unbelievably well and also distinguishes it from the ambience that Silent Hill inculcated people to
* [Journey ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/638230/Journey/)**|** Last but not least, it's got the best orchestral sound I heard in an indie game, probably. It carries that subtle spiritual theme and just feels graceful and floaty.

In the fourth year of her marriage to Atticus Peterson, Wynter Montgomery discovered she was pregnant.

She went to the hospital to register for prenatal care, but when the nurse checked her documents, she was told her marriage certificate was invalid.

Wynter froze. ""That's impossible.""

The nurse pointed at the seal. ""This stamp is irregular, and the registration number doesn‚Äôt match our records.""

Refusing to believe it, Wynter rushed to the county clerk‚Äôs office‚Äîonly to hear the same verdict.

""Mr. Peterson is already married. His legal spouse is listed as Luciana Montgomery...""

Luciana?

The name hit Wynter like a thunderbolt, leaving her mind reeling.

Luciana‚Äîher half-sister, and Atticus‚Äôs first love.

Years ago, Luciana had left Atticus at the altar, fleeing abroad to chase her dreams.

Yet now, she was legally his wife?

......

Wynter stumbled out of the office like a ghost, her vision swimming, her steps unsteady.

Only when she collapsed into the backseat of a waiting cab did the tears she‚Äôd been holding back finally spill over in silence.

Four years ago, she had married Atticus in Luciana‚Äôs place to spare both families the scandal.

At first, Atticus had been distant, cold.

But Wynter never complained. She cared for his every need with unwavering devotion.

Gradually, day by day, he began to let his guard down.

He allowed her to disrupt his rigid routines.

Listened to her silly jokes with a patient smile.

Even trusted her with confidential work files.

Eventually, Atticus softened toward her.

He gave her a black card with unlimited spending, took her to every Michelin-starred restaurant in the city.

Once, when she craved peanut brittle from a bakery across town in the dead of night, he drove there himself, returning with an exasperated chuckle. ""You‚Äôre impossible,"" he teased, pinching her cheek. ""My little glutton.""

Wynter had thought she‚Äôd finally won his heart.

Then, two months ago, Luciana returned‚Äîterminally ill with cancer.

That same night, her father, Raymond Montgomery, called a family meeting.

His voice was grave as he addressed Wynter. ""Your sister has six months left at most. Her greatest regret is never marrying Atticus. So, you‚Äôll step aside‚Äîtemporarily. Once the wedding is over, and after she‚Äôs gone, Atticus will still be yours.""

Her stepmother, Carmen, pleaded through tears. ""She‚Äôs your sister. Just bear with it this once!""

Luciana sobbed hysterically. ""It‚Äôs my dying wish. Please, let me have this.""

Wynter couldn‚Äôt believe what she was hearing.

Her eyes burned as she choked out her reply. ""You forced me into this marriage like a puppet. Now you want to hand Atticus to her? What am I to you? I refuse!""

Her father ignored her protests, locking her in her room until she ""came to her senses.""

On the third day, she heard Atticus had smashed a coffee cup in front of Raymond in fury.

By the thirteenth, headlines blared Atticus‚Äôs public declaration: ""There is only one Mrs. Peterson‚ÄîWynter Montgomery.""

On the twenty-eighth, Atticus froze all business dealings with the Montgomery family, demanding they return his wife.

A full month passed before her locked door finally opened.

Chapter 2 - A Heart Shattered by Lies
But in the next second, she heard his hoarse voice say, ""Wynter, I'm sorry.""

""Your parents were insistent‚Äîthey even got down on their knees to beg me. For the sake of our families' long-standing friendship, I had to go along with your sister's act.""

""But trust me, it's just for show. You'll always be my only wife.""

At that moment, Wynter felt her heart plunge into darkness, every breath laced with searing pain.

After a stunned pause, she gently touched Atticus's hollow cheek, swallowing her tears. ""You did what you had to do.""

Later, she watched helplessly as Atticus slid a diamond ring onto Luciana's finger in front of a crowd, giving her a lavish wedding.

Later, he still treated her with the same attention as before.

Except the time he spent with Luciana grew longer‚Äîfrom occasional visits to nights stretching into days.

When Wynter confronted him, he calmly explained, ""I don‚Äôt love her. I just want to be there for her during her final days.""

Wynter believed him.

Until the truth hit her like a slap.

......

By the time the car stopped outside Peterson Corporation, Wynter had steadied herself.

She clutched the fake marriage certificate tightly in her hand.

Upon reaching the top floor, she ran into Atticus's secretary.

The secretary's expression tightened at the sight of her.

""Mrs. Peterson, what brings you here?""

""I need to see Atticus.""

""He's in a meeting right now. He can't‚Äî""

Ignoring the secretary, Wynter marched to his office door.

Just as she was about to push it open, Luciana's voice drifted out.

""Atticus, look me in the eyes and tell me the truth."" Luciana tugged at his tie with one hand, pressing the other over his heart. ""Has this ever really let me go?""

Atticus's throat moved, his breath hitching at her touch, yet his voice was cold. ""You're delusional.""

""Am I?"" Luciana laughed softly. ""You only married Wynter to force me to come back, didn‚Äôt you? The moment I returned, you made it official with me.""

""And then there‚Äôs your diary.""

""You said you let Wynter take my place to make me regret leaving‚Äîmmph!""

Before she could finish, Atticus grabbed the back of her neck.

All words were swallowed by a kiss that was almost brutal.

His eyes burned as he growled through clenched teeth, ""Yes. I never let you go. So, Luciana, how are you going to make it up to me?""

Wynter stood frozen outside, her body numb as if submerged in ice.

She remembered how Atticus had held her just days ago, kissing her hair as he whispered, ""Wynter, your sister is in the past. You're the only one I love now.""

How pathetic.

His so-called devotion had been nothing but lies.

Their marriage had been a farce from the start.

Wynter closed her eyes, forcing back tears.

If this was Atticus's choice, then she would let him go‚Äîlet him be with the woman he truly loved.

Dazed, Wynter stumbled into the elevator.

By the time she regained her senses, it had stopped at the basement level.

A cheerful intern approached her. ""Are you here for Luciana Montgomery's art exhibit? This way.""

Only then did Wynter realize she hadn‚Äôt pressed a floor.

Mechanically, she followed the intern into the gallery.

Chapter 3 - The Scar That Tore Her Heart
Wynter's gaze lingered on one of the oil paintings.

The canvas depicted a man's bare back, muscles sharply defined, with a distinctive scar near the lower back‚Äîunmistakable to her.

She had traced that scar's outline countless times in the dark. She knew exactly whose back this was.

Luciana had painted numerous portraits of Atticus, each signed with dates that seared Wynter's vision.

June 20th‚ÄîAtticus stood in the kitchen, bathed in golden light, stirring a pot.

Her third day of confinement. She'd been starving herself in protest, stomach cramping until she blacked out, while he cooked soup for Luciana.

July 1st‚ÄîElegant hands folded a silk nightgown embroidered with irises, his wedding band glinting coldly.

Day thirteen. She'd slit her wrists in defiance, blood soaking half the bedsheet, while he meticulously arranged Luciana's wardrobe.

July 15th‚ÄîHe walked beneath a canopy of trees, umbrella in hand, the painting's edge hinting at interlaced fingers.

Day twenty-eight. Her father had chained her to the bed, forcing surrender, while she writhed in feverish sheets. Meanwhile, he strolled through morning light, hand-in-hand with Luciana.

Each painting drove a needle deeper into Wynter's heart.

That entire month of darkness‚Äîhe hadn't been fighting for her at all. He'd been with Luciana the whole time.

His grand gestures‚Äîshattering china before her father, public declarations, cutting ties with the Montgomerys‚Äîall smoke and mirrors.

Wynter's nails bit into her palms, yet she felt nothing.

She turned away abruptly, exiting the exhibition.

---

Wynter scheduled an abortion for the following week, then visited the family estate to collect her late mother's belongings.

Her father met her with a plane ticket.

""Carmen and I agreed. Luciana should spend her remaining time with Atticus.""

""Leave in ten days. Consider it a vacation.""

Wynter studied the ticket, lips pressed thin.

The message was clear: they wanted her gone so Atticus and Luciana could play house undisturbed.

""Wynter, don't misunderstand‚Äî"" Carmen's eyes were red-rimmed, her worn-out excuses grating.

""I'll go.""

She was done with Atticus.

Done with this family.

Her father blinked at her compliance, mistaking it for defeat. His voice softened.

""Luciana's farewell gathering is in three days. Be there.""

""Fine.""

---

Home again, Wynter hauled out a cardboard box, purging every remnant of Atticus.

The birthday mugs.

Their first movie tickets.

The ridiculous photo booth strips she'd begged him to take.

The front door clicked open as she sealed the box.

Atticus froze at the sight, his chest constricting. He strode forward.

Chapter 4 - A Heart No Longer Begging
Wynter kept her head bowed, her gaze fixed on the floor.""Luciana‚Äôs moving in soon, right? I‚Äôm just clearing my things so she won‚Äôt be bothered by them.""Atticus seized her wrist, pulling her roughly against him.",1,1753365956.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

While using it over the past few weeks, I‚Äôve found many reasons to like it, but a few quirks stood out as well. It‚Äôs not every day you come across a machine that blends affordability with effective brewing so well, but the Keurig K-Express seems to manage just that. Let‚Äôs dive into the details.  

**Sleek Design and Compact Build**  
The first thing that caught my eye was its compact and modern look. The Keurig K-Express is understated yet stylish, fitting effortlessly on my kitchen counter without hogging too much space. Measuring around 15 inches in both height and depth and just 7 inches wide, this brewer is perfect for small kitchens or offices where space is limited. I loved how it didn‚Äôt clash with my other kitchen appliances, thanks to its versatile black finish.

**Easy to Operate with Intuitive Features**  
This single-serve coffee maker was shockingly simple to operate. It features easy-to-use buttons for brewing coffee without the hassle. The inclusion of a ‚ÄúStrong‚Äù button added a pleasant surprise. I get to amplify the boldness of my morning cup of coffee with the push of a button. Whether you‚Äôre rushing off to work or enjoying a laid-back Sunday, it delivers coffee quickly, fresh, and hot every time.  

[Find the best price for Keurig K-Express on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b09715g57m/)

**Multiple Brewing Options and Reservoir Convenience**  
The flexibility to pick between 8, 10, and 12 oz. brew sizes came in handy since I tend to vary my coffee quantities. Hosting a visitor who likes bigger servings? No problem; the machine handles it like a pro. Additionally, the 42oz removable reservoir was a standout feature‚Äîit allowed me to make several cups before refilling. Personally, I was brewing 4 cups with ease before topping it up. Convenience truly feels like the cornerstone of its design.  

**Helpful Energy-Saving Features**  
One small but noteworthy aspect is the machine‚Äôs energy efficiency. There‚Äôs an automatic shut-off feature that powers the unit down five minutes after the last brew. Not only does this minimize my electricity usage, but it‚Äôs also fantastic for those mornings when I rush out of the house and forget to turn things off.  

**Travel Mug Compatibility for On-the-Go Lifestyles**  
As someone who frequently takes coffee on the go, I appreciated that it accommodates travel mugs up to 7.4 inches tall by simply removing the drip tray. It‚Äôs these thoughtful details that show Keurig understands practical needs in daily coffee routines.  

**Advantages**  
- Compact and modern design suits small spaces.  
- ‚ÄúStrong‚Äù button for intensified coffee flavor.  
- Straightforward button interface, ideal for busy individuals.  
- The 42oz water reservoir reduces the need for frequent refills.
- Travel mug-friendly for those always on the move.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The machine can be a bit loud while brewing, especially early in the morning.
- K-Cup pods can become an environmental concern because they aren‚Äôt widely recyclable.  
- The water reservoir, while convenient, isn‚Äôt transparent, making it tricky to guess the remaining water level without opening it.  

**Competing Products**  
Taking a step back to see what else is out there, the K-Express is often compared to other single-serve brewers like the Nespresso Vertuo and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. Compared to Nespresso, this model doesn‚Äôt quite match the barista-quality richness for espresso lovers. However, it‚Äôs much more affordable and versatile since it can accommodate standard K-Cups as well as ground coffee (with the reusable My K-Cup, sold separately).  

On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew offers a similar removable reservoir but lacks the sleek aesthetics of the Keurig K-Express. It‚Äôs also a tad less efficient when it comes to speed and consistency. Ultimately, where the Keurig wins is its balance of aesthetics, speed, and ease of use.  

**Price Performance**  
Evaluating its price against its features, I‚Äôd say it offers solid bang for the buck. It‚Äôs difficult to find a coffee maker at this price point with such a modern design and handy features like the ‚ÄúStrong‚Äù button. You also get an energy-efficient, beginner-friendly machine capable of quick, fresh brews without splurging on unnecessary bells and whistles.

the second post in my ""Coffee Deep Dive"" series focuses around Coffee Trade and Logistics. There will be a second part of this post coming over the weekend which will dive a bit deeper on the ""quirky"" stories around international coffee trade.

**Coffee is grown in over 70 countries, but production is concentrated in a few key regions.**¬†In 2024/25, world production was about¬†**174 million 60-kg bags**. South America (led by Brazil, the largest producer) accounts for the biggest share, while Asia (led by Vietnam) and Africa are also major contributors. Production can swing with weather and plant cycles - for example, Brazil‚Äôs biennial yield patterns caused a nearly 8% output jump that year. On the demand side,¬†**global consumption**¬†has been gradually rising, roughly matching supply around¬†**170 million bags**¬†annually. Notably, 2022/23 saw a slight¬†**2% dip in consumption to 173.1 million bags**¬†as economic pressures (inflation, lower incomes) tempered coffee drinking. Despite this blip, coffee‚Äôs popularity endures: the International Coffee Organization forecasts consumption to recover as global growth continues.

The global coffee market size was estimated at¬†**USD 269 billion in 2024**. Traditional markets in Europe and North America still drink the most, but¬†**new consumption trends**¬†are emerging.¬†**Specialty coffee**¬†is on the rise - urban youth and global middle classes are developing a taste for premium brews, driving growth in Asia and beyond.

1m850dp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m850dp,Now I know why Starbucks is going downhill.,"I haven‚Äôt been to Starbucks in a long time, but what I do remember of it was plush seating and plenty of tables to work or sit and read at.

I‚Äôve also been reading about all the enhancements they‚Äôve been making in the stores to try to turn the brand around. 

I was visiting New York for a week and these are the photos of the Starbucks I ran into. All looked pretty much the same. Hardly any seating. What seating there was was usually around the window area and very uncomfortable and not in any way a ‚Äúplace away from home.‚Äù Felt more like a get your coffee and get the F out place. 

The condiment bar that I keep reading about most of the time sits on a trashcan, and nothing like what it used to be. No cinnamon or chocolate powders or anything like before, not even syrup like there used to be. Just a bunch of holders  hastily packed with various sugars. A couple of sorry-looking pitchers. 

And finally, baristas were hit and miss. You can‚Äôt tell if they love or hate their jobs. Nothing like the cult of energy that the place used to have. 

I live in Thailand for part of the year and the Starbucks over there completely cream the ones here. Beautiful and plenty of leather sofas and fabric chairs. Three storeys of these. They bring your coffee right to your table. The entire place is warm and big and inviting and decor. Miles apart from the garbage worn down looking ones you have here.

1m850dl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m850dl/does_the_county_line_kitchen_cold_brew_coffee/,Does the County Line Kitchen Cold Brew Coffee Maker Offer Exceptional Value Review?,"The County Line Kitchen B07VJJJ764 Glass Cold Brew Coffee Maker has become an integral part of my morning routine, especially during these sweltering summer days when nothing beats the refreshing kick of a cold brew. With its thoughtfully designed features and durable build, this coffee maker promises to make your favorite iced coffee or tea effortlessly. After using it for several weeks, I want to share my experience in detail, covering the highs and where there's room for improvement.

**Build Quality and Design**

This product feels like it‚Äôs made to endure rough handling. The mason jar design is not only visually appealing but also extremely sturdy. Crafted from high-quality, BPA-free glass, the coffee maker doesn‚Äôt retain any odors or flavors from previous brews, which is great for those who like to switch between coffee and tea. The attached handle is incredibly convenient for carrying it around the house or even to the office. While the device is sleek and stylish, it‚Äôs also subtly rustic, making it a charming addition to any kitchen.

**Ease of Use**

One of the strongest aspects of this product is how simple it is to operate. I‚Äôve always been a fan of kitchen gadgets that don‚Äôt involve rocket science, and this cold brew maker fits the bill perfectly. It‚Äôs as easy as filling the stainless steel mesh filter with your coffee grounds, adding cold water, sealing the lid, and waiting for the magic of steeping to happen. Cleaning the device is just as hassle-free since the components are dishwasher safe. This ease of use really sets it apart from more complex cold brew devices.

[Check County Line Kitchen B07VJJJ764 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07vjjj764/)

**Performance and Brewing Experience**

During my testing, the cold brew consistently turned out smooth and bold. The stainless steel mesh filter does an outstanding job of keeping the coffee grounds out of your beverage, ensuring a clean and grit-free drink every single time. I tried a dark roast, a medium roast, and even a mixture of loose-leaf tea; all delivered excellent results. One thing worth mentioning is the precision-engineered leak-proof lid that keeps everything secure. Whether I was storing it in the fridge or carrying it to my garden for an alfresco coffee session, there were no leaks or spills.

**Advantages**

- The stainless steel filter effectively prevents coffee grounds from leaking into the drink.  
- Handles and the flip-spout lid make pouring effortless without any awkward accidents.  
- High-quality, BPA-free glass construction ensures no flavors or chemicals leach into the coffee.  

**Critiques**

While I mostly loved using this coffee maker, a couple of issues caught my attention:  

- The glass jar, while durable, is a bit heavy when filled to capacity, making it slightly cumbersome to handle for some.  
- The filter may be too narrow for those who prefer coarsely ground coffee, as it seems optimized for finer grinds.  

**Competing Products**

Having also tested other cold brew coffee makers, like the Takeya Cold Brew Coffee Maker and the OXO Good Grips Cold Brew Coffee Maker, I found that the County Line Kitchen model shines due to its simplicity and leak-proof lid. The Takeya, though lighter in weight, doesn‚Äôt feel as sturdy, and its plastic design lacks the aesthetic appeal of a mason jar. The OXO model, while offering slightly better filtration, operates with more components, making it a hassle to clean and assemble. For someone like me who prioritizes ease of use, the County Line Kitchen cold brew maker strikes the right balance of functionality and charm.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

Investing in this glass cold brew coffee maker feels like a smart choice. While it might not be the cheapest option out there, the quality, sturdiness, and user-friendly features make it worth spending a little extra. This product could easily save coffee enthusiasts a significant amount of money in the long run by allowing them to ditch expensive coffee shop visits for a homemade brew.

1m84xat,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/1m84xat/my_subclinical_hypothyroidism_was_helped_by/,"My Subclinical Hypothyroidism Was Helped by Iodine, Vitamin A, and Timing Habits (With Studies)","For the past few years, I've been treating subclinical hypothyroidism, which is the type of thyroid condition where TSH gradually increases but is still referred to as ""borderline"" by most medical professionals. I'm sharing my experience as a n=1 case that might resonate with someone looking into the underlying causes, rather than as medical advice.

Two things stood out after I conducted my own research and had lab work done (including Free T3, T4, antibodies, and micronutrient levels): my iodine and vitamin A levels were low-normal, and my symptoms were typical: thinning hair, fatigue, dry skin, slow digestion, and cold hands.

That prompted me to start my research, and this is what I discovered that revolutionised my approach.

üß¨ Iodine and Vitamin A: A Complementary Pair?

Iodine is crucial for the synthesis of T3 and T4, which is why we frequently hear about its use alone in the production of thyroid hormones. However, I was unaware that the body needs vitamin A in order to use iodine correctly.

üß† In a 2007 randomised study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, vitamin A supplementation enhanced iodine's ability to lower TSH levels in kids with mild deficiencies. (Zimmermann and others, 2007)

This study clarified for me why iodine might not be sufficient on its own, particularly in areas where mild vitamin A deficiency is prevalent.

‚úÖ My Experiences :

I started taking a liquid supplement in spray form with measured microdoses after talking with my doctor about it:  
  
150 mcg of iodine  
  
900 mcg of vitamin A (retinol)  
  
Two tongue sprays per day for three months, with a one-month interval in between  
  
This format made dosing consistent and helped avoid pills. My TSH decreased a little, and more significantly, my energy and digestion improved. My bloodwork and symptoms also improved.

‚òï Minor Routine Adjustments That Assist in Quitting Coffee First Thing in the Morning  
Cortisol, which is naturally elevated after waking, is increased by caffeine. Early caffeine use can exacerbate the stress response, especially in women, according to studies. (Lovallo and others, 2005)  
  
I began my day with some exercise and sunshine, then had a breakfast high in fat and protein, followed by coffee one to two hours later.  
  
Reduce seed oils and concentrate on cooked root vegetables, avocado, fatty fish, and whole eggs.

Conclusion  
This is definitely not for everyone, and I'm not saying it's a cure. However, before deciding on a course of treatment, it might be worthwhile to check your iodine and vitamin A status (ideally through blood and urine tests) if, like me, you're stuck in the grey area of thyroid function.  
  
I'd be interested in knowing if anyone else has researched this or if you've discovered any other nutrients that work in tandem with thyroid function. All discussions are welcome!

I recently got my hands on the Braun KF7150BK BrewSense 12-Cup Drip Coffee Maker, and I‚Äôve got to say, it‚Äôs been a morning game-changer in my household. Let‚Äôs start with the aesthetic appeal‚Äîthis machine is sleek. Sporting a stainless steel and black finish, its modern design easily elevates the look of any kitchen counter without feeling bulky thanks to its compact footprint. I‚Äôve owned some clunky coffee makers in the past, and this one feels like a step into sophistication.  

Beyond its looks, the coffee maker is all about functionality. Its Pure Flavor brewing system is impressive; it brews at the optimal temperature and timing for a cup of coffee that genuinely tastes fresh every single morning. I appreciate that this machine pays attention to flavor extraction‚Äîit‚Äôs like finally having that caf√©-style coffee at home without the ongoing costs. My spouse is particular about their coffee, and they claim they‚Äôve tasted small but noticeable improvements in the flavor compared to our older model. 

**Performance: Smooth and User-Friendly**  

Running the KF7150BK couldn‚Äôt be easier. First, the intuitive button controls on the front panel make navigation an absolute breeze. I‚Äôm definitely not the most tech-savvy individual, but setting up the machine or using the auto-brew feature was a straightforward and frustration-free process. The machine even has a digital LCD display that feels almost like a ‚Äúvisual guide‚Äù when brewing.  

The reusable gold-tone filter is one feature I now swear by. Unlike disposable paper filters, it doesn‚Äôt absorb any of the coffee‚Äôs essential oils, so you get bolder, richer flavors in each brew. Plus, it feels great not to constantly toss paper filters away; definitely a win for the eco-conscious. Let‚Äôs also talk about the auto-shutoff feature‚Äîit saved me from some potential disasters on my forgetful mornings.

**Merits of the Braun BrewSense**  

- Its compact size fits snugly into smaller kitchen spaces without compromising capacity (up to 12 cups!).  
- The coffee maker‚Äôs anti-drip system allows for interruption-free mid-pour moments. Forget waking up late and waiting for the full pot‚Äîyou can grab a quick cup in seconds.  
- Maintenance is thoughtfully considered; the cleaning cycle can be customized to match water hardness in different regions.  
- Parts like the carafe and filter basket are dishwasher-safe, so cleanup remains relatively hassle-free.  

**Areas of Concern for Improvement**  

- The carafe‚Äôs pouring spout could use some improvement. Occasionally, I notice a little spillage if I‚Äôm not careful with the pouring angle.  
- While the Pure Flavor system enhances the coffee flavor, it does take over eight minutes to brew a full pot‚Äînot ideal for people often in a morning rush.  

**How Does It Hold Up Against Product Rivals?**  

In comparison with other premium drip coffee makers like the Cuisinart PerfectTemp and Technivorm Moccamaster, the Braun BrewSense distinguishes itself by combining affordability and high-end features. The PerfectTemp excels in keeping coffee hot for long periods, while the Moccamaster wins for its specialty brewing capabilities. However, neither competitor matched Braun‚Äôs focus on intuitive usability and compact design in my experience. That anti-drip pause-and-pour system alone, coupled with the Pure Flavor technology, makes it a strong contender.  

However, the slower brewing time could deter those already drawn to the Moccamaster's speed. For smaller households or solo coffee drinkers, I‚Äôd also recommend considering single-serve coffee machines like the Keurig K-Elite, which might be faster and more tailored to smaller quantities.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  

This coffee maker falls into what I‚Äôd call the ‚Äúgoldilocks zone‚Äù of pricing: not too cheap to feel flimsy, yet not exorbitantly priced like some high-end competitors. For the well-thought-out features, durability, and solid brewing performance, I think it‚Äôs a smart purchase that won‚Äôt break the bank. However, it feels more tailored to casual coffee drinkers than espresso obsessives, which is worth considering depending on your preferences.

1m84wp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MovingToLosAngeles/comments/1m84wp6/what_neighborhood_to_live_in/,What Neighborhood to Live In?,"Hi everyone, my husband and I (29M and 28M) will be moving to Los Angeles from the Chicago suburbs within the next 2 months. I have a job offer with a tentative start date of 10/1/25. Our ultimate goal is to move further south into OC or San Diego as we like the laid back kind of lifestyle, but moving from out of state, LA had the most job opportunities.

My main question is what neighborhood we should live in. I am pretty introverted but my husband is very social, but it doesn't need to be right outside our door. We own a townhouse in the downtown area of the city we live in, so it's quiet but we can walk to a lot of restaurants and coffee places by us. My job is in the Beverly Grove area and I will be on-site 5 days a week. My husband does not have a job yet, but is finishing up a masters program at Northwestern University at the end of August, so fingers crossed he can find something soon. Right now I am looking at a complex on the edge of Koreatown. It's a little more city than we're used to, but it's on the edge of the area, and from street view, seems like it's a good spot for us. We were also looking at the Studio City and Culver City areas, but Culver City seems a little out of our price range. We are hoping to start in a 1 bedroom for 2600 or less (not including utilities), and eventually move to a 2 bedroom when we are more secure in where we want to live. 

Anyway, this is very long-winded, but I need help. We've both only ever lived in Illinois (including central Illinois, Chicago suburbs and Chicago proper). I know all about where to live here in Chicago, but LA is completely new to us, other than vacationing and visiting friends. Help out with recommendations on where to live, different complexes, etc. We have 2 dogs, want a pool, parking, balcony.

Any help is appreciated. Thank you!",2,1753364895.0,MovingToLosAngeles,4,1.0,False

1m84wd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingAids/comments/1m84wd3/trialing_the_i90_sphere_infinio_some_thoughts/,Trialing the i-90 Sphere Infinio -- some thoughts,"So, it's been about a week and a bit of testing out these hearing aids. I have some thoughts, and almost unanimously positive. For clarity, I have been profoundly deaf (binaurally) since I was around 18-22 months old. I am now 42. I have no discernable speech impediment, and my hearing loss is not considered progressive.

First off, I think the Sphere Infinio is the biggest technological & software leap for hearing aids in a generation. I'm not sure why this isn't being marketed as much, but I cannot every remember such a massive leap in control and ease of hearing in my lifetime. Not even the step from analog to digital. This is a major advancement.

I will give you a few anecdotes to highlight just how incredible the Sphere feature is.

* While out with my wife and friends on Friday night, we went to a very busy spot in Toronto. We decided to sit outside so I could test out the Sphere. While using the feature, I explained how I'm trialing these hearing aids and explained how the hearing aids worked. While going into the story about these hearing aids, they had a weird look on their faces and then my wife asked me, ""Why are you whispering?"" I thought I was yelling. The Sphere feature is so good, it made the surrounding ambience feel like it was a quiet room. I could hear everyone talking and I felt comfortable with it -- even if the sound wasn't 'natural'. 

* During a work conversation with my director, I turned the Sphere on while walking to a coffee shop. Our conversation flowed easily and I was able to hear him quite clearly despite the traffic and din.

* While walking with my five year old to school, we were able to have a conversation. Of course, it was just about hot wheels and poop, but I think he was happy that I was conversing with him as we walked. It was nice to be able to do this with him -- at the very least, just getting him in a good mood before school.

I think an important detail here is that the effort and strain to hear people I am talking to is much much lower. I have felt some level of relief because of it. I didn't feel exhausted or tired within minutes of any of those conversations. In fact, our friends have told my wife that they have never seen me this engaged before -- they know I struggle with these noisy environments, but the conversations of six people for three hours didn't impede my ability to participate. 

In addition, I'm hearing noises I couldn't hear before. Specifically the shhh and chhh sounds. I could not hear these sounds before. I can hear the beeps and noises from various appliances, such as the dishwasher, microwave, oven, my laptop, etc. I can hear the clicks of the turn signal in my car, which was NOT noticeable or audible to me before.

Obviously there are some downsides, such as the automatic mode. I generally prefer music mode because it gives me near full directionality I don't get with automatic. But these hearing aids, even when not in Sphere mode, are absolutely fantastic. I cannot believe the jump up from the P50s.",2,1753364872.0,HearingAids,0,1.0,False

We‚Äôre launching a new AI assistant for email scheduling on Product Hunt next week - and we‚Äôre giving early access to the premium version for free.

If you‚Äôre in your final year, about to graduate, or just starting your job search, this might be a huge help.

It‚Äôs called **Meet-Ting** (or Ting for short), and it‚Äôs a super simple AI tool that helps you book and manage meetings. It connects to your calendar and preferences, and you just CC it into emails and it handles the scheduling for you. Importantly though, it's only available for Gmail right now.

Why it‚Äôs useful:

* Makes it easy to book coffee chats, interviews, and networking calls
* Helps you look professional and responsive (without the back-and-forth)
* Saves time when you‚Äôre applying for jobs, meeting with mentors, or building your personal brand

If you‚Äôre trying to break into your first role, this kind of polish can go a long way.

Personality tests tell me I‚Äôm slightly introverted. Emphasis on slightly. But I don‚Äôt buy the binary of introvert vs. extrovert.

I think most of us live somewhere on a sliding scale, and where we fall depends on the day, the people we‚Äôre with, and whether or not we‚Äôve had coffee/adult beverages.

Yes, I can work a room at a conference (and even enjoy it). Yes, I also get totally drained after and need a break from humanity. Both can be true.

Sometimes I‚Äôm the guy pulling people into a group dinner. Sometimes I‚Äôm the one sneaking out early to order room service and watch Seinfeld in peace.

And you know what? That‚Äôs not confusion, that‚Äôs context.

We‚Äôre complex creatures. We evolve. We respond to our environments. And we should give ourselves (and others) the space to flex across the spectrum without slapping on labels.

So the next time someone asks if you're an introvert or extrovert, feel free to say: ""Depends who's asking.""

Curious‚Äîwhere do you fall on the spectrum today?

Nespresso often runs parallel promotions for both Original and Vertuo lines. Many (not all) of the promo codes are formatted as such: [WORD][YY] for Original, or [WORD][YYYY] for Vertuo. If you receive a marketing e-mail with a promo code of LATTE18 that requires the purchase of Original sleeves, you may be able to change the code to LATTE2018 and it will apply to the purchase of Vertuo sleeves instead. This also comes into play if the code uses the word COFFEE or ESPRESSO, these are generally interchangeable for both lines. It is also common for Original line deals to require more sleeves to be purchased- for example 25 vs 20 sleeves for the Vertuo line code.

**New Customers**

Nespresso typically defines a new customer as someone who has placed fewer than 3 orders. You may need to place one order before you qualify for new customer promotions, such as the welcome gifts. If you are an existing customer with more than 3 orders on record, you can create a new account to take advantage of new customer promotions and coupon codes.

**NOTE:** Not all limited-time promotions are available to all customers. If a code is not expired but does not work for you, it may be a targeted promotion.",2,1753364282.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False

1m84jn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1m84jn2/does_bogda_water_filter_bo0223_deliver_on/,Does BOGDA Water Filter BO022-3 Deliver on Advanced Filtration Claims? A Thorough Review,"**Design and Build Quality**

The BOGDA BO022-3 water filter immediately makes an impression with its sleek and compact design. Its dimensions, sized at 2.5 inches by 6 inches by 8 inches, ensure that it fits right into most fridge models without causing any space issues. I tested it on a Frigi-Daire model, and the fit was absolutely perfect. The finishing on this filter feels premium, and having used it daily for several weeks, I didn‚Äôt find any signs of wear or defects. Another crucial aspect worth mentioning is its weight, which is a manageable 1.5 pounds, making it easier to install. Even my not-so-tech-savvy coworker managed to install it in minutes. The product‚Äôs material, a high-quality activated carbon block, gives it that edge in durability while contributing significantly to its filtration functionalities.

**Ease of Installation**

If there‚Äôs one thing I dread, it‚Äôs wrestling with complicated installations‚Äîbut that wasn't the case here. With no tools required, the setup was straightforward, and the filter snapped into place like it was custom-made for my fridge. The step-by-step guide included was remarkably clear, which speaks volumes about its user-friendly design. My neighbor once complained about a competitor's filter leaking right after installation, but with this, no leaks, no hassle‚Äîjust smooth operation from day one.

**Advanced Filtration Benefits**

The advanced coconut shell carbon filtration system is where this product truly shines. This isn‚Äôt your run-of-the-mill water filter; it‚Äôs NSF Standard 42 certified, so you know it means serious business. My tap water previously had a faint chlorine smell, and I couldn‚Äôt convince myself to drink it unless it was bottled. After installing this daily-use device, the difference in water quality was like night and day‚Äîcrisp, odor-free, and genuinely refreshing. Its 99% particle filtration efficiency is particularly reassuring when you‚Äôre trying to keep your family safe from unwanted contaminants.

[Time to see BOGDA BO022-3 cost on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0d12nkjbs/)

**Strengths**

- Advanced coconut shell carbon ensures high filtration quality.
- Perfect fit without leaks or installation stress.
- Slim and compact size doesn‚Äôt waste fridge space.
- Eliminates chlorine smells, significantly improving taste.

**Performance and Efficiency**

In terms of day-to-day use, this filter takes care of up to 200 gallons of water with an expected lifespan of six months. For someone who frequently uses filtered water for coffee, tea, and daily hydration, this limit felt reasonable. I ran a quick metric comparison on how the water flavor differed before and after using it in my coffee maker, and everyone in the office agreed the espresso tasted noticeably cleaner and smoother. Even on heavy usage days, the flow rate remained steady. However, I did notice a minor but negligible drop in flow speed towards the six-month mark.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Slightly reduced water flow towards the end of its lifespan.
- Not always easy to identify compatibility with older fridge models without careful manual checks.

**Competing Products**

I‚Äôve tried similar filters like PureSource Ultra 2 and others by well-known brands. While these alternatives do a fair job at filtration, most don‚Äôt match up to the crisp taste produced by the BOGDA BO022-3‚Äôs coconut shell carbon cartridge. Many competing filters tend to leave behind microscopic black particles despite several pre-runs, which this product avoids entirely. Conversely, a few competitors boast slightly better flow rates, but they sacrifice long-term filtration effectiveness in doing so.

**Financial Value**

This water filter strikes a good balance between affordability and quality. Marketed as an alternative to pricier branded filters, the value proposition becomes apparent when you weigh its high-level performance against its competitors. It feels like a reliable and cost-effective substitute for some of the more commercially dominant but less efficient counterparts. Without providing specific numbers, I‚Äôd say it's well worth the investment, especially when factoring in longevity and the noticeable water quality improvement.

Yesterday I had a seizure which I suspect was from low blood sugar. 

Some backgroubd information. almost 10 years ago I fainted in the middle of a shop where thankfully a doctor was present and helped me out. My symtoms were resolved after he gave me a sugary drink and I felt immediately better after I regained conciousness albeit still weak. After checking it was very obviously low blood sugar, however due to my diet back then it was chucked up as simply lack of proper nutrition and that wad that. 

Now, I have suffered these years with muscle weakness, brain fog and what not though I chucked it all up as syntoms of depression which I sought treatment 2 years ago but it did not fix my weak constitution. Though I explained it to the fact that I have very little muscle mass and activity.

Yesterday is what's making me rethink my entire medical history. The symtoms were exactly as I remembered that the day I fainted, tingling of my limbs slowly spreading in my body, stiffening of my muscles and my tongue started to also get numb when I warned my husband I was about to faint and instructed him to repeat what the doctor had done to help me out that day, aka laying me down, lifting my legs and giving me a sugary drink. 


On that day, I had eaten quite well, so there was no way that it was lack of nutrition that caused it, and as usual I had had a cup of coffee.

Now I am suspecting I could be hypoglycemic? Is this a valid concern or am I mistaking my symtoms for something it is not?


Any answer would be much appreciated.

1m84ev8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RateMyStartupIdea/comments/1m84ev8/lightningfast_ways_to_validate_your_solo_startup/,Lightning-Fast Ways to Validate Your SOLO Startup Idea Before Committing,"Hey r/RateMyStartupIdea,

If you‚Äôre a **solo founder** staring at your next big idea but unsure if it‚Äôs truly needed, you‚Äôre not alone. While ‚Äúmove fast and break things‚Äù is a founder mantra, wasting months on an unvalidated idea is a luxury solopreneurs can‚Äôt afford. Through personal experience and recent research, here‚Äôs a **step-by-step, no-fluff guide to validating your solo startup idea in record time**:

---

## 1. Define Exactly What You Want to Validate

Before anything else, nail down your **validation goal**. Are you confirming actual demand? Testing whether people will pay? Or do you want honest feedback on a real-world pain point? Getting clarity on this focus helps avoid aimless busywork and hones your process.

## 2. Profile Your Target Customer

Craft simple **buyer personas** using whatever data you can quickly gather. Use LinkedIn searches, Reddit threads, or even competitor reviews to outline demographics, core needs, and online hangouts of your potential users.

## 3. Get Out and Talk to Real People

Skip endless desk research. **Direct user outreach**‚Äîcold DMs, short surveys, or joining niche Discords‚Äîwill uncover issues you haven‚Äôt considered. In-person meetups or virtual coffee chats are gold. Don‚Äôt just seek compliments; dig for objections and pain points.

> ‚ÄúThe first ask is the hardest, but after a few, you‚Äôll refine your approach.‚Äù

## 4. Leverage AI and Rapid Tools

As a solo founder, your time is precious. **AI tools** can source targeted user lists for interviews, run sentiment analysis on feedback, or even generate your first quick surveys. Use Google Trends, Twitter/X, and product forums to scan for demand signals and spot hot conversations fast.

## 5. Analyze Competitors‚ÄîBut Stay Focused

Peep current solutions: How are users complaining about them? What‚Äôs still missing? Use review mining, quick SWOT analysis, and free product demos if possible. Your goal isn‚Äôt to clone but to spot **unique opportunities** or gaps.

## 6. Create a No-Code or Low-Effort MVP

Think **landing page** with a clear value prop, ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù signup, or a simple clickable prototype (Figma, Carrd, etc.). Drive a small bit of traffic (social shares, Reddit posts, or a low-budget ad) and see if people engage, sign up, or click ‚Äúbuy‚Äù‚Äî*commitment beats compliments*.

## 7. Keep Feedback Loops Tight

Once you get input, refine. Show version 1.1 to a new batch and **iterate rapidly**. The best signals: people want to pay, sign up, or beg for early access‚Äînot just say ‚Äúcool idea!‚Äù.

---

**Key takeaway:** Even solo, validating is totally doable in a week or two if you focus on *real user problems, rapid outreach, and seeking committed interest‚ÄîNOT just friendly banter*.

What tactics or tools have *you* found most effective for super-fast validation as a solopreneur? Any hacks for getting brutally honest feedback? Let‚Äôs swap ideas below!

‚ÄúThis is probably the most beautiful coffee shop I‚Äôve ever been to. The ambiance is perfect, very lowkey and calm. A great spot to read at. Being surrounded by books with a refreshing drink and exactly what I wanted on a calm morning. I also (of course) bought a second book! The barista was so nice and really clicked with customers. There were also signs for ‚ÄúLaptops welcome before 11am)‚Äù so I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs they‚Äôre not allowed past that time. I actually really like this rule, I think it contributes to the vibe they are going for. I came at 9:30am on a Thursday, so I can‚Äôt say for sure about that. It was not busy at all. There are 2 floors to relax in. At the time I came most of the seating was taken on the first floor but hardly anyone on the 2nd (all filled with books, mind you‚ù§Ô∏è). It also seems like the afternoons and evenings cater to more of a wine crowd since there‚Äôs an entire wall of bottles. I like this a lot because it gives me a reason to come back and try those. 

I ordered a chocolate croissant and a dirty iced chai latte with whole milk. Both were delicious! I highly suggest stopping in if you‚Äôre in the area. I personally drove 35-40 minutes and was glad I did. Very worth the drive.‚Äù ",5,1753363586.0,DetroitCoffee,0,1.0,False

For context, I'm f28, I work fulltime and live on my own and I'm currently in the diagnosis process to check if I might have AuDHD (autism + adhd, adhd is confirmed, autism is not). 

I feel like ever since I became an adult and I live on my own my day only consists of getting the things that need to be done done and then at the end of the day I am so exhausted all I wanna do is lay in bed and zone out. I feel like I haven't been myself ever since moving out from home because I'm literally lacking the energy and time to put into myself and getting to know who I am and what I like and love

I feel like I have to get everything done first before I can do something fun and it takes me forever to get this stuff done and when it's done it's not done properly and then I get upset at how it's not done properly so I give up which means I finally get around to having time to do something FUN but I get overwhelmed because I don't know what I want to do so I just sit there and waste my time not deciding on what I wanna do and then the time comes around to adult again and it STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN. I wasted YEARS like this and I also developed an anxiety and panic disorder.

oh and this week I literally learned that some of my symptoms I have been experiencing are coming from endometriosis as well as orthostatic dysregulation so now I have to incorporate drinking 3 litres of water EVERY DAY, also working out, eating a balanced diet and many other things. HOW DO I DO THAT, I feel so overwhelmed already, I struggle with feeding myself because sometimes I get so overwhelmed and I don't know what to eat so I just don't eat anything. I tried mealplanning and mealprepping but I get so bored of the meals I choose or I don't want to eat them when the day arrives so the food goes bad, I'm working 40 hours a week, having to keep an apartment clean and my natural state is drinking one glass of water and three big coffees everyday! 

Replying to texts takes me forever and I have to literally dedicate a whole timeblock of my day to replying to messages because especially if they are taking some emotional intelligence to respond, it takes me forever to reply because I don't wanna give a shitty answer

And on top of that I kinda feel like I don't have a personality, I don't know who I am and what I love because I was rejected a lot during childhood/adolescence so I started masked so hard that now my existence doesn't make sense to me and I don't know who I am?! I feel like my whole life is a lie and also I feel like I'm inauthentic when I like two very opposite things like I will tell myself I'm not really an alternative girl because I not only listen to alternative rock/indie and metal but also to mainstream pop and one direction and it makes me hate myself :)

Recently my machine has broken down ( engine and turbo ) which had been replaced but when disassembled some oil fluid from the LSD leaked and need's to be changed.

My ford local parts store doesn't even know which reference of that gear oil is needed because they say that, that oil will resist for a lifetime and never needs to be changed and they never sold anything to it.

I'm not a mechanic or anything similar to that and I don't understand that much about it but could someone help me with it?

I'm based in Azores ( Portugal archipelago ) and in the island the mechanic could not find the right reference of this oil and asked the brand to order it from the mainland.

The car is ready and everything assembled but cannot drive because of that oil, yes 600ml of gear oil missing is stopping me to drive. Trying to figure out which reference is the correct one so I can hurry up the process of getting it done. Shipping times to the island normally could take around a week or more and I'm without any car for 2 months and something.

This ford part's store didn't even get me a estimate time to deliver the oil yet and it was ""ordered"" last friday.

If someone could help me with it, I gladly would offer a coffee in the island if you pass by eheh.

1m848hd,https://i.redd.it/saxdk3nzotef1.jpeg,Can anyone explain these test results to me in layman‚Äôs terms?,"My place of work has been shut down for over 3 weeks now due to testing positive for black mold. I had reported mold in the shop to my manager on June 3rd. She also told me that she definitely knew there was mold in the shop, too (she‚Äôs really young and not the brightest). She never did anything about it, so on July 1st I anonymously reported my own place of work to the health department because I was starting to get seriously ill. We got shut down immediately and haven‚Äôt been open since. I know stachybotrys is black mold, but all of my upper management is saying that these test results show that it‚Äôs ‚Äúsuch a low amount, it‚Äôs not considered to be a risk‚Äù, even though there were demolition workers wearing full protective gear while they were ripping out the walls and floors the other day. The business is a little coffee kiosk, about 400 sq feet. I also live in a state with no safety regulations or laws regarding mold, so I think that‚Äôs why they think they can say it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot considered to be unsafe‚Äù. All of upper management is being super sketchy with all of this. Is this considered to be a ‚Äúlow‚Äù amount of black mold? Does this mean the black mold was airborne?

1m847se,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1m847se/things_i_have_noticed_after_two_months_of_daily/,Things I have noticed after two months of daily Elvanse,"The first two weeks on this drug were crazy. Every day felt like I had taken a billion cup of coffees, I‚Äôd get a lot of side effects and was stressing about this being my fifth failed attempt to giving stimulants a chance. However, I couldn‚Äôt live like I did anymore so I just told my anxiety that I‚Äôm gonna give this drug two weeks and if it kills me so be it. Without over exaggeration, the first 3 days on it when it kicked in after about 90 minutes of taking it I HAD to move around. I was so hyper to the point I walked circles in my backyard for an hour at the peak. It got me questioning if this med was right for me and whether this was gonna pass. The crash was godawful, I had to lay in bed when it wore off (I knew exactly when that was) with a blindfold and earplugs in because I was so overstimulated I couldn‚Äôt handle anything for about 2 hours or so. Mind you this was on only 20mg, and I‚Äôm average weight/height as a 23 year old dude.

After a week some side effects went away and after two most of them were gone. Ever since, every side effect that was left sticked around (physically speaking). My only long term side effects on this drug are very frequent urination and elevated hr and bp.

After about a month everything levelled out. I was not getting this hyperactive feeling anymore and it was nice but it felt like the med lost some of it‚Äôd effectiveness. I upped the dosage to 30mg and tried for a few days but it was too much, went back to 20mg.

Now two months in I upped again this week to 30mg and all good so far. But there is some things I‚Äôm noticing right now which really intrigue me of which I would like some of you to weigh in with your thoughts.

Here is the deal: I don‚Äôt even take Elvanse primarily for my ADHD. I‚Äôve rawdogged it all my life without meds since my diagnosis at 14 years old but learned to live with my brain (or so I thought). When I started meds I felt so different, I literally felt stupid and dumb. Why? Because I would try to think about things and it was like the meds blocked it. And then I realized that this was exactly what was supposed to happen‚Ä¶

This made me do a lot of self reflecting. I got so used to my brain being so activated and on at all times that it was foreign to me that I would now have to think about one thing at a time instead of a dozen.

My fast problem solving thinking plummeted but I can read a book now.

Always having an answer ready in a conversation went to me thinking of an answer in the moment and the silence in between not being catastrophically awkward in my brain. 

But most importantly, the reason I still take this med to this day besides all the things it does for my adhd: How it treats my anxiety. I tried EVERYTHING, from SSRI‚Äôs to benzo‚Äôs to CBT, Talk therapy, ACT, EMDR, Psychoeducation, microdosing shrooms, quitting caffeine, alcohol and drugs, breathing exercises, cold showers, exercise and so much more. But nothing helped until I took Elvanse.

Without meds I just spiral like crazy and cannot stop feeding my (mainly) health anxiety. To the point where I would be on google for hours a day even tho I knew I wasn‚Äôt supposed to do that, I just couldn‚Äôt stop.

Now it‚Äôs like I have control over it, I‚Äôm a completely different person. I don‚Äôt think about my anxiety all day anymore and I can just stop thinking and ruminating about it. My panic attacks stopped and my anxiety levels went way down, I don‚Äôt wake up every morning with my heart pounding and a doom feeling anymore.

Now my question is this: Why if it does all these things to me in a good way, does it not help me with INITIATING executive functioning. Whenever I‚Äôm in that focus I‚Äôm in there but it‚Äôs way harder for me to actually start doing something because I‚Äôm already quite okay with doing nothing, and am unmotivated to do that thing I need to do. Once I‚Äôm doing it I get into that hyperfocus but getting myself to do it is really tough. It‚Äôs comparable to me to a period back in my life years ago when I used to self medicate with smoking weed daily, I was just okay with doing nothing.

My guess is that I stop chasing dopamine because I have enough on meds, whereas of meds I will always be looking to get more. But then how do meds generally speaking improve executive functioning? I have more questions but this seems to be the main one lately.",3,1753363149.0,VyvanseADHD,3,0.8,False

 Just before I have you read below I want you to know, I am building this game based around Singleplayer and Optional co-op which will be Player Hosted.  
Each Player will have 3 Player Saves and 3 World Saves and can bring their Player progress to their friends session.

Today I have both the new UI Design implemented (while not fully functional in certain aspects), and the Upgrade System for weapons in place!

**User Interface**

*  The User Interface contains the 4 key elements at the top of the screen, (Skills and Player customization is in the works) which allow you to access your Inventory of gear, Map & Quests/World Info, Character Customization/Skills and finally Codex's which will be the way I am implementing lore within the world.
* The Design of the UI ensures every piece of info you want to see is clear & readable whilst being easily traversed on a controller or keyboard.
* If you interact with the Weapon Upgrade Bench it will add the ""Upgrades"" to the inventory to access for the duration that you are at the bench

FEEDBACK NEEDED:

* Do you find the UI clear on what your looking for and where it is contained?
* Is the style of the UI in its current state appealing to look at? If not, what do you think should be altered?
* Is there information missing that you would prefer to see within the UI?

**Weapon Upgrades**

* Each weapon when acquired begins at level 0. To level a weapon you must use the parts you gain from dismantling unneeded weapons.
* To upgrade a weapon, you must interact with a Weapon Upgrade Bench out in the world.
* You can spend scraps to upgrade a weapons level up to a maximum of level 3. Each level unlocks a new Mod Slot for that weapon.
* To Roll Mods you must have the required resources from common - mythic, however this cost is based on the previously slotted rolls. For example if you have a mythic mod already allocated, it will cost an amount of mythic resource to roll again.
* For every level your weapon gains another slot for a mod to roll in, culminating in all 3 slots being unlocked at level 3. Each roll will overwrite any previous mods and re-roll every unlocked slot. 
* A common weapon can only earn mods from the common mod pool, and from the mods associated with that weapon type. (Certain weapon types will have their own mods)

FEEDBACK NEEDED

* Do you like the concept of this system I have designed?
* What Mods would you like to see incorporated with the weapons?
* Is the Information clear on what each mod will do to the weapon? 

  
I hope you all are enjoying what you see here, and I would really appreciate any feedback even if its critically harsh! If you also want to communicate further or offer in-depth ideas do join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/44thRrsJ) here.  
Also if you would like to support me in any way you can always [buy me a coffee](http://coff.ee/auesip)! In the next post I will be showing some early AI Development which contains Passive, Melee and Ranged enemies.

1m8409o,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m8409o/when_did_you_ever_question_a_dating_app/,When did you ever question a dating app,"I used to swipe without a second thought. Like most people, I just assumed dating apps were a necessary evil, a digital meat market, but ultimately harmless. Just profiles, chats, a few awkward first dates. You know, normal stuff.

When did I ever question a dating app? Never. Not until it led me to Alex.

Her profile was‚Ä¶ adequate. Pretty enough, a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes, which I found intriguing. Her bio was a standard collection of interests: hiking, indie music, vintage arcade games. All perfectly acceptable. We matched.

Our initial chats were easy, almost too easy. She flowed well. We talked about her work, her hobbies, what she was binging on Netflix. I found myself subtly guiding the conversation, nudging her towards topics that revealed more about her habits, her routines, her vulnerabilities.

One Tuesday, she mentioned a particularly rough day at work. My fingers flew across the keyboard. ""Sounds like you'd be... tender after that,"" I typed, a small smile playing on my lips. ""Hope you get some good rest."" She responded with a laughing emoji, completely oblivious. It was always so easy to plant the seeds.

Then came the hiking. She excitedly told me about a solo trip she was planning to a specific, less-known trail. ""Perfect weather for that,"" I messaged back. ""Builds up quite an appetite, doesn't it? For... a good meal afterwards, of course."" She just said, ""Haha, definitely! A big burger for me!"" Bless her innocence. She had no idea how right she was about the ""appetite.""

We finally set up a date. A coffee shop, neutral ground. I arrived early, settled in, and watched her walk in. She was just as I'd anticipated. A little nervous, a little eager. Her scent was... promising.

The conversation started normally. I watched her, absorbing every detail. The way her eyes crinkled when she laughed, the nervous habit of twisting a strand of hair. I mirrored her gestures, a subtle dance of mimicry. If she leaned forward, I leaned forward. If she touched her hair, my hand would brush my own. It was a practice, a way to fully inhabit her space, to understand her rhythms. My eyes, I knew, were fixed on her, but not in an engaged way. It was an appraisal. A careful, meticulous assessment. I caught myself glancing at the soft curve of her throat, the delicate bones of her wrists, the plumpness of her hands.

Then, the moment that confirmed everything.

She was talking about dreams, and I saw my opening. I mentioned a ""dream"" I'd had. ""You know,"" I said, my voice perfectly calm, ""I had the strangest dream last night. It was about a cold, empty space. And a very distinct scent... like iron, but sweet. And a feeling of... anticipation. Like something was about to be prepared.""

Her face went white. Her coffee cup clattered against the saucer. Her hands started to shake, violently. ""What did you just say?"" she whispered.

I tilted my head, my smile, I imagined, perfectly serene. ""Just a dream. Weird, right? Anyway, you were saying something about your cat?""

She didn't hear the rest. She stood up abruptly, knocking her chair back. ""I... I have to go,"" she stammered, backing away from the table. The fear in her eyes was a delicious, almost palpable thing.

She practically ran out of the coffee shop. I watched her go, a slow, satisfied warmth spreading through me. She deleted the dating app the moment she got home, I knew. Changed passwords, scrubbed her online presence. She felt violated, exposed. Good. The hunt had begun.

That night, I didn't sleep. I was too excited. Every shadow was an ally. Every sound outside was just the world waiting. I kept picturing Alex's face, her fear, the way her body had tensed.

The next morning, the app was gone from my phone. I scrolled through my photos, a private collection. And then I saw it.

A new photo in my gallery. One I had taken.

It was a selfie. Of me. Sleeping.

And in the very corner of the shot, barely visible in the dim light, was a tall, impossibly thin shadow. Its head long, its mouth a gaping, black tear. The same figure I'd seen in the dark corner of my room, the one I'd described to you. It wasn't a demon. It was me. My true self, revealed in the absence of the world's blinding, judging light. The hunger made manifest.

But this time, on my nightstand, directly in the foreground, was something small, white, and perfectly clean.

A single, human finger bone. Smooth, polished. A memento.

It hadn't just learned her dreams. It had been in her room. And it wasn't just watching. It was *feeding*.

When did I ever question a dating app? I never did. Not when it so efficiently delivered my next meal.",4,1753362625.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1m84044,https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/1m84044/hey_fam_i_spent_over_a_year_in_jail_and_a_few/,Hey fam! I spent over a year in jail and a few months in prison. Here's how it all works üç´üçú,"TL;DR Hey H3 crew I been there. Jail and Prison are very different. Jail has limited stuff and is meant for short term life including smaller snack selection where certain prisons have MUCH more stuff meant for long term living. This all depends on security measures of course :)  
  
  
Hey guys, so I'm not proud of everything back then but I was a desperate drug user for a while until 7 years ago (My life is completely turned around now) - My credentials is that five years ago I made a [musical song about jail](https://youtu.be/dzVKHwqTN2k?t=31) kind of making fun of some of stuff they talked about on the show with Jail.  

So y'all probably know that JAIL and PRISON are different things even though they seem similar. Jail is where you go to await trial or sentencing or to do time for misdemeanors. Prison is where you go to do time with felons. Long term sentence criminals.

\-----------------------------------------------------------

JAIL is VERY easy like Ethan says at first. You can just lie down and read books all day and it helps, but you are in a bay or room with 7 others and tensions get very high. Being enclosed in a tight area can confuse the mind. Fights break out every so often when the inmates couldn't decide if they should watch Cops or Two Broke Girls.  
In JAIL and in PRISON people can 'put money on your books' from the outside and the process is simple. So yeah that means if you are rich you are going to live very good in the system compared to others. Poor people (as I was) do get 'indigent packs' of hygiene items.   
JAIL commissary is limited. The most important items that are used as currency are Ramen (they are called 'soups in jail) and Instant Coffee. A ramen is worth like 2 shots of coffee.  Other popular things in jail are Honeybuns, Bags of Chips (especially to mix with soup) and Hot Sauce (Also to mix with soup in a bag)

\-------------------------------------------------------------

Prison can be very easy or hard depending on security.   
Medium security is the dangerous prison that you see about on TV. Beyond that people are locked up most of the day. I was in a minimum security place which was very lax.   
In prison I had my own dorm room in a big building and shared with one other. Many inmates trained dogs where I was.  Yeah so commissary in PRISON is huge. You can buy televisions, brand name shoes, bagels, sausages, coffee makers and watches. I rented a guitar every day. Also YES Ethan you can get gameboys in Prison, you can buy handheld devices where you can pay to send Emails and on those devices you can download and play shit mobile games.  
  
  
Okay if you read all that thank you so much. If you have ANY question ask away! I'm totally open about the experience!

so far my thoughts on the game.

in order to fully enjoy it I highly recommend purchasing the Ad free pack. Then that's it. All the bonuses you get for skipping ads are necessary to have a nice stream of progress without hard walls.  
the game play is super addicting since you can literally play constantly without being idle to make progress. Honestly i feel like it's more active play than idle. This game isn't very idle focused apart for the cooldown on opening booster packs and the ad skipping bonuses since you can only use the bonuses 20-30 times per days on specific boosts. but its enough trust me. i can do a solid 2 hour session playing lol

i would have to say this game needs a lot of work on balancing. Having the large mixers and jam makers be rare cards vs the normal blenders being common makes it very unbalanced along with the permanent perk upgrade tree. By the end of the game my normal blenders were out performing the end game machines by tripe the revenue if not more. Needing far less resources and time to make the juice as well just added more insult to injury.  
the only reason i were to build jam makers etc is because i had to in order to finish an island.   
the events need to be scaled for the player's actual account perks you win during the normal game. jumping from island to island says it increases your revenue stream across the board, but it doesn't help you in events...so there really isn't a point to this increase currency bonus you get for completing an island. its not like you can skip islands either so i see it as a cosmetic upgrade?

another gripe is the epic and legendary cards are extremely rare....but they're kinda useless? except for maybe two cards. but they aren't needed to beat the game at all. so the player doesn't need to buy these expensive booster packs to win, we don't have a reason to. which is cool i guess for free to play players, but i mean why have epic cards and legendary if they aren't that helpful? i dont  wanna log on every three hours just to get some cash, or once every 10 hours on the nose to collect 25 common cards. (another reason common mixers are over powered they level too fast) list goes on.

anyways, the events are 100% made to frustrate you into purchasing temp boosts just to compete the event...but keep in mind you don't even need to events. i did the mine event twice and the coffee event once. and thats it. you never get near to finishing the event since you NEED to spend money to finish them. kinda pointless when you have overpowered blenders making all the money. again, no need to upgrade the higher tier mixing machines. 

  
but overall the game was super fun and i highly recommend it if you are searching for a game to play. honestly not grindy i found it fun as hell.",1,1753362577.0,mobilegameology,0,1.0,False

To add a little information about myself, I'm a guy that had (and to some degree still has) their self-esteem tied to never having a girlfriend (29 years old). I did coaching for 6 months with an awesome coach, and after having some better dating experiences (and no longer feeling horribly upset, understanding compatibility, standards, etc. + other aspects to my life), I decided to embark on my own, and slowly use the energy I used for dating more torwards everyday social interactions.

  
Things felt like they were getting better and better when it came to the social aspect of my life. I started to have more positive interactions, with both men and women, and to a certain degree I kinda started to feel a little popular (internally) at the rock-climbing gym I frequently go to. I Started to get more like-minded friends, and with some effort, I also started to think less about what others about me especially when I didn't have some sort of stellar interaction with someone.

  
To get to the problem, I joined an upper-intermediate climbing group, primarily to get better at climbing, but I also wanted to meet some more people. The majority of the group is made up of women (there are only 2 other men), so I found myself being a little shy at first, but I still do my best to be friendly to everyone. Unfortunately, I feel like i'm being ignored by the women in the group. When I say ""hi"" at the beginning of our session, they sometimes don't even respond. When they do, they just say a quick hi, and nothing more. Any further interaction is usually responded by a few words or just a sentence. Additionally, we had a little tournament and I got last place. Everyone was clapping for each other, but when my result came up, only a couple people clapped or had any encouragement. This made me feel really inadequate, and I just feel like I don't belong there. I know I shouldn't care, and I shouldn't feel inadequacy because of others, but I still do. I know i'm not doing anything wrong, because I feel like i'm on good terms with one of the guys, and I actually had a coffee with one the women in the group and I actually got to know her a little bit.

  
This feeling just sucks, and I am not really sure what to do.",1,1753362473.0,Healthygamergg,0,1.0,False

I matched her a month ago, chatted for a few days and realised how fun she seemed. We had a brunch date and walked after, everything seemed great and we had loads of similarities. Then when I tried organising the second date which she was definitely up for she hit me with a busy schedule for 2 weeks and in fairness to her she really was - we moved the chat over to socials and she agrees as she supposedly doesn't go on Hinge that much, she messages every day, asks about my day, talks about her personal life and there's the occasional flirt / self bullying thing going on. But here's the first flag, she offered up weekend days 2 weeks in advance or a sooner sunday, I chose the sunday and made a chill plan, but she asked me to hold until she spoke to family about getting a lift to the train station.  
  
Two weeks go by and just as I'm about to ask if she can plan anything in she goes out with her friends for drinks, messages me mid way through the night asking if I was free the next day for a coffee, then maybe food next week as I should be inviting her to my city.. kind of frustrated because I had been trying I accepted but sadly the next day she cancels due to a hangover and dare I say it; in fairness she also prewarned me it may happen - I was also on the backside of some flu so it kind of helped me out.. I ask for her weeks plans and she ignored that specific message. We chat a little more and by Monday I ask for her plans again and she sends the ""I'm busy every day except maybe sunday"" - I choose sunday and she says ""let me double check my plans are saturday and not sunday, I should be good though"". Immediately I'm now sensing some hesitation which I had a vague feeling about 2 weeks ago, maybe she was just a little hazy/giddy from drinking with her friends and over planned with her suggestions.  
  
No response to the ""alright let me know"" so I message her in a pretty safe way explaining that I really appreciate her effort and energy, I hope it doesn't come off badly but I wanted to check if she was still in for a second date. I explained I totally get she runs a busy lifestyle and I respect it and she has her own feelings, but I sense a bit of hesitation and I'd rather her be honest.  
  
She then pretty quickly replies apologising and repeats that the past 2 weeks have been manic which I already knew and didn't hold against her. But for that reason she likes to be more slow paced and chill with ""stuff like this"" moving too fast stresses her out. She explained living 45 minutes apart makes it difficult for her to do last minute weekday dates even though I've tried planning both weekend and weekday in advance, I even offer to travel to her which she doesn't appeal to. And then she finishes it off saying ""I've only met you for an hour or two before so can't say I'm 100% sure on anything"" which I think she misinterpreted me asking what we were; which I wasn't, but then ""I just can't commit to doing stuff all the time straight away or putting all my energy into one thing..""  
  
Am I crazy for trying to stick it out any longer having given her nearly a month? From day 1 I got a sense that she was very self sufficient and I knew this might be a challenge, but our personalities and similarities clicked a little too well, the fact she checks in with me daily, opens up to flirting at times and still messages me when she's out with her friends really confuses me. The reason I've stuck it out so far is her personality kind of trapped me and I hadn't felt this way in ages.  
  
Maybe this is just modern day dating and girls wanting to really ease into things slowly, I'm not pushy, I understand she values time with her friendship groups and also has a very demanding but successful career. I just need advice on whether this is what I should be expecting with some girls",6,1753362017.0,hingeapp,9,0.88,False
1m83quq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1m83quq/aita_for_not_committing_to_plans_with_my_friends/,AITA for not committing to plans with my friends,"My (31F) 2 friends Jane and Kate (30F) and I have in the last year found ourselves hardly seeing each other due to life changes, mostly due to one moving to another country and everyone becoming more busy. 

Jane suggested we do a video meet this week and all have coffee and cake during it together, make it a proper coffee date which I agreed was a good idea. Jane and Kate quickly arranged a day and time this week (a weekday evening) and then I saw the messages and said I‚Äôm not available that day but gave all the other days (in the same week) that I am. All of these were weekday evenings we were discussing. Kate said she‚Äôs not available on any of those. 

Kate then suggested a Sunday 2 weeks away and the time was late afternoon to accommodate time difference and make it a good time for everyone. I was honest and said I can‚Äôt commit way in advance to a phone call on a weekend day as we may have plans come up eventually or even go for a day out on a whim which is how we usually do things on weekends, but that I can still see on the day if it‚Äôs possible and if everyone else is free. I also said they‚Äôre both free to go ahead with the original day they both were free on for now and I‚Äôll join them another time. 

Neither Kate nor Jane said anything and it‚Äôs been a week now of silence and I‚Äôm wondering if I said something wrong or offensive by saying I won‚Äôt commit to a phone call with them in that specific context. 

If it was meeting them in person sure I‚Äôd make proper plans and keep myself free in advance like we‚Äôve always done, but to commit to staying in all day on a Sunday 2 weeks in advance for just a phone call in the middle of the day, and which would be an hour at the most seems silly to me. It prevents us being able to go out anywhere as there‚Äôs not enough time before or after it so I‚Äôd be home all day just for that, and we do usually decide the day before or even on the day what we‚Äôd like to do. 

And the video is not something I could do whilst out as obviously it would be disturbing what I‚Äôm doing with my partner and family and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to focus on a video phone call either in public, plus they wanted to do it as a proper coffee date set up. Weekends are quite precious and staying in for a phone call in the middle of the day seems unnecessary to me when it can easily be done in weekdays. 

I made it clear that I can do nearly all weekday evenings (just not that one day that was first suggested) and commit to those in advance too which was the original plan presented to start with anyway.

Also to add Sunday is not a weekend day in Kate‚Äôs country so she is only suggesting a weekday evening to her to not disturb any weekends for herself, which is the same as myself. ",1,1753361970.0,AmItheAsshole,19,1.0,False

How do you ensure you‚Äôre getting enough protein without relying on shakes?

For some context:

I had my RNY in November of 2022. I‚Äôve lost 80lbs total from it. My weight loss completely stopped for over a year, some of which is my own fault. 

I still have about 50lbs to lose. I started on Trulicity for some extra help, then moved to Ozempic, which didn‚Äôt seem to work for me. 

I‚Äôm now on Mounjaro and just took my 2nd shot. I‚Äôm definitely noticing a decrease in appetite. Just yesterday I noticed I made it to 2pm without eating anything! Of course I only noticed because I started to feel pretty sick from not eating (I‚Äôm also diabetic, so my blood sugar went low from not eating). 


If anyone is also on weight loss meds after surgery, how did you get your protein in? I feel full (almost sick) after just a few bites since starting the Mounjaro, so there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm getting enough protein, probably not even half! 

When I first had surgery I used a mix of a protein shake and unflavored protein powder as coffee creamer to help meet my numbers, but I am hesitant to do that again. The powder and shakes are pricey and I‚Äôm also noticing that coffee may not be agreeing with me anymore as I‚Äôm starting to feel nauseous when I have it.

I love how they keep the name and absolutely nothing else. 

Egg rolls/nems? Fabulous. Nothing remotely East Asian. But still very delicious. 

Tacos (which yes, I know ‚ÄúFrench tacos‚Äù were made in France by a North African- probably Algerian- immigrant, but they‚Äôre still an essential part of the Moroccan international food scene for me)? Sublime. Not remotely like the classic Mexican taco, but semantic broadening is a beautiful thing and they‚Äôre their very own category. French fries in a tortilla? You go, you funky little chef. Destroy my cholesterol. 

Tiramisu? Anything with lady fingers and some sort of flavoring with some fluffy cream is called tiramisu here, and it‚Äôs beautiful. Not Italian in the least, usually not a spec of coffee powder in sight, but still beautiful. 

Chwarma? Anything with marinated chopped chicken that‚Äôs roasted gets slapped with the label here, and I ain‚Äôt mad. Some of it is closer to actual Lebanese/middle eastern shawarma, and some is more like chicken salad with spices, but again, not mad. It‚Äôs always a little bit of a surprise where on the spectrum a certain ‚Äúshawarma‚Äù will fall. 

And finally, sushi, my beloved. A lot of it is actually pretty authentic or close to it, but then you go and do things like ‚Äúsushi tacos‚Äù or just slap some tuna salad in a roll. Beautiful. I love the mix of familiar and new in any sampler platter. 


It‚Äôs too hot in my kitchen to have the motivation to do much cooking, so I‚Äôve been eating out more. And I just had visitors from home and got to introduce them to some of my favorite new takes on old classics, so it got me thinking. 

Of course, local versions of cultural cuisines are nothing new, but Morocco is definitely the most ‚Äúout there‚Äù version of some of these things that I‚Äôve seen, and I‚Äôve travelled a lot. They really seem to keep only the name and like, one or two base ingredients and go wild with the rest, and I appreciate the creativity.

1m83lzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1m83lzx/aitah_for_looking_through_my_bfs_phone_with_his/,AITAH for looking through my bfs phone with his permission?,"Sorry if I mess up because English is not my first language;( Ps: I really love u charlotteee
So for a little context I(24f) and my bf(24m) are dating for 6 months now. But we have a really messy background. We met 3 years ago in school when ƒ± was retaking a year. He caught my attention I went and met him and we like instantly started flirting. We went like 3 coffee dates and than a cinema date which everything went terribly wrong. At that last date I decided he wasn‚Äôt the one I was looking for. And I am not proud of the things I done later. 
So after that date I practically started ghosting him and when he continued to message I said ‚Äú I am not in a phase of dating and have family issues ‚Äú which was not nice I know. But somehow because we were still taking same classes in such we stayed friends. After a year during a drunken talk I told him the real reason I didn‚Äôt want him back then was he wasn‚Äôt masculine enough for me and he didn‚Äôt even have the m in masculinity. I know I am a shitty person.
Years have passed we were still friends and last year he suddenly became friends with a girl who I am definitely not in good terms with. It is a long story but she was my bff once and now my only enemy (even my parents are mad at her kinda way) This is important in later context.
At January this year something somehow shifted between us. This past 3 years changed both of us a lot. I could see he was flirty again with me and I gave it a thought and noticed I can see a future with him after all. So I pursued him he was sceptical at first but gave in and we have been together since.
So when we come to the real story (sorry for long introduction) we have a very open relationship. We are always honest to each other and don‚Äôt hide anything. I know his password and he always leaves his phone with me. A month ago I saw an unflattering photo of me with the ex friend of mine on his phone. I asked him about it and he told me I can look through his phone. So, I didn‚Äôt find anything about it in his phone it was just a short convo in a group chat but I later asked him if I can keep looking and he said yes. So I got into a chat with a really close friend of him and searched my name. I know I was a b word before but I found texts from years ago like how his friend never liked me, or him comparing me to his ex gf and telling we are the same s*it. 
When I was reading the messages he saw what I found took his phone back and told me he never thought I could find those and I am too dangerous to look at his phone again. For this last month he guards his phone like a fortress. Sometimes I ask to look and he bluntly says no. Yesterday he told me he will not allow it again at least before he deletes old messages. 
I mean I never blamed him for the previous messages, or never look through his phone without permission although I had the chance. But he acts like I am some kind of psycho. 

So , AITAH for looking through his phone with permission?

Mid 2020, I got a twitch in my arm, a hotspot, which lasted a couple of days. Initially I thought it was due to repetitive strain injury, working on my laptop and/or drinking too much coffee. The hotspot went away and I didn‚Äôt think too much of it until after around 4 weeks I got a hotspot somewhere else. This time I started worrying and called my GP. GP said I shouldn‚Äôt worry and that it was in all likelihood nothing. A couple of months later the twitches became a bit more frequent and I really started to worry.

I talked to the GP and went to the neurologist and did some tests. They tried to reassure me, the neurologist didn‚Äôt see any point in doing an EMG. Even though I was still worried about serious muscle diseases but rationally somewhere it got through me that I didn‚Äôt have any life threatening disease. It just took time to realize this and I am glad this 'phase' is somewhat behind me. So give yourself some time for this.

Since then the twitches never left. Years went by with occassional hotspots, sometimes frequent, sometimes a couple of weeks without hotspots, just twitching. However, I never really got to peace with them, I was always looking for causality going through all the possible causes.

Last year, I got so hyperfixated and stressed about my twitches that I got really worked up about them. My work and private life suffered through this obviously. I went through therapy and decided to take lexapro. I think a combination of meditation, lexapro and acceptance did help me, but the frequent twitching is still there and I can‚Äôt say I am 100% at peace with them. Will I ever be? Note that I am not worried about MND, it is just the hotspots poppin up here and there that work and keep me up. I dont have the confidence in my body anymore, I previously had. The unpredictability works me up!! You try everything and they still come :). 

I think at the end we just have to get to somehow, someway accept the twitches? I was wondering how are you dealing with the symptoms and how do you make sure it doesn‚Äôt interrupt your sleep? Do you get to the stage where you accept your twitches? What sleeping tricks or meds work for you? Do benzo‚Äôs work for you? Advice is always appreciated.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/ArUBWMZU4T)  **June 14th, 2025**

My husband I have been together for 8 years, the last 3 we‚Äôve been married. Little things keep adding up and I don‚Äôt even know how to approach these issues. He wants kids soon but I can‚Äôt trust that he‚Äôd support me. I‚Äôm trying to figure out if I try to work on us or just leave. 

Recently as in the last 4 years, I have been dealing with chronic health issues but just this year alone I‚Äôve had 3 surgeries to fix various things for my health. Our sex life hasn‚Äôt been good in a few years since I got ill. Maybe once or twice a month, he has told me that it‚Äôs not enough and he‚Äôs feeling rejected and is making his mental health worse but if we have kids we won‚Äôt be able to have sex while I‚Äôm recovering?

I work 5-6 days a week 12 hour night shifts in healthcare. I am the primary breadwinner in our relationship, he bounces from job to job and recently was unemployed for over a year while he was claiming to be applying to jobs. I know the job market is horrible right now so I wasn‚Äôt pushing. I found out he was lying, he hadn‚Äôt applied for anything in about 6 months including the jobs I got him recommended for through some connections I have. We got into a massive fight and I basically told him if he didn‚Äôt have a job at the end of the month I was leaving and he could figure out bills himself. Not even a week later he was back working at his old job. 

I still do all the cooking, cleaning, and household upkeep. On my days off I spend 3-4 hours just putting everything in order for the week. Even when he wasn‚Äôt working he wasn‚Äôt doing anything except playing video games in another room while I slept, so when I‚Äôd wake up there would be laundry I‚Äôd have to switch or cat litter I‚Äôd have to scoop. 

He wants kids soon, but with my chronic health problems it‚Äôs going to make children a really hard process on my body, lots of health risks and I would basically have to be on bed rest the whole time and in and out of doctor appointments. I couldn‚Äôt work or do anything really and I‚Äôm just scared I won‚Äôt get the support that I need. I don‚Äôt even know if I want to have kids with him anymore. 

He gets money every month from a settlement and he says it‚Äôs enough to make up for the income I won‚Äôt be bringing in if I get pregnant. The settlement payout every month is less than  1/4 of what I make in 2 weeks. 

I feel like I‚Äôm his mother already, I feel like I‚Äôd be one of those married single mothers‚Ä¶. 

I‚Äôve asked him about therapy, individual or couples and he is dismissive. Saying therapy hasn‚Äôt helped in the past. So I‚Äôve asked about medications but he doesn‚Äôt want to take a pill everyday. 

I don‚Äôt want to come across as horrible or manipulative but I‚Äôm about ready to write out everything I do, bill payments, chores, time I‚Äôm at work, etc. and have him do it all for a month then tell me he thinks we can have kids right now.




Edit (6/14 @2300):

A few things since this is a real story and not AI. And I am a real person who is making choices in order to keep up with the current economy and situation- 

1)I work the hours I do so I can build up my PTO and sick time for my procedures and recovery time. Yes I have FMLA for these but it only pays out 60% of my wage vs 100% if I use PTO. Overtime accrues PTOx2 and pays time and a half, we also have a pick up bonus of $10 an hour. I have been working at this hospital since 2015 as a CNA and phlebotomist since 2018 and an RN since 2020 so I have seniority and that comes benefits, Yay unions!

2)I work night shift because it has the flexibility for my schedule and they work with me for my restrictions. I am lucky enough to work in a hospital that uses lifts and is staffed as well as can be currently. Shift differential also gives me an additional $6 an hour and that quickly adds up. 

3) My surgeries were laparoscopic, and recovery time is about 1-4 weeks on average. Surgery 1 and 3 were both exploratory. My second was to remove a lesion on my intestines that connected them to my abdominal wall as well as a cyst on my ovary, and recovery was 4 weeks with 4 more on restrictions. I am about to have a 4th surgery to remove my gallbladder, recovery is 1-2 weeks with 2 weeks of recovery. Yes I have had a lot of surgeries this year but I haven‚Äôt had any before this unless you count upper and lower GI scopes, pelvic floor testing, gastric emptying test, X-rays, CTs, an MRI, labs, genetic testing, and HIDA scans. Or maybe the diet changes and medications that you have to be on for months at a time before you‚Äôd see any really changes. I also have the birth control implant and me coming off of that would involve about 3 different doctors‚Äô inputs and oversight. 

4) I blocked all of my husbands accounts and his friends accounts that I know of. I plan on deleting this at some point, but I‚Äôve just gotten angrier with each comment and everything I type out. At this point I don‚Äôt care if he finds this. Maybe it would be a wake up call he needs. 

5)Our wedding was supposed to take place in November of 2020. That obviously didn‚Äôt happen. We rescheduled to the end of 2021 so we didn‚Äôt loose deposits. He quit his job about 2 months after our wedding. 

6)People do things like meal prep for a week and find relaxation in cooking. My hospital provides scrubs. When I am home I have more than 6 pairs of underwear. So it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt have clothes if I don‚Äôt do laundry every day. 

I appreciate all the comments but to the rude ones especially please remember that I am a real person. I‚Äôm sorry I have to justify every small detail of my health problems for you. Unfortunately the knee brace girl in middle school sometimes grows up and still has health problems. :)

This is my first time being alive and not everything is going to be perfect. I am trying my best and sometimes people do stupid things because they love someone. 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/ZnPQw3mIx4)  **July 16th, 2025**

Hello again Reddit, my previous post is on my page. I tried to link it but the pain medication might be impairing me. 

I had my surgery a few days ago and since I have time off I figured I‚Äôd write an update for anyone curious. It will be long and I apologize. 

TLDR: I tried to have one more discussion with him before I threw in the towel. He asked for an open marriage and I told him to move out. Papers are being filed and I have lawyer. 

I talked with my lawyer last week and the hope is papers are to be drafted and he will be formally served when he comes back from his work trip in 2 weeks. 

On one of my days off I wanted to have a discussion about our relationship and it didn‚Äôt go well. I had spent the night cleaning and getting the house put together because my anxiety was so bad. When he woke up in the morning I had breakfast made and we made just made polite small talk. 

I started the conversation by asking him if he was happy in our relationship, I‚Äôll summarize the conversation: 

Me: are you happy like this? With us? I feel like we are roommates more than a married couple.. 

Him: I don‚Äôt think either of us have been happy for a while‚Ä¶ I do still love you and what to raise children with you, you‚Äôll be a great mom‚Ä¶ I have been meaning to talk to you about something 

Me: ‚Ä¶okay‚Ä¶

Him: do you remember my friends in (city)? And how they were having problems in their relationship after (fake name) came out as ace? How they opened their relationship so (fake name) could still get his‚Ä¶ needs‚Ä¶ met. (At this point I was just staring at him, he kept rambling on) I‚Äôve joined some groups online, they said it saved their marriage. And with how much I‚Äôm traveling now for work. It would be every other 2 weeks, you know. And I‚Äôm in (city name) so it‚Äôs not like it would be someone you know or would ever meet‚Ä¶ 

Me: what the fuck?

Him: I mean think about it, we could have a surrogate this way. I know it would be a lot but we could make it work. You‚Äôve always talked about fostering or adopting and it would be just like that. 

Me: did you get someone pregnant? Is this your way of telling me you cheat on me when you travel for work? 

Him: no no no, god no, there was one girl at the bar who was flirting with me and it just felt nice to be wanted like that. 

He then pulled out his phone and started showing me ‚Äúsupport‚Äù groups he had joined online for poly people in monogamous relationships. There was probably 3 or 4 of them that he had been texting in for the last few weeks trying to gain the confidence to talk to me about opening up our relationship. He brought up how he knows I‚Äôve been thinking about switching to travel contracts and I can meet people there but then we come back home we‚Äôre together and married because we still love each other. 

I have nothing against people who are in poly relationships, we have friends who are and have met their partners and go out all together. It‚Äôs just not for me, when I‚Äôm with someone I want to be the only person they‚Äôre with. I don‚Äôt want to get tested regularly, I don‚Äôt want to risk surprise pregnancy, I don‚Äôt want to feel jealous or wonder if he‚Äôs texting another girl while he‚Äôs supposed to be spending time with me. 

I let him finish his speech before I told him it hasn‚Äôt felt like we‚Äôve been married in a long time and I‚Äôm done. Hearing that he wants to see other people killed any last feelings I may have had. I‚Äôm not in love anymore and staying together isn‚Äôt going to make either of us happy. We both want kids but our timelines are different, what we want from the future is different now. I asked him to move out and he didn‚Äôt seem surprised. I walked away and left him in the kitchen before I drove to my friend‚Äôs house since I just couldn‚Äôt be there. We spent the day drinking and eating ice cream while I went from crying to laughing to screaming. 

She is currently going through a divorce over her ex husbands porn addiction and the debt he put them in because of it. She gave me her lawyers information and I had an appointment set up with him a few days later. 


I went home the next day and he had moved most of his stuff out, his side of the closet is empty, his cat, the stuff in the bathroom, a few of our wedding pictures have been taken off the wall and I can‚Äôt find them so I think he took them, and his gaming set up. 

The house feels incredibly empty now. He travels for work so I‚Äôm used to being in the house alone but now my toothbrush is lonely in the cup on the sink. Our garage feels bigger now, the bed get cold, I only have to cook for one now. I miss his presence, I miss having someone to come home too, and I won‚Äôt lie I‚Äôve spent the last week crying and my heart hurts. 

We didn‚Äôt speak for a few days after he left, his mom reached out before he did. She wanted to see how I was doing and if there was anything she could do for me. We had a great relationship and I‚Äôm honestly going to miss having her in my life. We have a lot of the same dietary restrictions but for different reasons, and she was my food adventure buddy. We would go out for a coffee or lunch to some of the few restaurants and cafes that we can safely eat at. She invited me out for coffee and I went. When we met up the next day we made small talk until the divorce came up. 

She let me know how he was doing, he moved into one of the houses on their property, they have like 60 acres and 4 houses on the property that different family members live in. He hasn‚Äôt really gotten out of bed, she‚Äôs worried about him and wanted us to talk it out. She asked if I was willing to go to couples counseling and told her I‚Äôve been asking for that for about a year and his response was no. I was drowning and he didn‚Äôt want to help fix it but now that I‚Äôve decided to leave is when he wants to work it and I just can‚Äôt. She stayed silent for a while before asking me if I still loved him, I do but I don‚Äôt. I told her I loved who he was but I‚Äôm too full of hurt that I don‚Äôt feel the love anymore. I can‚Äôt keep taking care of him like he‚Äôs my child, I can‚Äôt keep bank rolling our lives alone, I need a partner who is able to support me and I haven‚Äôt felt supported by her son in a long time. We were both crying by the end of our talk and she gave a really big hug before leaving. 

He wanted to talk the next day and he came back to the house to talk. When he came in it was awkward, he wanted to give me a hug when he and I did, he went for a kiss and I turned my head so he kissed my cheek. We talked for a while about our relationship and how it got to this point. He apologized for a lot, he went into specifics of how he never helped around the house, he could‚Äôve done more since he was home. It wasn‚Äôt fair to me that he put it all on me. He told me he‚Äôs looking at a new job, one where he doesn‚Äôt have to travel and it‚Äôs actually in the field he got his degree in. He gave me an update on his cat, who is struggling to the adjustment of the new house. I told him I‚Äôll have papers for him in a few weeks and he couldn‚Äôt look me in the eyes for the rest of the time he was there. I helped him pack some of the odds and ends that he left around the house and he left again. 

At the appointment with the lawyer we talked about what it would look like for the divorce process. Unless he wants the house I plan to buy his half. If I do that then there‚Äôs a good chance I won‚Äôt have to pay alimony unless he fights for it. He has the potential to make more than me so my lawyer doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôll have to pay anyways. We don‚Äôt have children, unless you count fur babies, and I took a pregnancy test recently to confirm that I‚Äôm not pregnant so that won‚Äôt be a factor. We each own our cars and pay for them ourselves. We have a joint savings but I can prove I‚Äôve been the only one contributing for the last 2 years so it‚Äôs likely I‚Äôll get most of that. I‚Äôm not touching it besides for the bills for the house per my lawyers advice. I will hopefully have papers for my soon to be ex to fill out and if he gets a lawyer to look over. 

My 2 cats have been laying in bed with me and haven‚Äôt left my side since he left. They‚Äôre trying to make me feel better but it‚Äôs hard. My friend who is also getting a divorce has said that we‚Äôll have a hot girl summer together and it makes me laugh but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready or even close to it. I don‚Äôt want to meet new people I don‚Äôt want to do first dates again. I think I‚Äôm just going to single for a while. 
                                                               
My mom sent me me this poem after I told them about the divorce and it makes me cry reading it, I‚Äôve learned a lot from this relationship and I‚Äôm content being the old crazy cat lady for the foreseeable future. 

‚ÄúI will never love the same after you.
I was always the girl that loved so hard that it hurt, until it hurt.
I watched you change everyday until you eventually become someone I told myself I would never settle for.
But how do I leave you?
I told myself it was just a rough patch and we can work through this. 
I will do more to make you love me again. 
Because I don‚Äôt give up on people. 
So why would I do that to you?
I will put myself through hell for you, I will hate myself to love you, and I will rip myself apart so that you feel cared for. 
Because I was serious when I said 
I would die for you, because I almost did‚Ä¶
I guess I ripped myself apart so much that I had nothing left. 
I cared so much about you that I stopped caring about myself completely. 
I lost who I was and I was no longer strong. 
And I watched myself change everyday until I eventually became someone I told myself I‚Äôd never be. 
But it‚Äôs my fault for not having a limit on how much I‚Äôm willing to give, 
And for how long I‚Äôm willing to stay. 
And for loving you more than I loved me. 
Because I loved you so hard that it hurt‚Ä¶
So I will never love the same after you‚Äù

Brown was open to anything. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs try that.‚Äù","Two years ago, after a crushing loss in the NBA playoffs, Jaylen Brown walked into Citadel Martial Arts in Boston.

The Boston Celtics star felt as if he had ‚Äúfailed‚Äù when his team needed him in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals that season against the Miami Heat. The disappointment led him to amplify his offseason training and alter his routine. He tried new cardio workouts, such as swimming and various weight training exercises, but none of them satisfied him.

When Brown walked into Citadel Martial Arts, he told Lionel Young, one of the gym‚Äôs instructors, that he was ‚Äúlooking for something that he hasn‚Äôt been able to get elsewhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was looking for the warrior in him,‚Äù Young said.

Young suggested that Brown try out Muay Thai, an ancient combat martial art, also known as ‚Äúthe art of eight limbs‚Äù because fighters deploy punches, kicks, knees and elbows. The explosiveness of the sport demands speed, power, reflexes and intense training ‚Äî all of which Young thought would transfer to the basketball court.

Brown was open to anything. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs try that.‚Äù

Ever since, Muay Thai has remained a priority in Brown‚Äôs life; he even trained in between games during the NBA playoffs this year.

‚ÄúFighters train harder,‚Äù he said in a Men‚Äôs Health video. ‚ÄúBeing able to incorporate that into my mind and my body has been great.‚Äù Brown credits Muay Thai with improving his footwork, mobility and body control. However, he also believes it instilled a mentality and confidence that has trickled into every part of his game.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs such a knowledgeable and kind person,‚Äù Young said. ‚ÄúSo to unlock that violent and aggressive side, that‚Äôs something I think he was looking for.‚Äù

Here at Peak, we like to try things for ourselves. Earlier this year, I attempted Kansas City Royals star Bobby Witt Jr.‚Äôs routine, while my colleague Rustin Dodd was brave enough to drink coffee like Detroit Lions coach Dan Campbell. So when my editor asked if I‚Äôd want to try Muay Thai like Brown, I was excited.

I signed up for my first Muay Thai class and called Young to learn more about what I was getting into.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs addicting,‚Äù he warned me. ‚ÄúBe careful.‚Äù

I‚Äôd tried a few boxing workouts over the years, but as I drove to my first class in the evening, it dawned on me that I had no idea what I was doing.

my dm at our meeting literally compared us to loyal dogs. he said we should be making every customer feel like their loyal dogs greeting them upon entering the home. 

WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? 

the entire meeting was a slap in the face. we are a high volume store with barely enough labor to keep the place stocked between rushes. we are placed on 2-3 partners plays during the middle of the afternoon, which according to the numbers, is just as busy as our regularly scheduled peak. we had one partner bold enough to speak out and say all of this to our dm in the meeting and he literally stopped her, told her they could meet one on one, but that what she was saying wasn't relevant to our meeting. WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHORT STAFFING ISN'T RELEVANT TO A MEETING ABOUT SERVICE OPTIMIZATION? 

they spent the entire meeting telling us we need to use the green apron host position even when it isn't on the play, even when we are on two person plays, even when we are growing. It doesn't fucking matter what we do. It doesn't fucking matter how hard we work. It doesn't fucking matter how much we do to break our backs to meet these new standards. It doesn't matter. WE do not matter. This is a slap in the goddamn face to every single barista that works for this company and we are just expected to get right back up and say ""yes master, whatever you want"" so that we can pay our fucking bills and put gas in our half broken down cars to get to this shitty job. 

""but the benefits"" ""but the pay"" ""but the internal hiring"" but nothing. we are treated less than human. according to my dm, we should behave like loyal dogs. this company is going in the shitter faster than we can scream ""WELCOME TO MY COFFEEHOUSE""  to the customers immediately upon entering the store. I just want to connect with people genuinely, that's why I started barista-ing seven years ago. I have always loved connecting and getting to know people through coffee. Starbucks has ruined that and I am exhausted. so many of us are so exhausted and they just don't care. we are nothing but work cattle to this corporation. and they have us in golden handcuffs, begging for more, because at least we can scrape by with paid rent and free drinks on the clock. it's all so dehumanizing. I just want to connect with people and make their day with good bevs and conversation but we are too busy and too short staffed to accomplish all of this without sacrificing times and quality. I just wish corporate would listen to those of us in the battle grounds. this is all tone deaf. this is all so disconnected. this is all so demeaning. and this meeting was exactly what I anticipated: more corporate bullshit with empty promises and zero sustainability.

i don't expect everyone to be as crazy about being punctual as i am, but it seems that 9 times out of ten, a date will text me about 30 mins before the actual real go-time that they're going to be late, for such and such reason. it didn't bother me the first couple times, because hey, stuff gets in the way, but it's been so consistent that it's starting to feel like maybe i'm missing something, or doing something wrong.

to clarify, i'm not talking about being five minutes late, because traffic was bad-- that barely shows up on my radar. i've had multiple dates in a row say they're going to be late, and have me sitting looking dumb in a coffee shop for a full hour, sometimes even two (i know it probably sounds sad to wait around for two hours, but i didn't know what else to do in that situation). i‚Äôve noticed that my dates, regardless of gender identity, does not seem especially apologetic about their tardiness‚Äî not that i demand apology, but they kind of just act like this is typical, expected behavior. 

i can‚Äôt help but feel like a low priority when this happens, and it sours the dates for me. is it me? or is this common in the dating scene? how do i stop this from happening to me in the future? how do i communicate that tardiness is a dealbreaker for me without sounding like a control freak?

I‚Äôm saying ‚Äúlose weight again‚Äù because I previously lost weight using a slimming coffee that I drank every morning. It worked by suppressing my appetite, and I did go from 56 kg down to 49 kg. However, it made me dizzy and triggered acidity, so I had to stop it for health reasons.

Now I‚Äôve started gaining weight again quite rapidly, and I‚Äôd really appreciate any safe and effective tips‚Äîespecially post-surgery. What can I do to manage my weight this time in a healthier way?

I‚Äôll be in FNQ next month and planning a full-day self-drive from¬†**Port Douglas to Cairns**, looping through the¬†**Tablelands**.

Here‚Äôs the rough plan I‚Äôve come up with‚Äîcurious if anyone has feedback, better route ideas, or hidden gems:

* Drive up¬†**Mossman Mount Molloy Road**¬†‚Üí¬†**Julatten**¬†(I hear there‚Äôs a great lookout with views over the coast).
* Stop in¬†**Julatten**¬†or¬†**Mount Molloy**¬†for a quick coffee/stretch‚Äîapparently the scenery here (woodland, pasture, rainforest) is really different from the coast.
* Continue to¬†**Mareeba**, maybe with a side detour to¬†**Big Mitchell Creek Reservoir**.
* If weather and road conditions allow, detour to¬†**Davies Creek National Park**‚ÄîI‚Äôve heard the waterfalls and dry open forest are worth the drive (how are the unsealed roads in August?).
* Loop back towards¬†**Kuranda**¬†and stop at¬†**Barron Falls**¬†and do one of the nearby rainforest trails.

**If I‚Äôve still got energy:**

* Continue south to¬†**Lake Eacham**¬†or¬†**Lake Barrine**¬†(love short walks around crater lakes).
* Check out¬†**Cathedral Fig Tree**
* Maybe spot platypus in¬†**Yungaburra**, or do a quick visit to¬†**Hastie‚Äôs Swamp**
* (Malanda Falls / Bromfield Swamp sound cool too, but might be a stretch?)

Does this loop make sense for a single day in mid-August? Are any of the roads sketchy in dry season, or things I should be aware of? Any local tips for wildlife spotting or especially scenic stops are massively appreciated.

Also, english is not my first language.

I'm in my late thirties now, and my HH started when I was around 18.  
It started in my armpits.. I noticed that I started to sweat much more easily than my friends in the summer, but it was 'just' the armpits.  
I will not waste your time with a long timeline of how it evolved, but fast forward to me being in my late thirties now, it is now especially my back and face.  
I live less than 1,5 kilometers (less than 1 mile) from my job and I take my bike to work, and no matter what time of year it is, I have to arrive 30 minutes before my shift starts, because I have to take off all my clothes when I arrive, and just sit there in the locker room, sweating and steaming, before I put on my work clothes.  
I'm still moist and feel disgusting when I put on my work clothes, but it's a little less than if I arrive 5 minutes before my shift starts.  
Antiperspirants are not an option, as my most severe area is my back and face, but make no mistake, I sweat all over my body.

The most relief I have found, is from Glyco. If I take 4 mg. on an empty stomach, and don't eat anything for 2 hours, I do get a gigantic relief for about 5-6 hours.  
The problem is that I'm also on Vyvanse because of my ADD, and with Vyvanse I get a much longer og better effect if I eat something with fats and protein, 30 minutes after I take the dose.  
So when I have to be at work at 6 in the morning, I wake up at 4 to take my Vyvanse and Glyco, and one medication calls for not eating for the next 2 hours, and the other works much better if I eat shortly after.  
Also, both medications contributes to cotton mouth, and therefore I'm now much more prone to cavities in my teeth.   


I haven't heard of a glyco prescription in my country (I'm in scandinavia), so I have to buy it online from an online pharmacy, and it's so f\*\*\*ing expensive.. And on top of that, I have to pay Value Added Tax when it arrives in my country, which is even more money.  
And all of this I'm doing, is just to function almost like a normal human being.

It's so lonely to be a work in the summertime, and look around at your colleagues that arrive 5 minutes before the shift starts, sitting there drinking coffee og laughing, without a sweat stain anywhere.  
Meanwhile I'm a medicated mess, that has to avoid the caffeine because of my sweat glands (even though I love coffee), and have to take so many measures, all day, every day.

Sorry for just rambling and venting, but I can't get this off my chest anywhere else.  
To all other sufferers in this sub: Trust me, I know the struggle.

But first, let‚Äôs have a look at what this post will cover.

# BASICS Of Amazon PPC

Let us get acquainted with the basics for understanding a PPC Campaign.

# What is Amazon PPC?

Amazon PPC is an attention-grabbing and powerful marketing platform sponsored by Amazon itself. It allows professional sellers to run advertising campaigns by indexing keywords to their product listings for increased visibility ‚Äî either in search results or on a competitor‚Äôs product page. If you do everything correctly, it also helps achieve higher organic rankings.

In simple terms, Amazon PPC (Pay-Per-Click) is an advertising service that enables you to run sponsored product ads so your listings can show up on page one search results using specific keywords. As the name suggests, you only pay when a consumer clicks on your advertisement.

When you receive orders through the keywords used in your¬†[PPC campaign](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service), Amazon begins to index those keywords to your product. Over time, this improves your organic keyword ranking, meaning PPC not only drives sales ‚Äî it helps you grow sustainably.

On a side note, PPC can be best utilized when your listing already has a few numbers of reviews.

# 

When you receive orders through the keywords used in your PPC campaign, Amazon begins to index those keywords to your product. Over time, this improves your organic keyword ranking, meaning PPC not only drives sales ‚Äî it helps you grow sustainably.

Pro Tip: Many sellers partner with an expert¬†[**Amazon PPC agency**](https://amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service)¬†to structure campaigns strategically, manage keyword bidding, and optimize performance ‚Äî especially in competitive niches.

Whether you‚Äôre managing this yourself or utilizing professional¬†[**Amazon PPC services**](https://amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service), the goal is the same: to boost product visibility, increase conversions, and ultimately dominate organic rankings once you‚Äôve built up enough momentum through ads.

On a side note,¬†[**Amazon PPC**](https://amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service)¬†can be best utilized when your listing already has¬†**a few solid reviews**¬†‚Äî this builds trust and makes your ad clicks more likely to convert into sales.

# How Does Amazon PPC Work?

The concept behind Amazon PPC Ads isn‚Äôt as complicated as it sounds. Here is a quick review of what shows up on Amazon when millions of buyers hit enter with various searches each month. Buyers type either small search terms or, most frequently, a string of words entered to get specific results.

The longer string of keywords is called¬†[long-tail keywords](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-ranking), otherwise just keywords. Once they hit enter, Amazon‚Äôs algorithm stirs into motion and retrieves a list of search results that match the search term as specifically as possible.

The products you see in the results will have one of two sources or reasons to be there: Organic or Paid.¬†[Amazon PPC](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service), as discussed above, deals with paid sponsored products. Both types of results have a place at the top. However, paid results may appear more than once on the page.

They can appear above organic results, between them, on either side, or even below a product‚Äôs organic listing on its selling page. Sponsored ads, their types, and their positioning will be discussed shortly. For now, let‚Äôs focus on the mechanism.

Amazon PPC functions on the basis of an enhanced auction-based approach. Vendors and sellers bid on keywords that buyers are likely to use to search for products. A daily budget is set for each keyword. The method of keyword selection is entirely up to you.

You can either let Amazon fetch relevant keywords based on your listing or enter them manually. The chances of your ad displaying increase as you bid higher, just like any auction. The lower your bids, the lower the chances your ad will show. You can always adjust your keyword bids throughout the campaign based on the profits they generate. Every time your ad is clicked, you pay for it.

# Places Where You Can Target Your Brand PPC Ad

You‚Äôve seen ads on Amazon featuring arrays of products and brands. They appear in different places and formats, as mentioned above. Amazon offers three main types of ads for targeting your advertisements: Sponsored Products, Sponsored Brand, and Display Ads. Each ad type has different positioning, costs, conversion rates, and click-through rates (CTR).

Before choosing which type to go for, keep in mind your product type, target audience, and objectives. All three ad types serve specific purposes:

* **Sponsored Products Ads**¬†are best for targeting shoppers with purchase intent.
* **Sponsored Brand Ads**¬†are excellent for promoting brand awareness and image.
* **Product Display Ads**¬†serve both product promotion and audience targeting.

**Sponsored Products Ads ‚Äì**¬†Sponsored Products Ads are very effective in increasing CTR and conversion rates because they blend seamlessly among organic results ‚Äî right on page one, at the top, and between listings ‚Äî where about 45% of buyers purchase from. If you don‚Äôt read the ‚Äúsponsored‚Äù label carefully, you might mistake these for organic results. These ads can also appear below organic results, on the sides, or on product detail pages.

They integrate so naturally into the search results that it‚Äôs almost impossible to miss them. It‚Äôs crucial to perform deep keyword research so your ads can mimic organic results flawlessly. Once you allocate bids on carefully selected keywords, Amazon decides when and where to display your ad to reach the right audience. Sponsored Products Ads are not only effective but also roughly 3x cheaper than Google AdWords.

**Product Display Ads ‚Äì**¬†When you visit a product page, you may notice ads in the ‚Äúsimilar products‚Äù section. For customers, it offers additional options; for sellers, it provides insights into customer behavior and needs. Product Display Ads contain products similar to the one occupying the page organically and are paired with its ASIN. They target specific audiences, categories, interests, and related listings.

**Sponsored Brand Ads ‚Äì**¬†Sponsored Brand Ads appear at the very top of search results, featuring brand logos and customized messages to promote brand image or awareness. Their prime placement makes them nearly impossible to miss. Though visibility is limited to certain product categories, these ads offer the widest range of customization options for sellers.

You have the option to display your banner in the way that is most favorable to you. Pick out your own images or text to display. Banner ads allow you to display your products collectively so the customer gets a bigger impression and more choices from your brand.

Here are some important PPC terms you should familiarize yourself with.

**Impressions ‚Äì**¬†An impression is when a PPC ad is viewed by the consumer.

# Prerequisites Of Running The Best PPC

Running a successful PPC campaign is not about how much money you can throw on Amazon sponsored ads and just hope for the best. It requires serious effort, proper attention, and of course certain prerequisites without which you don‚Äôt stand a chance.

There are simply two conditions you must meet before you rely on¬†[**Amazon PPC Services**](https://amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service)¬†to rocket your sales.

# Attractive Listing

It won‚Äôt matter a dime if you spend hundreds on the promotion of your product but fail to make a quality listing. One disappointing look at a sad state of a picture, overly complicated title or poor content can discourage your potential buyer to slip back into the cracks. If you are spending money to promote something, it is obvious that it needs to be worthy, else why would the visitor turn into a customer? A strong impression needs to be made so your campaign can actually turn clicks into sales.

# High Demanding And Relevant Keywords

You need keywords that would drive most traffic and sales to your listing. If you are using keywords that have fallen behind or have no relevance to your product, your listing will not appear or be visible to consumers when they search for that same product, hence rendering your¬†[**Amazon PPC Services**](https://amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service)¬†useless.

If you want to maximize results, consider hiring an¬†[**Amazon PPC Agency**](https://amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service)¬†that specializes in optimizing your campaigns for better ROI.

# How To Find The Right Keywords For My PPC Campaign?

Modern problems require modern solutions. Keyword research is a crucial step in building a strong and effective listing. This is why I will recommend that you should take assistance from some of the up-to-date, fast, and reliable keyword tools.

Keyword tools not only list down but offer various mechanisms by which you can sort out the keyword lists of your own choice. You may extract competitor keywords or keywords of your own and then proceed to filter out keywords that have high search volumes, top organic rankings, or most sales. In other words, you have to make three keyword lists that will sort the category of Keywords that are Highly Relevant, Medium Relevant and Low Relevant for your¬†[**Amazon PPC Services**](https://amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service)¬†campaign.

If you wish to read more on keyword research, check out our blog on Tips for¬†[Amazon Keyword Research](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-ranking).

**Difference Between Automatic And Manual Targeting**

When you start an ad campaign, Amazon charges you with the decision to either pick automatic targeting or manual targeting of keywords. If you opt for automatic targeting, Amazon will target ads to all relevant customer searches using your product‚Äôs information including its category, related products, and keywords that you have used in your listing.

On the other hand, if you go with manual targeting, you can manually select all the keywords you would like to bid on, choosing different match types for keywords. You control everything now, but it requires constant monitoring. Some keywords will go on to have low relevancy and if they are not driving traffic to your sale, you can lower your bid on it to effectively manage your campaign.

This step is crucial whether you manage your ads yourself or work with an¬†[**Amazon PPC Agency**](https://amzonestep.com/services/amazon-ppc-service)¬†to optimize your campaigns.

# Understanding Types Of Keywords

# Broad Match Keyword

Broad match scoops up everything there is related to your indexed keywords which means that your ad will show up when Amazon shopper types in anything related to your keywords. Let‚Äôs suppose you are selling coffee mugs. If you include the keyword ‚Äúcoffee mug‚Äù in your ad campaign, then your ad may come up if the customer types in ‚Äúmug coffee,‚Äù ‚Äúdiner mug,‚Äù ‚Äúcoffee cup,‚Äù or even a synonym like ‚Äúhot liquid cup,‚Äù or a misspelling like, ‚Äúcoffee mug.‚Äù Resulting in a broad result.

# Phrase Match Keywords

Phrase Match is concerned with long-tail keywords. A longtail keyword is a keyword that is three words or longer, or at least very specific. Whenever a customer uses a highly specific search phrase, they usually already know exactly what they want to buy and therefore long-tail keywords tend to have a higher conversion rate (they result in more purchases) even though their monthly search volume is less (they are searched fewer times in a month).

Phrase match will strip out linking words but keeps the sequence of your keyword. For example, if your keyword phrase is ‚Äúgreen coffee mugs for women,‚Äù then a customer can search ‚Äúgreen coffee mugs women‚Äù and your listing will show up on the search results page. This is because ‚Äúfor‚Äù is a linking word, and phrase matches ignore those words. However, if the customer searched ‚Äúcoffee mugs green for women‚Äù then your listing will not show up on the results page because the sequence of your keyword was changed.

Prepositions, articles, and conjunctions like and, a, of the, in, out, for, and on would be considered linking words.

# Exact Match Keywords

Exact match keywords are exactly as the name suggests: the customer‚Äôs search term must match your keyword exactly in order for your ad to populate on the search results page. For example, if your keyword is ‚Äúgreen coffee mugs with a cartoon,‚Äù and your customer types in ‚Äúgreen coffee mugs cartoon,‚Äù then your ad will not show up.

Be very careful when using an exact match, because one little misspell or a keyword not thoroughly planned well could result in no one typing in your exact keywords phrase and your ad will accomplish nothing.

For the same reason, when dropping in negative keywords that you do not want pulling up your ad, make sure you use an exact match, otherwise, you could be ruling out similar keywords that you want to trigger your ad.

# Why Should You Go For Amazon PPC?

There are multiple ways to achieve sales, PPC still stands to be one of the best and most effective methods. Here are a few reasons why.

There are many companies that claim to extract the Amazon data using the high to low search volume feature, etc. but in reality, PPC is the only platform through which you can get the most accurate data. PPC stands on Amazon‚Äôs very own ground, so there is no doubt that any data you use from PPC in favor of your advertising campaign, will provide the most reliable and trustworthy results.

PPC allows you to target a highly specific audience which means more control to you over who gets to see your message. Targeting the exact demographics like age, location, etc. It centers a strategic play based on what your audience wants to see.

PPC delivers faster results because amazon sponsored ads are right on the Amazon website. Buyers come straight to Amazon when they need to purchase something, having ads next to the purchasing platform makes sales rate naturally higher. Not only does it drives the sales but it also helps with branding and visibility.

# Intermediate

If you are already familiar with the¬†[Amazon PPC basics](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how_to_do_amazon_ppc_optimization/), let us move on to other pressing matters. Even when you have sufficient information, sometimes you encounter certain mind-boggling situations which can cause a hindrance in running a successful amazon business.

Below I‚Äôll explore all situations which may be the reasons you might be experiencing difficulty with¬†[Amazon PPC](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-amazon-ppc-strategies-for-maximizing-your-advertising-roi/).

# What To Do When:

# 1. When You Have Impressions But No Clicks

If your PPC campaigns are making customer impressions but you are still not getting any clicks you must be wondering what is it that you are doing wrong. There are a couple of reasons why this mishap may be occurring. Any of the reasons or together they could be preventing clicks.

Let‚Äôs begin with a keyword bidding that‚Äôs too low. Say, Amazon recommends a keyword‚Äôs bid $2 but you go cheap and bid 0.55 cents. This will likely result in the listing to appear on the back pages, where even if someone gets an impression, they won‚Äôt click it because they want the best of the best, that is page one products.

Next up, you have to take the relevancy of the products into consideration. If you have indexed keywords with low relevancy it is pretty simple that people will have lower chances of making a search by that keyword. For example, your product ‚Äògreen coffee mugs‚Äô is indexed with a low relevant keyword such as ‚Äòcups‚Äô. Now first-page search results may not necessarily list all cups/mugs in green color as your keyword says.

To determine¬†**keyword relevancy**¬†here‚Äôs a quick guide.

It could also be that your listing is present in an irrelevant category or perhaps an incorrect subcategory. For example, you have listed your product ‚ÄòGreen Coffee Mugs‚Äô in the category of Kindle store or Electronics, where this product has absolutely no business being. A customer is not going to search or find this product in the relevant areas. Similarly, even with the right category ‚ÄòHome and Kitchen‚Äô, you can mistakenly end up with a wrong subcategory such as ‚Äòbedding‚Äô instead of ‚Äòkitchen and dining‚Äô.

Sometimes sellers make an error with keyword usage in the title of their listing. The Exact and Phrase Match Keywords in your campaign may not be written in the exact order as in the title of your listing. To review the issue with an example, your product says ‚ÄòGreen Coffee Mugs‚Äô in the title but your exact keyword indexed is ‚ÄòCoffee Mugs‚Äô or your phrase match keyword says ‚Äò Green New Coffee Mugs‚Äô.

Having low search volume keywords in your listing could be another reason why your listing is getting impressons but still no clicks. The fewer people are searching using your keyword, the fewer chances of impressions and even less of getting clicks because once again your product might have been pushed back from page 1 where most of the sales occur.

You have to be vigilant of every little detail you enter about your product. It could change the entire game.

# 2. When You Have Clicks But No Sales

This might seem more puzzling than it actually is. When you are apparently doing everything right and even receiving clicks but still are not getting any sales, it could mean one of two things. Either your listing isn‚Äôt good enough or it is not differentiated enough.

Potential buyers may click on your listing but they could be immediately discouraged because your listing wasn‚Äôt attractive enough. Make sure to create a listing that has not only sufficient information but also a certain appeal to buyers‚Äô lifestyles. Give shoppers a reason to buy your product over the competitors.

Include quality content, attractive images, and solid selling points. You have to make them stick long enough to agree with your offers, so they may actually buy instead of discarding it.

Sometimes, even when you have an attractive listing you don‚Äôt get sales because your product is drowning among the masses. It needs to stand out, in simple terms. Little things such as the main image could change the outcome of the sales. A listing that exclusively offers something others don‚Äôt will surely stand out and drive more sales.

# 3. When Your ACOS Is Too High

# 

Your advertising cost of sale ideally should be less than your profit margin. If your ACOS is coming up to 10-20% it‚Äôs a good spend. Otherwise, it proves a more damaging result than your amount to actual sales. In the case, you are struggling with a high ACOS, here might be a few reasons to ponder through.

Your ACOS status depends on the stage you are in when launching a product. If you have just launched your product, say within 10-30 days, the ACoS should not be your concern right now. It‚Äôs too early to be worrying about ACOS being high because that‚Äôs just how it goes in the early stages. Once you‚Äôve crossed that duration, its time to closely monitor it.

A sensible strategy is to lower your bids on low to medium relevant keywords as they may be costing you a lot of money for a very low return. If a keyword isn‚Äôt driving sales as much it should be, there is no point in pouring excessive money after it. Go for the suggested bid or lower it yourself as you might see fit.

Make sure that you have selected the correct match type for your keywords. Irrelevant selection of keyword match type can result in high¬†**ACOS**¬†because your product is being advertised in the wrong or irrelevant areas where no one is supposed to be looking or buying your product. It is kind of a waste that may slip by unnoticed. Keeping a close eye on where and how your money is spent is a start to managing effective ACOS.

# CTR Scale (Click-Through-Rate)

A 0.7-1% CTR is minimum  
1-2% CTR is good  
2-5% CTR is excellent  
5%+ CTR is exceptional.

This is a general guideline and may change with the category you are selling in.

# When Can You Stop Pushing PPC And Start Relying On Organic Sales?

Shutting off a PPC Campaign is not recommended even when you have achieved high organic rankings, but rather it is suggested that we simply lower the bids. Being in the top 10 search results is a good indication that your product is doing well and you can start lowering your PPC expenses. But being in the list of top 5 is the ideal state. Again, this depends on the market for your product category.

Although you are now on the first half of page one results, PPC is still favorable to you in terms of keeping you updated about newer and highly relevant keywords that buyers are using to make purchases. Keeping a PPC campaign running, is always a good idea because it grants you not only top but double visibility on page one. The more exposure of your product on the Amazon website, the better.

# Expert

# Latest PPC Strategies ‚Äì 3 Types Of Bidding

# Dynamic bids ( Down Only)

The strategy is to opt for a setting in your PPC campaign where you only go down on the bids. Lowering your bids in real-time when your PPC ad may have fewer chances of converting sales. Once you have selected this option, there is no raising it back up again, it only goes down.

# Dynamic Bids (Up and Down)

This strategy is concerned with a dynamic setting. Either you raise your bids (by a maximum of 100%) in real-time when your keyword may be likely to convert to a sale or lower your bids when your keyword is less likely to convert sales. It depends on the situation of your campaign, which strategy you should go for.

# Fixed Bids

As the name suggests, your exact bids and any manual adjustments you set remains throughout the campaign, and it will not readjust your bids based on the likelihood of a sale, as it would in the above-mentioned strategies.

My wife and I are doing our first big move and are renting a 26ft Penske truck to do so. We will be having movers come and pack but want a quick check to see if this stuff should fit and how much leftover room yall think there may be. We are moving out of a 4 bedroom house but only really used two rooms for bedrooms the other two were offices. We had two outdoor spaces and two living room spaces which I think will be the most of the bulky furniture. I‚Äôm only listing the big items here and then would like a gauge between ‚Äúyou‚Äôll have a lot of room for boxes and stuff‚Äù and ‚Äúthis will barely fit as is‚Äù to see how potentially screwed I am. I think the movers will want to load these big furniture items in first. Thanks in advance!
