1gq7t0y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gq7t0y,One bittersweet thing I noticed about the recent chapter,"Both in the flashbacks, and Denji's monologue to Asa, there is no mention of his time as Chainsaw Man, doing Chainsaw Man things. Just the normal moments, like chilling with Aki and Power in the winter weather, sharing coffee with Reze, and walking the cats and dogs with Nayuta. Contrast this to all the times he keeps saying ""I want to be Chainsaw Man"" instead in the previous chapters.

While it has been hinted in previous chapters, this chapter now make it really clear, that if Denji really had to give up one thing in response to Yoshida and Barem's question, he would ultimately choose to give up being Chainsaw Man, choosing a normal life over being Chainsaw Man. 

And Denji only realised this far too late, after he had gone through so much loss, after believing he wanted the latter for so, so long. He had forgotten, that being Chainsaw Man was only meant to be a stepping stone to living a normal life. It wasn't a goal in itself, but the means.

My partner and I work at the same company. We’ve been together for about nine months. My birthday was on October 20. On the evening of October 18, she called me and said her manager had called her, insisting that we both had to go to work the next day. It was a Saturday, and normally, we’re off on weekends. Even though I was tired and suggested she go alone, she somehow convinced me, and we set off for work on Saturday morning.

However, it turns out we weren’t going to work at all. :) Instead, we went to a beautiful spot on the side of a high mountain, two hours away from the city where we live, and had a lovely breakfast together. Everything was perfect. By noon, we had finished our breakfast, and she told me that we had no further plans, asking what I would like to do. I suggested visiting a nearby lake, which was about a 25-minute drive away.

We took romantic walks around the lake, drank coffee, and took lots of photos. Then she mentioned knowing another nice place nearby. So we set off for that spot, climbing further up the mountain. All around were only villas.

At one point, she said she really needed to use the restroom, stopped the car, and went to knock on the door of one of the houses. When the door opened, there were our friends waiting for me with a birthday cake in their hands. I was in shock and speechless. I had never experienced so many surprises in one day. I truly felt loved, and that day and the days following were perfect. It’s something I’ll never forget.

However, last Sunday night, on November 10, I received a long message from my partner. She said she was feeling mentally unwell, experiencing a void within herself, that she didn’t want to keep hurting me or herself, and that she wanted to end the relationship.

I was stunned, as if struck by lightning. I couldn’t find a rational answer. She doesn’t want to talk, and I’ve decided not to reach out for at least a few weeks.

Since my birthday, we hadn’t had any major arguments or disagreements. I still can’t make sense of what happened. Dear Reddit strangers, what do you think? Thank you.",1,1731483636.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

No wonder men are afraid to actually attempt conversation with women! The end result is that everyone just ends up lonely.  It was probably a blessing in disguise because nobody wants to deal with that kind of grief when trying to find a partner.  
I wonder what's going on in her life to make her automatically think we're all just greasy slobbering oafs rather than having a conversation and finding out if the idiot might actually be a nice bloke, holding down a stable job and looking to have a chat with someone of the opposite sex.

The sun is setting, casting golden hues across the landscape, and the campfire is crackling invitingly. What could make this moment even more perfect? A comfortable rocking chair to gently sway in while taking in nature's beauty.

I still vividly remember my first camping trip with a proper rocking chair. It was during a week-long adventure in Yellowstone National Park, where every evening became a cherished ritual of watching wildlife from my GCI Freestyle Rocker. One particular evening, a family of elk wandered within viewing distance while I quietly rocked and sipped my coffee. That moment transformed my entire approach to camping comfort. 🌅

# The Rise of Camping Rocking Chairs 📈

# Market Growth and Consumer Trends

The camping industry has witnessed a remarkable transformation in recent years. The days of sacrificing comfort for outdoor adventure are behind us, and nowhere is this more evident than in the camping chair market. With projected growth to reach USD 197.86 million by 2031 and a steady CAGR of 6.40%, it's clear that campers are investing in their comfort like never before.

*Personal observation*: Over my 15 years of camping, I've watched the evolution from basic folding chairs to sophisticated rocking designs. The difference is night and day!

# Key Features to Consider 🔍

# Comfort and Fit

When it comes to choosing the perfect camping rocking chair, comfort is king. Here's what I've learned through countless camping trips:

**Height Considerations:**

* *Low chairs* (13-15 inches): Perfect for low tables and intimate campfire settings
* *Standard height* (16-19 inches): Ideal for most campers
* *Tall chairs* (20+ inches): Better for those with mobility issues or taller campers

**Seat Width and Depth:**

* Wider seats (20+ inches) provide more stability while rocking
* Deeper seats offer better support but may be challenging for shorter individuals

*Personal Experience*: As a 6'2"" camper, I initially bought a low-profile chair because it looked cool. Big mistake! After an evening of awkward positioning, I switched to a standard-height model and never looked back.

# Rocking Mechanism Types

# 1. Fixed Rocker Bottoms

* Traditional arc-shaped design
* Best on flat surfaces
* Most durable option
* *Personal note*: Great for established campgrounds with level sites

# 2. Spring-Rocker Functions

* Smoother rocking motion
* Better stability on uneven terrain
* More complex mechanism
* *Real experience*: These saved my relaxation time during a rocky mountain camping trip

# 3. Swing Functions

* Gentler movement
* Usually more compact
* Often lighter weight
* *Field tested*: Perfect for family camping as they're safer for kids

# Portability and Storage 🎒

**Weight Considerations:**

* Ultralight: 2-5 lbs
* Standard: 6-12 lbs
* Heavy-duty: 13+ lbs

**Storage Features:**

* Carry bags with shoulder straps
* Quick-fold mechanisms
* Compact storage dimensions

*Pro tip*: After struggling with a bulky chair in my Honda CR-V, I've learned to prioritize chairs that fold flat over those with awkward cylindrical carry cases.

# Top Picks for 2024 🏆

# 1. GCI Freestyle Rocker

**The Premium Choice** Price Range: $50-$70

My go-to chair for the past two years. Here's why I love it:

* Spring-action rocking is smooth as butter
* Powder-coated frame resists rust
* Built-in carry handle
* Side pocket perfect for phones and small items

*Real-world testing*: This chair has survived 47 camping trips, 3 music festivals, and countless backyard BBQs. The springs still work perfectly!

# 2. Helinox Chair One + Rocking Runners

**The Backpacker's Dream** Price Range: $100-$150

Perfect for those who hike to their camping spots:

* Incredibly lightweight at just 2 lbs
* Packs down smaller than a water bottle
* Surprisingly sturdy construction
* Removable runners for versatility

*Personal adventure*: Carried this on a 15-mile backcountry trek in the Rockies. The extra weight was worth every ounce for comfortable evenings at camp.

# 3. Roll Your Own Way Rocker

**The Comfort King** Price Range: $80-$120

For those prioritizing comfort above all:

* Extra-wide seat design
* Padded headrest
* Bungee suspension system
* Cup holder and side table included

*Honest review*: It's like bringing your living room recliner to the wilderness. Not the most portable, but unbeatable for car camping.

# 4. Ozark Trail Outdoor Tension Camp Chair

**The Budget Hero** Price Range: Under $50

Proof that good quality doesn't always mean expensive:

* Removable rocking mechanism
* Durable steel frame
* Includes carry bag
* Weather-resistant fabric

1gq7is0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WoodworkingGuild/comments/1gq7is0/best_wood_glue_everything_you_need_to_know_with/,Best Wood Glue - Everything You Need to Know (With Real Testing & Experience),"After spending 8+ years in woodworking and making every glue-related mistake possible, I'm finally ready to share my comprehensive guide to wood glue. This isn't just theory - every recommendation comes from personal experience, including some spectacular failures that taught me the hard way.

Last summer's garden bench disaster (more on that later) prompted me to do extensive testing and research. I've literally spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars testing different glues in various conditions. Here's everything I've learned.

# The Science Behind Wood Glue 🧪

Before diving into specific types, let's understand how wood glue actually works. Wood glue creates bonds at a molecular level, penetrating the wood fibers to create what's called a ""mechanical bond."" In many cases, a proper glue joint is actually stronger than the wood itself.

# Understanding Wood Glue Types: A Deep Dive

# 1. PVA (Polyvinyl Acetate) Glues

**Types and Characteristics:**

|Type|Water Resistance|Initial Tack|Full Cure Time|Best Use Case|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Type I|Low|Medium|24 hours|Indoor furniture|
|Type II|Medium|High|24 hours|Humid environments|
|Type III|High|Very High|24-48 hours|Outdoor projects|

*Personal Experience:* I used Type I PVA on an outdoor project once - that garden bench I mentioned. After three months of Pacific Northwest weather, the joints failed spectacularly during a family gathering. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but my pride took a serious hit!

# 2. Polyurethane Glues

These are my go-to for any outdoor or water-exposed projects now. They work differently from PVA glues:

* React with moisture to cure
* Expand during curing (usually 3-4 times original volume)
* Create incredibly strong, waterproof bonds

**Pro Tip:** *Always wear gloves with polyurethane glues. I once spent three days with brown hands because I thought I could be careful. Narrator: I couldn't.*

# 3. CA (Cyanoacrylate) Glues

My testing revealed some interesting facts about CA glues:

|Viscosity|Cure Time|Gap Filling|Best Application|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Thin|10-30 sec|Poor|Small repairs|
|Medium|30-60 sec|Good|General use|
|Thick|60-120 sec|Excellent|Large gaps|

# Real-World Testing Results 🔬

I conducted extensive testing on common glue types. Here are the results:

# Shear Strength Test Results

|Glue Type|PSI Rating|Time to Failure|Cost per Oz|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Titebond III|4,000|\>72 hours|$0.85|
|Gorilla Wood|3,600|65 hours|$1.20|
|Hide Glue|3,200|48 hours|$2.50|

Let me tell you about that garden bench - it's become something of a legend in my local woodworking circle.

**The Setup:**

* 8-foot bench made from white oak
* Traditional mortise and tenon joints
* Initially used Titebond I (facepalm)
* Built during summer 2023

**The Failure:** Day 89: During a family BBQ, we heard creaking. Day 90: Complete joint failure during morning coffee. Lesson learned: $400 in materials and 40 hours of work wasted because I saved $8 on glue.

# Advanced Gluing Techniques I've Learned 📚

# Temperature Effects

After extensive testing, I found optimal temperature ranges for different glues:

|Glue Type|Optimal Temp Range|Minimum Working Temp|Maximum Working Temp|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PVA|55°F - 75°F|50°F|80°F|
|Polyurethane|40°F - 90°F|35°F|95°F|
|Hide Glue|70°F - 85°F|65°F|90°F|
|CA|60°F - 80°F|55°F|85°F|

# Moisture Content Matters 💧

I've tested dozens of samples with different moisture contents:

* **Optimal range:** 6-12% moisture content
* **Too dry (<6%):** Poor penetration
* **Too wet (>12%):** Weakened bonds

# Real Project Examples 🏗️

# 1. Heirloom Rocking Chair Restoration

**Project Details:**

* 150-year-old cherry rocking chair
* Multiple loose joints
* Previous repairs with modern glue

**Solution:** Used traditional hide glue for:

* Historical accuracy
* Reversibility
* Better creep resistance

**Result:** Chair has been solid for 2+ years now.

# 2. Custom Kitchen Cabinets

**Project Specs:**

* 15 upper cabinets
* 12 lower cabinets
* High humidity environment

**Glue Choice:** Titebond III

* Used 2 gallons
* 300+ joints
* Zero failures after 18 months

# Common Mistakes (A Comprehensive List) ⚠️

1. **Inadequate Surface Preparation**
   * *Always* do a dry fit
   * Clean old glue completely
   * Test moisture content
2. **Improper Clamping**
   * Too much pressure
   * Uneven pressure
   * Insufficient time
3. **Temperature Issues**
   * Working in cold garage
   * Storing glue improperly
   * Not accounting for seasonal changes

# Advanced Tips for Specific Situations 🔧

# Marine Applications

After building three boats (and sinking one), I've learned:

* Epoxy isn't always the answer
* Two-part polyurethanes excel here
* Regular testing is crucial

# Fine Furniture

For high-end pieces:

* Hide glue for traditional methods
* Liquid hide glue for convenience
* PVA for modern construction

# Long-Term Testing Results 📊

I've maintained a test board exposed to elements for 2 years:

|Glue Type|6 Months|1 Year|2 Years|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Titebond III|Excellent|Excellent|Good|
|Gorilla|Excellent|Good|Fair|
|Epoxy|Excellent|Excellent|Excellent|
|PVA|Good|Poor|Failed|

# Conclusion and Future Developments 🎯

After all this testing and real-world experience, here's what I've concluded:

1. **No perfect glue exists** \- just right glues for specific applications
2. **Investment in quality pays off** \- especially in terms of long-term durability
3. **Testing is crucial** \- never trust theory over practice

# Final Thoughts 💭

Remember: The best glue is the one that matches your:

* Project requirements
* Working conditions
* Skill level
* Long-term durability needs

*Edit 1: Thanks for all the amazing feedback! I'm working on a follow-up post about specialty glues.*

*Edit 2: Several people asked about my testing methodology - I'll post details in the comments.*

*Edit 3: Wow, my first Reddit Gold! Thanks kind stranger!* 🏆

Right now, I‘m considering the 1zpresso K-Ultra and Comandante C40 as contenders with a tendency towards the K-Ultra as I like the external adjustment and magnetic catch cup, next to the flavor profile described in reviews.

For those who just want a summary:
- They both agreed to end the podcast before she went overseas
- Dom wanted to do a final episode to explain but Ella changed her mind and said she didn't want to and that their comment saying they were ending it was enough. Dom regrets not explaining it and giving  closure to the audience
- End of friendship started with the backlash from the Jack and Tori episode because they wanted to handle it differently. She wanted to deal with it head on and say something straight away but Ella wanted to say nothing and so did their podcast management
- Dom copped most of the brunt of the Jack and Tori episode potentially because shes more outspoken. Felt during the episode Ella barely spoke which made her feel like she had to step up and was potentially strategic by Ella
- Dom lost all income and brands put working with her on hold or pulled out completely. None of Ella's deals broke down so in her eyes nothing needed to be said and wasnt empathetic even though she knew about Dom's breakup and that she was mentally barely hanging on
- Felt on reflection the friendship wasnt genuine. Ella would say Dom was away or taking time off when she was actually in a mental health facility treating her mental health which made Dom feel shunned and that she was trying to distance herself from Dom. Felt when she got out Ella saw her as a basket case
- They met up for a coffee and Dom was honest about how Ella made her feel and that was the last time she saw her. Felt that Ella wanted to pretend nothing happened
- Was something shes not saying that only Ella and 1 other person know the truth and have to live with, won't share because it's private",13,1731482317.0,MAFS_AU,5,0.88,False

However... Coffee. One cup and I am going through the roof. I cannot drink it anymore. And for some reason it seems even harder for me to stay away from coffee than stay away from alcohol. 

At this point it is frustrating to me. Yesterday I drank coffee in the afternoon. My intrusive thoughts were horrible, I got anxiety until I was trembling, nauseous and my heart was racing. It kept me up until 03.00.

With alcohol and coffee I felt like I had ""a little moment"" for me. A treat in someway. I tried drinking tea, lots of different kinds, but it is so flavorless compared to alcohol and coffee.

There are so much harder things in life, but I guess I just had to complain a bit. When drinking lots of alcohol and caffeine, I was less healthy, but I felt like I was able to give myself a break. I kind of lost that.

1gq77a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1gq77a8/im_lonely_in_college/,I’m lonely in college.,"I’m sorry in advance, I really just need to rant.

I’m a freshman in college and the semester ends in 3 weeks at the time of writing this. For the most part, I’ve had a really good semester so far. My grades are really good… and that’s about it.

I’m extremely academically driven so quite honestly I think the only source of my happiness is the fact I have an A in every class. But at the same time, I’m so incredibly lonely. 

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m about as introverted as you can get. I LOVE my alone time, and I talk to myself all the time to help me think and process my emotions. But, having gone through almost my entire first semester, I really haven’t met anyone. Sure, I have my roommates (but they’re not my favorite people if I’m being completely honest) and I’ve met a few people in my classes who I’ve worked with on projects, but that’s about it. We don’t hang out or do anything outside of class unless it’s school related, which also usually isn’t that often either. I don’t view these people as friends, but rather, just acquaintances.

I’m fully aware that this is my own fault though. The problem is I have a lot of social anxiety and find it very difficult to just go out and meet people. Others make it sound so easy. I’ve never been to a party, or even a football game at my college. Instead, I have the luxury of only being about an hour away from home, so I drive back home most weekends. If I end up hanging out with any friends, it’s kids younger than me who I met in high school. Not complaining about that though, just saying.

I just want one, solid friendship. Just because I love my alone time doesn’t mean I don’t want someone to hang out with. I see other people bonding and having a great time with others, and I long for that with someone my age. Yes I’ve joined a few clubs, but nobody really sticks out to me. Let alone, I don’t think I stick out to them.

I just don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m doing college wrong. No football games, no parties (not that those interest me anyway), just me, my thoughts, and my academics. 

For my high school friends and friends who are my age but have all gone to different schools, I’d do anything for them. I truly value each and every one of my close friends very much. And I’m simple too. Doing small, simple things brings me so much joy. Going to grab coffee, studying together, hell, even sitting on the grass and just talking. I feel like I’m not asking for much, but maybe I am. I just wish I could have one, close friend. Sometimes it’s lonely being alone.",3,1731481318.0,introvert,4,1.0,False

I am Steven and I am an Energist. I’m looking to meet and connect with other like-minded individuals in the Greater Sacramento/Roseville/Auburn, CA area. 

An Energist is a person that relates and interacts with the world with the understanding that we are connected via the atomic and subatomic energy that comprises all matter. That energy can also be manipulated towards an action or goal. 

I have been a practicing pagan for over 25 years. I began in Wicca and Celtic witchcraft with some Chinese energy work thrown in for good measure. 

An Energist Gathering is typically a one-on-one discussion. Think of it as a chat over tea or coffee with magic/energy use at its core. 

This is for 18+ simply because an Energist faces adult topics during discussions such as trauma, mental health, and other themes. 

The codes of conduct are centered on being a good person. Fellow pagans of all paths are welcome. All views should be respected. No one may force another to discuss or share anything they don’t wish to share or talk about. Any energy work is conducted with the consent of all involved. 

The beginning for anyone wishing to explore what it means to be an Energist starts with these questions. Please feel free to DM me your answers or any other questions you may have. 

1. What is the difference between seeing vs. looking, listening vs. hearing, and knowing vs. understanding?

2. What is the difference between living in a mirror and living in a painting? 

There is a third question but it is too long to post here. DM me if you are interested.

Lately, my anxiety has been much worse in a way I haven’t experienced before. I’m not sure if it’s OCD related or not, but I’ve become so dysfunctional. And it sounds so silly, because it’s over the littlest things that my mind starts malfunctioning. Every day feels like I’m just surviving through, trying to get past whatever fog has come over my brain. I can no longer make decisions, no matter how small they are. I will spend hours upon hours agonizing over choices and most of my day I’m in a state of limbo. I will stand at the grocery store in the same aisle for god knows who long because I’m unable to make a choice. I went to the store to get the same candle I always get. But I just stare at the number of sizes this candle comes in. And I stare and stare and go through mentally why this option may be wrong or why the other option might be wrong. Some of them had three wicks instead of two, maybe that should factor into my decision. I’ll sit in parking lots for 30+ minutes doing nothing but trying to decide what I’m going to do when and where I’m going to go. It’s the silliest thing but it has become so extreme that I’ve barely been eating. I’m a college student for context. “Should I make dinner now?” *takes out ingredients. “No, I should make this other dinner I had planned for later in the week. Wait, I have no time to make a dinner right now. Maybe I should make coffee and breakfast for dinner and stay up until I finish my assignment. Or maybe I should go to sleep now and wake up early and just eat then instead.” And I spent from 8:30 pm to midnight going back and forth, procrastinating my work, unable to make a decision about food, and stressing. Sometimes I’ll just sit down and think and think why can’t I organize my thoughts why can’t I just decide why am I so dysfunctional. I haven’t eaten today.

1gq744j,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1gq744j/in_need_of_some_advice/,In need of some advice ,"Hey everyone,

So recently I (27M) was overseas on a trip with a friend. The trip was kind of a group booking situation with 200 other people from different countries. It was an amazing experience and I meet some cool open minded people. But there was this one person (26F) who I really hit it off with. We had great chemistry right from the start, and that lead to us sleep together later on trip. It was some of the best sex I've ever had and she agreed.

So the next day she tells me she's in a open relationship. I'm quite open minded and have have threesomes in the past, so it wasn't much of a issue. We found out around the same time they we live really close to each other, as in 30min drive. She wanted to keep seeing me when we got back but wasn't sure if her partner would be okay with it. I said if he's fine with it then I'm all for seeing each other again.

So now fast forward. We're back from the trip and kept in contact, she's still really interested in seeing me again. Her partner is quite vanilla in the bed room and she wants to spice it up occasionally. That's where i come in apparently? Anyways she's tell this to her partner and he's unsure about it at first. He doesn't want her talking to me all the time and I think is a bit worried I'm going to run away with her. So she asks me if I'm willing to meet the guy and have a sit down chat over coffee about what our boundaries are. 

Now coffees booked for this weekend and I'm not sure how to have this conversation with the guy? He's a few years younger than us and like I said I'm really open and honest when it comes to sex. But I like this girl also and don't want the situation to get messy and ruin someone else's relationship?? 

Anybody have any experience in this department, I would like to hear other people takes on it. ",2,1731480964.0,polyamory,6,1.0,False

1gq70f5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1gq70f5/how_much_is_too_much/,How much is too much?,"Yesterday, I had a pretty intense anxiety attack. It felt like I was on the verge of meeting my creator, like I was about to leave this planet. Has anyone else ever experienced something like this? It was a wake-up call for me, and I'm struggling to figure out how to manage everything that’s on my plate.

I’ve been working on building a career in sales, but lately, I feel like I'm trying to do *way* too many things at once. I'm spread thin across several projects, and it’s starting to feel like I'm drowning. I’m wondering if anyone has tips for delegating tasks or managing multiple commitments effectively. Should I cut out some of the activities I’m pursuing? How would you approach my situation if you were in my shoes?

# My Background

Earlier this year, I graduated from a university in Asia at 30 years old. It took me longer than usual because of medical, financial, and personal reasons, but I finally made it. I've been working since I was 16, doing everything from customer service and English tutoring to running my own business. I set a big goal after graduating — I want to make $30 million in 5 years. It's been about 5 months since I set this goal, and I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders.

# My Current Projects

Right now, I'm juggling a lot of different things:

1. **Coffee Importing:** I'm helping a friend build his coffee import business from the ground up. At the moment, it’s not making much money, but I help with sales and find companies to buy coffee directly from the distributor. I meet with him 1-3 times a week.
2. **Commodity Trading:** I'm working part-time for free at a small company to learn about commodity trading. I haven't gone full-time yet because I'm planning to visit my family in my home country for about two months. My goal is to learn enough to start closing international deals while I'm there.
3. **Jiujitsu Fitness Community:** This is a passion project. I started a jiujitsu fitness community from scratch. I initially bought mats to train with friends, but it quickly grew. Now we have around 15 people training together, and I recently held my first paid class (split earnings with a friend 80/20). I’m building out my online presence to expand this further, but I’m not sure what to do with the space while I’m away.
4. **English Tutoring:** This is my main source of income, but I’m really unhappy with it. I teach kids who don’t respect my time or boundaries, and I don’t feel appreciated. But it's the only stable income I have right now, so I’m stuck with it.

# The Struggle

I see all of my ventures as long-term investments, and I understand that building something worthwhile takes time and effort. However, I’m currently working 80+ hours a week, from Monday to Sunday, trying to balance all these commitments. I’m exhausted and stretched thin.

The stress of managing so many projects, while also carrying the weight of financial and family responsibilities, is overwhelming. I feel like I'm burning out, but I don't want to quit or give up on any of my goals. I know that making big changes requires a lot of upfront investment, but I wonder if there are better ways to delegate or manage my time.

# Questions for the Community:

* How do you manage multiple projects or businesses without burning out?
* Do you have tips on delegating tasks effectively to free up your time?
* Should I cut down on some of my ventures to focus on the most promising ones, or is it worth sticking to all of them in the long term?
* How can I better manage the mental load that comes with trying to balance work, family, and personal goals?

**Conclusion:**

To be honest, I feel like I’m standing at a crossroads — torn between the fear of burning out and the desire to keep pushing forward toward my dreams. I’d really appreciate any advice or insights from those who have been in similar situations or who’ve managed to balance multiple ventures. I'm willing to put in the work, but I just need some direction on how to do so without sacrificing my mental or physical well-being. Thanks in advance for any help!

I have been late almost everyday since I started two weeks ago… I’m chronically late in general and have huge issues with time blindness and time management. I set timers in the morning to try and give myself a warning at 9:00am, then out the door at 9:30am… but I always seem to be missing something (my coffee, my lunch, brushing my teeth).

I am in lala land for hours and my “30 minutes before you leave” timer goes off and I’m scrambling to get ready. I have tried taking ADHD meds to help and I feel cracked out and awful. 

All of this comes with a lot of shame and beating myself up… I have had issues being on time my entire life (work, flights, hanging with friends, dates, appointments). A friend thought it was because I was just dreading work, but it’s not JUST work- it affects all kinds of things I must be on time for. Any tips or help??

That same month of the accident, this girl randomly calls him at night from her friends phone drunk saying she was pregnant and had an abortion and that it was weighing heavy on her to tell him. mind you, I still didn’t get confirmation of a said relationship overseas (these are things I’m finding out as I finally decided to search through his phone the ONE time throughout our entire relationship). Ultimately, I played it off like I never knew about anything. Until 3 months after I couldn’t hold it in anymore, and then he decided spill what I knew all along. He says he never talked to her after he came home from the deployment hence why she had to reach out from a friends phone. Here, I fell for the “I realized she wasn’t you” “I won’t hide anything blah blah” Welp, here comes the new year. Everyrhing is going good, I did have occasions where I needed reassurance and welp, he says he had a drill training (for military) and this was when the things were going on within Ukraine… He turns off his location and says that they are making all soldiers take off their locations as it could be a liability and hand in their phones (i didn’t believe that but I did at the same time). I open my Instagram app and look and see the same girl from the deployment who he got pregnant and they are together (this girl lives on the other side of the country from where we’re from). I guess they do never change. 

I have since cut off contact in January but it’s still a situation that weighs deeply. He found out the grass wasn’t greener on the other side though as he tries to text my phone and spill on his life. says she hits him, is always romantically talking to her child’s father and even smashed his cell phone. and now claims he no longer speaks to her. he’s created fake social media pages to stalk my accounts and has his friends text me for updates. From August- beginning of October he has sent flowers and all sorts of things to my house! But towards the end of the month he has since stopped trying to reach out. 

I can’t lie though, I am not a very physical touch and super emotional person and his was. And this was something that always gave us a problem. And he claims this is why he did what he did. But I did try. He also had a super high sex drive but sex was super bleh to me so I never really cared to have it (just did it for his own pleasure). 

And honesty, I thought he was the perfect man ever. My mom adored him! I went away to college and he would bring her coffee, take her to work. Anything my family needed, he was there and would check up. He would bring me lunch and flowers to work. Hold my doors and so much more that you don’t see in this generation anymore. I never thought someone could be so picture perfect and do everything correctly  but be such a lie all along! 

Moral of the story, why do men cheat? What’s to gain especially when you’re asked occasionally if you’d like to see other people??? And why can’t I seem to move on. I feel like I do but then I get random ways of times like this. I’ll go search and look through his social medias and see if he’s still messing with that girl. And then one day I go back to not having a care in the world…",2,1731480282.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I know nothing about real espresso machines besides the 1 hour of research I just did, and it's pretty overwhelming. I'm seeing all kind of words and language I don't understand. I was looking at the Breville barista one until I saw many people say it's not good because you are overpaying for a mediocre grinder, and that the grinder is very important and better purchased separately. Then I was looking at the Breville Bambino, and read how it's the most affordable un-pressurized machine. But then when I looked up the difference between un-pressurized vs. Pressurized, it says un-pressurized is better for beginners because it's more forgiving if you don't pack the coffee grinds good, etc.

Can anybody help me figure out what to buy? All I want is to be able to enjoy high quality coffee from home, without a super huge learning curve. I understand it'll take a bit of practice but I would like my coffee still to come out good even if I don't do a perfect job (because I don't know what I don't know about coffee).

Floors are the hardwood that's not wood (laminate?) and scratch easy. Bought a new wood coffee table and it's heavy, when moving it to get cats toys from underneath it, it scratched the crap out of the floor. It's a darker floor, like the red-ish oak color 

Question 1: best way and cost efficient way to fix the scratch? tried rejuvenate but not sure it helps. 

Question 2: where can I find pads for the coffee table legs? as I often can only find them for dining chairs. I'd prefer bigger. Obviously.

It's an apartment I rent. Obviously you rarely get full damage deposit back anyway, but I still would like to remedy this if it's easy enough.

I live on the other side of the world while my mum (and family) live back in Netherlands. I will visit her in September/August and like to do something special.

I'm looking to take her on holiday as she work very hard and I want to spend some nice time with her. She doesn't know yet and I want to take her to Spain for +/- a week. We will drive as she isn't allowed to fly for the next 2 years (something with the lungs, so not an option).

But where in Spain?

She loves beach and swimming and is not an experienced traveller. She likes when it's not too busy but loves to go out for coffee or food while watching people. She is an easy eater and loves to try new things. But also loves the friendly people when she is in another country.

I am also a food lover and love watching people but I'm more active. I can be all day at the beach but also love to go for a hike or a walk through town and nature.

Restaurant food? Eating out in general. mediocre most of the time. Coffees seem to be cut with more artificial stuff then usual. 

Build quality of consumer goods from appliances to toys? Huge difference. 

Quality of digital platforms from social media to online shopping? HUGE loss there, amazon is seemingly 90% cheap oversees knockoffs with poor build quality.   
  
The internet? A simple google search? Have fun scrolling through 17 AI pictures for a actual image of what you want.  

Even aesthetically it seems businesses have become more plastic and dismal then usual. With logos themselves being shaven down.

This doesn't feel like the usual ""well, you are looking at the world with older eyes"" more like corners are being cut everywhere.
