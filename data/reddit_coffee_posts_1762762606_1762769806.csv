1ot9vpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ot9vpt/downpour/,Downpour,"The rain was torrential. There is an all-encompassing sensation when standing in the midst of such a storm. Your hearing is drowned by the onslaught. The water trails down your face, stifling your nose and blurring your vision. Your fingers clutch in your jacket, gripping damp fabric. Your chin naturally tilts downward to avoid it. All of your senses focused on the ground, to the tempestuous tapping of the wash. All of my senses were focused on the ground.

I was heading home. That’s what the road told me. I wasn’t sure from where I exited, but I was glad of it. My mind was adrift. Lost in the rain. The pavement curved and bent like a serpent, dragging me left and right, and left again. I shambled along the edge, between the black road and the lush, green grass. Soon, the path diverted. Left, left, and left again. Then I knew I was heading home.

I had walked this road many times before, but never blind. But I knew the way. And now, more than ever, I knew my way. I was enlightened, because magic was real. I had seen it. Magic, aether, witchcraft, enchantment. Something was real. But I couldn’t think about it. I had to get home. I couldn’t think in this.

My head tilted upwards. There was a color adrift in the sea of gray and green. Brown. Home. I quickened my pace, my feet clambering against the murky puddles in the path, my sneaker dipping once too far into a hole of reclaimed gravel. The cold in my foot jolted me awake, the water creeping into my sock and leaving an uncomfortable slosh with each step I took. I looked up again. Brown, and red.

I stood against the base of the steps. Pine logs, split in half by my own two hands. It filled me with great comfort, my ark against the flood. I climbed hastily, my left hand gripping the wooden rail tight as I saw how pale it had become. My drowned foot nearly slipped as I rushed to be under the awning. The relief was immediate, as the downpour lost its intensity the moment I breached under. The last bits of water dripped from my face, and I wiped my eyes with a slippery sleeve then breathed deep the humid air. Yes, I could breathe again. I looked upwards. Red.

Did I know this woman? My mind wandered. My window was broken, I noticed. Fractured through the middle with sharp, wet shards clinging against the wooden frame. A tinge of deep crimson clung to one of them. The same color as the sight below me. This woman. Did I know her? I couldn’t tell. She was split in half. Her face was unrecognizable, save for the black, damp hair clung to what remained of her skull. Where the rest of her head would be, void. Some monstrosity had cleaved her into two. Tendrils of muscle and sinew desperately reached from one side of the corpse to the other as if trying to reconnect, but they never met. Bits of unrecognizable flesh clung to her jacket like morbid ornaments. Her arms lay upturned on either side, her palms facing up. My eyes followed them. Deep red blood splatter littered the roof of my canopy, the force of her demise painting the planks I called my home. Her waist and lower half were intact, slumped against my cabin, legs placed together in a nightmarishly calm contrast to the rest of her body. For a brief moment, I contemplated checking her pulse. What was I thinking? I opened the door, and went inside.

So magic is real. And so are angels. What else?

———————————

It had been seven months since I gave up on the world. It started as a hobby— a personal vent for the frustrations of a miserable, monotonous life. Self sufficiency. To stand alone among my wooden constructs and know that I have created something more important than I ever had before. I remember the relief I felt when submitting a data entry summary to my supervisor. Faint, fleeting, plastic. The comparison to the ecstasy of building something, for me, with my own two hands, was night and day. I never felt so human before, when sweat furrowed my brow with a hacksaw in my hand and an open box of nails splayed against the soft dirt.

I was trapped before, in an office, surrounded by cold bodies in a cold cement box where I could safely generate profit. My smiles flew across silent lips. My kind words on deaf ears. Here, amongst the smell of crisp pine needles and nectar, I had freed myself from those wretched creatures that had dared to call themselves alive. I was alive, and a gentle, warm rain had grazed itself across the horizon. It was morning. 7 AM.

My window was open. A long, white cord slinked through the opening and onto the counter-top against the wall of my shelter. I made my way over to it. The rain cast a light, metallic tapping against the portable solar battery I laid flat atop a pine stump through the window. My phone flickered to life as I tapped it. 43 percent. I wouldn’t get to watch much today. I had powerbanks prepared for this, but the rain had fallen so consistently this past week my preparation had failed. I couldn’t care less. My real anxiety would come when I started to run out of coffee, and the nightmare of briefly returning to civilization would fill a pit in my stomach once more. Two missed calls, I noticed.

Jona had perhaps the squarest face you’ve ever seen. He was a blocky man in general. His body was built like a fridge, and his straight shoulders lead to large, flabby arms that would hug you the moment he realized he could call you friend. His hair was a thin, dark red, that showed the similar signs of aging as his wrinkled eyes and the dimples in his fat face that would always be smiling. He really did look dumb, but he was always thinking. And I liked him. Jona was one of my only connections to the outside world, and the labor I occasionally performed for him provided the meager amount of money I needed to sustain my lifestyle. So I was happy to talk to him, and I called as soon a I saw.

“Jack?” His voice was littered with a southern drawl. And I could tell he was smiling.

“Hey big guy, what’s the word?”

“We missed ya for Thanksgiving. Sarah wanted to show you her drawings.”

“Sorry Jona, I got busy.”

“Got a girlfriend?” Now I smiled.

“Maybe next time I’m in town.”

His laugh was a booming one, and knowing him I could tell his free hand was clutching his stomach to accentuate it. “So what’s the word?” I asked, somewhat impatiently. So much time alone has made me weary using my voice, and Jona and his family were only a short exception.

“Chant-er-ells, Jack!”

“Chanterelles?”

“The mushrooms you brought last year, Claire had her roast ready for them! But Jack was too busy to show, huh.”

“Sorry, man…”

Jona scoffed dismissively. He knew how hard it was for me to come to anything, even if he liked to pretend.

“Don’t worry about it!” He boomed. “But the missus was really looking forward to them. And I told her, huh, that if we want old Jack and his chant-er-ells around, we gotta pay him for it, hah!” I heard the stomach slapping this time.

“So when you got some time, how about you saunter on down to that secret ‘ol spot of yours and fetch us a basket? Got a twenty with your name on it!”

“Just twenty?”

“Thirty?”

“Now that’s just fine, Jona.” I mimicked his drawl.

The cabin was tiny, much smaller than my Burbank studio, but ten times as spacious. The walls were hardly walls, not because of their shoddy construction, but because the outside was shared with no-one else. The dirt, the pines, the pollen and the cabin was my apartment. And what a beauty the cabin was! Several feet of walking space, a cast iron stove, sanded counters, and a lowered room I had rigged with a camp shower that fed to a rain-catcher on the roof. The same split logs I had used for my stairs made up a small bed frame, accompanied with a mattress Claire so generously demanded I take when I informed them I was sleeping in my jacket on top of wood. The dark red sheets I clung to every night matched well. I prided myself over my handiwork as I opened the small under-croft from a latch in the corner of the floor, pulling out a fresh jacket from one of my bags and making my way to the door.

I pulled it shut as I stepped outside. Even after seven months away, my hand still reached instinctively into my pocket to look for my keys for the door. But there was none. Home invaders were a rarity. I zipped my jacket up as I glanced towards the tree line. The rain was getting heavier— not that it bothered me.

The air was sharp and biting as I approached the edge, prickling the skin of my exposed wrists above my gloves. A wind was whistling through the pines, mournful yet comforting gusts breathing renewal against my cheeks. The trees were straight as I neared it, but in my peripheral seemed to curve and bend to stay in my sight. I placed my hand against black bark as I entered, the rough surface thick with moisture that slipped my palm and made me nearly trip as I stepped over a winding root.

Silvery ribbons of gray light pierced through the canopy as I followed a game-trail deep into the woods. The rays peaked through the leaves, landing upon mossy rocks and lighting them up like faintly glowing emeralds while soft strands of water pattered against them. Wet leaves squelched under my boots as I hopped and ducked over branches, boulders, and boughs. Gnarled roots twisted into the trail as I got deeper, reclaiming the dirt that had been trodden upon. After twenty minutes or so, I heard the familiar noise I was waiting for.

A throaty hum reverberated through the pines. I deviated from my path to chase it. The dead, brown leaves and dirt began to turn into a more lush green as I neared my prize. The mist was hanging low, curling around the ancient pines like ghostly hands as I made my way through them. Ducking over one more dripping branch I reached it. My stream. Perhaps hundreds of years ago some native or settler had called it theirs, but not anymore. I took comfort knowing I was the only living man to know her, and she rewarded me in kind.

There they were, laying against the mossy streamside, tiny bolts of yellow flame reaching for the sky. My prize. They stood out so vividly against the pale surroundings it was a wonder the hares haven’t eaten them all. The guilt of removing their beauty from this world filled my stomach as I kneeled down along the stream, but the thought of fresh coffee compelled me on.

I took my glove off, placing it in my jacket as I dipped my left hand into the stream. Ice, ice cold. I cupped my hand and drew it upwards, droplets of water splashing back into the stream as I put my lips to it and drank it down. It was abnormally refreshing. I wiped my hand along the sweater underneath my jacket, and put my glove back on. The chanterelles were ripe, and I stood back up to near one, before kneeling down again and gripping it between my gloved fingers. The moisture permeated them, and the squishiness made me toughen my grip as I went to wrench it out.

Snap. A twig broke. Fifty feet away, my ears told me. And a big one. The forest fell deathly quiet. My breathing went sharp and I went still as even the stream itself seemed to deafen from the sudden noise. No birds, no frogs, no water. Quiet. I glanced through the trees.

Snap. Thirty feet? Shadows lurched through the black pines. A droplet of water hit my face and clouded my eye, and for a moment the entire forest appeared as a crowd of thin, black figures stretching to the clouds. I wiped my face and stayed silent, like a deer looking for a hunter in the bush. Just trees. I don’t know how long I stood there in silence, but when I moved again the sound in the world resumed. I plucked the mushroom out remorselessly, barely moving off my knees as I went to the next, and the next, until my bag had enough that Jona wouldn’t look at me funny. Still, I noticed I was shivering. Unusual for this weather, but I brushed it off as a cold-snap.

Yes, definitely much colder. The air seemed to turn frosty as I stood up all the way, straightening my back with a stretch. The fog of my breath suddenly seemed more pronounced as I warmed my gloves with it. But the breeze from upstream brought something else. Honey, berries, and.. Something rotting. I tilted my head and looked up the river. Just pines. Bringing my bag to my front, I opened it and inspected the chanterelles. They smelled tart, earthy, maybe sweet, but certainly not rotting.

Something was off, though. The firelight of the mushrooms I had observed when plucking them from the stream never really seemed to dissipate. It was as if they were glowing from some luminescence under the darkness of my bag. As I gazed closer, it wasn’t that simple. They were pulsing, like heartbeats. My head drifted closer into the bag, until my entire vision were the mushrooms, glowing, beating, so faintly and subtly I wanted to draw even closer to understand whether what I was seeing was real or just an imagination.

Badum, badum, badum. The chanterelles pulsated.

Snap. A sound came across the stream. I dared not look behind me. I wasn’t a superstitious man, and living alone in the woods had taught me that the things that went bump in the night were usually just rabbits and possums. But something felt so, so different. My pack seemed to beat quicker against my chest as I withdrew my head. I had to leave. I didn’t know why, but I had to. I started walking, my feet trudging through the wet grass, seemingly not able to find the grip they once had on their way in. I slipped and stumbled against wet undergrowth as I gripped and pulled through wet boughs. Farther and farther away from my stream.

I quickened my pace. The rain was heavier now, sharp, like silver needles blurring my path and picking at my hood. A feeling of dread pierced me. The foliage was dense and unrecognizable as I prayed that the game-trail was behind every bush, every pine. Looking back, I don’t know why such a sudden fear overtook me from just the sound of snapping twigs. But the ice that gripped my heart at that moment compelled me to return to my cabin as quickly as possible.

Until I cleared the next layer of brush, I had no reason to be afraid. No trail, again, but rested on a low hanging branch perched a raven unlike any I had ever seen. The top of his head was tufted, like a black jagged crown atop his head, giving him a regal presence as he stared. But it was how he stared that was the most alarming. The creature had whites in his eyes, highlighting the murky brown that made me freeze. His pupils were rectangular. The beast just stood there, staring, head turned, looking at me straight in the eyes. The beating rain was incessant. I refused to blink under his gaze.

“What?” I asked, to the non-sentient creature.

He perched only 5 feet from me, and the tension between me and this thing cut the air like knives.

“What!?!” I shouted at it.

Those awful eyes turned to my right. I looked. Water pooled in puddles between the dark pines. Dead leaves floated in clusters. I looked back at the thing, and it was still gazing that way.

Snap. A twig broke from my left. My eyes instinctively darted to it. A shadow broke among the pines, a standing shadow that blended in with the rest, darting quickly between those that stood still. It moved soundlessly, leaving only a blur of mist in its wake. The hair on the back of my neck bristled and froze. Before I knew it, I was running, more like a shambling jog on the thicket. My boots clashed noisily against the puddles, spraying water that leaped all the way up to my knees as I covered my face with my right forearm, blinking constantly to try to free my vision. Branches clawed at my sleeves, and the smell of rotting fruit seemed to permeate through the forest. I spat rain.

After what seemed like an eternity of my desperate scrambling, I tripped. The soft grass that hit my face certainly didn’t feel that way. I laid there quietly, listening to the rain as my nose dug into mud. Finally, I looked up. A brown twisting serpent clung to the floor. The trail. Bitter adrenaline shot into my veins as I quickly rose to my feet. Mud littered my jacket and I saw it on my cheeks in my peripheral. I resumed the run, following the path quickly as the ground was easier to push myself through. It wasn’t long before I saw what felt like heaven itself. The trees broke, and the mist that swirled through the pines seemed to dissipate at its edge. I crashed through, and instantly the air was soft and open again. What the hell was I even running from? A bird?

The snaps had faded, but my heart was still pounding, and I tasted copper in my mouth. Putting my arm to my forehead once more I searched my surroundings. The cabin was there. But something else was as well. A car was parked on my path, nose facing the cabin, both tires dug into the grass that had been no more than a shod of gravel for walking. I didn’t even have a license. I approached cautiously.

There, arms crossed, was a woman leaning against my window. Her hair was black, her eyes hazel, and her lips were pouty. I stared. She stared back at me, just like that god damn bird. I walked in silence towards the rail, looking up at her until I neared the steps. Finally, she spoke.

“So this is what you do now?”

I looked down. My jacket was caked in mud. Strips of wet grass clung to my hair that stuck to my cheek. My nose was covered.

“I got lost.” I stammered.

She scoffed, rolling her eyes and tightening her arms closer to her chest. I felt the disappointment in her as she looked me up and down.

“What are you even doing here?” She asked in a sigh. I sighed too.

“Do you want to come in?”

I climbed the steps in silence. I could feel her watching me. I wanted to tell her to leave, that she didn’t belong here, that her cropped jacket was stupid and impractical, but instead I pulled at the latch and opened the door. She took a peek inside, stood there for a few moments, and then went in. I went in after her.

The moment I latched the door, the sound of the rain fled, and the constant ringing of my ear finally leaving put me at peace. I leaned against the logs and breathed deep. I was so glad to be indoors and not being pelted by water I had completely forgotten the woman sauntering around my kitchen, picking up my one pot in her hand and inspecting the bottom of it, while her other traced along my counter-top. She took the few steps to the other wall, bending down and opening the stove-door with her long nails. I looked at her dismissively.

Finally, she made her way to my bed, sitting on the edge of it facing me and crossing her legs. I placed my pack on the ground next to the door. She looked up at me with a smile that would almost come off as polite if her eyes moved with it at all.

“So.. This is what you do now.”

I sighed again, walking past her towards the slump in the corner of my room. I turned on the camp shower and felt the cold rainwater hit my face once more. I wiped with both palms, wrenching the mud and grass off my face before forcibly pushing it off my jacket. It clumped together on the dirt floor of the hole. She didn’t say anything else, and I was the first to speak as I buried my face into a soft towel I had on the shelf next to me.

“Do you want coffee?”

She scoffed again. Annoying, I thought, so annoying. She looked around the room again, before looking at me puzzlingly.

“Is this about Mom?” She asked.

I rolled my eyes, grabbing the pot she scrutinized and turning on the camp shower again, filling it near the brim before shoving it into the stove, kneeling down and retrieving a lighter from the top of it to light the tinder I had already prepared. The fire brought warmth to the room that my sister could never hope to achieve.

“Mom didn’t even care about us.” I retorted.

“So then why do this?” She put her palms up and looked around to make a point.

“I like it here.” I stared at the fire.

“You don’t even have air-conditioning.”

“You’re so stupid.” I argued.

I stood up, facing her with the fire at my back as I took off my jacket and placed it on the ground next to the flames.

“Is that why you drove all the way out here? To make fun of me? How did you even find this place?”

She smiled and turned up her chin at me.

“Your card was used for a few months at that market down the road. All it took was a few questions before I found that fat guy. Is he your family now?”

“He’s a friend.”

“Oh I know, believe me. It took only about two minutes before he invited me to dinner.”

I didn’t respond, and that must’ve angered her. She snapped, clapping her hands together.

“Stop dodging my questions! What are you doing out here!? Playing survivor in the woods? What’s wrong with you!? First I hear you get a promotion to middle-management, and then next I hear you quit and then your phone is off and…”

I zoned out. She trailed on with countless questions about my absence. I wrapped my hand around the same towel as she pattered on and retrieved my pot of boiling water from the stove. I dripped it through my primitive filter and through the ground beans into two cups, then brought it to her as she was still talking. She didn’t react, so I placed it on the shelf next to my bed, and sat down in a crude chair next to the fire. She stopped talking as I finally responded.

“It wasn’t about mom. I hated my life. I was late every fucking morning because I couldn’t get out of bed. I was miserable. Didn’t you notice? Every single day. The same fucking thing. How do YOU live like that?”

She stared at me for a moment with those annoying hazel eyes, and shrugged.

“So this is the solution? Build a cute little cabin, make a fire, put a shower in it and what? Hang out with an old guy the rest of your life? Am I going to find you dead here one day?”

“Probably.”

She stood up, her fists clenched as her nails dug into her own skin. I saw the anger and feeling of betrayal in her eyes as I stared blankly. Steam rose from her lonely cup.

“Well go die then! See if I care!” She pointed at her chest. “I’m not the one who gave up, that’s what you did, you gave up! You had a few bad days and ran away. Does that remind you of anyone?!”

I knew she was speaking about our father, but I never knew him, and he certainly wasn’t anything like me. Even if she had any memories of him, she was only a few years older than me, so I doubted they meant anything. Why should I care if she thinks I’m like him?

“No, it doesn’t remind me of anyone.”

“YOU are an idiot, Jack.”

She pulled at the latch to my door. It didn't open. I sighed, putting my palm over hers and pushing the latch sideways so it actually unhinged. She flinched as we touched, and I quickly pulled away once it was free. The door opened to a cool breeze flying inside. It was traded for her as she quickly made her way down my stairs. They looked rigid, more clumsily made than I remember, like a child playing with sticks as she made her way down. A wet black feather clung to the top step.

She didn’t turn as she walked to her car door, boots splattering the rain as it dampened her hair. Finally, she looked back, and I couldn’t tell if there were tears in her eyes or just rain. Her voice was ragged.

“I love you Jack, please take care of yourself.”

“I love you too, Rosa.”

The forest and I watched her leave.

———————————

Several days past before I would venture into those woods again. They no longer seemed as homely as they had once. The bright, shining rays of light that would bounce between the leaves now cackled in hues of dark gray that seemed to sharply cut from branch to branch. A harsh wind was blowing out of them at all times of the day, and at night it sent an ominous whistle that made me shiver as I relieved myself at the edge. And the rain. The rain never stopped. Every day I expected it to part. Every day I was disappointed. For the next few days, the only thing that broke the monotony was the return of that old dog.

I saw him first before the storm came, and never expected to see him again. Old, skinny, black and blind. He had droopy ears and a long dark snout with white bristles at the tip fitting for his age. One of his eyes was scarred, and the other white with cataracts. The dog walked with a limp, quite efficiently as one would expect someone who has had an injury for a while would. His ribs gauntly poked from his sides, and I could only wonder how such a poor decrepit thing managed to survive.

The first time, staring through my glass, I only watched him. He roamed across the grass, his nose sniffing at the ground, idly chasing some invisible scent. Like an ant following a false trail, he walked in circles, on and off the gravel until I grew tired of watching the scene and stood up. I opened the melted icebox underneath my counter, and retrieved some smoked hare wrapped in plastic. But when I turned to open the door, he was gone. I stepped outside to scan for him, and down the road I saw him paddling along, nose to the ground and sniffing away at the dirt as he limped down the path. That was the last time I had felt the warmth of the sun, while calling for him.

But here, in the middle of this never-ending storm, he returned.

I was quicker this time. No need for my last hare if he left. The door opened with a loud creak, and there he was. Roaming in a circle outside of my cabin, and for a moment I smiled. Normalcy at last!

“Hey!” I called in as friendly of a tone as I could muster.

The hound’s body was soaked with water, dripping to the floor like udders from a cow. The only long fur he had was on his chin, matting his beard that looked as if he had just dunked it into a water bowl. I called again, but he made no attempt at responding. He continued to roam, one more circle, sniffing so close to the gravel I worried he had been inhaling rocks. So I just watched him, not like there was anything better to do with my phone dead. Finally, I grew frustrated. Was he deaf?

“Hey, come on!”

This time I patted my leg afterwards. His head immediately turned, and he began to nonchalantly began to limp towards the steps, not so much as sparing me a glance as his nose continued to smell the ground. I stepped outside, figuring I would have to carry him up the steps, but just as idly as he began to walk towards me he climbed them, barely putting any weight on the left paw that ailed him as he reached the top. The door was open, but he stopped at the window next to it, sniffing the plank under it with intention. I tilted my head as he did the same. And then he turned, and limped on inside.

Figuring he was not one much for conversation, I came through and latched the door shut after him. He quickly found his way to the stove, slinking his skinny torso between the legs of my chair, lying down with his tail and thigh next to the softly burning flames. He made no sigh that I expected from other dogs who found a comfortable spot, simply closing his eyes and going still. I retrieved one of the few remaining strips of hare I had left from before my last encounter in the woods. He didn’t react as I approached him, placing it at his nose. His eye opened, and I could see the clouds of white up close. Like a soft fog they obscured anything resembling a pupil, and I found myself overcome with pity at the thought of such a creature. How horrible it must be to lose your grip on vision and not even to know what was happening.

He sniffed once at the strip, and I grinned wide, happy to share with my new neighbor his first meal in what I assumed was a long time. Instead, he outstretched his left paw, touching the strip of jerky with calloused pads. His nails were dark and blunt, long and crooked. and there was some kind of crimson coming from between his pads. I knelt down and looked closer. Blood, old, but not very, coming from the middle of his paw. I looked at the others. His back legs looked fine, but I could not see his right, being folded against his chest. I reached out, and he did not react, so I gripped his skinny arm gently, and stretched it out. Blood, again. What the hell? A soft splatter of crimson stained the inner sides of his pad and matted the soft fur. I pushed on his paw gently to get a better look, and once again he did not react. There was some wound between them, and I couldn’t possibly tell what in the low light. So instead I got some antibacterial wipes out from my shelf, wiping both paws clean as his eyes closed and he remained motionless. After I was done, I waved the strip of jerky in front of his nose again, which he sniffed, opened his eyes, and closed them once more. He didn't pant, didn’t whine, didn’t even breathe loud enough to hear over the crackling of the stove.

I spent a long while looking at him as I stripped and got into bed. Motionless, he slept, while I tossed and turned, assaulted by the breaking of wood lost to flames and the patter of the storm through my window that seemed to grow only louder the quieter it got. When sleep finally found me, it only made me feel worse. Vines, horns and eyes. Roots coiled around my throat, tasting of iron and spores. That's all I dreamed of.",1,1762768799.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I'll be staying in Fitzroy, close to Brunswick st.

1. Would love your recommendations and thoughts on what's a must to see and eat. My tentative plans are breakfast at **Alimentari**, a walk around the area exploring the ambience (including Gertrude st., town hall, Carlton gardens), lunch at **Pony White Cafe** (is it a good spot for lunch?), afternoon coffee and pastries at **Lune**, evening drinks at **Naked for Satan**, and no idea about dinner. Recommendation for dinner (no dietary restrictions or preferences). Anything I need to know about these places? Dress code, etc.? 
2. I will land early morning (6AM) on a Monday. Is Uber recommended as a transport from and to MEL airport? Is it more or less recommended than a regular taxi? I'm less sensitive to price, I care most about having the safest and simplest option.

1ot9sgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stonerfood/comments/1ot9sgz/hi_all_i_want_to_share_my_experience_with_gummies/,Hi all I want to share my experience with gummies.  Relative newb (10 months of gummie use since last smoked it 25 years ago),"Im 49 male.  Good health.  So I'm pretty sure my gummies are from a strong thc yield and sativa strain. I stopped smoking cannabis 29 years ago as it started making me anxious.  Recently I tried gummies as got soooooo bored with alcohol (social drinker never had an alcohol problem.)  They are 25mg.  Half of one consumed with high fat and sugary food (personally I like yogurt) beforehand has me a very non drowsy and energised totally euphoric body and brain buzz for up to about 10 hours.  Same buzz and duration after 10 months on same amount (12.5mg 25mg.)   It's amazing for me.  Music sounds AMAZING like hearing it for the first time like it's music x 1000.  Each sound or note is like it was played by an angel lol and like a diamond and other gemstones slipping silkily and lovingly into my ears. Don't get me started on what Bob Marley does for me lol.  Gummies for me it's soooooo close to a mild psychedelic buzz.  I also get a wonderful body feeling like so relaxed and bodily euphoric, very sensual.  Muscles I didn't even know existed relax. Stroking my own body feels amazing. It's so Interesting as it can go 2 ways depending on my mood.  If I'm tired and just want to chill it makes me listen to music for hours (my usual alt / indie rock and grunge music seems to 'aggressive so I end up listening to reggae ha ha which I swear was made to be heard high or things like daft punk or other dance music.   The former will make me mellow trip out the latter especially daft punk (I swear they wrote that music to be heard high lol) will literally have the music enter my ears and spin colours and cool visuals in my mind BODY (lol) and even around me :D.  I'll really crave cups of tea (I'm English) like about 5 per hour ha ha and some sugary candy which will be like eating 'food of Gods' :D.  I  want to vape (Fruit flavours 10mg nic) Then I'll sleep (I always do a sleep relaxation with earbuds in b4 bed sober or not) and my sleep meditation will make me super relaxed and euphoric and I'll sleep really well.  No hangover.  OR if I'm feeling sociable I'll go out (with a quite pronounced bouncy walk ha ha) and man it's beautiful. I see everyone as brothers and sisters young and old. The natural world seems sooo beautiful and I feel so non judgemental and anti aggression and if with friends who are drinking they think I'm drunk (i prefer gummies to alcohol they're all conservative so I pretend there's a shot of booze in my cola or my mocktail is a cocktail) and I REALLY ENJOY THEIR COMPANY even more than usual.  If friends aren't around I'll literally (something I never usually do) go to a pub and literally circulate and talk to EVERYONE in the pub for hours ha ha!  I will not like being around 'aggro' or darker personality types though and be polite but then strategically distance from them.  I'll see them as brothers  and sisters who are just stuck in a negative outlook and hope for them they get healthier.  Then I walk home and sleep amazing.  Oh it's also a massive aphrodisiac for me too lol (for whatever reason only gummies not smoking weed or even using the exact same oil from sane company that uses it to make the gummies not in gummies. I think its because I don'tlike smoke full stop.)   I will note I approach it and any substance carefully as a 'psyconaut'.  After taking 12.5 or very occasionally 25mg if going to a music festival (Oh. My. God.) With a large helping of yogurt and a strong hot cup of tea (I swear the hot tea makes it kick in faster and better and we all know that the fat in the yogurt does too) after the gummie I always do a 40 to 60 minute mindfulness, mindful self-compassion meditation or a yoga nidra meditation LYING DOWN in my nice comfy bed.   I have very positive affirmations I use (I love myself whole heartedly and I accept myself just as I am and with the compassion I deserve / I am relaxing deeply now and am cultivating calmness and I protect my inner peace/ may I be happy, may I be healthy, may I be peaceful and may I be free.') I think that's why I feel so positive when it kicks in and also euphoric as my mind,  nervous system and body and endorphins are in an optimal and good state. Also I think this is why I manage to maintain a low tolerance as I am setting things up to maximally absorb the thc to not need a lot and 'make a little go a long way' and be in a great mindset (I only do gummies about 4-5 times a month and have no cravings or need for habitual use. I think that's because I'm quite spiritual and have good mental health and do daily meditation etc and love it, have done 8 week mbsr and 8 week mindful self-compassion courses and previous therapy.)  I have had a bit of paranoia at first the first couple of times but I found if I just say to myself 'this is only a substance reaction because it's not socially accepted like alcohol is so you feel outside the herd and you're not actually paranoid life is good and this is a natural plant so enjoy it and sod the men in suits and anyone else who doesn't like it' it goes away even in a crowded festival literally immediately.  I have no idea why but I have the same oil the gummies are made from and do the same exact things when taking it (I'll sublingual then swallow with both) but get more of a groggy feeling later (though the other aspects of the high are similar) and a next day mild hangover improved by a few coffees and a cold shower for same amount of cannabis. No hangover with gummies. For some odd reasons gummies work best for me and the high is so much more 'up' and with more clarity.  Laying on the leather sofa with eyes shut the colours and visuals are soo good and I melt into the sofa.  I sell jewelry on Ebay so look at and photograph gems a lot and so my brain uses what's there in my memory I guess and often gives me amazing morphing gemstones visuals of the most amazing colours and vividness) at a music festival I love the  crowds and music soooooo much.  It's so good I honestly at first thought the company who makes them had put a low dose of MDMA in them which I've tried 4 times in my life from 18 yrs old to 35 - I'm now 49.  I can say with certainty they don't though but it sure feels like it a bit :D.  As I said I've taken gummies before going to outdoors music events and the only words that do it justice is OMG.  I tried cocaine a few times in my search for a new 'alcohol alternative' (same post intake rituals)  but except the first couple of times it's painful on nose and tbh boring compared to gummies so boring and just makes you obsessed with itself lol.  I love gummies :D. Mine are full delta 9.  They are good lol.  Once took 2 halves before a music festival (same post ingestion rituals before going out) and then forgot I'd taken the 2nd half so did another lol and that 37.5mg had me like a mix of light mushroom and mdma buzz for 13 hours.  That time I did want to get away from the crowd and even my friends from time to time (not in a negative way I just wanted a bit of peaceful alone time) and just sit in the lotus position lol and watch the sky trees and birds) and end of festival (a 1pm to 1am very family friendly festival) I did feel very tired but I had danced and sung along for hours Ha ha. Peace.  It really is all about mindset that you bring to it I feel.  I don't like smoking it as kicks too quick and I hate the dirty feeling of smoke in my body (ex cigarette smoker going on 6.5 years yay me.) ",0,1762768451.0,stonerfood,1,0.5,False

1ot9mh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mushrooms/comments/1ot9mh7/foraging_police_patrol_crime_fighter_article/,Foraging police patrol crime fighter article,"In The Netherlands, removing complete forests is not a problem. But taking  mushroom out of a forest is criminal.

(names changed)  
**Foraging Frenzy**  
Porcini, bay bolete, beefsteak fungus — for the forager, the forest in autumn is a food paradise. Nature organizations, however, are far from pleased about the growing popularity of mushroom picking, which is banned in the Netherlands. *The Daily Chronicle* joined a mushroom patrol in the wooded hills outside a midland city.

The coffee machine sputters early in a storage shed near an old airfield. Three men in green ranger uniforms prepare for their morning patrol across the former military site, now managed by a regional conservation trust. “It’s still quiet in the woods right now — exactly when foragers like to head out,” says Rick (55) of the Regional Environmental Enforcement Agency, which monitors environmental compliance.

During a large enforcement operation a few weeks earlier, Rick caught someone around 9:30 a.m. who had already gathered about 13 kilos of mushrooms. In total, 36.5 kilos were confiscated that day. Now, just before 8:30, Rick, his colleague Adam (54), and Matt (21) from the conservation trust climb into their green jeeps for a patrol. Because of the sensitivity of their work, the rangers prefer not to use their full names.

Their route this Saturday morning passes several “hotspots” where foragers are often found. In the Netherlands, mushroom picking is illegal, though some national forest agencies tolerate a small “grocery box” of up to 250 grams. In this region, enforcement is stricter. Walkers may pick up small natural items found on paths, but not pluck or step off the trails.

Outside the jeep, the sun burns away the morning mist, turning the forest into a red-gold tapestry. “Porcini and bay bolete are the most popular,” says Matt. “People pick them to eat.” He himself isn’t a fan of mushrooms, he adds with a laugh when Adam begins describing how to brush them clean before cooking. “I don’t like the texture.”

**The Foraging Hype**  
Many others clearly do. “In recent years, foraging has become a craze,” he says. Whether that has led to more enforcement, he can’t say. In the past, confiscations weren’t always recorded in detail. But, Adam adds, “Nine years ago, rangers would joke about mushroom patrols. Now that there’s more understanding of their ecological importance, people take it seriously.”

The hype, Matt explains, comes from a desire to eat “straight from nature,” free from cultivated pesticides. Influencers promote foraging on social media or offer workshops. Eastern European migrant workers have also taken up the practice — in countries like Poland and the Czech Republic, mushroom picking is a family tradition, with whole households returning from the woods carrying baskets full.

The rangers avoid commenting on the background of those they catch; they don’t want to “label” anyone. To them, all are “offenders” who harm the ecosystem. That may sound harsh for what seems a minor infraction, but the impact is real, Matt says. “Animals like squirrels and insects feed on mushrooms. They also decompose dead wood and leaves, and their fungal networks connect to trees and plants. When you remove a mushroom, you remove its spores — and weaken the forest.”

In the restricted quiet zone of the airfield reserve, it’s peaceful except for a few chirping birds. Visitors aren’t allowed here, and today even the foragers seem to stay away. Farther along, the jeep passes two walkers resting on a bench overlooking a grassy pit where sand was once mined. Adam and Matt lower the window. “Good morning.”

**Dirty Hands**  
They see no reason to stop and check the walkers’ bags. Rangers need a clear cause before searching anyone’s belongings, they explain. “If you see someone off the trail with a small bag, you can usually guess what’s inside,” says Matt. “They’ll have a knife for cutting the mushrooms — and dirty hands.”

It looks like a quiet morning, until they reach the busier Pinewood Park. Suddenly, action. Four cars are ticketed for illegal parking, and two women are fined for letting their dogs run loose. Rick stops a visitor to explain that cargo bikes aren’t allowed in the area. “During a patrol, you always come across other issues,” the men had warned earlier.

A little later, Adam brakes as he spots a row of mushrooms by the path. With help from a plant-identification app, the rangers determine it’s the funnel-shaped clouded agaric — edible when well cooked, said to taste like chicken. A white mold already spreads over the caps. “In a week they’ll be gone,” Adam says. Returned to dust.

These are the final days he expects to find any mushroom pickers in the woods. By mid-November, the cold sets in and the edible species vanish. But the foragers themselves, he says, will never disappear. “Next up are the moss collectors — for Christmas wreaths.”",1,1762767824.0,Mushrooms,1,1.0,False
1ot9mg6,https://i.redd.it/elxy4jwkhe0g1.jpeg,Building Healthy Habits: Overcoming Mental Barriers in Daily Nutrition,"**Understanding common challenges in sticking to your diet and how data-driven insights can guide lasting lifestyle changes**

Keeping up with healthy eating sounds simple in theory — just make good choices, right? But anyone who’s ever tried to eat well every day knows it’s not that easy. Life gets messy, motivation fades, and even the best intentions can fall apart somewhere between a busy morning and a late-night snack.

The challenge isn’t a lack of knowledge. Most of us already know what we *should* eat. What makes it hard is what happens in our minds: the guilt after a slip-up, the pressure to do everything perfectly, the all-or-nothing thinking that creeps in when things don’t go exactly as planned.

Recognizing these mental hurdles is just as important as understanding nutrition itself. Once you see what’s really holding you back, it’s possible to make changes that actually stick — without adding stress.

Sometimes it starts with the familiar thought: “I’ll start again tomorrow.” Missing a meal or giving in to a craving can make it feel like a failure. Guilt sneaks in, and your inner voice whispers, “Forget it. I’ll start over tomorrow.”

But progress doesn’t vanish because of one imperfect day. What really helps is seeing your habits over time, not just judging single moments. Tracking trends over a week or a month — even in small ways — can show that you’re moving forward. One choice doesn’t define your journey, and noticing that is empowering.

It’s easy to fall into the trap of focusing too much on numbers. Calories, steps, or macros can feel like the measure of success — and that can turn food from nourishment into stress. Paying attention to nutrients like protein, fiber, and vitamins gives a fuller picture of how your body actually feels. This kind of tracking is less about punishment and more about awareness. When you understand how your choices affect your energy and mood, making better decisions becomes natural.

Another challenge is inconsistency. “I’ll log it later” often turns into never, breaking the flow of a new habit. But tracking doesn’t have to be tedious or time-consuming. Quick entries, gentle reminders, or even short notes can keep you engaged. Over time, noticing your own patterns — how meals, hydration, and energy interact — makes tracking rewarding rather than a chore.

Perfectionism can quietly sabotage progress too. Trying to capture every detail exactly might seem disciplined, but it often leads to burnout. Even rough notes — “chicken salad,” “two coffees,” “snack: nuts” — tell you valuable things about your habits. The point isn’t perfect tracking; it’s consistent self-awareness.

Feedback is what keeps motivation alive. Logging meals can feel pointless if you don’t see any results. Visualizing patterns — how what you eat affects your energy, mood, or focus — helps you understand what works for *you*. This isn’t about judging good or bad choices; it’s about noticing what supports your life and what doesn’t.

Healthy eating doesn’t require perfection — it thrives on awareness. Each meal you log, each small reflection, each little win, helps you notice patterns and make choices that stick. Over time, these tiny observations add up, forming habits that feel natural instead of forced.

In our experience at Chatviva, the simplest awareness often leads to the most lasting change. It isn’t about strict diets, rigid rules, or quick fixes. It’s about noticing the small patterns of your life — how your meals, energy, and moods connect — and using those insights to make choices that feel right for you.

Healthy habits aren’t built in one perfect week. They grow quietly, one mindful meal at a time. Every time you jot down a meal, mark how you’re feeling, or pause to reflect, you’re learning something new about yourself. Gradually, these little steps build habits that are sustainable, not stressful. Health becomes less about following rules and more about understanding your own rhythms, day by day.

1ot9mde,https://www.reddit.com/r/LahoreSocial/comments/1ot9mde/30_days_30_ideas_day_14_the_tribe_effect/,30 Days. 30 Ideas (Day 14)- The Tribe Effect,"At a coffee shop, two people were waiting for their orders and casually talking about random stuff.

One placed an iPhone on the counter.



The other noticed and said, "" Oh nice, AirDrop will actually work if we need to share something.""



Within seconds, they were talking about storage issues, camera quality, and other phone- related stuff.



They did not know each other.

They did not exchange names.

Their entire connection formed around a product.



That is the Tribe Effect.



Psychologist Henri Tajfel in Social Identity Theory said that we naturally identify with groups and use them to define who we are.

Later, Seth Godin turned this into a marketing idea in “Tribes,” showing that people don’t follow products, they follow communities.



Hence, 



People do not connect through logic.

They connect through identity.



We tell ourselves we are being rational.

We compare prices.

We watch reviews.

We make lists of pros and cons.



But deep down, most choices are not about the product.

They are about belonging to a group that says,



""You think like us.""

  


You can see it online too.



Spend five minutes on Reddit and you will notice how fast people form micro communities.

Someone posts a meme on r/Android roasting iPhone users.

Within minutes, hundreds of strangers jump in to defend or attack a brand they did not even build.

It is not about phones.

It is about identity.

It is about picking a side and protecting the tribe.



Even perfumes have tribes in Pakistan.



Mention J. and  it signals subtle, eastern, nostalgic scents.

Mention Dior Sauvage or Bleu de Chanel, and suddenly the identity becomes premium, polished, western leaning.



Different brands.

Same psychology.

  


Here is the catch!



Brands know this.

They design for it.

It is not accidental.

It is a marketing tactic.



They do not sell products.

They sell identity.

They sell belonging.

They sell a tribe.



Because when something reflects who we think we are, or who we want to be, we do not just buy it.

We defend it.



Takeaway:

Marketing is not about making people buy.

It is about making people belong.

Belonging sells more than features ever will.

  
We pretend we make logical decisions, but our buying habits expose us every time.

What tribe are you in: “I researched for 3 months” or “I bought it in 3 seconds”?

So I (30m) had been dating this girl (let's call her J) for 2 months and honestly it felt different from anything before, it wasn't the firework type feeling but I just felt immediately comfortable with her and being myself, it was always a question of when we would see each other again not if. It wasn't just me making effort, she planned dates and put in effort. She had told her family about me early on and I ended up meeting them at her sporting event after 2 months.

It went really well and she asked me to join them for dinner afterwards and before I could answer her mum insisted I join. It all went well and seemed to be a good vibe, her mum hugging me and saying hopefully see me at her next match etc. then when I went to speak to J about our evening plans (she had suggested her coming to mine for wine and board games/films) she then ended it saying she had decided it felt more like friendship, which felt strange as 2 dates previous she stayed at mine after I made her dinner and that definitely wasn't friend vibes. It kind of felt like she was just coming up with a reason and didn't mean it.

I tried to talk to her about it but I was still processing it and in the end we just had to leave and I reached out to ask her if we could talk but she shut it down completely.

I knew I needed to give her space but we continued to follow each other on Instagram and she was viewing all my stories up until a week ago where she suddenly stopped part way through. Anyway I had decided after a month I would drop off a card at her home (whilst she was at work) with some coffee just to wish her the best with the season properly starting to show whilst I was carrying on with life I still cared about her and I know how much she liked little gestures like that. However she then blocked me on Instagram that evening.

I'm just a bit in shock about the whole thing given she was the one who wanted me to meet her family and the dinner went great. Have had friends read our messages from the week leading up to it and there were no signs at all. The evening before she was saying how she had wine in the fridge and was asking how my dinner with friends went etc.

I know I can't reach out to her now via WhatsApp etc as she has set a clear boundary, and as I care for her I need to respect that. But just don't know what to do given the way I felt about her, it felt so different to anything I had experienced before and even started to see a therapist as didn't want any past trauma to impact what we had.

First time posting on here, hoping you all can help me out.

Possibly in search of a unicorn - looking for a machine that ticks all the below, and is available in Australia:

\* must have auto milk frother (this is main reason for upgrading from our current manual machine). We only drink lattes/flat whites; with the VERY occasional espresso here and there

\* easy to clean; must have either an auto-clean cycle or be dishwasher safe

\* either very quiet operation (ie won't wake my sleeping toddler) or ability to use pre-ground

\* makes HOT coffee - I often don't get to drink all of my coffee straight away (due to aforementioned toddler/ morning rush getting ready for work) so need it to be super-hot when it's first made.

\* as hands-free / minimal steps as possible

He hit me with the classic “we’re not compatible” and “we took things too fast,” just two weeks after saying I was his everything. He told me he was in love with me less than a month in. The chemistry, the conversations, the humor  it all felt perfect at the time. 

After the breakup, I made the mistake of giving in when he wanted to sleep together again because I thought maybe things would change. We broke up in March 2024, and I didn’t let anyone else touch me until September because I still felt loyal to him. The last time I saw him was December 2024. The next morning he told me, “You should move on, this is toxic.” Which was crazy, considering I never reached out first. Not once! 

It’s now November 2025. I haven’t seen him in almost a year, but every few months he circles back. Same story: “Just checking in,” fishing for details about my love life, throwing in sexual comments, then asking to meet up to hook up, not even wanting to see me for a coffee. I always decline.

But this last time I flipped the script. I told him I’d been seeing someone briefly, someone with the same name as him (different spelling, thanks universe). That alone annoyed him, but then I dropped the real bomb. His ego has always been tied to being the best I ever had in bed, until his name twin beat his record.

He lost it. He asked how many times, how long, and tried to play it off with lines like, “Easy,” “Doable,” “Until someone beats his record,” and even, “I have a great d**k.” Desperate damage control.

He thought I’d always keep him on a pedestal. Since he turned what we had into nothing but sex, and kept fishing, I decided to give him something to chew on.

Will he come back to try reclaiming his title (not happening by the way) or crawl back into hiding to nurse his ego? Who knows.

Just thought I’d share this for anyone who still believes their ex will change. They don’t. They never do.",4,1762767503.0,AvoidantBreakUps,2,1.0,False

MIL bought book about poisons and put it on display in the kitchen. Offered us her ""homemade herb blend"" and started talking about her book about about poisons right in that moment. Her husband quipped ""I asked her if she was trying to kill me"" and laughed. I asked her if I have anything to worry about jokingly, she answered ""No, I'm drinking it too"". Proceeded to talk about ways you can prepare fly amanita for tea.

She has a history of abusing her children severely and often threatened to kill them when they were kids.

Past infringements:  
1.) Always talking about fiance's childhood female friends emphasizing how they're single and in prestigious careers. Never talks about male friends (99% of his friends) or married female friends.  
2.)Time before last we were there she went into our room while we were drinking morning coffee in the kitchen. We hadn't yet made the bed. Threw half our things on the ground to ""get to her sewing machine"", invited a random relative who was in the house into our private room. It basically looked like a pig sty with our items flung about randomly.

Situation:  
I can't not see her, won't explain in detail here, it's just what it is.  
I can and do see her very rarely and will further limit that time.  
What I'm looking for is ways to stop this behaviour which don't lead to a direct dramatic confrontation because she is very unhinged if you didn't get that already from this post.

UPDATE:  
Talked to my fiance. ""She's just joking, she often threatens to kill all of us, chill out"".  
""But she can't jokingly threaten me. I don't care what you find normal.""  
""We'll talk about it when I come home""

Honestly, I'm starting to reconsider the entire relationship if he continues to defend her. He both claims she's insane and violent and that a person like that joking about killing someone is normal. His brother does similar things (not directed at me), has BPD and is hoarding weapons in his room he still lives in in the home of his mom. He's always in spats with her and she keeps threatening to have him committed.

Her goal is obviously to drive me away so she can continue torturing him more frequently.

Norwegians are genuinely *good* drivers. Like, alarmingly competent. You’re cruising along, thinking, “These people grew up driving on ice in their Volvo 240 with studded tyres, they must have Viking blood that knows exactly how to handle a car.” And they do! They’re so calm; so steady; so considerate. They drive like they’re delivering crown jewels, and every pothole is a national security threat.

But then… *then*… something happens at the motorway on-ramp. It’s like their entire genetic memory evaporates.

Every Norwegian suddenly forgets what the accelerator is. You’re behind them thinking, “Alright, here we go—time to merge, let’s get up to speed,” and the person in front of you is happily toodling along at 50 km/h like they’re on their way to drop off a basketful of waffles at grandma’s.

I swear, they hit that on-ramp and go, “You know what? I’m going to take my sweet, sweet time. And if I die, I die.”

Meanwhile behind them? It turns into a chain-reaction panic attack. Every car is doing that rapid-fire brake-tap like they’re trying to send Morse code for “SAVE ME.” Someone drops their coffee, someone else is clutching the dash like they’ve just seen Jesus in the rear-view mirror. It’s absolute pandemonium.

I don’t know if this is a cultural thing or just a stubborn refusal to accept basic physics — but listen up Norge: that pedal on the right is there for a *reason.* Speed is your *friend* on the on-ramp.

Me: happily married, kids, House, essentially white picket Fence… all is good, but I find it hard harder and harder to stay in contact with friends. Everybody is just so busy… hence, why I am here.

I read a lot, mainly crime fiction or epic fantasy things. I am always open to recommendations of any genre if you read something great recently? I love a good show to binge, and slow horses is definitely the show for me at the moment, but I have started the new Robin Hood TV show and it is okay… I think. Maybe I will stick with it.

You: interested and chatty. I have had too many conversations where people reply with one word, and it leaves me wondering why they bothered to text me in the first place. 

If you’re interested, shoot me a message and we can have a coffee and talk about anything and everything! ",1,1762766523.0,MakeFriendsOver30,2,1.0,False
1ot99kv,https://i.redd.it/iq4zfnqjde0g1.jpeg,"“Life on Pause, Dreams on Play: Inside the UPSC Aspirant’s FOMO Zone”","Every UPSC aspirant secretly knows this truth. While the world is out there sipping cold coffee in cafes, attending destination weddings, and getting promoted, they are stuck in a parallel universe ruled by Laxmikanth, Spectrum, and The Hindu.

According to an informal baat-cheet conducted during chai breaks, 8 out of 10 aspirants admit they often feel like life is passing them by. Their friends are sharing stories of foreign trips and pay hikes, while they’re stuck deciding whether to attempt Question 7(b) in the Mains paper or skip it for lack of time.

This fear of missing out isn’t just emotional, it’s existential. It’s the thought that everyone else is living, while they’re preparing to live. Birthday parties turn into guilt trips, Netflix becomes a rare luxury, and weekends feel like myths from a forgotten era. The irony? The same people who once teased them for “studying too much” now ask for tips on productivity and time management.

But amidst the chaos, there’s quiet pride. Because deep down, every aspirant knows they’re not running behind the crowd, they’re walking a lonelier, harder path that could one day lead to the power to change lives. So yes, the FOMO is real, but so is the dream.

And someday, when the results are out, the world will scroll past another “party pic,” while the aspirant signs their first official file.

1ot991c,https://news.met.police.uk/news/met-police-arrest-more-than-140-people-in-crime-crackdown-in-londons-west-end-503130,Met Police arrest more than 140 people in crime crackdown in London's West End,"The Metropolitan Police Service has made more than 140 arrests during a crackdown on crime and anti-social behaviour in London’s West End.

More than 100 additional officers were deployed as part of Operation Baselife, a week-long intelligence-led operation tackling offences such as shoplifting, phone theft, violence against women and girls and other anti-social behaviour.

The operation is part of increased police activity in the West End and other London crime hotspots over autumn and winter, as the Met continues to relentlessly target prolific offenders.

Among those arrested were two phone thieves operating at an ice rink in Leicester Square, a prolific upskirter who covertly filmed women as they queued for the bathroom in a coffee shop, and two men caught driving a stolen vehicle around Paddington.

Superintendent Natasha Evans, who led the Met’s operation in London’s West End, said: “This operation shows that targeting prolific offenders in crime hotspots works. Our intelligence-led approach means we’re solving twice as many shoplifting cases and taking hundreds of offenders off the streets.

“Through this intensified action, we are continuing to ensure the West End remains a safe and welcoming place for residents, businesses and the millions of visitors who come here each month.

“We’re doubling down before Christmas, as the West End enters one of its busiest periods. Local officers, specialist teams and tech such as Live Facial Recognition will focus on the areas with the most crime to keep driving numbers down.

“Our officers continue to tackle crimes that matter most to Londoners through highly visible, intelligence-led policing that builds trust in our communities.”

Operation Baselife – which began on Monday, 3 November – brought together the Met, local authorities and partner organisations to tackle crime in the West End through a structured and intelligence-led approach.

During this period of action, officers worked at specific times and places where offences were most likely to occur. Both uniformed and covert teams worked to target prolific offenders.

Officers were supported by specialist teams such as “interceptors” who largely target robberies and thefts involving cars, mopeds, Surrons and e-bikes. The Marine Policing Unit also carried out patrols along the River Thames.

Between 1 April and 29 October, officers achieved promising reductions in several types of crime in the West End compared to the same period last year:

    Neighbourhood crime down by 20.7 per cent 

    Knife crime down by 22.3 per cent 

    Personal robbery down 14.1 per cent 

    Theft from a person down 23.7 per cent 

    Theft from vehicle down 19 per cent 

    Vehicle offences down 13.7 per cent 

Crime is falling across London. Between 1 April and 29 October, neighbourhood offences such as theft, robbery and vehicle crime were down nearly 15 per cent compared to the same period last year. Officers are arresting around 1,000 more criminals every month compared to last year. The Met has also solved 92 per cent more shoplifting cases this year.

Examples of the types of arrests made during Operation Baselife’s week-long intensification period include:

    On Tuesday, 4 November two men were arrested after covert officers observed them trying to steal mobile phones from women at an ice rink in Leicester Square. Officers searched the men and found several stolen phones on them. Officers reunited one of the phones with its owner.

    On Wednesday, 5 November covert officers arrested a suspect for an upskirting offence. The man was caught standing behind two women covertly filming their buttocks as they waited for the bathroom in a coffee shop in Soho. Officers seized the man’s phone and discovered a significant number of similar videos taken around London.

    On Thursday, 6 November officers identified a black Nissan Juke driving with cloned plates in Paddington. Officers pre-emptively “stung” the car to avoid a pursuit. They did this by deploying a stinger – a belt of spikes that can puncture the tyres of a moving vehicle safely bringing it to a halt. The car was confirmed stolen. The driver and passenger were arrested for theft of a motor vehicle and possession of cannabis with intent to supply. ",53,1762766350.0,london,6,0.96,False

1ot97sy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ot97sy/discussion_brewingbean_apps_ive_tried_or/,"[Discussion] Brewing/bean apps I’ve tried or researched lately: Beanconqueror, Brevv and Roastguide","Sharing notes to help folks pick the right tool for their workflow. Would love to hear what you’re using and why.

# Beanconqueror (iOS & Android)

**What it is:** A free, open-source coffee tracker for beans, brews, gear, and more, popular with folks who want detailed logs and hardware integrations.

**👍 Strengths**

* **Deep device support** (Acaia, Felicita, Hiroia Jimmy, Skale2, Decent, Smart Espresso Profiler, Pressensor, etc.) and live graphs for flow/pressure, great for espresso profiling. 
* **Free & open-source** with active development (recent v8 release), and **multilingual**.
* **Tracks caffeine to Apple Health** and covers the whole journey from green to cup.

**👎 Trade-offs**

* **Utility-first UI** powerful, but there’s a learning curve versus simpler “set it and forget it” timers. (Inference based on scope of features.) 
* **Setup time** is longer if you want full device connectivity and detailed schemas.

# Brevv (iOS & Android)

**What it is:** A pour-over–focused app that scans your coffee bag, pulls origin/roast info, and generates AI-assisted brew recipes with step-by-step timers (V60, Chemex, Kalita, AeroPress, etc.).

**👍 Strengths**

* **Bag scanning + auto bean details** keeps your log tidy with minimal typing.
* **AI-generated recipes** that adapt to your preferences; nice for dialing in a new single origin without guesswork.
* **Clear, guided timers** geared toward consistent pour-over results.

**👎 Trade-offs**

* **Newer app/ecosystem** → fewer integrations and less community data compared with long-running trackers.
* **Pour-over centric** espresso nerds may outgrow it quickly.

# Roastguide (iOS & Android)

**What it is:** A giant specialty coffee catalog (40k+ roasts from 1k+ roasters), personalized recommendations, tasting notes, brew logs, and community features.

**👍 Strengths**

* **Massive, frequently updated catalog** awesome for discovering new roasters and tracking what you like.
* **Personalized recs + community reviews** help you spot patterns in your preferences.
* **Brewing logs + step-by-step guides** baked in, so you can go from “found it” to “brewed it” in one place.

**👎 Trade-offs**

* **Discovery-first** focus may be overkill if you only need a dead-simple timer/log.
* **Unclear hardware integrations** if you need Bluetooth scales/graphs, Beanconqueror is more proven here.

# TL;DR / Who should use what?

* You want fast, guided pour-overs with minimal setup: **Brevv**
* You obsess over data, devices, and repeatability (especially espresso): **Beanconqueror**
* You love exploring new roasters + journaling in one place: **Roastguide**

Someone warns the trucker not to eat the apple pie, they realize that once you take a bite you never want to leave, and all the patrons are trapped here.

It’s been 4 months since we broke up, you have a new gf and are now across the world from me. Tonight tho, I can’t get you out of my mind. It hurts just like it did at the very beginning of the break up and I don’t know why 4 months later this is hitting again.

Over the past 4 months so much has happened (like A TON of stuff) and slowly but surely recovering from the break up. Yes I broke up with you, so me missing you is sorta silly and you have a new lady. I miss you tho. Missing you is a lil silly because looking back I understand even more why we didn’t work together. Maybe it is because the storm in my life (that started around the time of the break up) has finally started to settle down- that in the quiet and peace, and in the healing of my life’s story- I’m missing you.

I’m praying for your safety so much, it’s true sometime we have to walk away from people we love. I never stoped caring about you. Breaking up with you broke my heart, it sucked because i didn’t want to but I knew it wasn’t going to work between us, and I wanted to set you free before you left, so I tried to do it sooner rather than later which ended up in me breaking my own heart even worse finding out you had a new gf.

That did make it a lil easier to let go of you tho, knowing you had a new girl. I don’t know why tonight this hurts so bad, 4 months later. I really hope you’re okay. So much has changed and happened in the past 4 months, I want to say I wish you were here but like I said I know we would not have worked out in the long run, communication between 2 avoidants isn’t the easiest situation but we tried our best. We were polar opposites but we had so much in common. Looking back I see many reasons why we didn’t work. It doesn’t help the fact I still miss you. Maybe it is the nostalgia of you or the fact you felt safe. Your love terrified me to be honest but i shouldn’t have been scared and that is something i need to work thru on my end. And I’m sorry i blew up when i found out you had a new gf.

I broke up with you and asked you for clarity for a month by blowing up your phone which is crazy and I’m not the type of person to normally do that, but between my TBI and the reason I broke up with you being lack of communication and clarity- then afterwards still no clarity, I know it was wrong. I just could not and still do not understand. I apologize for the harsh words I said after the break up, I should have controlled my tounge but I was so confused between the TBI and the lack of clarity, that is still is no excuse. I’m sorry, I was just trying to make sense in my head of what happened, thinking of literally any logical explanation why things happened the way they did, I couldn’t figure it out and still cant but God has everything happen for a reason.

But it’s okay, you have a new lady, you moved on plus your dealing with a lot right now and I am insignificant, just a spec, in your life (or was in your life) but that’s okay because I am still praying for you. I can’t lie, our break up is was one of the worst I’ve had, I still am not even remotely interested in dating and I have tried putting myself out there and it wasn’t worth it.

I miss the car rides, getting coffee in the morning (I looked forward to it every day- it was the highlight), listening to music, playing video games, meeting your friends (even if I was completely out of place and didn’t fit in your friend group), when we went to NH (I’m glad you convinced me to go, I was terrified and didn’t want to, but it was so worth it and I had so much fun), how you helped me grow in so many ways, I miss Oden (I apologize if I spelt his name wrong), i miss swimming with you, i miss watching you play guitar and when we would jam together while I played the drums, I miss the walks in nature and you would always find a new place, I miss learning all the things you would teach me, I miss when you would do the rain drops on my head to calm my head down. How we fought so hard to make this work. Whenever I had attempted to leave you would say “no, we are going to figure this out” and that made my heart cry on the inside feeling loved. Maybe you just told me what I wanted to hear? I still don’t understand, I’m sorry. The future I thought we would have was gone in the blink of an eye even tho, yes, I broke up with you but I didn’t want to, it was more of I didn’t have a choice. I couldn’t cling on to you and let our love grow for a year while you would be gone, I tried to do what was best and set you free even if it ment breaking both of our hearts, if it helps at all it tore me to pieces but I did it for the best for both of us.

Remember Sarg to stay strong, you need to make it home for your son. I don’t know how it is going over there or where you are, but I am praying so much for your safety. I’m worried so bad about you, but I need to release the fears into God’s hands, there is nothing I can do to help you except pray.

I don’t even know your thoughts or opinions, still no clarity on any of it, and I don’t know how it is going over there. Maybe you hate me for all of it, but with the faith of a mustard seed I’m going to hope you know I didn’t mean anything bad out of it and I really did love you and care about you. I was confused and I know blowing up was wrong and I’m sorry. I’ve just kind of accepted that the no-clarity is clarity that you’ve exited my life for good.

I don’t know if you got my text I sent a bit ago, I had to delete my profile after I sent it, if you read the text then you would understand why.

I doubt it will ever happen, but just to talk to you as a friend not even to get back together, I miss your talking to you, and you felt like a warm blanket of comfort, a safe place to run to. You made me feel like someone cared. I think you know how to reach me but I highly doubt you will- but in case you ever do I think you know how to get a hold of me.

Btw you might like this song, it makes me think of us. “Shelter” -Fit for a King

May God protect you and shelter you under his almighty wings, casting angels to guide you in all your ways. In a way this is sort of me releasing you into God’s hands, which you have always been in God’s hands, you were never technically “mine” to begin with. But my fears of how you are doing, that is only in God’s control, all I can do is pray. Stay strong Sarg and never give up! I will always care about you no matter what, deal with it big dawg :3

2. Use L'oreal Colour Riche Lipstick in neutral bronze-gold pearl shade Bronze Coin ($10 on CVS, $8 on Amazon and Walmart) on the unshaded area of your lips. As needed, blend the lip liner shading and lipstick color together with your lip brush or back of the lip liner for a cohesive gradient.

3. Use LA Colors Shea Butter High Shine Gloss in warm bronze coffee shimmer shade Snuggle (smells like a caramel cafe latte) swiped about 2-3 times on the center of your bottom lip and press your bottom lip with your top lip a couple of times for a glassy cool-toned chocolate gradient finish ($2 on Amazon, on their website, or your local beauty shop).

1ot92dz,https://youtu.be/-GZDcyepXeA?si=b5JSvDe7-0BQ6ifg,Thru “hell or high water”,"You will probably never see this, but I need to deposit this into the void. It’s been 4 months since we broke up, you have a new gf and are now across the world from me. Tonight tho, I can’t get you out of my mind. It hurts just like it did at the very beginning of the break up and I don’t know why 4 months later this is hitting again. 

Over the past 4 months so much has happened (like A TON of stuff) and slowly but surely recovering from the break up. Yes I broke up with you, so me missing you is sorta silly and you have a new lady. I miss you tho. Missing you is a lil silly because looking back I understand even more why we didn’t work together. 
Maybe it is because the storm in my life (that started around the time of the break up) has finally started to settle down- that in the quiet and peace, and in the healing of my life’s story- I’m missing you. 

I’m praying for your safety so much, it’s true sometime we have to walk away from people we love. I never stoped caring about you. Breaking up with you broke my heart, it sucked because i didn’t want to but I knew it wasn’t going to work between us, and I wanted to set you free before you left, so I tried to do it sooner rather than later which ended up in me breaking my own heart even worse finding out you had a new gf. 

That did make it a lil easier to let go of you tho, knowing you had a new girl. I don’t know why tonight this hurts so bad, 4 months later. I really hope you’re okay. So much has changed and happened in the past 4 months, I want to say I wish you were here but like I said I know we would not have worked out in the long run, communication between 2 avoidants isn’t the easiest situation but we tried our best. We were polar opposites but we had so much in common.
Looking back I see many reasons why we didn’t work. It doesn’t help the fact I still miss you. Maybe it is the nostalgia of you or the fact you felt safe. Your love terrified me to be honest but i shouldn’t have been scared and that is something i need to work thru on my end. And I’m sorry i blew up when i found out you had a new gf. 

I broke up with you and asked you for clarity for a month by blowing up your phone which is crazy and I’m not the type of person to normally do that, but between my TBI and the reason I broke up with you being lack of communication and clarity- then afterwards still no clarity, I know it was wrong. I just could not and still do not understand. I apologize for the harsh words I said after the break up, I should have controlled my tounge but I was so confused between the TBI and the lack of clarity, that is still is no excuse. I’m sorry, I was just trying to make sense in my head of what happened, thinking of literally any logical explanation why things happened the way they did, I couldn’t figure it out and still cant but God has everything happen for a reason.

But it’s okay, you have a new lady, you moved on plus your dealing with a lot right now and I am insignificant, just a spec, in your life (or was in your life) but that’s okay because I am still praying for you. 
I can’t lie, our break up is was one of the worst I’ve had, I still am not even remotely interested in dating and I have tried putting myself out there and it wasn’t worth it. 

I miss the car rides, getting coffee in the morning (I looked forward to it every day- it was the highlight), listening to music, playing video games, meeting your friends (even if I was completely out of place and didn’t fit in your friend group), when we went to NH (I’m glad you convinced me to go, I was terrified and didn’t want to, but it was so worth it and I had so much fun), how you helped me grow in so many ways, I miss Oden (I apologize if I spelt his name wrong), i miss swimming with you, i miss watching you play guitar and when we would jam together while I played the drums, I miss the walks in nature and you would always find a new place, I miss learning all the things you would teach me, I miss when you would do the rain drops on my head to calm my head down. How we fought so hard to make this work. Whenever I had attempted to leave you would say “no, we are going to figure this out” and that made my heart cry on the inside feeling loved. Maybe you just told me what I wanted to hear? I still don’t understand, I’m sorry. The future I thought we would have was gone in the blink of an eye even tho, yes, I broke up with you but I didn’t want to, it was more of I didn’t have a choice. I couldn’t cling on to you and let our love grow for a year while you would be gone, I tried to do what was best and set you free even if it ment breaking both of our hearts, if it helps at all it tore me to pieces but I did it for the best for both of us. 

Remember Sarg to stay strong, you need to make it home for your son. I don’t know how it is going over there or where you are, but I am praying so much for your safety. I’m worried so bad about you, but I need to release the fears into God’s hands, there is nothing I can do to help you except pray. 

I don’t even know your thoughts or opinions, still no clarity on any of it, and I don’t know how it is going over there. Maybe you hate me for all of it, but with the faith of a mustard seed I’m going to hope you know I didn’t mean anything bad out of it and I really did love you and care about you. I was confused and I know blowing up was wrong and I’m sorry. I’ve just kind of accepted that the no-clarity is clarity that you’ve exited my life for good. 

I don’t know if you got my text I sent a bit ago, I had to delete my profile after I sent it, if you read the text then you would understand why. 

I doubt it will ever happen, but just to talk to you as a friend not even to get back together, I miss your talking to you, and you felt like a warm blanket of comfort, a safe place to run to. You made me feel like someone cared. I think you know how to reach me but I highly doubt you will-
but in case you ever do I think you know how to get a hold of me. 

Btw you might like this song, it makes me think of us. “Shelter” -Fit for a King

May God protect you and shelter you under his almighty wings, casting angels to guide you in all your ways. In a way this is sort of me releasing you into God’s hands, which you have always been in God’s hands, you were never technically “mine” to begin with. But my fears of how you are doing, that is only in God’s control, all I can do is pray. Stay strong Sarg and never give up! 
I will always care about you no matter what, deal with it big dawg :3

While the world is out there sipping cold coffee in cafes, attending destination weddings, and getting promoted, they are stuck in a parallel universe ruled by Laxmikanth, Spectrum, and The Hindu. 

According to an informal baat-cheet conducted during chai breaks, 8 out of 10 aspirants admit they often feel like life is passing them by. Their friends are sharing stories of foreign trips and pay hikes, while they’re stuck deciding whether to attempt Question 7(b) in the Mains paper or skip it for lack of time.

This fear of missing out isn’t just emotional, it’s existential. It’s the thought that everyone else is living, while they’re preparing to live. Birthday parties turn into guilt trips, Netflix becomes a rare luxury, and weekends feel like myths from a forgotten era. The irony? The same people who once teased them for “studying too much” now ask for tips on productivity and time management.

But amidst the chaos, there’s quiet pride. Because deep down, every aspirant knows they’re not running behind the crowd, they’re walking a lonelier, harder path that could one day lead to the power to change lives. So yes, the FOMO is real, but so is the dream.

And someday, when the results are out, the world will scroll past another “party pic,” while the aspirant signs their first official file.

I’m getting my new prescription today and I hope that means I don’t have to keep measuring out doses into water and stuff. It’s kind of fun but also I need something I can take quick and easily yknow. 

I’m so sick of everything. I mean I’m not and I am. I’m so sick of myself, I suppose. Things external to me are fine - I mean within my vicinity I suppose considering the world seems to be turning to hell - but it’s me that is definitely the problem. Obviously. News to who? No one. Absolutely no one. 

I saw quails in the garden! 

A young family moved in next door in the rental with awful landlord next to mum and dads this past week, well “young family” they have a 4 year old or something around that age and they’re in their 40’s so whatever that is. I’d still consider that a young family, mum did too. Anyway I’m listening to little snippets of them as they’re outside and over the fence/hedge while I work and it’s so lovely. I think the dad has a long term/fatal illness I can’t remember which one but that’s horribly sad. But back to selfish me, having those little family moments seems so… nice. And I want it. But I don’t. But I do. But I… don’t. Do I? I don’t think so. Little kid laughs are so damn CUTE. Ugggghhhhhhhhh there is 100% always going to be a part of me that wants to be a mother, isn’t there? Yes. Definitely yes. But it’s not 100% of me, and that’s why I can’t in good conscience have a child. You just cannot have a child unless every fibre of your being wants to be a mother 24/7 for the rest of your life, even in the worst possible scenarios. And I don’t want that. What if I had a child with an illness or disabilities? I know I would love them the same no matter what and would put them first, but the fact I find the idea of a healthy and fully abled child daunting and exhausting and too much and that’s with a partner who takes on parenting 50/50… what happens to me if I’m a single mother with a child that needs a lot more hands on care? So. Hm. I know I’m going to not have children, I think in my gut that’s fairly certain - but there’s still a part of me that is fighting that. 

(Nevermind it’s a short time later and the kid is screaming and it sounds like hell - even pups is looking at me like “wtf?” - he literally side eyed me when it started) 

I worked til around 8:30 tonight and didn’t take a lunch break and still managed to not get enough done? So that’s…. great. 

I’m scared about my parents dying. I mean everyone is but I just feel like I’m particularly close with mine in a lot of ways? Close? Reliant? Emotionally dependent? It’s on my mind because mum brought it up because we were talking about dad or something I think because I said he should just do some things and take ownership but then she was saying how his life has shrunk *hugely* since all these back to back illnesses and she even said it’s quite sad, not in a pitying way I don’t think well maybe but just in that.. idk it is quite sad. He still goes out every day even just to get the newspaper or get a coffee at a cafe other days he goes to visit his friends or whatever else. But he’s always been self employed and now he can’t really handle the building management and so mum and my brother are doing a chunk of it - I’m meant to as well/actually be managing the building but I just told them I can’t take it on while I’m still actively trying to sort my head out and I know I always will be but I just idk, not yet. But that will eventually fall to me I guess like tenancy management, rent, lawyers, accountants, council stuff - *yaaaaaaay*. But anyway. So he can’t really do that since his stroke because while his mind still works really well he just can’t do it like he used to. He can still rattle off all sorts of knowledge and stuff like he knows what’s what but I think some of it is just a lot harder to form in his head or communicate. And with his heart he gets out of breath so quickly so he’ll take the dog for a walk but it’s 10-20 minutes tops and he sits down on a bench along the way. And he just isn’t motivated to do a lot, or do it quickly. He has lots of things he wants to do, but getting to actually doing it is the problem. I wonder where I get that from? So. Idk. Mum said he’s not expecting to be around much longer. He may well outlive us all, but yeah. Idk. He’s still very well spirited and things as I was writing this he came into my room here with the dog cracking jokes and stuff as he always does but idk. A part of me has terrible thoughts though. Like, if one of them has to go first it would be easier if it was dad. Not from an emotional standpoint, I’m starting to cry just writing this, but what happens if mum went first? I just don’t see dad being able to realistically live alone. So then what? I move here? Take over organising his medical appointments and going to them with him to take notes like mum does? But if dad went, what does that mean for mum? I know I would come here for the first while, while things settle I guess. But then what? I mean dad has been preparing for this in many ways - selling his old classic Mercedes, selling other antiquey bits of stuff - basically decluttering so she doesn’t have to later. I think she would potentially sell this house and find an apartment back in town somewhere. Or a smaller townhouse because of pups. Part of me feels worried she would move down south as all her family and old friends are there. But the other part of me knows she has me and my brothers family here, but realistically mostly me here. But then I could fly down and visit every month or so - I know she’d always pay for those flights probably. Then again what the hell is keeping me here? This is all Andy aside of course. So. Idk. Losing them terrifies me. I need to stop now because I’m silently sobbing and need to get a grip and go to sleep. Thinking about this makes me feel even worse about my life and how directionless I am. I really need to get a goddamn handle on my life.

I’m playing dog meditation music for pups and he loves it :’)

A while ago I grabbed coffee with a friend. She’s tall, funny, Black, and around my age. I asked her how her last interview went. She laughed and said, “I got the offer, but I didn’t take it.

I laughed and said, “Girl, I get you. I hate those forms too. They’ll see us eventually, so why make us repeat it?”  
She said, “For ‘Race,’ I wrote ‘human.’ For ‘Sex,’ I wrote ‘NO.’ I wasn’t trying to be funny. I just didn’t want to be labeled before they even met me.”

One placed an iPhone on the counter.



The other noticed and said, "" Oh nice, AirDrop will actually work if we need to share something.""



Within seconds, they were talking about storage issues, camera quality, and other phone- related stuff.



They did not know each other.

They did not exchange names.

Their entire connection formed around a product.



That is the Tribe Effect.



Psychologist Henri Tajfel in Social Identity Theory said that we naturally identify with groups and use them to define who we are.

Later, Seth Godin turned this into a marketing idea in “Tribes,” showing that people don’t follow products, they follow communities.



Hence, 



People do not connect through logic.

They connect through identity.



We tell ourselves we are being rational.

We compare prices.

We watch reviews.

We make lists of pros and cons.



But deep down, most choices are not about the product.

They are about belonging to a group that says,



""You think like us.""

  


You can see it online too.



Spend five minutes on Reddit and you will notice how fast people form micro communities.

Someone posts a meme on r/Android roasting iPhone users.

Within minutes, hundreds of strangers jump in to defend or attack a brand they did not even build.

One placed an iPhone on the counter.



The other noticed and said, "" Oh nice, AirDrop will actually work if we need to share something.""



Within seconds, they were talking about storage issues, camera quality, and other phone- related stuff.



They did not know each other.

They did not exchange names.

Their entire connection formed around a product.



That is the Tribe Effect.



Psychologist Henri Tajfel in Social Identity Theory said that we naturally identify with groups and use them to define who we are.

Later, Seth Godin turned this into a marketing idea in “Tribes,” showing that people don’t follow products, they follow communities.



Hence, 



People do not connect through logic.

They connect through identity.



We tell ourselves we are being rational.

We compare prices.

We watch reviews.

We make lists of pros and cons.



But deep down, most choices are not about the product.

They are about belonging to a group that says,



""You think like us.""

Destiny.

It's a movie dialogue, and while I have not been in favor of making a movie out of my life, life has always had different plans. There has been enough drama, emotion, last minute twists, a little action, and even a trickle of romance. At this point, I have accepted that my life will always be dramatic enough to make me jump at 'what's next'.

In this chaos and drama that is life, I am not looking for a pillar of strength or stability, but rather someone who will jump on the chaos alongside me.

I'm looking for that calling, for that someone who will be with me not just for that daily office grind, but also for the spontaneous trip where we go to the wilderness.

So, who is the main character in this story?

**About Me (The ""Daily Grind"" & ""Wilderness""):**

* **The Grind:** By day, my 'daily grind' involves working in sales and business development. It’s a job that keeps me on my toes and involves a lot of strategy and talking to new people (which I genuinely enjoy).



* **The Wilderness:** When I'm not in work mode, I’m all about that ""spontaneous trip."" I’m the kind of person who will *actually* take a solo trip to Goa for a few days, plan a weekend in Pondicherry, or drive the Bangalore-Mysore highway just to find a good restaurant.



* **Interests:** I'm a **vegetarian** and love exploring new food. I'm an avid reader, with a bit of a bad habit of buying a new book on every trip, even when I haven't finished the one from the *last* trip. My bookshelf is a testament to my good intentions.



* I can get lost for hours falling down the rabbit hole of my favorite fandoms (like **Harry Potter** or **Demon Slayer**). On a quieter day, you might find me walking through **Cubbon Park**, enjoying the gentle breeze and maybe even a slight drizzle of rain.



**About You (The ""Co-Star"" I'm Looking For):**

* You're someone between **25-31**.
* You're preferably in or around **Bangalore** so we can actually meet up, grab a coffee, and plan that spontaneous trip (instead of just talking about it).
* You ""get"" the chaos metaphor. You're passionate about your *own* hobbies and can hold a real conversation that bounces from silly to serious.
* You’re a ""yes"" person (within reason!) when it comes to new experiences—whether it's trying a new cuisine, exploring a new part of the city, or just seeing where the day takes us.

**The Call to Action (What's Next?):**

If this sounds like your kind of script, send me a message.

To break the ice, tell me about one of two things: the most spontaneous trip you've ever taken, **or** the last book you bought but haven't started yet.

Looking forward to hearing from you.",1,1762764493.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,0.99,False
1ot8raz,https://i.redd.it/37rd66bd7e0g1.jpeg,Before we forget kindness,"I bought this book without even knowing it was the fifth book in the *Before the Coffee Gets Cold* series —

Reading Before We Forget Kindness truly touched me in a way I didn’t expect. It’s one of those books that quietly enters your heart and leaves you in tears without realizing it. The way Kawaguchi writes about love, loss, and regret felt so real that I couldn’t help but cry while turning the pages. It reminded me how fragile time is — how we often wish to go back, not to change things, but just to say the words we left unsaid or to see someone’s smile one last time.

What struck me most was the message that even though we can’t rewrite the past, we can still choose kindness and forgiveness in the present. Every story in the café showed how people carry pain, yet still search for connection and closure. It made me reflect on my own life — on the moments I took for granted, the people I miss, and the chances I didn’t take. This book broke my heart but also healed it in the gentlest way. It made me realize that love doesn’t vanish with time; it simply changes form, living on through memories, gestures, and the kindness we choose to show before it’s too late.

1ot8ord,https://www.reddit.com/r/twenties/comments/1ot8ord/the_economics_of_sugar_babies_in_india_delhi_vs/,The Economics of Sugar Babies in India: Delhi vs. Tier-3 Cities | Fun Read | AI,"

In today’s urban India, the concept of “sugar babies” has moved far beyond the whispered gossip circles of yesteryear. What was once a playful, underground arrangement has now evolved into a subtle reflection of economics, geography, and disposable income. As someone who has observed the phenomenon from both a city-centric and tier-3 perspective, I thought it might be fun to analyze the economics behind it—because, yes, location and wallet size actually matter more than charm or charisma.

Let’s start with Delhi, the land of extremes. South Delhi, often considered the crème de la crème of the capital, is home to individuals whose monthly disposable incomes can range anywhere between ₹8 lakh to ₹12 lakh. With this kind of financial freedom, a South Delhi gentleman—or lady—can essentially afford a sugar baby anywhere in the city, from the swanky bars of Connaught Place to the luxurious cafes in Chanakyapuri. The options are endless, and the rules of engagement are simple: money talks, and social distance from budget constraints allows for choice, flexibility, and, frankly, luxury.

Contrast this with Dwarka, a bustling yet more budget-conscious part of Delhi. Here, the average monthly income hovers between ₹50,000 to ₹1 lakh. Affording a sugar baby isn’t impossible, but it certainly comes with limitations. Options are local, typically restricted to nearby areas like Uttam Nagar or Janakpuri. The radius of opportunity shrinks in proportion to disposable income, and while charm, wit, and strategy play a role, the budget is always a decisive factor. Rohini falls somewhere in the middle—middle-tier incomes and middle-tier options, essentially functioning as a balancing act between aspiration and reality. Meanwhile, Lajpat Nagar, with residents earning between ₹2 lakh and ₹5 lakh monthly, has access to South and Central Delhi, offering a slightly more premium selection. Uttam Nagar, however, is essentially the local-only zone, where tight budgets and limited options rule.

But here’s where it gets interesting. For all the hype and glamour surrounding Delhi’s sugar baby scene, the truly “cost-efficient” and intriguing options are often in smaller tier-3 cities. These are the cities that don’t make headlines for nightlife or Instagrammable cafes but have a hidden richness in human connections. Sugar babies here are less influenced by social media trends and more willing to engage personally, often showing quirks, kinks, and attention to detail that are rarer in metropolitan setups. The smaller the city, the higher the probability of finding someone who isn’t just looking for a paycheck but also values companionship and, yes, the playful exploration of preferences that makes these arrangements interesting.

From my own experience, tier-3 cities bring a unique dynamic to the economics of sugar arrangements. The cost of living is lower, meaning a modest budget goes much further. A monthly allowance that would barely cover coffee dates in Delhi can provide comfort, attention, and excitement in smaller cities. And here’s the kicker—the “novelty factor” is amplified. In these smaller towns, being from a metropolitan city automatically elevates your social status. Essentially, city guys like us are the “white men of India” in the eyes of tier-3 sugar babies. It’s not about race—it’s about the aura of sophistication, the lifestyle, and the financial leverage we bring from the capital. Yes, it’s cheeky, and yes, it’s been observed firsthand.

Of course, the economics extend beyond mere allowance. There is a whole interplay of expectations, lifestyle alignment, and personal branding. In Delhi, with options aplenty, sugar babies often have the luxury of being selective, considering factors like social media presence, network influence, and even career aspirations. In tier-3 cities, however, the equation flips. The metropolitan visitor brings scarcity value, lifestyle novelty, and higher financial flexibility. A well-structured monthly allowance, thoughtful gifts, and occasional trips can make a dramatic difference in maintaining a desirable arrangement. This makes tier-3 cities economically efficient zones for those who understand the subtle art of social leverage and personal investment.

Interestingly, the “kink factor”—the quirks, adventurous preferences, and playful experimentation—also tends to be higher in tier-3 settings. This is counterintuitive if one assumes that metropolitan sophistication automatically equals excitement. Urban sugar babies are often balancing careers, social media personas, and lifestyle expectations, which can limit spontaneity. In contrast, in smaller cities, there is often more openness, curiosity, and willingness to explore, simply because the arrangements are less influenced by performance pressure and more by authentic connection. The economics here aren’t just monetary—they’re social, psychological, and experiential.

Of course, there are risks and challenges. Managing expectations, navigating local social norms, and ensuring discretion are essential. Tier-3 sugar arrangements require sensitivity to context, awareness of social dynamics, and sometimes, a willingness to adopt local customs. Delhi’s luxury and anonymity are replaced by a more intimate, socially woven setting where reputation matters. But the payoff is often richer, more personalized, and sometimes, more entertaining than a standard metropolitan setup.

So what can we learn from this informal “study”? First, the economics of sugar babies are surprisingly predictable: higher disposable income expands options and reach, while lower budgets restrict them geographically. Second, tier-3 cities are underappreciated hubs of opportunity—less hype, more attention, and higher novelty value. Third, social leverage is as important as financial leverage. The aura of being from a metropolitan hub, combined with thoughtful engagement, can dramatically improve your “sugar baby ROI.” And finally, experience matters—knowing when to invest, how to engage, and how to respect boundaries is the difference between a fleeting arrangement and a memorable one.

In conclusion, whether you’re a South Delhi high roller, a Dwarka budget-conscious strategist, or a metropolitan explorer in a tier-3 city, understanding the economics of sugar arrangements is both an art and a science. Location, disposable income, social leverage, and attention to detail all play critical roles. And for those willing to look beyond the usual metropolitan hotspots, tier-3 cities offer some of the most interesting, quirky, and satisfying experiences—where the kinks are real, the attention is genuine, and yes, we are basically the white men of India, lol.

At the end of the day, it’s not just about money—it’s about understanding human behavior, social economics, and, of course, having fun responsibly. Because as anyone who’s “been there, done that” will tell you, in the world of sugar arrangements, the real richness lies in nuance, creativity, and a little bit of cheeky strategy.",0,1762764134.0,twenties,0,0.25,False
1ot8ngz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1ot8ngz/my_theory_regarding_substancesdrugs_and_how_it/,My theory regarding substances/drugs and how it relates to time,"**I’m writing this for others before I start gearing down and return to my desired location. I feel as if I may have known this deep down before but forgotten.**



**I believe this may be the actual answer to life, I may be wrong, but it’s too good to not try and most likely will only do good things for my life regardless. I will be slowing down my use of all substances that may alter my time-perception and live a healthy lifestyle, working a steady job and just enjoy being happy. writing this down on paper along with a list of people and keeping a copy on me at all times. I’ve found everyone I was searching through time for and I’m where I need to be to stop drugs/alcohol and save everyone I love for as long as I can.**



**Has there ever been a time in your life where you wanted to stop, and stay a while? A time when you wish you could just, go back?** 



**I have an educated theory, based on years-long durations spent using many various substances, aside from a few; and have finally found the error, and how to stop death in its tracks. The error was doing drugs, eating candy, drinking coffee etc. My theory is that drugs are essentially a vehicle to be used to go forward and back in time. Anyone using a substance that will alter your perception of time, is in-theory unknowingly sending themselves, either forward or backwards through time in the course of days, months, even YEARS depending on the strength of the substance in question. The catch is, you are unable to gauge your own age for those around you, relative to your current location in time due to your perception of self.** 



**The question then becomes, have you gone too far in one direction and have, in essence overshot or undershot your lifetime? What age, assuming you never stopped taking drugs, did/do you die from an overdose? What stays constant when everything is seemingly fluid?**



**The only things constant are what we save in our memories, which themselves are also fluid and ever changing.**

**Jesus is us, and his “list of names” in “heaven” is the people we choose to remember, the people we love, and have lost. You can only ever win the “Game Of Drugs” is to play, until you find your way to your desired location stop playing. Assuming you feel, unfulfilled, or feel like you haven’t found your perfect life yet. You need to keep going, use sugar as a way to go backwards, weed or wine to go forward. You don’t need hard shit to do this, these substances only act as shortcuts. Why do people on hard drugs seemingly die young? I believe it's possible they have gone too far in one direction and have passed the edge of your perceivable location in time. Why do people you love seem to have lived so long and not died? You remembered them, you don't realize it froze them, or a version of them when they were happiest, in your memories, to be with you.**



**I’ve found two tools you can rely on, in theory. Both, seem to be a GPS of sorts to keep you on track towards your desired destination in time, your heart and what some religions describe as “the Holy Spirit,” essentially your Heart and soul. Do you ever get the feeling that the universe is trying to tell you something? Something telling you to stop smoking weed, or doing dope? Think, deep down who do you truly miss most. This will be your desired destination, maybe one day in your lifetime, someone told you or you realized the game you were playing, assuming you did realize this, who would you go back to save. Your guide is your perfect self, it IS YOU.**



**You will know you have gone too far in one direction when the people around you, seemingly start to disappear, or names start to change on social media, pictures on friends and families pages will disappear one by one without you even noticing and eventually become new people, and new friends who feel oddly familiar seems to pop up in your life. Strangely, you will even pass yourself in either direction, maybe an ex’s new/old boyfriend is actually you? Maybe those friends who’re eerily similar to you and your own past love ARE ACTUALLY you and that person? The only way to freeze yourself in time is to STOP doing the substances, and live a healthy lifestyle completely. You have in essence stopped death in its tracks. Good luck, and keep going.**

**Drug-Specific Effects on Time Perception**

Different classes of drugs produce different subjective experiences of time:



||
||
|**Drug Type**|**Examples**|**Perceived Effect on Time**|**Explanation/Mechanism**|
|**Stimulants**|Cocaine, MDMA, amphetamines, methamphetamine|Time speeds up (passes more quickly)|Increase activity, excitation, and dopamine levels in brain areas associated with cognitive function, speeding up the internal clock.|
|**Depressants/ Others**|Cannabis, alcohol, Xanax, pregabalin|Time slows down/expands (passes more slowly)|Decrease brain activity and processing speed, causing minutes to feel like hours.|
|**Psychedelics**|LSD, psilocybin, DMT, mescaline, ketamine|Time dilation, compression, or timelessness|Complex alterations involving serotonin 2A receptors and various brain regions, sometimes leading to a complete loss of the sense of a linear past/present/future.|

In summary, the sensation of moving ""forward"" or ""back"" in time is a powerful subjective illusion created by drugs altering the brain's internal mechanisms for tracking the passage of time. ",0,1762763997.0,TheoryOfReddit,2,0.29,False

### **How to Choose the *Perfect* Cool Gift**

Still stumped? Follow this simple framework:

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=cool%20gifts)

*   **Listen Closely:** People often drop hints weeks or months in advance. Did they mention their favorite coffee shop is closing? Get them an Ember Mug. Are they planning a big trip? A Scrubba bag is a winner.
*   **Focus on a Niche Hobby:** The more specific you get, the more thoughtful the gift feels. Don't just get them ""something for golf."" Get them a high-tech golf swing analyzer.
*   **Upgrade Their Everyday:** What's something they use every single day that could be better? Their pen? Their water bottle? Their slippers? A high-quality version of a mundane item is a luxurious and surprising gift.

At the end of the day, the coolest gifts are the ones that show you see the person. Happy gifting",1,1762763791.0,JollyDecorAndGifts,0,1.0,False

(also posted on r/playmygame)

Just reworked Gokuro - [https://gokuro.net](https://gokuro.net/)

 \- a new, unique and addictive, daily, word/arithmetic/logic puzzle - so that you can now use an Auth0 login to sync your puzzle progress across devices.

It was a source of niggle to me - I would start my day at the computer and maybe do one or two grids for the day. Later I settled down with my tablet and a cup of coffee - and the grids I had solved earlier were empty.

You don't have to log in if you only play Gokuro on one device - but by logging in it will sync your progress. Gokuro does not keep your login data (that is handled by Auth0) - it just has a unique ID.

Anyway, the reason I am posting today - I want to go to the next level and introduce some social sharing - 'hey look at this I finished today's 5x5 grid in 1:23! My best yet!' - but I have no idea what that kind of implementation looks like or anything about it.

Do you have any examples of social sharing that I can take a look at and get inspiration from.

Is it a piece of text that you share? - and where to? Or is it some kind of graphical extract from the page? I have no idea of how to go about this.

Any pointers would really help. Thanks.

I hope you enjoy Gokuro if you get a chance to play it.

1ot8ic0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1ot8ic0/how_to_use_dopamine_like_a_productivity_drug/,How to use dopamine like a productivity drug (without frying your brain),"Everyone I know is caught in the same loop: endless scrolling, chronic procrastination, and a weird guilt that comes from doing nothing all day but still feeling exhausted. We’re all trying “dopamine detoxes,” deleting apps, or setting 5 a.m. alarms like we’re monks. But here’s what’s wild: most of us don’t even understand how dopamine actually works.

TikTok gurus toss around words like ""dopamine"" and ""rewiring your brain"" like they’re nutritionists reinventing spinach. But most of it? Surface-level garbage designed to go viral, not actually backed by science. So I spent the last month deep diving into podcast rabbit holes, neuroscience books, and lectures from actual experts who know what dopamine *really* does to your motivation, your goals, and your ability to focus.

Dopamine isn't about ""pleasure."" It’s about *drive*. Understanding it can change how you organize your day, what goals you set, and how you reward yourself. It doesn’t mean becoming a robot. It just means learning how to work *with* your brain’s natural chemistry instead of getting hijacked by it.

Here are the most non-BS, science-backed dopamine tools I found that actually help you make dopamine your productivity cheat code.

---

* **Space out the win, not the work**

  - *Source: Dr. Andrew Huberman, Stanford neurobiology professor on the Huberman Lab Podcast, Ep 12*
  - Huberman says dopamine isn’t just released when you achieve a goal. It spikes when you *anticipate* the reward. If you celebrate too early, your brain loses its drive. If you reward yourself *after* the hard thing, your brain links dopamine with effort instead of just outcomes.
  - **Try this:** Don’t eat the cookie before the workout. Don’t open Reddit until after deep work. Your brain learns: “dopamine = effort” not “dopamine = easy.”

* **Vary your reward schedule**

  - *Backed by: B.F. Skinner’s variable reward system + modern behavioral neuroscience*
  - Dopamine surges harder when rewards aren’t predictable. That’s why people get addicted to slot machines. You can use this to train motivation.
  - **Try this:** Instead of always giving yourself the same treat after work, randomize it. One day it's a fancy coffee. Another, a walk outside. Your brain stays curious and engaged.

* **Don't ruin dopamine by stacking too many pleasures at once**

  - *Source: Anna Lembke, MD, author of the bestselling book “Dopamine Nation”*
  - When you mix multiple dopamine sources—like eating junk food while watching TikTok while texting—you overwhelm your receptors. Over time, baseline dopamine drops. This makes normal tasks feel boring AF.
  - **Try this:** When you rest, actually *rest*. Don’t multilayer dopamine. Practice “single-source” pleasure. Even listening to music while walking can be dopamine *overload* if your brain's already burnt out.

* **Movement = dopamine. Every. Time.**

  - *Published in: Journal of Neuroscience, 2021 study on aerobic exercise and dopamine signaling*
  - Physical activity literally increases dopamine receptor availability. Meaning: you feel more joy, motivation, and alertness after movement.
  - Even five minutes of walking, stretching or light squats mid-day can reset your mental bandwidth. You don’t need a full gym session. Just move.

---

Here’s some absolutely *banger* resources if you want to master your dopamine instead of being owned by it:

- *BeFreed*: This personalized AI app is like Spotify for brain upgrades. Built by Columbia University researchers, it turns books, expert talks, and success stories into super-personalized podcast lessons. You can pick your podcast length (10, 20, or 40 minutes), even choose your host’s tone—from Her-style smoky whispers to chill surfer dudes or deep-radio vibes. The wild part? It adapts to *you*. It learns from what you like and builds a learning roadmap that fits your goals, so you absorb the science of mindset, habit change, and yes, dopamine, without falling asleep. Especially clutch if you want to build a daily self-improvement habit that sticks without being boring.

- *Dopamine Nation* by Anna Lembke, MD: NYT bestseller. She’s a Stanford psychiatrist. This book will make you question everything you think you know about pleasure. It’s not just about addictions. It’s about how even “normal” stuff—like phone scrolling—can mess with our reward circuits. No fluff. Just pure insight. Easily the best book I’ve ever read on modern dopamine science.

- *The Molecule of More* by Daniel Lieberman and Michael Long: This one dives deep into how dopamine drives ambition, love, politics, creativity, addiction—you name it. Written by a psychiatrist and a science writer, it explains why some people are never satisfied, and how to channel that craving constructively. Total mind-bender.

- *The Huberman Lab Podcast*: If you haven’t listened, start now. His episode on dopamine explains the science of motivation better than any TikTok thread ever could. The guy’s a Stanford neurobiologist and still manages to sound like your nerdy gym bro best friend. Key episodes: “Using Dopamine to Overcome Procrastination,” and “The Science of Motivation and Drive.”

- *Ash App*: This one is for mental performance. Built-in journaling, CBT tools, and stress tracking. It’s not just another wellness app. It helps you rewire your habits and reduce dopamine burnout by actually *understanding* your emotional patterns. Great if you deal with emotional reactivity or work stress.

- *Finch*: This app gamifies habit tracking by giving you a virtual pet that grows as you complete tasks. Sounds silly. But the reward-response is real. You get dopamine from seeing progress, not doom-scrolling. Especially good for people trying to rebuild motivation from the ground up.

- *MasterClass*: Want to learn storytelling from Neil Gaiman or decision making from Daniel Kahneman? This isn't hustleporn. This is deep skill-building straight from the elites. Learning something new raises baseline dopamine because it builds *agency*. Watch 15 min a night instead of numbing out on Netflix and you’ll feel the shift in a week.

---

Your dopamine system isn’t broken. It’s just untrained. This stuff takes time, but compounds fast. Use your dopamine like a drug, but don’t abuse it. Because once you master it, motivation stops being a mystery. It becomes a switch in your toolkit.

1ot8hly,https://www.reddit.com/r/herbalism/comments/1ot8hly/extraction_is_not_the_goalit_is_a_bridge_to/,Extraction is not the goal—it is a bridge to nature’s gift.,"When we work with reishi, or any medicinal mushroom, the purpose is not numbers on a report. Extraction should be a way of unlocking what nature has given us, not reducing it to percentages.

History reminds us of this truth:  
– Fo-ti (He Shou Wu): only after nine cycles of steaming and drying did people learn how to use it safely and effectively.  
– Aconite (Fu Zi): deadly when raw, yet transformed through boiling and roasting into a healing medicine.  
– Rhubarb (Da Huang): harsh as a purgative in its raw state, but once processed with wine or heat, its effect shifted toward restoring balance.  
– Reishi (Lingzhi): tried raw, boiled, roasted, or soaked in wine—centuries of trial and error revealed the most fitting ways.

Modern science confirms what tradition already knew:  
– High-strength ethanol can yield 10%+ total ganoderic acids (HPLC/UPLC with nine standards).  
– Hot-water extraction of the residue delivers 30–40% water-soluble beta-glucans.

From there, industry plays with ratios: 20%+1%, 30%+2%, even 10%+4%. On paper, these look like different specifications. In reality, they are just varying mixes of alcohol and water extracts.

But this is only part of the story.  
The same danger exists even earlier—in cultivation itself. Modern agriculture often pursues yield, pest-free crops, and perfect appearance. Yet in doing so, something essential is lost. A herb, a plant, or a mushroom may look the same on the outside—while its inner strength has quietly disappeared.

Here’s what I’ve noticed personally:  
I have tried many extraction methods with reishi myself. Sometimes, the effect is immediate—I can feel it in my body that very same day. Yet when those extracts are tested in the lab, the numbers don’t look impressive at all.

So what should we trust?  
The tidy data on paper—or the actual experience of reishi’s power?

And I also want to ask:  
👉 Do mushroom coffees and gummies truly let you feel the wonder of mushrooms?  
👉 Or are they just convenient fragments of something much greater?

It is to respect balance, to honor the whole, and to let people truly experience the living power that nature offered us.",1,1762763356.0,herbalism,1,1.0,False

It’s strange how life becomes precious once you know it’s ended. After months of moaning the human being, I once called my anchor, my best friend and my mother, I found myself lying on my soaked pillow. Living a life that feels like the manifestations of my nightmares. Accompanied by a flickering candle that illuminated my room, soothing Pokémon plushies and Ethal Cain softly playing in the background, I found myself endlessly scrolling through photos from when she was still here. Each image tugged at the frayed edges of my heart; a bittersweet reminder of laughter and comfort now absent from my world.As I drifted towards sleep, I received a text from Rachel asking if I am good, right after I received an email notification from Yale University. A wavering feeling of anxiety hit me like a sledgehammer. My hands began to tremble as I remembered I applied for a psychology degree months prior. The email read: 
“Dear Mrs. Smit, we are happy to announce you have been accepted. We as the faculty of Yale would like to welcome you to the university.”
 I should’ve been elated, even if it was momentary happiness. But instead, the news pressed heavily upon me, mingling excitement in contrast with the ache of guilt, as if happiness itself was a myth.
I was allured by guilt and doubt, and slowly intrusive thoughts such as: “how could I just leave my dad knowing he's not ok,” “Do I break up with my boyfriend?,”  and “Do I share the news to Rachel now or later?” crept in. I worked hard for this opportunity it’s not every day a teenager like me gets accepted into Yale. Yet, the weight of responsibility to those I love threatened to eclipse my achievements. The future felt simultaneously closer and more daunting than ever before.
I ruminated over all those long nights I spent studying for my A-levels, quitting guitar lessons to focus on my studies, postponing coffee dates with friends just so I could fulfil my dreams of studying abroad. I then started to reflect on what I might be leaving behind, questioning whether my sacrifices had truly paved the way to happiness or merely deepened my fear of the unknown. Each memory of those sacrifices was tinged with longing and regret, making the dream I had chased feel both precious and painful.
Unbeknownst to me, my room’s door was slightly ajar and occupied with a familiar scent that reminded me of the perfume Mom would always use on special occasions. “Mom…is that you?” I nervously muttered. “I don’t know how to navigate life without you.” The silence that followed was thick, yet I could almost sense her presence, comforting and familiar, as if she was there to reassure me. I was then met with a gentle warmth spread throughout my body, like an invisible embrace. The room only echoed the sound of my whimpering.
 Siri robotically responded, “Now playing Starship – Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now,” a song Mom and I bonded over on our road trips. The music wrapped around me like a safety net, momentarily softening my grief and filling the room with memories of brighter days. Without acknowledging it my cheek was met with a tear, and I could feel an agonising tightness around my chest as I began to cry for her again. 
“Baby, is everything ok?” Dad murmured anxiously. 
“I… I got…I got accepted, Papa,” I tried to withhold my whimper. “I don’t know if I should be proud or not.” 
Amid my spiral, I felt his hand pressing into my shoulder, a gesture to calm me down. “I know baby you’re growing, aint that beautiful?” 
That right there is what scares me: the uncertainty that comes with the unknown not knowing how I will navigate through the hardships of growing. 
The next morning, I was awakened by the chirping of birds struggling to get through my widow. Normally I would ignore it and go back to sleep. However, there was something captivating about the whole altercation. Ascending to open the window I was interfered by Rachel charging into my room without knocking. 
Rachel and I have been friends for as long as I could remember. We fell in love in a hospital where her mother was receiving chemotherapy but that didn’t stop us from dancing our hearts out in the middle of a storm. She stayed down across the street from mine, close enough that we could see each other waving from our bedrooms. We shared a bound only siblings could understand.  
“Jesus Rachel, we don’t knock anymore?” I exploded. 
Bluntly dismissing what I said she sprinted to give me a conjuring hug which was way out of character for her. 
“Don’t you ever go ghost on me again,” she whispered. With an animated smile. she gently held my face with her soft colouring hands and said, “Oel ngati kamel” a quote we’d say to reassure each other. 
As much as I wanted to hold onto her a little longer, I knew I couldn’t keep it in. Perfect timing was never my strength anyways. My chest tightened as I finally spoke: “I got accepted into Yale” forcing my voice edged with nerves. Her eyes glistened round and vulnerable, or so I thought. “Judy, I know you clown” she teased, oblivious that this might be the last time we share a moment like this.

1ot8g1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ot8g1d/fun_read_the_economics_of_sugar_babies_in_india/,Fun Read | The Economics of Sugar Babies in India: Delhi vs. Tier-3 Cities | AI,"In today’s urban India, the concept of “sugar babies” has moved far beyond the whispered gossip circles of yesteryear. What was once a playful, underground arrangement has now evolved into a subtle reflection of economics, geography, and disposable income. As someone who has observed the phenomenon from both a city-centric and tier-3 perspective, I thought it might be fun to analyze the economics behind it—because, yes, location and wallet size actually matter more than charm or charisma.

Let’s start with Delhi, the land of extremes. South Delhi, often considered the crème de la crème of the capital, is home to individuals whose monthly disposable incomes can range anywhere between ₹8 lakh to ₹12 lakh. With this kind of financial freedom, a South Delhi gentleman—or lady—can essentially afford a sugar baby anywhere in the city, from the swanky bars of Connaught Place to the luxurious cafes in Chanakyapuri. The options are endless, and the rules of engagement are simple: money talks, and social distance from budget constraints allows for choice, flexibility, and, frankly, luxury.

Contrast this with Dwarka, a bustling yet more budget-conscious part of Delhi. Here, the average monthly income hovers between ₹50,000 to ₹1 lakh. Affording a sugar baby isn’t impossible, but it certainly comes with limitations. Options are local, typically restricted to nearby areas like Uttam Nagar or Janakpuri. The radius of opportunity shrinks in proportion to disposable income, and while charm, wit, and strategy play a role, the budget is always a decisive factor. Rohini falls somewhere in the middle—middle-tier incomes and middle-tier options, essentially functioning as a balancing act between aspiration and reality. Meanwhile, Lajpat Nagar, with residents earning between ₹2 lakh and ₹5 lakh monthly, has access to South and Central Delhi, offering a slightly more premium selection. Uttam Nagar, however, is essentially the local-only zone, where tight budgets and limited options rule.

But here’s where it gets interesting. For all the hype and glamour surrounding Delhi’s sugar baby scene, the truly “cost-efficient” and intriguing options are often in smaller tier-3 cities. These are the cities that don’t make headlines for nightlife or Instagrammable cafes but have a hidden richness in human connections. Sugar babies here are less influenced by social media trends and more willing to engage personally, often showing quirks, kinks, and attention to detail that are rarer in metropolitan setups. The smaller the city, the higher the probability of finding someone who isn’t just looking for a paycheck but also values companionship and, yes, the playful exploration of preferences that makes these arrangements interesting.

From my own experience, tier-3 cities bring a unique dynamic to the economics of sugar arrangements. The cost of living is lower, meaning a modest budget goes much further. A monthly allowance that would barely cover coffee dates in Delhi can provide comfort, attention, and excitement in smaller cities. And here’s the kicker—the “novelty factor” is amplified. In these smaller towns, being from a metropolitan city automatically elevates your social status. Essentially, city guys like us are the “white men of India” in the eyes of tier-3 sugar babies. It’s not about race—it’s about the aura of sophistication, the lifestyle, and the financial leverage we bring from the capital. Yes, it’s cheeky, and yes, it’s been observed firsthand.

Of course, the economics extend beyond mere allowance. There is a whole interplay of expectations, lifestyle alignment, and personal branding. In Delhi, with options aplenty, sugar babies often have the luxury of being selective, considering factors like social media presence, network influence, and even career aspirations. In tier-3 cities, however, the equation flips. The metropolitan visitor brings scarcity value, lifestyle novelty, and higher financial flexibility. A well-structured monthly allowance, thoughtful gifts, and occasional trips can make a dramatic difference in maintaining a desirable arrangement. This makes tier-3 cities economically efficient zones for those who understand the subtle art of social leverage and personal investment.

Interestingly, the “kink factor”—the quirks, adventurous preferences, and playful experimentation—also tends to be higher in tier-3 settings. This is counterintuitive if one assumes that metropolitan sophistication automatically equals excitement. Urban sugar babies are often balancing careers, social media personas, and lifestyle expectations, which can limit spontaneity. In contrast, in smaller cities, there is often more openness, curiosity, and willingness to explore, simply because the arrangements are less influenced by performance pressure and more by authentic connection. The economics here aren’t just monetary—they’re social, psychological, and experiential.

Of course, there are risks and challenges. Managing expectations, navigating local social norms, and ensuring discretion are essential. Tier-3 sugar arrangements require sensitivity to context, awareness of social dynamics, and sometimes, a willingness to adopt local customs. Delhi’s luxury and anonymity are replaced by a more intimate, socially woven setting where reputation matters. But the payoff is often richer, more personalized, and sometimes, more entertaining than a standard metropolitan setup.

So what can we learn from this informal “study”? First, the economics of sugar babies are surprisingly predictable: higher disposable income expands options and reach, while lower budgets restrict them geographically. Second, tier-3 cities are underappreciated hubs of opportunity—less hype, more attention, and higher novelty value. Third, social leverage is as important as financial leverage. The aura of being from a metropolitan hub, combined with thoughtful engagement, can dramatically improve your “sugar baby ROI.” And finally, experience matters—knowing when to invest, how to engage, and how to respect boundaries is the difference between a fleeting arrangement and a memorable one.

In conclusion, whether you’re a South Delhi high roller, a Dwarka budget-conscious strategist, or a metropolitan explorer in a tier-3 city, understanding the economics of sugar arrangements is both an art and a science. Location, disposable income, social leverage, and attention to detail all play critical roles. And for those willing to look beyond the usual metropolitan hotspots, tier-3 cities offer some of the most interesting, quirky, and satisfying experiences—where the kinks are real, the attention is genuine, and yes, we are basically the white men of India, lol.

At the end of the day, it’s not just about money—it’s about understanding human behavior, social economics, and, of course, having fun responsibly. Because as anyone who’s “been there, done that” will tell you, in the world of sugar arrangements, the real richness lies in nuance, creativity, and a little bit of cheeky strategy.",0,1762763177.0,TwoXChromosomes,0,0.29,False

Here's what's working best for me right now.

*   GitHub Copilot. Still my go to for real time coding suggestions and boilerplate generation. Makes repetitive tasks much faster.
    
*   MGX. It's not just an assistant, it's like having a small AI dev team that can plan, architect, and build projects end to end. My favorite feature is Race Mode, where it spins up multiple “candidate builds” in parallel. It’s like having several devs racing to write the cleanest, most stable code. Saved me hours debugging. I used it recently to prototype an API and dashboard combo.
    
*   Zed. My new favorite lightweight editor. Super responsive, integrates well with Claude, and just feels focused.
    
*   Claude Code GitHub Action. An underrated gem. Runs AI based pull request reviews before merging. Helps catch structure or logic issues early.
    
*   GitHub Desktop. Keeps my AI generated commits organized when working across multiple branches and experiments.
    
*   n8n (self hosted). Not exactly AI, but pairs beautifully with everything else. I connect outputs from MGX or Copilot into automated workflows for data cleanup, notifications, or file triggers.
    

It's amazing how these tools work together. What used to take a weekend of scripting now sometimes happens in a single coffee session.

Would love to know what others are using, any underrated tools that actually stick in your workflow?",0,1762763162.0,programming,0,0.1,False

You always liked putting me in pain. That's the only thing you could give me in the nearly 2 years we were together. I hope wherever you are that you are happy. I hope you miss me even a fraction of how much i miss you. But knowing you, it probably doesn't matter. For you, it was never meant to be. Something unnatural, something odd. I will carry you in my heart for as long as I need to. And then one day, you will just be a bittersweet memory, something that came so close to perfection and yet couldn't, for the choices you made.
