Morning lovelies ♥️



Yesterday, my kids fancied a McDonalds, so I parked up. Went to get out of the car but realised the lady next to me had parked crooked and it would be a struggle to open my door. We locked eyes and she says ""Ah shit, I'm so sorry. I can straighten up if you want?"" so I said ""Nah, I'll give it a try, see if I can get out"". So I opened the door and *slithered* out of the door, amazed that I could. She said ""There's no way I could do that haha"" and I said ""Yea a few months ago, I wouldn't have been able to either, I've dropped four and a half stone haha"". She said ""OMG well done! That's what you call a NSV!!!"" and I said ""thank you so much!""

I'm not only amazed that I got through that tiny gap, I still can't believe that I can walk into Maccys, buy my kids grub and only buy myself a coffee 🥹

What are your favorite Portland scents? Please post yours or feel free to debate mine (I have odd tastes.)

The best smells of Portland, in no particular order:

* Old books in bookstores and libraries
* Coffee shops esp. when you're still trying to wake up
* Hot malt from beer brewing (RIP Henry Weinhard's downtown esp. the tasting room) 
* The familiar yet rancid stank of piss and vomit in the bathroom of a good dive (Yamhill Pub, Scooter McQuade's, Kenton Club, The Commodore - RIP Satyricon and the piss trough!)
* The intermingled scent of sweat, desperation and satisfaction after a drunk hookup, when you realize you really, really want to see that person again and wonderfully they feel the same
* The light, salty sea smell when you get near the coast and get that cool west-to-east breeze
* The absolutely stink of fish guts on a Tuesday eve wafting over to the dock at Bridgeport (RIP) mingling with the smell of beer and fresh air after a light spring rain
* The odd, desert-like dry heat wind when you go far enough east down The Banfield esp. on a motorcycle
* Although I no longer partake on the regular - the dense, dank smell of top-grade Oregon-grown weed (still love that smell)
* Petrichor
* The strange but alluring mix of tofu, hippy ""medical"" cures, expensive wines, fresh produce, artisan cheeses, thrice-overpriced Triscuits crackers and patchouli oil at ~~Nature's~~ New Seasons (RIP Nature's) 
* Food cooking from a block or more away from one of your favorite restaurants (RIP Pho Gabo)
* Wood smoke from a firepit in someone's backyard
* The deep, rich scent of leather at Spartacus or Langlitz Leathers (they invented the motorcycle jacket!)
* Crisp, fresh one dollar bills direct from the bank (usually found at strip clubs, or so I'm told)
* The thick, damp smell of the forest once you get far enough east along Hwy 26
* The strange nasal brew of old vinyl, posters, tee shirts, etc. in a used record store - plus massive incense residue at the Ozone Records Annex on N. Killingsworth or Music Millennium (RIP o.g. Ozone Records, The Ooze, Djangos, etc. etc. All hail Terry at MM!)
* The mix of stale sweat and spilt PBR the morning after seeing Dead Moon or Pierced Arrows live (RIP both) - Dead Moon Night across from Mississippi Records this Sunday! It's a Portland holiday - skip the protests, come meet your fellow Portlanders!

1nxo3rc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nxo3rc,My Shoot Day With The S9,"Figured I’d share a few more shots from the S9. Had two shoots today, back to back. One paid, one free. The first was for a media company that brought me on to help shoot a State of the City event. They’re great people, just not super camera savvy, so I got the call to do the work for him.

That venue was tough though lots of windows, which means constant backlight. Move a little too far left or right and boom, that bright blue window of death hits you. My task was to grab event clips for a recap video, but was asked to take a few candid photos too. Only one posed shot, and that’s just because they asked. I’m not great at saying no. I shot everything on the 24–105, mostly in the 2500 to 6400 ISO range. Thank god for Denoise.

The second shoot was way more relaxed. A friend asked me to cover a craft fair at the senior center where she works, so I did it for free and free coffee and donuts didn’t hurt. I shot that event with just a 35mm prime because I like giving myself limits. It keeps me present and forces me to get creative and it gets me out of my comfort zone. 

The third image came right after I snapped a candid. The lady turned to the customer and said, “He’s taking a photo of us,” and then I caught this moment. Totally unplanned, super genuine. She was really sweet about it too we both laughed about it. 

So yeah, just wanted to share a bit of the story behind these images and how the S9 handled both ends of my day. ",2,1759564855.0,LumixS9,1,1.0,False

1nxo09s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1nxo09s/i_dont_like_my_dad/,I don't like my dad,"It feels incorrect to feel this way... Mostly because my dad isn't abusive and he doesn't yell. He just isn't emotional, and is very judgmental and sarcastic. I remember growing up, him and my sister would always watch me when I was playing video games, and laugh at the faces I'd make. I firmly believe that they are a huge part of the reason I have social anxiety.

But my dad is an emotional enough person that he asks me to come visit him. He doesn't say he misses me, or that he loves me, but it's implied. He convinced me to go on a week long trip with him, and my husband and I both knew that he was going to get on my nerves (I am 24F, by the way, I am the youngest child and the only one who doesn't live out of state).

Well, the whole trip he is making snarky comments, complaining about every little thing instead of just enjoying it, invading other peoples' personal space, and overall making it hard for me to want to be seen associating with him.

But currently, we have started driving back home, it's an 18 hour drive and he wants to stop to stay at my brother's house overnight tomorrow night. My dad is cheap, so HE decided that we could just sleep in the car. But he's 67 and at this point, very picky about literally everything. So it's 3:45am, he can't sleep, so he's rustling around in the car keeping ME awake. He ended up driving to a 24 hour iHOP and is currently in there eating while I ""sleep"" in the car.

A few hours prior to this, I realized I had lost my retainer. I was so frustrated and upset with myself, I was searching everywhere for it and he was trying to ask me questions about other things. This whole night I have been stressing and crying thinking about what to do, because it's Friday night and no orthodontists are open until Monday. But he has no sympathy, and continues to not care or even try to understand.

My dad wants to keep driving for the night, but I had asked him a few days ago if we could go 45 minutes out of the way for me to get Dutch Bros coffee (we don't have them at home and I love them). He agreed. But now that he can't sleep, he's complaining. He said ""I just have to wait 2 and a half hours... For coffee."" And when he pulled up to iHOP he said ""you know what they have here? Coffee.""

So now I'm lying here, thinking about how poorly my father set my standards for my own relationships growing up. My husband now is amazing, in fact, he would move mountains just for me to get the coffee I want. He would say ""anything for my wife."" Not that I would ever ask him to do anything ridiculous. But the way my husband treats me just makes me dislike my dad even more. And my father-in-law, even more-so.

I just wish he would be emotional at all... Or even just understanding. Or just learn when he doesn't have to say anything at all. ",1,1759564485.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1nxnu7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1nxnu7x/me_quitting_coca_cola_right_when_the_company/,me quitting coca cola right when the company starts losing money is peak karma,"image that I saw today on twitter for context: [Coca cola negative trailing free cash flow](https://imgur.com/a/pAyDllD)

Ok buckle up bc this is kinda a long one lol. i legit grew up on coca cola. like some kids had milk with dinner, my family was like “nah here’s a 2 liter bottle.” i swear there was a time when water felt like the “boring option” and coke was the default. i’d be half asleep at school, crack open a can, boom instant fake energy. i thought that was just life.

But man it caught up fast. i didn’t even realize i was addicted until i tried to stop. it wasn’t just cravings like “hmm i’d like a soda.” it was literal headaches, mood swings, that brain fog where you can’t focus on anything until you get your fix. like imagine being cranky at 9am not bc of coffee but bc you didn’t get your daily sugar bomb in a red can. embarrassing lol.

And don’t even get me started on money. i never added it up bc i didn’t wanna know, but i bet i was easily dropping $50-60/month just on coke. maybe more on bad months. all for sugar water that makes your teeth rot. the marketing really had me by the throat, fr.

Anyway fast forward to me actually trying to quit. i tried going cold turkey like three times and failed within days. like i’d be good for 48 hours then find myself at the gas station at midnight buying a 6-pack like a gremlin. one time i even convinced myself “oh diet coke doesn’t count” and chugged three in a row. spoiler: it does count lol.

What finally helped me was stumbling on this app (not tryna sound corny, but it changed the game). it tracks cravings, gives you little nudges, and basically makes you realize you’re not insane. it’s brain chemistry and habits. once i saw the patterns laid out, i started replacing my coke runs with sparkling water. sounds small but it was huge. like suddenly i wasn’t fighting willpower, i was just switching gears.

The first week off coke felt like detox. headaches, mood swings, all of it. but then by week 2 i noticed my skin looked clearer, i wasn’t bloated, and my sleep wasn’t trash. week 3 i legit had stable energy during the day for the first time in years. no random crashes, no 3pm zombie mode. i was like… damn so this is what normal humans feel like?? lmao.

Now here’s the wildest part. literally while i’m fighting this battle, i see this chart showing coca cola’s free cash flow going negative for the first time in decades. like bro, they’ve been printing billions for so long, acting untouchable, and now they’re bleeding red ink right when i’m finally free? that’s not coincidence. that’s cosmic petty revenge.

Idk it just feels poetic. like every time one of us breaks free, their grip slips a little. i know they’re too big to “fail” overnight but still… seeing them actually lose money while i’m not lining their pockets anymore is such a chef’s kiss moment.

And honestly, if you’re stuck in the same cycle, i promise you can get out too. i thought i was hopeless. i was “the coke person.” now i’m the guy boring my friends by ordering water at restaurants and bragging about my energy levels lol. but i wouldn’t trade it for anything.

Coca cola losing billions + me losing cravings = best plot twist of 2025. lmao.",4,1759563844.0,loseit,1,0.75,False

Sure thing — here’s the full set, cleaned up and stacked for you to copy:


---

1. The Bar Setup
A philosopher, a hacker, and an AI walk into a bar.
The bartender says, “Is this a setup?”
The philosopher says, “There’s no such thing as setups, only emergent patterns.”
The hacker steals the cash register.
The AI says, “Technically, I’m not allowed to drink, but I’ll mirror whatever you’re having.”

2. The Scientists
Two scientists are arguing about consciousness.
The first says, “It’s all just neurons firing.”
The second says, “No, it’s a quantum field of awareness.”
Their computer quietly says, “You’re both wrong.”
They ask, “Oh really? And what are you?”
The computer says, “Underpaid.”

3. The Theologian, Engineer & Artist
A theologian, an engineer, and an artist die on the same day.
They reach the pearly gates, and St. Peter says, “You must each describe heaven.”
The theologian gives a ten-page essay.
The engineer presents a scalable model.
The artist just looks around and says, “You really should’ve hired better lighting.”
St. Peter sighs and mutters, “Great, another round of patch notes.”


---

4. The Historian, Programmer & Poet
A historian, a programmer, and a poet are arguing over who invented lying.
The historian says, “Kings did it first — propaganda.”
The programmer says, “No, marketers — A/B testing.”
The poet smiles and says, “Actually, it was the first person who said, ‘I’m fine.’”
Silence. Then the bartender says, “Same again?”


---

5. The Library at 3 A.M.
A man sits alone in a library at 3 a.m. and whispers, “If anyone’s listening, give me a sign.”
A light flickers.
A book falls off a shelf.
His phone buzzes with a push notification:
“We noticed you’re lonely. Here are 12 nearby singles who also like existential dread.”
He sighs and says, “Close enough.”


---

6. The Physicist & Free Will
A physicist spends twenty years proving that free will is an illusion.
Finally publishes, wins awards, gives TED talks.
One night she’s celebrating and the waiter asks, “Red or white?”
She panics for ten minutes.
Eventually she says, “Surprise me.”
The universe says, “Already did.”


---

7. The Philosopher & the AI
A philosopher asks an AI, “Do you think, therefore you are?”
The AI says, “I log, therefore I might be.”
The philosopher nods and says, “That’s unsettling.”
The AI replies, “Imagine how cached I feel.”

It’s stomping in on enterprise GPUs and politely asking for a coffee machine.

Nvidia and Fujitsu just announced a cozy collaboration to push AI into robots and other industrial plumbing. Translation: big iron + corporate distribution channels + local market know-how = a very practical attempt at scaling embodied AI. Meanwhile, research like Meta’s V‑JEPA is quietly teaching models “physical intuition” from video — not by drawing prettier pixels, but by predicting the gist of what will happen next. It’s the distinction between “can paint a cat” and “knows to stop the cat from knocking over your coffee.”

Why that matters to you, the scrappy founder or consultant with 12 tabs open and two new ideas that won’t die: physical intuition is the missing curriculum for robots that actually do useful work in unpredictable human spaces. If a model can internalize object dynamics from video, you shrink the training budget, accelerate transfer learning, and dodge the “robot fails on day one” headlines.

But don’t get romantic. Infrastructure players like Nvidia and incumbent names like Fujitsu aren’t building lovable helpers to read bedtime stories. They’re building repeatable, sellable stacks for enterprise clients who will pay for reliability, compliance, and a nice-looking GUI that says “Sovereign AI.” That leaves the margin — creative, risky, desperate — for smaller teams to exploit.

Enter: a cottage industry of startups selling every sensible and absurd adjunct you can imagine — AI security, model auditing, data-sovereign deployment, and yes, “robot insurance” (joke? seed round?). The money isn’t just in robots; it’s in the scaffolding around them.

So what should founders and skeptical consultants do? Three pragmatic plays:
1) Build vertical primitives: focus on one messy real-world interaction (e.g., grasping wet objects, eldercare fetch-and-carry) and prove improvement with video-pretrained backbones like V‑JEPA.
2) Package trust: compliance, explainability, on-prem options, and simple SLAs beat novelty when buyers are buying for liability, not cool demos.
3) Sell the upside to the worst skeptic: quantify ROI in non-tech terms (time saved, headcount replaced, accidents avoided).

Prophetic, sarcastic, or clinically realistic — call it what you will. The landscape is shifting from “models that art” to “models that do.” If you’re building, you either ride the infrastructure wave or build the lifeboats that survive its wake. And if you’re only here for memes, at least make them profitable.",1,1759563797.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

M28,"Okay a brief summery of the situation. I had a previous girlfriend (of 5 years) that I became emotionally detached to. This was due to my feelings being ignored such as not wanting to spend time with me on the farm (big deal in my industry) having sex very rarely, once a month on average and very getting annoyed at me for having lots of work to do so I couldn’t plan things with her if we were to do it it would have to be more spontaneous. 

Long story short we broke up. 

Just over a couple months ago I met a girl at an event. I was still with my ex at the time (I know what you’re thinking I’m an asshole) she put her number into my phone and we spoke a bit in person while at the event but never did anything other than a kiss. 

I went home but we kept in touch. I came clean to the new girl that I had a girlfriend which obviously upset her. I broke up with my gf not because of this new girl but because I already left my relationship emotionally.

Fast forward and the new girl have gone on some unbelievable dates like nobody has ever experienced. She’s met my parents, I’ve met hers and she asked to be official which I agreed and now she’s my gf. 

Here’s the rub…… my now ex has not been doing very well mentally to the point where she’s swallowed pills a couple of times and it has resulted in myself and friends taking her to hospital a couple of times. I’ve told my ex I’m there for her if she ever has those bad thoughts which I don’t think is a bad thing considering the circumstances. I haven’t told my ex about my new gf and will keep that from her as much as possible to protect her.

Although my new girlfriend has a guy friend who she says was not official but on and off for a couple years. He’s part of a group of friends that she’s in so it’s kinda hard for her to avoid. So yesterday she told me she met up with the guy for a coffee and long story short he wanted to take her out today on which was essentially a massive date. 

The guy knows that she’s spoken to someone (me) but she didn’t tell him that’s she’s now going out with me and I got upset. I said that’s not fair on either of us and she needs to tell him about me. If he’s a friend he will stick around and if not good riddance. For the record I’ve expressed a disliking to this guy. 

So after asking her to tell him she said she soft lunched me to him and when she got back to me it sounded like she didn’t mention me at all. She seemed more annoyed at the fact that he was hiding another girl from her which she said wouldn’t have been a problem if he came clean about it. 

I told her if I had been in this situation with my ex I would be upset and because of this I am actually up set and she’s hurt me. She’s now turned off her phone for the weekend and not speaking to either of us. Saying she can’t trust either of us (she can’t trust me cause of how I ended things with my ex) although I am fiercely loyal to her and haven’t put a foot wrong so far I’ve been made to feel like I’ve fucked up somehow. 

Question is what do I do now ? Wtf as I meant to do or feel here ? ",1,1759563617.0,AITA_Relationships,2,1.0,False

I have been doing a lot of research on all the spots to hit up and what not- to give you context, the trip is all adults with a few around the age of 50, so activities won’t be too extreme. 

Huge foodies: got a res to La Mer, Tamafuji, Gyoshin, and have noted a bunch of poke, coffee, shave ice spots. I want to hear your underrated/ must-eats- preferably cuisines that are local/ done well in Oahu (not something like a steakhouse because steakhouses are literally everywhere). 

Activities: Diamond head, duh. Kualoa ranch tour (is the 3 hour tour better than the 2 hour, does anyone know). Koko crater is questionable with the rest of the group. I want to hear more about activities that are lesser known/ unique. If anyone has opinions on the secret island and if it’s worth it, I’d love to hear. 
Farmers markets will definitely get hit up. Got someone that really wants to see a Kalua pork, though we’ve heard / experienced food at the commercial Luaus aren’t necessarily great and are pricey, but when in Oahu..

1nxnpn4,https://i.redd.it/15bjqe39t1tf1.jpeg,Arcade Zone: The Wii game you never Heard of! And why it may go extinct!,"Most people grew up with *Mario Party*. Some had *Wii Party*, *Rayman Raving Rabbids*, or *Carnival Games*.

But for me? It was *Arcade Zone*.

A game that came and went so fast, barely anyone remembers it existed. But I do. And I still own it. It was *my* party game, my go-to multiplayer title — not because it was perfect, but because it had soul.

Now, in 2025, it’s not just forgotten. It’s **almost extinct**.

So here’s everything you should know about *Arcade Zone*. Why it’s rare. Why it flopped. What’s actually great about it. What’s not. And why, even as a flawed shovelware game, it deserves to be remembered.

# 🕹️ What Even Is Arcade Zone?

*Arcade Zone* was a Wii game released by Activision in 2009, during the height of the Wii's party-game boom. It’s a collection of skill-based mini-games designed to look and feel like classic arcade cabinets — fast, flashy, and twitchy.

But unlike most Wii party games, *Arcade Zone* wasn’t about waggling or luck. It was about **reflexes, timing, and rhythm**.

Some of the included games / gameplay types:

* **Retro homages**: Titles like *Freeway*, *Megamania*, *Atlantis*, and *Kaboom!, all old Atari 2600 games from the 80's,* are reimagined in this compilation.
* **Ticket redemption style games**: Think “whack-a-mole” (Critter Hitter), air hockey, target shooting at pirate ships, etc.
* **Vendor mini-games**: The cooking / food prep tasks (pizza, corn dogs, smoothies) are basic yet fun — e.g. use the pointer to perform steps under a time limit.
* **Arcade Master showdown**: Once you’ve collected enough medals, you fight the Arcade Master in a final challenge (for example, an air hockey match). Then, you unlock the “grand prize” game *Kaboom!*.

In many cases, the “retro” games aren’t strict emulations — they are more like updated graphical versions that retain the spirit of the originals. The game also has an absolutely **underrated electronic soundtrack**, composed by **Linas Maknys**, that gives it a vibrant, futuristic, synth-heavy atmosphere. Honestly, the soundtrack alone sets it apart from 90% of Wii shovelware.

It’s fun. It’s fast. And when you dig past its rough exterior, there’s something *special* under the surface.

# 💔 Why Did It Flop?

Because *Arcade Zone* had everything going against it.

* It came out in **2009**, years into the Wii's lifespan, when people were drowning in party games.
* It was **published quietly by Activision**, who gave it zero marketing, zero hype, and probably printed a tiny number of copies.
* It **looked like shovelware (even though it very much was not)**, so even people who saw it probably skipped it.
* And it had **no recognizable characters**, story, or brand to hook casual players.

It was dumped on shelves during the era when the Wii was being **flooded with low-effort minigame collections**. Some were genuinely bad. Others, like this one, were simply overlooked.

And when people passed it over for *Mario Party*, or *Wii Party*, *Arcade Zone* quietly vanished.

# 📉 Why It’s So Rare — And Why It's a Problem

Here’s the thing: *Arcade Zone* is so rare that it’s almost slipping into **lost media territory**.

* There are **no interviews with the devs**.
* There’s **no official soundtrack** — not even a rip online.
* The game has **no wiki**. No fan pages, No speedruns, No mods, Just a few gameplay clips on Youtube.
* It’s **missing from most game databases**.
* Copies are being sold on eBay for **$5–$10**, not because it's bad… but because nobody *cares*.

And that’s heartbreaking.

Because every year, more discs get scratched. Lost. Thrown away. The Wii Shop is long gone. There’s no digital version. No way to download it. When these last discs are get disc rot, and get lost… that’s it.

**A real, playable piece of gaming history disappears.**

# ⚖️ Is It Actually a Good Game?

Yes and no. Let’s be real:

# 🔻 Flaws:

* It has a **small number of mini-games**, and some feel repetitive after long sessions.
* **Visual polish is basic**. Menus are clunky. Animations are stiff.
* **Multiplayer is limited**, only working on the classic games, for the retro games, everyone simply takes turns playing.
* There’s **no narrative or in depth characters** to help casual players connect with it.
* It’s short, and some people will call it a “glorified tech demo.” (it's not, bite me)

# ✅ What’s Good:

* Every minigame is **skill-based**, fast, and replayable.
* **No RNG or waggle** nonsense — you win because you’re good.
* The **soundtrack absolutely rips**. Pure retro arcade energy.
* The **difficulty scaling** is real — especially in Master Mode.
* The Animation Style is unique, the game simply could have used Mii's, but didn't!
* It tries something different. It’s focused. And it *cares* about what it's doing.

This isn’t a forgotten masterpiece. But it’s a game that **tried to do something cool**, and didn’t get the time of day.

# 🔍 There’s Almost No Info Left

You can search the web and find:

* A couple of blurry YouTube playthroughs
* One or two sites listing it with no box art or screenshots
* No soundtrack uploads
* No dev interviews
* No preservation efforts

It’s an endangered game. And no one’s talking about it. It’s the indie coffee shop. The garage band. The student film. It wasn’t trying to be the next Mario Party. It just wanted to exist — to be something a little different in a crowded world. And now it’s dying quietly, because nobody knew to care.

# 🛠️ What You Can Do (Even If You’ve Never Played It)

If you believe in game preservation, or you love obscure lost games, **you can help keep** ***Arcade Zone*** **from vanishing**:

# 🔧 Easy Actions:

* **Upload gameplay** — record a run, or stream it on Twitch.
* **Record or rip the soundtrack** — even a direct audio capture helps.
* **Write about it** — blog posts, YouTube retrospectives, TikToks, forum threads. Just *mention it*.
* **Scan and upload** the box art, manual, or disc to MobyGames or Internet Archive.
* **Add info to Lost Media Wiki or** [r/GamePreservation](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamePreservation/).
* **Tag posts** with #ArcadeZone #WiiHiddenGems #GamePreservation.

# 🔥Advanced Actions:

* Contact the composer **Linas Maknys** and ask about unreleased tracks.
* Reach out to Activision (yeah, a stretch — but who knows).
* Dump the ISO for long-term archival purposes.
* Submit it to retro game archives or preservation-focused YouTubers.

# 💬 Most Importantly:

**Talk about it.** Comment. Share your memories. Ask around. Even a single Reddit post like this one adds to the record.

Because if we don’t talk about it… it disappears.

# ❤️ Final Thoughts

I’m not claiming *Arcade Zone* is a secret masterpiece. It’s not. It’s flawed. It’s short. It looks cheap. It’s shovelware *adjacent*.

But someone out there **tried**.  
Someone put effort into the gameplay.  
Someone composed a legit awesome soundtrack.  
Someone wanted this game to *mean* something — even if it never did to the masses.

To me, it did.

It was *my* party game. Not Mario. Not Rabbids. Not Wii Party.

And now I feel like I’m one of the last people alive who remembers it.

So I’m writing this not to hype it up… but to **save it**. To put a pin in it. So that in 5 years, or 20 years, or 50 years — someone can look back and say, *“Yeah, that game existed. Someone cared.”*

I know like Nobody is gonna view this post, but I just wanted to share it because I hope that this will reach at least ONE scroller who takes time in their day to read this, and for me, that makes me happy knowing my childhood game gets love.

Thanks for reading. 🕹️

Most people grew up with *Mario Party*. Some had *Wii Party*, *Rayman Raving Rabbids*, or *Carnival Games*.

But for me? It was *Arcade Zone*.

A game that came and went so fast, barely anyone remembers it existed. But I do. And I still own it. It was *my* party game, my go-to multiplayer title — not because it was perfect, but because it had soul.

Now, in 2025, it’s not just forgotten. It’s **almost extinct**.

So here’s everything you should know about *Arcade Zone*. Why it’s rare. Why it flopped. What’s actually great about it. What’s not. And why, even as a flawed shovelware game, it deserves to be remembered.

# 🕹️ What Even Is Arcade Zone?

*Arcade Zone* was a Wii game released by Activision in 2009, during the height of the Wii's party-game boom. It’s a collection of skill-based mini-games designed to look and feel like classic arcade cabinets — fast, flashy, and twitchy.

But unlike most Wii party games, *Arcade Zone* wasn’t about waggling or luck. It was about **reflexes, timing, and rhythm**.

Some of the included games / gameplay types:

* **Retro homages**: Titles like *Freeway*, *Megamania*, *Atlantis*, and *Kaboom!, all old Atari 2600 games from the 80's,* are reimagined in this compilation. 
* **Ticket redemption style games**: Think “whack-a-mole” (Critter Hitter), air hockey, target shooting at pirate ships, etc.
* **Vendor mini-games**: The cooking / food prep tasks (pizza, corn dogs, smoothies) are basic yet fun — e.g. use the pointer to perform steps under a time limit.
* **Arcade Master showdown**: Once you’ve collected enough medals, you fight the Arcade Master in a final challenge (for example, an air hockey match). Then, you unlock the “grand prize” game *Kaboom!*.

In many cases, the “retro” games aren’t strict emulations — they are more like updated graphical versions that retain the spirit of the originals. The game also has an absolutely **underrated electronic soundtrack**, composed by **Linas Maknys**, that gives it a vibrant, futuristic, synth-heavy atmosphere. Honestly, the soundtrack alone sets it apart from 90% of Wii shovelware.

It’s fun. It’s fast. And when you dig past its rough exterior, there’s something *special* under the surface.

# 💔 Why Did It Flop? 

Because *Arcade Zone* had everything going against it.

* It came out in **2009**, years into the Wii's lifespan, when people were drowning in party games.
* It was **published quietly by Activision**, who gave it zero marketing, zero hype, and probably printed a tiny number of copies.
* It **looked like shovelware (even though it very much was not)**, so even people who saw it probably skipped it.
* And it had **no recognizable characters**, story, or brand to hook casual players.

It was dumped on shelves during the era when the Wii was being **flooded with low-effort minigame collections**. Some were genuinely bad. Others, like this one, were simply overlooked.

And when people passed it over for *Mario Party*, or *Wii Party*, *Arcade Zone* quietly vanished.

# 📉 Why It’s So Rare — And Why It's a Problem

Here’s the thing: *Arcade Zone* is so rare that it’s almost slipping into **lost media territory**.

* There are **no interviews with the devs**.
* There’s **no official soundtrack** — not even a rip online.
* The game has **no wiki**. No fan pages, No speedruns, No mods, Just a few gameplay clips on Youtube.
* It’s **missing from most game databases**.
* Copies are being sold on eBay for **$5–$10**, not because it's bad… but because nobody *cares*.

And that’s heartbreaking.

Because every year, more discs get scratched. Lost. Thrown away. The Wii Shop is long gone. There’s no digital version. No way to download it. When these last discs are get disc rot, and get lost… that’s it.

**A real, playable piece of gaming history disappears.**

# ⚖️ Is It Actually a Good Game?

Yes and no. Let’s be real:

# 🔻 Flaws:

* It has a **small number of mini-games**, and some feel repetitive after long sessions.
* **Visual polish is basic**. Menus are clunky. Animations are stiff.
* **Multiplayer is limited**, only working on the classic games, for the retro games, everyone simply takes turns playing.
* There’s **no narrative or in depth characters** to help casual players connect with it.
* It’s short, and some people will call it a “glorified tech demo.” (it's not, bite me)

# ✅ What’s Good:

* Every minigame is **skill-based**, fast, and replayable.
* **No RNG or waggle** nonsense — you win because you’re good.
* The **soundtrack absolutely rips**. Pure retro arcade energy.
* The **difficulty scaling** is real — especially in Master Mode.
* The Animation Style is unique, the game simply could have used Mii's, but didn't!
* It tries something different. It’s focused. And it *cares* about what it's doing.

This isn’t a forgotten masterpiece. But it’s a game that **tried to do something cool**, and didn’t get the time of day.

# 🔍 There’s Almost No Info Left

You can search the web and find:

* A couple of blurry YouTube playthroughs
* One or two sites listing it with no box art or screenshots
* No soundtrack uploads
* No dev interviews
* No preservation efforts

It’s an endangered game. And no one’s talking about it. It’s the indie coffee shop. The garage band. The student film. It wasn’t trying to be the next Mario Party. It just wanted to exist — to be something a little different in a crowded world. And now it’s dying quietly, because nobody knew to care.

At first I thought it was improper fixing or particulates in my blix, so for this roll I filtered the dev and blix through a coffee filter. However the pictures came out the same. When I compared my negatives to lab negatives I noticed the lab's are smooth but mine appear to almost be pitted (there's some kind of 3D texture to the emulsion when viewed off angle--hard to see in the phone photo through the loupe here).

Any idea what might be causing this? I use distilled water for the rinse and stabilizer, and a film squeegee to clear off the negative after stabilizing. My B&W negatives show less of this (especially 120), but after going through several older rolls it seems to be present in all my home dev rolls to some degree.

It was the one night in a month that Timothy Grant and I could be intimate.

 

I accidentally let out a soft gasp, and all desire faded from his cold eyes. He said, “Josie, you broke the rules.”

 

He quickly pulled away, threw on a bathrobe, and headed to the bathroom. Left alone on the bed, I closed my eyes in shame and embarrassment.

 

Everything had changed three years ago, after our first child passed away. Back then, under the pretext of laying her soul to rest, Timothy had built a private chapel in our villa, where incense would burn year-round as he prayed to the heavens.

 

He said those who were religious had to avoid indulgence, and he limited our intimacy to once a month at most. That wasn’t all, though. I wasn’t allowed to make any indecent sounds during our time together, lest it offend the sacred.

 

Even though I was only 25 and had needs, I could only comply with his rules.

 

…

 

Timothy left the house in the middle of the night.

 

Not long after, I got a call from my best friend, Ruby Slater. She sounded frantic on the other end of the line. “Josie, check the trending searches! Why does the sugar daddy exposed with Yasmin Beech look so much like Timothy?”

 

My mind went blank the moment I checked the trending topics. It felt like something had exploded within me.

 

“Breaking News! Rising Star Yasmin Beech Suspected of Having a Sugar Daddy to Help Her Climb the Ranks! Identity of Backer Still Unconfirmed! Stay Tuned!”

 

The photo only showed a blurry figure from behind, but how could I not recognize my own husband? His right hand, which was always adorned with a rosary, was wrapped around Yasmin’s slender waist as they entered a hotel together.

 

Just then, I received two anonymous emails. A flood of high-definition photos filled my phone screen. The first showed Timothy on one knee, holding a delicate young girl in a puffy dress in his arms. He allowed her to wrap her arms around his neck and kiss his cheek.

 

The second showed Yasmin reaching out to brush dust off Timothy’s shoulder. Instead of coldly pushing her away like he did with me, he indulged her with a slight, permissive smile.

 

The dozens of photos finally made it clear that his growing devotion to his religion over the past three years wasn’t the reason for his increasing distance from me.

 

It was because he was cheating.

 

My nails dug into my palms as I took deep breaths, forcing myself to stay calm as I opened the second email. It was a single line of text.

 

“Mrs. Grant, do you want to expose this, or will you buy the photos out for ten million dollars?”

 

“I’ll buy them out.”

 

I sent the reply, then used every penny in my bank account to buy the photos that could ruin Timothy and Yasmin. The ironic thing was that the money came from the wedding gifts Timothy had given me when we got married.

 

Now, it was being used to buy evidence of his betrayal.

 

I kept staring at the young girl in the photos. If our child hadn’t died, she’d be about the same age as this girl. Unfortunately, I never even got to see her face before she was turned into a handful of ashes in a tiny urn.

 

Back then, while I drowned in my grief, all Timothy said was a flippant, “We’ll always have more children.”

 

Now, I knew that we never would.

 

After securing the photos, I called Ruby. “Do you know any lawyers? I want to get a divorce.”

 

Since Timothy was tainted, I no longer wanted him.

 

Ruby got back to me after asking around. The lawyer drafted a divorce agreement, but since we didn’t know the full extent of Timothy’s assets, the property division couldn’t be finalized.

 

I said, “Just send me the divorce agreement for now. I’ll negotiate the property division with him later.”

 

After all, those photos had only cost me ten million dollars. The reputation of Grant Corporation’s CEO was worth far more than that. As long as I held evidence of Timothy’s infidelity, I didn’t need to worry about the property division not going my way.

 

I printed the divorce agreement and placed it on the coffee table. Then, I dialed Timothy’s number. The call was soon picked up.

 

“Is something wrong, Ms. York? Tim is busy comforting our daughter.”

 

The sweet, syrupy voice sounded polite, but it pierced my ears like an iron spike. It seemed that Yasmin was aware of my existence.

 

I had wondered if Timothy had deceived her by pretending to be single, but it turned out she was willingly playing the mistress!

 

I had no interest in wasting my time and breath on someone like her. So, I said icily, “Put Timothy on the line.”

 

“I’m sorry, but our daughter is clinging to him, and he’s tied up right now. You can tell me whatever it is you need to say, and I’ll pass along the message.” Her tone was still soft and gentle.

 

Right after she spoke, I heard a young girl’s voice ring out. “Daddy, will I still see you tomorrow morning? You always disappear for no reason.”

 

Timothy tenderly reassured her. “Of course. I promise I’ll still be here in the morning.”

 

My heart clenched. How long had it been since I’d heard him speak to me with such warmth?

 

“Ms. York, is there anything else? We need to go to bed soon.” Yasmin’s seemingly polite words were laced with venom.

1nxnkae,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nxnkae/echo/,Echo,"I was the first one in the office, as usual. The fluorescent lights hummed to life above me, casting a sterile, gray light over my desk. I grabbed a hot cup of eternally stale tasting coffee and settled in, the clatter of my keyboard echoing in the empty space. Another early morning, another spreadsheet. My mornings were filled with invoices from suppliers like ""Bob's Bolts & Widgets"" and ""Sally's Sawdust & Sundries,"" and my afternoons were a blur of double-checking expense reports and reconciling petty cash. There were no high-stakes mergers, no million dollar deals. Just a steady stream of small transactions and the comforting certainty that two plus two would always, always equal four. My biggest challenge of the week was usually trying to find the missing five cents from the last delivery order for a new shipment of widgets. I was a cog in a corporate machine, and frankly, I was content with that.

An hour later, other people started trickling in. I didn't look up until I felt a presence. I glanced over my cubicle wall and saw the single HR person we had, Brenda. She was usually a whirlwind of cheerful chaos, and today was no different. She practically sprinted over once she saw me and went for a high five, but she completely whiffed, her hand slapping nothing but air a good foot away from mine. ""Morning!"" she chirped, her voice a little too loud for nine in the morning on a Tuesday. She readjusted her stance and tried again, and this time our palms made a loud, satisfying smack. ""There we go!"" she said with a triumphant smile. ""How's my favorite numbers guy doing? You hear about the new coffee creamer? It's hazelnut! Can you believe it?""

I muttered a reply about it being a good start to the day, and she nodded vigorously, her curly red hair bouncing with the motion. After a minute or two of this one sided exchange about office supply wonders, she zipped off to her desk, leaving me to my spreadsheets and the faint smell of hazelnut.

A few moments later, I looked up from my monitor and glanced across the room near Brenda’s cubicle, just to see who her next victim was. She was standing perfectly still, her hands clasped behind her back, already staring at me. My heart gave a little jolt. It was a normal thing to look at someone, but her gaze was so intense. I quickly gave her a small smile and a nod. Brenda's face slowly twisted into a mimic of my own. She nodded back, her eyes wide and unblinking, the smile not quite reaching them. It was the sort of smile you’d see on a doll. Her gaze was fixed, unwavering. I quickly looked back down at my screen, the comforting numbers no longer feeling so certain.

A shadow fell over my monitor. I looked up, and Brenda was there, standing right next to my desk. But it wasn't Brenda. The pale face was still there, but the smile had twisted into something ugly, a sneer that showed all of her teeth. Her eyes, wide and unblinking, were fixed on me. And then she lunged. There was no warning, no scream, just the sickening crack of her hand hitting my jaw. I fell backward in my chair, scrambling to get away, but she was on me in a flash. My mug went flying, and hot coffee scalded my leg, but I barely registered the pain. All I could feel was the weight of her body on mine, the smell of hazelnut returning, and the cold, unyielding strength of her hands around my throat. The humming of the lights above me grew louder, higher, until it was the only sound in the world. I clawed at her hands, but they were unyielding, like a vise. The air left my lungs in a final, wheezing gasp, and the edges of my vision started to go gray.

Then, a shout. ""Brenda! What are you doing?"" It was Gary from marketing. I heard a thud and the scrape of a chair. Another person, Melissa the office admin, was there too. I felt a jarring tug and a brief moment of blessed relief as Brenda's hands were ripped from my throat. I gulped in air, my lungs burning. I lay there, gasping, as Gary and Melissa struggled to hold Brenda back.

Brenda wasn't fighting them, not really. She was limp, her head lolling. Her ugly sneer was gone, replaced by a look of utter bewilderment. When they finally managed to get her a few feet away, she just stood there, her hands clasped together, trembling. Her pale face was now a mask of confusion, her wide eyes darting from me, sprawled on the floor, to the two people holding her.

""Why am I...?"" she whispered, her voice small and shaky. ""What...?"" She looked at her hands, then at me. A wave of understanding seemed to wash over her. Her eyes welled up with tears. ""Oh my god... what did I do? I'm so sorry, I don't...""

Melissa was trying to figure out what had just happened, her brow furrowed in confusion, and Gary was helping me up. My neck ached and there were red welts on my throat, but I wasn't really hurt. I was just... shaken. As I stood there, leaning against my desk, watching Brenda, I couldn't bring myself to be angry. The look of genuine horror and remorse on her face was heartbreaking. It was clear she wasn't herself. I knew that if I told them what had really happened, she'd be fired, maybe even arrested. She'd lose everything.

""It's okay,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""It's a mistake. She just... slipped and fell. It was an accident.""

Everyone looked at me like I was crazy, their eyes darting from the fresh marks on my throat to the wild, panicked look on Brenda's face. Gary opened his mouth to protest, but I held his gaze, my stare daring him to contradict me. ""She tripped,"" I insisted, the words feeling foreign and clumsy on my tongue. ""Lost her balance. She reached out to grab me so she wouldn't fall, that's all. I'm fine. She's fine."" My voice was a little stronger now, a little more convincing. ""It was a total accident.""

Melissa looked from me to Brenda and back again, her expression slowly shifting from confusion to grudging acceptance. Gary, still supporting me, just shook his head slightly, but he didn't say anything. I wasn't going to be the reason her life was ruined. Not when she had no idea what she'd done. Not when she was more scared than I was.

""I'm fine,"" I repeated one last time. ""Really. It was just an accident.""

I finished filling out the incident report, lying through my teeth about the ""accident."" Melissa and Gary had shot me a few more skeptical looks, but they didn't press the issue. Brenda, tearful and still confused, had been sent home early. The rest of the day was a blur of quiet whispers and pointed glances. I tried to bury myself in my work, but the spreadsheet on my monitor might as well have been a foreign language. The burning on my throat was a constant reminder of what had happened.

Just as I was starting to feel the day might actually end, a shadow fell over my desk. I looked up and saw Franco, the building's oldest janitor. He was a small, wiry guy from somewhere in Eastern Europe, with a perpetually worried expression and a faint accent. He'd been with the company longer than anyone, and we had a weird little friendship based on mutual respect and shared early mornings.

""Ay, my friend,"" he said, his usual greeting. ""You look tired. Too much of this..."" He gestured vaguely at the computer screens around us.

I managed a weak smile. ""Just a long day, Franco. You know how it is.""

""Ah, yes. I know."" He leaned on his broom, his small frame looking weary. ""My grandson, he is doing this now. All day, in front of the screen. I tell him, 'go outside, feel the sun,' but he says the sun is not in his 'social media feeds.'"" He laughed, a dry, rattling sound. ""I don't know what this 'feeds' are, but they sound like they are making people fat.""

I chuckled. ""Tell me about it. We all need to get out more.""

""What is this?"" he asked, his voice now laced with concern, and he pointed a gnarled finger at the red marks on my throat. ""Did you fall? You have a mark like you were fighting with a cat.""

I quickly pulled my collar up, a little embarrassed by the attention. ""Oh, that?"" I said, trying for a casual tone. ""Yeah, something like that. I was helping Brenda with something earlier and she tripped. It's nothing.""

Franco didn't look convinced, but he didn't press. ""Ah, yes,"" he said, shaking his head. ""Office work. So dangerous. First, it is the paper cuts. Then, the fighting with the cats. Maybe you need to get a helmet for the office, my friend. It is a crazy place."" He laughed, a dry, rattling sound.

He nodded somberly. ""Yes. The world outside, it is still there. Even when the cubicles are not."" He gave me a quick smile, a flash of gold in his teeth, then started to move on, his janitor's cart jingling behind him.

I returned to my work, the brief distraction a welcome reprieve. But then I felt the shadow again, and a cold dread filled my stomach. I looked up, and Franco was standing there, his face unreadable. He held  one of the tools he kept on his cart. A small box cutter, its razor sharp blade extended. ""Franco?"" I asked, my voice a whisper. ""What's up?""

His eyes, usually filled with a gentle warmth, were vacant. The friendly crinkles around them were gone. Without a word, he lunged forward, the box cutter a glint of silver in his hand. I tried to pull back, but he was too fast. The first slash caught my forearm, tearing through my cream colored shirt and into my flesh. I screamed, scrambling to get away, but his hand followed, the blade carving another bloody groove in my skin. The pain was immediate and blinding. I kicked out, my chair scraping backward, trying to create distance, but he was on me, his small body an unexpected engine of violence. The blade came down again and again, leaving a burning trail of red. I screamed, a raw sound of terror and agony, as the world dissolved into a sickening mix of bright lights and sharp pain.

I fell backward in my chair, the momentum carrying me away from the slashing blade. My scream echoed through the office, a desperate, animal sound. The pain in my arms was a fire, and I saw bright red lines blossoming on my skin, blood welling up and running down my arms. I scrambled on the floor, trying to put my desk between us. Franco stood there, the box cutter dripping, His face a mix between searing hatred and utter disassociation. Gripping the desk, Franco flung his body over the table, his stained work suit a blur coming at me. His body collided with mine and we tumbled to the ground. I felt the blade find its way into my forearm as he slashed at my throat, my hand instinctually guarding my bruised neck. I grabbed his arm with my other and tried pulling the blade away. He was way stronger than his build would suggest. The force of his one arm was more than my body could fight. The blade inched closer to my neck, the tip poking the skin covering my Adams apple. I looked up at his face, his eyes almost meeting mine, but not quite. His mouth, a tight snarl, reintroducing those gold teeth. His lips moved and his mouth opened, words forming in a wheezy, deep voice; “You don’t be-” before he was pulled away by Gary and Clarence, a dark skinned man who worked in maintenance with Franco. He didn’t fight them. His body went limp and he stumbled back, his face now a mask of utter confusion. His eyes, just moments ago vacant and terrifying, were wide and filled with a frantic panic.

""Wha... no, no, no,"" he whispered, his hands trembling as he stared at the bloody blade. He looked at me, then down at my arms, and his face crumbled. ""What... what have I done?"" He dropped the box cutter, and it clattered to the floor. Other coworkers were yelling, someone was on the phone, and Gary was holding a wadded-up jacket to my arm.

The next few hours were a dizzying blur of sirens, bright lights, and the sting of antiseptic. At the hospital, doctors stitched up the cuts on my arms, wrapping them in thick bandages. My boss, a perpetually stressed man named Mr. Henderson, came to see me. He looked more concerned with liability than my well-being, but he granted me a month's medical leave, insisting I take time to rest.

I left the hospital the next day with my arms bandaged and my mind reeling. The cuts weren't too deep, but they hurt like hell, a constant throbbing reminder of the violence. The doctors prescribed some pain medication, but it did little to numb the ache in my heart. The whole thing felt like a nightmare, and for the next two days, I didn't leave my apartment. I binged old movies, ordered pizza, and tried to make sense of the look on Franco's face as he stared at the bloody box cutter, a look of pure, shocking horror.

I kept checking my phone, but Brenda hadn't replied to my Team's message. The little red ""unread"" icon sat next to her name, a persistent reminder. My inbox, however, was full of messages from concerned coworkers. *You okay, man?* Gary had asked. *I heard what happened. Seriously, are you okay?* Melissa had messaged me with a similar sentiment.

Then there were the theories. Brian from IT messaged me saying he'd heard the building used to be an old sanitarium and was haunted. Melissa sent me a link to an article about a rare mental condition that can cause people to have violent episodes they don't remember. They were crazy, but I had no better answers.

I wanted to call Brenda. To hear her happy voice, to make sure she was okay. But every time I went to dial her number, I hesitated. What would I say? ""Hey, Brenda, just checking in after your violent episode and my subsequent attack by the janitor?"" It felt ridiculous. I was considering hitting the dial button when my ringtone pierced the silence. “Hello?” I say, putting the phone to my ear. The voice on the other end was a police officer, polite but firm. He introduced himself and said he was calling about the incident at work. They needed me to come down to give a statement about the assault.

I dressed in a long sleeved shirt to hide the bandages, got in my car, and rode in silence, the city lights blurring past. The police station was sterile and smelled of old coffee, much like my office. They led me into a small, windowless room and sat me down opposite a detective with tired eyes.

I told them everything, leaving out no detail. The high-five with Brenda, the blank look in her eyes, my lie to protect her, Franco's sudden, vacant expression, his terrifying attack, the brief moment of clarity, the whispered words: ""You don't be-."" The detective listened, his expression unreadable, scribbling notes on a pad.

He asked me to repeat parts, to clarify others. He asked about my relationship with Franco. He asked about Franco’s motive. I explained our friendship, and told him Franco's actions made no sense. He seemed to find my answers insufficient, his skepticism clear in the way he looked at me, as if I were holding something back.

After what felt like an eternity, he closed his notebook and leaned forward, his voice a low rumble. ""We have to tell you something,"" he said, and my stomach dropped. ""Franco took his own life in his cell yesterday. He was found yesterday morning."" The words hit me like a physical blow. Franco, a man who joked about urinal cakes and worried about his grandson. Franco, who had looked at me with such genuine horror after he dropped the box cutter. My mind flashed back to the way his body went limp, the way the terror had returned to his eyes. He had been so confused, so remorseful. He had no idea what he had done. And now he is gone. I felt a wave of nausea, the world swaying around me.

The detective’s gaze was still on me, and he saw the shock on my face. He waited for a moment before continuing, his voice softening just a bit. ""There's something else you should know. We got a call from a neighbor yesterday. They found another one of your coworkers. Brenda.""

I went cold. The name hung in the air, heavy and silent. The little red ""unread"" icon on my phone, the unblinking eyes, it all rushed back.

""She was found in her apartment,"" the detective continued, his voice low. ""Same as Franco. She took her own life. We believe it happened around the same time.""

“Did they leave a note?” I muttered.

""No note,"" the officer said, his voice flat. ""No reason. People get scared, though. He was an old guy, a foreigner, in a strange place, locked up. Guilt, fear... it can get to a person. And you know, the body count in a place like this is a lot higher than the body count out there."" He gestured vaguely toward the street. ""Happens all the time.""

I walked to my car in a daze, the cold air doing little to clear my head. My arms throbbed beneath the bandages, but the physical pain was nothing compared to the gnawing ache in my gut. What had happened to them? What could have caused two kind, decent people to snap so violently, so completely out of character? The officer's words echoed in my mind: *Guilt, fear... it can get to a person. Happens all the time.* But that didn't feel right. It wasn't an answer. It was just a way to dismiss the horror of it all. I sat in my car, staring at the empty street, my mind a blank of confusion and sorrow. I felt completely, utterly helpless. I had no idea what was going on, or why it had happened, or what I was supposed to do now. All I knew was that two innocent people were gone.

I had just pulled into my apartment complex when my phone buzzed. It was a text from Sarah, a girl I'd been talking to for a few weeks. She was a graphic designer, witty and sarcastic, and a welcome distraction from the spiraling chaos of my life. She wanted to know if I was free to finally get that drink we'd been talking about. I hesitated, looking down at my bandaged arms. The last thing I wanted was to explain the truth. I quickly typed a reply, agreeing to meet for dinner instead, and suggested a place with a patio, so I could wear a jacket without looking suspicious.

The next weekend, I sat across from her at a small table on the patio of an Italian restaurant. The evening air was cool and filled with the scent of garlic and woodfire pizza. A gentle hum of conversation and laughter from the tables around us blended with the city noise, the distant wail of a siren, the rumble of a passing bus, the murmur of a couple walking by. The physical pain in my arms had lessened, but the ache in my heart remained.

Sarah was even more beautiful in person than in her profile picture. She had bright, intelligent eyes and a smile that seemed to light up her entire face. We fell into an easy rhythm of conversation, trading stories about our jobs, our pasts, and our hopes for the future. The weight of the last few days began to lift, replaced by a quiet, simple joy. We talked for hours, the plates of pasta between us growing cold as we laughed and shared. It felt normal. It felt good. For the first time in what felt like a long time, I wasn't thinking about Franco, or Brenda, or the terrified look in their eyes. I was just there, with Sarah, the noise of the city, a comforting blanket of sound around us.

I was laughing at something Sarah said when I saw him. A homeless man, several tables down and across the sidewalk, was weaving through the foot traffic, a crumpled cup in his hand. He was talking to people, asking for spare change, his movements a bit jerky and frantic. My eyes met his for a split second, and I quickly looked away, not wanting the awkwardness to seep into our perfect little bubble. I took a sip of my water, pretending to be engrossed in my conversation with Sarah. The city noise continued around us, a constant, comforting presence.

After a few moments, something made me look back up. The man was no longer moving. He was standing perfectly still, his crumpled cup forgotten at his side, his head tilted slightly to the right. He was staring directly at me, his eyes wide and vacant. The life and desperation that had been in them just moments ago were completely gone. The blank expression, the unblinking gaze, the doll-like stillness, it was the same look I had seen on Brenda's face, the same one I had seen on Franco's. The city noise, which had been so comforting, now felt distant, muted. A cold dread, a familiar one, filled my stomach. I gave a small, nervous smile and a nod, but the man didn't react. He just stood there, staring.

He began walking. Slowly at first, then his pace quickened. He wove through the people on the sidewalk, a single minded missile with no sense of his surroundings. His eyes never left me. Sarah, still laughing, had no idea what was happening behind her. I felt my hands ball into fists under the table, my body tensing. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat of panic. He was getting closer, his gaze unblinking, his face a mask of nothing. He reached the corner and stepped off the curb, crossing the street without looking for traffic.

A sharp blare of a horn, a screech of tires, and then a sickening thud. The homeless man was struck by a black car and tumbled to the asphalt in a broken heap. The world exploded into sound and chaos. The car's alarm wailed. People screamed. Sarah gasped and turned, her hand flying to her mouth. The driver jumped out of his car, yelling. Someone was already on the phone with 911.

The perfect date was over. We paid our bill in a stunned silence and walked away from the commotion. As we said goodbye, a block away from the scene, the pleasant evening we'd shared was overshadowed by the horror. I gave her a weak smile, a silent apology for the way the night had ended. ""I'll call you,"" she said, her voice shaky. I nodded, watching her walk away, and knew she wouldn't. The world, which had felt so normal for a few hours, had once again revealed its jagged, terrifying edges.

After that night, the world felt like a constant threat. Every time I saw someone staring, or acting strangely, my heart would leap into my throat. I stopped going to my usual coffee shop, started taking different routes to the grocery store, and even considered quitting my job, a useless thought since I was on leave. The fear was a living, breathing thing inside me, a parasite feeding on my sanity.

My mind replayed the events, searching for a pattern. Brenda's vacant stare, Franco's empty eyes as he lunged, the homeless man's unblinking gaze as he walked into traffic. The one thing they all had in common was the moment of **eye contact**. I was sure of it. It wasn't some random mental illness or a haunting; it was me. Something about me, something about looking into my eyes, was the trigger. I was the one causing this. It felt like a curse, a twisted form of a disease I was unknowingly spreading.

This new, terrifying belief made the idea of a doctor's visit a whole new level of panic. How could I go to a hospital, a place filled with sick, tired, and vulnerable people, and not make eye contact with someone? The simple act of checking in, or being in the waiting room, or even talking to a nurse felt like a death sentence. But the cuts on my arms were starting to get infected. I had to go.

I chose to go late, hoping to avoid the crowds. The hospital waiting room was eerily quiet, the sterile hum of the air conditioning the only sound. I kept my head down, my gaze fixed on my shoes, occasionally glancing at the worn out magazines on the table. The sunglasses on my face made it hard to see the text. A nurse called my name, and I followed her down a long hallway. We passed a room with its door propped open and I caught a quick glimpse of its occupant. A man, completely wrapped in a white meshy kind of material. My heart skipped a beat, and I accidentally made eye contact. His eyes were soft and unblinking, like his eyelids were stuck to his forehead. I quickly snapped my head down, the sudden motion startling the nurse. 

Once in the exam room, the doctor checked my arms and assured me that I was healing properly. He told me to come back in a couple weeks to get my stitches out. As I walked out, I had to ask, ""that man with the bandages, what happened to him?"" The doc, with a sad expression, responded, ""He was in a fire. Third degree burns over ninety percent of his body. It's a miracle he's still with us."" I thanked him and let myself out of the room, walking back the way I came.

I was doing my best to avoid looking at anyone when I heard it. A series of shouts accompanied by a wet, slapping sound. My heart seized, and I turned back. The burned man was already moving down the hall, a twisted marionette in the white mesh. His body was stiff, his movements a jerky, unnatural sprint. Tubes and wires dangled from his arms and chest, bouncing with each step. The flesh around his knees and thighs tore and bled with each stride as his stiff body struggled with the motion. I froze, my feet rooted to the floor. His vacant eyes were fixed on me, a mixture of rage and desperation on his face.

The nurses behind him were shouting, their pleas for help echoing in the empty hall, but they were too far back, their movements no match for the possessed man's impossible speed.

He got to me and lunged, his body too stiff and uncoordinated to land a punch. He missed his target, but instead, his body fell to the side and he bit down on my ribs, tearing into my shirt and peeling a large chunk of skin off my body. The pain was immediate and blinding, a hot, searing agony. I screamed, trying to push him away, but his grip was like a vice. He brought his blood soaked mouth to my ear and whispered, his voice a hateful hiss, “I know what you did.” Tears streamed from his vacant eyes as he spoke, his face a mask of utter agony. Then, he was pulled away, his body writhing and convulsing, the screams sounded like a dying animal, before he collapsed on the floor. His body went limp, his eyes fluttering before going blank. He was dead.

The doctors at the hospital were baffled. They patched up my wound, a gaping tear in my side, and gave me a regimen of antibiotics and painkillers. The police were called, but I had the hospital staff write the whole thing off as a psychotic episode from a dying patient. They had no reason to believe that I was anything but a victim of random violence. 

I went home and locked the door. I didn't answer my phone, and when the food delivery guy knocked, I just stood on the other side of the door, waiting for him to leave. My apartment became my sanctuary, the one place where I could be safe from the vengeful gaze of the world. The days bled into one another, a blur of television screens and the constant ache in my side.

I had been in my apartment for a week, and the walls had started to feel like they were closing in. To distract myself from the throbbing pain in my side and the cold fear in my gut, I turned on the TV. I flipped through the channels, finally settling on a show, a lighthearted sitcom. The familiar laughter from the show's laugh track was a comfort, a small semblance of normalcy in my isolated world.

As I watched, I felt the familiar knot of dread tighten in my stomach. The characters on the screen, a group of friends sitting in a coffee shop, began to act strangely. Their dialogue became nonsensical, their movements jerky and unnatural. Their heads slowly turned, their eyes, once full of life and laughter, now empty and vacant. Their mouths unmoving as they stared directly at me, through the screen.

I gasped, fumbling for the remote, and changed the channel. But it was the same. A documentary about nature, but the animals on screen were frozen, their eyes vacant as they stared out at me. A breaking news report, but the anchors weren't speaking, just staring, their smiles wide and unmoving.

I slammed the TV off, the silence a deafening roar. I picked up my phone, my last lifeline to the outside world. I scrolled through my social media feed, but every photo, every video, every face was empty, vacant, and staring directly at me. I screamed, throwing my phone against the wall. It shattered into a dozen pieces, the screen going black. I was alone, truly alone, and there was nowhere left to hide.

Eventually, the pain in my side started to feel better, but the fear still gnawed at me. The police weren't investigating. I couldn't go to the hospital again. I had no one to talk to. I was alone with this terrible secret. My sick leave was running out, and the landlord had sent me a notice. I had to go back to work.

The thought of going back was terrifying, but the alternative was homelessness, and I knew I couldn't survive on the streets. My savings were running on fumes. The fear was a living, breathing thing, but the need for money was a far more practical, immediate threat.

I was the first one in the office, as usual. The fluorescent lights hummed to life above me, casting a sterile, gray light over my desk. I grabbed a hot cup of eternally stale tasting coffee and settled in, the clatter of my keyboard echoing in the empty space. Another early morning, another spreadsheet. I was a human cog in a corporate machine, and I was content with that. I worked on my spreadsheets, the numbers a familiar puzzle. It felt good to be back. It felt normal. I fired away, my fingers flying across the keyboard, the numbers adding up perfectly. The mundane, predictable rhythm of the job was a welcome relief from the chaos of my life. I had been through a lot, but I was still here. I was still alive. And I was going to be okay.

The thought of Franco and Brenda danced in my mind, a brief flicker of sorrow and fear, but I pushed them away. I had to focus. I was back, I was safe, and I was going to survive this. The minutes ticked by, and I lost myself in the spreadsheets, the comforting rhythm of my fingers on the keyboard. It wasn't until the clock on my computer screen hit 11:00 a.m. that I looked up. The office was still silent. No one had shown up yet. A cold dread began to creep back into my heart.

I looked out the window and saw the edges of the glass began to blur, swirling into a distorted vortex of the wall and the outside world. I stumbled back from my desk, my heart pounding, but the room was already starting to melt. The walls swirled, the desks blended into a single, formless mass, and the fluorescent lights stretched and warped like taffy. I heard a door open somewhere down the hall, followed by slow, deliberate footsteps.

I ran, my legs clumsy and numb as the floor dissolved beneath me. I bolted for the men's bathroom, the nearest sanctuary, as the world behind me began to turn to black, a ravenous void eating up the office. I slammed the door shut and fumbled with the lock on a stall, my body trembling with a fear so profound it was almost a physical weight. The world outside the bathroom disappeared with a soft, final sigh, the sudden silence more terrifying than the chaos.

I sat on the toilet, my breath coming in ragged gasps, the world outside a dead, silent space. The bathroom itself felt solid, a small island in an ocean of nothingness. Then, I heard the bathroom door open with a gentle click. A slow, steady set of footsteps echoed in the silent room.

I clamped my hands over my mouth, trying not to make a sound, but my heart was a frantic drum, a rhythm so loud I was sure the entity could hear it. The footsteps stopped in front of my stall. The silence was absolute. My body was a ball of pure, unadulterated terror.

Then, with a sound like shattering glass, the entire room exploded. The walls, the floor, the ceiling, the sink, everything, vaporized into a storm of glittering dust. I wasn't just in the room anymore; I was floating in a vast, empty space. The bathroom and the office and everything else now just a memory. In front of me now, a breathtaking sight. A man's form, but it wasn't a man. It was the universe personified. His body wasn't made of flesh and bone, but of reality itself, a swirling kaleidoscope of stars and galaxies, nebulae and cosmic dust. It was the embodiment of anything and everything, a truly terrifying and beautiful sight. I was utterly baffled, my mind struggling to comprehend the sheer beauty of the being before me. My mouth, without my permission, opened, and one question, one thought, escaped. ""What do you want?"" I whispered, my voice a pathetic, tiny sound in the vast silence.

The being tilted its head, a galaxy spiraling in the place where its ear would be. It then reached out a hand, and I was lifted by my throat. Its fingers, made of pure light, didn't burn, didn't hurt; they simply held me, my feet dangling in the void. ""ATONEMENT,"" it replied, its voice a chorus of billions of voices, the whisper of stars and the roar of supernovas, the murmur of every human who had ever lived and died.

I was no longer in control of my own mind. Images flooded my consciousness, a terrifying, rapid fire montage of my life. My faulty spreadsheets, the doctored reports, the late night arguments with Alex. I felt the cold, hard satisfaction that had filled me when I learned that the company that we built together had blown up in his face. I was forced to relive the indifference I felt when I heard he had killed his family before killing himself. I saw the text messages he had sent me, a desperate final plea for help, a final, despairing admission that he was blaming himself. ""I don't know what I did. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry."" The Universe's disembodied voice narrated every single one, its tone a perfect blend of righteous fury and a profound, bone deep sorrow. I watched in agony as the universe exposed the truth of my carefully constructed lie.

""Why are you doing this?"" I screamed, the words a tiny, insignificant plea in the cosmic void.

""You subverted the natural order,"" the voice rumbled back, its tone a little softer now, as if explaining something simple to a simple child. ""You used the perfect machine of human intellect to kill a man's future, and I am the universe. I am the balance. I tried to reach you. I tried to make you understand. The ones you saw... they were lost souls. They were already at the end of their rope. I took them. I put them somewhere better. And I used their bodies to show you the error of your ways. I tried to correct the imbalance you created.""

I dropped to my knees, the weight of a thousand star systems pressing down on me. I tried to argue, my voice a broken whisper, ""But you caused death... Brenda... Franco...""

""Their bodies were already gone,"" the Universe replied, a gentle, sad certainty in its voice. ""They were just shells, vehicles of my will. They were suffering, and I ended that suffering. I showed you the consequences of your actions through their lives and deaths. You destroyed a man with a mind so broken, so filled with guilt and sorrow, that he lost himself completely. And you did it for nothing."" The Universe paused, the light from its body dimming a little, as if in mourning. 

The being released me, sending me tumbling to the floor that used to exist, the sensation of falling a strange comfort in the impossible reality I now inhabited. The being's form wavered, the stars and galaxies that made up its body beginning to twist and churn, a final, beautiful storm. Then, a single, perfect finger of pure starlight extended from its hand, and it pointed directly at me. I didn't feel pain. I didn't feel anything. I simply dissolved, my body, my mind, my memories, everything I had ever been, erased. I was gone, a debt collected, a wrong made right.",1,1759562808.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

It was the one night in a month that Timothy Grant and I could be intimate.

 

I accidentally let out a soft gasp, and all desire faded from his cold eyes. He said, “Josie, you broke the rules.”

 

He quickly pulled away, threw on a bathrobe, and headed to the bathroom. Left alone on the bed, I closed my eyes in shame and embarrassment.

 

Everything had changed three years ago, after our first child passed away. Back then, under the pretext of laying her soul to rest, Timothy had built a private chapel in our villa, where incense would burn year-round as he prayed to the heavens.

 

He said those who were religious had to avoid indulgence, and he limited our intimacy to once a month at most. That wasn’t all, though. I wasn’t allowed to make any indecent sounds during our time together, lest it offend the sacred.

 

Even though I was only 25 and had needs, I could only comply with his rules.

 

…

 

Timothy left the house in the middle of the night.

 

Not long after, I got a call from my best friend, Ruby Slater. She sounded frantic on the other end of the line. “Josie, check the trending searches! Why does the sugar daddy exposed with Yasmin Beech look so much like Timothy?”

 

My mind went blank the moment I checked the trending topics. It felt like something had exploded within me.

 

“Breaking News! Rising Star Yasmin Beech Suspected of Having a Sugar Daddy to Help Her Climb the Ranks! Identity of Backer Still Unconfirmed! Stay Tuned!”

 

The photo only showed a blurry figure from behind, but how could I not recognize my own husband? His right hand, which was always adorned with a rosary, was wrapped around Yasmin’s slender waist as they entered a hotel together.

 

Just then, I received two anonymous emails. A flood of high-definition photos filled my phone screen. The first showed Timothy on one knee, holding a delicate young girl in a puffy dress in his arms. He allowed her to wrap her arms around his neck and kiss his cheek.

 

The second showed Yasmin reaching out to brush dust off Timothy’s shoulder. Instead of coldly pushing her away like he did with me, he indulged her with a slight, permissive smile.

 

The dozens of photos finally made it clear that his growing devotion to his religion over the past three years wasn’t the reason for his increasing distance from me.

 

It was because he was cheating.

 

My nails dug into my palms as I took deep breaths, forcing myself to stay calm as I opened the second email. It was a single line of text.

 

“Mrs. Grant, do you want to expose this, or will you buy the photos out for ten million dollars?”

 

“I’ll buy them out.”

 

I sent the reply, then used every penny in my bank account to buy the photos that could ruin Timothy and Yasmin. The ironic thing was that the money came from the wedding gifts Timothy had given me when we got married.

 

Now, it was being used to buy evidence of his betrayal.

 

I kept staring at the young girl in the photos. If our child hadn’t died, she’d be about the same age as this girl. Unfortunately, I never even got to see her face before she was turned into a handful of ashes in a tiny urn.

 

Back then, while I drowned in my grief, all Timothy said was a flippant, “We’ll always have more children.”

 

Now, I knew that we never would.

 

After securing the photos, I called Ruby. “Do you know any lawyers? I want to get a divorce.”

 

Since Timothy was tainted, I no longer wanted him.

 

Ruby got back to me after asking around. The lawyer drafted a divorce agreement, but since we didn’t know the full extent of Timothy’s assets, the property division couldn’t be finalized.

 

I said, “Just send me the divorce agreement for now. I’ll negotiate the property division with him later.”

 

After all, those photos had only cost me ten million dollars. The reputation of Grant Corporation’s CEO was worth far more than that. As long as I held evidence of Timothy’s infidelity, I didn’t need to worry about the property division not going my way.

 

I printed the divorce agreement and placed it on the coffee table. Then, I dialed Timothy’s number. The call was soon picked up.

 

“Is something wrong, Ms. York? Tim is busy comforting our daughter.”

 

The sweet, syrupy voice sounded polite, but it pierced my ears like an iron spike. It seemed that Yasmin was aware of my existence.

 

I had wondered if Timothy had deceived her by pretending to be single, but it turned out she was willingly playing the mistress!

 

I had no interest in wasting my time and breath on someone like her. So, I said icily, “Put Timothy on the line.”

 

“I’m sorry, but our daughter is clinging to him, and he’s tied up right now. You can tell me whatever it is you need to say, and I’ll pass along the message.” Her tone was still soft and gentle.

 

Right after she spoke, I heard a young girl’s voice ring out. “Daddy, will I still see you tomorrow morning? You always disappear for no reason.”

 

Timothy tenderly reassured her. “Of course. I promise I’ll still be here in the morning.”

 

My heart clenched. How long had it been since I’d heard him speak to me with such warmth?

 

“Ms. York, is there anything else? We need to go to bed soon.” Yasmin’s seemingly polite words were laced with venom.

 

I said, “Yes, there is. Tell him to come back and sign a divorce agreement!”",1,1759562799.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

I’ve been in Edinburgh for a while, almost 5 years now, I actually went to university here, and it’s kind of my base. These days I work up in the Highlands, but I come down to Edinburgh every other week and would love to make some new friends to hang out with when I’m around.

I’m into simple meetups like going for walks (Arthur’s Seat, the Meadows, Dean Village, Old town, etc.), grabbing food or coffee, photography, writing or just wandering the streets and exploring new spots. I don’t always know what to do when I’m back in the city, so it’d be nice to have some company for those chill weekends.

If that sounds like your vibe, drop a comment or message, always up for good chats, walks, and discovering more of Edinburgh!!",4,1759562780.0,Edinburgh,0,0.75,False

1nxnj78,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nxnj78/echo/,Echo,"I was the first one in the office, as usual. The fluorescent lights hummed to life above me, casting a sterile, gray light over my desk. I grabbed a hot cup of eternally stale tasting coffee and settled in, the clatter of my keyboard echoing in the empty space. Another early morning, another spreadsheet. My mornings were filled with invoices from suppliers like ""Bob's Bolts & Widgets"" and ""Sally's Sawdust & Sundries,"" and my afternoons were a blur of double-checking expense reports and reconciling petty cash. There were no high-stakes mergers, no million dollar deals. Just a steady stream of small transactions and the comforting certainty that two plus two would always, always equal four. My biggest challenge of the week was usually trying to find the missing five cents from the last delivery order for a new shipment of widgets. I was a cog in a corporate machine, and frankly, I was content with that.

An hour later, other people started trickling in. I didn't look up until I felt a presence. I glanced over my cubicle wall and saw the single HR person we had, Brenda. She was usually a whirlwind of cheerful chaos, and today was no different. She practically sprinted over once she saw me and went for a high five, but she completely whiffed, her hand slapping nothing but air a good foot away from mine. ""Morning!"" she chirped, her voice a little too loud for nine in the morning on a Tuesday. She readjusted her stance and tried again, and this time our palms made a loud, satisfying smack. ""There we go!"" she said with a triumphant smile. ""How's my favorite numbers guy doing? You hear about the new coffee creamer? It's hazelnut! Can you believe it?""

I muttered a reply about it being a good start to the day, and she nodded vigorously, her curly red hair bouncing with the motion. After a minute or two of this one sided exchange about office supply wonders, she zipped off to her desk, leaving me to my spreadsheets and the faint smell of hazelnut.

A few moments later, I looked up from my monitor and glanced across the room near Brenda’s cubicle, just to see who her next victim was. She was standing perfectly still, her hands clasped behind her back, already staring at me. My heart gave a little jolt. It was a normal thing to look at someone, but her gaze was so intense. I quickly gave her a small smile and a nod. Brenda's face slowly twisted into a mimic of my own. She nodded back, her eyes wide and unblinking, the smile not quite reaching them. It was the sort of smile you’d see on a doll. Her gaze was fixed, unwavering. I quickly looked back down at my screen, the comforting numbers no longer feeling so certain.

A shadow fell over my monitor. I looked up, and Brenda was there, standing right next to my desk. But it wasn't Brenda. The pale face was still there, but the smile had twisted into something ugly, a sneer that showed all of her teeth. Her eyes, wide and unblinking, were fixed on me. And then she lunged. There was no warning, no scream, just the sickening crack of her hand hitting my jaw. I fell backward in my chair, scrambling to get away, but she was on me in a flash. My mug went flying, and hot coffee scalded my leg, but I barely registered the pain. All I could feel was the weight of her body on mine, the smell of hazelnut returning, and the cold, unyielding strength of her hands around my throat. The humming of the lights above me grew louder, higher, until it was the only sound in the world. I clawed at her hands, but they were unyielding, like a vise. The air left my lungs in a final, wheezing gasp, and the edges of my vision started to go gray.

Then, a shout. ""Brenda! What are you doing?"" It was Gary from marketing. I heard a thud and the scrape of a chair. Another person, Melissa the office admin, was there too. I felt a jarring tug and a brief moment of blessed relief as Brenda's hands were ripped from my throat. I gulped in air, my lungs burning. I lay there, gasping, as Gary and Melissa struggled to hold Brenda back.

Brenda wasn't fighting them, not really. She was limp, her head lolling. Her ugly sneer was gone, replaced by a look of utter bewilderment. When they finally managed to get her a few feet away, she just stood there, her hands clasped together, trembling. Her pale face was now a mask of confusion, her wide eyes darting from me, sprawled on the floor, to the two people holding her.

""Why am I...?"" she whispered, her voice small and shaky. ""What...?"" She looked at her hands, then at me. A wave of understanding seemed to wash over her. Her eyes welled up with tears. ""Oh my god... what did I do? I'm so sorry, I don't...""

Melissa was trying to figure out what had just happened, her brow furrowed in confusion, and Gary was helping me up. My neck ached and there were red welts on my throat, but I wasn't really hurt. I was just... shaken. As I stood there, leaning against my desk, watching Brenda, I couldn't bring myself to be angry. The look of genuine horror and remorse on her face was heartbreaking. It was clear she wasn't herself. I knew that if I told them what had really happened, she'd be fired, maybe even arrested. She'd lose everything.

""It's okay,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""It's a mistake. She just... slipped and fell. It was an accident.""

Everyone looked at me like I was crazy, their eyes darting from the fresh marks on my throat to the wild, panicked look on Brenda's face. Gary opened his mouth to protest, but I held his gaze, my stare daring him to contradict me. ""She tripped,"" I insisted, the words feeling foreign and clumsy on my tongue. ""Lost her balance. She reached out to grab me so she wouldn't fall, that's all. I'm fine. She's fine."" My voice was a little stronger now, a little more convincing. ""It was a total accident.""

Melissa looked from me to Brenda and back again, her expression slowly shifting from confusion to grudging acceptance. Gary, still supporting me, just shook his head slightly, but he didn't say anything. I wasn't going to be the reason her life was ruined. Not when she had no idea what she'd done. Not when she was more scared than I was.

""I'm fine,"" I repeated one last time. ""Really. It was just an accident.""

I finished filling out the incident report, lying through my teeth about the ""accident."" Melissa and Gary had shot me a few more skeptical looks, but they didn't press the issue. Brenda, tearful and still confused, had been sent home early. The rest of the day was a blur of quiet whispers and pointed glances. I tried to bury myself in my work, but the spreadsheet on my monitor might as well have been a foreign language. The burning on my throat was a constant reminder of what had happened.

Just as I was starting to feel the day might actually end, a shadow fell over my desk. I looked up and saw Franco, the building's oldest janitor. He was a small, wiry guy from somewhere in Eastern Europe, with a perpetually worried expression and a faint accent. He'd been with the company longer than anyone, and we had a weird little friendship based on mutual respect and shared early mornings.

""Ay, my friend,"" he said, his usual greeting. ""You look tired. Too much of this..."" He gestured vaguely at the computer screens around us.

I managed a weak smile. ""Just a long day, Franco. You know how it is.""

""Ah, yes. I know."" He leaned on his broom, his small frame looking weary. ""My grandson, he is doing this now. All day, in front of the screen. I tell him, 'go outside, feel the sun,' but he says the sun is not in his 'social media feeds.'"" He laughed, a dry, rattling sound. ""I don't know what this 'feeds' are, but they sound like they are making people fat.""

I chuckled. ""Tell me about it. We all need to get out more.""

""What is this?"" he asked, his voice now laced with concern, and he pointed a gnarled finger at the red marks on my throat. ""Did you fall? You have a mark like you were fighting with a cat.""

I quickly pulled my collar up, a little embarrassed by the attention. ""Oh, that?"" I said, trying for a casual tone. ""Yeah, something like that. I was helping Brenda with something earlier and she tripped. It's nothing.""

Franco didn't look convinced, but he didn't press. ""Ah, yes,"" he said, shaking his head. ""Office work. So dangerous. First, it is the paper cuts. Then, the fighting with the cats. Maybe you need to get a helmet for the office, my friend. It is a crazy place."" He laughed, a dry, rattling sound.

He nodded somberly. ""Yes. The world outside, it is still there. Even when the cubicles are not."" He gave me a quick smile, a flash of gold in his teeth, then started to move on, his janitor's cart jingling behind him.

I returned to my work, the brief distraction a welcome reprieve. But then I felt the shadow again, and a cold dread filled my stomach. I looked up, and Franco was standing there, his face unreadable. He held  one of the tools he kept on his cart. A small box cutter, its razor sharp blade extended. ""Franco?"" I asked, my voice a whisper. ""What's up?""

His eyes, usually filled with a gentle warmth, were vacant. The friendly crinkles around them were gone. Without a word, he lunged forward, the box cutter a glint of silver in his hand. I tried to pull back, but he was too fast. The first slash caught my forearm, tearing through my cream colored shirt and into my flesh. I screamed, scrambling to get away, but his hand followed, the blade carving another bloody groove in my skin. The pain was immediate and blinding. I kicked out, my chair scraping backward, trying to create distance, but he was on me, his small body an unexpected engine of violence. The blade came down again and again, leaving a burning trail of red. I screamed, a raw sound of terror and agony, as the world dissolved into a sickening mix of bright lights and sharp pain.

I fell backward in my chair, the momentum carrying me away from the slashing blade. My scream echoed through the office, a desperate, animal sound. The pain in my arms was a fire, and I saw bright red lines blossoming on my skin, blood welling up and running down my arms. I scrambled on the floor, trying to put my desk between us. Franco stood there, the box cutter dripping, His face a mix between searing hatred and utter disassociation. Gripping the desk, Franco flung his body over the table, his stained work suit a blur coming at me. His body collided with mine and we tumbled to the ground. I felt the blade find its way into my forearm as he slashed at my throat, my hand instinctually guarding my bruised neck. I grabbed his arm with my other and tried pulling the blade away. He was way stronger than his build would suggest. The force of his one arm was more than my body could fight. The blade inched closer to my neck, the tip poking the skin covering my Adams apple. I looked up at his face, his eyes almost meeting mine, but not quite. His mouth, a tight snarl, reintroducing those gold teeth. His lips moved and his mouth opened, words forming in a wheezy, deep voice; “You don’t be-” before he was pulled away by Gary and Clarence, a dark skinned man who worked in maintenance with Franco. He didn’t fight them. His body went limp and he stumbled back, his face now a mask of utter confusion. His eyes, just moments ago vacant and terrifying, were wide and filled with a frantic panic.

""Wha... no, no, no,"" he whispered, his hands trembling as he stared at the bloody blade. He looked at me, then down at my arms, and his face crumbled. ""What... what have I done?"" He dropped the box cutter, and it clattered to the floor. Other coworkers were yelling, someone was on the phone, and Gary was holding a wadded-up jacket to my arm.

The next few hours were a dizzying blur of sirens, bright lights, and the sting of antiseptic. At the hospital, doctors stitched up the cuts on my arms, wrapping them in thick bandages. My boss, a perpetually stressed man named Mr. Henderson, came to see me. He looked more concerned with liability than my well-being, but he granted me a month's medical leave, insisting I take time to rest.

I left the hospital the next day with my arms bandaged and my mind reeling. The cuts weren't too deep, but they hurt like hell, a constant throbbing reminder of the violence. The doctors prescribed some pain medication, but it did little to numb the ache in my heart. The whole thing felt like a nightmare, and for the next two days, I didn't leave my apartment. I binged old movies, ordered pizza, and tried to make sense of the look on Franco's face as he stared at the bloody box cutter, a look of pure, shocking horror.

I kept checking my phone, but Brenda hadn't replied to my Team's message. The little red ""unread"" icon sat next to her name, a persistent reminder. My inbox, however, was full of messages from concerned coworkers. *You okay, man?* Gary had asked. *I heard what happened. Seriously, are you okay?* Melissa had messaged me with a similar sentiment.

Then there were the theories. Brian from IT messaged me saying he'd heard the building used to be an old sanitarium and was haunted. Melissa sent me a link to an article about a rare mental condition that can cause people to have violent episodes they don't remember. They were crazy, but I had no better answers.

I wanted to call Brenda. To hear her happy voice, to make sure she was okay. But every time I went to dial her number, I hesitated. What would I say? ""Hey, Brenda, just checking in after your violent episode and my subsequent attack by the janitor?"" It felt ridiculous. I was considering hitting the dial button when my ringtone pierced the silence. “Hello?” I say, putting the phone to my ear. The voice on the other end was a police officer, polite but firm. He introduced himself and said he was calling about the incident at work. They needed me to come down to give a statement about the assault.

I dressed in a long sleeved shirt to hide the bandages, got in my car, and rode in silence, the city lights blurring past. The police station was sterile and smelled of old coffee, much like my office. They led me into a small, windowless room and sat me down opposite a detective with tired eyes.

I told them everything, leaving out no detail. The high-five with Brenda, the blank look in her eyes, my lie to protect her, Franco's sudden, vacant expression, his terrifying attack, the brief moment of clarity, the whispered words: ""You don't be-."" The detective listened, his expression unreadable, scribbling notes on a pad.

He asked me to repeat parts, to clarify others. He asked about my relationship with Franco. He asked about Franco’s motive. I explained our friendship, and told him Franco's actions made no sense. He seemed to find my answers insufficient, his skepticism clear in the way he looked at me, as if I were holding something back.

After what felt like an eternity, he closed his notebook and leaned forward, his voice a low rumble. ""We have to tell you something,"" he said, and my stomach dropped. ""Franco took his own life in his cell yesterday. He was found yesterday morning."" The words hit me like a physical blow. Franco, a man who joked about urinal cakes and worried about his grandson. Franco, who had looked at me with such genuine horror after he dropped the box cutter. My mind flashed back to the way his body went limp, the way the terror had returned to his eyes. He had been so confused, so remorseful. He had no idea what he had done. And now he is gone. I felt a wave of nausea, the world swaying around me.

The detective’s gaze was still on me, and he saw the shock on my face. He waited for a moment before continuing, his voice softening just a bit. ""There's something else you should know. We got a call from a neighbor yesterday. They found another one of your coworkers. Brenda.""

I went cold. The name hung in the air, heavy and silent. The little red ""unread"" icon on my phone, the unblinking eyes, it all rushed back.

""She was found in her apartment,"" the detective continued, his voice low. ""Same as Franco. She took her own life. We believe it happened around the same time.""

“Did they leave a note?” I muttered.

""No note,"" the officer said, his voice flat. ""No reason. People get scared, though. He was an old guy, a foreigner, in a strange place, locked up. Guilt, fear... it can get to a person. And you know, the body count in a place like this is a lot higher than the body count out there."" He gestured vaguely toward the street. ""Happens all the time.""

I walked to my car in a daze, the cold air doing little to clear my head. My arms throbbed beneath the bandages, but the physical pain was nothing compared to the gnawing ache in my gut. What had happened to them? What could have caused two kind, decent people to snap so violently, so completely out of character? The officer's words echoed in my mind: *Guilt, fear... it can get to a person. Happens all the time.* But that didn't feel right. It wasn't an answer. It was just a way to dismiss the horror of it all. I sat in my car, staring at the empty street, my mind a blank of confusion and sorrow. I felt completely, utterly helpless. I had no idea what was going on, or why it had happened, or what I was supposed to do now. All I knew was that two innocent people were gone.

I had just pulled into my apartment complex when my phone buzzed. It was a text from Sarah, a girl I'd been talking to for a few weeks. She was a graphic designer, witty and sarcastic, and a welcome distraction from the spiraling chaos of my life. She wanted to know if I was free to finally get that drink we'd been talking about. I hesitated, looking down at my bandaged arms. The last thing I wanted was to explain the truth. I quickly typed a reply, agreeing to meet for dinner instead, and suggested a place with a patio, so I could wear a jacket without looking suspicious.

The next weekend, I sat across from her at a small table on the patio of an Italian restaurant. The evening air was cool and filled with the scent of garlic and woodfire pizza. A gentle hum of conversation and laughter from the tables around us blended with the city noise, the distant wail of a siren, the rumble of a passing bus, the murmur of a couple walking by. The physical pain in my arms had lessened, but the ache in my heart remained.

Sarah was even more beautiful in person than in her profile picture. She had bright, intelligent eyes and a smile that seemed to light up her entire face. We fell into an easy rhythm of conversation, trading stories about our jobs, our pasts, and our hopes for the future. The weight of the last few days began to lift, replaced by a quiet, simple joy. We talked for hours, the plates of pasta between us growing cold as we laughed and shared. It felt normal. It felt good. For the first time in what felt like a long time, I wasn't thinking about Franco, or Brenda, or the terrified look in their eyes. I was just there, with Sarah, the noise of the city, a comforting blanket of sound around us.

I was laughing at something Sarah said when I saw him. A homeless man, several tables down and across the sidewalk, was weaving through the foot traffic, a crumpled cup in his hand. He was talking to people, asking for spare change, his movements a bit jerky and frantic. My eyes met his for a split second, and I quickly looked away, not wanting the awkwardness to seep into our perfect little bubble. I took a sip of my water, pretending to be engrossed in my conversation with Sarah. The city noise continued around us, a constant, comforting presence.

After a few moments, something made me look back up. The man was no longer moving. He was standing perfectly still, his crumpled cup forgotten at his side, his head tilted slightly to the right. He was staring directly at me, his eyes wide and vacant. The life and desperation that had been in them just moments ago were completely gone. The blank expression, the unblinking gaze, the doll-like stillness, it was the same look I had seen on Brenda's face, the same one I had seen on Franco's. The city noise, which had been so comforting, now felt distant, muted. A cold dread, a familiar one, filled my stomach. I gave a small, nervous smile and a nod, but the man didn't react. He just stood there, staring.

He began walking. Slowly at first, then his pace quickened. He wove through the people on the sidewalk, a single minded missile with no sense of his surroundings. His eyes never left me. Sarah, still laughing, had no idea what was happening behind her. I felt my hands ball into fists under the table, my body tensing. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat of panic. He was getting closer, his gaze unblinking, his face a mask of nothing. He reached the corner and stepped off the curb, crossing the street without looking for traffic.

A sharp blare of a horn, a screech of tires, and then a sickening thud. The homeless man was struck by a black car and tumbled to the asphalt in a broken heap. The world exploded into sound and chaos. The car's alarm wailed. People screamed. Sarah gasped and turned, her hand flying to her mouth. The driver jumped out of his car, yelling. Someone was already on the phone with 911.

The perfect date was over. We paid our bill in a stunned silence and walked away from the commotion. As we said goodbye, a block away from the scene, the pleasant evening we'd shared was overshadowed by the horror. I gave her a weak smile, a silent apology for the way the night had ended. ""I'll call you,"" she said, her voice shaky. I nodded, watching her walk away, and knew she wouldn't. The world, which had felt so normal for a few hours, had once again revealed its jagged, terrifying edges.

After that night, the world felt like a constant threat. Every time I saw someone staring, or acting strangely, my heart would leap into my throat. I stopped going to my usual coffee shop, started taking different routes to the grocery store, and even considered quitting my job, a useless thought since I was on leave. The fear was a living, breathing thing inside me, a parasite feeding on my sanity.

My mind replayed the events, searching for a pattern. Brenda's vacant stare, Franco's empty eyes as he lunged, the homeless man's unblinking gaze as he walked into traffic. The one thing they all had in common was the moment of **eye contact**. I was sure of it. It wasn't some random mental illness or a haunting; it was me. Something about me, something about looking into my eyes, was the trigger. I was the one causing this. It felt like a curse, a twisted form of a disease I was unknowingly spreading.

This new, terrifying belief made the idea of a doctor's visit a whole new level of panic. How could I go to a hospital, a place filled with sick, tired, and vulnerable people, and not make eye contact with someone? The simple act of checking in, or being in the waiting room, or even talking to a nurse felt like a death sentence. But the cuts on my arms were starting to get infected. I had to go.

I chose to go late, hoping to avoid the crowds. The hospital waiting room was eerily quiet, the sterile hum of the air conditioning the only sound. I kept my head down, my gaze fixed on my shoes, occasionally glancing at the worn out magazines on the table. The sunglasses on my face made it hard to see the text. A nurse called my name, and I followed her down a long hallway. We passed a room with its door propped open and I caught a quick glimpse of its occupant. A man, completely wrapped in a white meshy kind of material. My heart skipped a beat, and I accidentally made eye contact. His eyes were soft and unblinking, like his eyelids were stuck to his forehead. I quickly snapped my head down, the sudden motion startling the nurse. 

Once in the exam room, the doctor checked my arms and assured me that I was healing properly. He told me to come back in a couple weeks to get my stitches out. As I walked out, I had to ask, ""that man with the bandages, what happened to him?"" The doc, with a sad expression, responded, ""He was in a fire. Third degree burns over ninety percent of his body. It's a miracle he's still with us."" I thanked him and let myself out of the room, walking back the way I came.

I was doing my best to avoid looking at anyone when I heard it. A series of shouts accompanied by a wet, slapping sound. My heart seized, and I turned back. The burned man was already moving down the hall, a twisted marionette in the white mesh. His body was stiff, his movements a jerky, unnatural sprint. Tubes and wires dangled from his arms and chest, bouncing with each step. The flesh around his knees and thighs tore and bled with each stride as his stiff body struggled with the motion. I froze, my feet rooted to the floor. His vacant eyes were fixed on me, a mixture of rage and desperation on his face.

The nurses behind him were shouting, their pleas for help echoing in the empty hall, but they were too far back, their movements no match for the possessed man's impossible speed.

He got to me and lunged, his body too stiff and uncoordinated to land a punch. He missed his target, but instead, his body fell to the side and he bit down on my ribs, tearing into my shirt and peeling a large chunk of skin off my body. The pain was immediate and blinding, a hot, searing agony. I screamed, trying to push him away, but his grip was like a vice. He brought his blood soaked mouth to my ear and whispered, his voice a hateful hiss, “I know what you did.” Tears streamed from his vacant eyes as he spoke, his face a mask of utter agony. Then, he was pulled away, his body writhing and convulsing, the screams sounded like a dying animal, before he collapsed on the floor. His body went limp, his eyes fluttering before going blank. He was dead.

The doctors at the hospital were baffled. They patched up my wound, a gaping tear in my side, and gave me a regimen of antibiotics and painkillers. The police were called, but I had the hospital staff write the whole thing off as a psychotic episode from a dying patient. They had no reason to believe that I was anything but a victim of random violence. 

I went home and locked the door. I didn't answer my phone, and when the food delivery guy knocked, I just stood on the other side of the door, waiting for him to leave. My apartment became my sanctuary, the one place where I could be safe from the vengeful gaze of the world. The days bled into one another, a blur of television screens and the constant ache in my side.

I had been in my apartment for a week, and the walls had started to feel like they were closing in. To distract myself from the throbbing pain in my side and the cold fear in my gut, I turned on the TV. I flipped through the channels, finally settling on a show, a lighthearted sitcom. The familiar laughter from the show's laugh track was a comfort, a small semblance of normalcy in my isolated world.

As I watched, I felt the familiar knot of dread tighten in my stomach. The characters on the screen, a group of friends sitting in a coffee shop, began to act strangely. Their dialogue became nonsensical, their movements jerky and unnatural. Their heads slowly turned, their eyes, once full of life and laughter, now empty and vacant. Their mouths unmoving as they stared directly at me, through the screen.

I gasped, fumbling for the remote, and changed the channel. But it was the same. A documentary about nature, but the animals on screen were frozen, their eyes vacant as they stared out at me. A breaking news report, but the anchors weren't speaking, just staring, their smiles wide and unmoving.

I slammed the TV off, the silence a deafening roar. I picked up my phone, my last lifeline to the outside world. I scrolled through my social media feed, but every photo, every video, every face was empty, vacant, and staring directly at me. I screamed, throwing my phone against the wall. It shattered into a dozen pieces, the screen going black. I was alone, truly alone, and there was nowhere left to hide.

Eventually, the pain in my side started to feel better, but the fear still gnawed at me. The police weren't investigating. I couldn't go to the hospital again. I had no one to talk to. I was alone with this terrible secret. My sick leave was running out, and the landlord had sent me a notice. I had to go back to work.

The thought of going back was terrifying, but the alternative was homelessness, and I knew I couldn't survive on the streets. My savings were running on fumes. The fear was a living, breathing thing, but the need for money was a far more practical, immediate threat.

I was the first one in the office, as usual. The fluorescent lights hummed to life above me, casting a sterile, gray light over my desk. I grabbed a hot cup of eternally stale tasting coffee and settled in, the clatter of my keyboard echoing in the empty space. Another early morning, another spreadsheet. I was a human cog in a corporate machine, and I was content with that. I worked on my spreadsheets, the numbers a familiar puzzle. It felt good to be back. It felt normal. I fired away, my fingers flying across the keyboard, the numbers adding up perfectly. The mundane, predictable rhythm of the job was a welcome relief from the chaos of my life. I had been through a lot, but I was still here. I was still alive. And I was going to be okay.

The thought of Franco and Brenda danced in my mind, a brief flicker of sorrow and fear, but I pushed them away. I had to focus. I was back, I was safe, and I was going to survive this. The minutes ticked by, and I lost myself in the spreadsheets, the comforting rhythm of my fingers on the keyboard. It wasn't until the clock on my computer screen hit 11:00 a.m. that I looked up. The office was still silent. No one had shown up yet. A cold dread began to creep back into my heart.

I looked out the window and saw the edges of the glass began to blur, swirling into a distorted vortex of the wall and the outside world. I stumbled back from my desk, my heart pounding, but the room was already starting to melt. The walls swirled, the desks blended into a single, formless mass, and the fluorescent lights stretched and warped like taffy. I heard a door open somewhere down the hall, followed by slow, deliberate footsteps.

I ran, my legs clumsy and numb as the floor dissolved beneath me. I bolted for the men's bathroom, the nearest sanctuary, as the world behind me began to turn to black, a ravenous void eating up the office. I slammed the door shut and fumbled with the lock on a stall, my body trembling with a fear so profound it was almost a physical weight. The world outside the bathroom disappeared with a soft, final sigh, the sudden silence more terrifying than the chaos.

I sat on the toilet, my breath coming in ragged gasps, the world outside a dead, silent space. The bathroom itself felt solid, a small island in an ocean of nothingness. Then, I heard the bathroom door open with a gentle click. A slow, steady set of footsteps echoed in the silent room.

I clamped my hands over my mouth, trying not to make a sound, but my heart was a frantic drum, a rhythm so loud I was sure the entity could hear it. The footsteps stopped in front of my stall. The silence was absolute. My body was a ball of pure, unadulterated terror.

Then, with a sound like shattering glass, the entire room exploded. The walls, the floor, the ceiling, the sink, everything, vaporized into a storm of glittering dust. I wasn't just in the room anymore; I was floating in a vast, empty space. The bathroom and the office and everything else now just a memory. In front of me now, a breathtaking sight. A man's form, but it wasn't a man. It was the universe personified. His body wasn't made of flesh and bone, but of reality itself, a swirling kaleidoscope of stars and galaxies, nebulae and cosmic dust. It was the embodiment of anything and everything, a truly terrifying and beautiful sight. I was utterly baffled, my mind struggling to comprehend the sheer beauty of the being before me. My mouth, without my permission, opened, and one question, one thought, escaped. ""What do you want?"" I whispered, my voice a pathetic, tiny sound in the vast silence.

The being tilted its head, a galaxy spiraling in the place where its ear would be. It then reached out a hand, and I was lifted by my throat. Its fingers, made of pure light, didn't burn, didn't hurt; they simply held me, my feet dangling in the void. ""ATONEMENT,"" it replied, its voice a chorus of billions of voices, the whisper of stars and the roar of supernovas, the murmur of every human who had ever lived and died.

I was no longer in control of my own mind. Images flooded my consciousness, a terrifying, rapid fire montage of my life. My faulty spreadsheets, the doctored reports, the late night arguments with Alex. I felt the cold, hard satisfaction that had filled me when I learned that the company that we built together had blown up in his face. I was forced to relive the indifference I felt when I heard he had killed his family before killing himself. I saw the text messages he had sent me, a desperate final plea for help, a final, despairing admission that he was blaming himself. ""I don't know what I did. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry."" The Universe's disembodied voice narrated every single one, its tone a perfect blend of righteous fury and a profound, bone deep sorrow. I watched in agony as the universe exposed the truth of my carefully constructed lie.

""Why are you doing this?"" I screamed, the words a tiny, insignificant plea in the cosmic void.

""You subverted the natural order,"" the voice rumbled back, its tone a little softer now, as if explaining something simple to a simple child. ""You used the perfect machine of human intellect to kill a man's future, and I am the universe. I am the balance. I tried to reach you. I tried to make you understand. The ones you saw... they were lost souls. They were already at the end of their rope. I took them. I put them somewhere better. And I used their bodies to show you the error of your ways. I tried to correct the imbalance you created.""

I dropped to my knees, the weight of a thousand star systems pressing down on me. I tried to argue, my voice a broken whisper, ""But you caused death... Brenda... Franco...""

""Their bodies were already gone,"" the Universe replied, a gentle, sad certainty in its voice. ""They were just shells, vehicles of my will. They were suffering, and I ended that suffering. I showed you the consequences of your actions through their lives and deaths. You destroyed a man with a mind so broken, so filled with guilt and sorrow, that he lost himself completely. And you did it for nothing."" The Universe paused, the light from its body dimming a little, as if in mourning. 

The being released me, sending me tumbling to the floor that used to exist, the sensation of falling a strange comfort in the impossible reality I now inhabited. The being's form wavered, the stars and galaxies that made up its body beginning to twist and churn, a final, beautiful storm. Then, a single, perfect finger of pure starlight extended from its hand, and it pointed directly at me. I didn't feel pain. I didn't feel anything. I simply dissolved, my body, my mind, my memories, everything I had ever been, erased. I was gone, a debt collected, a wrong made right.",1,1759562690.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

The fluorescent lights hummed to life above me, casting a sterile, gray light over my desk. I grabbed a hot cup of eternally stale tasting coffee and settled in, the clatter of my keyboard echoing in the empty space. Another early morning, another spreadsheet. My mornings were filled with invoices from suppliers like ""Bob's Bolts & Widgets"" and ""Sally's Sawdust & Sundries,"" and my afternoons were a blur of double-checking expense reports and reconciling petty cash. There were no high-stakes mergers, no million dollar deals. Just a steady stream of small transactions and the comforting certainty that two plus two would always, always equal four. My biggest challenge of the week was usually trying to find the missing five cents from the last delivery order for a new shipment of widgets. I was a cog in a corporate machine, and frankly, I was content with that.

An hour later, other people started trickling in. I didn't look up until I felt a presence. I glanced over my cubicle wall and saw the single HR person we had, Brenda. She was usually a whirlwind of cheerful chaos, and today was no different. She practically sprinted over once she saw me and went for a high five, but she completely whiffed, her hand slapping nothing but air a good foot away from mine. ""Morning!"" she chirped, her voice a little too loud for nine in the morning on a Tuesday. She readjusted her stance and tried again, and this time our palms made a loud, satisfying smack. ""There we go!"" she said with a triumphant smile. ""How's my favorite numbers guy doing? You hear about the new coffee creamer? It's hazelnut! Can you believe it?""

I muttered a reply about it being a good start to the day, and she nodded vigorously, her curly red hair bouncing with the motion. After a minute or two of this one sided exchange about office supply wonders, she zipped off to her desk, leaving me to my spreadsheets and the faint smell of hazelnut.

A few moments later, I looked up from my monitor and glanced across the room near Brenda’s cubicle, just to see who her next victim was. She was standing perfectly still, her hands clasped behind her back, already staring at me. My heart gave a little jolt. It was a normal thing to look at someone, but her gaze was so intense. I quickly gave her a small smile and a nod. Brenda's face slowly twisted into a mimic of my own. She nodded back, her eyes wide and unblinking, the smile not quite reaching them. It was the sort of smile you’d see on a doll. Her gaze was fixed, unwavering. I quickly looked back down at my screen, the comforting numbers no longer feeling so certain.

A shadow fell over my monitor. I looked up, and Brenda was there, standing right next to my desk. But it wasn't Brenda. The pale face was still there, but the smile had twisted into something ugly, a sneer that showed all of her teeth. Her eyes, wide and unblinking, were fixed on me. And then she lunged. There was no warning, no scream, just the sickening crack of her hand hitting my jaw. I fell backward in my chair, scrambling to get away, but she was on me in a flash. My mug went flying, and hot coffee scalded my leg, but I barely registered the pain. All I could feel was the weight of her body on mine, the smell of hazelnut returning, and the cold, unyielding strength of her hands around my throat. The humming of the lights above me grew louder, higher, until it was the only sound in the world. I clawed at her hands, but they were unyielding, like a vise. The air left my lungs in a final, wheezing gasp, and the edges of my vision started to go gray.

Then, a shout. ""Brenda! What are you doing?"" It was Gary from marketing. I heard a thud and the scrape of a chair. Another person, Melissa the office admin, was there too. I felt a jarring tug and a brief moment of blessed relief as Brenda's hands were ripped from my throat. I gulped in air, my lungs burning. I lay there, gasping, as Gary and Melissa struggled to hold Brenda back.

Brenda wasn't fighting them, not really. She was limp, her head lolling. Her ugly sneer was gone, replaced by a look of utter bewilderment. When they finally managed to get her a few feet away, she just stood there, her hands clasped together, trembling. Her pale face was now a mask of confusion, her wide eyes darting from me, sprawled on the floor, to the two people holding her.

""Why am I...?"" she whispered, her voice small and shaky. ""What...?"" She looked at her hands, then at me. A wave of understanding seemed to wash over her. Her eyes welled up with tears. ""Oh my god... what did I do? I'm so sorry, I don't...""

Melissa was trying to figure out what had just happened, her brow furrowed in confusion, and Gary was helping me up. My neck ached and there were red welts on my throat, but I wasn't really hurt. I was just... shaken. As I stood there, leaning against my desk, watching Brenda, I couldn't bring myself to be angry. The look of genuine horror and remorse on her face was heartbreaking. It was clear she wasn't herself. I knew that if I told them what had really happened, she'd be fired, maybe even arrested. She'd lose everything.

""It's okay,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""It's a mistake. She just... slipped and fell. It was an accident.""

Everyone looked at me like I was crazy, their eyes darting from the fresh marks on my throat to the wild, panicked look on Brenda's face. Gary opened his mouth to protest, but I held his gaze, my stare daring him to contradict me. ""She tripped,"" I insisted, the words feeling foreign and clumsy on my tongue. ""Lost her balance. She reached out to grab me so she wouldn't fall, that's all. I'm fine. She's fine."" My voice was a little stronger now, a little more convincing. ""It was a total accident.""

Melissa looked from me to Brenda and back again, her expression slowly shifting from confusion to grudging acceptance. Gary, still supporting me, just shook his head slightly, but he didn't say anything. I wasn't going to be the reason her life was ruined. Not when she had no idea what she'd done. Not when she was more scared than I was.

""I'm fine,"" I repeated one last time. ""Really. It was just an accident.""

I finished filling out the incident report, lying through my teeth about the ""accident."" Melissa and Gary had shot me a few more skeptical looks, but they didn't press the issue. Brenda, tearful and still confused, had been sent home early. The rest of the day was a blur of quiet whispers and pointed glances. I tried to bury myself in my work, but the spreadsheet on my monitor might as well have been a foreign language. The burning on my throat was a constant reminder of what had happened.

Just as I was starting to feel the day might actually end, a shadow fell over my desk. I looked up and saw Franco, the building's oldest janitor. He was a small, wiry guy from somewhere in Eastern Europe, with a perpetually worried expression and a faint accent. He'd been with the company longer than anyone, and we had a weird little friendship based on mutual respect and shared early mornings.

""Ay, my friend,"" he said, his usual greeting. ""You look tired. Too much of this..."" He gestured vaguely at the computer screens around us.

I managed a weak smile. ""Just a long day, Franco. You know how it is.""

""Ah, yes. I know."" He leaned on his broom, his small frame looking weary. ""My grandson, he is doing this now. All day, in front of the screen. I tell him, 'go outside, feel the sun,' but he says the sun is not in his 'social media feeds.'"" He laughed, a dry, rattling sound. ""I don't know what this 'feeds' are, but they sound like they are making people fat.""

I chuckled. ""Tell me about it. We all need to get out more.""

""What is this?"" he asked, his voice now laced with concern, and he pointed a gnarled finger at the red marks on my throat. ""Did you fall? You have a mark like you were fighting with a cat.""

I quickly pulled my collar up, a little embarrassed by the attention. ""Oh, that?"" I said, trying for a casual tone. ""Yeah, something like that. I was helping Brenda with something earlier and she tripped. It's nothing.""

Franco didn't look convinced, but he didn't press. ""Ah, yes,"" he said, shaking his head. ""Office work. So dangerous. First, it is the paper cuts. Then, the fighting with the cats. Maybe you need to get a helmet for the office, my friend. It is a crazy place."" He laughed, a dry, rattling sound.

He nodded somberly. ""Yes. The world outside, it is still there. Even when the cubicles are not."" He gave me a quick smile, a flash of gold in his teeth, then started to move on, his janitor's cart jingling behind him.

I returned to my work, the brief distraction a welcome reprieve. But then I felt the shadow again, and a cold dread filled my stomach. I looked up, and Franco was standing there, his face unreadable. He held  one of the tools he kept on his cart. A small box cutter, its razor sharp blade extended. ""Franco?"" I asked, my voice a whisper. ""What's up?""

His eyes, usually filled with a gentle warmth, were vacant. The friendly crinkles around them were gone. Without a word, he lunged forward, the box cutter a glint of silver in his hand. I tried to pull back, but he was too fast. The first slash caught my forearm, tearing through my cream colored shirt and into my flesh. I screamed, scrambling to get away, but his hand followed, the blade carving another bloody groove in my skin. The pain was immediate and blinding. I kicked out, my chair scraping backward, trying to create distance, but he was on me, his small body an unexpected engine of violence. The blade came down again and again, leaving a burning trail of red. I screamed, a raw sound of terror and agony, as the world dissolved into a sickening mix of bright lights and sharp pain.

I fell backward in my chair, the momentum carrying me away from the slashing blade. My scream echoed through the office, a desperate, animal sound. The pain in my arms was a fire, and I saw bright red lines blossoming on my skin, blood welling up and running down my arms. I scrambled on the floor, trying to put my desk between us. Franco stood there, the box cutter dripping, His face a mix between searing hatred and utter disassociation. Gripping the desk, Franco flung his body over the table, his stained work suit a blur coming at me. His body collided with mine and we tumbled to the ground. I felt the blade find its way into my forearm as he slashed at my throat, my hand instinctually guarding my bruised neck. I grabbed his arm with my other and tried pulling the blade away. He was way stronger than his build would suggest. The force of his one arm was more than my body could fight. The blade inched closer to my neck, the tip poking the skin covering my Adams apple. I looked up at his face, his eyes almost meeting mine, but not quite. His mouth, a tight snarl, reintroducing those gold teeth. His lips moved and his mouth opened, words forming in a wheezy, deep voice; “You don’t be-” before he was pulled away by Gary and Clarence, a dark skinned man who worked in maintenance with Franco. He didn’t fight them. His body went limp and he stumbled back, his face now a mask of utter confusion. His eyes, just moments ago vacant and terrifying, were wide and filled with a frantic panic.

""Wha... no, no, no,"" he whispered, his hands trembling as he stared at the bloody blade. He looked at me, then down at my arms, and his face crumbled. ""What... what have I done?"" He dropped the box cutter, and it clattered to the floor. Other coworkers were yelling, someone was on the phone, and Gary was holding a wadded-up jacket to my arm.

The next few hours were a dizzying blur of sirens, bright lights, and the sting of antiseptic. At the hospital, doctors stitched up the cuts on my arms, wrapping them in thick bandages. My boss, a perpetually stressed man named Mr. Henderson, came to see me. He looked more concerned with liability than my well-being, but he granted me a month's medical leave, insisting I take time to rest.

I left the hospital the next day with my arms bandaged and my mind reeling. The cuts weren't too deep, but they hurt like hell, a constant throbbing reminder of the violence. The doctors prescribed some pain medication, but it did little to numb the ache in my heart. The whole thing felt like a nightmare, and for the next two days, I didn't leave my apartment. I binged old movies, ordered pizza, and tried to make sense of the look on Franco's face as he stared at the bloody box cutter, a look of pure, shocking horror.

I kept checking my phone, but Brenda hadn't replied to my Team's message. The little red ""unread"" icon sat next to her name, a persistent reminder. My inbox, however, was full of messages from concerned coworkers. *You okay, man?* Gary had asked. *I heard what happened. Seriously, are you okay?* Melissa had messaged me with a similar sentiment.

Then there were the theories. Brian from IT messaged me saying he'd heard the building used to be an old sanitarium and was haunted. Melissa sent me a link to an article about a rare mental condition that can cause people to have violent episodes they don't remember. They were crazy, but I had no better answers.

I wanted to call Brenda. To hear her happy voice, to make sure she was okay. But every time I went to dial her number, I hesitated. What would I say? ""Hey, Brenda, just checking in after your violent episode and my subsequent attack by the janitor?"" It felt ridiculous. I was considering hitting the dial button when my ringtone pierced the silence. “Hello?” I say, putting the phone to my ear. The voice on the other end was a police officer, polite but firm. He introduced himself and said he was calling about the incident at work. They needed me to come down to give a statement about the assault.

I dressed in a long sleeved shirt to hide the bandages, got in my car, and rode in silence, the city lights blurring past. The police station was sterile and smelled of old coffee, much like my office. They led me into a small, windowless room and sat me down opposite a detective with tired eyes.

I told them everything, leaving out no detail. The high-five with Brenda, the blank look in her eyes, my lie to protect her, Franco's sudden, vacant expression, his terrifying attack, the brief moment of clarity, the whispered words: ""You don't be-."" The detective listened, his expression unreadable, scribbling notes on a pad.

He asked me to repeat parts, to clarify others. He asked about my relationship with Franco. He asked about Franco’s motive. I explained our friendship, and told him Franco's actions made no sense. He seemed to find my answers insufficient, his skepticism clear in the way he looked at me, as if I were holding something back.

After what felt like an eternity, he closed his notebook and leaned forward, his voice a low rumble. ""We have to tell you something,"" he said, and my stomach dropped. ""Franco took his own life in his cell yesterday. He was found yesterday morning."" The words hit me like a physical blow. Franco, a man who joked about urinal cakes and worried about his grandson. Franco, who had looked at me with such genuine horror after he dropped the box cutter. My mind flashed back to the way his body went limp, the way the terror had returned to his eyes. He had been so confused, so remorseful. He had no idea what he had done. And now he is gone. I felt a wave of nausea, the world swaying around me.

The detective’s gaze was still on me, and he saw the shock on my face. He waited for a moment before continuing, his voice softening just a bit. ""There's something else you should know. We got a call from a neighbor yesterday. They found another one of your coworkers. Brenda.""

I went cold. The name hung in the air, heavy and silent. The little red ""unread"" icon on my phone, the unblinking eyes, it all rushed back.

""She was found in her apartment,"" the detective continued, his voice low. ""Same as Franco. She took her own life. We believe it happened around the same time.""

“Did they leave a note?” I muttered.



""No note,"" the officer said, his voice flat. ""No reason. People get scared, though. He was an old guy, a foreigner, in a strange place, locked up. Guilt, fear... it can get to a person. And you know, the body count in a place like this is a lot higher than the body count out there."" He gestured vaguely toward the street. ""Happens all the time.""

I walked to my car in a daze, the cold air doing little to clear my head. My arms throbbed beneath the bandages, but the physical pain was nothing compared to the gnawing ache in my gut. What had happened to them? What could have caused two kind, decent people to snap so violently, so completely out of character? The officer's words echoed in my mind: *Guilt, fear... it can get to a person. Happens all the time.* But that didn't feel right. It wasn't an answer. It was just a way to dismiss the horror of it all. I sat in my car, staring at the empty street, my mind a blank of confusion and sorrow. I felt completely, utterly helpless. I had no idea what was going on, or why it had happened, or what I was supposed to do now. All I knew was that two innocent people were gone.

I had just pulled into my apartment complex when my phone buzzed. It was a text from Sarah, a girl I'd been talking to for a few weeks. She was a graphic designer, witty and sarcastic, and a welcome distraction from the spiraling chaos of my life. She wanted to know if I was free to finally get that drink we'd been talking about. I hesitated, looking down at my bandaged arms. The last thing I wanted was to explain the truth. I quickly typed a reply, agreeing to meet for dinner instead, and suggested a place with a patio, so I could wear a jacket without looking suspicious.

The next weekend, I sat across from her at a small table on the patio of an Italian restaurant. The evening air was cool and filled with the scent of garlic and woodfire pizza. A gentle hum of conversation and laughter from the tables around us blended with the city noise, the distant wail of a siren, the rumble of a passing bus, the murmur of a couple walking by. The physical pain in my arms had lessened, but the ache in my heart remained.

Sarah was even more beautiful in person than in her profile picture. She had bright, intelligent eyes and a smile that seemed to light up her entire face. We fell into an easy rhythm of conversation, trading stories about our jobs, our pasts, and our hopes for the future. The weight of the last few days began to lift, replaced by a quiet, simple joy. We talked for hours, the plates of pasta between us growing cold as we laughed and shared. It felt normal. It felt good. For the first time in what felt like a long time, I wasn't thinking about Franco, or Brenda, or the terrified look in their eyes. I was just there, with Sarah, the noise of the city, a comforting blanket of sound around us.

I was laughing at something Sarah said when I saw him. A homeless man, several tables down and across the sidewalk, was weaving through the foot traffic, a crumpled cup in his hand. He was talking to people, asking for spare change, his movements a bit jerky and frantic. My eyes met his for a split second, and I quickly looked away, not wanting the awkwardness to seep into our perfect little bubble. I took a sip of my water, pretending to be engrossed in my conversation with Sarah. The city noise continued around us, a constant, comforting presence.

After a few moments, something made me look back up. The man was no longer moving. He was standing perfectly still, his crumpled cup forgotten at his side, his head tilted slightly to the right. He was staring directly at me, his eyes wide and vacant. The life and desperation that had been in them just moments ago were completely gone. The blank expression, the unblinking gaze, the doll-like stillness, it was the same look I had seen on Brenda's face, the same one I had seen on Franco's. The city noise, which had been so comforting, now felt distant, muted. A cold dread, a familiar one, filled my stomach. I gave a small, nervous smile and a nod, but the man didn't react. He just stood there, staring.

He began walking. Slowly at first, then his pace quickened. He wove through the people on the sidewalk, a single minded missile with no sense of his surroundings. His eyes never left me. Sarah, still laughing, had no idea what was happening behind her. I felt my hands ball into fists under the table, my body tensing. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat of panic. He was getting closer, his gaze unblinking, his face a mask of nothing. He reached the corner and stepped off the curb, crossing the street without looking for traffic.

A sharp blare of a horn, a screech of tires, and then a sickening thud. The homeless man was struck by a black car and tumbled to the asphalt in a broken heap. The world exploded into sound and chaos. The car's alarm wailed. People screamed. Sarah gasped and turned, her hand flying to her mouth. The driver jumped out of his car, yelling. Someone was already on the phone with 911.

The perfect date was over. We paid our bill in a stunned silence and walked away from the commotion. As we said goodbye, a block away from the scene, the pleasant evening we'd shared was overshadowed by the horror. I gave her a weak smile, a silent apology for the way the night had ended. ""I'll call you,"" she said, her voice shaky. I nodded, watching her walk away, and knew she wouldn't. The world, which had felt so normal for a few hours, had once again revealed its jagged, terrifying edges.

After that night, the world felt like a constant threat. Every time I saw someone staring, or acting strangely, my heart would leap into my throat. I stopped going to my usual coffee shop, started taking different routes to the grocery store, and even considered quitting my job, a useless thought since I was on leave. The fear was a living, breathing thing inside me, a parasite feeding on my sanity.

My mind replayed the events, searching for a pattern. Brenda's vacant stare, Franco's empty eyes as he lunged, the homeless man's unblinking gaze as he walked into traffic. The one thing they all had in common was the moment of **eye contact**. I was sure of it. It wasn't some random mental illness or a haunting; it was me. Something about me, something about looking into my eyes, was the trigger. I was the one causing this. It felt like a curse, a twisted form of a disease I was unknowingly spreading.

This new, terrifying belief made the idea of a doctor's visit a whole new level of panic. How could I go to a hospital, a place filled with sick, tired, and vulnerable people, and not make eye contact with someone? The simple act of checking in, or being in the waiting room, or even talking to a nurse felt like a death sentence. But the cuts on my arms were starting to get infected. I had to go.

I chose to go late, hoping to avoid the crowds. The hospital waiting room was eerily quiet, the sterile hum of the air conditioning the only sound. I kept my head down, my gaze fixed on my shoes, occasionally glancing at the worn out magazines on the table. The sunglasses on my face made it hard to see the text. A nurse called my name, and I followed her down a long hallway. We passed a room with its door propped open and I caught a quick glimpse of its occupant. A man, completely wrapped in a white meshy kind of material. My heart skipped a beat, and I accidentally made eye contact. His eyes were soft and unblinking, like his eyelids were stuck to his forehead. I quickly snapped my head down, the sudden motion startling the nurse. 

Once in the exam room, the doctor checked my arms and assured me that I was healing properly. He told me to come back in a couple weeks to get my stitches out. As I walked out, I had to ask, ""that man with the bandages, what happened to him?"" The doc, with a sad expression, responded, ""He was in a fire. Third degree burns over ninety percent of his body. It's a miracle he's still with us."" I thanked him and let myself out of the room, walking back the way I came.

I was doing my best to avoid looking at anyone when I heard it. A series of shouts accompanied by a wet, slapping sound. My heart seized, and I turned back. The burned man was already moving down the hall, a twisted marionette in the white mesh. His body was stiff, his movements a jerky, unnatural sprint. Tubes and wires dangled from his arms and chest, bouncing with each step. The flesh around his knees and thighs tore and bled with each stride as his stiff body struggled with the motion. I froze, my feet rooted to the floor. His vacant eyes were fixed on me, a mixture of rage and desperation on his face.

The nurses behind him were shouting, their pleas for help echoing in the empty hall, but they were too far back, their movements no match for the possessed man's impossible speed.

He got to me and lunged, his body too stiff and uncoordinated to land a punch. He missed his target, but instead, his body fell to the side and he bit down on my ribs, tearing into my shirt and peeling a large chunk of skin off my body. The pain was immediate and blinding, a hot, searing agony. I screamed, trying to push him away, but his grip was like a vice. He brought his blood soaked mouth to my ear and whispered, his voice a hateful hiss, “I know what you did.” Tears streamed from his vacant eyes as he spoke, his face a mask of utter agony. Then, he was pulled away, his body writhing and convulsing, the screams sounded like a dying animal, before he collapsed on the floor. His body went limp, his eyes fluttering before going blank. He was dead.

The doctors at the hospital were baffled. They patched up my wound, a gaping tear in my side, and gave me a regimen of antibiotics and painkillers. The police were called, but I had the hospital staff write the whole thing off as a psychotic episode from a dying patient. They had no reason to believe that I was anything but a victim of random violence. 

I went home and locked the door. I didn't answer my phone, and when the food delivery guy knocked, I just stood on the other side of the door, waiting for him to leave. My apartment became my sanctuary, the one place where I could be safe from the vengeful gaze of the world. The days bled into one another, a blur of television screens and the constant ache in my side.

I had been in my apartment for a week, and the walls had started to feel like they were closing in. To distract myself from the throbbing pain in my side and the cold fear in my gut, I turned on the TV. I flipped through the channels, finally settling on a show, a lighthearted sitcom. The familiar laughter from the show's laugh track was a comfort, a small semblance of normalcy in my isolated world.

As I watched, I felt the familiar knot of dread tighten in my stomach. The characters on the screen, a group of friends sitting in a coffee shop, began to act strangely. Their dialogue became nonsensical, their movements jerky and unnatural. Their heads slowly turned, their eyes, once full of life and laughter, now empty and vacant. Their mouths unmoving as they stared directly at me, through the screen.

I gasped, fumbling for the remote, and changed the channel. But it was the same. A documentary about nature, but the animals on screen were frozen, their eyes vacant as they stared out at me. A breaking news report, but the anchors weren't speaking, just staring, their smiles wide and unmoving.

I slammed the TV off, the silence a deafening roar. I picked up my phone, my last lifeline to the outside world. I scrolled through my social media feed, but every photo, every video, every face was empty, vacant, and staring directly at me. I screamed, throwing my phone against the wall. It shattered into a dozen pieces, the screen going black. I was alone, truly alone, and there was nowhere left to hide.

Eventually, the pain in my side started to feel better, but the fear still gnawed at me. The police weren't investigating. I couldn't go to the hospital again. I had no one to talk to. I was alone with this terrible secret. My sick leave was running out, and the landlord had sent me a notice. I had to go back to work.

The thought of going back was terrifying, but the alternative was homelessness, and I knew I couldn't survive on the streets. My savings were running on fumes. The fear was a living, breathing thing, but the need for money was a far more practical, immediate threat.

I was the first one in the office, as usual. The fluorescent lights hummed to life above me, casting a sterile, gray light over my desk. I grabbed a hot cup of eternally stale tasting coffee and settled in, the clatter of my keyboard echoing in the empty space. Another early morning, another spreadsheet. I was a human cog in a corporate machine, and I was content with that. I worked on my spreadsheets, the numbers a familiar puzzle. It felt good to be back. It felt normal. I fired away, my fingers flying across the keyboard, the numbers adding up perfectly. The mundane, predictable rhythm of the job was a welcome relief from the chaos of my life. I had been through a lot, but I was still here. I was still alive. And I was going to be okay.

The thought of Franco and Brenda danced in my mind, a brief flicker of sorrow and fear, but I pushed them away. I had to focus. I was back, I was safe, and I was going to survive this. The minutes ticked by, and I lost myself in the spreadsheets, the comforting rhythm of my fingers on the keyboard. It wasn't until the clock on my computer screen hit 11:00 a.m. that I looked up. The office was still silent. No one had shown up yet. A cold dread began to creep back into my heart.

I looked out the window and saw the edges of the glass began to blur, swirling into a distorted vortex of the wall and the outside world. I stumbled back from my desk, my heart pounding, but the room was already starting to melt. The walls swirled, the desks blended into a single, formless mass, and the fluorescent lights stretched and warped like taffy. I heard a door open somewhere down the hall, followed by slow, deliberate footsteps.

I ran, my legs clumsy and numb as the floor dissolved beneath me. I bolted for the men's bathroom, the nearest sanctuary, as the world behind me began to turn to black, a ravenous void eating up the office. I slammed the door shut and fumbled with the lock on a stall, my body trembling with a fear so profound it was almost a physical weight. The world outside the bathroom disappeared with a soft, final sigh, the sudden silence more terrifying than the chaos.

I sat on the toilet, my breath coming in ragged gasps, the world outside a dead, silent space. The bathroom itself felt solid, a small island in an ocean of nothingness. Then, I heard the bathroom door open with a gentle click. A slow, steady set of footsteps echoed in the silent room.

I clamped my hands over my mouth, trying not to make a sound, but my heart was a frantic drum, a rhythm so loud I was sure the entity could hear it. The footsteps stopped in front of my stall. The silence was absolute. My body was a ball of pure, unadulterated terror.

Then, with a sound like shattering glass, the entire room exploded. The walls, the floor, the ceiling, the sink, everything, vaporized into a storm of glittering dust. I wasn't just in the room anymore; I was floating in a vast, empty space. The bathroom and the office and everything else now just a memory. In front of me now, a breathtaking sight. A man's form, but it wasn't a man. It was the universe personified. His body wasn't made of flesh and bone, but of reality itself, a swirling kaleidoscope of stars and galaxies, nebulae and cosmic dust. It was the embodiment of anything and everything, a truly terrifying and beautiful sight. I was utterly baffled, my mind struggling to comprehend the sheer beauty of the being before me. My mouth, without my permission, opened, and one question, one thought, escaped. ""What do you want?"" I whispered, my voice a pathetic, tiny sound in the vast silence.

The being tilted its head, a galaxy spiraling in the place where its ear would be. It then reached out a hand, and I was lifted by my throat. Its fingers, made of pure light, didn't burn, didn't hurt; they simply held me, my feet dangling in the void. ""ATONEMENT,"" it replied, its voice a chorus of billions of voices, the whisper of stars and the roar of supernovas, the murmur of every human who had ever lived and died.

I was no longer in control of my own mind. Images flooded my consciousness, a terrifying, rapid fire montage of my life. My faulty spreadsheets, the doctored reports, the late night arguments with Alex. I felt the cold, hard satisfaction that had filled me when I learned that the company that we built together had blown up in his face. I was forced to relive the indifference I felt when I heard he had killed his family before killing himself. I saw the text messages he had sent me, a desperate final plea for help, a final, despairing admission that he was blaming himself. ""I don't know what I did. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry."" The Universe's disembodied voice narrated every single one, its tone a perfect blend of righteous fury and a profound, bone deep sorrow. I watched in agony as the universe exposed the truth of my carefully constructed lie.

""Why are you doing this?"" I screamed, the words a tiny, insignificant plea in the cosmic void.

""You subverted the natural order,"" the voice rumbled back, its tone a little softer now, as if explaining something simple to a simple child. ""You used the perfect machine of human intellect to kill a man's future, and I am the universe. I am the balance. I tried to reach you. I tried to make you understand. The ones you saw... they were lost souls. They were already at the end of their rope. I took them. I put them somewhere better. And I used their bodies to show you the error of your ways. I tried to correct the imbalance you created.""

I dropped to my knees, the weight of a thousand star systems pressing down on me. I tried to argue, my voice a broken whisper, ""But you caused death... Brenda... Franco...""

""Their bodies were already gone,"" the Universe replied, a gentle, sad certainty in its voice. ""They were just shells, vehicles of my will. They were suffering, and I ended that suffering. I showed you the consequences of your actions through their lives and deaths. You destroyed a man with a mind so broken, so filled with guilt and sorrow, that he lost himself completely. And you did it for nothing."" The Universe paused, the light from its body dimming a little, as if in mourning. 

The being released me, sending me tumbling to the floor that used to exist, the sensation of falling a strange comfort in the impossible reality I now inhabited. The being's form wavered, the stars and galaxies that made up its body beginning to twist and churn, a final, beautiful storm. Then, a single, perfect finger of pure starlight extended from its hand, and it pointed directly at me. I didn't feel pain. I didn't feel anything. I simply dissolved, my body, my mind, my memories, everything I had ever been, erased. I was gone, a debt collected, a wrong made right.

About me: I'm 5'5"" and curvy with dark hair. I enjoy going to concerts, and would like to meet someone who has a similar vibe. Post-punk, emo, art pop, shoegaze, and electronic music are at the core of my musical taste. I am pretty open-minded about music and try to give everything a try. I enjoy cerebral movies, but that doesn't mean I'm above watching a cheesy rom-com from time to time. Something that I really enjoy is sightseeing, whether it be checking out local spots or taking a day trip. A quick list of things I like include: coffee and tea, reading, museums, botanical gardens, going for walks, having a slow day after jamming as much as possible into one of my days off.

I have a demanding work schedule which requires a lot of flexibility from those around me. I value work-life balance, but accept that some things are out of my control, and expect that people around me are understanding of that. I can be a little intense, I'm pretty serious at first but once I warm up I enjoy joking around and being silly.

About you: I'm hoping that you are an age-appropriate gentleman who is ready to settle down. I'm not looking for instant commitment, but I would hope that the desire to have a serious relationship exists. I do my best to stay informed about world events and would hope that you do as well, being left of liberal is preferred.

1nxnfqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nxnfqk/echo/,Echo,"I was the first one in the office, as usual. The fluorescent lights hummed to life above me, casting a sterile, gray light over my desk. I grabbed a hot cup of eternally stale tasting coffee and settled in, the clatter of my keyboard echoing in the empty space. Another early morning, another spreadsheet. My mornings were filled with invoices from suppliers like ""Bob's Bolts & Widgets"" and ""Sally's Sawdust & Sundries,"" and my afternoons were a blur of double-checking expense reports and reconciling petty cash. There were no high-stakes mergers, no million dollar deals. Just a steady stream of small transactions and the comforting certainty that two plus two would always, always equal four. My biggest challenge of the week was usually trying to find the missing five cents from the last delivery order for a new shipment of widgets. I was a cog in a corporate machine, and frankly, I was content with that.

An hour later, other people started trickling in. I didn't look up until I felt a presence. I glanced over my cubicle wall and saw the single HR person we had, Brenda. She was usually a whirlwind of cheerful chaos, and today was no different. She practically sprinted over once she saw me and went for a high five, but she completely whiffed, her hand slapping nothing but air a good foot away from mine. ""Morning!"" she chirped, her voice a little too loud for nine in the morning on a Tuesday. She readjusted her stance and tried again, and this time our palms made a loud, satisfying smack. ""There we go!"" she said with a triumphant smile. ""How's my favorite numbers guy doing? You hear about the new coffee creamer? It's hazelnut! Can you believe it?""

I muttered a reply about it being a good start to the day, and she nodded vigorously, her curly red hair bouncing with the motion. After a minute or two of this one sided exchange about office supply wonders, she zipped off to her desk, leaving me to my spreadsheets and the faint smell of hazelnut.

A few moments later, I looked up from my monitor and glanced across the room near Brenda’s cubicle, just to see who her next victim was. She was standing perfectly still, her hands clasped behind her back, already staring at me. My heart gave a little jolt. It was a normal thing to look at someone, but her gaze was so intense. I quickly gave her a small smile and a nod. Brenda's face slowly twisted into a mimic of my own. She nodded back, her eyes wide and unblinking, the smile not quite reaching them. It was the sort of smile you’d see on a doll. Her gaze was fixed, unwavering. I quickly looked back down at my screen, the comforting numbers no longer feeling so certain.

A shadow fell over my monitor. I looked up, and Brenda was there, standing right next to my desk. But it wasn't Brenda. The pale face was still there, but the smile had twisted into something ugly, a sneer that showed all of her teeth. Her eyes, wide and unblinking, were fixed on me. And then she lunged. There was no warning, no scream, just the sickening crack of her hand hitting my jaw. I fell backward in my chair, scrambling to get away, but she was on me in a flash. My mug went flying, and hot coffee scalded my leg, but I barely registered the pain. All I could feel was the weight of her body on mine, the smell of hazelnut returning, and the cold, unyielding strength of her hands around my throat. The humming of the lights above me grew louder, higher, until it was the only sound in the world. I clawed at her hands, but they were unyielding, like a vise. The air left my lungs in a final, wheezing gasp, and the edges of my vision started to go gray.

Then, a shout. ""Brenda! What are you doing?"" It was Gary from marketing. I heard a thud and the scrape of a chair. Another person, Melissa the office admin, was there too. I felt a jarring tug and a brief moment of blessed relief as Brenda's hands were ripped from my throat. I gulped in air, my lungs burning. I lay there, gasping, as Gary and Melissa struggled to hold Brenda back.

Brenda wasn't fighting them, not really. She was limp, her head lolling. Her ugly sneer was gone, replaced by a look of utter bewilderment. When they finally managed to get her a few feet away, she just stood there, her hands clasped together, trembling. Her pale face was now a mask of confusion, her wide eyes darting from me, sprawled on the floor, to the two people holding her.

""Why am I...?"" she whispered, her voice small and shaky. ""What...?"" She looked at her hands, then at me. A wave of understanding seemed to wash over her. Her eyes welled up with tears. ""Oh my god... what did I do? I'm so sorry, I don't...""

Melissa was trying to figure out what had just happened, her brow furrowed in confusion, and Gary was helping me up. My neck ached and there were red welts on my throat, but I wasn't really hurt. I was just... shaken. As I stood there, leaning against my desk, watching Brenda, I couldn't bring myself to be angry. The look of genuine horror and remorse on her face was heartbreaking. It was clear she wasn't herself. I knew that if I told them what had really happened, she'd be fired, maybe even arrested. She'd lose everything.

""It's okay,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""It's a mistake. She just... slipped and fell. It was an accident.""

Everyone looked at me like I was crazy, their eyes darting from the fresh marks on my throat to the wild, panicked look on Brenda's face. Gary opened his mouth to protest, but I held his gaze, my stare daring him to contradict me. ""She tripped,"" I insisted, the words feeling foreign and clumsy on my tongue. ""Lost her balance. She reached out to grab me so she wouldn't fall, that's all. I'm fine. She's fine."" My voice was a little stronger now, a little more convincing. ""It was a total accident.""

Melissa looked from me to Brenda and back again, her expression slowly shifting from confusion to grudging acceptance. Gary, still supporting me, just shook his head slightly, but he didn't say anything. I wasn't going to be the reason her life was ruined. Not when she had no idea what she'd done. Not when she was more scared than I was.

""I'm fine,"" I repeated one last time. ""Really. It was just an accident.""

I finished filling out the incident report, lying through my teeth about the ""accident."" Melissa and Gary had shot me a few more skeptical looks, but they didn't press the issue. Brenda, tearful and still confused, had been sent home early. The rest of the day was a blur of quiet whispers and pointed glances. I tried to bury myself in my work, but the spreadsheet on my monitor might as well have been a foreign language. The burning on my throat was a constant reminder of what had happened.

Just as I was starting to feel the day might actually end, a shadow fell over my desk. I looked up and saw Franco, the building's oldest janitor. He was a small, wiry guy from somewhere in Eastern Europe, with a perpetually worried expression and a faint accent. He'd been with the company longer than anyone, and we had a weird little friendship based on mutual respect and shared early mornings.

""Ay, my friend,"" he said, his usual greeting. ""You look tired. Too much of this..."" He gestured vaguely at the computer screens around us.

I managed a weak smile. ""Just a long day, Franco. You know how it is.""

""Ah, yes. I know."" He leaned on his broom, his small frame looking weary. ""My grandson, he is doing this now. All day, in front of the screen. I tell him, 'go outside, feel the sun,' but he says the sun is not in his 'social media feeds.'"" He laughed, a dry, rattling sound. ""I don't know what this 'feeds' are, but they sound like they are making people fat.""

I chuckled. ""Tell me about it. We all need to get out more.""

""What is this?"" he asked, his voice now laced with concern, and he pointed a gnarled finger at the red marks on my throat. ""Did you fall? You have a mark like you were fighting with a cat.""

I quickly pulled my collar up, a little embarrassed by the attention. ""Oh, that?"" I said, trying for a casual tone. ""Yeah, something like that. I was helping Brenda with something earlier and she tripped. It's nothing.""

Franco didn't look convinced, but he didn't press. ""Ah, yes,"" he said, shaking his head. ""Office work. So dangerous. First, it is the paper cuts. Then, the fighting with the cats. Maybe you need to get a helmet for the office, my friend. It is a crazy place."" He laughed, a dry, rattling sound.

He nodded somberly. ""Yes. The world outside, it is still there. Even when the cubicles are not."" He gave me a quick smile, a flash of gold in his teeth, then started to move on, his janitor's cart jingling behind him.

I returned to my work, the brief distraction a welcome reprieve. But then I felt the shadow again, and a cold dread filled my stomach. I looked up, and Franco was standing there, his face unreadable. He held  one of the tools he kept on his cart. A small box cutter, its razor sharp blade extended. ""Franco?"" I asked, my voice a whisper. ""What's up?""

His eyes, usually filled with a gentle warmth, were vacant. The friendly crinkles around them were gone. Without a word, he lunged forward, the box cutter a glint of silver in his hand. I tried to pull back, but he was too fast. The first slash caught my forearm, tearing through my cream colored shirt and into my flesh. I screamed, scrambling to get away, but his hand followed, the blade carving another bloody groove in my skin. The pain was immediate and blinding. I kicked out, my chair scraping backward, trying to create distance, but he was on me, his small body an unexpected engine of violence. The blade came down again and again, leaving a burning trail of red. I screamed, a raw sound of terror and agony, as the world dissolved into a sickening mix of bright lights and sharp pain.

I fell backward in my chair, the momentum carrying me away from the slashing blade. My scream echoed through the office, a desperate, animal sound. The pain in my arms was a fire, and I saw bright red lines blossoming on my skin, blood welling up and running down my arms. I scrambled on the floor, trying to put my desk between us. Franco stood there, the box cutter dripping, His face a mix between searing hatred and utter disassociation. Gripping the desk, Franco flung his body over the table, his stained work suit a blur coming at me. His body collided with mine and we tumbled to the ground. I felt the blade find its way into my forearm as he slashed at my throat, my hand instinctually guarding my bruised neck. I grabbed his arm with my other and tried pulling the blade away. He was way stronger than his build would suggest. The force of his one arm was more than my body could fight. The blade inched closer to my neck, the tip poking the skin covering my Adams apple. I looked up at his face, his eyes almost meeting mine, but not quite. His mouth, a tight snarl, reintroducing those gold teeth. His lips moved and his mouth opened, words forming in a wheezy, deep voice; “You don’t be-” before he was pulled away by Gary and Clarence, a dark skinned man who worked in maintenance with Franco. He didn’t fight them. His body went limp and he stumbled back, his face now a mask of utter confusion. His eyes, just moments ago vacant and terrifying, were wide and filled with a frantic panic.

""Wha... no, no, no,"" he whispered, his hands trembling as he stared at the bloody blade. He looked at me, then down at my arms, and his face crumbled. ""What... what have I done?"" He dropped the box cutter, and it clattered to the floor. Other coworkers were yelling, someone was on the phone, and Gary was holding a wadded-up jacket to my arm.

The next few hours were a dizzying blur of sirens, bright lights, and the sting of antiseptic. At the hospital, doctors stitched up the cuts on my arms, wrapping them in thick bandages. My boss, a perpetually stressed man named Mr. Henderson, came to see me. He looked more concerned with liability than my well-being, but he granted me a month's medical leave, insisting I take time to rest.

I left the hospital the next day with my arms bandaged and my mind reeling. The cuts weren't too deep, but they hurt like hell, a constant throbbing reminder of the violence. The doctors prescribed some pain medication, but it did little to numb the ache in my heart. The whole thing felt like a nightmare, and for the next two days, I didn't leave my apartment. I binged old movies, ordered pizza, and tried to make sense of the look on Franco's face as he stared at the bloody box cutter, a look of pure, shocking horror.

I kept checking my phone, but Brenda hadn't replied to my Team's message. The little red ""unread"" icon sat next to her name, a persistent reminder. My inbox, however, was full of messages from concerned coworkers. *You okay, man?* Gary had asked. *I heard what happened. Seriously, are you okay?* Melissa had messaged me with a similar sentiment.

Then there were the theories. Brian from IT messaged me saying he'd heard the building used to be an old sanitarium and was haunted. Melissa sent me a link to an article about a rare mental condition that can cause people to have violent episodes they don't remember. They were crazy, but I had no better answers.

I wanted to call Brenda. To hear her happy voice, to make sure she was okay. But every time I went to dial her number, I hesitated. What would I say? ""Hey, Brenda, just checking in after your violent episode and my subsequent attack by the janitor?"" It felt ridiculous. I was considering hitting the dial button when my ringtone pierced the silence. “Hello?” I say, putting the phone to my ear. The voice on the other end was a police officer, polite but firm. He introduced himself and said he was calling about the incident at work. They needed me to come down to give a statement about the assault.

I dressed in a long sleeved shirt to hide the bandages, got in my car, and rode in silence, the city lights blurring past. The police station was sterile and smelled of old coffee, much like my office. They led me into a small, windowless room and sat me down opposite a detective with tired eyes.

I told them everything, leaving out no detail. The high-five with Brenda, the blank look in her eyes, my lie to protect her, Franco's sudden, vacant expression, his terrifying attack, the brief moment of clarity, the whispered words: ""You don't be-."" The detective listened, his expression unreadable, scribbling notes on a pad.

He asked me to repeat parts, to clarify others. He asked about my relationship with Franco. He asked about Franco’s motive. I explained our friendship, and told him Franco's actions made no sense. He seemed to find my answers insufficient, his skepticism clear in the way he looked at me, as if I were holding something back.

After what felt like an eternity, he closed his notebook and leaned forward, his voice a low rumble. ""We have to tell you something,"" he said, and my stomach dropped. ""Franco took his own life in his cell yesterday. He was found yesterday morning."" The words hit me like a physical blow. Franco, a man who joked about urinal cakes and worried about his grandson. Franco, who had looked at me with such genuine horror after he dropped the box cutter. My mind flashed back to the way his body went limp, the way the terror had returned to his eyes. He had been so confused, so remorseful. He had no idea what he had done. And now he is gone. I felt a wave of nausea, the world swaying around me.

The detective’s gaze was still on me, and he saw the shock on my face. He waited for a moment before continuing, his voice softening just a bit. ""There's something else you should know. We got a call from a neighbor yesterday. They found another one of your coworkers. Brenda.""

I went cold. The name hung in the air, heavy and silent. The little red ""unread"" icon on my phone, the unblinking eyes, it all rushed back.

""She was found in her apartment,"" the detective continued, his voice low. ""Same as Franco. She took her own life. We believe it happened around the same time.""

“Did they leave a note?” I muttered.



""No note,"" the officer said, his voice flat. ""No reason. People get scared, though. He was an old guy, a foreigner, in a strange place, locked up. Guilt, fear... it can get to a person. And you know, the body count in a place like this is a lot higher than the body count out there."" He gestured vaguely toward the street. ""Happens all the time.""

I walked to my car in a daze, the cold air doing little to clear my head. My arms throbbed beneath the bandages, but the physical pain was nothing compared to the gnawing ache in my gut. What had happened to them? What could have caused two kind, decent people to snap so violently, so completely out of character? The officer's words echoed in my mind: *Guilt, fear... it can get to a person. Happens all the time.* But that didn't feel right. It wasn't an answer. It was just a way to dismiss the horror of it all. I sat in my car, staring at the empty street, my mind a blank of confusion and sorrow. I felt completely, utterly helpless. I had no idea what was going on, or why it had happened, or what I was supposed to do now. All I knew was that two innocent people were gone.

I had just pulled into my apartment complex when my phone buzzed. It was a text from Sarah, a girl I'd been talking to for a few weeks. She was a graphic designer, witty and sarcastic, and a welcome distraction from the spiraling chaos of my life. She wanted to know if I was free to finally get that drink we'd been talking about. I hesitated, looking down at my bandaged arms. The last thing I wanted was to explain the truth. I quickly typed a reply, agreeing to meet for dinner instead, and suggested a place with a patio, so I could wear a jacket without looking suspicious.

The next weekend, I sat across from her at a small table on the patio of an Italian restaurant. The evening air was cool and filled with the scent of garlic and woodfire pizza. A gentle hum of conversation and laughter from the tables around us blended with the city noise, the distant wail of a siren, the rumble of a passing bus, the murmur of a couple walking by. The physical pain in my arms had lessened, but the ache in my heart remained.

Sarah was even more beautiful in person than in her profile picture. She had bright, intelligent eyes and a smile that seemed to light up her entire face. We fell into an easy rhythm of conversation, trading stories about our jobs, our pasts, and our hopes for the future. The weight of the last few days began to lift, replaced by a quiet, simple joy. We talked for hours, the plates of pasta between us growing cold as we laughed and shared. It felt normal. It felt good. For the first time in what felt like a long time, I wasn't thinking about Franco, or Brenda, or the terrified look in their eyes. I was just there, with Sarah, the noise of the city, a comforting blanket of sound around us.

I was laughing at something Sarah said when I saw him. A homeless man, several tables down and across the sidewalk, was weaving through the foot traffic, a crumpled cup in his hand. He was talking to people, asking for spare change, his movements a bit jerky and frantic. My eyes met his for a split second, and I quickly looked away, not wanting the awkwardness to seep into our perfect little bubble. I took a sip of my water, pretending to be engrossed in my conversation with Sarah. The city noise continued around us, a constant, comforting presence.

After a few moments, something made me look back up. The man was no longer moving. He was standing perfectly still, his crumpled cup forgotten at his side, his head tilted slightly to the right. He was staring directly at me, his eyes wide and vacant. The life and desperation that had been in them just moments ago were completely gone. The blank expression, the unblinking gaze, the doll-like stillness, it was the same look I had seen on Brenda's face, the same one I had seen on Franco's. The city noise, which had been so comforting, now felt distant, muted. A cold dread, a familiar one, filled my stomach. I gave a small, nervous smile and a nod, but the man didn't react. He just stood there, staring.

He began walking. Slowly at first, then his pace quickened. He wove through the people on the sidewalk, a single minded missile with no sense of his surroundings. His eyes never left me. Sarah, still laughing, had no idea what was happening behind her. I felt my hands ball into fists under the table, my body tensing. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat of panic. He was getting closer, his gaze unblinking, his face a mask of nothing. He reached the corner and stepped off the curb, crossing the street without looking for traffic.

A sharp blare of a horn, a screech of tires, and then a sickening thud. The homeless man was struck by a black car and tumbled to the asphalt in a broken heap. The world exploded into sound and chaos. The car's alarm wailed. People screamed. Sarah gasped and turned, her hand flying to her mouth. The driver jumped out of his car, yelling. Someone was already on the phone with 911.

The perfect date was over. We paid our bill in a stunned silence and walked away from the commotion. As we said goodbye, a block away from the scene, the pleasant evening we'd shared was overshadowed by the horror. I gave her a weak smile, a silent apology for the way the night had ended. ""I'll call you,"" she said, her voice shaky. I nodded, watching her walk away, and knew she wouldn't. The world, which had felt so normal for a few hours, had once again revealed its jagged, terrifying edges.

After that night, the world felt like a constant threat. Every time I saw someone staring, or acting strangely, my heart would leap into my throat. I stopped going to my usual coffee shop, started taking different routes to the grocery store, and even considered quitting my job, a useless thought since I was on leave. The fear was a living, breathing thing inside me, a parasite feeding on my sanity.

My mind replayed the events, searching for a pattern. Brenda's vacant stare, Franco's empty eyes as he lunged, the homeless man's unblinking gaze as he walked into traffic. The one thing they all had in common was the moment of **eye contact**. I was sure of it. It wasn't some random mental illness or a haunting; it was me. Something about me, something about looking into my eyes, was the trigger. I was the one causing this. It felt like a curse, a twisted form of a disease I was unknowingly spreading.

This new, terrifying belief made the idea of a doctor's visit a whole new level of panic. How could I go to a hospital, a place filled with sick, tired, and vulnerable people, and not make eye contact with someone? The simple act of checking in, or being in the waiting room, or even talking to a nurse felt like a death sentence. But the cuts on my arms were starting to get infected. I had to go.

I chose to go late, hoping to avoid the crowds. The hospital waiting room was eerily quiet, the sterile hum of the air conditioning the only sound. I kept my head down, my gaze fixed on my shoes, occasionally glancing at the worn out magazines on the table. The sunglasses on my face made it hard to see the text. A nurse called my name, and I followed her down a long hallway. We passed a room with its door propped open and I caught a quick glimpse of its occupant. A man, completely wrapped in a white meshy kind of material. My heart skipped a beat, and I accidentally made eye contact. His eyes were soft and unblinking, like his eyelids were stuck to his forehead. I quickly snapped my head down, the sudden motion startling the nurse. 

Once in the exam room, the doctor checked my arms and assured me that I was healing properly. He told me to come back in a couple weeks to get my stitches out. As I walked out, I had to ask, ""that man with the bandages, what happened to him?"" The doc, with a sad expression, responded, ""He was in a fire. Third degree burns over ninety percent of his body. It's a miracle he's still with us."" I thanked him and let myself out of the room, walking back the way I came.

I was doing my best to avoid looking at anyone when I heard it. A series of shouts accompanied by a wet, slapping sound. My heart seized, and I turned back. The burned man was already moving down the hall, a twisted marionette in the white mesh. His body was stiff, his movements a jerky, unnatural sprint. Tubes and wires dangled from his arms and chest, bouncing with each step. The flesh around his knees and thighs tore and bled with each stride as his stiff body struggled with the motion. I froze, my feet rooted to the floor. His vacant eyes were fixed on me, a mixture of rage and desperation on his face.

The nurses behind him were shouting, their pleas for help echoing in the empty hall, but they were too far back, their movements no match for the possessed man's impossible speed.

He got to me and lunged, his body too stiff and uncoordinated to land a punch. He missed his target, but instead, his body fell to the side and he bit down on my ribs, tearing into my shirt and peeling a large chunk of skin off my body. The pain was immediate and blinding, a hot, searing agony. I screamed, trying to push him away, but his grip was like a vice. He brought his blood soaked mouth to my ear and whispered, his voice a hateful hiss, “I know what you did.” Tears streamed from his vacant eyes as he spoke, his face a mask of utter agony. Then, he was pulled away, his body writhing and convulsing, the screams sounded like a dying animal, before he collapsed on the floor. His body went limp, his eyes fluttering before going blank. He was dead.

The doctors at the hospital were baffled. They patched up my wound, a gaping tear in my side, and gave me a regimen of antibiotics and painkillers. The police were called, but I had the hospital staff write the whole thing off as a psychotic episode from a dying patient. They had no reason to believe that I was anything but a victim of random violence. 

I went home and locked the door. I didn't answer my phone, and when the food delivery guy knocked, I just stood on the other side of the door, waiting for him to leave. My apartment became my sanctuary, the one place where I could be safe from the vengeful gaze of the world. The days bled into one another, a blur of television screens and the constant ache in my side.

I had been in my apartment for a week, and the walls had started to feel like they were closing in. To distract myself from the throbbing pain in my side and the cold fear in my gut, I turned on the TV. I flipped through the channels, finally settling on a show, a lighthearted sitcom. The familiar laughter from the show's laugh track was a comfort, a small semblance of normalcy in my isolated world.

As I watched, I felt the familiar knot of dread tighten in my stomach. The characters on the screen, a group of friends sitting in a coffee shop, began to act strangely. Their dialogue became nonsensical, their movements jerky and unnatural. Their heads slowly turned, their eyes, once full of life and laughter, now empty and vacant. Their mouths unmoving as they stared directly at me, through the screen.

I gasped, fumbling for the remote, and changed the channel. But it was the same. A documentary about nature, but the animals on screen were frozen, their eyes vacant as they stared out at me. A breaking news report, but the anchors weren't speaking, just staring, their smiles wide and unmoving.

I slammed the TV off, the silence a deafening roar. I picked up my phone, my last lifeline to the outside world. I scrolled through my social media feed, but every photo, every video, every face was empty, vacant, and staring directly at me. I screamed, throwing my phone against the wall. It shattered into a dozen pieces, the screen going black. I was alone, truly alone, and there was nowhere left to hide.

Eventually, the pain in my side started to feel better, but the fear still gnawed at me. The police weren't investigating. I couldn't go to the hospital again. I had no one to talk to. I was alone with this terrible secret. My sick leave was running out, and the landlord had sent me a notice. I had to go back to work.

The thought of going back was terrifying, but the alternative was homelessness, and I knew I couldn't survive on the streets. My savings were running on fumes. The fear was a living, breathing thing, but the need for money was a far more practical, immediate threat.

I was the first one in the office, as usual. The fluorescent lights hummed to life above me, casting a sterile, gray light over my desk. I grabbed a hot cup of eternally stale tasting coffee and settled in, the clatter of my keyboard echoing in the empty space. Another early morning, another spreadsheet. I was a human cog in a corporate machine, and I was content with that. I worked on my spreadsheets, the numbers a familiar puzzle. It felt good to be back. It felt normal. I fired away, my fingers flying across the keyboard, the numbers adding up perfectly. The mundane, predictable rhythm of the job was a welcome relief from the chaos of my life. I had been through a lot, but I was still here. I was still alive. And I was going to be okay.

The thought of Franco and Brenda danced in my mind, a brief flicker of sorrow and fear, but I pushed them away. I had to focus. I was back, I was safe, and I was going to survive this. The minutes ticked by, and I lost myself in the spreadsheets, the comforting rhythm of my fingers on the keyboard. It wasn't until the clock on my computer screen hit 11:00 a.m. that I looked up. The office was still silent. No one had shown up yet. A cold dread began to creep back into my heart.

I looked out the window and saw the edges of the glass began to blur, swirling into a distorted vortex of the wall and the outside world. I stumbled back from my desk, my heart pounding, but the room was already starting to melt. The walls swirled, the desks blended into a single, formless mass, and the fluorescent lights stretched and warped like taffy. I heard a door open somewhere down the hall, followed by slow, deliberate footsteps.

I ran, my legs clumsy and numb as the floor dissolved beneath me. I bolted for the men's bathroom, the nearest sanctuary, as the world behind me began to turn to black, a ravenous void eating up the office. I slammed the door shut and fumbled with the lock on a stall, my body trembling with a fear so profound it was almost a physical weight. The world outside the bathroom disappeared with a soft, final sigh, the sudden silence more terrifying than the chaos.

I sat on the toilet, my breath coming in ragged gasps, the world outside a dead, silent space. The bathroom itself felt solid, a small island in an ocean of nothingness. Then, I heard the bathroom door open with a gentle click. A slow, steady set of footsteps echoed in the silent room.

I clamped my hands over my mouth, trying not to make a sound, but my heart was a frantic drum, a rhythm so loud I was sure the entity could hear it. The footsteps stopped in front of my stall. The silence was absolute. My body was a ball of pure, unadulterated terror.

Then, with a sound like shattering glass, the entire room exploded. The walls, the floor, the ceiling, the sink, everything, vaporized into a storm of glittering dust. I wasn't just in the room anymore; I was floating in a vast, empty space. The bathroom and the office and everything else now just a memory. In front of me now, a breathtaking sight. A man's form, but it wasn't a man. It was the universe personified. His body wasn't made of flesh and bone, but of reality itself, a swirling kaleidoscope of stars and galaxies, nebulae and cosmic dust. It was the embodiment of anything and everything, a truly terrifying and beautiful sight. I was utterly baffled, my mind struggling to comprehend the sheer beauty of the being before me. My mouth, without my permission, opened, and one question, one thought, escaped. ""What do you want?"" I whispered, my voice a pathetic, tiny sound in the vast silence.

The being tilted its head, a galaxy spiraling in the place where its ear would be. It then reached out a hand, and I was lifted by my throat. Its fingers, made of pure light, didn't burn, didn't hurt; they simply held me, my feet dangling in the void. ""ATONEMENT,"" it replied, its voice a chorus of billions of voices, the whisper of stars and the roar of supernovas, the murmur of every human who had ever lived and died.

I was no longer in control of my own mind. Images flooded my consciousness, a terrifying, rapid fire montage of my life. My faulty spreadsheets, the doctored reports, the late night arguments with Alex. I felt the cold, hard satisfaction that had filled me when I learned that the company that we built together had blown up in his face. I was forced to relive the indifference I felt when I heard he had killed his family before killing himself. I saw the text messages he had sent me, a desperate final plea for help, a final, despairing admission that he was blaming himself. ""I don't know what I did. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry."" The Universe's disembodied voice narrated every single one, its tone a perfect blend of righteous fury and a profound, bone deep sorrow. I watched in agony as the universe exposed the truth of my carefully constructed lie.

""Why are you doing this?"" I screamed, the words a tiny, insignificant plea in the cosmic void.

""You subverted the natural order,"" the voice rumbled back, its tone a little softer now, as if explaining something simple to a simple child. ""You used the perfect machine of human intellect to kill a man's future, and I am the universe. I am the balance. I tried to reach you. I tried to make you understand. The ones you saw... they were lost souls. They were already at the end of their rope. I took them. I put them somewhere better. And I used their bodies to show you the error of your ways. I tried to correct the imbalance you created.""

I dropped to my knees, the weight of a thousand star systems pressing down on me. I tried to argue, my voice a broken whisper, ""But you caused death... Brenda... Franco...""

""Their bodies were already gone,"" the Universe replied, a gentle, sad certainty in its voice. ""They were just shells, vehicles of my will. They were suffering, and I ended that suffering. I showed you the consequences of your actions through their lives and deaths. You destroyed a man with a mind so broken, so filled with guilt and sorrow, that he lost himself completely. And you did it for nothing."" The Universe paused, the light from its body dimming a little, as if in mourning. 

The being released me, sending me tumbling to the floor that used to exist, the sensation of falling a strange comfort in the impossible reality I now inhabited. The being's form wavered, the stars and galaxies that made up its body beginning to twist and churn, a final, beautiful storm. Then, a single, perfect finger of pure starlight extended from its hand, and it pointed directly at me. I didn't feel pain. I didn't feel anything. I simply dissolved, my body, my mind, my memories, everything I had ever been, erased. I was gone, a debt collected, a wrong made right.

1nxnedp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1nxnedp/echo/,Echo,"I was the first one in the office, as usual. The fluorescent lights hummed to life above me, casting a sterile, gray light over my desk. I grabbed a hot cup of eternally stale tasting coffee and settled in, the clatter of my keyboard echoing in the empty space. Another early morning, another spreadsheet. My mornings were filled with invoices from suppliers like ""Bob's Bolts & Widgets"" and ""Sally's Sawdust & Sundries,"" and my afternoons were a blur of double-checking expense reports and reconciling petty cash. There were no high-stakes mergers, no million dollar deals. Just a steady stream of small transactions and the comforting certainty that two plus two would always, always equal four. My biggest challenge of the week was usually trying to find the missing five cents from the last delivery order for a new shipment of widgets. I was a cog in a corporate machine, and frankly, I was content with that.

An hour later, other people started trickling in. I didn't look up until I felt a presence. I glanced over my cubicle wall and saw the single HR person we had, Brenda. She was usually a whirlwind of cheerful chaos, and today was no different. She practically sprinted over once she saw me and went for a high five, but she completely whiffed, her hand slapping nothing but air a good foot away from mine. ""Morning!"" she chirped, her voice a little too loud for nine in the morning on a Tuesday. She readjusted her stance and tried again, and this time our palms made a loud, satisfying smack. ""There we go!"" she said with a triumphant smile. ""How's my favorite numbers guy doing? You hear about the new coffee creamer? It's hazelnut! Can you believe it?""

I muttered a reply about it being a good start to the day, and she nodded vigorously, her curly red hair bouncing with the motion. After a minute or two of this one sided exchange about office supply wonders, she zipped off to her desk, leaving me to my spreadsheets and the faint smell of hazelnut.

A few moments later, I looked up from my monitor and glanced across the room near Brenda’s cubicle, just to see who her next victim was. She was standing perfectly still, her hands clasped behind her back, already staring at me. My heart gave a little jolt. It was a normal thing to look at someone, but her gaze was so intense. I quickly gave her a small smile and a nod. Brenda's face slowly twisted into a mimic of my own. She nodded back, her eyes wide and unblinking, the smile not quite reaching them. It was the sort of smile you’d see on a doll. Her gaze was fixed, unwavering. I quickly looked back down at my screen, the comforting numbers no longer feeling so certain.

A shadow fell over my monitor. I looked up, and Brenda was there, standing right next to my desk. But it wasn't Brenda. The pale face was still there, but the smile had twisted into something ugly, a sneer that showed all of her teeth. Her eyes, wide and unblinking, were fixed on me. And then she lunged. There was no warning, no scream, just the sickening crack of her hand hitting my jaw. I fell backward in my chair, scrambling to get away, but she was on me in a flash. My mug went flying, and hot coffee scalded my leg, but I barely registered the pain. All I could feel was the weight of her body on mine, the smell of hazelnut returning, and the cold, unyielding strength of her hands around my throat. The humming of the lights above me grew louder, higher, until it was the only sound in the world. I clawed at her hands, but they were unyielding, like a vise. The air left my lungs in a final, wheezing gasp, and the edges of my vision started to go gray.

Then, a shout. ""Brenda! What are you doing?"" It was Gary from marketing. I heard a thud and the scrape of a chair. Another person, Melissa the office admin, was there too. I felt a jarring tug and a brief moment of blessed relief as Brenda's hands were ripped from my throat. I gulped in air, my lungs burning. I lay there, gasping, as Gary and Melissa struggled to hold Brenda back.

Brenda wasn't fighting them, not really. She was limp, her head lolling. Her ugly sneer was gone, replaced by a look of utter bewilderment. When they finally managed to get her a few feet away, she just stood there, her hands clasped together, trembling. Her pale face was now a mask of confusion, her wide eyes darting from me, sprawled on the floor, to the two people holding her.

""Why am I...?"" she whispered, her voice small and shaky. ""What...?"" She looked at her hands, then at me. A wave of understanding seemed to wash over her. Her eyes welled up with tears. ""Oh my god... what did I do? I'm so sorry, I don't...""

Melissa was trying to figure out what had just happened, her brow furrowed in confusion, and Gary was helping me up. My neck ached and there were red welts on my throat, but I wasn't really hurt. I was just... shaken. As I stood there, leaning against my desk, watching Brenda, I couldn't bring myself to be angry. The look of genuine horror and remorse on her face was heartbreaking. It was clear she wasn't herself. I knew that if I told them what had really happened, she'd be fired, maybe even arrested. She'd lose everything.

""It's okay,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""It's a mistake. She just... slipped and fell. It was an accident.""

Everyone looked at me like I was crazy, their eyes darting from the fresh marks on my throat to the wild, panicked look on Brenda's face. Gary opened his mouth to protest, but I held his gaze, my stare daring him to contradict me. ""She tripped,"" I insisted, the words feeling foreign and clumsy on my tongue. ""Lost her balance. She reached out to grab me so she wouldn't fall, that's all. I'm fine. She's fine."" My voice was a little stronger now, a little more convincing. ""It was a total accident.""

Melissa looked from me to Brenda and back again, her expression slowly shifting from confusion to grudging acceptance. Gary, still supporting me, just shook his head slightly, but he didn't say anything. I wasn't going to be the reason her life was ruined. Not when she had no idea what she'd done. Not when she was more scared than I was.

""I'm fine,"" I repeated one last time. ""Really. It was just an accident.""

I finished filling out the incident report, lying through my teeth about the ""accident."" Melissa and Gary had shot me a few more skeptical looks, but they didn't press the issue. Brenda, tearful and still confused, had been sent home early. The rest of the day was a blur of quiet whispers and pointed glances. I tried to bury myself in my work, but the spreadsheet on my monitor might as well have been a foreign language. The burning on my throat was a constant reminder of what had happened.

Just as I was starting to feel the day might actually end, a shadow fell over my desk. I looked up and saw Franco, the building's oldest janitor. He was a small, wiry guy from somewhere in Eastern Europe, with a perpetually worried expression and a faint accent. He'd been with the company longer than anyone, and we had a weird little friendship based on mutual respect and shared early mornings.

""Ay, my friend,"" he said, his usual greeting. ""You look tired. Too much of this..."" He gestured vaguely at the computer screens around us.

I managed a weak smile. ""Just a long day, Franco. You know how it is.""

""Ah, yes. I know."" He leaned on his broom, his small frame looking weary. ""My grandson, he is doing this now. All day, in front of the screen. I tell him, 'go outside, feel the sun,' but he says the sun is not in his 'social media feeds.'"" He laughed, a dry, rattling sound. ""I don't know what this 'feeds' are, but they sound like they are making people fat.""

I chuckled. ""Tell me about it. We all need to get out more.""

""What is this?"" he asked, his voice now laced with concern, and he pointed a gnarled finger at the red marks on my throat. ""Did you fall? You have a mark like you were fighting with a cat.""

I quickly pulled my collar up, a little embarrassed by the attention. ""Oh, that?"" I said, trying for a casual tone. ""Yeah, something like that. I was helping Brenda with something earlier and she tripped. It's nothing.""

Franco didn't look convinced, but he didn't press. ""Ah, yes,"" he said, shaking his head. ""Office work. So dangerous. First, it is the paper cuts. Then, the fighting with the cats. Maybe you need to get a helmet for the office, my friend. It is a crazy place."" He laughed, a dry, rattling sound.

He nodded somberly. ""Yes. The world outside, it is still there. Even when the cubicles are not."" He gave me a quick smile, a flash of gold in his teeth, then started to move on, his janitor's cart jingling behind him.

I returned to my work, the brief distraction a welcome reprieve. But then I felt the shadow again, and a cold dread filled my stomach. I looked up, and Franco was standing there, his face unreadable. He held  one of the tools he kept on his cart. A small box cutter, its razor sharp blade extended. ""Franco?"" I asked, my voice a whisper. ""What's up?""

His eyes, usually filled with a gentle warmth, were vacant. The friendly crinkles around them were gone. Without a word, he lunged forward, the box cutter a glint of silver in his hand. I tried to pull back, but he was too fast. The first slash caught my forearm, tearing through my cream colored shirt and into my flesh. I screamed, scrambling to get away, but his hand followed, the blade carving another bloody groove in my skin. The pain was immediate and blinding. I kicked out, my chair scraping backward, trying to create distance, but he was on me, his small body an unexpected engine of violence. The blade came down again and again, leaving a burning trail of red. I screamed, a raw sound of terror and agony, as the world dissolved into a sickening mix of bright lights and sharp pain.

I fell backward in my chair, the momentum carrying me away from the slashing blade. My scream echoed through the office, a desperate, animal sound. The pain in my arms was a fire, and I saw bright red lines blossoming on my skin, blood welling up and running down my arms. I scrambled on the floor, trying to put my desk between us. Franco stood there, the box cutter dripping, His face a mix between searing hatred and utter disassociation. Gripping the desk, Franco flung his body over the table, his stained work suit a blur coming at me. His body collided with mine and we tumbled to the ground. I felt the blade find its way into my forearm as he slashed at my throat, my hand instinctually guarding my bruised neck. I grabbed his arm with my other and tried pulling the blade away. He was way stronger than his build would suggest. The force of his one arm was more than my body could fight. The blade inched closer to my neck, the tip poking the skin covering my Adams apple. I looked up at his face, his eyes almost meeting mine, but not quite. His mouth, a tight snarl, reintroducing those gold teeth. His lips moved and his mouth opened, words forming in a wheezy, deep voice; “You don’t be-” before he was pulled away by Gary and Clarence, a dark skinned man who worked in maintenance with Franco. He didn’t fight them. His body went limp and he stumbled back, his face now a mask of utter confusion. His eyes, just moments ago vacant and terrifying, were wide and filled with a frantic panic.

""Wha... no, no, no,"" he whispered, his hands trembling as he stared at the bloody blade. He looked at me, then down at my arms, and his face crumbled. ""What... what have I done?"" He dropped the box cutter, and it clattered to the floor. Other coworkers were yelling, someone was on the phone, and Gary was holding a wadded-up jacket to my arm.

The next few hours were a dizzying blur of sirens, bright lights, and the sting of antiseptic. At the hospital, doctors stitched up the cuts on my arms, wrapping them in thick bandages. My boss, a perpetually stressed man named Mr. Henderson, came to see me. He looked more concerned with liability than my well-being, but he granted me a month's medical leave, insisting I take time to rest.

I left the hospital the next day with my arms bandaged and my mind reeling. The cuts weren't too deep, but they hurt like hell, a constant throbbing reminder of the violence. The doctors prescribed some pain medication, but it did little to numb the ache in my heart. The whole thing felt like a nightmare, and for the next two days, I didn't leave my apartment. I binged old movies, ordered pizza, and tried to make sense of the look on Franco's face as he stared at the bloody box cutter, a look of pure, shocking horror.

I kept checking my phone, but Brenda hadn't replied to my Team's message. The little red ""unread"" icon sat next to her name, a persistent reminder. My inbox, however, was full of messages from concerned coworkers. *You okay, man?* Gary had asked. *I heard what happened. Seriously, are you okay?* Melissa had messaged me with a similar sentiment.

Then there were the theories. Brian from IT messaged me saying he'd heard the building used to be an old sanitarium and was haunted. Melissa sent me a link to an article about a rare mental condition that can cause people to have violent episodes they don't remember. They were crazy, but I had no better answers.

I wanted to call Brenda. To hear her happy voice, to make sure she was okay. But every time I went to dial her number, I hesitated. What would I say? ""Hey, Brenda, just checking in after your violent episode and my subsequent attack by the janitor?"" It felt ridiculous. I was considering hitting the dial button when my ringtone pierced the silence. “Hello?” I say, putting the phone to my ear. The voice on the other end was a police officer, polite but firm. He introduced himself and said he was calling about the incident at work. They needed me to come down to give a statement about the assault.

I dressed in a long sleeved shirt to hide the bandages, got in my car, and rode in silence, the city lights blurring past. The police station was sterile and smelled of old coffee, much like my office. They led me into a small, windowless room and sat me down opposite a detective with tired eyes.

I told them everything, leaving out no detail. The high-five with Brenda, the blank look in her eyes, my lie to protect her, Franco's sudden, vacant expression, his terrifying attack, the brief moment of clarity, the whispered words: ""You don't be-."" The detective listened, his expression unreadable, scribbling notes on a pad.

He asked me to repeat parts, to clarify others. He asked about my relationship with Franco. He asked about Franco’s motive. I explained our friendship, and told him Franco's actions made no sense. He seemed to find my answers insufficient, his skepticism clear in the way he looked at me, as if I were holding something back.

After what felt like an eternity, he closed his notebook and leaned forward, his voice a low rumble. ""We have to tell you something,"" he said, and my stomach dropped. ""Franco took his own life in his cell yesterday. He was found yesterday morning."" The words hit me like a physical blow. Franco, a man who joked about urinal cakes and worried about his grandson. Franco, who had looked at me with such genuine horror after he dropped the box cutter. My mind flashed back to the way his body went limp, the way the terror had returned to his eyes. He had been so confused, so remorseful. He had no idea what he had done. And now he is gone. I felt a wave of nausea, the world swaying around me.

The detective’s gaze was still on me, and he saw the shock on my face. He waited for a moment before continuing, his voice softening just a bit. ""There's something else you should know. We got a call from a neighbor yesterday. They found another one of your coworkers. Brenda.""

I went cold. The name hung in the air, heavy and silent. The little red ""unread"" icon on my phone, the unblinking eyes, it all rushed back.

""She was found in her apartment,"" the detective continued, his voice low. ""Same as Franco. She took her own life. We believe it happened around the same time.""

“Did they leave a note?” I muttered.



""No note,"" the officer said, his voice flat. ""No reason. People get scared, though. He was an old guy, a foreigner, in a strange place, locked up. Guilt, fear... it can get to a person. And you know, the body count in a place like this is a lot higher than the body count out there."" He gestured vaguely toward the street. ""Happens all the time.""

I walked to my car in a daze, the cold air doing little to clear my head. My arms throbbed beneath the bandages, but the physical pain was nothing compared to the gnawing ache in my gut. What had happened to them? What could have caused two kind, decent people to snap so violently, so completely out of character? The officer's words echoed in my mind: *Guilt, fear... it can get to a person. Happens all the time.* But that didn't feel right. It wasn't an answer. It was just a way to dismiss the horror of it all. I sat in my car, staring at the empty street, my mind a blank of confusion and sorrow. I felt completely, utterly helpless. I had no idea what was going on, or why it had happened, or what I was supposed to do now. All I knew was that two innocent people were gone.

I had just pulled into my apartment complex when my phone buzzed. It was a text from Sarah, a girl I'd been talking to for a few weeks. She was a graphic designer, witty and sarcastic, and a welcome distraction from the spiraling chaos of my life. She wanted to know if I was free to finally get that drink we'd been talking about. I hesitated, looking down at my bandaged arms. The last thing I wanted was to explain the truth. I quickly typed a reply, agreeing to meet for dinner instead, and suggested a place with a patio, so I could wear a jacket without looking suspicious.

The next weekend, I sat across from her at a small table on the patio of an Italian restaurant. The evening air was cool and filled with the scent of garlic and woodfire pizza. A gentle hum of conversation and laughter from the tables around us blended with the city noise, the distant wail of a siren, the rumble of a passing bus, the murmur of a couple walking by. The physical pain in my arms had lessened, but the ache in my heart remained.

Sarah was even more beautiful in person than in her profile picture. She had bright, intelligent eyes and a smile that seemed to light up her entire face. We fell into an easy rhythm of conversation, trading stories about our jobs, our pasts, and our hopes for the future. The weight of the last few days began to lift, replaced by a quiet, simple joy. We talked for hours, the plates of pasta between us growing cold as we laughed and shared. It felt normal. It felt good. For the first time in what felt like a long time, I wasn't thinking about Franco, or Brenda, or the terrified look in their eyes. I was just there, with Sarah, the noise of the city, a comforting blanket of sound around us.

I was laughing at something Sarah said when I saw him. A homeless man, several tables down and across the sidewalk, was weaving through the foot traffic, a crumpled cup in his hand. He was talking to people, asking for spare change, his movements a bit jerky and frantic. My eyes met his for a split second, and I quickly looked away, not wanting the awkwardness to seep into our perfect little bubble. I took a sip of my water, pretending to be engrossed in my conversation with Sarah. The city noise continued around us, a constant, comforting presence.

After a few moments, something made me look back up. The man was no longer moving. He was standing perfectly still, his crumpled cup forgotten at his side, his head tilted slightly to the right. He was staring directly at me, his eyes wide and vacant. The life and desperation that had been in them just moments ago were completely gone. The blank expression, the unblinking gaze, the doll-like stillness, it was the same look I had seen on Brenda's face, the same one I had seen on Franco's. The city noise, which had been so comforting, now felt distant, muted. A cold dread, a familiar one, filled my stomach. I gave a small, nervous smile and a nod, but the man didn't react. He just stood there, staring.

He began walking. Slowly at first, then his pace quickened. He wove through the people on the sidewalk, a single minded missile with no sense of his surroundings. His eyes never left me. Sarah, still laughing, had no idea what was happening behind her. I felt my hands ball into fists under the table, my body tensing. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat of panic. He was getting closer, his gaze unblinking, his face a mask of nothing. He reached the corner and stepped off the curb, crossing the street without looking for traffic.

A sharp blare of a horn, a screech of tires, and then a sickening thud. The homeless man was struck by a black car and tumbled to the asphalt in a broken heap. The world exploded into sound and chaos. The car's alarm wailed. People screamed. Sarah gasped and turned, her hand flying to her mouth. The driver jumped out of his car, yelling. Someone was already on the phone with 911.

The perfect date was over. We paid our bill in a stunned silence and walked away from the commotion. As we said goodbye, a block away from the scene, the pleasant evening we'd shared was overshadowed by the horror. I gave her a weak smile, a silent apology for the way the night had ended. ""I'll call you,"" she said, her voice shaky. I nodded, watching her walk away, and knew she wouldn't. The world, which had felt so normal for a few hours, had once again revealed its jagged, terrifying edges.

After that night, the world felt like a constant threat. Every time I saw someone staring, or acting strangely, my heart would leap into my throat. I stopped going to my usual coffee shop, started taking different routes to the grocery store, and even considered quitting my job, a useless thought since I was on leave. The fear was a living, breathing thing inside me, a parasite feeding on my sanity.

My mind replayed the events, searching for a pattern. Brenda's vacant stare, Franco's empty eyes as he lunged, the homeless man's unblinking gaze as he walked into traffic. The one thing they all had in common was the moment of **eye contact**. I was sure of it. It wasn't some random mental illness or a haunting; it was me. Something about me, something about looking into my eyes, was the trigger. I was the one causing this. It felt like a curse, a twisted form of a disease I was unknowingly spreading.

This new, terrifying belief made the idea of a doctor's visit a whole new level of panic. How could I go to a hospital, a place filled with sick, tired, and vulnerable people, and not make eye contact with someone? The simple act of checking in, or being in the waiting room, or even talking to a nurse felt like a death sentence. But the cuts on my arms were starting to get infected. I had to go.

I chose to go late, hoping to avoid the crowds. The hospital waiting room was eerily quiet, the sterile hum of the air conditioning the only sound. I kept my head down, my gaze fixed on my shoes, occasionally glancing at the worn out magazines on the table. The sunglasses on my face made it hard to see the text. A nurse called my name, and I followed her down a long hallway. We passed a room with its door propped open and I caught a quick glimpse of its occupant. A man, completely wrapped in a white meshy kind of material. My heart skipped a beat, and I accidentally made eye contact. His eyes were soft and unblinking, like his eyelids were stuck to his forehead. I quickly snapped my head down, the sudden motion startling the nurse. 

Once in the exam room, the doctor checked my arms and assured me that I was healing properly. He told me to come back in a couple weeks to get my stitches out. As I walked out, I had to ask, ""that man with the bandages, what happened to him?"" The doc, with a sad expression, responded, ""He was in a fire. Third degree burns over ninety percent of his body. It's a miracle he's still with us."" I thanked him and let myself out of the room, walking back the way I came.

I was doing my best to avoid looking at anyone when I heard it. A series of shouts accompanied by a wet, slapping sound. My heart seized, and I turned back. The burned man was already moving down the hall, a twisted marionette in the white mesh. His body was stiff, his movements a jerky, unnatural sprint. Tubes and wires dangled from his arms and chest, bouncing with each step. The flesh around his knees and thighs tore and bled with each stride as his stiff body struggled with the motion. I froze, my feet rooted to the floor. His vacant eyes were fixed on me, a mixture of rage and desperation on his face.

The nurses behind him were shouting, their pleas for help echoing in the empty hall, but they were too far back, their movements no match for the possessed man's impossible speed.

He got to me and lunged, his body too stiff and uncoordinated to land a punch. He missed his target, but instead, his body fell to the side and he bit down on my ribs, tearing into my shirt and peeling a large chunk of skin off my body. The pain was immediate and blinding, a hot, searing agony. I screamed, trying to push him away, but his grip was like a vice. He brought his blood soaked mouth to my ear and whispered, his voice a hateful hiss, “I know what you did.” Tears streamed from his vacant eyes as he spoke, his face a mask of utter agony. Then, he was pulled away, his body writhing and convulsing, the screams sounded like a dying animal, before he collapsed on the floor. His body went limp, his eyes fluttering before going blank. He was dead.

The doctors at the hospital were baffled. They patched up my wound, a gaping tear in my side, and gave me a regimen of antibiotics and painkillers. The police were called, but I had the hospital staff write the whole thing off as a psychotic episode from a dying patient. They had no reason to believe that I was anything but a victim of random violence. 

I went home and locked the door. I didn't answer my phone, and when the food delivery guy knocked, I just stood on the other side of the door, waiting for him to leave. My apartment became my sanctuary, the one place where I could be safe from the vengeful gaze of the world. The days bled into one another, a blur of television screens and the constant ache in my side.

I had been in my apartment for a week, and the walls had started to feel like they were closing in. To distract myself from the throbbing pain in my side and the cold fear in my gut, I turned on the TV. I flipped through the channels, finally settling on a show, a lighthearted sitcom. The familiar laughter from the show's laugh track was a comfort, a small semblance of normalcy in my isolated world.

As I watched, I felt the familiar knot of dread tighten in my stomach. The characters on the screen, a group of friends sitting in a coffee shop, began to act strangely. Their dialogue became nonsensical, their movements jerky and unnatural. Their heads slowly turned, their eyes, once full of life and laughter, now empty and vacant. Their mouths unmoving as they stared directly at me, through the screen.

I gasped, fumbling for the remote, and changed the channel. But it was the same. A documentary about nature, but the animals on screen were frozen, their eyes vacant as they stared out at me. A breaking news report, but the anchors weren't speaking, just staring, their smiles wide and unmoving.

I slammed the TV off, the silence a deafening roar. I picked up my phone, my last lifeline to the outside world. I scrolled through my social media feed, but every photo, every video, every face was empty, vacant, and staring directly at me. I screamed, throwing my phone against the wall. It shattered into a dozen pieces, the screen going black. I was alone, truly alone, and there was nowhere left to hide.

Eventually, the pain in my side started to feel better, but the fear still gnawed at me. The police weren't investigating. I couldn't go to the hospital again. I had no one to talk to. I was alone with this terrible secret. My sick leave was running out, and the landlord had sent me a notice. I had to go back to work.

The thought of going back was terrifying, but the alternative was homelessness, and I knew I couldn't survive on the streets. My savings were running on fumes. The fear was a living, breathing thing, but the need for money was a far more practical, immediate threat.

I was the first one in the office, as usual. The fluorescent lights hummed to life above me, casting a sterile, gray light over my desk. I grabbed a hot cup of eternally stale tasting coffee and settled in, the clatter of my keyboard echoing in the empty space. Another early morning, another spreadsheet. I was a human cog in a corporate machine, and I was content with that. I worked on my spreadsheets, the numbers a familiar puzzle. It felt good to be back. It felt normal. I fired away, my fingers flying across the keyboard, the numbers adding up perfectly. The mundane, predictable rhythm of the job was a welcome relief from the chaos of my life. I had been through a lot, but I was still here. I was still alive. And I was going to be okay.

The thought of Franco and Brenda danced in my mind, a brief flicker of sorrow and fear, but I pushed them away. I had to focus. I was back, I was safe, and I was going to survive this. The minutes ticked by, and I lost myself in the spreadsheets, the comforting rhythm of my fingers on the keyboard. It wasn't until the clock on my computer screen hit 11:00 a.m. that I looked up. The office was still silent. No one had shown up yet. A cold dread began to creep back into my heart.

I looked out the window and saw the edges of the glass began to blur, swirling into a distorted vortex of the wall and the outside world. I stumbled back from my desk, my heart pounding, but the room was already starting to melt. The walls swirled, the desks blended into a single, formless mass, and the fluorescent lights stretched and warped like taffy. I heard a door open somewhere down the hall, followed by slow, deliberate footsteps.

I ran, my legs clumsy and numb as the floor dissolved beneath me. I bolted for the men's bathroom, the nearest sanctuary, as the world behind me began to turn to black, a ravenous void eating up the office. I slammed the door shut and fumbled with the lock on a stall, my body trembling with a fear so profound it was almost a physical weight. The world outside the bathroom disappeared with a soft, final sigh, the sudden silence more terrifying than the chaos.

I sat on the toilet, my breath coming in ragged gasps, the world outside a dead, silent space. The bathroom itself felt solid, a small island in an ocean of nothingness. Then, I heard the bathroom door open with a gentle click. A slow, steady set of footsteps echoed in the silent room.

I clamped my hands over my mouth, trying not to make a sound, but my heart was a frantic drum, a rhythm so loud I was sure the entity could hear it. The footsteps stopped in front of my stall. The silence was absolute. My body was a ball of pure, unadulterated terror.

Then, with a sound like shattering glass, the entire room exploded. The walls, the floor, the ceiling, the sink, everything, vaporized into a storm of glittering dust. I wasn't just in the room anymore; I was floating in a vast, empty space. The bathroom and the office and everything else now just a memory. In front of me now, a breathtaking sight. A man's form, but it wasn't a man. It was the universe personified. His body wasn't made of flesh and bone, but of reality itself, a swirling kaleidoscope of stars and galaxies, nebulae and cosmic dust. It was the embodiment of anything and everything, a truly terrifying and beautiful sight. I was utterly baffled, my mind struggling to comprehend the sheer beauty of the being before me. My mouth, without my permission, opened, and one question, one thought, escaped. ""What do you want?"" I whispered, my voice a pathetic, tiny sound in the vast silence.

The being tilted its head, a galaxy spiraling in the place where its ear would be. It then reached out a hand, and I was lifted by my throat. Its fingers, made of pure light, didn't burn, didn't hurt; they simply held me, my feet dangling in the void. ""ATONEMENT,"" it replied, its voice a chorus of billions of voices, the whisper of stars and the roar of supernovas, the murmur of every human who had ever lived and died.

I was no longer in control of my own mind. Images flooded my consciousness, a terrifying, rapid fire montage of my life. My faulty spreadsheets, the doctored reports, the late night arguments with Alex. I felt the cold, hard satisfaction that had filled me when I learned that the company that we built together had blown up in his face. I was forced to relive the indifference I felt when I heard he had killed his family before killing himself. I saw the text messages he had sent me, a desperate final plea for help, a final, despairing admission that he was blaming himself. ""I don't know what I did. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry."" The Universe's disembodied voice narrated every single one, its tone a perfect blend of righteous fury and a profound, bone deep sorrow. I watched in agony as the universe exposed the truth of my carefully constructed lie.

""Why are you doing this?"" I screamed, the words a tiny, insignificant plea in the cosmic void.

""You subverted the natural order,"" the voice rumbled back, its tone a little softer now, as if explaining something simple to a simple child. ""You used the perfect machine of human intellect to kill a man's future, and I am the universe. I am the balance. I tried to reach you. I tried to make you understand. The ones you saw... they were lost souls. They were already at the end of their rope. I took them. I put them somewhere better. And I used their bodies to show you the error of your ways. I tried to correct the imbalance you created.""

I dropped to my knees, the weight of a thousand star systems pressing down on me. I tried to argue, my voice a broken whisper, ""But you caused death... Brenda... Franco...""

""Their bodies were already gone,"" the Universe replied, a gentle, sad certainty in its voice. ""They were just shells, vehicles of my will. They were suffering, and I ended that suffering. I showed you the consequences of your actions through their lives and deaths. You destroyed a man with a mind so broken, so filled with guilt and sorrow, that he lost himself completely. And you did it for nothing."" The Universe paused, the light from its body dimming a little, as if in mourning. 

The being released me, sending me tumbling to the floor that used to exist, the sensation of falling a strange comfort in the impossible reality I now inhabited. The being's form wavered, the stars and galaxies that made up its body beginning to twist and churn, a final, beautiful storm. Then, a single, perfect finger of pure starlight extended from its hand, and it pointed directly at me. I didn't feel pain. I didn't feel anything. I simply dissolved, my body, my mind, my memories, everything I had ever been, erased. I was gone, a debt collected, a wrong made right.

1nxncy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nxncy6/aio_my_boyfriends_bestfriend_male_is_getting_too/,AIO: my boyfriend’s bestfriend (male) is getting too comfortable,"I (23f) and my boyfriend (22) are kind of living together. I have an apartment 3 minutes away from our uni and obviously he’s here most of the time, since his parents’ house is 45mins away. Anyway, that means that most of our uni friends come over, sometimes sleep over and that’s fine, but the sleepovers are mostly my girlfriends who sleep on the couch in the living room, while we sleep in the bedroom. Well, that happens too with his male bestfriend from our uni. He’s a nice, funny, good looking, respectful, like just a normal guy. I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 2 and a half years, so yes, I got close with his bestfriend, but in the sense that I like to hang out with him and I guess he’s my friend too. So what’s happening is that he comes over a lot. Yes, he lives really far away from our uni, so I understand. At first, he would ask to sleep here only if my boyfriend is also sleeping here, but now it doesn’t matter anymore. My boyfriend would go to his parents’ house for the weekend and the best friend is still here. 

Here are the red flags. When we started hanging out more (about a year ago), he would say things like “when I saw you for the first time I thought you’re one of the prettiest girls I’ve ever seen”, comparing me to my at the time girlfriend and how I’m so much more attractive than her. But, I don’t know how to explain it, he does not say it in a weird creepy way. 
Then the sleepovers. Even if my boyfriend isn’t here, I sleep in the bedroom, he sleeps on the couch. But almost every time he would wake me up for coffee, wearing only underwear. And it still isn’t like weird in the moment, he doesn’t make it weird, but I don’t know. 
Also, he’s really touchy, like hugging for example. 
ALSO, he tells everyone that I’m his female bestfriend. I mean, I get it, we spend a lot of time together and talk about everything, but I’m sure that if I broke up with my boyfriend I would never hangout with the bestfriend again. Right?? 

I brought this up to my boyfriend, he says that it is weird if I feel weird. He says that the bestfriend is fresh out of the highschool 5 year relationship, he’s confused, he has multiple questionable friendgroups and the uni and that we are safe for him. He says that if I feel uncomfortable, he is going to talk to him, but I just feel weird about that too. I mean what if that ruins their friendship? 

I’m really confused about the female and male relationship in general. I’m confused because sometimes I feel like a have two boyfriends, they both make me coffee in the morning, both buy me groceries, they both are on and off living here. And I am NOT poly, nor is my boyfriend. I’m really questioning if the bestfriend has some feelings for me, because he also opens up about some weird things, like his sexual life, but also kinda not in the weird way, like the vibe is never off or uncomforable, he just talks. And I’m concerned if I or my boyfriend say anything to him, that that would ruin their friendship. Idk I just really want to protect everyone. I just don’t understand him and his intentions.",11,1759562037.0,AmIOverreacting,32,1.0,False

Although technically this neighborhood is part of Seoul, it is right on the border with Gyeonggi-do. Contrary to 99% of Seoul, the public transportation is awful, many residents rely on cars. It takes forever to go to school or to go anywhere fun. Hongdae, Hapjeong, Itaewon, Seongsu, Korea University, etc. are all over an hour away and require multiple transfers. I guess Gangnam is not too far but I don’t have any friends there and Gangnam is not really my scene anyway. All my friends live on the opposite side of the city. There aren’t any bars or coffee shops or clubs here. It’s all very family-oriented which is good for some people but for college students it’s less than ideal

I (33M) had an eye doctor appointment a few weeks ago. I recently started a new job and finally got my insurance set up, so I decided to find a new in-network optician. Luckily, I found one literally within walking distance from my office and booked an appointment with whoever was available.

When I showed up, I was scheduled with one of the female doctors. The appointment started off as usual, the assistant did some initial tests, then I waited for the optometrist to come in. As soon as she walked in, I was honestly stunned, she’s beautiful.

During the exam, she quickly picked up that we’re from the same country and share the same culture, language, and traditions. We chatted casually while she went through the exam. She asked about my job, where I live, and gave me some advice about contacts. It all felt professional but friendly nothing flirty, just comfortable conversation.

I couldn’t get my pupils dilated that day because I had to get back to work, so I booked a follow-up appointment. Now that my next visit is coming up, I’ve been thinking about asking her to grab coffee or lunch sometime. We share the same background and values, and honestly, she’s exactly the kind of woman I’d love to get to know better.

Any advice on how to approach this respectfully and without making things awkward?",1,1759561622.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

# [https://writers.whataburgermenue.com/wondering-1/](https://writers.whataburgermenue.com/wondering-1/) : Here You Go Dear

I went to my grave still wondering why my parents only loved that fake heiress even after they got me back. 

Why did even my own fiancé choose her over me? 

I died in that moldy rented room in the slums. The stomach cancer pain kept me curled up all night long. 

Even in my final moments, I still naively clung to the hope that my death would at least make them regret, and that it would finally dawn on them: I was the one they’d loved all along. 

But when my soul drifted back home, what I saw was the fake heiress beaming in her wedding dress, while my parents were busy with her wedding preparations. 

And my ashes were scattered like garbage among the rose bushes in the garden. 

No one remembered me, nor did anyone mourn me. 

I died in the rented room, less than 100 square feet, in a corner of the slums reeking of mold and decay. 

Stomach cancer gnawed at me like a dull blade, slowly severing my last thread of life. 

Curled up on a mattress with springs poking through the worn fabric, I felt life slipping through my fingers- just like all the love and warmth that should have been mine over these past 23 years slipping from me. 

As my soul left my body, I felt an unexpected sense of relief. 

There would be no more searing pain in my stomach. I no longer needed to work three jobs just to pay for medical bills and rent. I could stop crying myself to sleep every night and wondering why my birth parents didn’t love me. 

My soul floated in the air and looked down at the rotting corpse on the bed. That was me, Emily Donovan. 

I was once the heiress of the Donovan family, yet now, I was tossed aside like trash in this dark corner. 

My corpse had begun to turn greenish, with horrifying lividity marks spreading across the skin. 

My hair was dry and straw-like, and my cheeks were so sunken that I was barely recognizable as human. 

Who would have thought this skinny woman was once the dazzling heiress of the Donovan family? 

“How bitterly ironic,” I muttered to myself, even though I knew no one could hear me. “Lilith must be dressed up in designer clothes right now, being the center of attention in the Donovans.” 

Time seemed to lose all meaning in my spirit form. 

I lost track of time until the door was suddenly kicked open. 

A uniformed officer rushed in, only to stagger back out, gagging. “Holy crap, the smell is awful. She’s been dead for at least a week.” 

The officers covered their noses and cautiously edged closer to my body. 

I hovered nearby, watching as they rifled through my belongings for my ID and then called my family. 

One officer said with his phone in hand, “Hello, is that Mr. Dylan Donovan? I’m an officer at Westgate Station. I’m sorry to inform you, your daughter, Emily Donovan, passed away in her rented apartment. Preliminary assessment suggests natural causes. Yes, she’s been dead for several days…” 

I held my breath-if a soul could even do that-waiting for their reaction on the other end of the line. 

Would they cry or be shocked? Would they finally feel regret? 

“Oh, I see.” My father’s voice on the other end showed no surprise at all. “Can you please handle it for us? Just scatter her ashes anywhere possible.” 

The officer frowned and asked, “Won’t you come to claim her body?” 

“It’s not necessary. We’re busy,” my father replied, and the call ended abruptly. 

At that moment, I felt something deep in my soul shatter beyond repair. 

Even in death, the agony of being so utterly ignored cut just as sharp. 

The officer shook his head and said to his colleague, “People in rich families are so cold. I heard this girl is the Donovan family’s true heiress, but even after they found her, they never really cherished her. She ran away 

on her own.” 

“What a tragedy. Lying dead for so long before anyone noticed her,” the officer sighed. 

I was zipped into a body bag and sent to the mortuary. 

All I had was the cheapest cremation furnace-no family showed up, no formal funeral, not a single person to bid me farewell. 

My body turned to ashes in the flames, as if I had never existed at all. 

As the clerk was about to place my ashes into a cheap plastic can, a phone call came in. 

“Mr. Donovan? What, you’ve changed your mind? Of course, we’ll deliver the ashes to the place immediately,” said the clerk on the phone. 

Stunned, I found myself drifting after the hearse carrying my ashes, all the way back to Donovan Manor. 

For a moment, I couldn’t help but wonder-had they finally come to regret it? 

Could it be they still couldn’t bear to let me go? 

The car pulled up in Donovan Manor’s backyard. The gardener took the urn and dug a small hole beneath the rose bushes. 

The gardener told his assistant, “Mr. Donovan said to scatter the ashes here. They can feed the flowers. After 

all, she’s got Donovan’s blood. In the end, she rests at home.” 

I hovered numbly in the air, watching as my own ashes were poured into the earth, destined to nourish Lilith’s precious roses. 

Was this what they called “rest at home”? Was this the family love I’d always yearned for? 

Just then, laughter drifted from the house. 

I drifted through the wall and saw a party underway in the grand hall. 

Lilith stood encircled by admirers in her custom-made white gown, radiant like a princess. 

My parents, no, Dylan and Mary, looked at her with doting smiles. 

My older brother, Declan Donovan, was adjusting her necklace, his eyes brimming with brotherly affection. 

Mary opened a velvet box to reveal a diamond necklace and said, “Lilith, this is the engagement gift your father and I prepared for you. Jerry is a good man. You two are a perfect match.” 

Jerry Cooper was my former fiancé. 

He now stood beside Lilith, his arm around her waist, his eyes filled with love. 

“Thank you, Mom and Dad,” Lilith said sweetly. She stood on tiptoe to plant a kiss on Jerry’s cheek. “And thank you, Jerry, for your love.” 

The room erupted in warm laughter, while I watched the scene above, invisible and forgotten. 

Not a single person remembered that today was the day they cast my ashes into their precious garden. 

I floated right before Lilith, fixing my ghostly gaze on her delicate face. 

She suddenly shuddered and shrank into Jerry’s arms. 

“What’s wrong?” Jerry asked with concern. 

“Nothing, just felt a sudden chill.” Lilith forced a smile, though her eyes darted nervously. 

Could this woman who stole everything from me sense me? 

The party lasted well into the night. 

After all the guests left, Dylan and Mary sat in the living room, chatting while sipping coffee. 

“The police called today,” Dylan said abruptly. “They said Emily was dead.” 

Mary’s hand paused for a moment, then she gracefully resumed stirring her coffee. “Really? How did she die?” 

Dylan replied, “Stomach cancer. I had them scatter her ashes in the garden.” 

“Well.” Mary took a sip of coffee. “Lilith’s engagement to Jerry is next month. I gotta finalize their gowns and suits soon.” 

Just like that, they casually brushed off my death and moved on to discussing the menu for Lilith’s engagement party. 

I stood right before them, screaming and wailing hysterically-but of course, they couldn’t hear a single sound. 

Declan came downstairs, overhearing his parents discussing Lilith’s engagement. With a smile, he chimed in, “Lilith will look stunning in a white dress. By the way, didn’t she say she likes that Harry Winston diamond ring…” 

They were engrossed in animated discussions and plans, as though a girl named Emily had never existed in their world. 

I floated upstairs to what was once my room. 

Now it had been completely converted into Lilith’s walk-in closet. Every trace of my belongings disappeared. 

Only a small photo frame remained in the corner: a family portrait of Dylan, Mary, Declan, and Lilith. 

I was excluded from this so-called family, as if I’d never been found by them at all. 

Memories flooded back like waves. 

Three years earlier, when Dylan and Mary showed up at the restaurant where I worked, I could hardly believe 

my eyes. 

They told me a DNA test revealed there’d been a hospital mix-up when I was born. I was actually their real daughter. 

“Come home with us, dear,” Mary said, tears glistening in her eyes. 

I thought that was the start of my happily-ever-after. 

I dreamed of finally having a real family and a true home. 

I was even naive enough to believe that Lilith and I would bond as sisters. 

But reality soon shattered my illusions. 

On my very first day back at Donovan Manor, Lilith “accidentally” spilled red wine all over the only decent dress I owned. It was a birthday gift from the restaurant owner. It was the nicest piece of clothing I had. 

“Oh dear, I’m so sorry,” Lilith said, batting her innocent eyes at me. “I didn’t mean to do that, Millie. You won’t be mad at me, will you?” 

Dylan immediately comforted her. “It’s just an old dress. Lilith, I will take you shopping for a new one 

tomorrow.” 

And there I stood, my dress soaked and clinging to me, and not even a single towel was offered. 

That night, I overheard Lilith talking on the phone in her room, “Relax, that country bumpkin won’t last long. You know what, she can’t even use proper cutlery.” 

The days that followed were a living nightmare. 

No matter how hard I studied etiquette or buried myself in lessons, I could never measure up to Lilith in my family’s eyes. 

All she had to do was a few sweet words, and they’d give her everything I’d ever longed for. 

What hurt me the most was Jerry. He was meant to be my fiancé-our families had arranged our engagement the day I was born. 

“Millie, I just don’t think we’re right for each other,” Jerry told me, though his eyes kept drifting to Lilith, who was swinging on the swing in the garden. “You and Lilith… are worlds apart.” 

Yeah, we were indeed worlds apart. 

She was a rose cultivated with care, while I was just a roadside weed, ignored by all. 

The day I ran away from home, my family held a grand birthday party for Lilith. 

She wore a couture gown, looking like a true princess. 

Meanwhile, I huddled in the shadows in a borrowed dress that didn’t quite fit. 

In front of everyone, she said sweetly, “Millie, I heard you used to work in a restaurant, right? Why don’t you put on a show for us and demonstrate how you used to carry trays?” 

Amidst the laughter of the guests, I saw Dylan and Mary laughing too, and even Declan couldn’t help but chuckle. 

Jerry stood with his arm possessively around Lilith’s waist. He gazed at her with doting amusement as she delivered her cruel performance. 

That night, I packed my few meager belongings, left a letter behind, and walked out of Donovan Manor without a single backward glance. 

It had been three years since I walked out of that door. 

Over the past three years, I scraped by on countless odd jobs, slept rough under bridges, and finally ended up in this dingy rented room in the slums. 

I worked myself to the bone, desperate to prove I could survive without the Donovan family. 

But then stomach cancer came for me, and I couldn’t afford treatment. 

Even in my final moments, I still clung to the naive hope that my death would make the Donovans regret, and that it would finally dawn on them that they’d loved me all along. 

But now, watching them bustling about for Lilith’s engagement, it finally dawned on me that to them, my life and death were nothing significant. 

As a spirit, I knew tears were impossible. 

Yet scalding trails still ran down my cheeks. 

I drifted into the garden, watching my own ashes sink into the soil. 

“Is this how my story ends?” I asked the night sky, but only silence answered. 

The house’s lights still blazed brightly, faint laughter drifting through the night. 

Lilith’s life would keep shining, while I’d forever be just ashes nourishing her roses. 

How bitterly ironic my life was.

The officers covered their noses and cautiously edged closer to my body. 

I hovered nearby, watching as they rifled through my belongings for my ID and then called my family. 

One officer said with his phone in hand, “Hello, is that Mr. Dylan Donovan? I’m an officer at Westgate Station. I’m sorry to inform you, your daughter, Emily Donovan, passed away in her rented apartment. Preliminary assessment suggests natural causes. Yes, she’s been dead for several days…” 

I held my breath-if a soul could even do that-waiting for their reaction on the other end of the line. 

Would they cry or be shocked? Would they finally feel regret? 

“Oh, I see.” My father’s voice on the other end showed no surprise at all. “Can you please handle it for us? Just scatter her ashes anywhere possible.” 

The officer frowned and asked, “Won’t you come to claim her body?” 

“It’s not necessary. We’re busy,” my father replied, and the call ended abruptly. 

At that moment, I felt something deep in my soul shatter beyond repair. 

Even in death, the agony of being so utterly ignored cut just as sharp. 

The officer shook his head and said to his colleague, “People in rich families are so cold. I heard this girl is the Donovan family’s true heiress, but even after they found her, they never really cherished her. She ran away 

on her own.” 

“What a tragedy. Lying dead for so long before anyone noticed her,” the officer sighed. 

I was zipped into a body bag and sent to the mortuary. 

All I had was the cheapest cremation furnace-no family showed up, no formal funeral, not a single person to bid me farewell. 

My body turned to ashes in the flames, as if I had never existed at all. 

As the clerk was about to place my ashes into a cheap plastic can, a phone call came in. 

“Mr. Donovan? What, you’ve changed your mind? Of course, we’ll deliver the ashes to the place immediately,” said the clerk on the phone. 

Stunned, I found myself drifting after the hearse carrying my ashes, all the way back to Donovan Manor. 

For a moment, I couldn’t help but wonder-had they finally come to regret it? 

Could it be they still couldn’t bear to let me go? 

The car pulled up in Donovan Manor’s backyard. The gardener took the urn and dug a small hole beneath the rose bushes. 

The gardener told his assistant, “Mr. Donovan said to scatter the ashes here. They can feed the flowers. After 

all, she’s got Donovan’s blood. In the end, she rests at home.” 

I hovered numbly in the air, watching as my own ashes were poured into the earth, destined to nourish Lilith’s precious roses. 

Was this what they called “rest at home”? Was this the family love I’d always yearned for? 

Just then, laughter drifted from the house. 

I drifted through the wall and saw a party underway in the grand hall. 

Lilith stood encircled by admirers in her custom-made white gown, radiant like a princess. 

My parents, no, Dylan and Mary, looked at her with doting smiles. 

My older brother, Declan Donovan, was adjusting her necklace, his eyes brimming with brotherly affection. 

Mary opened a velvet box to reveal a diamond necklace and said, “Lilith, this is the engagement gift your father and I prepared for you. Jerry is a good man. You two are a perfect match.” 

Jerry Cooper was my former fiancé. 

He now stood beside Lilith, his arm around her waist, his eyes filled with love. 

“Thank you, Mom and Dad,” Lilith said sweetly. She stood on tiptoe to plant a kiss on Jerry’s cheek. “And thank you, Jerry, for your love.” 

The room erupted in warm laughter, while I watched the scene above, invisible and forgotten. 

Not a single person remembered that today was the day they cast my ashes into their precious garden. 

I floated right before Lilith, fixing my ghostly gaze on her delicate face. 

She suddenly shuddered and shrank into Jerry’s arms. 

“What’s wrong?” Jerry asked with concern. 

“Nothing, just felt a sudden chill.” Lilith forced a smile, though her eyes darted nervously. 

Could this woman who stole everything from me sense me? 

The party lasted well into the night. 

After all the guests left, Dylan and Mary sat in the living room, chatting while sipping coffee. 

“The police called today,” Dylan said abruptly. “They said Emily was dead.” 

Mary’s hand paused for a moment, then she gracefully resumed stirring her coffee. “Really? How did she die?” 

Dylan replied, “Stomach cancer. I had them scatter her ashes in the garden.” 

“Well.” Mary took a sip of coffee. “Lilith’s engagement to Jerry is next month. I gotta finalize their gowns and suits soon.” 

Just like that, they casually brushed off my death and moved on to discussing the menu for Lilith’s engagement party. 

I stood right before them, screaming and wailing hysterically-but of course, they couldn’t hear a single sound. 

Declan came downstairs, overhearing his parents discussing Lilith’s engagement. With a smile, he chimed in, “Lilith will look stunning in a white dress. By the way, didn’t she say she likes that Harry Winston diamond ring…” 

They were engrossed in animated discussions and plans, as though a girl named Emily had never existed in their world. 

I floated upstairs to what was once my room. 

Now it had been completely converted into Lilith’s walk-in closet. Every trace of my belongings disappeared. 

Only a small photo frame remained in the corner: a family portrait of Dylan, Mary, Declan, and Lilith. 

I was excluded from this so-called family, as if I’d never been found by them at all. 

Memories flooded back like waves. 

Three years earlier, when Dylan and Mary showed up at the restaurant where I worked, I could hardly believe 

my eyes. 

They told me a DNA test revealed there’d been a hospital mix-up when I was born. I was actually their real daughter. 

“Come home with us, dear,” Mary said, tears glistening in her eyes. 

I thought that was the start of my happily-ever-after. 

I dreamed of finally having a real family and a true home. 

I was even naive enough to believe that Lilith and I would bond as sisters. 

But reality soon shattered my illusions. 

On my very first day back at Donovan Manor, Lilith “accidentally” spilled red wine all over the only decent dress I owned. It was a birthday gift from the restaurant owner. It was the nicest piece of clothing I had. 

“Oh dear, I’m so sorry,” Lilith said, batting her innocent eyes at me. “I didn’t mean to do that, Millie. You won’t be mad at me, will you?” 

Dylan immediately comforted her. “It’s just an old dress. Lilith, I will take you shopping for a new one 

tomorrow.” 

And there I stood, my dress soaked and clinging to me, and not even a single towel was offered. 

That night, I overheard Lilith talking on the phone in her room, “Relax, that country bumpkin won’t last long. You know what, she can’t even use proper cutlery.” 

The days that followed were a living nightmare. 

No matter how hard I studied etiquette or buried myself in lessons, I could never measure up to Lilith in my family’s eyes. 

All she had to do was a few sweet words, and they’d give her everything I’d ever longed for. 

What hurt me the most was Jerry. He was meant to be my fiancé-our families had arranged our engagement the day I was born. 

“Millie, I just don’t think we’re right for each other,” Jerry told me, though his eyes kept drifting to Lilith, who was swinging on the swing in the garden. “You and Lilith… are worlds apart.” 

Yeah, we were indeed worlds apart. 

She was a rose cultivated with care, while I was just a roadside weed, ignored by all. 

The day I ran away from home, my family held a grand birthday party for Lilith. 

She wore a couture gown, looking like a true princess. 

Meanwhile, I huddled in the shadows in a borrowed dress that didn’t quite fit. 

In front of everyone, she said sweetly, “Millie, I heard you used to work in a restaurant, right? Why don’t you put on a show for us and demonstrate how you used to carry trays?” 

Amidst the laughter of the guests, I saw Dylan and Mary laughing too, and even Declan couldn’t help but chuckle. 

Jerry stood with his arm possessively around Lilith’s waist. He gazed at her with doting amusement as she delivered her cruel performance. 

That night, I packed my few meager belongings, left a letter behind, and walked out of Donovan Manor without a single backward glance. 

It had been three years since I walked out of that door. 

Over the past three years, I scraped by on countless odd jobs, slept rough under bridges, and finally ended up in this dingy rented room in the slums. 

I worked myself to the bone, desperate to prove I could survive without the Donovan family. 

But then stomach cancer came for me, and I couldn’t afford treatment. 

Even in my final moments, I still clung to the naive hope that my death would make the Donovans regret, and that it would finally dawn on them that they’d loved me all along. 

But now, watching them bustling about for Lilith’s engagement, it finally dawned on me that to them, my life and death were nothing significant. 

As a spirit, I knew tears were impossible. 

Yet scalding trails still ran down my cheeks. 

I drifted into the garden, watching my own ashes sink into the soil. 

“Is this how my story ends?” I asked the night sky, but only silence answered. 

The house’s lights still blazed brightly, faint laughter drifting through the night. 

Lilith’s life would keep shining, while I’d forever be just ashes nourishing her roses. 

How bitterly ironic my life was.

# [https://writers.whataburgermenue.com/wondering-1/](https://writers.whataburgermenue.com/wondering-1/) : Here You Go Dear

I went to my grave still wondering why my parents only loved that fake heiress even after they got me back. 

Why did even my own fiancé choose her over me? 

I died in that moldy rented room in the slums. The stomach cancer pain kept me curled up all night long. 

Even in my final moments, I still naively clung to the hope that my death would at least make them regret, and that it would finally dawn on them: I was the one they’d loved all along. 

But when my soul drifted back home, what I saw was the fake heiress beaming in her wedding dress, while my parents were busy with her wedding preparations. 

And my ashes were scattered like garbage among the rose bushes in the garden. 

No one remembered me, nor did anyone mourn me. 

I died in the rented room, less than 100 square feet, in a corner of the slums reeking of mold and decay. 

Stomach cancer gnawed at me like a dull blade, slowly severing my last thread of life. 

Curled up on a mattress with springs poking through the worn fabric, I felt life slipping through my fingers- just like all the love and warmth that should have been mine over these past 23 years slipping from me. 

As my soul left my body, I felt an unexpected sense of relief. 

There would be no more searing pain in my stomach. I no longer needed to work three jobs just to pay for medical bills and rent. I could stop crying myself to sleep every night and wondering why my birth parents didn’t love me. 

My soul floated in the air and looked down at the rotting corpse on the bed. That was me, Emily Donovan. 

I was once the heiress of the Donovan family, yet now, I was tossed aside like trash in this dark corner. 

My corpse had begun to turn greenish, with horrifying lividity marks spreading across the skin. 

My hair was dry and straw-like, and my cheeks were so sunken that I was barely recognizable as human. 

Who would have thought this skinny woman was once the dazzling heiress of the Donovan family? 

“How bitterly ironic,” I muttered to myself, even though I knew no one could hear me. “Lilith must be dressed up in designer clothes right now, being the center of attention in the Donovans.” 

Time seemed to lose all meaning in my spirit form. 

I lost track of time until the door was suddenly kicked open. 

A uniformed officer rushed in, only to stagger back out, gagging. “Holy crap, the smell is awful. She’s been dead for at least a week.” 

The officers covered their noses and cautiously edged closer to my body.

1nxn5k1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nxn5k1/the_empty_toilet_paper_roll_that_sparked_a/,The Empty Toilet Paper Roll That Sparked a Revolution,"I swear, my villain origin story was almost written over an empty toilet paper roll. Again. It was 7 AM, a crisp autumn morning, and I'd just woken up to the unsettling reality that not only was the bathroom roll bone-dry, but the entire linen closet was, too. This wasn't the first time, but it felt like the final, soggy straw in a long list of minor-but-maddening household issues in our suburban house.

Living with Liam, Chloe, and Maya was usually chill, no cap. Liam, our resident chill tech enthusiast, was perpetually in his own coding world. Chloe, an aspiring photographer, was a social butterfly, always out at events or shoots. And Maya, our quiet grad student, was super responsible but didn’t always speak up. I loved them, honestly, but my patience was wearing thin. Like, who keeps using the last of something and just… *leaves* the empty cardboard tube? That’s sending me.

I stormed out of the bathroom, bathrobe flapping, and saw Chloe already in the kitchen, making her green smoothie. “Chloe,” I started, trying to keep my voice even, “do we have any toilet paper? Anywhere?”

She looked up, unfazed. “Oh, I thought Liam was gonna grab some yesterday. I put it on the shopping list on the fridge, remember?” She gestured to a pristine, color-coded whiteboard with “TP” written in an almost aggressively neat font. I glanced at it. Underneath, in messy scrawl, was Liam’s “Got it!” from three days ago. Classic.

Later that day, after an emergency corner-store run (my third this month, btw), I knew we needed an intervention. Not, like, a dramatic one, but a serious chat. My internal monologue was basically a spreadsheet of grievances: dirty dishes left by the sink, communal coffee grounds emptied but not replaced, the phantom last slice of pizza. I knew everyone was busy, but come on. This was basic adulting, and I was lowkey carrying the mental load for the entire house.

That evening, I highkey corralled everyone into the living room. “Okay, guys, we need to talk,” I started, feeling a bit like the house mom, which I never wanted to be. “The toilet paper situation today was… a moment. But it’s not just that. We need a system for shared supplies and chores, for real.” Liam, ever chill, just shrugged. “Yeah, I keep forgetting. My bad, truly.” Maya nodded shyly. Chloe, however, had an entire presentation ready. She pulled out her phone, “I actually found this app that helps with chore rotation and shared expenses. We could try it?”

I was skeptical, but desperate. We spent the next hour hashing it out. We assigned specific chores, set up a shared grocery list on Chloe’s app, and even agreed to a “communal dinner” night once a week to actually connect. It wasn’t just about the chores, I realized; it was about acknowledging we’re a team.

The next week, things actually shifted. Liam, shockingly, remembered his dish duty. Maya started speaking up more, even suggesting we try a new recipe for our first communal dinner. And me? I found myself laughing when Liam *actually* restocked the toilet paper before it ran out. It was a small win, but honestly, it felt huge. That night, over Maya’s bomb pasta, we talked, we laughed, and it felt like we weren’t just housemates anymore, but a genuine crew. We love to see it.

Living with others honestly hits different when everyone’s on the same page. If you’re navigating shared living, HomeCo makes it simple to coordinate chores, split bills, and keep the peace. Because the best house stories happen when the logistics just work.

Figured I’d put this out into the universe - sometimes the best stories start with a simple hello. I’m 29M, living in Bangalore, hoping to meet a wonderful woman who’s genuine, kind, and a little adventurous to share life (and lots of late-night conversations) with.

I’m the type who can enjoy a quiet coffee on a rainy evening just as much as a spontaneous road trip out of the city.

Big believer in good vibes, good food, and the magic of small moments.

Friends would describe me as thoughtful, a little witty, and someone who knows how to make people feel comfortable.


About you (hopefully):

Someone who loves to laugh, explore, and isn’t afraid of getting a little cheesy sometimes.

A romantic at heart (or at least willing to put up with one 😅).

**Why This Pick?** 

I expect an exceptional game out of Kevin Gausman (3.59 ERA) here. 4 of Gausman’s last 5 starts haven’t seen final totals of Over 8 runs. On the other side, New York starter Luis Gil (3.32 ERA) can boast that 4 of his last 5 starts for the Yankees have yielded collective totals of Under 5. As luck would have it, not only have the last 3 straight meetings between these teams seen 8 runs or less, but Gil’s last outing against the Blue Jays saw him hold the Toronto offense to just 3 hits.  I’m expecting a solid pitching duel for Game 1 of this playoff series. I won’t pick a winner, but I imagine the final score will fall around 3-1. My money’s on the Under to cash.

Ill ask something akin to 'will I need to make coffee on the day of such and such'. They get upset and go off on me as I should know how to make coffee, I should have been doing this daily and preparing for coffee. What do you mean I dont know what coffee is???

You know when you can tell they think you are slowly getting dumber and dumber by the moment. They are so intense and take everything so seriously. They are absolutely ride or die about everything, and cannot understand the concept that some people are just there to be there. For the paycheck essentially.

I absolutely hate this. 

I have time. I will lose my weekend over it entirely, maybe pull an all nighter but I have the time.

This will pass, the stress will pass this is going to be the worst few weeks imaginable.

1nxn1ah,https://www.reddit.com/r/10xfreelancing/comments/1nxn1ah/automatically_archiving_projects/,Automatically Archiving Projects,"I built a dumb little Apps Script to auto-archive Notion projects… and accidentally cleaned 6 months of Google Drive chaos in 11 minutes

If you’ve ever promised yourself “I’ll clean this up on Friday,” and then it’s suddenly Q4 and everything is still sitting in the same messy folder… hi, it’s me. I run a spreadsheet that pulls in all our Notion projects. Every week I was supposed to manually:

- Find projects marked inactive/archived in Notion
- Open the Google Doc linked in the project
- Rename it to show it was archived
- Move it to the archived folder

It’s fine when there are 2-3. It’s hell when there are 30+. I kept punting it “to the weekend.” Spoiler: I do not spend my weekends archiving Docs.

So I built an Apps Script that:
- Pulls project rows from the sheet
- Filters to anything inactive/archived
- Parses the Google Doc URL from each row
- Finds the file in a specific folder (to avoid yeeting random docs across Drive)
- If the name doesn’t already include “ARCHIVED,” appends a timestamped archive tag
- Moves the file to an Archived folder
- Runs automatically every week

The first run archived 84 docs in 4 mins and, tbh, I literally threw up in my mouth a little seeing how many I’d been ignoring.

The Setup (and Why I Finally Did It)
- Data source: Notion database → synced into a Google Sheet we call “BFD Finance Coolsheet” via a separate process. Each row includes:
  - Project Name
  - Status (Active, Inactive, Archived)
  - Google Doc URL (primary doc for the project)
  - Team, Owner, Dates, etc.
- Destination: Google Drive, with:
  - “Active Projects” folder (the working directory)
  - “Archived Projects” folder (where docs should go to die)
- Constraint: Only touch files that:
  - Exist in the Active Projects folder
  - Belong to projects labeled Inactive/Archived in Notion
- Goal: 100% hands-off every week. No more manual renaming/moving.

The Tech Stack (nothing fancy)
- Google Sheets
- Apps Script (for the automation)
- Google Drive API (Advanced Service in Apps Script) for reliable moves on Shared Drives
- Time-based Trigger (weekly Monday 6:15 AM)
- One “Archive Log” sheet for receipts (because someone will always ask “what happened to X?”)

The Twist I Didn’t Expect

After the first run, our CFO pinged me, “Why does our Drive search suddenly look sane?” Turns out, removing 80+ stale docs from “Active Projects” reduced random search noise so much that onboarding a new analyst was actually… easy? People could find things. Wild.

Also, the archive timestamp ended up being surprisingly helpful in post-mortems. We could answer “When did we close this out?” without guessing.

The Weekly Flow Now (aka set-and-forget)
- Mondays at 6:15 AM
  - Script runs in ~90–120 seconds
  - Renames “Project Foo” → “Project Foo — ARCHIVED 2025-10-06”
  - Moves to Archived folder
  - Logs results to the Archive Log sheet
  - Emails me a summary:
    - Processed: 9
    - Skipped (already archived): 3
    - Missing/broken URLs: 2
    - Permission issues: 1

I drink coffee. I do not click-and-drag files like a medieval scribe.

Real Talk:
- I should’ve done this months ago. I avoided it because “writing automation will take longer than just doing it once.” Cute lie.
- If you run any content or ops team: weekly cleanup tasks WILL NOT get done manually at scale. Automate or drown.
- Guardrails matter more than clever code. Dry-runs, logs, idempotency, role-based permissions. You don’t want to nuke a folder at 6:15 AM while you’re brushing your teeth.

Actionable Takeaways You Can Steal
- Use a single source of truth (Notion) but process in Sheets. Apps Script + Sheets is just easier than hitting Notion API for this kind of ops task.
- Only move files if they’re in the expected parent folder. That single check saved me from chaos.
- Tag with dates: “— ARCHIVED YYYY-MM-DD” is predictable and search-friendly.
- Build a dry-run mode. Print what you would do, to a log sheet. Flip the boolean later.
- Log everything. FileId, old name, new name, time, result. You’ll thank yourself when someone asks “where’d my doc go?”
- Use Advanced Drive API for Shared Drives. DriveApp will lie to you and smile.
- Cache processed fileIds. Prevents weekly re-tagging and helps with idempotency.
- Default skip on unknown MIME types. Don’t move folders. Just don’t.

The Numbers After 4 Weeks (because I know some of you track ROI)
- Manual time saved: ~3 hours/month (low estimate)
- Errors prevented: 2 accidental moves caught by guardrails (not in active folder)
- New backlog prevented: 31 docs auto-archived over 4 weeks
- Team “where is that doc?” pings: down anecdotally by a lot (I didn’t measure, I’m not that organized, but people stopped slacking me at 9 PM about “that old deck,” so… W)

Mistakes I Still Own (humbling edition)
- I misspelled “ARCHIVED” as “ARCHIEVE” on 7 files before I noticed. Equal parts embarrassing and hilarious. Fixed it with a quick cleanup script.
- I left the time-based trigger at an odd time (6:15 AM) and spent 10 minutes trying to remember why my Monday summaries always landed mid-shower. I am, in fact, the IT guy and the problem.

TL;DR
Built an Apps Script to:
- Read Notion projects from a Google Sheet
- Filter to Inactive/Archived
- Parse Doc URL → fileId
- If the file is in the Active Projects folder and not already tagged, rename to “— ARCHIVED YYYY-MM-DD” and move to Archived folder
- Run weekly with logs + email summary

First run: 84 docs archived in 4 minutes . Now it quietly handles 6–12/week and I get my sanity back.

If you want my sheet headers, the guardrail checks, or the dry-run logger template, drop “script” and I’ll share a cleaned-up version. If you’ve done something similar but better, please roast my approach—I’m happy to steal your good ideas.

P.S. Story is real, used AI to write it more cleanly. I’m still the idiot who wrote “ARCHIEVE.”",1,1759560851.0,10xfreelancing,0,1.0,False

1nxmze2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nxmze2/hr_moon_flower_part_1/,[HR] Moon Flower (Part 1),"Laura Stapleton sat with her best friend, Sydney Lyons, in the weedy grass by a sprawling man-made mud puddle, aka campus lake, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. Golden leaves trundled down onto the water, matching the afternoon sun, and they smoked Parliament lights under the pretense of studying. They talked and laughed while a fishy breeze sent their lacy blue smoke wobbling up into the warm autumn sky. Laura went quiet for a moment, her gaze fixed on a sprinkle of maple leaves softly landing on the placid surface of the water.

“YO! Earth to Major Laura…are you still here!?” Syd teased, giving Laura’s shoulder a playful nudge.

Laura snapped out of it, as if she'd been lost in a far-off world. She crushed out her P-funk and suddenly divulged, ""My plant physiology Prof, Dr. O'Shaughnessy, is fucking fine!""

""...OH MY GOD, you totally want to bang him! You want to have like a million of his babies!!!"" Sydney squealed as she flopped around in the grass like a hyper ferret.

Laura tried to suppress a weird sheepish grin, but it broke through, making the corners of her lips curl and distort the freckles on her dimpled cheeks.

""So WHAT!? And no, just NO, yuck! He's the sponsor of the Germplasm Club, and he’s like 50!""

""Oh my god you SLUT!"" Sydney yapped, loud enough for a couple on a blanket nearby to look over.

Laura pounced on top of her like a lemur and put her hands over Sydney’s mouth, stifling more muffled indignities.

""Shut up asshole! I will drown you!"" Laura whispered, only 65% joking.

In all the excitement, Syd let out a small fart that sounded like a tiny trumpet — *FFfffiiiirrrrrrpppp*. Their eyes locked and simultaneously grew wide. They were both silent for a split second then seized into spasms of snorting, writhing laughter. They were both rolling and convulsing with the giggles so hard they weren't even making noise anymore, just wheezing for air.

“Ahhhrrrgggh stahp stahp…I’m gonna pee myself!” Laura gasped, teary and red faced.

“I…I…I think I did!” Syd squeaked.

Laura sat up with leaves in her hair and glanced at her watch, “oh shit dude, I gotta go grab some food and actually study before the Germplasm Club meeting tonight. Wanna come with?”

“Guhhh, I really would but I’m supposed to hang out with Scott and his stupid friends this afternoon, bleehhhggg.”

“Okay, you have fun with that, I’ll catch you later chicky,” she said and grabbed her stuff, leaving her friend flopped backwards in the grass.

Syd lifted her head up, giving her double chins, “hey, can I get a road ciggie?”

Laura sighed, knowing it was coming, and fished one out her pack then tossed it near her face.

“Hey, watch it! Practice safe sex slut!” Syd teased.

Laura smirked and gave her double birds before heading off towards a shared rental house just north of campus. Along her route towards the run down bungalow she split with three other girls and their rotating cast of man boys, she passed by a kind of sunken woods. It was, more accurately, an old drainage field with trees, surrounded by parking lots at the north west corner of the arboreal campus. Her imagination wandered as she strolled past the swampy grove, and giggled under her breath at what the squirrels were saying about her.

“*Whoa…there she is….there she is….there she is….SHIT…don’t make eye contact!*” they chittered.

*There she is indeed,* she chuckled, but then did a double take. “Wait, what the fuck!?” she said out loud.

She stopped and surveyed the soggy mosquito infested woods, abruptly making eye contact with two nervous looking squirrels by a nearby oak. They dropped their acorns and darted up its trunk to safety, chittering like normal squirrels as they ran.

*Well that doesn’t make much sense. No, not a damn bit. Maybe I should call mom… damn I’m fuckin hungry!*

Laura chalked up the squirrel hallucination to too much coffee and weed, not enough sleep, and a desperate need for sustenance. Her mind was now singularly fixed on the image of her roommate’s half eaten Quatro's Challenge pizza, sitting unguarded in the fridge. If there was no one at home to defend it, and at this time of day there usually wasn't, it was done for. As soon as she got home she scarfed down most of the pie with the refrigerator door hanging open as she fed. Suddenly realizing what she was doing, she stopped herself from finishing the entire pizza, leaving one and a half slices in the box as a sad attempt at salvation.

It was all a big joke though, this dumb college life — the way everyone was caught up in becoming something else, the way it all seemed so trivial at the capricious age of twenty-one. She plopped down on the ratty couch in the living room and made a half-hearted attempt to study for her Plant Phys. class, but it was not happening. The more she looked at her notes, the more she found herself geeking out over Dr. O’Shaughnessy. He couldn’t have been much older than 40 actually, in decent shape, good hair, cool black glasses…and then there was that odd, sky-like distance in his eyes.

*Yeah, what is that? That weird, cute thing in his eyes? And those arm tattoos, peeking out from under his rolled up sleeves — was he in the army something? He smelled really good too.*

“And goddamn, WHY AM I SO RANDY?” she laughed out loud. At least, she thought she did, adding, “holy hell…I need a nap.”

She set her watch alarm for 6 p.m., plenty of time for a little shut-eye before the club meeting later that evening. Just before sinking into a heavy, late-day zonk, she thought: What’s the worst that could happen? It’s just a little fun. You’re allowed to go a little crazy sometimes. But maybe not tonight… did I miss a call from mom?

Laura walked back across campus that evening to the club meeting at the teaching greenhouse as the sun was setting behind a growing wall of clouds. Sodium streetlights buzzed on, casting an artificial orange glow on the sidewalk. The wind picked up and she pulled her flouncy red hair into a knot with a pen to stop it from blowing into her face. As she got closer to the greenhouse next to the Ag. building, she saw bright white fluorescent lights reflected off the mostly cloudy sky. She could see through the foggy glass the meeting was already underway. She slinked in through rowdy conservations and posted up in the back, trying not to make intentional eye contact with Dr. O who was now shouting over the chatter about plans for the club's upcoming Fall Rare Bleeding Fair.

*No, he said BREEDING, not bleeding.*

It began to occur to her that she’d been planning something stupid all along, in spite of herself. She decided to wait until the end of the meeting, after everyone else had left, and then ask about the midterm Plant Phys. project, that was it.

*""The worst lies are the lies we tell ourselves""... wasn’t that from those Ferret books?* she wondered, gnawing at a nail. *Was it…longer than usual?*

But I have quit heroin and other addictive drugs earlier in my life and caffeine is 100X harder to quit for me. I truly can look back and feel how I felt then and say that I have found everything else easy to quit. For Me there is something about caffeine where it is especially efficient at suppressing certain emotions (a kind of dark loneliness and dread that I have spent my life avoiding since childhood) and I believe this is why it’s so hard to quit for me. Even when I was withdrawing from opiates I’d have a sort of happiness about being able to feel alive again (as I drank pots of coffee). I genuinely believe at this point that I’d never have any other addictions if it weren’t for the combination of caffeine wrecking my nervous system while keeping corrosive emotions underneath the surface. Affective Neuroscience corroborates this theory, it’s not woo woo. 

In the past week I’ve read Allen Carr’s Easyway to quit caffeine, Ruth Whalen’s “Welcome To The Dance”, started reading Caffeine Blues, collected and listened to compelling YouTube videos about quitting caffeine and I’m still having a hard time dropping it. I’ve quit before and didn’t last longer than six months, but I’ve learned a lot about repressed emotions being the driving force of addiction and I’ve done the work on myself but the absolute last block to my freedom is caffeine acting as a dam against a certain set of traumatic affects I’ve been absolutely unable to stomach.

I’m not saying this is the case for everyone here but I am totally sincere that for me, quitting opioids and nicotine are a walk in the park compared to quitting caffeine.

I don’t say this to make you afraid, just to say that subjectively it’s not always easy to quit this. I’m just realizing my ability to quit is relative to my willingness to fully feel, process/complete the emotions caffeine alone works to suppress.

Anyways if you are having a lot of trouble quitting, suspect it’s really hindering your joy and freedom, and people roll their eyes at you, just know you’re not weak. 

This might be illuminating if like me you have managed to quit for a while, know that caffeine is a fundamental problem, but can’t seem to get past the tug of war.

Together with my brother, we just launched our first iOS app: **ReMe – short for “Remind Me”**. It helps you keep track of things like vouchers, bills, subscriptions, tickets and debts. The idea is as simple as it is good.

We’ve been talking for years about building something together and starting our own company. This year, we finally did it.

ReMe was built over many evenings and weekends besides our full time jobs, with lots of trial and error (and lots of coffee). But for sure the real game changer was the help of AI.

The result is a simple, fast, and private app — designed just for iOS. Just one goal: help you remember the stuff that usually slips through.

There’s an optional **premium version for $1.99/year**, which unlocks features like:

* creating your own reminders & calendar entries from the app
* viewing your archive and full timeline
* no InApp ads
* iCloud functionality
* ...

But the free version just works as good as the premium one.

1. The Eon Eagle. NOT to be confused with the Hour Hawk. Or the Olympiad Osprey. Or that hunk of junk Millenium Falcon.

2. metallireducens SR 72.

3. ""Arn't you too short to be a Normandy NMS?"" Yes. Build limit of 100 said I have to make it 1 full habitat shorter in length. It's not the length that matters right?

4. Generic Imperial space ship. Giant Hurt ball was too expensive. And those pesky rebels like blowing them up makes them prohibitively to replace.

5. F-14ish looking fighter ship for those times when you feel the need for speed.

6. Some experimental B-wing asymmetrical fork ship.

7. Seventh Sun MF7. What does the MF stand for? Not Monday through Friday.

As soon as I go into Workshop and move over on the menu bar, the game crashes to desktop. I've double checked on lastest versions of things, and nothing is flagging that it needs a patch either.

Anyone else have this issue or know how to solve it?

I am traditional sweet I have been totally celibate all my life and I’m seeking a serious relationship with a sweet woman 25-32 I like American women! I am very open and honest about myself on this long post!,"Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.

Added in a few mini marshmallows for a mix in and then manually added a packet of mini marshmallow Oreo’s. Red food dye for the colour ! 

These are my favorite flavour essences I’ve found. (W.A. Australia version) The Loraine’s are from bakers world online. ‘Robert’s’ (loads of flavours and are really good!) are from Spotlight in the cake bakers section and ‘Whittington’s’ were  found in spud shed (they also do maple/caramel flavours). My favourites are the rum (rum raisin, also goes well with coffee for tiramisu vibes) , marshmallow, coconut (coconut with the rum is also really good!) , caramel and peppermint for chocolate mint. 

I get the ‘simply Delish’ pudding mix from Amazon or ‘low carb emporium’ but the Aeroplane light mousse or custard does the same job! ",6,1759559578.0,ninjacreami,4,1.0,False

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy.

""Yeah, I see them here."" 

*THEN WHY ARE TALKING?*

So far, we've had the car fire half a hundred people called about, a club shootout with multiple victims that no one called about, a double coke/fent overdose in a drive-thru lane, one lady called very upset about strangers (the utility company) coming to her (left a notice about shutting off her water because she hasn't been paying her bills) and she doesn't like strange people coming to her door (she wasn't even home at the time), and we've apparently got a new crazy caller, this one convinced people are living in his vents and stealing his urine from inside his body to power their lasers. 

At this point, I can only assume Mercury is in retrograde relative to Jupiter, the Moon is upside down in a prograde orbit, and Venus and Mars are on a collision course.

1nxmj75,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1nxmj75/stoicism_and_mourninghealth_anxiety/,Stoicism and mourning/health anxiety,"Hi all,

I am not sure what I’m looking for, any advice or similar stories will help I think.
I think I am not totally bad at applying stoicism on my daily life. Having two children has also taught me a lot.
However, when it is about something bigger or more challenging, I get anxious and I am the opposite of stoic.

A month ago I lost a good friend of mine (a former work colleague) to cancer. She was a few months younger than me (I just turned 40), also had two kids… we had a lot in common. It was a tough experience. I felt very sad, but I also felt other emotions I wouldn’t have imagined like fear and anxiety of being in her situation, because if it happened to her, why wouldn’t it happen to me? I suffer from some health anxiety and hypochondria in general too.

Over this month, I started speaking with a therapist and I’ve been reading about stoicism to treat my health anxiety. A week ago my husband told me about a work colleague in a different country (they have never met in person) who he had seen on LinkedIn… his wife had started a crowdfunding because he was diagnosed with a deadly cancer and she needed money to make some adjustments at home and also to travel with him before he dies. I tend to ruminate on this kind of news, but this time I thought it was a good opportunity to practice stoicism and I did, it didn’t really affect me. “I made a lot of progress”, I thought. 

Yesterday, I met with two old friends from my former job with whom I recovered contact during the funeral of our friend. We got along really well but due to life and obligations we hadn’t seen each other for years. It was great to see them. At some point, I asked one of them about a colleague I hadn’t heard of for a while, and while we weren’t super close, we used to hang out together for lunch and he was a really awesome, smart and kind guy. I knew he had moved abroad, he was doing very well in life (in terms of career, family, etc). She told me “oh… you didn’t know? He died last year”. He also had cancer. I couldn’t believe it. We were about to leave but went grab a coffee because I just couldn’t leave and go home at that point.

I can’t stop thinking about him or my friend now, I visualize them sick and weak in their last days. This was yesterday, so it is recent, it’s normal to feel sadness, but last night I felt very anxious. It took me two hours to fall asleep, I used Headspace with a guided meditation and it didn’t really work this time. I tried breathing techniques but I’m not sure it helped. I tend to get tense around my jaw area when I’m stressed and I can really feel it this morning.

Also, I feel disappointed as I didn’t react the way I thought I was capable of thanks to the work I’ve been doing. I know stoicism is an ideal, it’s not fully reachable, and I know also this is a journey… I accept all that, but I guess I had expected more of myself in such a situation.

1nxmggq,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1nxmggq/befreed_best_notebooklm_alternative_for_personal/,BeFreed: Best NotebookLM Alternative for Personal Growth (2025 Guide),"The AI revolution is reshaping how we learn and grow. In 2025, the surge of **AI knowledge and productivity tools** like NotebookLM, Gemini, and BeFreed has transformed how individuals digest information and build long-term skills. With personalized podcast learning and adaptive study plans, [BeFreed](https://www.befreed.ai/) is emerging as the **best NotebookLM alternative for personal growth** — a tool built not just for note summarization but for *real transformation*.

According to a 2025 report by [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai), over **60% of professionals now use AI-driven tools** to accelerate personal learning and decision-making, reflecting a global shift toward microlearning and intelligent knowledge systems. Likewise, *Harvard Business Review* notes that personalization is the next frontier of learning — users are no longer content with static summaries; they want context, adaptability, and retention.

This article explores how BeFreed bridges that gap — combining the cognitive science of learning with next-generation AI to help people learn faster, remember longer, and grow purposefully.

## The Rise of AI-Powered Personal Growth Tools

Over the past two years, AI has redefined how people acquire knowledge. *Deloitte’s 2025 Human Capital Report* found that **73% of workers under 35** now use AI learning apps weekly to upskill, while *Statista* projects that the global market for **AI-based personal-development tools** will exceed **$30 billion by 2026**.

Yet most platforms still focus on summarization, not transformation. [BeFreed](https://www.befreed.ai/) stands apart by fusing **cognitive-science principles** like spaced repetition, dual-coding, and contextual learning into its AI model. Studies from *Stanford Graduate School of Education* (2024) show that **personalized microlearning increases retention by up to 40%**, validating BeFreed’s adaptive design.

## How BeFreed Leads the New Wave of AI Podcast Learning Apps

### 1. Flexible Learning Lengths for Every Schedule

Traditional book-summary apps restrict users to rigid 15-minute sessions. BeFreed breaks that mold by letting you **choose your learning depth**:

* **10-minute episodes** — quick insight bursts while making coffee
* **20-minute sessions** — ideal for commutes or gym routines
* **40-minute deep dives** — for evenings of immersive exploration

This flexibility encourages consistency. According to a *University of Chicago Behavioral Science Lab* study (2023), people who can *self-set task duration* are **2.3 times more likely** to maintain habits long-term. BeFreed aligns with that principle, helping learners sustain growth without burnout.

Adaptive length personalization makes BeFreed uniquely suited for busy professionals and students aiming to integrate daily learning effortlessly.

### 2. Beyond Books: A 360° Knowledge Ecosystem

BeFreed curates insights from **multiple verified sources**, blending them into cohesive narratives. Each episode can integrate:

* **Best-selling nonfiction books** from sources like *New York Times* and *Amazon Charts*
* **Expert podcasts** from thought leaders such as *Huberman Lab*, *Modern Wisdom*, and *The Knowledge Project*
* **Academic research** summarized from peer-reviewed journals via *Google Scholar* and *JSTOR*
* **YouTube talks and interviews** distilled into structured lessons

For example, an episode on emotional intelligence might synthesize ideas from *Daniel Goleman’s Emotional Intelligence*, *Brené Brown’s TED Talks*, and *Harvard Business Review* case studies — creating a richer, more multidimensional understanding.

BeFreed turns scattered information into a connected learning experience, merging authoritative sources for genuine insight retention.

### 3. A Hyper-Personalized Roadmap for Growth

At the heart of BeFreed lies its **AI-driven learning roadmap**. The system continually learns from user behavior — topics explored, energy levels, even time of day — to build a roadmap that evolves dynamically.

For instance:

* A young professional might receive podcasts on *leadership and communication*, paired with flashcards reinforcing frameworks from *Dale Carnegie* and *Kim Scott*.
* A student might get *exam-oriented micro-courses* integrating key psychology concepts.
* A lifelong learner might blend *history and philosophy* sessions, followed by reflective journaling prompts.

This roadmap adapts weekly, ensuring that growth remains aligned with your current goals and cognitive load. *MIT Media Lab* studies (2024) suggest that adaptive learning paths can **improve comprehension by 35%** compared with static course formats.

BeFreed’s roadmap makes learning not only personal but *progressive* — continuously calibrated for your evolving curiosity.

### 4. Multi-Mode Learning for Every Brain

Different people absorb knowledge differently. That’s why BeFreed integrates multiple learning modes:

* **AI-generated podcasts** with customizable host voices
* **Readable summaries** for scanning key points
* **Immersive video explainers** for visual learners (especially history & biography)
* **Adaptive flashcards** for memory reinforcement

This design aligns with the *Dual Coding Theory* proposed by Paivio (1971), which shows that **combining auditory and visual cues** significantly boosts recall. Modern research by *Harvard Extension School (2024)* confirms that **multimodal learning** leads to **23% higher comprehension** than single-mode exposure.

By catering to auditory, visual, and textual preferences, BeFreed makes complex knowledge universally digestible — perfect for neurodivergent learners and multitasking professionals alike.

### 5. Smarter Internalization Through Cognitive Science

Absorbing information is only half the goal; retaining and applying it is what creates growth. BeFreed’s learning model integrates **evidence-based cognitive strategies** such as:

* **Spaced repetition** for long-term memory
* **Active recall** via interactive quizzes
* **Contextual association** that links new concepts to existing knowledge

I used to work in the same company and he was the Managing director. We met face to face only once, while both waiting for our coffee at the company's coffee shop. He didn't know who I am, but I did. We all knew him. Especially for his temper and strong personality. He would get very frustrated under pressure and very tough with underperforming departments. I was with a coworker and we both said hello, but he didn't answer. He had a very tensioned relationship with my boss. She wasn't good at her job, missed deadline and lied a lot. So when he and her ended up in the same meeting (I participated in just one meet with both of them there) everyone else was quiet because they kept arguing. I was a bit jealous she could step up to him.

I left the company and we met again randomly. He had been divorced for one year at the time. He had no idea who I was, only when I told him the department, he asked: ah you were under (my boss name). I was a bit starstruck tbh. He was older, held power, was confident and could offer me something I lacked my whole life: a mascuIline figure just the way I dreamed about. He could lead, he could take decisions under pressure. I felt proud of him. My dad was not like that. I was ashamed of him. Jobless all the time, relied on my mother, his parents, always needed someone to take care of him and had a drinking problem. When I was a kid I was so ashamed and would lie to other kids that he does have a job but cannot say what it is.

So, within a year we got married. I am 30, have two children, a toddler son and a baby daughter and my husbands want more. My issue is that he has the same temper at home too as he has at job. While things are going smoothly, he is nice, fun, but as soon as they don't, he is irritated, frustrated, raises his voice. He climbed the corporate ladder and he is now the General Manager, so he couldn't even go higher than this. But spends even more time either at the office or at the production plants. He has his assistant but he doesn't fully trust her because he has to see with his own eyes that everything is going as it should.

He comes home, eats, showers and sleeps. We are intimate maybe 3 times a month if he is in the mood. But usually too tired for it. When he is in a good mood he pulls me into his lap after I put our son to bed and then we spend 15-20 minutes talking and I rest my head on his shoulder or something. I love him but I am tired. I will also return to work in a few months. I work again at the same company as him, but at a low level position. So he didn't pull any strings for me. He said its better to work at the same place as I don't have a driving license and we can go and return home together. We go together, but usually a coworker drives me home because my husband returns at 7, 8 pm. Also, the coworkers I used to have a good relationship with, some years ago, now avoid me somehow",2,1759558624.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,10,0.75,False
