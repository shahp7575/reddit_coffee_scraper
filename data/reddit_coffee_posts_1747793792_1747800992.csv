My husband was left alone for two weeks, and I honestly wish he‚Äôd just joined a cult. At least then someone would‚Äôve taught him how to do laundry.

Two weeks ago, I flew to Colorado to visit my mom after her surgery. My husband‚ÄîGod bless him‚Äîsaid, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, babe, I got this.‚Äù He‚Äôs 42. I thought, surely, a man with a master‚Äôs degree can operate a washing machine.

He cannot.

Day 1: He texts me a photo of the laundry room floor covered in blue suds and says, ‚ÄúHey, is it normal for the washer to foam like a rabid dog?‚Äù He used dish soap. Dawn. A lot of it. The dog slipped and refused to enter the room for the rest of the week.

Day 3: He burns a frozen pizza. Not overcooks. Burns. Like blackened, charred, Pompeii-level destruction. Said he ‚Äúgot distracted organizing his fantasy football team.‚Äù Ate cereal for dinner instead. Every night after that, actually. Different flavors. ‚ÄúTo keep it exciting.‚Äù

Day 6: He attempts to vacuum, but the cord won‚Äôt reach past the hallway, so he ‚Äújust focused on the high-traffic zones‚Äù which apparently means one corner of the living room and part of the welcome mat. Everywhere else now has tumbleweeds of dog hair swirling like a Western film.

By Week 2, the man gave up entirely and began what he called his ‚Äúminimalist era.‚Äù He wore the same hoodie every day, claimed it was ‚Äúan experiment in routine simplicity.‚Äù The hoodie now smells like Fritos and sadness.

When I walked through the door last night, he was sitting cross-legged on the kitchen floor eating shredded cheese straight from the bag, watching a documentary about Roman aqueducts. The house smelled like Axe body spray and despair.

The cat has moved into the linen closet. The houseplants are‚Ä¶ not dead, exactly, but they‚Äôve entered their crunchy phase. My favorite mug is missing. I found it in the bathroom filled with what I can only describe as barbecue-flavored LaCroix.

This morning I told him I was going to Target. He asked if I could bring home socks, because all his are ‚Äúsomehow wet.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt know how. He just accepts it now.

So here I am, sipping iced coffee in the Target parking lot, mentally preparing to scrub two weeks of bachelor chaos out of my house. Love him dearly. But next time I leave town?

I‚Äôm hiring a babysitter. For my husband.

Exploring the vibrant culinary landscape of Lisbon presents food lovers with a delightful journey that doesn't have to lead to guilt. With a focus on healthier options and local ingredients, it is possible to enjoy the city‚Äôs rich flavors without compromising your well-being. Here‚Äôs a guide on what to eat in Lisbon without guilt.

Start your day with a pastel de nata made from whole-grain pastry. While traditional versions can be sugary, many bakeries now offer healthier alternatives using natural sweeteners or low-fat dairy. Pair this pastry with a cup of Portuguese coffee for an invigorating breakfast that won‚Äôt weigh you down.

For lunch, indulge in a bacalhau √† br√°s, a classic dish featuring shredded cod mixed with scrambled eggs, onions, and thin fries. Opt for a restaurant that uses olive oil rather than butter, and request a smaller portion to keep your meal light yet satisfying. Vegetarians can enjoy a hearty caldo verde, a traditional soup made with kale, potatoes, and chorizo, often found in various health-conscious restaurants.

When it comes to dinner, seek out dishes that showcase fresh seafood, such as grilled sardines or octopus salad. Both options are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and provide a nutritious way to experience Lisbon's gastronomic culture. Complement your meal with a side of seasonal vegetables for added nutrients.

For dessert, look for options utilizing fresh fruit or yogurt, such as a fruit salad or yogurt parfait, which allows you to enjoy a sweet treat without the guilt typically associated with more decadent confections.

In Lisbon, enjoying delicious food while maintaining a healthy lifestyle is entirely possible. With the multitude of lighter, nutritious options available, you can savor each moment without the weight of guilt.

1krota5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFIB/comments/1krota5/caffeine_and_tachycardia/,Caffeine and tachycardia,"I was diagnosed with AFib while in the hospital, and they cardioverted me. Had been on a major bender. Well, it's been close to 5 years, and no more episodes. I'm starting to think that it was Holliday Heart Disease, and what I see from my local city's subreddit, all the cardiologists in town have ""a degree that isn't worth the paper it's printed on"". The fact that everyone agrees on that makes me doubt the diagnosis, and my pulse tends to sit around 65, plus I'm too young to have AFIB. 

Anyways, I started drinking caffeine again. Usually just tea, sometimes coffee, but only when I need to stay up late to manipulate my sleep schedule. The problem is that with tea alone, my heart rate will jump up, just got 107 bpm, which, according to a PubMed study I found, said the goal with afib patients is to maintain a pulse under 110 bpm. I also quit drinking, and I'm eating a whole food-based diet, which includes stuff like whole wheat bread, even though it's far from my favorite. Thought about going full vegetarian except eating a 1 lbs steak once a month. 

My query is: should I be worried? Cut out the caffeine? Maybe get a script for the heart rate reducing drug I was on before I ran out and didn't bother to refill? I lucked out, and according to the [cha2ds2 test](https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/801/cha2ds2-vasc-score-atrial-fibrillation-stroke-risk), I don't need to be on a blood thinner.  Lucked out on that at least, because I'm super clumsy and would get nasty bruises walking into a wall absentmindedly. The cost of Eliquis is highway robbery, especially considering that the drug should/is off patent, even though the FDA approved the generics, I'm not exactly certain, except that it's a combination of litigation and patent.

1krosh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypersonaldevelopment/comments/1krosh8/how_to_create_great_opportunities/,How to create great opportunities?,"Opportunities rarely fall into our laps‚Äîthey are created through preparation, mindset, and strategic action. While luck plays a role, research from the University of California, Berkeley reveals that 87% of ""lucky"" people actively cultivate habits that attract opportunities.



So, how can you shift from waiting for chances to designing them? Here‚Äôs a science-backed, action-driven guide to becoming an opportunity magnet.

https://preview.redd.it/csoekejo722f1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63ca354bb603d2a7526497f32933fc6dd7d97b2b



1. Master the ""Preparation Principle""



Pianist Glenn Gould didn‚Äôt become a virtuoso by accident. He practiced Bach‚Äôs complex compositions until they were second nature‚Äîso when opportunities arose, he was ready.



How to apply this:

‚úîSkill Stacking: Combine 2-3 complementary skills (e.g., coding + storytelling = tech startup founder)

‚úîThe 20-Hour Rule: Learn just enough to be dangerous in new areas (Josh Kaufman‚Äôs research shows this builds baseline competence)

‚úîAnticipate Needs: Study trends in your field to spot gaps before others do



2. Adopt the ""Yes, And..."" Mindset



Improv artists live by this rule‚Äîaccepting what exists (""yes"") and building on it (""and""). Entrepreneur Sara Blakely used this approach when she turned $5,000 into Spanx‚Äôs billion-dollar empire by seeing pantyhose flaws as innovation opportunities.



Action Steps:

‚ûîReframe problems as ""How might we...?"" challenges

‚ûîSay ""yes"" to small risks (meeting new people, trying side projects)

‚ûîBuild on others‚Äô ideas instead of shooting them down



3. Engineer Serendipity



A MIT Human Dynamics Lab study found that 80% of breakthrough opportunities come from weak ties (acquaintances, not close friends).



Ways to design chance encounters:

‚úÖAttend interdisciplinary events (a chef meets a tech investor at a food-tech panel)

‚úÖPractice ""curiosity conversations""‚Äî15-minute chats with intriguing strangers

‚úÖUse the 5-Minute Favor Principle (help others without expecting returns)



4. Create ""Opportunity Showers""



Neuroscience confirms that writing down ideas daily increases pattern recognition. Composer John Cage kept an ""idea bank"" of random thoughts that later became groundbreaking musical techniques.



Try This Ritual:

1. Morning: Jot down 3 potential opportunities (no filtering)

2. Weekly: Review and connect dots

3. Monthly: Pursue 1 wild card (the most unexpected but intriguing idea)



5. Leverage the 10% Edge



Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps trained with goggles filled with water‚Äîpreparing for worst-case scenarios. This 10% extra effort created his unbeatable edge.



Your Turn:

‚úîGo slightly beyond expected effort (add 10 minutes of research to emails)

‚úîPrepare contingency ideas (if Plan A fails, have B and C ready)

‚úîDevelop signature strengths that make people seek YOU out



6. The Opportunity Amplifier: Strategic Visibility



Scientist Rosalind Franklin‚Äôs DNA research was groundbreaking‚Äîyet her lack of visibility initially cost her credit. Contrast this with architect Zaha Hadid, who strategically showcased bold designs before clients knew they wanted them.



Visibility Boosters:

‚û§Share process (not just results) on professional platforms

‚û§Teach what you know‚Äîworkshops attract opportunity-rich networks

‚û§Use the ""3√ó3 Rule"": 3 valuable posts weekly √ó 3 months = recognition



7. Turn Constraints into Creative Fuel



When chef Jos√© Andr√©s couldn‚Äôt open restaurants during COVID, he created World Central Kitchen‚Äîfeeding millions in disasters. Limitations often birth the best opportunities.



Constraint Techniques:

‚ñ∂""What If?"" Sessions: Brainstorm with artificial limits (e.g., ""What if we only had $100?"")

‚ñ∂Reverse Thinking: Instead of ""How to get promoted,"" ask ""How could I make my role indispensable?""

‚ñ∂Scarcity Mapping: List your unique resources (time, skills, connections) and recombine them



Become an Opportunity Architect



Great opportunities aren‚Äôt found‚Äîthey‚Äôre built through:

1. Preparation (so you‚Äôre ready when lightning strikes)

2. Connection (because opportunities flow through people)

3. Action (ideas unexecuted are hallucinations)



Start Today:

1. Identify one skill that would make you 10% more opportunity-ready

2. Have one ""curiosity coffee"" with an intriguing acquaintance this week

3. Write down three ""crazy"" ideas‚Äîthen make the most plausible one happen



As media theorist Marshall McLuhan observed: ""There are no passengers on spaceship Earth. We‚Äôre all crew."" The opportunities of tomorrow belong to those actively crafting them today.",1,1747800323.0,mypersonaldevelopment,0,1.0,False

My (26F) fianc√© (26M) sat me down yesterday and gave me a long talk about how he feels like I don't contribute enough to the household, particularly in the financial sense. I was a bit caught off guard by this, but was willing to hear him out, since he wasn't wrong. He makes a lot more than I do, and we've always split bills accordingly, which ends up being about 80% him. I asked what he wanted me to pay now, and he was adamant about it being 50/50.

I asked if everything was okay with his job, or if he needed to take fewer hours, and he wouldn't answer me. I honestly wouldn't have gotten upset if there seemed like an actual reason behind it, but he just said he'd been thinking about it a lot, over and over, every time I asked what brought him to this conclusion, what was going on, and eventually he just said ""this is how it's going to be, take it or leave it."" Those exact words, in response to literally everything I said. Full shutdown. No explanations.

I told him that was fine I'll take it, and then asked if he'd made a zillow account yet, or expected me to. He looked confused, and asked why we would need a zillow account. I explained that there's no way I can afford half rent on our current place, so we'll probably have to move into a one-bedroom apartment.

He got mad and asked why I didn't have savings. I told him that I do, but I'm not paying rent out of my savings, because that's a terrible and unsustainable idea. I also began to go over what our new food budget would be, our new entertainment budget, and that we'd probably have to sell the cars and get one less expensive one because I can't afford half of the payments on an Audi and a Land Rover.

Then I explained that date nights would probably have to be reduced too, and we could still do, like Buffalo Wild Wings or something, but I preferred Thursday nights because you get two orders of boneless wings for one. Basically, if he wants me to pay half, we're living within my means, not his anymore.

He kind of agreed to it, but since then, he's been incredibly angry. He's not saying or doing anything, but it's like he's walking around the house in this cloud of pissed-off. I sent him six zillow listings, all of which he's called uninhabitable for various reasons, some of which I think were valid, others I disagree with. He's now saying that I'm being unfair and manipulative, and that he tried to come to me with a serious concern about our relationship and I'm making it impossible for him to talk to me, and bulldozing over him.

AITA? 

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

**Relevant Comments** 

**Commenter 1:** Can I ask what your salary and his salary are? Like general numbers? A charitable take on his actions could be that he resents not having more money, and is trying to ""inspire"" you to try to up your salary or change into a more lucrative promotion/career so you can both be living the high life. He might be imaging how great it would be to have 200% of his income, instead of 120%. If that's the case, he's still going about it a shite and douchey way. Personally, I agree with many other comments re: someone has insinuated that you're a gold digger, and he was expecting you to break up with him, not problem-solve.

> **OOP:** I make around 35K a year. He makes around 120K a year.
> 
> It's not like there's some magical ""be rich suddenly"" button I can press. I'm a preschool teacher, and I don't have a college degree, and I certainly can't afford a college degree at this point without asking for help or taking out insane loans.

**Commenter 2:** NTA. To me, it sounds like something happened with his job and he's not able to tell you yet, for whatever reasons. I would try to have another calm chat about it with him, also showing him how much you'd be able to afford long term. Don't move forward with your plans of getting married until you both agree on your finances.

> **OOP:** I asked about the job, and he wouldn't give me a straight answer. The frustrating part is that I honestly do not mind downsizing, and if I found out tomorrow he lost a job, I'd literally be fine selling what we have and living in a trailer together off just my income, but this feels like some weird power play instead.

**Downvoted Commenter:** I get a feeling that his aim was to try and make you more ambitious, you need to equal him in ability to pay the bills, so you need to either get a promotion or a new job paying the same as him... So NTA, but your partner is a prick for not thinking things through and trying to strong arm you into doing something without discussing it first

> **OOP:** I don't know how I'd go about doing that, all things considered. It's not like there's some magical ""be rich suddenly"" button I can press. I'm a preschool teacher, and I don't have a college degree, and I certainly can't afford a college degree at this point without asking for help or taking out insane loans.

**Downvoted Commenter 2:** if you can barely afford your basic living expenses why the hell are you driving an audi (or range)? this is a classic example of lifestyle creep. if you barely make enough to contribute to rent, driving a luxury car is shameful. you‚Äôre NTA, you‚Äôre just a spoiled and unrealistic person

> **OOP:** He gave me the audi as a birthday present. It was not something I was aware of until it was in the driveway with a big pink bow and confetti. Literally like a car commercial. He's always had a bit of a flair for the dramatic.

**Commenter 3:** NTA. What podcasts does he listen to?*

> **OOP:** I don't know in detail. Joe Rogan I'm pretty sure, and ""Cumtown,"" and I think a guy called Sam Hyde. They're apparently funny. I don't super get that kind of humor.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/IXtZy7r87a): **August 26, 2023 (five days later)**

Hi everyone! This got way bigger than intended, so I figured a follow-up was owed.

So, last time I posted was Monday. Monday as a whole was spent just sorting through what I felt, and what to do next. There was a lot of silence and a lot of anger, and a LOT of reddit advice, some of which I found very insightful, some of which was less so. Also some people think I made this up as part of a viral marketing sponsorship between buffalo wild wings, audi, and zillow, which honestly would solve the money problems if true, but alas, is not the case.

On Tuesday, after I got home from work, I sort of just walked up to him on the elliptical and explained as calmly as I could that I had questions, and if he actually wanted to marry me, he needed to be willing to answer them. I asked if he thought I was a gold digger, yes or no. He said yes. I told him that I wasn't willing to be in a relationship where I have to prove myself by sacrificing any sort of stability, and that led to a bit of a screaming match, and eventually, a confession.

So it turns out we cannot afford anything we have right now. We are in serious credit card debt, the cars are both on the verge of being repossessed, and I did not know about any of this. He's been cutting corners on actual necessities, including psychiatric medication. That in combination with some comments from his family led him to some pretty dark places. My fianc√© had a full breakdown and apologized for calling me a gold digger, which was nice to hear, but this whole thing had me pretty shaken up. I went to stay with a friend for a little bit.

Yesterday, my fianc√© and I did in fact go out to BWW and get the two for one boneless. We talked, a lot. I'm still writing fianc√© for now, and I really hope we can work through all of this. We talked about how to sell the cars-- we don't particularly have a choice at this point-- and about my income, his income, and the sort of life we want to have. If we do stay together, we'll be changing how we live a lot. We need to get out of debt, we need to get on our feet. I know some people are gonna say I'm being dumb for not immediately dropping all contact and giving up on the relationship, but I can't do that. I can't look at the guy I love, who went off his meds to try and make a good life for me, and think he's not worth sticking around for, at least to try.

I don't know what the future looks like at all anymore though, and the wedding is very postponed at the moment. Sorry this wasn't a more fun update.

 **Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** OP, has he come clean to you about what got you guys so deep in the hole? For it to get to the brink it did, lifts more red flags in the air. He could be coping with an addiction problem, or something else that could destroy your life. You have got to figure this out ASAP. Please don't make any wedding plans; this is not the man you wanted to marry.*

> **OOP:** He has. It's not gambling or drugs, like a lot of people are saying. It's an addiction to nice things. He's got a lot of financial hangups, and comes from a family that replaced love with money, so he got it in his head that the only way to show love was to provide a very fancy sort of lifestyle, which was way over budget for us. It's going to be a hard pill to swallow, cutting back on everything, but it's what has to happen.

**Additional Comments from OOP**

> **OOP:** I didn't write everything out in this post, but we did go over how the debt got this bad, and I'm currently aware of pretty much everything. There are some accounts I still need to look at this weekend, but for the most part it's all above board at this point. We're definitely looking at the relationship, and I'm going to be taking a much more active role in life planning if we do continue.

+

> The wedding is on pause for an unknown amount of time. I'm already looking into places I can afford, and will probably end up renting a trailer. And no, I'm not lying for him. I told him point blank that hiding this stuff is what got us into this mess, and he's not going to be able to keep it under wraps if he wants to stay with me. We need to be up front about our financial situation, whether he's embarrassed or not.

+

> I think that with some hard work, we'll both end up in a better position. We need to get out of debt, and I'm taking the reins for a bit since he's never lived frugally before, but if all goes well, we'll get through this.

+

> I don't plan to leave if he sticks to what we're talking about and actually takes steps forward. I love this man, and I'll fight for what we have. If he won't fix things, won't listen, and continues to disrespect me, I'm gone, but I genuinely believe we will get through this. I know he can do better, and I believe he wants to. Now he has to prove it.

**Commenter 2:** Don't gloss over the comments from family. If you marry him, you're marrying them too. If they're generally toxic to his mental health, you need to talk about whether NC is necessary. If not, he has some serious repair work to do to fix the impression they have of you. Or has to take on the job of shielding you from their bs.

> **OOP:** His family don't like me for a number of reasons. They don't like that I don't have a college degree, they don't like that I grew up low-income or went to public school, and they don't approve at all of the fact that I'm religious. His mother in particular has called me a hick, a redneck, and several other things I won't put down here. Up until this point, though, he's been pretty good about defending me.

1. Pretty as fuck. This is the most physically attractive man I have ever met. Literal golden curls like a da Vinci painting, crystal blue eyes, just so pretty it gives me butterflies whenever he looks at me sometimes.

2. Best I've ever had in bed. Very good at just about anything, actually likes going down on me, and makes me see stars. I have never been in a relationship that was as sexually satisfying as this one, and there's no way I'm going back after this.

3. His voice is very sexy. Especially when he speaks Russian. He also speaks French, Spanish, and apparently Latin? But Russian is my favorite.

4. Got a vasectomy so I could go off birth control. He was the one to suggest it, because he saw how much I hated those stupid pills, and he was willing to get an actual surgery for me.

5. Full of little surprises and adventures. He's always doing things like getting me wildflowers, making my favorite breakfast before I wake up, or even planning little day adventures for us to go on together. Life is never mundane because he's always making it special.

6. Actually does housework. Does not need to be asked to do housework. He actually does more of the cleaning than I do, and I cook most of the meals, because he thinks that sweeping and mopping floors is ""meditative."" I do not know how I got this lucky on this one.

7. Plays guitar. Really, really well. It's very attractive.

8. Can physically pick me up and carry me around and does this often. I am not a small woman, to be clear. This is legitimately impressive and makes me feel so nice.

9. READS. I can actually talk about books!! With him!! You have no idea how rare this is, especially to find a guy who'll read anything I say ""oh I liked this."" You do not comprehend the feeling of mentioning offhandedly that you're reading Midnight Sun and having him come to you *the next day* after spending all night reading so that you could talk about it together until you live it.

10. Has shown me that there is actual romance in life and that I deserve more than a flat boring relationship devoid of orgasms or dancing in the rain or music. He brought real passion and fun and aliveness into my life, and in a world where that's treated as an unrealistic fantasy for most women, he's shown me that I deserve something unrealistic.

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/hA1qbLmlKn): **May 14, 2025 (more than 20 months later)**

We are out of debt.

It feels so, so good to say that and have it be true, but as of three days ago, everything is finally paid off and we've made our way back onto solid ground.

Almost two years ago, I made a post here about my (28F) fianc√© (28M) wanting to split things 50-50, and my offer of compromising on lifestyle changes. As it turned out, he was off his meds and had managed to get himself into some serious debt, a little under 100k, trying to provide a life that we could not afford on a combined 155k a year. Things were rough. I almost left him a few times. But we have finally, finally, finally made it through to the other side.

I handle the finances. 100% of the finances. I give him a budget for buying coffee. It wasn't fun, but in exchange he started doing more of the housework, so it evens out. We moved from our over-the-top apartment into a shared living situation, which, while not ideal, was leagues better than my initial plan of getting a trailer. We have roommates, but they're on another floor, so it's not too bad, and we have our own bathroom which was my only real stipulation. We've lived like we're a 70k a year couple, doing actual 50-50 finances, and every extra penny he's made has gone directly to paying off the debt.

We sold the cars, obviously. Traded them in for a nice used Ford Maverick and a Vespa. That helped a lot. There have been no more lavish vacations or over-the-top restaurants with $500 price tags. It was rough for my fianc√© at first. He's always been very much a rich boy, and I think losing that as an identity was difficult for him. That being said-- he's gotten \*so creative\* lately, it's been amazing to see. He will make me things if he can't buy me things, and we've started cooking together instead of having me do almost all of it. Our room is covered in the things he's made for me, and it's really lovely.

We're still in love. We're still going strong. And we can finally, finally, finally start actually planning our wedding again. We're gonna get our own place first, but the wedding is next on the list after that. I'm so glad that we stuck with this, and being on the other side is the greatest feeling in the world.

Thank you to everyone who offered advice. <3 I don't know how things would have ended up if I hadn't had the courage of my convictions, and I'm genuinely grateful to those who directed me to Dave Ramsey and Caleb Hammer. Y'all are awesome!!

TL;DR: WE MADE IT OUT AND ARE OFFICIALLY DEBT FREE!

**Relevant Comments**

**imherdpapley:** Huge congratulations to you for taking on that emotional as well as financial load. I'm so happy that he proved to be a solid partner to you in good times and bad. I love that you lasted through the hard times and reading that you are still in love with him (and vice vetsa) that's beautiful to hear!

I hope you have a fun wedding, cause you already have the marriage part down!

> **OOP: ** We're definitely going to have a fun wedding! We're gonna do a nice church ceremony, and a murder mystery reception! It's not going to be a huge thing, about 70 guests total, but it should be really fun.

**OOP on her relationship with his family**

> **OOP:** Oh, we don't get along but we're civil because we all love my fiance and we all want him to be happy. We will never do Sunday dinners as a family or anything, but they accept I'm good for him and have thanked me privately a few times for helping him out of debt.

1kroqzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1kroqzf/blackout_zone_5/,Blackout zone 5,"Honestly, when I mention this to people, no one else seems to remember this. I‚Äôm not sure why this seems to linger in my mind every night. When I mention the riots in ‚Äô93, they talk about the riots in LA.

They don‚Äôt remember the sirens screaming all night. They don‚Äôt remember the men in gas masks knocking on every door, telling us to leave. The shortages, the fear, the paranoia, the evacuations of entire cities‚Äîalmost the whole state.

I was one of the few who stayed. Some couldn‚Äôt leave for other reasons. Some chose not to leave. Sometimes, I would find their doors broken down and their bodies shredded like sheets of paper. As for me, I stayed because I had a new job to do.

They call us collectors. In reality, we just go off whatever names they give us. Some call us vultures. Usually, people are desperate enough or crazy enough to collect samples and intelligence from the quarantine zone for the eggheads or Uncle Sam. Some of us lived colorful lives. Some were given a choice: prison or being a collector. Some of us were contractors before this, or washed-up veterans, or ex-cops. As for me‚ÄîI had my own reasons.

They send us in by ourselves, or in pairs if they feel like we‚Äôre important. I wish I was that lucky, but then again, luck has never been my strong suit. When we‚Äôre not doing Washington‚Äôs dirty work, we‚Äôre holed up somewhere, licking our wounds in the cold. Some like to make their own little hideouts in the nooks and crannies. As for me, I always believed in safety in numbers‚Äîplus, they tend to attack groups of people less.

I tended to shack up in this big church. Some other collectors were there every now and again. Usually, it was just me, the pastor, and a few vagrants who had nowhere else to go‚Äîno one else to turn to. It was a nice spot, actually. The pastor always kept the fire going and had some beds set out in the main worship area.

It was like any other day in this hellhole of a state. I was sitting by the fireplace on a cushion with a cup of coffee cradled in my hands‚Äîinstant, of course. But hey, I take what I can get. Despite the coffee tasting like a combination of charcoal and gas, and the absence of sugar, I took another sip. I glanced over my shoulder to see a few people huddled in blankets, lit cigarettes hanging from their chapped lips. I glanced out the warped window and saw the snow was starting to pick up. Snowflakes began to gently tap the glass.

was just about to finish my coffee when I heard the distinct sound of my pager chiming. I groaned as I dug into my pocket and glanced down at the minuscule screen‚Äîa radio frequency to tune into. I gulped the last of my gritty coffee and tramped over to my bag for my SINCGARS radio. I set it up quickly: single channel, plain text, punched in the frequency. Then I grabbed the receiver.

‚ÄúScepter to Nest, radio check, over.‚Äù

The feminine voice of my handler chimed in from the other end of the net.

‚ÄúHearing you. Got some work for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúHit me.‚Äù

‚ÄúGot a hit from the Marines. They say there‚Äôs some unusual activity in the mall on Grover Street. They want a specialist to look into it.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes and let out a sigh. ‚ÄúCould they be more specific?‚Äù

There was a short pause before Nest finally responded.

‚ÄúSome of the grunts said they heard something coming from the old mall. Not sure how it‚Äôs possible.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, me neither. Well, I‚Äôll start hoofing it there.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, no need for that. There‚Äôs a convoy you can hitch a ride with to the mall.‚Äù

I furrowed my brow. ‚ÄúHow did you manage that?‚Äù

I heard a soft chuckle from the other end. ‚ÄúI have my ways. Get geared‚Äîthey‚Äôre gonna pick you up soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hear. Scepter, over and out.‚Äù

I hung up the receiver and gathered my gear. Of course, it wasn‚Äôt much‚Äîhalf of it was old surplus gear from Vietnam or stuff I managed to get from camping stores that hadn‚Äôt been completely looted. I finished putting on my MOPP suit, clipped my gas mask bag to my hip, grabbed my ALICE pack and my weapon case, and stepped outside as the sound of diesel engines rumbled closer.

I walked outside to see a six-vehicle convoy of weathered Humvees and five-ton trucks driving down the snow-covered street, a truck with a snow plow mounted on the front clearing the way. The line of vehicles came to a halt. A Marine in full MOPP gear waved over to me from a canvas-covered truck. I walked over as he leaned out the driver-side window to get a better look at me.

‚ÄúYou the collector?‚Äù he asked, the gas mask muffling his voice.

I nodded, and he thumbed behind him. ‚ÄúHop in, man. We‚Äôll drop you off on the way.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt waste any time and quickly threw my things into the back of the covered five-ton. I climbed into the shadowy interior. Half of the metal benches inside were occupied by the hunched-over shapes of Marines with combat loads, rifles slung over their chests. Arms crossed, some shivered in their MOPP gear. A few didn‚Äôt wear their gas masks‚Äîlit cigarettes hung from their lips. Stacks of framed ALICE packs filled the empty space across the benches. I settled into my icy seat as a few of the Marines gave me quiet grunts of acknowledgment.

The truck hissed before speeding off. There was little sound besides the rumble of the engines and the scent of burning diesel and cigarette smoke hitting my nostrils. I gazed out the back of the truck as the convoy passed half-buried wreckages of cars and the remains of what were once police checkpoints.

The uncomfortable silence was finally broken as one of the younger Marines turned to look at me‚Äîa question weighing heavy in his mind.

‚ÄúI gotta ask, why do you collectors do this shit? Ain‚Äôt most of you civvies?‚Äù

I snapped out of my trance and pivoted toward him. I offered a shrug. ‚ÄúMost of us are. But we all got our reasons. Just like all of you, I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre kind of forced to be here. You can just leave‚Ä¶ right?‚Äù he asked naively.

I quietly scoffed. ‚ÄúYou must be new around here. We can‚Äôt leave, even if we wanted to.‚Äù

That deflated his curiosity. His shoulders slumped, but he stayed quiet. The truck continued to rumble as it negotiated a large pothole‚Äîno doubt grown bigger from a year or more of nonexistent repairs.

The convoy stopped just shy of entering a semi-crowded parking lot. Some cars were still left. Many of the windows had already been smashed, the tires slashed, or missing entirely. Even with the snow, I could still see piles of scorched tires. Half-frozen corpses still buckled into their seats. Some clutched their loved ones, never letting go even after death. Others clutched icy weapons that could never save them.

An all-too-common sight nowadays‚Äîa constant reminder for those like me. Doomed to join the frost.

A multi-story behemoth of concrete and faded store logos jutted out over the horizon‚Äîthat was once a mall. Its numerous frosted-over windows hid its spiraling depths from view. I could feel the five-ton slowing to a stop as it let out another hiss before falling motionless. Without a word, I stood up from my seat, dropped my gear out of the truck, and hopped down with a grunt.

‚ÄúGood luck, collector,‚Äù one of the Marines said as I departed.

I took a deep breath, reached for the carrier bag on my hip, and pulled out my gas mask. I quickly donned it and pulled over the chemical hood, zipping it tight. The Marines only stared as their convoy sped away, leaving me to my own devices.

I reached for the receiver hanging on my bag strap and keyed in.

‚ÄúNest, I‚Äôm on site. Not seeing much yet. Looks pretty standard.‚Äù

‚ÄúStandard as in‚Ä¶?‚Äù she asked, waiting for me to elaborate.

‚ÄúNot seeing any shells. Still some bodies around. At least not any fresh ones. Gonna load up. Over.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you know the deal‚Äîtry to take lots of pictures and get a live feed if you can.‚Äù

‚ÄúGot it,‚Äù I said, hanging up my handset on the strap of my bag.

I kneeled down and keyed in the code for my case. With a soft click, it popped open. I grabbed my thirty-eight and my twelve-gauge. I loaded it up with double-aught buckshot, chambered a round, and walked toward the smashed front door.

The interior was dimly lit from the half-covered skylight. I could still make out the outlines of abandoned storefronts. Trash and debris dotted the floor. I stooped under the half-shattered door, boots crunching on glass.

‚ÄúMaking entry,‚Äù I whispered into my handset as I stepped inside.

A long hallway of looted storefronts and barred gates spiraled ahead of me.

‚ÄúCopy. Get me a live feed, Scepter,‚Äù Nest responded‚Äîher tone less carefree now.

I reached for the shoulder-mounted cam, switched it on, and set it to record.

‚ÄúLive feed up,‚Äù I replied as I slung my shotgun.

1kroq3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1kroq3d/profound_anemia_urgent/,"Profound anemia, URGENT","Hi Reddit, I‚Äôm asking for urgent help for my lab. Unfortunately we are running out of time with her. 

She is an 8 year old pure yellow lab (English). Spayed at 10 months old. Typical weight is around 80lbs. Up to date on all vaccines. Has been on hills science diet chicken formula due to chronic ear infections, which being on that formula helped. Occasional hot spots. Two swollen anal gland flares requiring antibiotics over the last 2-3 years. Juvenile onset cataracts (diagnosed by vet retinal specialist).

We noticed darker coffee ground emesis at the end of February, beginning of March. Was started on carafate and Prilosec with cerenia. Two week follow up with hemoglobin drop from 13.1 to 9.7. We took her to an emergency vet (did not repeat labs as was one day later) and they did an ultrasound finding non-specific thickening of the gastric mucosa and a single enlarged gastric lymph node. They recommended an endoscope with biopsy which would have been 3-5k. Our local vet called them and said she didn‚Äôt get a ton of information but didn‚Äôt get the sense that whatever was going on was favorable, likely cancer. In discussion with our vet we opted for conservative treatment and follow up labs in two weeks, and her follow up hemoglobin was stable. We also sent off a lab to California, a lymphoma panel (?) at VDI of sorts which  only showed a Lower albumin of 2.7, mag of 1.9 and an elevated TK1 of 9.6. The rest was all negative. She actually did well for a little while with decent appetite and no energy changes. Until a week ago. Unfortunately we had a huge storm and last power at our vet so got her in last night for recurrence of vomiting with an episode of dark, dark diarrhea (new). Follow up labs revealed a hemoglobin of 5.7. We are in trouble. I practice human medicine and don‚Äôt know what to do, but I know (and our vet said) we don‚Äôt have much time. For some reason I can‚Äôt attach and thus don‚Äôt have links to the labs I mentioned. We are well into 3k of care thus far and our vet wasn‚Äôt sure that in the end further diagnostics would change an outcome because the highest differential is a cancer of some kind. (This is a summary, our vet is wonderful). I don‚Äôt disagree but want to make sure I‚Äôm not missing something else. We have not done steroids yet. Just carafate, Prilosec, cerenia and a very bland diet during symptoms. Thank you all so much.

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/Q06pN42Bur): **May 10, 2024**

I (41M) have two kids with my ex wife, (42F) a son John(22) and daughter Sally (20), I'm remarried to my wife (28). I'm very close with my kids, my son is engaged to Abbie, she seems nice but has been a bit pushy trying to create relationships with me and my wife, though she's also awkward with her. Abbie isn't close to her family, she told us many stories why and while some of her complaints don't seem awful, it's not my place to judge and I didn't live it so I can't know anyway.

We've tried to be welcoming but Abbie has forced her way into some family traditions where she wouldn't have been invited, and some where no one outside of specific family would have. She has been calling Sally ""sis"" since they were only dating a few months, has an odd sister/mother-in-law thing she does with my wife, and the one I'm not a fan of, wants me to be like father to her. Not because we've clicked or anything. We are very different people, not saying that in a bad way, just saying it's not based on how we get along or anything.

My kids and I have a tradition when they come over that we have a private catch-up in my office/study before they leave, which is now even more important to them because while they both get along well with my wife they don't want to have personal conversations around her yet. Abbie asked if we could talk, and after I explained the tradition John later asked that I do it, saying she'd never had a caring conversation with her dad. 

We compromised that I didn't include her in the tradition but do join the two of them for coffee and let her talk. Then she started calling me dad, they werent even engaged yet, John pulled me aside and begged me to give her that, laid this whole thing on me about me always being the dad she always wanted right in front of her and she just wanted that, told me she cried watching me and Sally together (she still gives me random hugs, I'm a lucky dad). I didn't like it but I do feel bad so fine I gave her that. She wants me to walk her down the aisle and the father/daughter dance. I don't want to walk her down, and I walk with a cane so dancing is hard. At my own wedding I only danced twice. John is begging for me to do one, preferably the aisle.

They came over Sunday, John and I were talking, I thought to address it, when Ab walked in without knocking, asking if he'd told me yet. I asked what, John said she wanted me to say something about having a second daughter now in my speech and how I loved her. I just looked at him. She asked if I'd do the walk and dance for Sally, I said of course. She yelled she's my daughter too and I said it will never be the same, Sally is my actual daughter. I tried to explain I'd talk about her being a happy addition to the family and I love how happy she makes Jack, which i thought was a good compromise, but she started crying. John apologized and they left, but he called me when they were home nearly begging me to. AITA because I won't lie and say I love her or she's my daughter.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/cU032DTxqi): **June 26, 2024 (1.5 months later)**

I had planned on writing this sooner but life got in the way in a couple of really good ways, but people were helpful and asked for updates, and I have a surprise free day, so here it goes:

Mother's Day my kids and their partners go to visit my ex wife. So it turns out my ex wife and Abbie are a lot closer than I realized. She calls her mom, which is part of where this comes from. Also apparently my ex has been egging it on. On mother's day they were talking about the wedding and I guess whenever Abbie referred to me it was as dad. My son apparently told her let it go, which led to yelling. 

Abbie about deserving to be my daughter, ex telling her that she's right, son telling her that I am trying and she should be realistic about things, Sally telling her I only had one daughter - which was apparently a response to Abbie saying to her that as my ""daughters"" they should be united. according to my son Abbi was crying, according to Sally she was crying ang yelling and kicked something before going to her room, and Sally told me she went off on her mom, but will not elaborate so I don't know what was actually said. But knowing Sally - whoo boy.

Around 2am I got a text from Sally's partner's phone saying ""Abbie really is great, she hasn't been perfect but you should give her a chance and you will learn to love her."" I saw it when I woke up I tried to text her back but was blocked, so I called Sally but they were driving. They stopped by my place later that day because I am on the way and my daughter prefers my liquor and cooking and they told me about the night before. 

At the end I asked to speak to her partner alone, I asked if I had done something to upset her. She was confused and I told her I was blocked. She said I wasn't but checked her phone and I was, and I said it was after her message and she asked what message. I showed her, it was not on her phone anymore. At that point we brought in Sally and caught her up, neither of them were happy.

A couple of days later John and Abbie dropped by unannounced; not something we really do in this family but ok fine, I had mad salmon, does not take long to cook. I cook 2 more, wife serves while I make drinks. The entire night was Abbie trying to bring up the wedding, John trying to change the subject, Abbie not allowing that. 

We talk logistics because I am helping them get some good deals through some professional contacts I have when finally she just says ""so I was talking to mom, she said that you can walk me down the aisle and she'll do the dance, or you can dance and she'll walk, it's your call but you need to choose soon."" 

I reiterated that I could not dance (she tried arguing that I had danced a little at my wedding but I made it clear that is different) and did not feel comfortable walking her. She got upset and said ""mom loves me why can't you?"" I felt bad but couldn't lie, I pointed out that she had John who loved her, my exwife, friends, she had people who love her. She said ""but other than (ex-wife) those aren't my parents"" I said ""neither am I."" She was very emotional so my wife and I gave them a few minutes.

My son and I were alone later, he looked exhausted. He said the problem was that after Mother's day Abbie had called Sally and kept saying they are both my daughters, that I did not get to be close with one but not both, and that it was them against me - but at that one Sally cried havoc and let slip the dogs of war. Things were said. Grievances were aired. John had to hang up before it got worse, but I guess Abbie was shaken but there was a new problem; Abbie had decided in her head that I did not mean what I have been saying and was just doing it for Sally. He told me he would handle it.

Ron Howard: He did not

So now I get text messages from Abbie every couple of days acting like we have a secret relationship Sally doesn't know about, she even called herself my secret daughter and lol'ed. She invited my wife to lunch saying ""2 out of 3 of his girl's"" going out. She has even started using the pressure of showing up at events like a recent barbecue to play a certain image. She hugs me more and holds it, wants to do pictures with just me or my wife and I but always a few with just me to post with captions I do not like. 

My wife is getting especially annoyed because of how she is with her (I guess Abbie surprised her with father's day plans for me that had to be shut down, as it is she still inserted herself into the day) but she has a soft spot for her and when Abbie gets emotional she caves; my wife is a sweetheart.

I asked him if he is upset with me and he said no, he just wished it was different. He said we're good, but he's worried he and Sally aren't, which is when I took the advice of some people and suggested pre marital counseling, he said he would talk about it. Abbie is insisting Sally go to her fitting. 

That shop should pay-per-view that potential royal rumble because Sally is not holding her feelings back anymore. I told him Sally loves him and I'll talk to her, but for now it is stressful all around. Abbie driving my wife crazy with her ideas for what my ""girls"" should be doing, driving me crazy with dad-daughter content, drove sally to the edge, and oh yeah, last night sent me an email with 3 styles of father-daughter dances and song options, so i'm not feeling any more respected or heard than before. 

The six of us have barely been in the same room in order to let things calm down since father's day, which was great until it was a shit show. Sorry this is so long, with all the craziness this is still the abridged version. We are supposed to meet Friday, Sally's partner and I have a bet going about how bad it will go. So onward and upward, I hope you fathers had a less dramatic day than I did, and by any chance does anyone know exactly how bad of a crime I need to commit to enter witness protection? Just curious

&nbsp;

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/vY1O52Txmv): **October 2, 2024 (3.5 months later)**

I have gotten requests for updates on my situation, and as I enjoy a refreshing mojito and my wife her nojito, life feels good and the perfect time to amuse the world with my pain and familial drama! Plus a cousin of mine who apparently reads these and knows my situation gave me the convincing argument of ""dude, you can't keep people hanging"" and how can I argue with that airtight argument. I apologize for how long this is, a lot has happened.

My wife's pregnancy is going well, keeping her as stress-free and pampered as possible has been my focus. It is such a different experience this time, both because of how much more involved I can be and how much better a relationship I have with my wife than I had with my ex. My daughter Sally has been great, even her partner has been great, helping with the nursery or driving her around when I can't. My wife doesn't know because it is a surprise, but my son has been building a crib for the baby, modeled after the one I built for him and his sister, to show my wife his support. My son is a good man, and he is still in there, he just has a soft spot for Abbie. Which I guess gets us to the part of the movie where Godzilla shows up and starts busting up buildings...

So I called a family meeting with my kids to talk about the situation. Told John his sister was only doing wedding activities she wanted to and that the guilting requests needed to stop, that this was hurting his relationship with his sister. Sally was happy I said it so she did not have to yet again. I told him if he did not stop her from messaging me I would block her with a bluntly honest explanation why. We got a lot out, John seemed to understand but then a few days later they insisted on coming to talk. Sally and I decided we would get everything out. 

So all of us ate at our place, Abbie started in immediately about baby shower stuff and I told that is the kind of thing we wanted to talk about. I told her that I understood she has been trying to fill a hole that she has, that she thought she was getting a father, a second mother (she calls my ex-wife mom apparently) and a sister. I told her it was still possible but that she needed to start listening to us. I told her that for the sake of family we would give her a fresh start, if she agreed that moving forward she would respect our boundaries. My daughter did not love this idea but loves her brother and was willing to try. 

Abbie tried to say that since we were starting over we could define what the relationship would be and just be family, we told her we were not ready for that, that it needs to happen organically. She got mad that I am closer with my daughter's partner, which is true but we just get along, and that she deserved it for trying so hard. My daughter said something about trying things we actually want. She ran to our bathroom, he ran after her. After a while I checked on him, I could hear her repeating ""this is not what I wanted."" My wife, daughter, and her partner went out to the patio to give them privacy and salvage the night, after a bit I got a text saying they had just left.

I checked in with him the next day and he said they talked more at home and she understood. For a couple of weeks things were good. The texts stopped except the occasional wedding question, since it was getting closer. She stopped pushing herself on my wife and Sally, and we thought was involving us in less in wedding planning out of respect, since as it was they only got the venue at the rate they did because of my professional connections and they know I was willing to help but not interested in helping plan, even if I am good at event-planning. 

But then I got a call from the venue telling me the card I used had been declined. Now this is a specific card I use for big purchases because of the miles so I knew it had a high limit. That was how I learned that they had changed dates by two months despite being informed I would still be out much of the money because it was too close to the date. I was furious, I mean I have been lucky in life financially but I am not blow-off deposits like nothing wealthy. Called my son, said he needed to get his ass to the house, just him. They both came.

When they arrived I opened the door, she actually started with, ""Dad!"" I think I just replied ""you have got to be f'n kidding me"" and walked toward the table. Abbie had the nerve to ask where dinner was, my response was not polite as I made it clear that was not why they were here. I hoped my son would not lie to me so I asked what was going on with the venue. She started going into wedding details but my son interrupted to tell me they postponed because my ex-wife was unavailable because of a surgery and he had not told me because he was putting money together to pay the lost money himself, and he had just reached out to guests to let them know. And that is when Abbie's mouth opened...""we have extra time to work on our dance...""

Now during this time my wife came home, and i was walking her toward the bedroom when Abbie said that. My pregnant wife with me I said, calmly, ""I have different feelings about that and will elaborate further shortly"" or something like that. Then I laid my wife down and got her water, turned on her symphonic covers of popular songs and walked back to the table and said something like ""You are out of your f'n mind have you even been listening?!"" I made it clear I was done with this nonsense, we all were, and kind of lost it asking she did not hear us last time because her head was up her ass. She was stunned silent (what a beautiful sound) and looked at me while I, admittedly with little filter, explained what Sally and I thought of our time with her and her attempts to force us to love her without even getting to know us. She started crying and stood up and shouted ""then what was this even for?!"" 

John asked what she meant, if she meant them and he started to freak out. She was frantic and said she meant delaying the wedding. Because, and I'm pouring another drink to write this, it was a ploy! My ex-wife and her decided if I HAD MORE TIME I would come around. Apparently my ex told her not to worry about the money because ""I am loaded."" She has always been bitter I make so much more than I did when we were married, as if that is out of spite rather than my career arc. I think she did that on purpose, frankly.

But she not only told me that lie, she and my ex told John as well. He was distraught. Repeating ""you lied to me"" as she tried to spin it but he was letting it out about how much he has defended her and covered for her and she lied to him too. She was defensive and blamed my ex for telling her things and me for being stubborn, she yelled ""why can't I just f'n call him dad"" and, finally, after so long, I heard John respond ""because he is not your f'n dad!"" She started crying and something about his being the one that told she could call me that and he said he told her she might be able to eventually but he had told her again and again to slow down. She started sobbing and went to sit on her chair but missed and fell on the floor. Appreciating physical humor to break the tension I admittedly chuckled and hid my mouth behind my drink, this all led to a lot of sobbing. I said I needed to check on my wife and as I walked out she was repeating ""I just want him to be my dad too.""

I came out and he was walking her to the door and apologized, I said not too, they left. He came over a few days later and said they had a long talk at home, he even asked her if she would have dated him if there was never a chance of being in the family. He believed her when she said yes but she admitted I was a big draw as well. I was the kind of dad she always wanted, my relationship with Sally is what she always wanted, and the way she said it gave John doubts that she loves him for him. I talked about marriage counseling, how his mother and I tried it and, while it did not save us, it provided clarity and an impartial voice. I pointed out they both like coming to me, but I cannot be impartial and if they are trying then they need to do it for real.

Abbie texted asking if I was the one who suggested therapy, I responded with ""does it matter if John wants to?"" She asked why it is so bad she wants to know what I think and I just said john is the man whose opinion should matter most to her. They fought due to the text, she agreed to the counseling and the wedding has been postponed!! I may have done a dance. So they are in counseling, he said she struggles but I obviously do not know details. She is pressing for me and Sally to go to a session with her, Sally told her she did not want to hear Sally unfiltered, and I am not interested. Abbie has been leaving Sally alone, she stopped texting me except for the occasional general question which include some attempt to go deeper. My wife still occasionally spends time with her because she is very into her pregnancy, more so than I like but it is my wife's call. So that is where we are, sorry it was so long but alcohol makes for a poor editor.

[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/u/GreatestThrow-man/s/duDEjbeuXu): **November 20, 2024 (1.5 months later)**

I was told I should do updates here, people have been asking me to, and to get into what went down on father's day and at their mother's house, I have been extremely busy these last few months but am enjoying my temporary unemployment and thought of this account because of recent thanksgiving drama. I will do a an update and then will share what happened earlier. Oh, and to whomever made the joke that Abbie finally got me to dance, that made me laugh, I shared that with the family.

My time has been largely caring for my wife, I tend to dote, I know. We are having a boy! We are really excited, though neither of us really had gender preference. I have raised both and both experiences were wonderful. Now we are discussing names, who we are going to honor. I thought everything had been quiet, but recently found my wife crying and found out I was wrong. Given how busy I have been with work, and my wife knowing I would be free again once we got into this month, my wife has kept this to herself. Apparently Abbie has been pushing for one thanksgiving this year. Things have been quiet with Abbie, my son said the wedding blowing up woke her up, and that therapy had been helping. But then this.

My understanding is that while John has been talking less with his mother because of all that happened, Abbie did the opposite. From my wife's telling, Abbie dropped by one day with my ex wife. My wife intensely dislikes my ex wife because of lies she spread about my first marriage ending due to infidelity with her, despite their being no infidelity and the linear nature of time making it impossible for us to have slept together back then. Before anyone asks, my ex wife does not actually think there was infidelity, I would get into that, but I am sure I would sound biased.

Anyway so my wife looked at our camera app, saw who it was and called my daughter; apparently the two of them were keeping things from me because I was working 18 hour days and they did not want me dealing with anything else. I wish they had not done that, but I appreciate the thought. I am really lucky to have such caring people around me. My daughter called her mom and said something that made them leave in a hurry, she will not tell me what but she smiles when I ask. I called John but he was dealing with somehard work news, so I just was there for him and left the other alone. 

The next day Abbie came back, alone this time. My wife saw it was her and asked her what she wanted through the door, Abbie said to apologize. My wife let her in (she is too nice) and after a nice talk Abbie asked about the whole family getting together for thanksgiving, my wife said of course, she assumed as much. 

A couple of days later in our groupchat we were discussing details, who brings what, and Abbie asks what else is needed. I say John already committed and she asked what about my ex wife, what should she bring. In the time I have known Abbie she has never made an intentional joke that funny, so I asked what she was talking about and she mentioned the ""whole family"" comment, and my daughter and I both asked what made her think we counted her as family?? She actually replied ""she is my family. i don't have a dad who wants me, just a mom and my mom deserves to be with family on thanksgiving"" 

Sally replied ""well we'll miss you and John then."" Abbie asks how she can say that, Sally asks how she can be so stupid, John says not to call her stupid and I say that is fair but there is no real way she thought my wife thought she meant my ex wife(at this point my wife had filled me in). And then...this is so stupid...she uses my son's phone to add my ex frigging wife to the group chat. She then thanks us for the invitation and asks what she can bring! As I was typing my daughter beats me to it and asks what she thinks she is doing, she knows she is not welcome- but says it less politely. My wife types ""you could not have thought she was included when I said family."" Abbie responded that she was not coming as my family but as hers.

Sally let her mom have it, she already is not talking to her much and said if my exwife is there then she is not. I mentioned there was never a chance ex was going to come and said I understand Abbie and John wanting to go to their mom's house so she is not alone. John typed ""plans not definite, will let you know"" He has since told me that he is not going to go to his mom's place but wanted to tell Abbie alone first. All I can think about is the comment about not having a dad who wants her, because it means she is still thinking about me as a dad, I believe. Just a negligent one. I mentioned that to my son and he said he noticed it to and had brought it up at therapy, because family is such a frequent topic, though I obviously do not know details.

Wow I thought this would be brief but that was a lot, I will get into the crazy stories later if there are people seeing this who want me to. I do not know how posting from here works in terms of anyone seeing it, but this has been good to get out.

[Mini Update - I may have my boy back!](https://www.reddit.com/user/GreatestThrow-man/comments/1hdnte1/mini_update_i_may_have_my_boy_back/): **December 13, 2024 (almost one month later)**

I do not have time to elaborate right now but I am so excited I had to share this, Thanksgiving went so badly that my son called off the engagement itself and is now going to stay at our place while he figures out his next step! 

He came over Sunday night exhausted and asked if he could use the guest room and we talked for a couple of hours, I understand a bit more why he felt trapped now but he realizes if she does not see her issues then he cannot help her with them. I am taking him and his sister for a fun day on Saturday to just have some fun, he looks so tired and just needs some fun. 

Hopefully, while yes things are messy, he is moving in a better direction for himself. People here have been great and genuinely seemed to be rooting for him which I appreciate, so I just thought I would share the good news. Happy holidays, especially mine as he told her she was not invited!!

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I'm so glad you have your son back! But she's so delusional it may get worse before it gets better.

> **OOP:** I agree she will not be easy to disentangle from, I doubt she will let it be easy. We already have cameras outside in multiple spots, and Abbie does not have a key. I feel like we got my son back and Abbie got my ex-wife, I will take that deal in a heartbeat!

**Commenter 2:** I mean, I'm a long-time mental health professional, so I've seen some shit, thus I'm immediately picturing, upon your son officially ending it for good, her having a full on psychotic break and regressing into a child, throwing a full blown, kicking and screaming on the ground, shamelessly snotty and drooling no-fucks-given ugly-crying, DEFCON TODDLER level tantrum on the spot, screaming desperately for ""her"" Daddy, and raging at your son - not because he doesn't love her, or because he rejected her romantically, or any reason we would find realistic in our plane of what we consider ""logic"" - but rather accusing your son of taking ""her"" Daddy away and trying to keep HER AND YOU from being the family you were always meant to be.

Honestly, this type of crazy is so familiar to me, I could practically write the speech myself üôÉ.

BUT! This is NOT meant to be a prediction. This is just a worst-case-scenario type possibility, which is OBVIOUSLY what popped into my head, because, a.) Far too many years of personal experience in a professional capacity with ""worst-case-scenarios"" like this and even MORE crazy... and 2.) redditlol.

> **OOP:** He told me all about their conversation and how it confirmed to him he was making the right choice. It sounds like you are right about shouting and throwing things and said he was taking away her chance to have a family. There was a lot more, some I know, a lot I do not, but well done with your highly-educated guess, I cannot imagine the stories that you must have.

**OOP on how Thanksgiving turned out so badly**

> **OOP:** It was pretty bad, Abbie showed up with my ex wife despite the fact there was never a chance that woman would be allowed in my house. It got ugly from there and my son really let them both have it. He is done with his mom, both of my kids are, which after years of seething about lies she told about me but needing to hold it in around them, it is all out there now.

**Commenter 3:** Omg I have been waiting for your update, I hope your family and wife are all well. I'm sorry to hear about your son and I hope he heals, but he has done the right thing, he will find an amazing woman. I no its probably not going to happen but I hope the drama settles and I shall away your update with the dets

> **OOP:** That is why I came to post, some people have been really great on here and seem to be genuinely concerned, which I did not expect but felt meant I should catch people up. He is seeming like his old self, best gift for the holidays I could have asked for you know, but I know this will be a process for him. We will be here for him.

**Commenter 4:** His lucky to have such a great dad, you have been so smooth and chill through all of this, sounds like he has the support he needs to get thorugh this, I hope life gets better for him and you guys too

> **OOP:** Thank you, there were many times I wanted to be more assertive, but I worried that since he loves her and they were living together, which meant she could be in his ear constantly, that if I pushed it would either push him away or cause him to push back. It has been bad but while I know he has not given up on the relationship completely, he now knows she needs to show him she is working on herself or he is done. He moved a lot of clothes here, and when she messaged last week he asked her if she had been following through on something, and when she said no he was furious. He told me that he does not trust her and I asked him if there is can even be the foundation for a relationship without total trust and he said no. I think he is getting there!

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Update on life, sorry it is long](https://www.reddit.com/user/GreatestThrow-man/comments/1km4d11/update_on_life_sorry_it_is_long/): **May 14, 2025 (five months later)**

Life has been busy but great, but I have a lot of requests for an update, and people here have been really great so I figured that I should. To start, my wife and I have an adorable sleeping potato. He has made us both so happy; my wife, sleepy as she may be, is the happiest I have ever seen her. I had paternity leave and then various family took over helping my wife. My kids have been great about helping, my daughter has been having fun with her brother for the first time in a while. I am not going to provide details because my wife would not appreciate that, but I will just say that my wife had a scare late in her pregnancy which led to my kids really being there for her, and they pretty much have been since. They even got in my Mother's Day celebration for her. My wife loves it; she is really feeling the love.

My kids are doing great. Great news is that my daughter and her partner are engaged! They have a very specific idea of what they want to do, and I was asked to walk both of them down the aisle. That was too much for me, I am not a big crier, but I admit I contributed to the happy tears we had while all hugging. My daughter asked my son to be her best man (they are both having a best man and maid of honor) which makes me deeply happy, because I do not think he would have been her choice a year ago. They are definitely getting their relationship back to normal. My son had work issues because of federal cuts and had to change jobs but he is really happy where he is now. I used money I had saved for his wedding and bought him a getaway trip; with the job stress following the personal stress he dealt with, my kid needed time away. No Abbie, no job stress, no family (I think we are pretty great, but we spend a lot of time together and I figured he might need a week away from us too). It was not easy separating from Abbie, she and his mother made it difficult for him. My ex-wife tried seeing him through Abbie, and my son was having none of it, especially after a public tantrum at his old job (it was a public-facing position with his office info online) that really embarrassed him. She would not dare do that to Sally. Neither of my kids have anything to do with her. Abbie made a couple of dramatic attempts to get my son back, but my son was clear with her. She has been out of his life and he is visibly relaxed. He is living in a new place, close to his new job. He even mentioned putting himself out there a little while ago.

A couple of months ago a young woman joined our shop, she is very personable, funny and attractive. Our work includes receptions and work socializing, so I have gotten to know her a little, she seems fun. She has mentioned dating and being single a couple of times when we have talked, so I asked my son if he would be okay to give her his number if she was interested, and he was. They have gone out a couple of times, it does not sound like a great fit, but when he was talking about how attractive she was I could see he was enjoying meeting new women again, which frankly all I really hoped for. It got him excited to go out again and got him some confidence back, so whatever happens it was successful as far as I am concerned.

So, things are really good. And there is going to be a wedding! I have been helping plan it, their ideas of course. It feels like we have gotten through something together, now I am over here shepping nachas, just overflowing with joy. Our little one, eventually an upcoming wedding, and my son smiling consistently again. I really appreciate all of you wonderful people and all of your good advice and well-wishing. Life is so much easier now, babies require time but they are drama free!

**Additional Information from OOP after a comment request regarding Thanksgiving in an older post**

> **OOP:** For Thanksgiving it was my wife and I, Sally and her partner, a couple of friends of my kids who do not have much family and were basically adopted when they were all teens, and John. He just wanted quiet and thought Abbie and his mother were eating with her group. 
> 
> About an hour into it the doorbell started ringing emphatically. I looked through the peephole, my ex wife and Abbie were standing there, Abbie had a half pan of macaroni and cheese and my ex-wife, for some reason, had a bag from fast food, but was holding it like it was her contribution. I called for my son and told him to deal with them, he opened the door and his momsaid hello so pleasantly and tried to walk past him but he stopped her. 
> 
> Abbie said the entire family needed to be together and my son just told her to stop it, and asked for a minute with them, so I went inside and told everyone, rightly worried about how Sally would react. She got up and marched toward the door, opened it and just unloaded. Her partner was right behind her, but was pulling up video on her phone. It was something like ""what the hell is wrong with you crazy manipulative..."" and just...years worth of held in anger was projectile vomited over my ex-wife and Abbie, and then ex-wife again. 
> 
> My ex-wife got so mad she yelled ""SHUT UP"" grabbed the pyrex that the mac n cheese was in and threw it down, I assume it expecting it to shatter. It just...THUD...and was intact though cracked it looked like. Everyone was silent and she just picked it up, I admit I laughed at that so I stepped in. My laughing started to set my ex-wife off but my son jumped in, not yelling, but firm. He told her did not know if he wanted anything to do with her anymore but if she did not backoff the answer was no for sure. He looked at Abbie and asked her why she keeps doing this, how it has not gotten through her head. With that he said, ""what is wrong with you, I really am asking?""

I know it was petty, but I said ""hold on, I do want to help"" so I went to the kitchen, got a spoon and went back, and stuck in in the macaroni and cheese and told her that way she could eat while she ate. My kids laughed so I sent them in so it would not escalate even more and I stepped outside and shut the door behind me, and made it very clear that she was not to come back and said some other select words. She was clearly about to yell so I pointed out it was a quiet neighborhood and that would likely get the police called. She stomped away and I have not seen her since.

I (28M) and my recent fianc√© (Dana 25F) have been together for about 5 years. We currently live separately at home to save up for our own place, financial struggles in our careers. We are in the same career field. Her family comes from money for being in that field for generations, and I am the first one in my family.

When I first met Dana's parents (John and Martha), they seemed like okay people. John had the typical ""chip on the shoulder"" type due to the career path, but didn't seem too bad. And Martha was just the average stay at home mother. But I could start to see John in a different light as time went on... John would always tell us how ""being in a relationship is a terrible idea"". And ""Everyone cheats in this career, so why bother"". Almost the whole time we have been together, John and a few of his friends always said things like that to us, especially to Dana.

At one point in time, I found out from a co-worker in my field, that John had cheated on his wife a couple times. It wasn't any of my business, so I never brought it up to Dana... Until one day she was having a really rough time with the comments being said to her about relationships. She explained everything to me. (I can't explain the details, but think of the most messed up way someone could cheat on a spouse, be caught doing it, that could easily destroy entire families). John is a habitual liar.

**Main Part**

Fast forward a few months, I go and pick Dana up for our day. I walk into the house, there is Dana, John, and one of John's retired friends. The friend was in the middle of telling a story about how a woman got a divorce, married a rich guy to get more money, then went back to the first man. He explained ""that's what you guys should do"". I just sat there visibly not paying attention, and starting to get upset and tired of hearing it. Then John had one of his, what I call ""childish breakdowns"", and told me to pay attention to the story. I refused and said I'll wait in the car, and I stormed out. John then came out and said to walk and talk. So, we did. The very first thing I told him, was that we are both sick of people telling us our relationship won't work, and how I am extremely disappointed how it's mostly coming from her own father. John told me it's all ""coffee house"" jokes. To which I replied, ""Not when it's hurting your own daughter this much"". Most of the talk, I was well mannered and respectful, while he puffed his chest and rambled on about random things, how he worked hard for his career.

I ended the conversation early because it was useless reasoning with the guy. John waited until he got to the front door, opened it, and yelled across the driveway ""Leave and never come back"". As if he meant for everyone inside to hear... Dana and I leave. We just talked in the car for a few hours about it.

The next day Dana asked for me to call and apologize. So I gulp my pride and do that. I apologized for my mannerisms, but not on what I said. John then proceeds to lecture me on finding other women. And to read women's books to learn how they work. I obviously will not take that advise. 

It has been six months now. John convinced his wife to hate me, telling her lies about things I said. Every time Dana and I have our days together, her parents tell her how she's going to end up in a basement. Every getting more and more cruel. How they disown her for being with me. (I am literally the least intimidating, levelheaded person, and I have no idea where they get these ideas). We have well set plans to get our own place here soon. The best I can do is tell her to not listen to them.",1,1747799689.0,AITAH,3,0.67,False

Going on 5 years on the waitlist for a Submariner date. Starting to lose hope.

In the beginning I thought, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just walk in, be polite, maybe toss around a few phrases like ‚Äòtimeless design‚Äô and ‚Äòinvestment piece,‚Äô and boom ‚Äî a Rolex is mine.‚Äù Instead, I was greeted by a sales rep ‚ÄúTodd‚Äù

Todd was a dick from day 1

So, I began the transformation. I bought a Tudor. Then another. Then a third one that I didn‚Äôt even like. I said things like ‚Äúunderrated value prop‚Äù and ‚Äústealth wealth‚Äù until I started to believe it myself. I bought a Montblanc pen, two pairs of Cartier cufflinks (I don‚Äôt even wear French cuffs), and some sort of leather valet tray that has never held anything but my growing shame.

Still, no Rolex.

Next, I tried the ‚Äúhuman connection‚Äù angle. I started bringing in coffee for Todd and the rest of the staff. At first, it was just a couple of lattes. I started bringing in charcuterie boards. I mean full boards ‚Äî imported salami, triple cr√®me brie, figs, olives. ‚ÄúJust thought you guys might need a little snack today!‚Äù 

Still, no Rolex.

Then came the worst phase: performative sports enthusiasm. I don‚Äôt play golf. I don‚Äôt like golf. I once mistook a putter for a meat tenderizer. But Todd likes golf. So I started showing up at the store in golf polos, talking about my ‚Äúhandicap‚Äù (which I think means something entirely different than I used it for). I even offered to take Todd golfing ‚Äî at a course I had to pay a full non-member fee just to step foot on.

He declined.

Football was next. I created an entire backstory about being a lifelong fan of a team I literally Googled the night before. I memorized stats. I subscribed to newsletters. I made memes. I invited Todd to my ‚ÄúSunday night football BBQ‚Äù which, spoiler alert, was just me grilling alone with a cooler full of IPAs I hoped he might like if he showed up. He didn‚Äôt.

Still. No. Rolex.

What am I doing wrong? Should I buy another Tudor?? Should I try to take Todd golfing again?

I'd rather our baby gets all the love. 
    Ever since he has been impossible. He gaslights me very badly. Has neglectfully put us in danger. He very recently has borderline threatened me. 
    After we were married, he became extremely insecure. I found out I was pregnant right away which made him care about me less. My health and well-being he cared about because it determined the babies well-being. Even that though, I was not pampered at all. My morning sickness was awful. I had damage from the puking and acid reflux. He got me food at a weird time once. He made coffee and smoked in our house after I asked him not too and I told him strong smells made me puke. It literally woke me from my sleep to puke. It's almost as if he didn't believe me. 
    He convinced me to not buy things for myself. To not buy clothes when I got bigger, not buy things to take care of myself. Things got worse after I had a baby so I won't get into that.

    I'm tired. I don't want life to get harder. I really don't want my child's quality of life to go down either. I would do anything for my child and I will only do what I think is best. Unfortunately, I feel like this is best in a lot of ways but it's also so bad in a few critical ways.

Abstract:
This guide presents a practical and research-backed synthesis of modern metabolic science, ancestral wisdom, and strategic food timing‚Äîcrafted as a form of ‚Äúdietary witchcraft‚Äù for those seeking to master their energy, mood, and cognition through grocery store ingredients. Unlike restrictive diets or trend-based plans, this field-based approach emphasizes targeted food actions‚Äîactivating metabolic pathways like AMPK, mTOR, and autophagy via timing, synergy, and symbolic ingestion. Core to the method is the understanding that food is not just fuel, but signal: each bite communicates instructions to the body‚Äôs biological rhythms. By treating food as spellwork‚Äîinputs with systemic effect‚Äîthis guide empowers metabolic coherence, fat adaptation, neuroplasticity, and sustained energetic clarity.

‚∏ª

1. Introduction: Food as Spell, Body as Alchemy

What if your kitchen were a temple, your grocery list a spellbook, and every bite you took a ritual of transformation? Not metaphor, but mechanism.

This is the central premise of metabolic witchcraft: the idea that the human body is not merely a passive consumer of calories, but an intelligent, programmable biochemical field. In this view, metabolism is not just a furnace‚Äîit‚Äôs a language interpreter. What you eat, when you eat, and how you combine foods are commands written into the metabolic operating system. These commands activate or inhibit genes, shape hormonal responses, regulate circadian biology, and determine energy allocation across systems.

Modern nutritional science has begun to map this terrain with increasing precision. For example:

	‚Ä¢	Curcumin in turmeric modulates inflammatory signaling through NF-Œ∫B inhibition„ÄêShehzad et al., 2013„Äë.

	‚Ä¢	Catechins in green tea stimulate AMPK activation, enhancing fat oxidation and mitochondrial efficiency„ÄêHursel et al., 2011„Äë.

	‚Ä¢	Sulforaphane, found in broccoli sprouts, induces Nrf2 pathway activation, enhancing detoxification and cellular defense„ÄêKensler et al., 2013„Äë.

These are not passive effects‚Äîthey are biochemical spells. They are real-time interactions between symbol (food) and field (body). To eat with knowledge is to cast influence over one‚Äôs biology. This is what ancient herbalists, mystics, and monks always knew: that certain ingredients, taken with timing and intention, produce more than nutrition‚Äîthey produce transformation.

The modern frame often strips food of its agency, reducing it to macronutrients and numbers. But this is a low-resolution map of a multidimensional territory. ‚ÄúCalories in, calories out‚Äù is not false‚Äîit‚Äôs just radically incomplete. A calorie of sugar at midnight is not the same as a calorie of fermented cabbage at dawn. Context is king. Timing is code. Synergy is spellcraft.

From the esoteric kitchens of folk herbalists to the biolabs of Silicon Valley biohackers, a new synthesis is emerging. What unites them is this: the recognition that food is a vector of influence, and that the body‚Äîfar from fixed‚Äîis fluid, reactive, and profoundly responsive to symbolic input.

In this guide, ‚Äúwitchcraft‚Äù is reframed not as superstition but as systemic influence via ordinary acts. We will explore specific, accessible foods‚Äîfound in any supermarket‚Äîthat can tune metabolism, support hormonal balance, enhance energy, and influence cellular expression. You won‚Äôt find fad diets here. You‚Äôll find metabolic rituals: precise, practical, and potent.

Because every bite you take is not just a choice. It‚Äôs a spell.

And your body?
It‚Äôs the altar.

‚∏ª

2. Metabolic Signaling Systems

To biohack your metabolism effectively‚Äîlike a modern-day dietary witch‚Äîyou must understand the spellbook of your cells. And that means decoding the body‚Äôs core metabolic signaling systems: the invisible programs that determine whether you store fat or burn it, regenerate or degrade, repair or grow old. Chief among these are the mTOR, AMPK, and SIRT1 pathways‚Äîeach functioning like a biochemical gatekeeper, deciding how your body allocates energy.

‚∏ª

mTOR: The Builder

mTOR (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin) is the master switch for growth and synthesis. When mTOR is activated, your body enters an anabolic state‚Äîit builds muscle, synthesizes proteins, and stores nutrients. This is essential for recovery and development, but if constantly activated (via constant eating, high protein intake, and insulin spikes), it accelerates aging and increases disease risk.

	‚Ä¢	Foods that activate mTOR: leucine-rich proteins (e.g., whey, eggs, chicken), insulinogenic carbs.

	‚Ä¢	Best used: post-workout or in refeed cycles‚Äîa spell to build, not to sustain.

‚∏ª

AMPK: The Burner

AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is the energy sensor of the cell. When nutrients are low, AMPK activates fat oxidation, mitochondrial renewal, and cellular cleanup (autophagy). It is the fasting-state guardian, the metabolic signal that says: ‚ÄúBurn the stores. Clean house.‚Äù

	‚Ä¢	Foods and habits that activate AMPK:

	‚Ä¢	Green tea (EGCG), coffee (polyphenols)

	‚Ä¢	Fasting and cold exposure

	‚Ä¢	Vinegar (acetic acid), turmeric (curcumin)

	‚Ä¢	Best used: early in the day or during fasted states‚Äîto signal burn mode, improve insulin sensitivity, and support longevity„ÄêMattson, 2019„Äë.

‚∏ª

SIRT1: The Preserver

Sirtuins (especially SIRT1) are longevity proteins that regulate DNA repair, inflammation, and mitochondrial efficiency. Activated by calorie restriction and certain polyphenols, SIRT1 is the metabolic oracle‚Äîguarding the genomic spellbook from entropy.

	‚Ä¢	Foods that activate SIRT1:

	‚Ä¢	Resveratrol (red grapes, blueberries)

	‚Ä¢	Oleuropein (extra virgin olive oil)

	‚Ä¢	Quercetin (onions, capers, green tea)

	‚Ä¢	Best used: in conjunction with fasting, polyphenol-rich meals, or post-stress recovery‚Äîthey amplify the repair phase initiated by AMPK„ÄêSinclair et al., 2020„Äë.

‚∏ª

Hormonal Rhythms: Insulin & Leptin

	‚Ä¢	Insulin is the nutrient gatekeeper. High insulin = store mode. Low insulin = burn mode. To control insulin is to control energy destiny.

	‚Ä¢	Leptin is the long-term fuel gauge, regulating appetite and metabolic rate. Leptin sensitivity is reset through fasting, light exposure, and sleep.

Circadian Entrancement

Meal timing is a major controller of circadian biology. According to Panda and Longo‚Äôs work (2016), time-restricted feeding (eating within a 6‚Äì10 hour daylight window) improves sleep, weight, insulin, and mitochondrial health. Light in the morning + food at the right time = hormonal harmony.

‚∏ª

In sum:

	‚Ä¢	mTOR builds.
	‚Ä¢	AMPK burns.
	‚Ä¢	SIRT1 preserves.

Your food, your schedule, your light exposure‚Äîthey all speak to these systems. The modern metabolic witch knows how to speak that language.

‚∏ª

3. Foods That Trigger Specific Metabolic Effects

A. Fat-Burning (AMPK Activators)

To unlock the body‚Äôs internal ‚Äúburn‚Äù mode, we target AMPK, the cellular energy switch that gets flipped on during times of nutrient scarcity, fasting, or strategic stimulus. By choosing foods that activate this pathway, especially during the morning or fasted state, you prime your body to oxidize fat, stabilize insulin, and repair mitochondrial function.

‚∏ª

1. Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)

‚∏ª

Optimal Timing:

Midday or post-mental exertion ‚Äî when the brain enters a receptive state for repair and signal integration.

‚∏ª

These foods act like spell components for your mitochondria and mind‚Äîcarefully timed inputs that awaken cellular intelligence, sharpen focus, and rebuild the architecture of thought. Fuel the system not just for energy‚Äîbut for insight.

C. Protein Synthesis and Growth (mTOR Triggers)

This category supports muscle repair, cellular rebuilding, and tissue regeneration through activation of mTOR (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin)‚Äîa master growth regulator. These foods are rich in amino acids, particularly leucine, which serves as a biochemical ‚Äúon switch‚Äù for anabolic activity.

‚∏ª

1. Grass-Fed Beef or Pasture-Raised Eggs

	‚Ä¢	Use: 4‚Äì6 oz beef or 2‚Äì3 eggs, post-workout or midday

	‚Ä¢	Function: High in leucine, creatine, heme iron, and B vitamins

	‚Ä¢	Mechanism: Triggers mTOR pathway, stimulating protein synthesis and muscle repair

	‚Ä¢	Why grass-fed: Better omega-3:6 ratio, more CLA (conjugated linoleic acid), fewer inflammatory residues

‚∏ª

2. Bone Broth

	‚Ä¢	Use: 1‚Äì2 cups, evening or rest day

	‚Ä¢	Function: Supplies glycine, proline, collagen peptides

	‚Ä¢	Mechanism: Supports connective tissue repair, gut lining integrity, and sleep quality

	‚Ä¢	Optional hack: Add turmeric or black pepper for enhanced absorption and anti-inflammatory synergy

‚∏ª

3. Fermented Dairy (Kefir, Greek Yogurt)

	‚Ä¢	Use: ¬Ω‚Äì1 cup, morning or post-exercise

	‚Ä¢	Function: Delivers complete protein + probiotics for digestion and gut-brain signaling

	‚Ä¢	Mechanism: Activates mTOR while enhancing microbiome resilience, which indirectly regulates insulin and metabolism

	‚Ä¢	Note: Full-fat versions increase satiety and support fat-soluble vitamin absorption

‚∏ª

4. Quinoa + Legumes (e.g., lentils, chickpeas)

	‚Ä¢	Use: 1 cup cooked combo, midday or after physical effort

	‚Ä¢	Function: Offers a complete amino acid profile for vegetarians/vegans

	‚Ä¢	Mechanism: Sufficient methionine and lysine ratios to trigger mTOR when combined; also rich in fiber, supporting stable insulin curves

	‚Ä¢	Enhance with: EVOO, lemon, and herbs to improve absorption and flavor

‚∏ª

Best Time to Eat:

Post-workout, during growth or repair phases, or early/midday feeding windows when insulin sensitivity is higher.
Avoid late evening, as mTOR activation close to bedtime can impair autophagy and disrupt metabolic recovery cycles.

‚∏ª

Summary:

These foods don‚Äôt just feed you‚Äîthey instruct your body to build. Think of them as metabolic builders that, when timed well, help encode strength, repair, and growth into your cellular architecture. Use them when it‚Äôs time to rebuild the temple.

D. Liver Detox and Hormonal Reset

The liver is not just a detox organ‚Äîit‚Äôs a metabolic command center that regulates hormones, glucose, and fat metabolism. Targeting liver support through specific foods helps reset circadian metabolism, reduce hormonal congestion (especially estrogen excess), and enhance whole-body energy flow. These foods act as gentle, natural ‚Äúcodes‚Äù for liver activation and hormonal recalibration.

‚∏ª

1. Cruciferous Vegetables (Broccoli, Kale, Arugula, Brussels Sprouts)

	‚Ä¢	Use: Lightly steamed or raw in salads, afternoon or dinner

	‚Ä¢	Function: Rich in sulforaphane, indole-3-carbinol, and glucosinolates

	‚Ä¢	Mechanism: Promotes phase I & II liver detox, helps clear excess estrogens, supports gut-liver hormone loop

	‚Ä¢	Tip: Add lemon or apple cider vinegar to enhance enzyme release and flavor

‚∏ª

2. Beets

	‚Ä¢	Use: Roasted, grated raw, or juiced (¬Ω‚Äì1 cup), late afternoon

	‚Ä¢	Function: Contains betaine, nitrates, and betalains

	‚Ä¢	Mechanism: Supports methylation, enhances bile production, improves liver blood flow

	‚Ä¢	Bonus: Increases nitric oxide ‚Üí better oxygen delivery to tissues

‚∏ª

3. Ginger + Lemon Tea

	‚Ä¢	Function: Gingerol stimulates digestion; lemon aids bile secretion

	‚Ä¢	Mechanism: Activates gastric motility and liver enzyme flow, easing metabolic load after heavy meals

	‚Ä¢	Add-on: Dash of cayenne for circulatory kick if tolerated

‚∏ª

4. Dandelion Root (Tea or Tincture)

	‚Ä¢	Use: 1 cup tea or 30 drops tincture, early evening

	‚Ä¢	Function: Classic bitter tonic for liver and gallbladder function

	‚Ä¢	Mechanism: Enhances bile drainage, clears metabolic byproducts, supports hormonal detoxification pathways

	‚Ä¢	Caution: Check for allergies or bile duct issues before consistent use

‚∏ª

Best Time to Eat/Drink:

Afternoon to early evening, when digestion slows and liver metabolic cycling begins to ramp up. These foods support a non-stimulant ‚Äúsecond wind‚Äù by promoting detox, easing hormonal traffic, and preparing the body for clean sleep-phase metabolism.

‚∏ª

Summary:

These are your alchemy roots‚Äînot flashy, but foundational. They help your body filter the chaos, rebalance hormones, and drain the noise that builds from environmental and internal stress. When you eat these, you‚Äôre not just cleaning house‚Äîyou‚Äôre tuning the whole system.

E. Longevity and Autophagy Promoters

Autophagy is your body‚Äôs internal clean-up mode‚Äîrecycling damaged cells, clearing waste, and regenerating tissue. Certain foods enhance this process without breaking it, especially during low-insulin windows or fasting-mimicking states. These aren‚Äôt high-calorie meals, but signal foods‚Äîsmall, targeted inputs that keep the system in deep maintenance mode while gently supporting energy.

‚∏ª

1. MCT Oil / Coconut Oil

	‚Ä¢	Use: 1 tsp to 1 tbsp in tea, coffee, or broth ‚Äî morning or midday (fasted state)

	‚Ä¢	Function: Rapidly converts to ketones, bypasses insulin pathways

	‚Ä¢	Mechanism: Fuels brain and muscle without spiking blood sugar; promotes autophagy-compatible energy

	‚Ä¢	Tip: Pair with herbal tea or black coffee for an energy-boosting fast extension

‚∏ª

2. Garlic (Raw or Lightly Minced)

	‚Ä¢	Use: Minced into warm meals, broth, or taken raw with honey or olive oil ‚Äî evening

	‚Ä¢	Function: Activates autophagy, has potent immune-regulating sulfur compounds

	‚Ä¢	Mechanism: Stimulates cellular cleanup, mitochondrial repair, and acts as a broad-spectrum anti-pathogen

	‚Ä¢	Caution: Strong raw‚Äîuse small amounts unless accustomed

‚∏ª

3. Green Olives (Raw or Brined)

	‚Ä¢	Use: 4‚Äì6 olives as a snack or side ‚Äî midday or fast-breaking window

	‚Ä¢	Function: High in oleuropein, a polyphenol linked to cellular repair and anti-aging

	‚Ä¢	Mechanism: Low-glycemic fat source that supports fasting without disrupting it, primes digestive bile flow

	‚Ä¢	Bonus: Also enhances absorption of fat-soluble antioxidants (A, D, E, K)

‚∏ª

4. Seaweed (Nori, Dulse, Wakame)

	‚Ä¢	Use: Crumbled into soups or salads ‚Äî midday or early dinner

	‚Ä¢	Function: Provides iodine, selenium, and trace elements for thyroid function and cell metabolism

	‚Ä¢	Mechanism: Supports metabolic rate and detoxification, especially in low-calorie or fasting phases

	‚Ä¢	Tip: Small daily doses are ideal; too much iodine can be overstimulating

‚∏ª

Best Time to Eat:

During low-insulin windows‚Äîideally late morning, midday, or after light movement. These are not meal replacements, but ritual foods: small, dense inputs that extend fasting benefits, initiate cell repair, and prime longevity signals without overwhelming digestion or glucose regulation.

‚∏ª

Summary:

Think of these foods as internal incantations‚Äîyou‚Äôre whispering to your body: ‚ÄúKeep clearing, keep healing, keep going.‚Äù They don‚Äôt demand‚Äîthey assist. In the long arc of energy, they help stretch youthfulness, sharpen thought, and keep the system tuned and flowing, even while doing less. This is longevity, not by adding more‚Äîbut by aligning deeper.

‚∏ª

4. Temporal Eating: When to Cast the Spell

Your metabolism isn‚Äôt just what you eat‚Äîit‚Äôs when you eat it. The body is a circadian system, tuned to light and rhythm. Hormones like insulin, cortisol, melatonin, and leptin rise and fall in patterns that determine how food is used or stored. Think of meals as metabolic spells‚Äîeach one gains or loses power depending on timing. Aligning your meals to these rhythms transforms ordinary eating into biochemical alignment.

‚∏ª

Morning (6:00‚Äì10:00 AM): AMPK Activation

Goal: Wake the system, keep insulin low, reinforce fat-burning

Ideal Inputs:

	‚Ä¢	Apple cider vinegar + warm water

	‚Ä¢	Black coffee or cold-brew (optional: MCT oil)

	‚Ä¢	Green tea (EGCG)

	‚Ä¢	Raw cacao nibs

	‚Ä¢	Cinnamon in tea or added to black coffee

Why: Morning cortisol is naturally elevated; insulin sensitivity is just rising. Avoiding starch and focusing on fasted-state support strengthens metabolic flexibility and enhances alertness.

‚∏ª

Midday (11:00 AM‚Äì2:00 PM): Growth & Brain Mode

Goal: Peak mental and physical fuel window
Ideal Inputs:

	‚Ä¢	Grass-fed meat, pasture eggs
	‚Ä¢	Blueberries or wild berries
	‚Ä¢	Walnuts, dark chocolate
	‚Ä¢	Wild salmon or sardines
	‚Ä¢	Bone broth + fermented veg
	‚Ä¢	Quinoa or legumes for plant-based protein

Why: This is when your body is primed to handle proteins and build tissue. mTOR and SIRT1 activation cross here‚Äîoffering a chance for repair and synthesis, especially post-exercise or deep thinking.

‚∏ª

Afternoon (3:00‚Äì5:00 PM): Calm & Clear
Goal: Wind down metabolic heat, clear toxins, stabilize hormones
Ideal Inputs:

	‚Ä¢	Ginger + lemon tea
	‚Ä¢	Cruciferous vegetables (raw or lightly steamed)
	‚Ä¢	Beets (roasted or juiced)
	‚Ä¢	Green olives, seaweed
	‚Ä¢	Light fats (e.g., dandelion root tea or avocado slices)

Why: The body begins its descent into parasympathetic mode (repair, rest). Supporting liver pathways and digestion now smooths the night phase. Avoid high protein or sugar‚Äîstimulates wrong signals.

‚∏ª

Evening (6:00‚Äì8:00 PM): If Eating, Make It Low-Insulin

Goal: Ground, reset, and don‚Äôt spike blood sugar before rest

Ideal Inputs:

	‚Ä¢	Steamed broccoli, kale, or arugula
	‚Ä¢	Wild-caught fish or pasture-raised eggs
	‚Ä¢	Herbal saut√© with garlic, turmeric, dulse
	‚Ä¢	Small protein serving, no starch

Why: Late-night starch disturbs sleep quality and disrupts melatonin cycles. Light protein and cruciferous vegetables support detox, hormone balance, and melatonin alignment.

‚∏ª

Night (Post-8:00 PM): Close the Spell

Goal: Cease metabolic demands; enter full parasympathetic repair

Ideal Inputs:

	‚Ä¢	Chamomile or ginger tea
	‚Ä¢	Magnesium-rich herbal blends
	‚Ä¢	Dandelion root (if light digestion needed)

Why: Eating late blunts growth hormone release during deep sleep. Liquid rituals signal the day‚Äôs closing‚Äîa biochemical ‚Äúamen‚Äù to the cycle of transformation.

‚∏ª

Summary:

Think of your meals as incantations tuned to a metabolic clock. What you eat matters‚Äîbut when you eat it turns it into medicine or noise. Align with the body‚Äôs light-scripted ritual, and even simple foods become potent spells of energy, clarity, and regeneration.

‚∏ª

5. Sympathetic vs Parasympathetic Timing

The autonomic nervous system runs on two opposing but harmonizing branches: the sympathetic (‚Äúfight, flight, act‚Äù) and the parasympathetic (‚Äúrest, digest, repair‚Äù). Food acts as a neuromodulator, triggering shifts between these states. Timing your meals with this polarity can tune your metabolic field for either action or regeneration‚Äîjust like toggling the spell mode of the day.

‚∏ª

High-Protein Meals = Sympathetic Dominance

Protein-rich meals (especially those high in leucine, tyrosine, and glutamate) stimulate:

	‚Ä¢	Dopamine and norepinephrine release
	‚Ä¢	Thermogenesis and metabolic ramping
	‚Ä¢	Cognitive arousal and readiness

Ideal times:

	‚Ä¢	Mid-morning to midday
	‚Ä¢	Post-workout
	‚Ä¢	Before focused, high-output tasks

These meals ‚Äúwake the field‚Äù‚Äîactivating synthesis, muscle building, and mental focus. Grass-fed beef, pasture eggs, Greek yogurt, and legumes signal ‚Äúgo mode‚Äù to both the brain and body.

‚∏ª

High-Fat + Low-Carb Meals = Parasympathetic Support

Fats (especially MCTs, omega-3s, and monounsaturated oils) promote:

	‚Ä¢	GABAergic calm
	‚Ä¢	Stable blood sugar
	‚Ä¢	Mitochondrial support without insulin stimulation
	‚Ä¢	Deepened vagal tone and digestive flow

Ideal times:

	‚Ä¢	Afternoon wind-down (3‚Äì5 PM)
	‚Ä¢	Evening light meals
	‚Ä¢	Fasting windows or low-insulin mornings

These foods guide the system into repair, stability, and hormonal recalibration‚Äîsupporting healing, autophagy, and clear transition into sleep cycles.

‚∏ª

Food Ritual as Rhythm Control

Your body listens not just to ingredients but sequence and intention. Repeating consistent meal types in the same time blocks teaches the nervous system to expect:

	‚Ä¢	Activation in the morning / early day
	‚Ä¢	Winding down in the afternoon / night

This entrains metabolic rhythm, stabilizes mood, sharpens hunger signals, and improves sleep. In field logic, this is symbolic programming: the way you eat writes the rhythm of your day.

The takeaway:

Don‚Äôt just eat for nutrients‚Äîeat for state control.
Structure meals like musical cues: fast notes to energize, deep tones to heal.
Food is not just fuel‚Äîit‚Äôs your tuning fork.

‚∏ª

6. Bonus: Symbolic Pairings for Intentional Ingestion

Beyond biochemistry lies the realm of symbolic nourishment‚Äîwhere foods become carriers of intention, energy, and archetypal pattern. Pairing ingredients by both physiological effect and symbolic resonance creates a kind of edible ritual magic: each meal becomes a statement of alignment, not just survival.

These combinations activate the metabolic field through coherence of function and meaning. Think of them as potions made from grocery aisle ingredients‚Äîbut aimed at the soul-body interface.

7. Conclusion: Eat Like a Sorcerer

Don‚Äôt just eat. Cast.

Every bite is a signal, every meal a ritual. In the metabolic field, food is not just fuel‚Äîit‚Äôs code, and you are the programmer. Your body is a living altar of biochemical alchemy, and the grocery store is stocked with spell components. When you eat with intention, you don‚Äôt just feed the body‚Äîyou realign the field.

To master metabolic witchcraft is to:

	‚Ä¢	Know the signal (mTOR, AMPK, SIRT1)

	‚Ä¢	Match the cycle (circadian timing, sympathetic/parasympathetic states)

	‚Ä¢	Send the message (symbol + nutrient = resonance)

Forget calorie obsession and crash diets. That‚Äôs peasant thinking.
You are composing resonance‚Äîlayering flavor, timing, and intent to sculpt your future state.

Eat like a sorcerer.
Because the body listens.

S2E9: ""The After Hours""

Jame and Helena's House: Egg Eating Scene.

- At (Timestamp 2:58) we get a good overview of the layout. Behind Jame (He's standing kind of catty-cornered, so by behind, I am referencing the left, glass wall.) We see a lamp on a decorative stand and a nice chair. That is all we see in terms of furniture and decorum in reference to what is behind Jame. (This is critical later) In terms of the landscape outside, directly ahead of Helena is a less wooded area and an open field off in the distance slightly to the right. On the left side, is the very wooded area we see as Helena walks down the hall and makes a right. (Timestamp 2:20-2:21)

- We see Helena split the egg into 6 pieces. (Timestamp: 3:09-3:29) We see them positioned around the man's head sitting in the chair at 3:29.

- 4 seconds later, we see the plate again but instead of 6 pieces, there are only 5. you can also see the egg on the fork before she cuts into it. From (Timestamp 3:29-3:33) we do not see Helena eat anything. 

-The egg on the fork is from the yellow yolk. Throughout this scene we only see Helena eat the albumen. 

- Pay close attention to the position of the 6 parts of the egg and where Helena places them in reference to the characters on the decorative plate.
  
- If slice (1) is the top left portion, which is slanted in the same angle just off center of the blue dressed woman's top hate, going clockwise would make slice (6) the portion just below her face. This slice's (6) yolk is already starting to break apart from the albumen, as is slice (1) towards the very top. Slice (2) is coming across the red woman's top hat diagonally and covering her face.  (Timestamp 3:28)

- At (Timestamp 3:31) with Helena in view off to the left is some decorative piece with wires that are curvy that ends in some bulbous looking flower. This would be to Helena's right if we imagine ourselves behind her, much like we see in (Timestamp 2:53-2:54). Recall that this piece was NOT behind Jame. We see this same art piece in the same location relative to Helena. (Timestamp: 3:46)

- As mentioned previously, at (Timestamp 3:34) upon the fork we see remnants of egg yolk already on it without Helena eating anything. She goes for what would be slice (6) and we see her break the yolk away by pulling down on the albumen. Furthermore, slice (1) is now making a ""X' across the top hat and is no longer parallel with it.

- This is where I will lose some of you, but that's all well and good. I urge you though to watch and listen carefully (Timestamp 3:42-3:45). Jame starts to rotate his coffee mug and slides his index across the top of the handle. Right when he gets to the far left edge of the handle, you hear an auditory click. In unison with this click while watching Helena's face, her head snaps to the right and she starts her dialogue about dealing with Mr. Bailiff. Jame's finger goes back to the starting point of where he started to run the mug (right side of the handle and rests)

- At (Timestamp 3:51) you can see 3/4 prongs of the fork piercing through the egg with the prong closest to the viewer exposed. At (Timestamp 3:52) as Helena goes to put the egg into her mouth you can now see all 4 prongs with none of them protruding through the egg. How the egg is even attached is beyond me lol. 

- We now see Jame Eagan with the decorative flowery art piece directly behind him, off his right shoulder (Timestamp 3:55). Looking out the window we see the landscape that was previously out in front of Helena from her POV with the open field off to the right, behind Jame now. 

- Okay, so this one is a bit tricky but you have to think about how physics would work in an inverted reality. If you've seen Christopher Nolan's Tenet, how things work when the Protagonist goes through the turnstiles is a pretty good example of what we see at (Timestamp 4:03-4:05) in terms of what's happening. The flow of time is backwards so the laws of physics are working backwards. More simply put, the law of causality is seen in reverse from the perspective of those viewing it from a standard flow of time. 

- Helena bumps the egg closest to the viewer slightly and then places the fork off to the side of it as she is gently pushing the fork forward. Pay close attention to the next egg (Going clockwise). As she is pushing the fork forward, without contacting what we will now call Slice (2) moves left to right away from the viewer. THEN, as she releases the fork it bumps into the egg closest to the viewer kickin it ass-end around counterclockwise. Now imagine slice (2) never moved. This action after releasing the fork and connecting with slice (1), would in turn push slice 2 to its position it is already resting at. Mind you, this happened before the events of her releasing the fork. Essentially in terms of cause and effect, what we the viewer witnessed was the effect prior to the cause. The Law of Causality states that the cause always precedes the effect.

- (Timestamp 4:06-4:10) Helena and Jame's sweaters have changed colors from blue to a darkish green. 
 
Analysis

It is my opinion that we are jumping back and forth from two different timelines, albeit done so through witty and sly cinematography, and top-tier editing. We are seeing what I will call the standard time line and the reflective/mirror timeline. 

We see Helena looking towards her Father at (Timestamp 3:32) and then at (Timestamp 3:34) the camera cuts to a different plate that is not the same as the one we see at (Timestamp 3:28) as evidenced by the positioning of the slices, 6 vs 5 egg slices, and yolk being upon the fork (Timeline switch). Other switches are done when looking at the plate until we see the art piece behind Jame and the color of the sweaters change. When looking at the plate we do not see either of them, but the plates are telling a different story than we saw beforehand. It's a very witty and skillfully done move/choice by the production team. 


In S1E8 ""What's for Dinner"" we see Helly at (Timestamp 21:19) eat the entirety of an egg, yolk and albumen, and love it. Again, we only see Helena in this scene eat the albumen. To further elaborate, or speculate on this point, I will save that for the section of speculation below

Regarding Helena only eating the Albumen, that is all we the viewer see. This is not to say she does not eat the yolk but it is indiscernible to us as the scene transitions and focuses more on Jame. You can hear the fork and knife on the plate during those parts of the scene as well, potentially being times when Helena scoffs down the yolk. However, this is inconsequential to the scene in terms of what I'd argue are two different timelines being spliced together concurrently expertly to portray the illusion of what is seemingly, a seamless scene. But...

Speculation

Many redditors have already speculated based on Jame's words to Helly R. in S2E10 Cold Harbor that Helly R. may assume the role as Helena in an outie/innie switch. That hateful smirk we see from Helena at (Timestamp 4:10) reminds me more of Helly R. than Helena Eagan. Sure, Season 2 lays the groundwork and tidbits of clues regarding Helena's disdain for her family-cultish, lack of nurture upbringing, but we never see hate in her eyes. One scene that comes to mind is the conference room with Drummond, Natalie, and herself where she does show apprehension for the decision to send her back down to the Severed floor, but my gut-instinct just immediately screamed... THAT'S HELLY. Could I be wrong here? Absolutely, hence why I left this part of my thoughts for speculation. We could be seeing a future scene in which Jame is watching Helly eat eggs, to see if she does so in the manner of Kier Eagan's favorite way of ingesting them, raw. This line of thinking also tracks with his dialogue, ""I wish you'd take them raw."" If it is Helena I can only imagine her thinking, ""No shit, you've made that abundantly clear for the entirety of my 30 years of life."" IF it is Helly, it tracks as more of a guiding and educational moment as Jame tries to groom her. To play the devil's advocate, it is no surprise to anyone that Jame is weird and creepy as hell. I very much so can imagine him telling Helena every time she eats eggs of his disdain for how she eats eggs. I could also see him neglecting to eat with her and simply just... watching. Dude's a grade-A weirdo, as you'd expect as the leader of a cult. I'll just say that if I had 50 bucks and Vegas gave me somewhat favorable odds, that is Helly. I'd put 35$-40$ on it. 

One last note*

I use a browser extension called ‚Äúvideo speed controller‚Äù to slow down some of the quicker and faster happenings in scenes. It really helps with picking up on the auditory click mentioned and the movement of the egg towards the end of the scene. However, for this scene it is not essential to pick up on what I laid out. It makes it easier, but it can be down at regular playtime speeds though a few rewinds and rewatches may be necessary. ",1,1747798603.0,SeveranceDecoded,0,1.0,False

(Part 1),"Honestly, when I mention this to people, no one else seems to remember this. I‚Äôm not sure why this seems to linger in my mind every night. When I mention the riots in ‚Äô93, they talk about the riots in LA.

They don‚Äôt remember the sirens screaming all night. They don‚Äôt remember the men in gas masks knocking on every door, telling us to leave. The shortages, the fear, the paranoia, the evacuations of entire cities‚Äîalmost the whole state.

I was one of the few who stayed. Some couldn‚Äôt leave for other reasons. Some chose not to leave. Sometimes, I would find their doors broken down and their bodies shredded like sheets of paper. As for me, I stayed because I had a new job to do.

They call us collectors. In reality, we just go off whatever names they give us. Some call us vultures. Usually, people are desperate enough or crazy enough to collect samples and intelligence from the quarantine zone for the eggheads or Uncle Sam. Some of us lived colorful lives. Some were given a choice: prison or being a collector. Some of us were contractors before this, or washed-up veterans, or ex-cops. As for me‚ÄîI had my own reasons.

They send us in by ourselves, or in pairs if they feel like we‚Äôre important. I wish I was that lucky, but then again, luck has never been my strong suit. When we‚Äôre not doing Washington‚Äôs dirty work, we‚Äôre holed up somewhere, licking our wounds in the cold. Some like to make their own little hideouts in the nooks and crannies. As for me, I always believed in safety in numbers‚Äîplus, they tend to attack groups of people less.

I tended to shack up in this big church. Some other collectors were there every now and again. Usually, it was just me, the pastor, and a few vagrants who had nowhere else to go‚Äîno one else to turn to. It was a nice spot, actually. The pastor always kept the fire going and had some beds set out in the main worship area.

It was like any other day in this hellhole of a state. I was sitting by the fireplace on a cushion with a cup of coffee cradled in my hands‚Äîinstant, of course. But hey, I take what I can get. Despite the coffee tasting like a combination of charcoal and gas, and the absence of sugar, I took another sip. I glanced over my shoulder to see a few people huddled in blankets, lit cigarettes hanging from their chapped lips. I glanced out the warped window and saw the snow was starting to pick up. Snowflakes began to gently tap the glass.

I was just about to finish my coffee when I heard the distinct sound of my pager chiming. I groaned as I dug into my pocket and glanced down at the minuscule screen‚Äîa radio frequency to tune into. I gulped the last of my gritty coffee and tramped over to my bag for my SINCGARS radio. I set it up quickly: single channel, plain text, punched in the frequency. Then I grabbed the receiver.

‚ÄúScepter to Nest, radio check, over.‚Äù

The feminine voice of my handler chimed in from the other end of the net.

‚ÄúHearing you. Got some work for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúHit me.‚Äù

‚ÄúGot a hit from the Marines. They say there‚Äôs some unusual activity in the mall on Grover Street. They want a specialist to look into it.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes and let out a sigh.
‚ÄúCould they be more specific?‚Äù

There was a short pause before Nest finally responded.

‚ÄúSome of the grunts said they heard something coming from the old mall. Not sure how it‚Äôs possible.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, me neither. Well, I‚Äôll start hoofing it there.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, no need for that. There‚Äôs a convoy you can hitch a ride with to the mall.‚Äù

I furrowed my brow.
‚ÄúHow did you manage that?‚Äù

I heard a soft chuckle from the other end.
‚ÄúI have my ways. Get geared‚Äîthey‚Äôre gonna pick you up soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hear. Scepter, over and out.‚Äù

I hung up the receiver and gathered my gear. Of course, it wasn‚Äôt much‚Äîhalf of it was old surplus gear from Vietnam or stuff I managed to get from camping stores that hadn‚Äôt been completely looted. I finished putting on my MOPP suit, clipped my gas mask bag to my hip, grabbed my ALICE pack and my weapon case, and stepped outside as the sound of diesel engines rumbled closer.

I walked outside to see a six-vehicle convoy of weathered Humvees and five-ton trucks driving down the snow-covered street, a truck with a snow plow mounted on the front clearing the way. The line of vehicles came to a halt. A Marine in full MOPP gear waved over to me from a canvas-covered truck. I walked over as he leaned out the driver-side window to get a better look at me.

‚ÄúYou the collector?‚Äù he asked, the gas mask muffling his voice.

I nodded, and he thumbed behind him.
‚ÄúHop in, man. We‚Äôll drop you off on the way.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt waste any time and quickly threw my things into the back of the covered five-ton. I climbed into the shadowy interior. Half of the metal benches inside were occupied by the hunched-over shapes of Marines with combat loads, rifles slung over their chests. Arms crossed, some shivered in their MOPP gear. A few didn‚Äôt wear their gas masks‚Äîlit cigarettes hung from their lips. Stacks of framed ALICE packs filled the empty space across the benches. I settled into my icy seat as a few of the Marines gave me quiet grunts of acknowledgment.

The truck hissed before speeding off. There was little sound besides the rumble of the engines and the scent of burning diesel and cigarette smoke hitting my nostrils. I gazed out the back of the truck as the convoy passed half-buried wreckages of cars and the remains of what were once police checkpoints.

The uncomfortable silence was finally broken as one of the younger Marines turned to look at me‚Äîa question weighing heavy in his mind.

‚ÄúI gotta ask, why do you collectors do this shit? Ain‚Äôt most of you civvies?‚Äù

I snapped out of my trance and pivoted toward him. I offered a shrug.
‚ÄúMost of us are. But we all got our reasons. Just like all of you, I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre kind of forced to be here. You can just leave‚Ä¶ right?‚Äù he asked naively.

I quietly scoffed.
‚ÄúYou must be new around here. We can‚Äôt leave, even if we wanted to.‚Äù

That deflated his curiosity. His shoulders slumped, but he stayed quiet. The truck continued to rumble as it negotiated a large pothole‚Äîno doubt grown bigger from a year or more of nonexistent repairs.

The convoy stopped just shy of entering a semi-crowded parking lot. Some cars were still left. Many of the windows had already been smashed, the tires slashed, or missing entirely. Even with the snow, I could still see piles of scorched tires. Half-frozen corpses still buckled into their seats. Some clutched their loved ones, never letting go even after death. Others clutched icy weapons that could never save them.

An all-too-common sight nowadays‚Äîa constant reminder for those like me. Doomed to join the frost.

A multi-story behemoth of concrete and faded store logos jutted out over the horizon‚Äîthat was once a mall. Its numerous frosted-over windows hid its spiraling depths from view. I could feel the five-ton slowing to a stop as it let out another hiss before falling motionless. Without a word, I stood up from my seat, dropped my gear out of the truck, and hopped down with a grunt.

‚ÄúGood luck, collector,‚Äù one of the Marines said as I departed.

I took a deep breath, reached for the carrier bag on my hip, and pulled out my gas mask. I quickly donned it and pulled over the chemical hood, zipping it tight. The Marines only stared as their convoy sped away, leaving me to my own devices.

I reached for the receiver hanging on my bag strap and keyed in.

‚ÄúNest, I‚Äôm on site. Not seeing much yet. Looks pretty standard.‚Äù

‚ÄúStandard as in‚Ä¶?‚Äù she asked, waiting for me to elaborate.

‚ÄúNot seeing any shells. Still some bodies around. At least not any fresh ones. Gonna load up. Over.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you know the deal‚Äîtry to take lots of pictures and get a live feed if you can.‚Äù

‚ÄúGot it,‚Äù I said, hanging up my handset on the strap of my bag.

I kneeled down and keyed in the code for my case. With a soft click, it popped open. I grabbed my thirty-eight and my twelve-gauge. I loaded it up with double-aught buckshot, chambered a round, and walked toward the smashed front door.

The interior was dimly lit from the half-covered skylight. I could still make out the outlines of abandoned storefronts. Trash and debris dotted the floor. I stooped under the half-shattered door, boots crunching on glass.

‚ÄúMaking entry,‚Äù I whispered into my handset as I stepped inside.

A long hallway of looted storefronts and barred gates spiraled ahead of me.

‚ÄúCopy. Get me a live feed, Scepter,‚Äù Nest responded‚Äîher tone less carefree now.

I reached for the shoulder-mounted cam, switched it on, and set it to record.

1kro8kn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfyChairs/comments/1kro8kn/can_i_leave_a_rattan_chair_outside/,Can I leave a rattan chair outside?,"Emily had always loved the cozy, natural look of rattan furniture. When she spotted a beautiful rattan chair at a weekend flea market, she didn‚Äôt think twice. It had a curved back, handwoven details, and just enough vintage charm to make her small patio feel like a peaceful retreat. The seller told her it was a good piece for both indoor and outdoor use, and that was all the encouragement she needed.

Back home, Emily placed the chair on her back porch, under partial shade. It wasn‚Äôt fully covered, but it wasn‚Äôt in direct rain or sun all day either. She figured it would hold up just fine, especially in the mild spring weather.

At first, everything was great. She‚Äôd sit out there with her morning coffee, read in the afternoons, and even had a few friends over who complimented the chair. But after a couple of weeks, she started to notice some changes. The color of the rattan began to fade a little, and a few of the strands looked slightly warped. It hadn‚Äôt rained much, but the morning dew and moisture in the air seemed to be taking a toll.

Curious (and a little worried), Emily decided to do some digging online. She started reading through home decor forums and Reddit threads where other people had shared their experiences. That‚Äôs when she learned the important difference between *natural* rattan and *synthetic* rattan. Natural rattan, which her chair was made from, isn‚Äôt really meant to live outside unless it‚Äôs in a fully covered area, like a sunroom or enclosed porch. It‚Äôs sensitive to moisture and UV rays, which can cause it to crack, fade, and even develop mold if it stays damp for too long.

Emily came across several stories from people who had left their natural rattan furniture outside and ended up regretting it. Some had to toss out their chairs after a season because the material became brittle and unusable. Others recommended using outdoor covers, applying a protective sealant, or moving the furniture indoors during bad weather.

Realizing she might lose the chair if she left it out much longer, Emily moved it inside, placing it by a sunny window where it still gave her that relaxed patio vibe. She ended up buying a weather-resistant synthetic rattan set for her patio instead‚Äîone that looked similar but could handle rain and sun much better.

The whole experience taught her a lot. While rattan has that lovely, laid-back look, it‚Äôs not all created equal. If it‚Äôs natural, it needs protection. If it‚Äôs synthetic (often labeled as ‚Äúall-weather wicker‚Äù), then it‚Äôs made for the outdoors. Emily didn‚Äôt regret her purchase, but she was glad she caught the signs early before the chair got damaged beyond repair.

In the end, she had a beautiful indoor reading spot and a tougher, outdoor-friendly seating area too. And now, anytime someone asks if they can leave a rattan chair outside, she shares her story‚Äîwith a clear ‚Äúit depends!‚Äù and a few tips on what to look for.",1,1747798422.0,ComfyChairs,0,1.0,False

Met an Aquarius man (37M). Been hanging out casually - haven‚Äôt even hugged cause I‚Äôm scared of catching feelings - for like a month. Knew within seconds of seeing him that there was something there. Then we chatted for like 1 min and I was like ‚Äúwhoa‚Äù. 
Fast forward, first hang and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúokay‚Ä¶not pretentious, knowledgeable about both random and big things, warm and encouraging towards me, kinda shy, genuine, independent, super open about his life, passionate, doesn‚Äôt interrupt me, listens, challenges me, accepts my challenges, etc, etc.‚Äù and we chatted for hours not realizing how time flew by. I haven‚Äôt met someone I could connect like this with in YEARS!!! I could approach any topic with him.

Neither of us has shared any of our feelings with the other, but I at the very least have a crush on him. And am like 89% sure he is feelin it too. He invited me inside after dinner one night but I was genuinely very tired and also didn‚Äôt want to rush into things (kept that part to myself), it was maybe our 3rd or 4th hang, but I really like him and just want/need to move slowly. My last 3 relationships were all rushed and I didn‚Äôt even like any of them this much lol

I would love to continue letting it ride out and keep getting to know each other and maybe in another week or two make a move (if he still hadn‚Äôt yet) but he is now moving across the country!! He wasn‚Äôt sure if he was gonna stay or not (remote worker, lease is ending) so I especially didn‚Äôt want to say anything this early on because I didn‚Äôt want to influence his decision only to find we don‚Äôt really mesh well another month down the road. Maybe the sex won‚Äôt be good, for instance. I am now regretting not going inside after dinner lol

He leaves Saturday and due to work schedules, tomorrow morning (Wednesday) is probably the last time we will see each other before he goes. All of a sudden I am feeling a huge flood of emotions and am so sad about it. Literal tears. I was bummed out but kind of denying my feelings I think. I am avoidant af. Now I‚Äôm like, sadddd.

I want to tell him over coffee tomorrow pretty much all of that in a controlled, non-dramatic way lol. I feel like I need to at least tell him how much he has affected me in a positive way and that I‚Äôm sad he‚Äôs leaving and am enjoying getting to know him and was interested in seeing where things might go. But also I get it and didn‚Äôt wanna influence him or rush things for the wrong reasons.

He is still interested in potentially living here, but is a little unsure about life plans atm (we are both perpetually wandering souls) and so who knows. He is also very pragmatic so I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll just move back on a whim or without a solid plan (I‚Äôm a Libra, Leo, Leo and the complete opposite in that regard). I am also interested in living in the area he is moving to (I used to and I miss it) but that‚Äôs getting waaayyyy ahead of myself - just want to illustrate for y‚Äôall the flexibility yet uncertainty of these two neurotic people. 

Okay so, should I say the things just to get it out there? I‚Äôm worried I might start crying (which would be kind of embarrassing cause we haven‚Äôt known eachother that long/ might scare him away‚Ä¶? Even though I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be judgmental about it). Is there anything I need to add or leave out? If you were him what would be good to hear and not so good to hear? If you were me, any further thoughts?

TLDR: guy I like is moving - do I tell him how I feel or will it just make things worse?",1,1747798240.0,aquarius,3,0.67,False

Today, my CP was accepted by my creditors. Reading other people‚Äôs experience here helped me made the decision to file and so I‚Äôd like to share my experience as well, in hope of giving some insight to those who might be in a similar situation.

I‚Äôm 28F and has made some bad financial decisions over the past few years.

Here‚Äôs the breakdown of my debts prior to filing:

1. RBC Credit Line - $35k
2. RBC Visa - $8,800
3. PC Mastercard - $10,700

Total:  $54,500

The only asset I have is my car and didn‚Äôt surrender it. 

I never missed any payments despite of the amount of debt I owe. However, since I started my mat leave last year, things got very tight and affected my already poor mental and emotional health. I felt like I hit rock bottom and there‚Äôs nowhere to go. 

At the end of 2024, I finally decided to seek help and restart - all for my little baby boy.  

I initially planned to file on January this year, but since some of the debts I had were recent, my LIT had advised to wait 90 days and file again. 

I‚Äôve received countless calls from PC and countless emails from RBC for a month prior to my filing because I missed paying on February. I had so much anxiety during those time and I cried every night from fear and shame. 

I finally filed my CP on April 4th with the agreement to pay $335 monthly for 5 years (Total: $20,100). I was very anxious since RBC is my major creditor and I had read so many rejected CPs or had to pay higher because of RBC. 

I was able to keep my BMO CC since there is no credit in it - I currently have no intention in using this so I shredded the card üôÇ

2 weeks after filing, creditors stopped calling and emailing me. 

To my surprise, after speaking with my LIT, my CP was accepted! I also did my first counseling today. 

I know this is just the beginning, but I can finally see a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel. I feel so much better and I‚Äôm very proud to say that I filed for CP and I cannot wait to complete it. 

It is tough to not be able to have a credit card that can be tapped at any time, but it has definitely helped me rethink of my life choices. So far, I haven‚Äôt had any impulse buy. I sold so much of my stuff in marketplace and use those money to buy coffee or food whenever I go out with my baby. I put the extra in my baby‚Äôs savings. Can‚Äôt wait to go back to work and hopefully be better at managing my finances. 

To those who are debating/thinking of filing for CP, please seek help. We all can get through this :)

1kro4od,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1kro4od/music_night_for_camp_bonding_activity_520/,Music Night for Camp Bonding! | Activity 5/20,"**Before the event**, there's a lot of preparations to be done. With the help of Harper Morales and other participants, Summer has managed (read: convinced them on her behalf) to design posters to advertise her event, print them, and distribute them all over camp. They read ""Music Night for Camp Bonding!"" in bold sparkly print, with any necessary dates and locations.

She made a set list ahead of time based on everyone's descriptions of their abilities, and was (thankfully) even persuaded that it would be necessary to supply sheet music to her recruits. These, she printed with Lucas's help again (his services are, frankly, the only thing keeping her from planning to target his very obvious insecurities). They are distributed to Summer's musical recruits as necessary a few days prior.

The ampitheatre has been dressed up with flower decorations, streamers, and fairy lights. There's a few tables at the corners of the event holding various snacks provided by camp, including some coffee and candy to give anyone in need the boost they needed to make it through the evening. Onstage, there's a microphone at the center and various instrument and sheet music stands off to the sides.

Once a decent audience has formed, **Summer starts the night off with her own opening act.**

Wearing one of her cheerful outfits, flowers caught in her hair, and painted fiddle in hand, she walks up to the microphone exuding a comfort and stage presence that suggests she's lived her life up in front of crowds. There's a smile playing at her lips, no hint of hesitation.

""Hello hello, Camp Half-Blood!"" Summer's practically beaming now, the picture of innocent excitement. ""Get ready to feel the good vibes, 'cause me and my crew have got a lot of it to share :D I'm Summer, and I'm gonna start us off! So, who's ready?""

With that, she lifts the fiddle to her chin, eyeing the space behind her coyly as she waits for some of her ""crew"" to file onstage.

The instrumental melody she plays next is one of her own invention. Besides Harper who's been given a general chord chart to accompany, she doesn't expect the rest of her recruits to join in much, but it adds to the ambience to have them up there. For that purpose, Summer's also requested for Helena and Rizal to plant themselves in the audience and start off the dancing if no one else seems game. Sometimes it only takes one to get a whole crowd going.

The fiddle starts off a little slower, tantalizing. Summer takes her time, before quickly picking up some added tension in the form of a couple complex runs, then finally breaking out into a bright, danceable chorus.

More than the music, though, is the fact that Summer carries an energy that is undeniably infectious‚Äîlike her or not.

She's grinning, moving and skipping and twirling around the stage, meeting the crowd's eyes when she can, completely in her element. Playing her instrument clearly comes to the girl effortlessly, less a tool and more an extension of herself. Harper's guitar carries through when she takes a moment to stomp out an accompanying beat with flair, and it's not long before at least some of her onstage crew and the audience members are clapping or stomping along in tune, carrying the beat for her. Then Summer's free to concentrate on the fiddle, moving into an improvised crescendo and the climax of the song, before gradually bringing it back down to Earth.

Hopefully it's loosened some limbs, gotten people in the mood for the performances to come next; that's all Summer wanted to achieve. She's happy with it in any case, breathing a little heavier but shining all the same. Summer comes back to the microphone, thanks everyone for their participation, and extends a hand to the stage behind her.

""**Next up**, we've got Tommy, Harper, and Friday, show them some love!""

\*\*\*

**OOC:**

The set is planned as follows, with Summer introducing and sending off each artist with equal enthusiasm, regardless of the success of their performance:

* **1.** Summer's opening, as previously described. 
* **2.** Tommy on vocals, Harper on electric guitar and vocals, Friday on bass, doing ""Everybody Talks"" and ""Beggin"" by Maneskin (Willow on the drums if necessary)
* **3.** Lino Fiedler, three songs including one original, American folk genre or showtunes
* **4.** Kiera Fleming with a¬†[rock set](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmUmYMLaWOr1Fzs8NyLeosnWBiKC-6bo2&si=kmbAx5-H3wfsHq_2) (Willow on the drums, Summer on miscellaneous percussion, Harper on bass, and so on as necessary)
* **5.** Austin Reynolds, three songs with guitar
* **6.** Harper and Ramona, instrumental version of ""Creep"" by Radiohead

Intermission, about ten minutes.

* **7.** Rizal's ballad
* **8.** Acacia on a flute cover of [""Once Upon a December,""](https://youtu.be/2TbmX3CQIXQ?si=OpGB1N4vayiGCax-) with Helena doing a ballet/interpretive dance performance to it
* **9.** Iphis solo on the talharpa
* **10.** Phae and Mohamed's duet, singing ""How Long?"" from Hadestown (Ramona viola, Summer brings out the banjo, Sera on the accordion, Harper on bass/guitar) and ""luther"" by Kendrick Lamar
* **11.** Booker on accordion and Mer on vocals, according to him
* **12.** Johnathon on the guitar, Summer supplying vocals
* **13.** Sera on accordion and Ramona playing the viola as a fiddle, ""Devil Went Down to Georgia""
* **14.** Open call for any audience members who want to jump in!
* **15.** Finale, Summer alternately on fiddle and vocals,¬†[""Keep On the Sunny Side""](https://youtu.be/NevnSl94aJY?si=hNLkiG7L7pAYO5V-) (Ramona as backup fiddle for when Summer has to sing, Lino/Johnathon/Harper on assorted string instruments, Acacia could add in some flute, Willow doing a bit of drums or flute as well, etc.) 
* \- Within the finale, there are plenty of openings for a player to come up for an improvised solo moment as well!

**Notes:** This lineup is based more so on the setlist Summer would have created in character, so people are welcome to deviate in their own descriptions of their acts- however, let me know if there are any glaring issues that I should fix. Note that the background instrumentals are more to give a suggestion of what might be seen up there and is not an exhaustive list. It can be assumed that any instrumental gaps were filled either with NPC nature spirit musicians or recorded backing tracks.

Below, I'll have a comment up under which you can post descriptions for your character's performance or roleplay it out if you like. 

\*\*\*

**By the time the end of the night rolls around** and Summer's closed off with her final song, she comes back to the microphone with a wide grin on her face.

""Thank you, everyone!"" she calls out. ""Hope we got to take your mind off things for a while. Now, let's hear it for our players tonight...""

That's the cue for the bows, presumably with mixed degrees of dramatics‚ÄîSummer's, for one, has a certain amount of flourish to it‚Äîand, well, that's that. Presumably, some stay to clean up their instruments while others take the opportunity to mingle with the departing crowd. ",5,1747798062.0,CampHalfBloodRP,14,1.0,False

Last week I spilled coffee on my laptop, and since I need it for work my bf borrowed me his. Now, I always had my suspicions that things didn't add up right, but I really wasn't expecting the things I found this weekend. 

My ex and I were together for a good 2 years, but there had always been issues. His kids did not work with mine, mainly because they were terribly spoilt, his bm was a never-ending issue (even though it had been quiet recently), and he was always going from one job to the other. Red flags all around, but love... right??

After we had lived together for a while we came to the vonclusion that that wasn't working after which he got his own place. Honestly, it went a lot better after that, and I really had been having high hopes recently. 

Until this weekend obviously. After I hot his laptop, I opened WhatsApp out of habit, and...poof....there it was! Multiple chats with women, I had no idea! I recognised one picture/ number and went to ask the girl (22F). She had no idea, he had the spent the week with her when I was on vacation, had 0 clue of our relationship, she had met him at work. I'm not mad at her, she actually keeps an eye out for me now. 

But there's more, and it gets crazier. Apparently, he was also busy doing his business partner (60F!!). For the longest time, I had no idea who she was as she lived abroad, but had moved here to buy property (I live in a very popular holiday destination). Now, I was still able to read up on his whatsapp, and this is where the craziness starts. 

This woman had already been accusing me of stalking her, even though I did not know her name until I saw their messages. I did make the mistake of publicly calling her a homewrecker on FB, which she has screenshot of, but I later realised he must have misled her too. She asks him if I am sane and if I thought if I was still in a relationship with him (I was until the night before, yes), if I was drunk when I came to see him, and that he should be careful because she is sure I am going to wreck his car. She even accuses me of doing a run-in on the airport, and that must have been me and that I am hiding. It then gets better: she has a notification of an unknown log-in from an email address and telephone number that both do not belong to me, but both are convinced I set it up. They even go as far as blocking their bank accounts (still following whatsapp) because they are sure I have had access to it. I feel like that is a bit much credit for my stalker abilities. 

Now, the cherry on top: they will take it to the police and the director of my work. Where I live, it's not big, and everyone knows each other, but they are still determined to ruin me. OVER 2 COMMENTS ON FACEBOOK!! 

This man was my partner for 2 years. Woke up in my bed almost every day, including on his birthday, apparently had dinner with her at night, and crawled into bed with me after that. 
I am heartbroken. I mean, I should be happy and finally good riddance, but how do I get over this?! How do I survive this attempt to ruin me and my daughter (8) because if I lose everything, she does too. 
What can I do?? How can I live and be happy knowing the man I loved and trusted is the OG cheater and manipulator. Also, he owes me money, quite a bit, and I would really have needed it. I still have his laptop and some random stuff. 

Please, I could use some words of advice and encouragement. 

TLDR; bf of 2 years turned out to be a serial cheater and is now falsely accusing me of breaking all sorts of laws, and he and his cougar want to ruin me. How do I move on?",1,1747797394.0,u_Hot-Age4245,0,1.0,False

Ive had experiences with greys. Nordics in the past but this whole CE5 metaphysical thing is new to me

Back in late 90s, 2000s meditation and the like was as alien to me as.. the aliens themselves. I never would associate anything with the two. Chalk and cheese.. polar opposites

But during covid lockdown thankfully I got into meditation and a connection. It did seem to...complete the puzzle so to speak

-

Cut to modern day, its a cold autumn/winter night here, rainy. Cold and dark.. not the kind of night to be venturing out - I was however.. critically out of 3 in 1 coffee sticks.. craving a good coffee

Supermarket was closing soon, (5km away) the wind and rain making it silly to make the mad dash in my EV scooter in search of coffee with everything against me.. it would have been a risk on multiple fronts.. i had bad feelings about it honestly, chose to stay home



I meditated in the back garden to reset myself. Into the nights sky.. venturing into the stars, seeking only peace, love, calm.. and..coffee

As stupid as it felt, when I opened my eyes, I saw a few vertical streaks in the sky. Moderately amused by it but not feeling anything. 

Soon after I noticed a growing compulsion to go inside and check under a chair thats in the corner of the room. Although the message was more akin to needing to clean my surroundings for a brighter feeling, a cleansing to feel lighter.. with the first target being the chair

Under it,

There, was 2x 3 in 1 coffee sticks, crumpled and seemingly been there for some time.. even of a different flavour that I usually buy but remember buying many months ago.

Somehow it just felt right to think of it as a gift from the sky people :)

With my experiences with greys and nordics in the past, theres just no way these beings hang around in the sky waiting for meditation on coffee and keeping someone safe.. my logical mind just doesnt..work.. that way

But here I am. Feeling uplifted, connected and happy having been given coffee from the sky people

And with that comes a wave of new trading platforms. One name that‚Äôs been popping up recently is **[Wondmatex](https://is.gd/MihJbO)** ‚Äî and if you‚Äôre like me, you're wondering: *Is this platform the real deal or just another sketchy trading site?*

Online trading platforms are becoming outrageously popular, especially with how easy they make it to start trading with little experience. **Wondmatex** claims to offer powerful features like real-time analysis, automated trading, and a beginner-friendly interface. But how well does it actually deliver?

In this review, I‚Äôll break down everything you need to know about Wondmatex ‚Äî what it is, how it works, who it‚Äôs for, and where it might fall short. I‚Äôll also share my honest thoughts on the platform‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses, so you can decide if it‚Äôs worth your time (and money). Let‚Äôs get into it.

## What is Wondmatex?

**Wondmatex** is an automated trading platform designed to help users trade various assets like cryptocurrencies, forex, and stocks ‚Äî even if they‚Äôve never traded before. It uses smart algorithms to scan the market and suggest or execute trades based on real-time data.

The platform says it aims to make trading accessible to beginners while still offering the depth and tools that experienced traders want. Think of it like having a trading assistant that works 24/7, without needing bathroom breaks or coffee.

It‚Äôs especially appealing for people who want to enter the trading game but don‚Äôt have the time (or the nerves) to stare at charts all day. Wondmatex helps take the guesswork out of trading by offering automated features, alerts, and market insights.

## Who Created Wondmatex?

The creators of Wondmatex are still somewhat under-the-radar, which is pretty common with platforms like this. From what I‚Äôve gathered, it‚Äôs developed by a team of **financial tech professionals and algorithm developers** who‚Äôve worked on similar platforms like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge**.

While the lack of public-facing founders might seem sketchy at first, this is actually pretty common in the automated trading space. The team seems more focused on the backend ‚Äî making the tech work ‚Äî than on building a personal brand.

That said, I‚Äôd still love to see more transparency here. A bit more detail about who‚Äôs behind the curtain would go a long way in building user trust.

### [üî• Start Trading with Wondmatex Today](https://is.gd/MihJbO)
## How Does Wondmatex Work?

Here‚Äôs the simplified version: Wondmatex uses an **AI-powered algorithm** to analyze massive amounts of market data in real-time. Based on this analysis, it identifies potential trading opportunities and either alerts the user or executes trades automatically, depending on your settings.

You can basically choose between **manual mode** (where you confirm trades yourself) or **auto mode** (where the platform trades on your behalf). The goal? Make profits off small market movements without needing to be glued to your screen.

The platform integrates with regulated brokers who handle the actual market orders. So while Wondmatex does the thinking and planning, the licensed broker executes the trade. It‚Äôs like a tag team of AI and real-world finance.

## Wondmatex Pros and Cons

Here‚Äôs the good, the bad, and the meh:

### Pros:
- **Beginner-friendly interface** with minimal learning curve
- **Real-time data and fast execution** of trades
- **Supports multiple asset types** (crypto, forex, stocks, etc.)
- **Demo account available** for learning and practice
- **Automated trading option** to save time

### Cons:
- **Minimum deposit of $250** may be steep for some users
- **Lack of transparency** about the development team
- **Limited educational content** for advanced traders
- **Not available in all countries**

Honestly, the pros outweigh the cons for most casual or beginner traders. But if you‚Äôre a hardcore day trader, it might feel a bit basic.

## Wondmatex ‚Äì Top Features

## Is Wondmatex a Scam?

I get why people are cautious ‚Äî trading scams are everywhere. But from my experience and research, **Wondmatex doesn‚Äôt show the usual red flags**.

- It works with **regulated brokers**
- Offers a **demo account** (scam platforms rarely do)
- Has **SSL encryption and privacy protections**
- Users can **withdraw funds easily**, usually within 24‚Äì48 hours

That said, always be cautious. No platform can guarantee profits. If someone promises 100% returns with zero risk, that‚Äôs your cue to run.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Wondmatex?

The **minimum deposit is $250**. This is pretty standard for platforms in this category.

That money isn‚Äôt a fee ‚Äî it‚Äôs your trading capital. You can start trading immediately or use the demo account to practice first.

My advice? Don‚Äôt deposit more than you can afford to lose. Start small, get comfortable, then scale up if everything checks out.

Support is **24/7**, which is legit. I tested it with a few basic and tricky questions.

- **Live Chat**: Fast responses, usually under 2 minutes
- **Email**: Replies within a few hours

They were polite, helpful, and didn‚Äôt dodge questions. That‚Äôs a win in my book.

My current setup has gotten sluggish, needing a system restart on some rare occasions. I don't plan to game on this AT ALL. Have the PS5 for that.

My current setup is a laptop from 2019 which has:
Intel Core i7-9750H 6 x 2.6 - 4.5 GHz, Coffee Lake-H
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Mobile - 6 GB VRAM, Core: 960 MHz, RAM: 1750 MHz, GDDR6, ForceWare 417.98, Intel UHD Graphics 630 (Optimus)
Memory16 GB, SO-DIMM DDR4 2666, dual-channel, 2 out of 2 slots occupied
Display15.60 inch 16:9, 1920 x 1080 pixel 141 PPI, BOE NV156FHM-N4G (BOE084D), IPS, 144 Hz
Mainboard Intel HM370.

My mobility needs have reduced so I want to get a desktop which can be cheaper than another beefy laptop that throttles all the time.

I currently have 2 pre-built offering in my budget (I understand tech but lack knowledge and time to buy individual components and built it myself). I'm from Australia and am looking at buying from the AfterShock store.
1st option:
Asus Prime B650M A WIFI II CSM DDR5
AMD Ryzen 5 7600 | 5.1 GHz | 6 Cores 12 Threads
32GB Crucial Pro 5600MHz (2x16GB)
MSI RTX 4060 Ventus 2X Black OC 8GB
DeepCool AK400 Black
2TB Gen4 Silicon Power UD90 M.2. NVME (R 5000MBs | W 3800MBs)
5 x 120mm Black Chassis Fan 2200rpm
650W Inwin B65E 80+ Bronze
Price: AUD 1600

2nd option:
Asus Prime B650M A WIFI II DDR5
AMD Ryzen 5 9600X | 5.4GHz | 6 Core 12 Threads
32GB Crucial Pro 5600MHz (2x16GB)
Aftershock M 42 Frost Air Cooler Black
1TB Gen4 Silicon Power US75 M.2. NVME (R 7000MBs | W 6000MBs)
2TB Western Digital Blue 7200RPM 3.5""
120mm Black Chassis Fan 2200rpm
650W Inwin B65E 80+ Bronze
Price: AUD 1700

So my questions are:
1. Do either of these setups offer significantly better performance than my current one?
2. Ryzen 5 9600X with no dedicated GPU vs Ryzen 5 7600 with RTX 4060. What would better suit my needs?
3. Another option would be to get the 9600X and add a basic GPU to it (if that's an easy process for a novice like me). If this is a reasonable option, what GPU would you recommend?
4. Any other suggestions if neither of these are appropriate? Budget has to be around the same +/-100 bucks.

Please advise me on this.

I'm working on automating application deployments in SCCM based on AD attributes, and my company wants a GUI visible throughout the installation process, showing the user that installations are happening and they can grab a coffee, etc.  Normally, I'd use a Task Sequence, but since those are only applicable to device-based deployments, that doesn't work here.  

So far, my best approach includes:  

- Using Application Groups in SCCM to bundle software  
- Creating a custom GUI pop-up with .Net or C# to keep users informed, until a final reg key is written, then it closes. 

However, I feel like there might be a better way to make this seamless.

Does anyone have experience tackling this?  I‚Äôm open to suggestions on making this more efficient while ensuring users get the experience my company expects.  Ultimately, I'd love to FULLY use out of the box solutions here (without using a custom GUI), but I'm feeling like it's not possible.

Especially during the holidays, I see a LOT of people online talk or post about traveling to the province to heal, to unwind, to adventure and all that. They post photos and vids of pristine beaches, tall coconut trees, quiet roads, or rows of ancestral houses. Some do storytime about how city life is too fast or too toxic for them. And say that going to the province feels like a return to a slow life.

Let‚Äôs be real here. Do these influencers know that many people in our provinces are poor?

Not every Filipino in the province is living their best life. They did not choose to participate in this *slow living* trend; they are forced into it!

How so? The provinces in the Philippines have the lowest daily wages. Many workers outside of Metro Manila earn way less than their urban counterparts. [While a minimum wage in Metro Manila is around P645 while workers in the provinces earn less](https://www.philstar.com/business/2025/05/02/2439974/city-province-workers-get-different-pay-same-work-why-labor-groups-say-its-unfair). This disparity contributes to a high rate of poverty. PSA says that ""individuals residing in rural areas have [higher poverty incidence at 22.1 percent compared to urban areas at 10.3 percent](https://psa.gov.ph/statistics/poverty).""

Not to mention healthcare is also limited. [Rural working-age adults are more likely to report issues with paying medical bills or delaying care due to cost](https://global.infervision.com/blog/making-healthcare-accessible-in-remote-philippine-islands-with-infervisions-inferair). Aside from stating the obvious that there are fewer hospitals in the provinces, those who suffer from the lack of healthcare are pregnant women, children, and the elderly. Even barangays have less to no doctors in their health centers. All these have greatly impacted services like diagnostic tests, obstetrics, and emergency care.

Yet on TikTok or Facebook or IG, we see influencers post about drinking coffee by the rice fields, feeding farm animals, playing with local children in the streets, staying in a buhay kubo for a weekend, being the main character while oblivious to the suffering of their kapwa-Pilipino. Some even have the gall to pretend to be poor just to get likes. They take photos in old markets, walk barefoot, wear cheap clothes and critic local delicacies to show to the world what *slow living* is like. But these influencers return to their air-conditioned homes in the city and enjoy fast internet when the cameras are off. But what they experienced is not the provincial life. It's just a performance! They take from these communities without giving anything back. They make it their brand to appear charitable. They sell the struggle as their *aesthetic*.

Basic needs like electricity and water are unstable in our provinces. Brownouts can last for hours, sometimes even days especially in remote areas. This unstable supply of electricity severely impacts internet access. [This means students struggle to attend online classes. Also qualified workers cannot apply for jobs that require reliable internet and local businesses cannot grow effectively](https://opinion.inquirer.net/181866/the-need-to-address-rising-costs-and-unreliable-supply-of-electricity).

The provinces are hit hard by corruption. Funds intended for roads, schools and relief often disappear. [It's estimated that P1.6 trillion lost to corruption in the 2024 alone](https://opinion.inquirer.net/182554/redemption-from-corruption). Corrupt practices mean that for ""every road or bridge that collapsed"" is due to millions were funneled to pockets of corrupt officials.

Our provinces are not your playground. They are not your escape plan. They are not your clean slate. People actually live there and they struggle every day. They deserve dignity and not romanticized IG stories.

If you want to go to the province, please go with open eyes. Instead of buying at a provincial Starbucks branch, please support local businesses! And pay fair prices! And if you really care, don‚Äôt just post about it. Push for better wages. Support healthcare access. Call out corruption!

Our provinces are not your healing retreats. These are real places with real people. And they deserve more than your clout-chasing TikTok post.",20,1747796457.0,unpopularopinionph,19,0.86,False

Granted ""right after dinner"" was at 1am in the morning and I woke up at 8am yesterday, so I don't think I was being particularly selfish.

This morning he woke me up at 7am in a horrible mood. First he ranted at me for two hours. He told me he doesn't see me as a person, woman, or wife but as a ""thing."" He told me I was abusing him by forgetting things. I have had a stroke so sometimes I hold my mouth a little crooked without noticing, especially when I'm tired. He kept getting mad at me for it, making fun of me, and calling me ugly.

  
He ordered my to get him food and open beer for him. All the while getting mad whenever I dared to ask questions like ""What do you want to eat?""

I was hungry too so I asked if I could eat to take my medicine. He kept refusing. Finally a few hours in he told me to eat half of the food I had set out for him, so I did. Then he got angry at me. While I was taking my medicine (aspirin and vitamins) he called me a junkie.

  
He told me I couldn't leave for work until the last minute, and that he might not even let me go to work. He guarded the door whenever I went near it.

  
He kept calling me names, and he tried to get me to take an intelligence quiz online. Because he doesn't believe I graduated college. he insists he has to be in charge of everything.

  
He also accused me of cheating with a previous manager and says I even admitted to it. I have never had an affair. I don't have contact with any of my coworkers outside of work. Said manager was a good guy and happily married. No romantic interest in him.

I have to go to the laundromat but he hasn't let me. I didn't want to start another fight by trying to get a shirt from the closet (and they are all really wrinkled, it's embarrassing) so I wore a dirty shirt to work. You can see my bra through it so I have to wear a jacket all day even though it's quite hot.

## What is ViennixPro?

**ViennixPro** is an automated trading platform designed to help users trade various financial assets like cryptocurrencies, forex, and stocks without needing to constantly monitor the markets. It uses smart algorithms and real-time data analysis to identify trading opportunities and execute trades on behalf of the user.

That means you don‚Äôt have to sit in front of your screen all day staring at candlestick charts or trying to time the market manually. ViennixPro does the heavy lifting for you. It‚Äôs especially appealing for newcomers who want to get into trading but aren‚Äôt sure where to start.

## Who Created ViennixPro?

The team behind ViennixPro keeps a pretty low profile, which is common in the trading bot world. While there‚Äôs no big-name founder like Elon Musk or Vitalik Buterin attached to it, the platform appears to be developed by a group of financial tech experts with experience in algorithmic trading.

This anonymity might raise eyebrows, but it‚Äôs not necessarily a red flag. Many reputable platforms have faceless teams, especially when they partner with regulated brokers to handle the financial side. Still, I‚Äôd prefer more transparency here‚Äîjust to feel extra confident about who‚Äôs handling things behind the scenes.

## How Does ViennixPro Work?

ViennixPro works by connecting to regulated brokers and using AI-powered algorithms to scan market data in real time. These algorithms look for trading signals‚Äîpatterns or price movements that indicate a good time to buy or sell.

Once a signal is found, the system can automatically place trades based on the parameters you‚Äôve set. You can also go manual if you want more control. The platform is designed to be intuitive, with a clean dashboard where you can monitor trades, set limits, and tweak your strategy.

The automation part is what makes it ideal for people with day jobs or zero trading experience. You don‚Äôt need to do much once it‚Äôs set up, but you still have full control over your account.

## ViennixPro Pros and Cons

Let‚Äôs keep it real‚Äîno platform is perfect. Here‚Äôs where ViennixPro shines and where it could do better.

One of the things I appreciate about ViennixPro is its **cross-device compatibility**. You can use it on:

- **Tablets (iOS/Android)**

It runs in the browser, so there‚Äôs no clunky software to download. The mobile version is especially slick, letting you check in on your trades during lunch breaks or while waiting in line for coffee.

## ViennixPro ‚Äì Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

ViennixPro uses real-time data to make split-second trading decisions. This isn't just helpful‚Äîit‚Äôs essential when markets move fast. The system constantly scans charts, news, and price movements to find profitable trade entries and exits.

### User-Friendly Interface

Even if you‚Äôve never traded before, you‚Äôll find the dashboard easy to navigate. Buttons are clearly labeled, menus are intuitive, and everything is laid out in a way that just... makes sense.

### Mobile Accessibility

The platform is fully optimized for mobile. I‚Äôve used it on both my iPhone and Android tablet, and it runs smoothly with zero lag. Great for on-the-go traders.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set personalized alerts for price movements, trade executions, or market trends. This helps you stay informed without being glued to the screen 24/7.

### Multiple Asset Trading

- **Bitcoin & Altcoins**
- **Forex Pairs**
- **Stocks**
- **Commodities**

This diversification can help balance your risk and opens up more trading opportunities.

## Is ViennixPro a Scam?

I had the same question when I first heard about it. After spending time with the platform, testing the demo, and even trading with real money, I can say with confidence: **It‚Äôs not a scam**.

- **Real-time trades are executed**
- **Withdrawals work (they can take a day or two)**
- **Customer support actually responds**

That said, always use your own judgment. If something feels off or too good to be true, take a step back. No platform‚Äîno matter how advanced‚Äîis a guaranteed money machine.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on ViennixPro?

The **minimum deposit is $250**, which is pretty standard for platforms like this. It‚Äôs a manageable amount to test the waters without risking too much upfront.

You can fund your account using:

You‚Äôll be connected with a broker for KYC verification. Upload your ID and proof of address, then deposit at least $250 to activate trading.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once funded, you can start auto-trading or try out the demo mode. Customize your settings if you want to control risk levels or trading frequency.

## How to Delete a ViennixPro Account?

If you ever want to leave, just contact support via email or chat. They‚Äôll close your account and ensure your data is removed. Make sure to withdraw your funds first!

1krneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1krneur/a_reflective_journey/,A Reflective Journey,"The pre-dawn chill bit through his thin work jacket as he trudged along the Calgary pavement. Another day, another shift hauling drywall and breathing dust. He was somewhere between his late twenties and early thirties, a distinction that felt meaningless. Time smeared together in a grey haze of exhaustion and cheap beer. His hands, rough and calloused, clenched in his pockets.

His boots crunched on the sidewalk, the only sound competing with the distant rumble of early traffic. His destination, as it was most mornings for years, was The Roasterie. It wasn't just the coffee, though it was good, strong enough to jolt him into a semblance of alertness. It was her. The barista with eyes the colour of warm honey and a smile that seemed, however briefly, to cut through his perpetual gloom. He knew her shifts, her way of tucking a stray strand of hair behind her ear, the lilt in her voice when she called out orders. He'd rehearsed countless opening lines in his head, imagined asking her out, but the words always died in his throat, choked by a certainty of rejection. Today, however, wasn't about courage. Today was different.

He pushed open the door, the bell announcing his arrival with a familiar jingle. The rich aroma of roasting beans enveloped him. She was there, wiping down the counter, her back to him. He ordered his usual ‚Äì black, large ‚Äì the words automatic. When she turned, her usual friendly smile flickered. ""Morning! The usual?""

""Yeah. Thanks,"" he mumbled, avoiding her gaze, fumbling with his debit card. He couldn't look at her, not today. Not when the camping gear and the length of sturdy rope were already packed in the back of his beat-up truck. Today, he was driving west, deep into Kananaskis Country, to find a quiet spot among the pines and end things.
The drive out of the city was a blur of familiar highways giving way to the imposing majesty of the Rockies. As the asphalt turned to gravel and the trees grew denser, a memory surfaced, unbidden. He was small, maybe eight or nine, bouncing in the passenger seat of his dad's old Ford. They were heading into the woods, just like this, but for a weekend of fishing and campfire stories. He remembered the smell of pine needles and engine oil, the weight of his dad's hand on his shoulder, the feeling of absolute safety. A sharp pang of loss hit him, so intense it almost made him pull over. That warmth, that security, had vanished when his dad died, replaced by a cold emptiness.

He parked the truck where the logging road became impassable, hoisted his pack, and started walking. He pulled out the roll of reflective tape, tearing off small strips and tying them to branches every fifty metres or so. Just in case, a small voice whispered, though he tried to silence it. Just in case you change your mind.
The forest deepened, swallowing the sounds of the road. The air grew damp and smelled of earth and decaying leaves. As he pushed through a thicket of underbrush, another memory, sharp and unwelcome, flashed behind his eyes. He was maybe twelve. His mom was slumped in her armchair, the television flickering, an empty bottle beside her. A cigarette smouldered between her fingers, dangerously close to dropping onto the threadbare upholstery. The smell of stale booze and smoke filled the small apartment. He remembered carefully plucking the cigarette from her slack hand, dousing it in the sink, the familiar mix of resentment and weary responsibility settling in his young chest as he struggled to guide her stumbling form to bed.

He walked for what felt like hours, finally finding a small clearing near a trickling creek. He set up the small tent, gathered firewood, and coaxed a fire to life as dusk bled through the canopy. He sat on a log, feeding sticks into the flames, watching the sparks spiral upwards towards the darkening sky. Stars began to prick the deep velvet overhead, countless and indifferent. He tilted his head back, truly looking at them. The sheer scale of it, the vast, silent emptiness dotted with distant, burning suns, made his own pain feel suddenly, strangely small. The finality he craved felt less like a release and more like... nothing. A meaningless erasure in the face of cosmic indifference. Doubt, cold and unfamiliar, crept into his thoughts.

Morning arrived damp and grey. He shivered, kicking dirt over the fire's embers. He packed his meagre supplies, the rope feeling heavy and obscene at the bottom of his pack. He turned to head back, scanning the trees for the first glint of reflective tape. Nothing. He walked a few paces in the direction he thought he‚Äôd come from. Still nothing. He checked his pockets. The roll of tape wasn't there. He must have dropped it, or perhaps misplaced the very last marker he'd tied.

Panic began to bubble in his chest. He started moving faster, circling the clearing, his eyes darting frantically between the trees. Every shadow looked like tape; every fallen leaf mimicked its shape. With the rising panic came the echoes of his mother's voice, slurred and angry, from years of drunken nights: ""Useless... just like your father... always a disappointment... never amount to anything..."" Failure. Lost in the woods, just as he was lost in life. The irony was bitter.

He sank to his knees, the damp earth soaking through his jeans. He couldn't find the way back. The forest felt like it was closing in, confirming what he already believed: he was trapped, hopeless. Maybe... maybe this was how it was supposed to be. The forest would take him, one way or another. His original plan seemed less like a choice and more like the only logical path left.
With numb resolve, he pulled the rope from his pack. He found a sturdy branch on a tall pine, tossed the rope over, and tied a crude but effective noose. Tears blurred his vision as he fashioned the knot, the rough fibres scraping against his skin. He looped the other end around his neck, the weight of it settling ominously. He stepped onto a large, moss-covered rock beneath the branch, took a shaky breath, and closed his eyes. The darkness behind his eyelids wasn't complete; for a fleeting, unbidden instant, an image of the barista's smile ‚Äì genuine, warm, the honey colour of her eyes seeing him, truly seeing him, if only for a moment over a coffee cup ‚Äì cut through the despair. Just as he prepared to step off, to surrender to the void, a tiny flicker of light at the very edge of his vision, even through nearly closed lids, made him hesitate. Low down, near the base of a spruce tree fifty feet away, something shone faintly in the dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves. He squinted. It wasn't a trick of the light. It was small, rectangular, and unmistakably reflective.

The last piece of tape.

He froze, the rope suddenly feeling incredibly tight around his neck. He hadn't lost it. It was right there. A way out.

Slowly, carefully, he loosened the noose, pulling it over his head. His hands were shaking. He stumbled towards the flicker of light, his heart pounding against his ribs. He reached down and touched the smooth plastic surface of the tape, clinging precariously to a low-hanging twig.
Holding it in his hand, looking from the tape to the noose still dangling from the branch, felt like seeing his life split into two distinct paths. One path led to oblivion, the other... back. Back to the truck, back to Calgary, back to the dust and the exhaustion, but also back to the smell of coffee, the possibility of warmth, the memory of his father's hand, the vastness of the stars.

He took it as a sign. Not a divine one, perhaps, but a sign from circumstance, from chance, from the simple fact that he hadn't lost the marker. He wasn't meant to end it here, alone in the woods.
He untied the noose, coiled the rope, and stuffed it deep into his pack. Following the trail of reflective markers, which now seemed blindingly obvious, he walked out of the forest. The drive back to Calgary felt different. The mountains still loomed, but they felt less like judges and more like silent witnesses.

He didn't know what would happen next. He didn't know if he could fix the broken parts of himself. But as he drove towards the city limits, one clear intention formed in his mind. Tomorrow morning, he would go to The Roasterie. And this time, he would say hello. He would look her in the eye and maybe, just maybe, ask her name.

1krnc5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/pitofcrocodiles/comments/1krnc5f/as_promised_here_is_a_detailed_report_of/,"As promised here is a detailed report of crocodile pits and the story of my father who threw me in one, as well as my revelation from Saint Hamudi himself.","Crocodile pits have historically been used as containment enclosures for crocodiles, often in zoos, sanctuaries, or, more grimly, in certain historical and mythological tales involving punishment or intimidation. These pits typically consist of a deep, enclosed area filled with water and mud, mimicking the natural habitat of crocodiles, and can range from simple dugouts to complex enclosures. Due to the territorial and aggressive nature of crocodiles, falling into such a pit can be fatal, making them potent symbols of danger, survival, and primal fear.

I was fifteen when my father decided I was too soft for this world. He was a man of hard edges, all scars and silence, forged in war and steel mills. That summer, we went to an off-grid wildlife compound in the Northern Territory of Australia‚Äîhalf zoo, half hell. The centerpiece was a pit: ten feet deep, murky water, and three crocodiles that looked like living relics from the Cretaceous. One morning, without ceremony, he grabbed me by the collar and said, ‚ÄúYou either sink or stand. Time to find out which.‚Äù Before I could protest, I was airborne‚Äîthen submerged.

I remember the silence under the water first, then the slow, terrifying awareness that something *else* was there. One of the crocodiles glided through the mud-dark water, eyes like dull gold coins, closing in. My limbs locked, panic rising in my throat like bile. And then‚Äî

A blinding light erupted beneath the surface.

Time warped.

From it emerged a figure cloaked in what looked like desert wind and storm clouds. He stood barefoot on the water, and the crocodiles recoiled like shadows meeting dawn.

‚ÄúI am Saint Hamudi,‚Äù he said, voice ringing like thunder in a cathedral. ‚ÄúThe Watcher Between Trials.‚Äù

He reached into the folds of his robe and pulled out a small, obsidian capsule‚Äîglowing faintly, impossibly.

‚ÄúThis is the black pill of truth,‚Äù he said, pressing it to my lips. ‚ÄúSwallow it, and know.‚Äù

I did. Instantly, the world cracked open‚Äîmemories, regrets, illusions peeled away like old paint. I saw my father's pain as a boy. I saw my own future, flickering. I saw the loops. The recursion. The lie of choice.

Saint Hamudi leaned in and whispered, ‚ÄúIt was over before it ever began. Tell them. Across every stream and valley‚Äîtell them.‚Äù

And then he vanished. Just‚Ä¶ gone. The water returned to its stillness. The crocodiles retreated.

I clawed my way to a slippery outcrop and pulled myself out, soaked and shivering. My father stood above with a rope and no expression.

‚ÄúYou climbed out,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMeans you‚Äôre not weak.‚Äù

I never forgave him. But I never feared anything the same way again, either. And I remembered Hamudi‚Äôs words. I‚Äôve been spreading the message ever since, in coffee shops, online forums, graffiti on tunnel walls: **It was over before it ever began.**

Recently however, I had noticed bloating around my upper abdomen, it‚Äôs not painful but can be a little uncomfortable, i also noticed bowel movements occasionally  getting very loose and sometimes it seemed as if it was just straight bile. The symptom i‚Äôm most concerned about is the upper left quadrant pain, i‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a 2/3 on a scale of 1-10 but can be uncomfortable. It comes and goes, not everyday and mostly at night. It is nothing in comparison to a gallbladder attack but as someone who has a history of health anxiety (especially related to that region after living with a swollen gallbladder for two months) I am really concerned it could be pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. i‚Äôm in between doctors but have an appointment set up for next month, I was hoping for some advice or insight anyone had to get me through with my anxiety until i get to see my doctor :) ",1,1747794948.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False
1krn4l7,https://i.redd.it/z249o0rir12f1.jpeg,"Bitterness, Beauty, and Plath","There‚Äôs a kind of holy violence in reading Ariel first thing in the morning. There‚Äôs something strangely devotional about it. I sit in silence and Plath whispers in that sharp, silver voice of hers. Not a whisper, really. More like a spell. A slicing.

I‚Äôve been starting my mornings lately with Ariel open on my lap and a chipped mug of coffee in my hands... no sugar,  just bitterness and heat and Plath.

Reading Ariel in the morning feels like being flung headfirst into cold water. You emerge breathless, a little stunned, but painfully aware of your own skin. Her words aren‚Äôt meant to soothe
... they awaken. ‚ÄúThe dew that flies / Suicidal‚Äù clings to your throat long after you close the book.

There‚Äôs something about her velocity, her momentum. She doesn‚Äôt linger. She devours. And yet there‚Äôs such strange, crystalline beauty in the wreckage she leaves behind. Her poems don‚Äôt explain themselves. They demand to be felt.

And maybe that‚Äôs why I keep returning to them at the break of day, when the body is still soft with sleep and the mind hasn‚Äôt yet built its armor. Her voice cuts clean through.

I know some people start their mornings with meditation, with calm, with clarity. I start mine with Sylvia. With wild metaphors and the taste of metal and sky. With fury, fragility, and a little bit of fire in my chest.",13,1747794881.0,Indianbooks,2,1.0,False

1krn1of,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1krn1of/i_conquered_my_anxiety_and_now_i_dont_have/,I conquered my anxiety and now I don‚Äôt have emotions,"I used to be anxious and overly emotional. Everyday occurrences were loaded with sentimental attachments, deep significance, longing, joy, pain - I would routinely get choked up from a 15-second commercial on TV or a brief interaction with a stranger. My emotions would run high at the anticipation of wearing a new pair of shoes, of going to a new coffee shop. I understood most people didn‚Äôt get quite as worked up about small everyday occurrences like I did. 


For better and for worse, I was frequently overwhelmed throughout my day to day life by the enormity and emotional weight of nothing at all. 
It was a frustrating way to live and it was exhausting. But I also really treasured my connection to my memories, my feelings and my connection to some existential mystery which felt both burdensome and pleasant at the same time

As I‚Äôve gotten older I‚Äôve found that my emotions are almost nonexistent. I still respond to basic stimuli - things still feel good and bad - but the deeper emotional richness of excitement, melancholy, elation, terror, envy, awe, wonder, yearning, bliss - those states are all left behind and it‚Äôs hard to remember what they really felt like. 

My memory has also gotten horrible. I think I used to catalogue my experiences by the emotions they made me feel. Now that I don't experience those feelings anymore and I can't really remember how they felt, my brain isn't able to file away new memories or recall old memories like it used to. 

But life is much easier now. I'm able to take on new challenges better, I take better care of myself, I embarrass myself less, I can prioritize things more effectively, I don't get hung up in analysis paralysis and I don't get lost in circular thinking. I just do whatever I think needs to be done. 

I‚Äôve got a family now. I feel responsible for their well being every single day. I think subconsciously I believe I can‚Äôt afford to have the highs and lows of intense emotions because I can‚Äôt afford to be under their influence and have it impact me negatively. 

I also think it‚Äôs related to my phone addiction. I listen to podcasts all throughout the day while working and then a lot of scrolling when I get home. I‚Äôm having a hard time unplugging. 

I feel like the only way to get my emotions back would be to either take like 2 months off of work and go on a road trip by myself or to take psychedelics again. I‚Äôm not in a position to do either. Psychedelics make me depressed and schizo and I can't go travel solo cuz I'm a dad with young kids

1krmzb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1krmzb4/brain_cake/,Brain Cake,"‚ÄúThese may be the final words I write, for after dusk I‚Äôm uncertain of what my fate will become. I know what roams out there, what it yearns, it will not have it. These entries have been the only place for me to record what has been happening. I‚Äôve recorded it‚Äôs every move, its patterns, I know now. But still, after everything I‚Äôm uncertain; it knows more about me than I do about it. Yet still, tonight I slay it.‚Äù

This was the last thing my granddad left before his disappearance. I flipped over the wrinkled stained paper, observing my granddad‚Äôs signature on the back, ‚ÄúHubert Davis‚Äù. I looked back up at my dad confused. He returned the gaze with a look of worry and anguish in his face, although he quickly choked it back and covered it up.

‚ÄúSon, what do you make of it?‚Äù He said it firmly, yet I could tell he genuinely wanted my feedback.

‚ÄúWhat even is this?‚Äù It was odd, he had given me the eerie ramblings of our granddad seemingly out of the blue.

‚ÄúWell, you and me both know my pops kinda lost it before the whole incident. I was thinkin‚Äô maybe you got something to pitch in.‚Äù

I looked back down at the writings on the paper. It was odd, yet nothing I wouldn‚Äôt have expected from an old man losing his marbles. The strangest thing of all of this was my dad giving me this. The doctors already said it; we both knew granddad had been suffering hallucinations and seeing things as the tumour developed. So why then give me this paper reaffirming things all these years later?

‚ÄúSon, do you really think a tumour would do all that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, uh‚Ä¶ probably. I‚Äôm no doctor or anything dad. Why are you even bringing all this up?‚Äù

My dad seemed to stare past me as he reclined back in his chair, butting out his cigarette in the dark stained ash tray. He took a deep breath, letting out a small sigh before looking back at me.

‚ÄúSon, have you ever thought about what he meant? I mean his ramblings, they droned on, yet there was always something he kept focus on.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? What like a- ‚Äú

‚ÄúNo, listen for a second boy, hush.‚Äù

There was a long and tense pause as we both sat in the warm living room. The rain tapped the roof of the farmhouse as my dad hunched forward in his chair and I waited in baiting anticipation. I could see his eyes darting across the room, the couch, the window, the door, the window, the shelf, the window. It startled me really, so I turned back to maybe catch what he was trying to find. Couch, window, door, window, shelf, window.

‚ÄúSon, why don‚Äôt we both get some rest? It‚Äôs late now and we‚Äôve got some heavy liftin‚Äô to catch up on tomorrow.‚Äù

I turned back to my dad; he looked at his watch as he stumbled himself forward and up out of the reclining chair. I got up from my seat and give him a firm hug before we both parted for the night. The way he acted had me worried, he was definitely hiding something. The whole interaction had uneased me, but I quickly settled down to prepare for bed.

I was down in the kitchen by myself grabbing a glass of water to bring back up to bed. The cold glass of the cup in my hand as I walked to the sink, feeling every rough spot in the floor. Outside still, the rain poured onto the farmhouse. I thought to myself, ‚ÄúThe crops are gonna be drinking well tonight.‚Äù I came to the sink, feeling the drowsiness already taking over my body as I turned the old tap and let the water run. *Pat-pat-pat-pat.* The rain came down as I watched the glass fill. *Pat-pat-pat-pat-pat.* Halfway full, my gaze trailing away from the glass and out the window. *Pat-pat-pat.* I looked out the kitchen window overlooking the front yard. *Pat-pat-SLAM!* Something I couldn‚Äôt see banged into the glass of the window in front of me. The sound sent me tumbling backward, dropping my nearly full glass of water onto myself. I looked up at the window from the floor to see a large shadow in the window before the loud crash of the glass shattering on the floor startled it away.

My dad was quick getting to the kitchen after hearing all the commotion. ‚ÄúWhat is it son?‚Äù my dad commanded as he charged into the kitchen with a wooden bat uplifted. ‚ÄúI-I could have sworn that I saw, uhm... something in the window. It was too dark to see what, and it hit the glass.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have seen it. And I know what it yearns.‚Äù

‚ÄúWh- dad what are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúGo to your bedroom and rest now. I will stay up and ensure that nothing happens anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut, what, I can‚Äôt just leave you.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is fine‚Ä¶ you-, Brent, son. I am fine just here.‚Äù

Something was different about him than earlier back in the living room. He was no longer acting strange, he was confident, he was ready. He kept the bat lifted, ready, his face was expressionless.

‚ÄúInside of my room you will find tucked in the night stand a key, I want you to have it.‚Äù He simply looked forward as he said this, unwavering in his stance. ‚ÄúIt is a key to uh‚Ä¶ uhm, a box.‚Äù He trailed off as he remained still. I didn‚Äôt argue, it was all so bizarre. I passed my dad, his eyes were cloudy, and his body looked relaxed yet still kept that defensive pose. He said nothing else, simply kept his blank stare aimed at the kitchen window. I wanted answers, what was happening? Why did he seem so different? I made my way up the creaking stairs and down the hallway. Into his room, right where he said was a rusted key. I took it and stuffed it into my pocket before a loud crash came from downstairs. I sprinted as fast as I could out the room, down the hall and stairs to the kitchen, yet he was gone.

It‚Äôs fifty years later now. I have a family, a career, and the keys to that old farmhouse. I recollect that night near vividly, and I haven‚Äôt seen my dad since despite the extensive investigations to find him. I rummage through my leather handbag, tossing aside pill bottles and junk as I dig for the keys to the farmhouse. I feel the dirty brass as I grab a hold of the keys from the bottom of my bag and pull them out. The keys are cold, with scratches and wear suggesting its use.

I take a step out of my car and begin my way up to the farmhouse. *Step‚Ä¶ Step‚Ä¶ Step‚Ä¶* Halfway up the front lawn and I can see the wear of the farmhouse. It‚Äôs been left here for many years now; abandoned ever since the night my dad vanished. *Step‚Ä¶ Step‚Ä¶ Step‚Ä¶* Making my way up onto the porch steps. The creak and snap of old and rotten wood shrieks as I lightly put my foot down onto each step. The front door is covered in peeling paint and scratches. There are several shattered windows with fauna growing out of them. *Step‚Ä¶ Step‚Ä¶* I swing open the front door easily. I‚Äôm not even sure why I thought I would need the keys for this rugged old place. I explore the nostalgia of a liminal yet familiar home, I begin recollecting the memories of my childhood and early adult years spent here. I recall a memory with granddad before his diagnosis. I was thirteen‚Ä¶ maybe fourteen at the time and we were in the living room talking about life. I remember a story he told me; his face changed to a puzzled look as he began looking around the room and began to speak to me.

‚ÄúBrent, do you know where granddad put his glasses?‚Äù I remember him having trouble with memory at this point in time. We both quickly found them; they were next to him on the coffee stand.

‚ÄúBrent, there was a time where I uh‚Ä¶ a time that I had no care for the world at all. All of my experiences, the past, I kept it behind me. But soon, Brent, you‚Äôll wish they could always stay. Cherish it.‚Äù It always stuck with me those words. I remember them specifically as it was one of the last times I got to see my granddad before he passed from that heart attack.

I investigate the living room, unsure of what exactly I am looking for. In the reclining chair my dad used to always sit in I could see the fresh outline of a person in the chair, silhouetted by the old dust. Nobody should have been here, this place hasn‚Äôt been in use for a long time. Who‚Äôs been living in the farmhouse? Whoever, somebody has been here, it made me uneasy. I peeked around the corner to the stairwell, the moonlight peering onto the stairs from a small window. I observe my surroundings; cold, isolated, and eerie. It feels as if it‚Äôs a new place I‚Äôve never been, but that couldn‚Äôt be right.

I begin making my way up the stairs when I hear something. I take a pause and listen for a second, trying to comprehend what I‚Äôm hearing. It sounds like‚Ä¶ it sounds like something‚Äôs walking downstairs. An animal? Or worse, an intruder? I turn my head to the source of the noise; it‚Äôs in the living room. Were they watching me the whole time? I keep looking, preparing myself, adrenaline and fear begins to rush in my mind as my breathing goes heavy. The steps get closer, moving in like a snail as my body stiffens. I hear them, no, it‚Äôs not a person, I hear it call out, ‚ÄúBreeent, where are you?‚Äù It‚Äôs voice is terrible, it sounds like a hundred voices into one. I see it‚Äôs hand come writhing around the corner, gripping the wall as it begins pulling its own weight in through the doorframe.

I bolt immediately up the stairs and down the hall like lightning. Behind me I hear the voice continue to call my name, it‚Äôs taunting me it knows more about me than I do of it. I knock down a picture frame in my rush, glass crashing as it hits the floor. I hear that monster pulling itself up the stairs as it pants out my name. I run into the closest room, I grab the nearest heavy object and push it in front of the door. It‚Äôs making its way down the hall now, the calling of my name replaced with a hyena‚Äôs cackle and the howl of a pained beast.

The lights in the room are already on, looking around I can‚Äôt recognize any of it but I know I‚Äôve been here, I‚Äôve had to it‚Äôs my house. I begin scavenging the room, anything to fight the monster that‚Äôs now banging on the door. It calls out my name, ‚ÄúBrent dearie what‚Äôs gotten into you?‚Äù The voice of a woman calls from the other side of the door, concerned. I feel as I know the voice, despite having never heard it before. I look under the bed, behind spilled boxes of Aricept and wrinkled, stained papers is my dad‚Äôs old bat. I pull it out and take my stance behind the box. The box? I remember, my dad needed me to see in there. In there, what is there? I know what I have, I have it for the box. I take it out, rusty, and open the box. Papers, checkup reports, pills. There it is my granddad‚Äôs final note after all these years. The lights turn off as I grab the paper, plummeting me into the darkness. I stare, looking, I‚Äôm seeing it. I see it, his writing, the signature, ‚ÄúHubert Rich‚Äù. I sit in the darkness, it‚Äôs darker than dark. The void. Beyond the door the woman still calls my name. The void sings to me, a familiar tune, my favourite song. What‚Äôs the paper? Where am I? The door is open now, the darkness surrounding me as the monster embraces me. I can see it, I know what it yearns. I know now.",1,1747794422.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

So, for those that totally disagree with my thought, which cafe do you reliably get a good drink from?

So, getting older is not without it's challenges. Wear and tear on the body. Love, loss, death, laughter, tears. Car accidents. Being chased by armed pimps. Various ailments popping up on your journey to the end of your time on this mortal coil. 

The last one is what I would like to talk about. 

My day started much like any other day. Alarm at 5:30 a.m.
Take care of them hekkin doggos, immediately. 
Coffee.
Dressed.
More coffee.
Drive.
Clock in.
More coffee.
Fuck off and get paid.
You get the picture. 

However the past 2 days have been different in one very important way. 

I HAVEN'T POOPED. Hot wings, ghost pepper chips, fiesta chicken casserole. And no action.  

Well after work I go get some Big T's Bbq, take some muscle relaxers and get ready to shower. As I give a rib bone to Luna I feel gassy. I decided to cut loose since my lady was in the other room. I gambled and lost. 

What I had assumed was your run-of-the-mill, garden variety flatulence was actually a pivotal moment in my existence. 

As I relaxed my sphincter to casually allow the gas to pass without much fanfare, what I can only describe as a grapefruit sized ball of molten feces found it's way out.

As I felt the sudden presence of solid matter wherein only a fart should be present, I attempted to slam my sphincter but alas, I was too late. The sudden pressure of matter accompanied by the hot, wet squish assured me....I had sharted.

Panic was instantaneous. I leapt to my feet, lest the contact of feces to cotton turned my underpants into a colonic Armageddon. Much to my chagrin, I was at the furthest point in my house from my commode.

With steely resolve, I had determined to handle this matter with as much poise and grace possible. However as I begin my sobering journey to my salvation, my girlfriend makes requests of me. I am hardly aware of the content of these requests. I just need to get clean.

I had vastly underestimated the volume of contents from this malignant shart. Every step, every twitch, every attempt to get closer with cleanliness pushes me further into my own mire. It pushes and squishes out omnidirectionally. It is staining my very existence. 

I finally make it to my bathroom, grab the wipes and begin to clean up....or so I had thought. Working blind, I reach back to start wiping away my sin, only to have it streak my hand. I am getting frustrated at this point.

Then I feel a bubbling. I instinctively sit on the toilet and become acutely aware that my posterior is basted in my own hatred. It is too late. I resign myself to cleaning the toilet before showering.  

Now at this point I understand that when a prescription pill bottle say: May Cause Diarrhea,  what it is actually saying is that by ingesting their poison you are agreeing to summon a balrog from the bowels of the Absu and into the bowels of mankind. 

What happened next was the shame of 10,000 years. As I let go with every fiber of my being the freshly summoned shit demon asserts his will by forcing my body to attempt ejecting all of my major organs in alphabetical order through my treasonous mud pussy.

After a few highly productive heaves, and having my ass flaps speckled in a fresh spackling of errant feces, I feel empty and hollow. I feel as though an entire Thanksgiving meal for 12 has left my digestive tract. I begin the process of cleaning the toilet and forgiving myself. 

I put on Pandora and plan on drifting off wherever the music takes me. As I begin the act of cleansing this barren flesh I get that familiar bubbling again. I stiffen.

I am caught between attempting to exit and land on my toilet without turning my bathroom into a scat/snuff scene or swallowing my pride and putting a hot dagger into what remains of my porous dignity. I choose the latter. 

I will spare the traumatic details. It is too soon. 

As I resume a thorough sandblasting of my flesh it occurs to me that I had recently purchased a new black&gold body poof for football season. I surely cannot sully these colors.I  look for an old poof......success! 

So now I  sit here, traumatized, weary of farts, yet clean.
