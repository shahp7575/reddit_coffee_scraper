My mom and I love your videos, I listen to you like an audiobook while I do chores around the house or whenever I go for a run. You've kind become part of my daily routine, hopefully that's not too weird to say, but thank you for that lol. Even my husband recognizes your voice now when he hears it, “Oh you're listening to Charlotte again?” It's kinda an inside joke between us now.

Okay, so this is a story that I've remained silent on for 11 yrs, and I finally think it's time to share. Throwaway account just incase, I know all parties in this story lurk reddit. I apologize in advance because this will be a really long one but I'll try to cut out the fluff.
 
For some context, this family feud began with my parents and the rest of the family which later would extend to the interactions between my siblings, myself, and our cousins. The story of the initial fallout is not mine to share, but maybe one day I can convince my mom to post it as it is even more scandalous and crazy than my own. Now, there were periods while growing up where this was not the case and every familial relationship involved was at least cordial. Fast forward to my later teenage years and this is where the clusterfuck began. 

I have a large family. Now mind you, for whatever reason, most of my cousins are female including me and my sisters so there was a lot of estrogen all in one place at one time, there are 25 full-blood related cousins. Only 5 are male. Maybe this is what lead to a sense of competition from a lot of the women in the family, whatever the reason, the older we got- there was competition. 

My oldest cousin, let's call her Lilith, and I had a very on-and-off relationship. I always thought she was cool, especially because she went to a private boarding school for HS and seemed to be living my Zoey 101 fantasy. But Lilith had a bad habit of being two-faced and being young and naïve, I didn’t realize this and often excused it. My mom, however, caught on very quickly and was having none of it. Though she never shut Lilith out completely, she made it clear that she wouldn’t entertain any of Lilith’s games. Which, oddly enough, only made Lilith attached to my mom more.

This would be the first issue my sisters and I had with Lilith. Every interaction, if it involved my mom, felt as if Lilith was trying to steal.. our mom? That sounds so stupid to say, but it is exactly what she was doing. She quite literally would get upset if our mom treated us like her daughters. We expressed this concern to our parents, but it wasn't until one particular day when my mom caught Lilith visibly sneer when she went to pick us up from school, that she fully believed us. It wasn't just with our mom either, this extended to our dad as well. You know the bond with fathers and daughters is very strong, at least it is between my sisters and I and our dad. We're all daddy's girls and not ashamed to admit it. Well, Lilith didn't like this. I guess it made her feel left out? If my dad was in the room and she wanted attention, she would quite literally “faint"" and no, she wasn't truly fainting nor did she have a medical condition, she just wanted attention. The first few times, everyone was concerned with her sudden fainting spells. But one time in particular, she went too far and claimed she had twisted her ankle and needed my dad to carry her, and fainted on the way to the nearest sitting area. Let it be known that you should never fake an injury or sickness in front of practicing nurses and doctors, because they will call you out. And call her out they did.

Despite all this, we accepted her into our inner circles. In spite of my mom's constant cautioning, my sisters and I did the teenage thing and began getting even closer to Lilith. To be fair, she love-bombed us. She picked us up from school, took us to the mall, and fully integrated herself into our schedules so that we would be together. At this point, we were pretty much inseparable and considered her to be more of a sister than a cousin. We started hanging out with her even more in my junior year of HS and did our best to mesh her into our social groups despite the age difference, (my identical twin and I were 17, my youngest sister was 15, and Lilith was 20). 
Lilith had no friends in the area, and was looking for work with little to no success. Which is where we had our first major red flag. Pulling our connections with our friend group and church family, we were able to help get Lilith into a great company. Mind you, it wasn’t the highest-paid position, but there was and still is endless oppertunities to climb up. (That I’m aware of, she makes a very decent living now.) 

Initially, we thought Lilith would be ecstatic with her new job, and for a time she was. We hung out like usual, but the hangouts began to lessen until at one point she completely ghosted us. Calls went unanswered, fb dms were left on read, and even her instagram feed had been wiped of almost all our interactions together, pics included. In addition to that, my sister and I were prepping to work and were invited to apply at the same company. What we didn't know at the time, was that the position that Lilith held at the company was the hiring center. Essentially, she stonewalled us out of the jobs and blacklisted our resumes. The betrayal hurt like a bitch. 

It was then that my sisters and I realized that she had used us the whole time just to get work only to then turn around to make it so that we could never access that same resource for that particular company. As long as she worked there, we would not be. Little did we know that it wouldn’t stop there.

Fast-forward a year, and Lilith makes a sudden reappearance and wants to hangout like nothing ever happened. I confronted her and let her know that I didn't appreciate being used and thrown away like trash after she got what she wanted from us. That we had gone over a decade without speaking to each other before, and it wouldn't hurt to continue to do so again if she was going to continue to act bitchy and then play the victim. Oddly enough, she apologized and swore she would never hurt us again. My sisters and I forgave her, because again- fAmILy – but the relationship was strained. 

We hung out very sparingly at this point, but I was more suspicious of her than anything else. I began to watch her closer and started to notice how strangely she would act around the guys from school and even church, especially with the guys she went to boarding school with. She was oddly… possessive. For example, let's say that she had texted them and for whatever reason they decided not to answer for an hour, maybe not at all? Instant temper tantrum, attitude, pacing the room and grumbling under her breath. Psycho. But at this point it wasn't to such an extreme that it occurred for long periods or happened consistently enough to be a major concern, for most people. It was like her mask would slip and if she got caught, she would simply slip the mask back on. Add to the fact that Lilith is extremely innocent looking, attractive, and pulls off this damsel-in-distress act… l was greatly concerned. For whatever reason, most people bought the act. Especially those of the male persuasion. 

One time I was on skype with a classmate and his gf to finish a group assignment, and my cousin literally pushed me out of the way to speak to him. His gf was not pleased and I was extremely embarrassed/forced to laugh it off and pretend like nothing was amiss. It created an awkward president that I tried to avoid whenever possible. Even worse, Lilith started adding all the people from our HS to her fb. I confronted her and told her how weird this was for us , especially considering how my twin and I were horribly bullied in school. Something that Lilith was painfully aware of as we had expressed our woes to her many many times. Of course she brushed it off and said that these were just “mutuals” and that we were the ones being weird for not allowing her to have her own friendships. I agreed that yes, of course she could be friends with whomever but she never actually met most of these people and it felt like she was going through our friends-list poaching our friends. I even addressed how hurtful it was that she had added a lot of the people that we were bullied by. Instead of being apologetic, she told us how nice these people were and asked if we were sure we had gotten the right people. Really? As if I could ever forget the faces of our bullies. One does not forget the people that smash food into your face, pour milk on your head, cut your hair, or throw cheap punches at you when you're not looking. Again, she brushed it off and said she'd delete them if it bothered us that much. But I knew she wasn't being honest, and in a passive-aggressive form of retaliation, my sisters and I hid our friendslist. She never deleted anyone, but she also lost access to anyone else we were connected to. 

It came to a head when we invited a large group of friends to church a few months later. We did this often and my parents encouraged this. Church was also the only place where Lilith shared actual mutual acquaintances and “friends,” but there was only a handful of them and most of them didn't have the free time to entertain her.  
For anyone who would come to church with us (we never forced this, just left it as an open invitation), we would make it like a family day—church, then lunch provided by us, and sports/activities throughout the afternoon and most times even dinner. We encouraged everyone who came to wear what they felt most comfortable in, and ensure that not one of them was ever left alone or left out of anything. It was cool and everyone always enjoyed themselves (I only know this for certain because they would tell us, and years later still reach out to tell us that they remember these days fondly). My parents, especially my mom, were always involved with the youth and young-adults in church so many of my friends, family, and church-family view/viewed them as their second parents (Lilith included). And would often give our friends, youth, and young-adults the listening ear/advice they may not have received at home. Ask my mom or dad now if this is the case and they'll deny it because they're way too humble, but many people view them as mom and dad. 

To this day, some of my most cherished memories are from that time in my life. 

As usual we invited friends to church, but oddly enough, this group would be the largest group of confirmed friends from school that would be attending, about 25. Somehow or another, Lilith caught wind of this and made a fb-group message saying that she hadn't been invited to the activities and was curious as to where her invite was. The peer pressure of her calling us out, despite not wanting her to be involved, my sisters and I felt we had no other choice but to extend her an invite. After this uncomfortable fb message, we decided to consult our mom. At first she was neutral, saying we shouldn't be exclusive as it wasn't the Christian thing to do and wasn't a good example to our friends. But after showing her the evidence of everything we could prove, she quickly changed her tone and advised us to warn our friends of Lilith's behavior just in case. Because of this, my sisters and I discussed with of our friends—the guys specifically, how Lilith tended to be around guys in general. Maybe that was an asshole thing to do and maybe it wasn’t, but after knowing these guys for most of our youth I thought it was owed to them to at least offer an explanation. 

We had a private discussion with everyone invited, not all at once but individually, and it seemed everyone was on the same page. In fact, there was a group of brothers and sisters that were particularly thankful because they came from a very conservative background of pastors and wanted no part in that behavior. Come the day, everyone showed and we all had a great time. Everyone was on their best behavior for church service, the food was good, the conversation flowed, and it was great company. The only sourpatch in the group was, of course, Lilith.  

Lilith was not too pleased with the seemingly cold shoulder she was getting from our friends. They weren't overtly rude or exclusive, but they were a little short with her through the service and lunch. It did not help that she behaved exactly as we warned she would. The only one in the group that enabled the behavior was the older brother of the large family of brothers and sisters that we had invited. Which was.. a surprise to say the least. After lunch, we had planned a soccer game at a local soccer field with a hiking trail just across the way. After the soccer game, if we all felt up to it, we had planned to play flashlight tag and then break for dinner and a movie.  

Now there is one detail I haven't added yet, I invited a guy that I was interested in, let's call him Adam. Adam was almost 20, so close in age to Lilith, only a few months younger. I met him in one of my college classes during my senior year of HS and hit it off. I know that sounds weird, but in the state I lived, there was (maybe still is) a program that allows a HS student to attend college while still enrolled in HS. There’s a lot of paperwork and standards that have to be met to do this, but if accepted into the program, the credits would count towards both a HS and college diploma. Remember, my twin-sister and I were extremely bullied in HS to the point of being forced to hide in the library everyday, so I said ‘fuck it, and fuck them,' and told my parents I couldn't do it anymore. We applied for the program, and senior year, we were at the college campus instead of the HS campus. We were successfully dual-enrolled. 

Lilith also contributed to this decision. How? Well I'm glad you asked. Rumors began to spread throughout the school and somehow spilled into our church, that I was pregnant. I only found out because there had been a college party where one of the younger siblings of the host had begun talking about “the twins.” My name was brought up, and it was claimed that I was not at the HS because of an unwanted teenage pregnancy. Considerations of the guys I had slept with was thrown around, and apparently someone claimed to have been a person or known a person I had been with, which is all bullshit because I was a virgin. Regardless, at 3 a.m. one morning, I was ripped out of bed by my mom who showed me the message of this guy and all the accusations that were being thrown at me. Sadly, there were always rumors floating about us in school, none of them true, but it does start to tear you down. These were different though, they were the most malicious rumors I had seen about myself so far. I only barely recognized the guy who even sent the message. We had only interacted a few times, but my mom knew him and his mom from church and that's what made his message all the more alarming to her. He explained what happened at the party and claimed that he defended me and swore that I would never behave that way. That it must all be a lie. Whatever else was said made him feel so awful that he left the party early and immediately reached out to make my parents aware of the situation. Especially because I was still a minor at the time. My mom being my mom, of course, was furious and concerned and confused. It was only some time later that I was made aware of who started the rumor.  

It was Lilith. 

For this reason, I kept my interest in Adam a secret to everyone. But during the soccer match, it was obvious that we were flirting with one another. Lilith was the first to notice, and refused to stop commenting on it to the point she wanted to trade teams because it wasn't fair for Adam and I to be on the same team. Apparently. Infuriatingly, Adam agreed. Of course I was irritated, but trying to be a good sport, I switched sides and finished the game opposite him. Lilith then switched her attention from the oldest brother of my friends, we'll call him Seth, and directed it fully onto Adam. Of course this left me feeling disgusted with a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. And the atmosphere of the group changed quickly with the charged energy coming off of Lilith, Adam, Seth, and me. 

Lilith opposed the rest of the plans for the night, including dinner, and instead insisted on of plans of her own. Half of the company wanted to change (most of them being Seth and his family—he was their ride) and the other half didn't want to change plans. Lilith began telling everyone that the plans we had originally were stupid anyway and we should do something else that we could all enjoy. Adam and the other half of the company said they were happy with the events of the day and didn't want to sour the occasion by fighting. Lilith was having none of this. She grabbed her keys and began walking off towards her car. Of course Seth went after her to calm her down and at that point the vibe was completely ruined for everyone else. My sisters and I began doing damage control and offered to accommodate by asking if everyone was okay changing plans to go to eat where Lilith had suggested, just to keep the peace. 

At this point, Seth and Lilith come back and Lilith announces to everyone that anyone who wishes to join her should meet her at the movies. Send her a text and they'll figure everything else out once they're there. She then turns and asks Adam directly if he wants to go. I look at Adam and Adam looks at me nervously before responding slowly, “Sure.”  Then in front of everyone, Lilith hands Adam her phone number and leaves. 
As angry as I was at that moment, I didn't cause a scene or do anything that I would regret later. Adam offered to take me home and my sisters caught a ride with our other friends. It was at this point when we were alone that I shared with him everything Lilith had done to me and my sisters up to this point. I made it clear how I felt about her, that despite us being family, I didn’t trust her and that she had a tendency to do this to us. She would pop up when she wanted or needed something and use us to get it. That this time, she wanted a boyfriend and that it was obvious she had set her sights on him. For the most part, Adam listened the whole time and waited to give his opinion until I finished. He reassured me that he was only interested in me and that he would take what I said into account but that he wanted to get to know me and my family better. At this I asked him if he was really going to meet her at the movies, and he responded by asking if I would be angry if he went. I said yes. 

To this Adam responded with disappointment, stating that I would regret allowing our relationship to grow cold if I continued this way. I told him I didn't know if I could pursue a relationship with him if he couldn't even trust me about my own family. To this he backtracked, but insisted everything would be fine because he was sure that Seth was more interested in Lilith anyway and that everything would be fine. Regardless, I insisted on not going and let him choose for himself what he would decide. 
He went. 

You would think that after this interaction, I would throw my attention elsewhere, but no. Young and dumb, that‘s what I was. Plus, I couldn't necessarily avoid Adam, I would see him at school in class. I still tried to avoid him, but to be honest I was crawling away hoping he would catch me. He did. He followed me on campus apologizing non-stop. Overtime, he broke down my defenses. He even showed me how Lilith had been messaging him nonstop on fb, through txt, and Instagram. At one point she had even asked him out, to which he responded with, “You know I'm interested in your cousin, right?” 

She responded, “You sure?”

So I asked him point blank if anything happened at the movies, and he explained that she had tried to kiss him but that he played it off and pushed her away. I don't know why, but I believed him. In front of me, he blocked her number and her socials and said he only hadn't done so earlier because he wanted to prove to me that he was still only interested in me. After that I went no-contact with Lilith and Adam and I began officially dating after my graduation. 

Immediately after we went official, Lilith began dating Seth. Sadly, any friendship my sisters and I had with Seth and his family dissolved into nothing. The last message I received was from the youngest sister and she was upset that we had lied about Lilith's character to the family. That they were disappointed with us for having warned them against such a sweet and kind person, especially after everything Lilith had done for us. I responded that I wished her brother and the family the best of luck, and apologized to her for the future hurt her brother was certain to face.  

Fast-forward two years, I'm 20 and Adam is now 22. Our relationship is rocky… shitty really, but that’s another story for another time. Lilith is 23  and newly single having been dumped by Seth a few months prior. She had been cheating, and from what I'm aware of, the family had an intervention with Seth over Lilith's treatment of him to help convince him that she was no good. Whatever they did/said to convince him worked because he ended things and cemented this decision by deleting her off of everything and reaching out to my sisters and myself. He sent one message that I never responded to, because what could I say?
It read: “I should have listened to you.”

I bring this up because again, my relationship with Adam was toxic and less than ideal. I was sure he had been cheating on me too (among other things), but didn't have enough concrete evidence to prove it. He had brought me to a point that I didn't even trust my own judgement, the gas-lighting and emotional abuse had taken its toll so much so that when I showed him this message from Seth one night he actually sided with Lilith. Then he tried to persuade me that I had been the one to overreact and ruined a relationship with a family member over nothing. I reminded him of how Lilith was, and that I thought Seth and I would have a better grasp on Lilith's character than he ever could. Still, Adam insisted on her innocence or if anything, that she deserved the benefit of the doubt. That I must be blinded by jealousy to be pushing the idea that she was a bad person, if anything I should be more like her. I wasn't even surprised when he said I should start dressing like her, because he had done this to me with other women too. Always subjecting me to comparisons and not so subtly suggesting I needed to be more like “so-and-so.” 

By this point in the relationship we were always fighting, so my disagreement with him over Lilith turned into a huge fight that resulted in us further separating from each other. For whatever reason, Lilith was a huge point of contention and I would poke and prod at it to try and force a reason out of him. Instead I was told that I was paranoid, jealous, and an overbearing gf. But one night when he was dropping me off at home after having hung out at his house, his phone went off. Now his phone had been a point of contention many times prior, because I had seen messages from other women popup that he always had an excuse for—“It's my co-worker,” “she’s my cousin,” “it's a classmate.” But this time, it clearly said, “Lilith.” 
I lost my shit.

Afterwards, we hardly saw each other, despite being right next door to each over on campus for school. Days would go by where I hadn't heard from him and I tried to act like it was all normal. Until he scheduled to hangout one weekend at the end of March. He wanted to make up for how crappy he'd been, take me out somewhere nice, have an enjoyable date together, reconnect. So I consented to the date that Saturday, and for once was excited thinking that maybe this time things would be different. He'd be sincere.

Saturday rolls around and I'm prepping in the early afternoon for mine and Adam's date. My uncle makes an unannounced visit to tell me that the unused bed he had in storage (he had previously promised to gift it to me as I was looking to purchase one for my room), he was giving to Lilith instead. He went on to explain that Lilith had just moved into a new apartment and that she had reached out to him to ask for help in furnishing her new place (my uncle was single at the time and very well off).  Whatever deal they made with one another wasn't my business, but it was apparent that he had given her the bed instead and wanted to be sure I wasn't upset with him. I told him that I wasn't and that I appreciated him letting me know so that I could change my plans to get one on my own. Despite him seemingly still upset about something, we hugged and then he left. 

MINUTES. Later. And I do mean minutes, there's a knock on the door and I open it only to be greeted to none other than Lilith herself. She's dressed very nice and seems subdued, mind you I'm still waiting for Adam to show for our date so I'm slightly irritated that she's even here. I do my best to play nice, wondering why the hell she would pop-up unannounced after having remained no-contact for the last 2 years, but I bite my tongue and wait for an explanation of what she wants. Admittedly, something was very off. I couldn't tell what, but it was like she was actively making a decision on something while silently sitting in front of me. My parents stayed in the room and acted like a buffer, but things were tense and nothing made any sense. My dad offered her coffee, to which she took, and still I waited. 

Half-an-hour of this passes until she decides that its time for her to leave, and she just sees herself out without an explanation or a reason of why she showed in the first place. She pulls out and drives off only for Adam to now pull in. Strangely, he doesn't come to the door to get me, instead he texts me that “he's here"" and to “come out to the car.” I run out, ignoring the disapproving glances of my parents, and tell them I'll be back later in the evening. I jump into the car, have enough time to close the door, before Adam quickly peels out of the driveway. I make a joke about him being a little too excited for the date to be so hasty in leaving while quickly clicking my seatbelt in, before noticing the chilly atmosphere in the car. 

I looked over and instantly regretted being alone with him. His expression was unlike anything I'd ever seen before, and he was eerily silent. Even the radio was turned off, and it was then that I noticed we were driving in complete silence. I asked him over and over if everything was okay, if something happened, had I done something wrong? But he wouldn't respond. We drove to the restaurant he had planned to take us to, but instead of parking at the restaurant he parked across the street and turned off the engine. 
I finally asked him what the hell was going on. All Adam responded was, “I want us to take a break for the summer. I have some plans and I want to have fun without you asking where I am all the time. So after the summer we'll get back together and everything will be fine. I just wanted to tell you that, because I already decided it.” 

What Adam did not expect, was for me to agree with him. Only I told him that we should just go ahead and breakup completely if he wanted to take a break, because what he really wanted was permission to sleep with someone or maybe multiple someone’s. I didn't know what his plans were, but I was certain of one thing, a break is a breakup. I wasn't going to be more of a fool by actually allowing this to happen. I refused to be someone's second choice, let alone some type of layaway girlfriend.

Adam was not prepared for me to respond with a growing backbone. Because of this he responded by driving quite dangerously, almost hitting multiple pedestrians, and speeding quickly to his house and parking, again, across the street and not pulling into the house either. I kept asking him what the hell was going on, why had he even set this date if he never actually was going to take me on one. When he continued to offer no response, I begged him to at least let me go in the house to see his parents. I knew for a fact that they would give me a ride home because they adored me, and I just didn’t feel safe with him anymore. But without saying a word and that same stone-faced expression, he drove me back to my parents’ house and dropped me off acting as if nothing ever happened.

A month later, I broke up with him officially. He freaked out. Drove to my job, that I had to literally flee from because he was causing a scene. He almost hit a cyclist chasing after me as I drove off, and then begged me to reconsider in the front lawn of my parents house as my neighbors watched. After throwing everything he'd ever given me (to be fair it was honestly his parents gifts, he wasn't generous at all, but his parents pretty much thought of me as their daughter and were very liberal in their gift-giving) into his car. He swore that he would do anything to win me back, change to be the man I deserve, blah-blah-blah, and promised to get me breakfast in the morning as his first act of being worthy of me. 

The next morning before class, he barged into my professor's lecture and again made a scene only this time in a room of my peers. His heroic super awesome romantic changed man breakfast for me was a nutrition bar I had once seen underneath the front seat of his car months prior. So much effort. After trying to force me to make out with him in the front of the class, some of the men in class took it upon themselves to forcibly expel him from the room. Needless to say, I was mortified, I wanted to disappear and my eyes were a swollen puffy mess. 
Church was only a few days later and I had decided that I wanted to stay home with my thoughts as I wasn't really up for the socialization and faking of pleasantries. Thank God I stayed home. 

My parents had texted me after the service to let me know that they would be visiting with my grandparents and would probably be having lunch with them. They asked if I was feeling up for the visit, and I told them no, and that I would see them later in the day. After the brief text convo I started cleaning the house only to freak out as a loud knock sounded at the door. I did the one thing everyone does when they don't want to see any guests—I crumpled to the ground like a house of cards and low-crawled to the nearest window to peak outside. 
It was Adam with flowers and a stack of letters. I refused to answer the door, my phone buzzing with messages from him all the while. “I know you're in there, please let me in so we can talk. Even if its for a few minutes.” After half an hour of this and the constant texts of him begging me to let him in, he gave up and left. It wasn’t until my parents came home that I realized that he'd left the flowers and letters. I didn't want them, not even the letters, so chucked them and allowed my mom to read the letters. 
Never did end up reading them, and never will. 

But if my heart hadn't already fallen out my ass when Adam showed up at the door, it fell all the way to the core of the earth when my mom pulled me aside in the living room to tell me that she had some bad news to tell me. She said that she had just had an upsetting conversation with my grandmother, who was hoping to tell me the situation herself. Apparently, Lilith had been communicating with Adam. She had appeared the day I broke up with Adam to ask my grandmother if she would be upset if Lilith had been comforting the ex of a friend. My grandmother had asked her who this friend was, and Lilith backtracked saying that it wasn't exactly a friend but maybe a family member. To which my grandmother point blank asked her if it was me, and if I had broken up with Adam. Lilith had responded, well, not exactly and that Adam had invited her over to his house. That she was only consulting him on how to win me back. 

Her strange visit the day of mine and Adam's last date suddenly came to mind. In fact, they were both acting very strangely that day, and it all just made perfect sense. At this point, I hadn't responded to one of Adam's messages, but I did choose at that time to tell him—“I know about Lilith.” 
This opened the floodgates to a ton of information. He claimed that it was Lilith that had reached out to him, in fact, she showed up to meet him at his work. She offered to help him win me back since she knew me so well, and she could tell him what to say. I asked him if he slept with her, but he adamantly refused that it ever happened. He did admit that he had gone over to her apartment a few times after work, “for advice.” I told him I knew he was lying and I knew that they did in fact sleep together. I told him it was disgusting how he had gaslit me every time I had said their relationship was off. That I had warned him about how I felt about her because I knew exactly how she was, and that she was only using him to hurt me, because that's how she's always been. Still, he defended her and said it wasn’t like that at all, that he was just hurting and that all Lilith was doing was offering him support. I told him that I had supported him long enough, and that he could have Lilith but he'd never have me. And that was the last text I sent him. 

Unfortunately for me, it didn't stop there. Thankfully, my whole family decided to skip church the following week along with me and instead go out on a hike and have our own worship service outdoors. Adam and Lilith had chosen that week to tell everyone in service that I had cheated on Adam—I never did—and during the whole service made a show of crying and mourning. Asking everyone how I could do such a thing to him, Lilith was at his side the whole time patting him on the back and offering support. They even went as far as to consult the elders and the pastor over my behavior, requesting that they speak to me to help me fix my moral compass. Thankfully, I had grown up in this church, was fully involved in it since I was a child. These people knew me very well, the elders and deaconesses did not believe one word out of either of them and instead made sure to make me aware of the situation immediately. Unbeknownst to Adam or Lilith, Adam was not very much liked by pretty much anyone. Lilith had also made a reputation for herself, having made some.. curious choices with other men in the past, at church. It also didn't escape anyone's notice that Lilith and Adam had come to church together, and that I had been noticeably absent the past two weeks.

Needless to say, the rumors spread regardless and people chose a side, it was pretty much inevitable. I made the decision not to defend myself by telling my side of the story, it was my story. If anyone wanted to hear it, or cared to know it, they would ask me. Besides that, I am of the persuasion that in these types of situations, the first person to say something is often the person who dealt the first blow, like Wickham from Pride and Prejudice. So, I kept my head held high, endured the rumors until they passed and lost the friendships of those who chose to believe the lie rather than the truth and keeping or gaining the friendships of the people who actually mattered. 

As for Lilith, she did herself no favors by sleeping with Adam. I never knew who she cheated on Seth with, if it was Adam or another man, but either way people began to realize she wasn't the girl she portrayed herself to be. As for the family, of course sides were chosen, again. With the exception of one aunt and one uncle, we pretty much distanced ourselves from that side of the family completely and sadly act like strangers. It's better that way, at least it stays neutral. 

Oddly enough, whether you believe in karma or not, God must have been smiling down on me. He gifted me the love of my life shortly after all of this happened, in fact it was Adam who encouraged me to talk to him in the first place. We had reconnected over a silly post on fb, and for some reason we just kept interacting periodically.  Adam saw my phone go off one night and asked who it was, having never hid anything from him, I gave him my phone and showed him my messages. When he asked who this guy was, I told him it was actually a boy who happened to be my first crush in kindergarten. Explained to him the whole story of how the first time I saw this boy I had proudly and confidently proclaimed that he would be my husband one day. Adam actually laughed and thought it was a stupid crush. I asked him if he was okay with me talking to—lets call him, Elliot.

“Do I mind if you talk to him? Of course not! Now you have someone to talk to and not annoy me,” were Adam's exact words. 

So with Adam's blessing, I continued talking to Elliot like he was my pen pall. What I didn't know was that he was my lifeline. It was all very sweet and innocent, so innocent in fact that my mom and sisters read all our messages. I even think my dad read them to a certain point. Our conversations were just nice, we spoke about politics, books, movies, games, everything. It was actually my parents that told me it couldn't go on this way. That I could either continue to stay with Adam and see how far we go together knowing full well that a future with Elliot would likely never happen. Or, I could let Adam go, and see if there was another future in store for me. 

Elliot and I have now been married 10 yrs, together 11. It was a whirlwind romance, and to this day it still feels like a dream come true. From the moment we started talking, it was like we had known each other all our lives. So I guess kindergarten me was right, he was my husband afterall.  

Lilith was not pleased with this drastic and sudden change. She was even less pleased by the fact that Elliot and I were engaged only seven months later. And in Lilith fashion, she had to compete. She dropped Adam almost instantly, and I'm sure that contributed to his cyberstalking over the last decade. So, it was a surprise to no one when Lilith announced shortly afterwards that she was also engaged. I cannot say for an absolute fact that Lilith didn't have feelings for her fiancé, but there were signs that all was not well in paradise. Elliot and I were married the following summer, Lilith was not invited, and for a time everything was quiet. 

Lilith announced that she was married mere weeks after us, and sported an impressive rock from her new husband. Only, karma must have caught Lilith too because she made the mistake of posting the wrong profile picture to all her socials not a few weeks after her and her husband's elopement. You see, Lilith was cheating on her new husband… with his best friend who served in another branch of the military. What she did not notice in her profile picture, was that the best friend had left the top of his uniform on the chair behind her, and his nametag was showing. Everyone saw. Her husband happened to be out of the country at the time and had already been suspicious of the pair of them. 
They were divorced quickly and quietly.

As for me and Lilith, I actually forgave her a few years later. Not that she asked me to, but I reached out to tell her I harbored no hard feelings or ill-will. She read the message and didn't respond, but I don't mind. Forgiveness is for the person offering it, not the person receiving it. Plus, I was done holding onto all that ugly, it was only making me ugly on the inside too. It seems the years haven't treated Lilith very well. She's made some choices that have led her down a rough path, and I do feel sorry for her. But not enough to circle back to that relationship ever again.

What should I do?,"I am a 25 year old man. 6'1, 183lbs. I don't take any psychiatric medications or any vitamin supplements or anything of that nature. I haven't been diagnosed with any mental illness and I am just starting to see a therapist for now.

This thing literally happened overnight when I didn't take any supplements. I had no history of mental illness. nobody in my family has mental illness as well. I don't have any head trauma or injuries or anything like that. I didn't take any kind of supplements or anything like that at all prior to this. I don't know why this is happening. I literally don't feel any orgasm at all or sexual attraction after ejaculation.

I realize that this mental block in my head is not only prohibiting my learning but other parts of my mind as well. I am struggling with satisfaction activities, even if they are low dopamine. I struggle with meditating, and I struggle with learning and focusing better. I struggle with being in the moment. I am so messed up and this is hard to explain a lot honestly. I really feel like my situation is hard to describe but it's just some weird altered state of my mind that's been tampered with and I do things out of nowhere. I don't feel the way I would usually feel when doing these activities and it just happens out of nowhere with no single negative thoughts about these daily things.

When I am learning things on my own or meditating or something like that, I am physically doing it but it's like I can't ""feel"" it. I am meditating and I can't ""feel"" like I am meditating. I am trying to learn and study but I am not ""feeling"" like I am doing it or like the process is going on. I just slept. 

I tried to drink a cup of coffee today and then I felt some effects of being alert for some time. After 25 minutes, the effects of being alert and cognitive improvement started to waver on and off. It later became diminished to a low point that I couldn't recognize it anymore. I later drank two cups of coffee and a red bull that was 16 ounces and I don't feel the hyper effects. I was feeling it after one cup of coffee this morning and I was feeling something. Then suddenly, I felt like the effects literally decreased randomly out of nowhere and it doesn't make sense because I haven't had coffee in years! I took the red bull and still feel nothing. This is tied to my situation of feeling diminished experiences out of nowhere. I feel like I literally woke up one morning and lost my sensations and my brain interprets everything differently now. It's likely the brain is failing to process the information about the world and what's happening around me. What are some ways to reverse this and go back to normal?

Water distiller vs Zero Water,"We have fairly hard water of around 275-300 TDS and I am getting tired of picking up distilled water from the store to make my own blend.  I use approximately 960-1280 daily for my coffee plus when my spouse uses distilled for humidifier in winter.  Tired of lugging in all the plastic bottles plus do not like all that plastic, even though it is recyclable for us.  I am trying to decide between a water distiller off Amazon or a Zero Water pitcher.  I have a Brita but of course that does nothing for my TDS or to reduce the scaling in my kettle.  My own blend of water never scales whereas my tap will start scaling within a day or two.

What are the pros and cons of either choice?  If going with the distiller I probably would get something like the Vevor with glass pitcher/carafe off Amazon.  Any input is appreciated.  Cost is less of an issue since in the long run all three choices are in the same ball park.

1ig8z5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1ig8z5q/my_review_of_the_delonghi_dinamica_non_plus/,My review of the Delonghi Dinamica (non plus),"I got this machine a month ago after doing lots of research, including reading reviews on this subreddit and here are my thoughts: 

1. My version is the 3535, the one with the steam wand that has a cappuccino option. The steam wand and the milk frother work very well, the only downside is that it gets very noisy after about 30 seconds to a minute of use. To have hot milk, you need to use it for about 30 seconds but if the milk is chilled then for about a minute or slightly longer, depending on the quantity and temperature of the milk. 

2. The coffee is strong, even on the weakest setting. The water quantities are quite small, so it's not really suitable for people who like large mugs of weak coffee. You can have up to 250 ml of drink per cup (just under 8.5 ounces). I use Arabica, so not the strongest of beans. 

3. The machine produced very good coffee from the start, I didn't have to ""dial it in"" or anything. 

4. The main downside is the lack of precision in the drinks personalisation options, you can't choose the exact millimetres of drink that you want, you just choose the strength (between 1 and 5) and then you press stop when you want it to stop pouring and the machine can save that quantity. 

5. I paid 384 euros for the machine, brand new, and even received some free coffee and glasses. Overall, I'm very happy because I don't really think that a better machine for a similar price exists!

He was the one to bring up a talk about what we’re looking for and said that he wanted a committed relationship and he thought I’m ’the one’ even though I didn’t ask. He was always asking me deep questions, making it clear that he was super into me, said that he deleted the app and not talking to anyone else and never mentioned any sexual stuff, only cute things and compliments. That went on for 5 days, we were supposed to have a date on Sunday, but on Saturday he said he couldn’t wait anymore and asked to meet me for a coffee in my area, just for 30 minutes to at least be able to hug me. 

We meet, sparks are flying everywhere, he’s all over me - hugging, touching, kissing my hands, cheeks, forehead, saying over and over how beautiful I am, how perfect I am, how happy he is. We discuss how our next date will go, what we’re going to do next week, family and friends, what are my favorite flowers, all seems to be going perfect, I feel like I’m finally about to be in a committed relationship with a good man! 

He walks me home, we’re all over each other, kissing, not being able to let go. I come home, he texts me that he already misses me.

Sunday morning he texts me as usual, being cute, saying that he still has my smell on him and stuff. He was supposed to pick me up after my dance class and I ask what time he’s going to come get me. He then disappears for 2 hours and then answers that he’s sorry and his coworker failed him and will not be able to cover for him. I read the messages and do not answer. He asks me what I am doing and then when I don’t reply he asks if I’m mad. I say that yes I’m upset. He disappears for 6 FREAKING HOURS, I get worried and ask if anything’s happened. 

He answers some time later that he’s had a super bad day at work and doesn’t respond to my messages anymore. I’m crying whole Monday and decide to text him on Tuesday and ask if he’s okay because he disappeared so abruptly and I’m worried. He replies, saying that he’s having problems at work and all this time his phone was on dnd and he didn’t talk to anybody. I try my best to support him and say nice things- to which he replies  politely but cold ‘thanks for your attention and support’. That’s it. He didn’t ask how I’m doing, nothing, and I haven’t heard from him since. I’ve been crying the whole week trying to figure out what went wrong. 

What did I do? If he didn’t like me, he wouldn’t say all this cute stuff during and after date, wouldn’t always try to touch me , wouldn’t make plans, right? I just don’t understand. I feel so lost because I fell in love with him. He still follows me on instagram, watches my stories, haven’t deleted the chat. If he really is having this rough period at work, he could’ve communicated that with me if he liked me, right?

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The allure of white barndominiums has captured the attention of many homebuyers and builders alike. These unique structures combine practicality with modern design, making them a popular choice for those seeking a stylish yet functional living space. White barndominiums, in particular, stand out with their clean aesthetic and versatile layouts.

One of the primary appeals of white barndominiums is their spaciousness. Featuring open floor plans, these homes maximize usable space, creating a sense of freedom and flow that many traditional homes lack. This openness can accommodate various living styles, from hosting family gatherings to creating defined areas for work or leisure. Here are some key aspects that make white barndominiums so appealing:

- **Versatile Designs:** You can personalize the layout of a barndominium to meet your needs. Whether you want an open-concept living area or more traditional separated rooms, the choices are plentiful.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Many barndominiums incorporate modern construction methods and materials, making them more energy-efficient. Proper insulation and energy-efficient windows can reduce utility bills significantly.
- **Durability:** Built primarily from metal or steel, white barndominiums are designed to withstand the elements. They require less maintenance compared to traditional wooden homes, providing peace of mind for homeowners.

The exterior appeal of white barndominiums cannot be overlooked. The striking contrast of bright white with natural surroundings creates an inviting atmosphere. Homeowners can enhance this aesthetic further by choosing complementary features, such as wooden accents, expansive porches, or stylish landscaping. This design not only allows for an inviting curb appeal but also provides a unique expression of personal style.

A significant advantage of white barndominiums is their potential for dual use. Many owners utilize part of the space as a workshop, barn, or even a business facility. This flexibility is ideal for those who enjoy hobbies or run businesses from home. By combining living and working spaces, you can save on commuting time and costs.

Another factor contributing to the rise of white barndominiums is their affordability. Compared to conventional homes, these structures often come with lower construction costs. The materials used in barndominium construction are generally less expensive, and the straightforward design can decrease labor costs. This affordability makes homeownership more attainable for many, opening doors for young families and first-time buyers.

Moreover, white barndominiums fit seamlessly into various environments—from rural landscapes to suburban communities. Their aesthetic appeal allows them to blend effortlessly with their surroundings while making a bold statement. Consider some popular features that enhance their look:

- **Large Windows:** These not only allow for natural light but also enhance the view of the outdoors.
- **Metal Roofs:** Offering durability and a modern edge, metal roofs complement the barndominium’s design.
- **Outdoor Living Spaces:** Many homeowners incorporate decks, patios, or outdoor kitchens that extend the living area and provide additional entertainment options.

When it comes to interior design, white barndominiums embrace a minimalist approach. White walls create a blank canvas, allowing homeowners to express their tastes through furniture, decor, and artwork. This simplicity fosters a calm and peaceful living environment, making it a comfortable space to unwind. Popular interior features include:

- **Open Beams:** Highlighting the spaciousness and industrial feel of the barndominium.
- **Concrete Floors:** Offering durability while presenting a sleek and modern appearance.
- **Farmhouse-Inspired Accents:** Elements like shiplap walls and rustic light fixtures add warmth and character.

As trends in home-building lean towards sustainability and functionality, the popularity of white barndominiums is likely to grow. With their blend of style, practicality, and cost-effectiveness, they present an attractive option for today’s discerning homeowners. Whether you're looking for a primary residence, a vacation home, or a multi-purpose property, consider the many benefits that white barndominiums offer. They truly represent a modern approach to home living.

Interior Design Ideas for Your White Barndominium: Maximizing Space and Aesthetic
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

White barndominiums have gained immense popularity for their spacious and versatile interiors, blending the charm of barn aesthetics with modern living. If you've decided to embrace this unique style, maximizing your space while enhancing aesthetics is key to creating a comfortable and inviting home. Below are some innovative interior design ideas that will help you transform your white barndominium into a stylish sanctuary.

### Choose the Right Color Palette

Since you're working with a white barndominium, the color palette can significantly influence the overall vibe of your space. Here are some strategies to consider:

- **Accent Colors:** Use soft pastels or bold hues as accents. Sage green, soft blue, or even deep navy can elevate your design while keeping a serene ambiance.
- **Natural Elements:** Incorporate wooden fixtures or furniture. Shades of honey or walnut wood create warmth against the white walls.
- **Texture Variety:** Introduce various textures through textiles like cushions, rugs, and throws, enhancing depth without overwhelming the space.

### Maximize Open Spaces

The open floor plan of a barndominium is a fantastic canvas for creativity. To make the most out of your space, consider these tips:

- **Furniture Arrangement:** Opt for furniture that encourages conversation and allows for easy movement. Circular or oval dining tables can promote flow.
- **Multipurpose Areas:** Designate specific zones for different activities. For example, use a corner for reading with a comfy chair and a small bookshelf, while another area serves as a workspace.
- **Minimalist Approach:** Embrace a less-is-more philosophy. This not only keeps the space organized but also emphasizes the beauty of your barndominium's architecture.

### Incorporate Natural Light

Utilizing natural light is crucial in such spacious environments. Here’s how to enhance illumination:

- **Large Windows:** Install oversized windows or glass doors that bring the outside in. This connection enhances both aesthetic and openness.
- **Reflective Surfaces:** Use mirrors strategically. They can create illusions of space and reflect light, making areas feel brighter.
- **Light Fixtures:** Choose stylish pendant lights or chandeliers that complement your theme. Soft, warm light can make your home feel cozy and inviting.

### Personalized Decor

Your white barndominium should reflect your personality and style. Personal touches can make a world of difference. Consider these ideas:

- **Gallery Wall:** Create a gallery of family photos or local artwork. The contrast of color and texture can provide a beautiful focal point.
- **Handcrafted Pieces:** Incorporate handmade items to instill uniqueness. Look for local artisans for furniture or decor that embodies your locality.
- **Greenery:** Use houseplants to infuse life into your space. Succulents or tall, leafy plants can add freshness and vitality.

### Functional Storage Solutions

With the expansive layout of a barndominium, clever storage solutions are vital. Here are some creative options:

- **Built-in Shelving:** Utilize vertical space by installing built-in bookshelves. These can also double as a way to display decor.
- **Under Furniture Storage:** Choose furniture that offers storage, such as ottomans with space for blankets or a coffee table with drawers.
- **Hooks and Racks:** Incorporate hooks for hanging hats, coats, or plants. This adds functionality without compromising style.

Embracing design elements that enhance the unique aspects of a white barndominium will yield a warm and inviting home. With these interior design ideas, you can maximize space while creating an aesthetic that is both stunning and functional. Remember, your barndominium can be as unique as you are, so let your imagination run wild as you decorate and personalize your space.

These unique structures seamlessly combine functionality with a chic, rustic aesthetic, making them an appealing choice for many homeowners. Their spacious interiors often boast open floor plans, allowing for creativity in design and optimization of living areas.

I was sitting outside the cafe enjoying some winter sunshine, waiting for my husband who went in to get the coffees, when a car of young men went past and one shouted “fat bitch” at me. 

I didn’t look up and just pretended I didn’t hear anything. I could feel my eyes stinging but I didn’t let the tears come. My instinct was to just go home, but I forced myself to finish my drink and try to enjoy being out for a change. 

I am disappointed to say I used food to comfort myself when I got home. 

I would love to hear how you handle situations like this. It blows my mind that people behave like this, but I still end up blaming/hating myself when it happens (which thankfully isn’t very often).",5,1738533024.0,SuperMorbidlyObese,4,1.0,False

1ig8oiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1ig8oiq/i_work_in_a_hotel_and_theres_something_odd_on_the/,"I work in a hotel, and there's something odd on the cameras. Part 1.","My name is Andrew, I’ve only worked here a few months, and one of the first things they taught me was to always keep my eyes on the cameras. You never know when something is going to pop up that you need to take notes on. Most of the time there’s nothing interesting, just people running to the pool, or getting ice, running to the gas station next door, or just leaving to go to the Applebees. Dollarita’s were back when I started so that’s where most people were. The first month flew by, simple easy, we don’t have a very large hotel, only 4 floors, and like 60 rooms. When I started, we had a lot of stay overs, and a couple of university teams. Essentially, only ever about 30 people in the hotel at a time. We also have a lot construction crews that stay with us while they work on site. 

Most of the crews that stay are really cool guys. Your average dude bros, drinking beer smoking cigs and shooting the shit. At this point the hotel is really slow, it’s after Christmas so everyone is either home or at a different work site, so they aren’t staying with us. The hotel is quiet, dark, and cold. The breathing kind of cold, the sort that comes and goes, filling you with warmth in a kind of exhale, and then inhaling the warmth right out of your body. It’s the beginning of January, so I get that it’s cold. It hasn’t been higher than 35 for the last 2 weeks, a lot of people wanting to come and stay just to avoid the cold. So, my eyes are on the cameras like glue to make sure no one is up to anything nefarious. 

Week 1. We only have 7 check ins today so a pretty boring 8 hours. All of them are prepaid and the paperwork is all done. So, easy. I fill up my water bottle, and I sit down with my Jersey Mikes sub. Can’t resist the Danny DeVito sponsorship. As I’m eating, I look up at the camera screen, here comes a lady with a small Shih Tzu. We don’t allow pets at the hotel, so I get up to go talk to her, leaving my sandwich behind. As she enters, I stop her. 

 

“Ma’am I’m sorry but we don’t allow pets in the hotel, do you have a reservation?”

“I do, I’m a diamond member, I think we can let it slide.”

“No ma’am I don’t think we can let it slide, what’s the name on the reservation?”

“Margaret Thompson. I think my husband made the reservation.”  
  


Her husband had made the reservation, and he was coming in right behind her. I look up and I tell her I’m sorry, we don’t allow pets, you’ll have to find a new hotel. I won’t bore you with the lengthy dialogue, suffice to say she’s a Karen bitch, and she’s not staying at this hotel. After about 20 minutes of fighting her, I make my way back to my sandwich. I get two bites in and here we go again, the phone rings. I hop up and run to the phone and answer, it’s another worker needed a block of rooms. We’re pretty empty so I get it done no problem. I’m on the phone with him long enough that I need to make my way over to check the pool. Inhale. A sharp and bitter cold rushes up my spine and stabs into my body. I don’t know if it’s just the shock of the temperature change or because of something real but I feel like I’m being watched. I grab the hotel master key and run to the pool. Between the hot tub and the pool, the room is humid and warm, constantly sits at around 75. One of the few rooms where sound exists, if not only because of the echo. You can hear everything in there, as I walk around and check the chairs for towels, I can hear my heartbeat. Fast and anxious, trying to warm myself from the cold shock. I finish up and brace myself before walking into the hall. I sing a loud high note, I like to hear it bounce off the walls and the water.

I walk down the hall a bit to the fitness center. A simple room with basic equipment, a small trash can that the guests can throw their towels in. I walk in, check the can, walk out. As I walk out and enter in hall, I hear the familiar beat of heart. I stop, I’m not in the pool where did that come from? I chalk it up to just a trick of the mind and go back to the desk, I have a sandwich to finish. 

The rest of the check in’s go off without a hitch. Everyone gets in and there are no issues. I change the channel from The 700 Club to AMC, they’re playing The Green Mile. It plays at least once a day, but I don’t mind that movie can make me cry every single time. “Please boss, don’t put that thing over my face, don’t put me in the dark. I’s afraid of the dark.” Niagara Falls every time. I sit in the chair and scroll on my phone until the end of my shift. I take little notes, as there wasn’t much that happened. I walk out of the office, and I make my way to the door, and I stop. Exhale, my goosebumps fade, my hair lays flat, and my heart slows. 

I arrive the next day, 15 check ins today. Mostly people still here from Christmas vacation. A pretty nice day, I stay good and busy. Between the phone calls and the check ins I have very little time to sit down until around 10:30. I finally have the chance to really get a good look at the cameras. My eyes must be playing tricks on me. Who is that on the third floor. There’s a man standing there at the far end of the hall almost sitting on the AC unit by the window. I run to check our in-house guests to see who is up on the third floor. There’s about five people up there, two families and three single people. Ok maybe it’s just someone who needed some space from family or just wanted out of their room for a bit. I sit and stare for at least 20 minutes. An unmoving man, just standing there, no expression, not playing on his phone, or anything just glaring straight back at the camera. The desk bell dings ripping me back out of the world of the unmoving man. I look up at the clock, 10:31.

The next day I come in, nothing too crazy only a few check ins so a chill and quiet night. I play on my phone for the most part and chat with some of the workers who stay here. As the day winds on it hits about 7:00 time to change the coffee. I grab the pots and march over to the kitchen. As I pour out the pots, I hear a faint singing from the second floor. I walk up to the second floor and check both ends of the hall. Nothing, but I still hear the singing, it’s above me again. I debate if I should let it slide or chase it. While it’s not too late many of the workers work night shift so they sleep until 11.  I head up in the elevator to tell them to knock it off and go to bed, and when I get there, everything is silent. It’s cold and humid, there’s a kind fog rolling across the floor. That can’t be right. The whole floor is dead silent. Not a sound from the AC units or from any of the 5 people staying on the floor. I step off the elevator and the chill shoots up my spine. Inhale. I can feel the air pulling against my shins. As the air finally slows to a stop a feel a mist roll over my eyes. I still don’t remember everything that happened on the third floor that day, and even writing about it now my head hurts trying to remember it. All I know is the mist came and then suddenly I was back in the kitchen pouring the coffee pots out again. 

The singing was gone, all that was left was the wind outside and the soft hum of the florescent lights. I finish the coffee and come back to the front desk. I go down my list to check everything off. Out of the corner of my eye I see some movement on the camera. He’s back. But only for a moment and he walks off into the stairwell. I quickly switch the camera to see where he went. I glimpse him running down the stairs as fast as he can, past the second floor. I run out to catch him on the first floor. I run down to the entrance and nothing, nothing outside either. I turn around and I see him, on the complete other side of the hotel than where he was. His face on the other side of the door, not glaring anymore, smiling. Beaming even. I stand there holding his gaze for as long as I can reasonably explain to my boss. When I move to get back to the front desk his face darts away from the door. For the rest of my shift, I can’t bring myself to look at the cameras. I can’t convince myself to look, no matter how many things I see move or shift, how many shadows I see dart across. 

Thankfully the weekend passes and nothing else happens. The cameras are clear, not a single shape, shadow, person, no singing. I make it to Monday. I sit down in my boss’s office I must ask her about this. 

“Hey Tracy, got a question for you!”

“Ok, shoot.”

“So, I’ve been seeing some weird stuff on the cameras. Do you know if the hotel is haunted or am I just crazy?”

“You’re crazy”

“Really?”

“I’ve been working here in this hotel for 20 years and not once in that time have I ever heard anyone, myself included talk about ghosts in this hotel. You’re crazy.”

“That’s not possible there’s no way that no one has ever said anything about ghosts this is a hotel! At the very least they’d make some connection to The Shining”

“I’m telling you right now, there’s no ghosts here. If you’re seeing something in the cameras maybe go to a therapist.”

“You’re probably right, I mean if no one else has ever mentioned it.”

I just shrugged defeated and looked at her. She looked back her eyes darting from me to the camera screen. Until she finally sighs and gets up to leave. She’d only been here an hour. After that she never spent much time around me at work. If I worked a morning shift, she would come in until the very end, and If I worked afternoon, she’d leave 20 minutes before I’d get there. I asked my coworker about it one day. They wouldn’t answer, just said that Tracy didn’t talk to them much anymore. ",1,1738532855.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False
1ig8o1o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ig8o1o,Czech Gauss riffle and other project Prague Spring related stuff,"An update on the unofficial project Fallout: Prague Spring. An Fallout 1 & 2 inspired YouTube project that’s to come some day lol.

Hello everyone, it’s been a while since I posted anything related to my project Fallout: Prague Spring! 
But recently I made some 3D renders that I want to share with you, and I am adding some final touches to a teaser trailer for the project and hopefully will share by the end of this week.

The first picture is of a Czech Gauss rifle variant I made today, since the Gauss rifle is a German weapon it also made sense this would be a rifle used in Czechia.

The Czech Gauss rifle Kafemlejnek (coffee grinder as I call it) is not what would be considered a late game item instead it’s a glorified automatic laser rifle.

Since it’s canon to my fan version of Fallout that Czechia had metal scarcity before the war I like to think that the weapon is made from metal donated by Czech citizens. More specifically workshop vices as I got inspired by it while designing the weapon.

The weapon itself is quite obviously inspired by the fallout 2’s version of the Gauss rifle.
There are bits of the weapon I find a bit quirky and might change them later :p


Second picture is a rendered 3D space of how I imagine the final version of the project would look like.
(Currently all the 3D models I design are made using blender).

Prague is a nation still at war with a Bolshevik threat and her streets are still militarized. The whole city decorated in national colors and dressed in national flags. As instead of Halloween, Czechoslovakia was soon to celebrate it’s Independence Day.
Only for the celebration to never come.

This picture mostly serves as a way to set the very somber and melancholic feeling the project is to give, the idea of something that is dead but continues to live on in the past never moving forward.

Last picture is the logo for the project, depicting a Czechoslovak boarder pillar set a blaze. 

I hope you like these little teasers, and if you have any suggestions I’d be happy to hear them out!

1ig8n98,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1ig8n98/my_wifes_cold_was_something_much_worse/,My wife's cold was something much worse,"For twenty-five years, I was in a rigid routine. I’d work in the mornings, come home to my wife later in the afternoons, and we’d spend our evenings together eating her home cooked meals and watching TV until night came and we would go to bed. Then we would do it all over again. Sometimes I would doubt our life together. A nagging voice in the back of my head told me I didn’t do enough for her. That we should want for more. But then I’d wake up, and hear her singing softly as she cooked our breakfast, and any doubts I had would fade away. We could have kept going like that forever, but we never got the chance.

I’m sat here alone now in our bedroom, huddled up in a blanket, typing on my laptop, and eating some awful fast food. I can’t bear to leave this room. I know that if I open that door and walk down that hall, I’ll pass what used to be our kitchen. What remains is just an open, lifeless room. The cabinets had to be torn out and the floor ripped up from the damage. I arranged for some good men from the church to take the stove one day. I couldn’t bear to be there when they took it. I left the front door unlocked and hid like a coward, until I heard them leave.

I already burned through my bereavement leave, but I haven’t gone back to work. I just sit in our room and listen. I keep hoping to hear her voice again. Instead, all I hear is silence. The house is so quiet. So still. And in those endless spans of silence my mind fills in the void with harsh memories. The thoughts eat away at me like acid. Sometimes its questions, about what I could have done differently. Other times its like a film on repeat, the scenes playing out relentlessly. On the worst days, in the cold silence, the thing that consumes my mind are those final moments I had with her.

A week before it happened, she told me what was wrong. It was a warm Monday afternoon and I had just gotten home from work. She was in her usual place, cooking over the stove. The sound of sizzling pan-seared steak filled my ears. The room was slightly smoky and it smelt heavenly throughout the house. I could feel the heat as I walked into the kitchen to greet her.

She was wearing some jeans and that tan cardigan she liked over her blouse. I hugged her, head over her shoulder, and asked how she was doing today, like I did every day. I expected her to say something sweet in her usual way. Instead, she surprised me when she said,

“I’m cold”.

I laughed at her. I thought it was a joke. I mean, it was a nice 84 degrees outside, and it was noticeably hotter in the kitchen. I genuinely thought she was just pulling my leg but no. She didn’t laugh back. Didn’t even smile. She rolled up her sleeve and showed me her goosebumps with a look of tentative concern.

We figured she had a weird fever. She didn’t feel particularly warm, but we decided to treat it like a fever anyways and I put her to bed after dinner, skipping our TV shows that night. She got under the covers, despite me telling her not to, but I let it slide. As I was leaving the room to let her rest, I remember how she grabbed my hand and she asked me if I would stay for a prayer. Church had always been more of her thing than mine, but I didn’t mind. I thought she might feel better if she did, so I closed my eyes and let her pray:

“Dear Heavenly Father, Hallowed be thy name. You are the Father of health and wellness and Satan is the father of sickness and suffering. I pray that this sickness will leave my body and I will feel your warmth once again. In your name I pray, amen.”

She seemed satisfied and I wanted to give her space so I left and tended to the house. I washed the dishes, cleaned up the kitchen, and watched some of our shows without her. I remember feeling lonely that night. Her absence felt like a tear in a winter coat. When I came to bed, I was relieved to have her by my side again. I was sure that in a day or two this fever would pass and she’d be right by my side again. But this wasn’t a fever.

Our routine was disrupted into something new. Something worse. Now, I’d come home, and go straight to our bedroom to see her. She insisted on turning off the fans and keeping the door shut. When I opened the door, my glasses fogged. I’d find her, kept under more blankets than I remembered giving her, usually sleeping. I’d sit by her, and ask her how she was feeling. Each day she gave the same one-word answer, each more disheartened than the last.  

“Cold.”

The task of cooking fell on me, and I thought I couldn’t go wrong with some chicken noodle soup. It was supposed to help, but I’m no cook. There was always missing something. Something I couldn’t give it. But we ate it all the same. I learned I had to let it cool before I gave it to her, otherwise she’d scald her mouth, not that she seemed to mind.

After dinner, I would clean up, watch some shows alone while she went back to sleep, then I’d join her in bed. I’d try to snuggle up to her. To give her some of my body heat. I tried to take the cold from her. But after a time, I gave up. She was too cold to hold on to for any long period of time. I wish I held her anyways.

Sometimes, I would press my hand against her cheek. Then her forehead. Sometimes, she pressed back against my hand. This sickness had affected her physically, but under those blankets, behind the shivering, somewhere beyond the cold, the woman I loved was in there, fighting.

The earliest doctor’s appointment we could get was Thursday morning. I took some time off work in order to make the appointment. That morning was a relaxing 75 degrees, but looking at her, you wouldn’t know it. She wore a heavy coat and sweat pants with long johns underneath. A scarf and beanie hid her face from the world. Hidden behind the layers, her eyes looked tired. 

She got looks from the staff and patients alike in the clinic. I checked her in and she did her best not to chatter her teeth as I filled out the forms. In short, the clinic was a bust. They took her back there, and did a standard checkup. Nothing was out of the ordinary according to them. They chalked it up to poor circulation, wrote a prescription, and they sent us away without any other consideration. I made sure she took the medicine, but it didn’t help her.  

I took a full day off work that Friday, and did what I could. I came back from the store that morning and began to haul in what should’ve helped. I set up a space heater, draped a thick winter blanket over her, and assured her that I had been looking up recipes for some better soups. Despite all this, I heard her shivering as I closed the door.

She laid in there all day, only getting up to use the restroom, but that was getting less frequent. I would sit in there for ten minutes or so at a time, before having to leave again. The room was too hot now, and I couldn’t stand to be in there for any longer than I was. I checked on her often. Sat when I could. And when I was out, I would call the doctor again and explain that she was getting worse. She was getting colder. There was nothing they could or would do. Friday night came and went. More soup. More tea. More dishes. I had to take to sleeping on the couch, as our room was far too hot for me. Every couple hours I woke up alone, and when I did, I would walk over to the door, and listen for her. Once I heard her shivering. Another time she was snoring. Another, she was crying.

Saturday morning, I woke up later than normal. I began the new routine. Start the coffee, start the tea, start breakfast. It was quiet that morning. Lifeless. I could never cook like her. She had an aura about her that filled the house with energy when she cooked. Most mornings she’d be cooking, humming along to some song I never knew, without a care in the world. She was happy. Maybe that’s what my dishes were missing. Everything I cooked was made with worry.

I put it all on a tray and took it to our room. After a night without her I was determined to bear the heat and sit with her for longer. When I opened the door, I found our bed empty, seven blankets strewn about the room, thrown off without care, leading to our bathroom.

The shower was running. Steam billowed out of the bathroom and bled into our bedroom from behind the closed door. I put down the tray and knocked. Then again. Then with more urgency. Each time I got no answer. I had begun to sweat. The heat from the room was bad enough, but the steam from the bathroom felt scalding. I tried the door, but it was locked. I had to think but the heat was starting to take its toll on me. I felt sapped. Exhausted. How could she stand this horrible room? I yelled for her. And when I heard no answer, I used what strength I could muster, and kicked the door. Once. Then twice. Then the door gave way. The heat hit me like an oven, and inside, was my wife.

I found her in the shower, burned and shivering. She was sat on the shower floor with the water hitting her back. There was a big red circle where the water had burned her. Soft chunks of skin flowed off her back and toward the drain. I learned that she had turned the temperature on our water heater as high as it would go, and then turned the shower on and sat. She didn’t know how long she was in there. Or how long she would have stayed if I didn’t get her. All that she knew is that she was cold.

I got her out of the shower. She fought me till I mentioned the blankets, then she let me guide her back to bed. I dressed her wound the best I could with what we had and turned the water heater back down, cooler than before.

She got really low after that. She refused to go to the clinic again. Or anywhere for that matter. The heater and blankets were at home, and that’s where she demanded to stay.

That night, I sat with her. Sweat stained my clothes, but I paid it no mind. My wife needed me. I was at a loss, and I felt desperately powerless to help her. I prayed with her. I thought it’s what she needed, and it’s all I had left to try. I prayed like she had. I asked God for forgiveness and healing and warmth. I prayed with conviction. I nearly believed it. Maybe I just needed to believe in something. I knew that she believed in it, and if nothing else, I hoped that she would feel comfort in the prayer. When I stopped praying, she began her own prayer.

What she prayed, I can’t repeat. What I can say is that the cold had reached her heart and corrupted her faith. She said things I never thought I’d hear from a good Christian woman like her. She denied God, and His forgiveness. She promised her soul to the devil, as long as Satan promised that the fires of Hell were warm. Any enthusiasm, any hope she had was gone. The cold had taken it away.

I slept on the couch that night.

That Sunday morning, I woke up groggy. The couch had not been treating me well, and the anxiety had treated me worse. I got up anyways, and headed to the kitchen. It was time for the routine to start again. She needed me. More coffee, more tea, more breakfast that doesn't quite taste right. 

When I got to the kitchen, I heard that familiar humming. That comforting sound of cabinets and drawers opening and shutting. She was back, and she was cooking up something heavenly. It smelt like a ham steak, and I remember thinking that was a strange choice for breakfast, but I was just happy that she was feeling like herself again. She was wearing shorts and a tank top. She was reaching on her tip toes for something deep in the cabinet, when I walked in to greet her.

“What’s for breakfast, dear?”

She didn’t acknowledge me. She just kept looking in the cabinet above the stove. I looked at the stove top, and saw that the burner was on. As she was reaching further back into that cabinet, she had placed her hand on the burning cast iron pan, and it was sizzling.

The adrenaline hit my blood like cement. She found what she was looking for. Before I could comprehend what was happening, she had doused herself in cooking oil. She turned to face me. In her mangled hand she held a matchbox. In her good hand she held a match.

In an instant she and the kitchen were engulfed in flames. She didn't scream. She didn't flail around. She sat on the ground, arms hugging her knees to her chest. Among the crackling of the fire, I heard her teeth chatter. She shivered while she burned.

My wife is gone. My life is gone. I have nothing but the memories and this feeling I can’t shake.

1ig8kgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ig8kgn/i_work_in_a_hotel_and_theres_something_odd_on_the/,"I work in a hotel, and there's something odd on the cameras.","Part 1. 

My name is Andrew, I’ve only worked here a few months, and one of the first things they taught me was to always keep my eyes on the cameras. You never know when something is going to pop up that you need to take notes on. Most of the time there’s nothing interesting, just people running to the pool, or getting ice, running to the gas station next door, or just leaving to go to the Applebees. Dollarita’s were back when I started so that’s where most people were. The first month flew by, simple easy, we don’t have a very large hotel, only 4 floors, and like 60 rooms. When I started, we had a lot of stay overs, and a couple of university teams. Essentially, only ever about 30 people in the hotel at a time. We also have a lot construction crews that stay with us while they work on site. 

Most of the crews that stay are really cool guys. Your average dude bros, drinking beer smoking cigs and shooting the shit. At this point the hotel is really slow, it’s after Christmas so everyone is either home or at a different work site, so they aren’t staying with us. The hotel is quiet, dark, and cold. The breathing kind of cold, the sort that comes and goes, filling you with warmth in a kind of exhale, and then inhaling the warmth right out of your body. It’s the beginning of January, so I get that it’s cold. It hasn’t been higher than 35 for the last 2 weeks, a lot of people wanting to come and stay just to avoid the cold. So, my eyes are on the cameras like glue to make sure no one is up to anything nefarious. 

Week 1. We only have 7 check ins today so a pretty boring 8 hours. All of them are prepaid and the paperwork is all done. So, easy. I fill up my water bottle, and I sit down with my Jersey Mikes sub. Can’t resist the Danny DeVito sponsorship. As I’m eating, I look up at the camera screen, here comes a lady with a small Shih Tzu. We don’t allow pets at the hotel, so I get up to go talk to her, leaving my sandwich behind. As she enters, I stop her. 

 

“Ma’am I’m sorry but we don’t allow pets in the hotel, do you have a reservation?”

“I do, I’m a diamond member, I think we can let it slide.”

“No ma’am I don’t think we can let it slide, what’s the name on the reservation?”

“Margaret Thompson. I think my husband made the reservation.”

Her husband had made the reservation, and he was coming in right behind her. I look up and I tell her I’m sorry, we don’t allow pets, you’ll have to find a new hotel. I won’t bore you with the lengthy dialogue, suffice to say she’s a Karen bitch, and she’s not staying at this hotel. After about 20 minutes of fighting her, I make my way back to my sandwich. I get two bites in and here we go again, the phone rings. I hop up and run to the phone and answer, it’s another worker needed a block of rooms. We’re pretty empty so I get it done no problem. I’m on the phone with him long enough that I need to make my way over to check the pool. Inhale. A sharp and bitter cold rushes up my spine and stabs into my body. I don’t know if it’s just the shock of the temperature change or because of something real but I feel like I’m being watched. I grab the hotel master key and run to the pool. Between the hot tub and the pool, the room is humid and warm, constantly sits at around 75. One of the few rooms where sound exists, if not only because of the echo. You can hear everything in there, as I walk around and check the chairs for towels, I can hear my heartbeat. Fast and anxious, trying to warm myself from the cold shock. I finish up and brace myself before walking into the hall. I sing a loud high note, I like to hear it bounce off the walls and the water.

I walk down the hall a bit to the fitness center. A simple room with basic equipment, a small trash can that the guests can throw their towels in. I walk in, check the can, walk out. As I walk out and enter in hall, I hear the familiar beat of heart. I stop, I’m not in the pool where did that come from? I chalk it up to just a trick of the mind and go back to the desk, I have a sandwich to finish. 

The rest of the check in’s go off without a hitch. Everyone gets in and there are no issues. I change the channel from The 700 Club to AMC, they’re playing The Green Mile. It plays at least once a day, but I don’t mind that movie can make me cry every single time. “Please boss, don’t put that thing over my face, don’t put me in the dark. I’s afraid of the dark.” Niagara Falls every time. I sit in the chair and scroll on my phone until the end of my shift. I take little notes, as there wasn’t much that happened. I walk out of the office, and I make my way to the door, and I stop. Exhale, my goosebumps fade, my hair lays flat, and my heart slows. 

I arrive the next day, 15 check ins today. Mostly people still here from Christmas vacation. A pretty nice day, I stay good and busy. Between the phone calls and the check ins I have very little time to sit down until around 10:30. I finally have the chance to really get a good look at the cameras. My eyes must be playing tricks on me. Who is that on the third floor. There’s a man standing there at the far end of the hall almost sitting on the AC unit by the window. I run to check our in-house guests to see who is up on the third floor. There’s about five people up there, two families and three single people. Ok maybe it’s just someone who needed some space from family or just wanted out of their room for a bit. I sit and stare for at least 20 minutes. An unmoving man, just standing there, no expression, not playing on his phone, or anything just glaring straight back at the camera. The desk bell dings ripping me back out of the world of the unmoving man. I look up at the clock, 10:31.

The next day I come in, nothing too crazy only a few check ins so a chill and quiet night. I play on my phone for the most part and chat with some of the workers who stay here. As the day winds on it hits about 7:00 time to change the coffee. I grab the pots and march over to the kitchen. As I pour out the pots, I hear a faint singing from the second floor. I walk up to the second floor and check both ends of the hall. Nothing, but I still hear the singing, it’s above me again. I debate if I should let it slide or chase it. While it’s not too late many of the workers work night shift so they sleep until 11.  I head up in the elevator to tell them to knock it off and go to bed, and when I get there, everything is silent. It’s cold and humid, there’s a kind fog rolling across the floor. That can’t be right. The whole floor is dead silent. Not a sound from the AC units or from any of the 5 people staying on the floor. I step off the elevator and the chill shoots up my spine. Inhale. I can feel the air pulling against my shins. As the air finally slows to a stop a feel a mist roll over my eyes. I still don’t remember everything that happened on the third floor that day, and even writing about it now my head hurts trying to remember it. All I know is the mist came and then suddenly I was back in the kitchen pouring the coffee pots out again. 

The singing was gone, all that was left was the wind outside and the soft hum of the florescent lights. I finish the coffee and come back to the front desk. I go down my list to check everything off. Out of the corner of my eye I see some movement on the camera. He’s back. But only for a moment and he walks off into the stairwell. I quickly switch the camera to see where he went. I glimpse him running down the stairs as fast as he can, past the second floor. I run out to catch him on the first floor. I run down to the entrance and nothing, nothing outside either. I turn around and I see him, on the complete other side of the hotel than where he was. His face on the other side of the door, not glaring anymore, smiling. Beaming even. I stand there holding his gaze for as long as I can reasonably explain to my boss. When I move to get back to the front desk his face darts away from the door. For the rest of my shift, I can’t bring myself to look at the cameras. I can’t convince myself to look, no matter how many things I see move or shift, how many shadows I see dart across. 

Thankfully the weekend passes and nothing else happens. The cameras are clear, not a single shape, shadow, person, no singing. I make it to Monday. I sit down in my boss’s office I must ask her about this. 

“Hey Tracy, got a question for you!”

“Ok, shoot.”

“So, I’ve been seeing some weird stuff on the cameras. Do you know if the hotel is haunted or am I just crazy?”

“You’re crazy”

“Really?”

“I’ve been working here in this hotel for 20 years and not once in that time have I ever heard anyone, myself included talk about ghosts in this hotel. You’re crazy.”

“That’s not possible there’s no way that no one has ever said anything about ghosts this is a hotel! At the very least they’d make some connection to The Shining”

“I’m telling you right now, there’s no ghosts here. If you’re seeing something in the cameras maybe go to a therapist.”

“You’re probably right, I mean if no one else has ever mentioned it.”

I just shrugged defeated and looked at her. She looked back her eyes darting from me to the camera screen. Until she finally sighs and gets up to leave. She’d only been here an hour. After that she never spent much time around me at work. If I worked a morning shift, she would come in until the very end, and If I worked afternoon, she’d leave 20 minutes before I’d get there. I asked my coworker about it one day. They wouldn’t answer, just said that Tracy didn’t talk to them much anymore. ",1,1738532562.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

People always have questions about how to date when you have alopecia or wear wigs. Here is my two cents. I'm no expert but I did manage to have a few boyfriends and eventually got married.  

Tinder. Lol.  

Ok.  Here's my advice and what I did. 


1. Put your best foot forward but be honest.  

I put alopecia in my profile but it was like the 3rd picture.  I made sure to include flattering pics with just one with my bald head and wrote it in my bio. It kind of ended up being a conversation starter.  Sometimes dudes would message me and say ""me too!!!"" There will dudes that care but then there are guys that won't. 

2. Exercise and eat well.  Take care of your health. 

But,  I'm not gonna lie. I went to gym 4/5 times a week and tried to look as good as I could. Staying fit will help your confidence and men are still attracted to your feminine form.  I have good curves and can turn some heads with bodycon dress.  So,  take care of your health, mostly. I think the older you get , beauty is tied to health. If you take care of your body,  by the time your 40, you will prob look better than a lot of your peers because so many people DO NOT take of themselves.  

3. Go out on as many dates as you can

Sometimes we shoot ourselves in the foot when we won't even give some people the chance. I went out with a lot of guys, just coffee or bookstore or whatever.  I went on so many.  Some of them were awful,  some ok and some were great. And also,  sometimes I would go out with someone I wasn't particularly attracted to at first but found myself more attracted later if we got along well.  

4. Don't accept situationships.  

Human nature is dumb and people never appreciate what it freely given.  They appreciate what it earned. If someone has not earned or shown that they care for you,  don't give it away. 

5. Have interesting hobbies

This is the best way to meet people is to meet and connect with them through a shared hobby. I like hiking,  camping and boat riding.  Attraction isn't just physical.  It's also about being interesting/ fun to be with.  

6. Avoid negative self talk in front of others

Insecurity is not attractive.  People don't like it when others are down on themselves.  It kills the energy in the room.  I also think people mirror our attitudes and pick up when we are uncomfortable. Just think,  it's depressing to hear someone talk bad about themselves.  It makes that person a drag to be around. Never forget you're not the only one with insecurities. When you show confidence in yourself,  you give others the subconscious permission to do the same.

People starting out in life have always (en masse) been poor, have always scratched to manage life’s curveballs, and have always felt like they were just in an endless loop of barely staying above water. The difference was, we didn’t try to have more *now*, we just kept plugging away and gradually, over a decade or two, it got better. That’s how establishing yourself in life from nothing works. It starts with almost drowning, then over a few years you inch your way to having just enough to being a month in front on your bills so most of the curve balls stop, then over another seven years or so you get to having a proactively maintained car and preventative health care, and after a decade of this almost all the curve balls stop. Then you’re far enough ahead to finally save a little. Then it becomes exponential and after a few more years life quite abruptly stops being terribly hard. But it is work done in minuscule increments, literally a dollar or two at a time, and you have to make the sacrifices for it. For me, a cafe coffee was literally a once a month budgeted luxury. For my kids, who make much more than me then even adjusting for inflation and rental affordability, they get food delivered half a dozen times a week.

He was the one to bring up a talk about what we’re looking for and said that he wanted a committed relationship and he thought I’m ’the one’ even though I didn’t ask. He was always asking me deep questions, making it clear that he was super into me, said that he deleted the app and not talking to anyone else and never mentioned any sexual stuff, only cute things and compliments. That went on for 5 days, we were supposed to have a date on Sunday, but on Saturday he said he couldn’t wait anymore and asked to meet me for a coffee in my area, just for 30 minutes to at least be able to hug me. 

We meet, sparks are flying everywhere, he’s all over me - hugging, touching, kissing my hands, cheeks, forehead, saying over and over how beautiful I am, how perfect I am, how happy he is. We discuss how our next date will go, what we’re going to do next week, family and friends, what are my favorite flowers, all seems to be going perfect, I feel like I’m finally about to be in a committed relationship with a good man! 

He walks me home, we’re all over each other, kissing, not being able to let go. I come home, he texts me that he already misses me.

Sunday morning he texts me as usual, being cute, saying that he still has my smell on him and stuff. He was supposed to pick me up after my dance class and I ask what time he’s going to come get me. He then disappears for 2 hours and then answers that he’s sorry and his coworker failed him and will not be able to cover for him. I read the messages and do not answer. He asks me what I am doing and then when I don’t reply he asks if I’m mad. I say that yes I’m upset. He disappears for 6 FREAKING HOURS, I get worried and ask if anything’s happened. 

He answers some time later that he’s had a super bad day at work and doesn’t respond to my messages anymore. I’m crying whole Monday and decide to text him on Tuesday and ask if he’s okay because he disappeared so abruptly and I’m worried. He replies, saying that he’s having problems at work and all this time his phone was on dnd and he didn’t talk to anybody. I try my best to support him and say nice things- to which he replies  politely but cold ‘thanks for your attention and support’. That’s it. He didn’t ask how I’m doing, nothing, and I haven’t heard from him since. I’ve been crying the whole week trying to figure out what went wrong. 

What did I do? If he didn’t like me, he wouldn’t say all this cute stuff during and after date, wouldn’t always try to touch me , wouldn’t make plans, right? I just don’t understand. I feel so lost because I fell in love with him. He still follows me on instagram, watches my stories, haven’t deleted the chat. If he really is having this rough period at work, he could’ve communicated that with me if he liked me, right?
Please help me, I am losing my mind over this…

I'm making this post for the other sufferers here. After reading a few posts on here I could see the agony that others are going through and remembered what it was like in the beginning. I got the syndrome 12 years ago and am fine now. So I kind of have a duty to give you all a heads up and avert the worst outcomes.

Firstly, don't end you life over it. Really, don't. The syndrome is absolutely curable, it often just goes away with time. DHT levels rise over time, that's why you go bald, and you can also target the syndrome to speed things up. I got it 12 years ago and it's basically gone. Symptoms have been negligible for years. I am now absolutely, totally fine, even though I really wasn't fine initially. I now have lots of friends, a job, a girlfriend, plenty of sex, play sports, can focus, and I live and love and all the rest of it. My life outcomes are way better than some non-PFS friends. Importantly, I have returned to emotional normality too. 

Secondly, what to do about it. Being wary of the forum rules around theorising I will simply state what happened to me rather than be too prescriptive. 

I am 33. I got the syndrome when I was 21, on 13 June 2012. I woke up with the 'crash'. Symptoms included ED, massive debilitating brain fog, emotional/personality changes, feeling like I was shut out of the world/dead or gone inside, dry mouth/face etc, etc, all the rest of it.

I had gut issues right from the start. The previous evening I'd eaten an unhealthy meal. I had also taken fin intermittently prior to the crash which may have contributed.

I tried at first to manipulate my hormones: taking supplements that targeted testosterone and DHT. This massively backfired. Made me way worse and put me in a terrible place for years.

After several years I realised the things that worked tended to be gut-related. Fasting, changing foods, green tea/coffee, armodafinil/modafinil (they make you poop right away...), branched chain amino acids, even saurkraut helped under some conditions, all had links to the gut. Improvements in symptoms went together with gut improvements and vice versa.

Things I found massively helped:

- branched chain amino acids. Discovered this in 2021, so perhaps there is some recency bias. But it is a significant help. Takes at least two days to kick in. It would return my mind to sharp focus again and settle my gut. I would be curious to know if anyone else gets this. I sometimes still take it and it has a small benefit. I take a 2-4 grams the first two to three days then micro dose the days after and the benefits are retained so long as I take it.

- fasting. I did a five day water fast about 4 years in and it moved the dial. I did maybe 3 over the course of 6 years. First one had biggest benefit.

-armodafinil/modafinil. Took it initially just to treat brain fog. But it boosts your libido over time. I think it did something kind of long term on my gut flora which was helpful.

-proton pump inhibitors. I took it by accident, when I was prescribed 30g lanzoprazole daily. Low doses did nothing but high doses (sometimes 90g or so) completely altered my mood after a few days. Raised my energy too. Made me feel so much better. Some benefits of PPIs stayed long term after stopping them.

Things that also helped:

-Creatine. Especially in the beginning, helped me feel temporarily normal. Reduced my brain fog a bit and helped me build muscle by doing heavy weights, which dampened the initial symptoms.

-Green tea. Helped me focus. Coffee too.

Things that may have helped but I can't be sure:

-Fecal microbiota transplant. It's expensive. I tried this, at a centre in the UK and it definitely helped a bit. I felt more emotionally stable afterwards, and obviously you can feel your gut reacting. However, it wasn't the night/day change in symptoms you might expect. After the FMT I still had gas and gut issues that ran together with psychological symptoms and fatigue, and these were resolved by taking BCAAs again. So FMT might not be the silver bullet for gut issues that people expect. If I had a limited budget I'd try other approaches to target the gut and keep this to last.

Currently, I am taking a herbal mix to test a theory about why branched chain amino acids help me. Namely, that they are altering gut flora. In my case, everything that helped long term seemed to be linked to the gut.

Other people may be different and I am not suggesting people do exactly what I have done. Even if your gut flora is disrupted, it might not be disrupted in exactly the same way as mine. So BCAAs might do nothing, or you may find something totally different works very well. I met someone who swore Rhodiola worked, whereas I didn't notice much from it. Your PFS might also have different symptoms (Peyronie's or something) that would require a kind of relief that I am not familiar with. 

My story, as it's 12 years long, is obviously far more complex and convoluted than what I've said. There were many ups and downs. But the key thing is: the depression/awful feeling you have is not because the world is awful, but because the syndrome makes you artificially feel that way. The world is actually fine, and you'll eventually be fine too once the syndrome lifts as a result of time passing or landing on a lucky supplement or regimen that suddenly works. Just keep chipping away at it and testing things (safely though... keep someone else in the loop to double check what you're doing) and above all wait it out and you will get better. You'll make breakthroughs and one day in future you'll nearly forget this ever happened to you.",2,1738532298.0,FinasterideSyndrome,2,0.75,False

I'm an American planning for my solo trip in Australia in early March. I'm spending just a couple of days in Sydney (flying in on a Monday night, flying out on late Friday afternoon) and decided going to the Blue Mountains would be a great way to spend one of those days.

I just want to make sure I have this right. I don't plan to get a car, so I'll take the train to Katoomba and arrive around 9AM. I don't really see the point of paying for hop on/ hop off. I live in NYC so I don't particularly mind walking 15-20km on the day if it comes to that!

So I imagine I'd head to town in Katoomba, grab some coffee, and go to Scenic World. Then walk over to Echo Point and do the Three Sisters stroll (I'm planning on Weds so it shouldn't be too crowded?). Then walk through the Leura Cascades. Then I'd grab a late lunch (I saw recommendations for high tea?) and then head out to Gordon Falls. Then I'd make my way back to Leura Station and be back in Sydney in time for a late dinner.

Is that a plausible itinerary? Should I just pay for the hop on/ hop off just to save on time? In my ideal world I'm back at Central at 5:30-6, so I could go to my hotel, take a shower, and go out for dinner by 7.",1,1738532171.0,AustraliaTravel,1,1.0,False

He was the one to bring up a talk about what we’re looking for and said that he wanted a committed relationship and he thought I’m ’the one’ even though I didn’t ask. He was always asking me deep questions, making it clear that he was super into me, said that he deleted the app and not talking to anyone else and never mentioned any sexual stuff, only cute things and compliments. That went on for 5 days, we were supposed to have a date on Sunday, but on Saturday he said he couldn’t wait anymore and asked to meet me for a coffee in my area, just for 30 minutes to at least be able to hug me. 

We meet, sparks are flying everywhere, he’s all over me - hugging, touching, kissing my hands, cheeks, forehead, saying over and over how beautiful I am, how perfect I am, how happy he is. We discuss how our next date will go, what we’re going to do next week, family and friends, what are my favorite flowers, all seems to be going perfect, I feel like I’m finally about to be in a committed relationship with a good man! 

He walks me home, we’re all over each other, kissing, not being able to let go. I come home, he texts me that he already misses me.

Sunday morning he texts me as usual, being cute, saying that he still has my smell on him and stuff. He was supposed to pick me up after my dance class and I ask what time he’s going to come get me. He then disappears for 2 hours and then answers that he’s sorry and his coworker failed him and will not be able to cover for him. I read the messages and do not answer. He asks me what I am doing and then when I don’t reply he asks if I’m mad. I say that yes I’m upset. He disappears for 6 FREAKING HOURS, I get worried and ask if anything’s happened. 

He answers some time later that he’s had a super bad day at work and doesn’t respond to my messages anymore. I’m crying whole Monday and decide to text him on Tuesday and ask if he’s okay because he disappeared so abruptly and I’m worried. He replies, saying that he’s having problems at work and all this time his phone was on dnd and he didn’t talk to anybody. I try my best to support him and say nice things- to which he replies  politely but cold ‘thanks for your attention and support’. That’s it. He didn’t ask how I’m doing, nothing, and I haven’t heard from him since. I’ve been crying the whole week trying to figure out what went wrong. 

What did I do? If he didn’t like me, he wouldn’t say all this cute stuff during and after date, wouldn’t always try to touch me , wouldn’t make plans, right? I just don’t understand. I feel so lost because I fell in love with him. He still follows me on instagram, watches my stories, haven’t deleted the chat. If he really is having this rough period at work, he could’ve communicated that with me if he liked me, right?

Additionally, the set includes a Serving Tray attributed to August Fraumont, a renowned 19th-century French silversmith, featuring elaborate hand-chased Rococo designs.

Any insights into the potential value or historical significance of this set would be greatly appreciated. I see sets of expensive sterling selling for $10k+. Hopefully I got something good on my hands. Thank you!

Instead of being careful, he ended up hitting the back of our pregnant friend with it, it made a loud thud. She immediately turned around, and I instinctively said, “Wait a second, kuya. You saw she’s pregnant, and you still pushed through with that?”

And he had the audacity to respond, “Excuse me nga, di ba?” My head started hurting because, honestly, one of his companions had already found a way to avoid passing behind her. So I just replied, “You said “excuse me” but you still hit her with the chair. You heard the loud thud, right?”

A bit about me:


No degree


Experience
- coffee industry: 10+ years 
- 7 years in a managerial/head role working with importers and freight companies managing lifecycle of SKU inventory and demand. 


Currently, im in a weird position where half of my work is focused on demand planning and purchasing/sourcing the rest is managing a coffee roasting operation. 

I am also slowly studying and implementing CPIM concepts into my current work as well. 


I’d like to get out of coffee as there’s not much financial growth in this industry unless I go into an importing company which is an extremely rare job. Or picked up by a big name company.

To the woman who is my heart, my home, my everything,

Loving you is not just a choice I make—it is who I am. It is woven into every breath I take, every thought that lingers in my mind, every beat of my heart that only seems to make sense when it is beating for you. You are not just the love of my life—you are my life, the reason I look toward every tomorrow with purpose, with gratitude, with unwavering devotion.

I want you to know that there is no mountain too high, no storm too fierce, no darkness too heavy that I would not walk through for you. I would stand in the face of anything this world throws your way and fight for you, protect you, shield you from every pain, every doubt, every moment of fear. When the weight of the world feels too much, when the burdens try to bend you, you will never carry them alone. I will be there. I will stand beside you, my strength wrapping around you, my love anchoring you through it all.

But love is not only found in the battles we fight—it is also in the quiet moments, the ones that truly define a life shared. I will be there not just in the hard times, but in the beautiful ones, the simple ones, the moments that turn into memories we will cherish for a lifetime. I will be the one who brings you coffee (even though I can’t stand it) in the morning just the way you like it, who kisses your forehead before you even open your eyes. I will be the one who holds your hand while we walk through life together, who listens—truly listens—to every story, every dream, every thought that passes through your mind because every piece of you matters to me.

I will be your home—the place you come to for warmth, for laughter, for understanding, for safety. No matter where we are in this world, no matter what roads we take, you will always find home in my arms, in my touch, in the steady certainty that my love for you will never falter.

I will be your champion, the one who lifts you higher, who reminds you of the extraordinary woman that you are when you forget it yourself. I will celebrate your victories, big and small, and remind you every day of your strength, your beauty, your brilliance.

I will be your admirer, always looking at you the way I did from the start—with awe, with wonder, with a love that never dulls, never fades. I will remind you with my touch, with my words, with every glance, that you are breathtaking—not just in the way you look, but in the way you are.

I will be your lover, knowing you in ways no one else ever will. I will trace every curve of your body with reverence, with devotion, with a hunger that never wavers. I will worship you with my lips, with my hands, with the fire in my soul that only you can ignite.

I will be your soulmate, the one who knows you not just in this lifetime, but in ways that feel like we have known each other forever. As if our love was written long before we ever touched, as if the universe was always leading me to you.

I will be your best friend, the one who makes you laugh until your sides ache, who listens without judgment, who understands your silences just as much as your words.

I will be yours, in every way, in every moment, in every breath.

And I will not be quiet about it.

I want the world to know what a privilege it is to love you. I want the world to know that you are mine, and that I am the luckiest man alive because of it. I will never take you for granted. Not for a single second. I will wake up every day thanking God that I have been given you, and I will go to bed every night knowing that nothing—nothing—in this world could ever compare to the gift of your love.

So hear me when I say this—I will never stop showing up for you. Not just in the grand moments, but in the quiet ones. Not just when it’s easy, but when it’s hard. Not just today, not just tomorrow, but for as long as I have breath in my lungs.

I'm a man in my 30s, I've gone on four dates with a woman in her 30s over the span of a month. We matched on Hinge in July, then she didn't reply for 6 months, then she reached out Jan 1. I've had some friends cringe at this, but I can honestly say it doesn't bother me to be dating someone now who disappeared shortly after we matched

She's cool, we get along well, but haven't done anything physical and frankly I have doubts (not confirmation) as to whether she's even attracted to me. 

Like she might solicit compliments ""what do you like about me? :)"" during flirty times, but then when I ask the same question back, I get back an answer that would be completely fine during an HR review, it's such mild stuff you could say it to your coworkers (like that I am nice, or thoughtful). I didn't say anything crazy to her, but that's she's pretty and some other reasonable compliments.
At the end of one date, she didn't even hug me, just fled! That felt bad

On the other hand, last date I changed our plan for coffee/walk to brunch, but then she still wanted to go on a long, cold walk afterward and seemed disappointed when i had to go - point is, she likes spending time with me at least, and she responds quickly and warmly by text or reaches out on her own

Should I plan something for Valentine's day? If so....what? 

I haven't been in a relationship before or beyond a 6th date with someone so I don't really know what's expected here. Should I ask her? That seems to run counter to everything I know about Valentine's day, which admittedly isn't much...

If we'd been dating for 3 months, and I didn't have the doubt about her attraction, I wouldn't even have to ask, I'd plan a nice dinner + maybe a fun activity. Here, I don't know what I should be doing. Please help! Thank you!",1,1738531937.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I will be the one who holds your hand while we walk through life together, who listens—truly listens—to every story, every dream, every thought that passes through your mind because every piece of you matters to me.

I will be your home—the place you come to for warmth, for laughter, for understanding, for safety. No matter where we are in this world, no matter what roads we take, you will always find home in my arms, in my touch, in the steady certainty that my love for you will never falter.

I will be your champion, the one who lifts you higher, who reminds you of the extraordinary woman that you are when you forget it yourself. I will celebrate your victories, big and small, and remind you every day of your strength, your beauty, your brilliance.

I will be your admirer, always looking at you the way I did from the start—with awe, with wonder, with a love that never dulls, never fades. I will remind you with my touch, with my words, with every glance, that you are breathtaking—not just in the way you look, but in the way you are.

I will be your lover, knowing you in ways no one else ever will. I will trace every curve of your body with reverence, with devotion, with a hunger that never wavers. I will worship you with my lips, with my hands, with the fire in my soul that only you can ignite.

I will be your soulmate, the one who knows you not just in this lifetime, but in ways that feel like we have known each other forever. As if our love was written long before we ever touched, as if the universe was always leading me to you.

I will be your best friend, the one who makes you laugh until your sides ache, who listens without judgment, who understands your silences just as much as your words.

I will be yours, in every way, in every moment, in every breath.

And I will not be quiet about it.

I want the world to know what a privilege it is to love you. I want the world to know that you are mine, and that I am the luckiest man alive because of it. I will never take you for granted. Not for a single second. I will wake up every day thanking God that I have been given you, and I will go to bed every night knowing that nothing—nothing—in this world could ever compare to the gift of your love.

So hear me when I say this—I will never stop showing up for you. Not just in the grand moments, but in the quiet ones. Not just when it’s easy, but when it’s hard. Not just today, not just tomorrow, but for as long as I have breath in my lungs.

I am yours. And I always will be.

Forever and beyond,

The man who is blessed to call you mine.",5,1738531873.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

To the woman who is my heart, my home, my everything,

Loving you is not just a choice I make—it is who I am. It is woven into every breath I take, every thought that lingers in my mind, every beat of my heart that only seems to make sense when it is beating for you. You are not just the love of my life—you are my life, the reason I look toward every tomorrow with purpose, with gratitude, with unwavering devotion.

I want you to know that there is no mountain too high, no storm too fierce, no darkness too heavy that I would not walk through for you. I would stand in the face of anything this world throws your way and fight for you, protect you, shield you from every pain, every doubt, every moment of fear. When the weight of the world feels too much, when the burdens try to bend you, you will never carry them alone. I will be there. I will stand beside you, my strength wrapping around you, my love anchoring you through it all.

But love is not only found in the battles we fight—it is also in the quiet moments, the ones that truly define a life shared. I will be there not just in the hard times, but in the beautiful ones, the simple ones, the moments that turn into memories we will cherish for a lifetime. I will be the one who brings you coffee (even though I can’t stand it) in the morning just the way you like it, who kisses your forehead before you even open your eyes.

Seems like something actually went quite wrong here.,"https://preview.redd.it/6tpnwr5pisge1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d4fab4fd175c44faa094ac02f6cab01bf0b4399

TLDR:  Truck was RWD only with power limited to 56% after a somewhat discombobulated DCFC session.  No errors, warnings, or DTCs.  Then without explanation, 18 hrs, two L2 charge sessions and 4 drives later, it’s back to normal with no intervention.

Yesterday (Saturday) morning we woke up here in Calgary to -12C (10F).  As we headed out the door to hit the slopes in Banff, the truck only had 92% SOC, so I knew a stop in Canmore on the way home was going to be necessary.

Departure time had been set.  Battery was preheated and throughout the drive, the truck managed to keep the battery temp close to optimal and power available was more or less what I would expect on a cold day as the SOC gets eaten up with highway driving.  Power available started at about 93%, and dropping down about 75% as both SOC and outside temperatures fell.  Pretty normal stuff for a chilly day.  Reached the ski resort at 32% SOC.  My efficiency was a fairly abysmal 48 kWh/100 km (1.3 mi/kWh), but considering the high winds, cold temp, AT tires, and snow covered highway, not surprising at all.

Returned to the truck after skiing for the day and hit the road back to Calgary, with the plan to stop at an Electrify Canada station in Canmore for a 20-30 min charge.  Battery was cold now from sitting in the parking lot all day.  Temperature had dropped to -18C (0F) so power available had been cut to 70%.  By the time we reached Canmore it was down to -20C (-4F) as we pulled into the EC station with 20% SOC.  I had set the DCFC stop in the Ford nav so I am assuming that the battery had been preconditioned.

The first 150kW charging post would not start.  Said the truck was not initiating the charge session.  Moved to another 150kW post, and it started charging at an underwhelming 87 kW.  After 15 mins of painfully slow charging, the only 350kW post opened up so I moved over to it,  connected and began charging at a faster, but still rather paltry 127 kW.  No surprise though— while there are a few newer EC stations in Alberta that have been consistently delivering 180 kW charge sessions, this particular one is an older one so I have to take what I can get. It will be nice when my Tesla adapter arrives since Canmore has a SuperCharge station.  Maybe future Banff ski days go a bit smoother.

After 15 more mins plugged in the truck has now reached 70% SOC.  Even at 48 kWh/100 km (1.3 mi/kWh) I should have enough ions to get home with 15% to spare, so I unplugged and hit the road again.  But now, something seems to be wrong! Power is limited to 56% and although I would not realize it until the next morning, the front motor is not working at all.  I’m in RWD on black ice roads, making for a few holy shit moments on my way back to Calgary.  At this point I did not realize that I had lost AWD. I just thought that the roads had rapidly gotten that much worse due to the plummeting temps, high winds, and blowing snow.  The truck is driveable though, and I just need to get home. I wondered if the failed charging session, the abrupt disconnect from the slow cable, and switch over to the faster cable, combined with the super cold temperatures had perhaps triggered some kind of protection mode.  But no errors or warning messages had come up in the truck or in the app.

The other thing that soon became obvious is that BlueCruise will not activate.  I had used BC for a good part of the drive out (only on the stretches of road that were dry and clear), and it had worked, even with partially obscured lines. Now it won’t activate at all. Adaptive Cruise Control was working, but no BC.  I wasn’t too concerned though, since now the roads are much worse, and I probably would not have used BC anyways.  Just thought it was strange that it wouldn’t kick in at all.

The next morning (Sunday), I wake up to -25C (-13F). The truck has been on the driveway plugged in all night, and has charged up to 76%.  I discover that I am all out of coffee filters so I set a departure time in the app, the truck pre-heats the battery and cabin, I put on my warm clothes and head out the door.  I am expecting that with the truck plugged in all night, and a departure time set, everything would be back to normal.  I was expecting the typical 80-90% power limit that is typical on cold days like this.  But no, it is still limited to 56%!  Battery temp is right there at the center of the gauge, but something is still not right.  Now it also becomes obvious to me that I have no AWD.  I turn on the power distribution gauge and any press of the accelerator pedal is only activating the rear motor! I am driving a RWD half ton on the worst roads of the winter so far.  White knuckle trip to get coffee filters and those holy shit moments from last nights drive home are making more sense.  But still no error messages or warnings.  Just no front motor.

When I get home from getting my filters, I decide it’s time to plug in the OBDII adapter, and check for DTCs. So I grab my iPad and go back out to the truck which has been parked on the street and not plugged in for 5 mins or so.  I hop in, turn it on, and wait… what??  Everything is suddenly back to normal.  93% power available.  Front motor is working again.  AWD is back!

OBD scan finds no DTCs other than a few archived ones, which I think were related to repeated orange wrench lights I was getting for months, but that I think has now been resolved with some updates recently performed by the dealership.

Have any of you had this happen before?  Any idea what might have happened?  All seems back to normal now, but pretty concerning that the truck goes into what appeared to be a failsafe mode leaving me with RWD only, at a time when AWD is more needed than at any other time, with no warning or explanation.  No indication at all that I don’t have AWD.  Shouldn’t there have at least been an indicator in the instrument cluster telling me that I only have rear wheel drive???    This is seems like a massive safety problem if you ask me.  Taking away AWD with no indication to the driver??  I am definitely going to report this to my dealer, but I also kinda feel like transportation safety needs to know about this.",1,1738531748.0,F150Lightning,4,1.0,False

Let’s debunk some of the most common myths about track days and show you what to really expect when you attend one of our events.

**Myth #1: You Need a Race Car to Participate**

Many people believe that track days are only for professional racers with fully prepped race cars. This couldn't be further from the truth! At Infinite Motorsports, our lapping days are open to a wide range of vehicles, from daily drivers to high-performance sports cars. As long as your car is in good mechanical condition and meets basic safety requirements, you can experience the thrill of high-performance driving on a world-class racetrack.

**Myth #2: Track Days Are Too Dangerous**

While high-performance driving naturally comes with an element of risk, Infinite Motorsports takes extensive safety precautions to ensure a controlled and secure environment. Our track days are run with strict rules, professional instructors, and on-site safety teams to minimize risks. We provide clear guidelines, structured sessions, and driver briefings to ensure that everyone on the track knows how to operate safely. In fact, lapping days can be a safer way to explore the limits of your vehicle compared to spirited driving on public roads.

**Myth #3: Only Experienced Drivers Can Attend**

One of the biggest misconceptions about lapping days is that they are only suited for advanced drivers. At Infinite Motorsports, we welcome drivers of all skill levels, from complete beginners to seasoned pros. If you're new to high-performance driving, our track days include a full day of in-car coaching, giving you the chance to learn from experienced instructors. We also organize run groups based on skill level so that everyone can drive at a pace they’re comfortable with.

**Myth #4: Track Days Will Damage Your Car**

A well-maintained vehicle will perform just fine during a track day. The key is to perform basic pre-event maintenance, such as checking tire pressures, brake fluid, and oil levels. Unlike competitive racing, our lapping days are designed to let drivers push their cars in a controlled environment without the aggressive conditions of wheel-to-wheel racing. Many participants find that regular track days actually help them become more in tune with their car’s handling and performance.

**Myth #5: Track Days Are Too Expensive**

While motorsports can be an expensive hobby, participating in an Infinite Motorsports track day is more affordable than many people think. With amount of seat time, instruction, and safe environment provided, combined with including helmet rentals, breakfast, coffee/tea, beverages all day and an afternoon snack, our lapping days offer excellent value. Not to mention, when compared to the cost of speeding tickets, demerit points, and potential road hazards, spending a day on the track is a much smarter investment for those who love high-performance driving

1ig8156,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1ig8156/a_complete_review_of_my_very_first_cruise_part_1/,A Complete Review of My VERY FIRST CRUISE - Part 1,"From Dec 15 to Dec 22, 2024 - just one week before Christmas - I (35 F) and my husband (41 M) sailed on *Symphony of the Seas* on our very first cruise. I absolutely loved the whole experience, so I am here to share some of it. 

We flew from Brazil the night before and the 8-hour commute by plane was totally worth it!

It was a seven-night cruise, departing from Miami and visiting four ports (Cococay, Labadee, Falmouth and Nassau - respectively). We had two sea days.

The ship is absolutely stunning! It’s massive, clean, so well-designed and full of art - I especially loved taking the stairs just to check out the different paintings on each floor - such a cool detail.

The staff mentioned the ship was sailing at full capacity, but I couldn’t believe it because it NEVER felt crowded!!! And I say this as someone who hates crowds and was worried about having to face an always-crowed ship on my vacation. There were always places to sit, lounges to sunbathe and tables to eat at the buffets. And the lines for the attractions I tried, like ice skating, water slides, the Ultimate Abyss, and the zip line were always short. This made my experience so pleasant. 

The Promenade was always the busiest spot on the ship, but if you just headed up to the Schooner Bar, over to the Boardwalk, or into Central Park, peace and quiet were found again. 

Like most people, my favorite was Central Park - so relaxing and beautiful! But I also loved the running track portion at the very back of the ship where you can seat peacefully and just watch the sea. 

**EMBARKATION**

I was up at midnight, 30 days before my cruise, to successfully get the earliest check-in time - 10h30. And being able to embark the earliest possible made it worth it.

I left my hotel in Miami at 10h00. I still got some traffic to arrive in the port, but I made it in about 30 minutes. 

The porters quickly and easily collected our luggage, and we went straight to check-in. I had already printed and attached the tags Royal Caribbean sent me - two per bag in case one fell off - just paper, nothing fancy like those plastic waterproof ones everybody tells us to buy!

Already inside RC terminal, everything was incredibly fast. SO FAST. Before we knew it, we were on the ship! 

As a first-time cruiser, this moment felt surreal.

We got on the ship with just our carry-ons. Very first thing we did was go to our Muster Station. Then, we went to the Main Dining Room to check our (amazing) table, and finally, we headed to the Solarium for lunch. It was not crowded and the crew members were very welcoming. 

A Pinnacle member must have spotted my ""first-timer"" vibes because she came over and gave me some great food tips (lobsters and seafood!). She was so sweet… Reddit made me think they were all jerks, lol.

After lunch, we hung out in the beautiful Solarium, already sunbathing, until 1:00 PM when the rooms opened so we could drop off our stuff. Honestly, carrying our carry-ons around wasn’t a big deal at all, I thought it would be annoying, but it went well. 

With our bags out of the way, we set off to explore the ship and learn our way around. We started at the top and made our way down in a zig-zag. We walked a lot! My husband even pointed out how funny it was that we were walking on a cruise ship just as much as we do when we travel to historic cities.

Before 4 pm, our bags were at our door. The gangway was up at 3h30pm but the ship didn’t leave port until around 6 pm - we were the last one. It was really cool to see all others ships passing by us and waving goodbye while we were in our private ocean view balcony. When we realized we were moving, it was an amazing moment, something every first-timer will never forget!

**CABIN**

Being first-time cruisers, we were concerned about sea sickness and feeling too confined. Because of that, after some research, our choice was a Midship Oceanview Balcony on Deck 10. It was a great choice - easy to come and go, quiet, didn’t experience much motion, and felt as comfortable as a hotel room. Actually, we got a Large Oceanview Balcony, because when I booked through the Royal Caribbean website, the Large Balcony option was cheaper than the regular one - I’m not sure why. 

The cabin was big enough for the two of us, and there was plenty of space to keep all our stuff very well organized. However, I can't see it being shared by three or four people comfortably - but that’s just my opinion.

The bed was pretty good - and due to all the complaints I read, I was afraid it was going to be uncomfortably hard and that a mattress topper would be necessary. Seriously, it was even kind of soft for me.

I only needed to request two extra pillows and more hangers - I left a note on a post it for our room attendant on the first day. I also let him know what would be the best time to clean our room according to his schedule. He kindly fulfilled all our requests, and during our seven-night stay, we got three towel animals - which might seem silly to mention, but it is a nice (and cute) touch I suppose everyone loves!

My husband and I didn’t spend much time on the balcony eating, drinking, sunbathing, or chatting, but I’m not sure I could cruise again without one. It became our strongest connection to the sea. We would just leave the curtains open while we were showering, getting dressed, napping and the sea was always just there. 

Every morning, just after waking up, I had to step out there to see where we were or just take in the view. Every night, before bed, I’d watch the nearly complete darkness of the sea - it was both stunning and intimidating. 

We also sailed away from our balcony, which felt so cool. Having an Oceanview Balcony was like having our own private spot whenever we wanted - dressed in our pjs, brushing my hair to get ready, brushing our teeth after meals... all while looking out at the vast ocean. Also, I loved observing the other ships docked next to us in port, especially since it was my first time seeing all of them.

Finally, I think it’s worth mentioning that I didn’t spend any money on all the stuff people tell us, first time cruisers, to buy as cabin enhancements: magnet hooks, over the door organizers, power strips, white noise machines, etc… Honestly, I didn’t feel like I needed any of those items, and I’m glad I didn’t spend the extra money because they weren’t missed at all.

**FOOD and BEVERAGES**

I wa*s* really worried about the food. I’ve seen so many people complain about it - on Reddit, Facebook, and YouTube! They are always saying it is bad, cold, poor quality, mediocre and that you must go to the restaurants that cost extra to enjoy a decent meal. I'm so glad I didn’t listen to them!

Well, I simply loved all the food on the ship, all of it - and I only ate at the included restaurants! 

As a first-time cruiser, I decided to stick to the ""free"" options before spending extra money on specialty dining, and honestly, it was the best decision I could have made.

**Solarium Bistro**

The best spot for breakfast and lunch! It is beautiful, quieter and far less chaotic than the Windjammer. Plus, the food selection is really good - high-quality, fresh and warm.

There was lobster and other premium sea food on embarkation lunch. On my next cruise, I’m definitely sticking to the Solarium for meals.

**Windjammer**

There are more options here than the Solarium, but it is more crowded and chaotic. Though, I never found myself looking for a table or standing in line, not even once. I had both breakfast and lunch there, and the food was always good, fresh, and warm. I’ve read so many complaints about the Windjammer - people calling it disgusting, with cold or tasteless food - but that wasn’t my experience at all. Everything I tried was good and people were respecting the norms of hygiene.

**Main Dining Room**

I LOVED THE MAIN DINING ROOM. Can I say it again? I loved the Main Ding Room.

My husband and I had dinner there every evening. Again, I’ll admit, I was nervous at first because I’d seen so many complaints claiming the food didn’t taste good or was served cold.  I was especially worried because my husband values the food experience so much during our trips. Since I’m the one who plans everything, I was afraid he’d blame me for picking a bad cruise line with terrible food. Thankfully, our experience was the complete opposite! 

Everything tasted good, or very good, and the food was always served hot. In fact, sometimes the plates were so hot I couldn’t even touch them. The menu had options for everyone, and they were super accommodating with any special requests we had. And before anyone assumes we don’t know what “good food” is - let me stop you right there. In Brazil, where we’re from, we enjoy amazing meals made with fresh, high-quality ingredients, especially seafood and beef. On top of that, we love traveling to Europe and exploring different cuisines, so we definitely know what great food tastes like.

The dishes were really rich in flavor, the proteins were all cooked perfectly and the desserts were both beautiful and delicious. 

The cherry on the top of our experience was our table. As it was only my husband and me, I emailed Royal Caribbean 30 days before the cruise to request a table just for the two of us. I also explained I didn’t want one of those “tables for two” that are lined up so close to others it feels like you’re part of a giant table full of couples. So I requested them a table preferably by the handrail and possibly with a view of the chandelier or the whole dining room. And that’s exactly the table they gave us. Throughout the week, a couple of staff members and even a few passengers stopped by to say things like, “Wow! You’ve got a great table!” or “Best seats in the house!”. It was such a thoughtful gesture from the MDR staff, and it meant so much to me as a first-time cruiser with no status or significance to them.

And finally, the service: absolutely amazing - impeccable. Our waiters were simply the best! They were kind, funny, and, most importantly, incredibly helpful. Chatting with them every evening was such a highlight, and we even got some great insider tips about the ship and the ports. The service was also impressively fast. Since it was just the two of us, we were often done in about 75 minutes. One night, we mentioned we had a show to catch, and they made sure we were out in just an hour.

We had the second seating at 7:30 PM every night, and it worked perfectly for us. It allowed us to return from the ports without rushing, take a shower, have a quick nap, and get dressed for dinner and the shows after it. Sometimes, we even had time to enjoy the evening activities before dinner, like jazz in Central Park or piano at the Schooner Bar.

The dining room was neither noisy nor crowded, it was always a relaxing place to enjoy a good conversation. We also noticed that nobody really dressed up, even on formal night, which for us is something positive.

**Johnny Rockets** 

We tried it for the complimentary breakfast only, and I didn't like it. The options were very limited and service was quite slow. I am glad I tried it on a sea day, otherwise I would have been late to leave the ship to enjoy the ports. I did check the menu beforehand, but since I was determined to try all the included options, I still went, even knowing the menu was limited. The ambience was great, though - very calm and quiet in the beautiful, early-morning, empty Boardwalk. But honestly, that wouldn’t be enough to make me return on a future cruise…

**Sorrento’s**

Good pizza! Always fresh and always waiting for us at any time of the day - after port excursions and late shows were my favorite times to grab a slice (or two!). Sometimes the lines were super long, but they moved so quickly I didn't have time to complain.

**Park Café**

Nice atmosphere, the best actually - in Central Park, but I only went there two or three times in the afternoon to grab some dessert or pick up some potato chips to bring to port with me. 

**Café Promenade**

As I enjoyed hanging out at the Schooner Bar, Café Promenade was the place to grab some pastries before Trivia. I really liked it.

**Ice Cream Stations**

Every time I returned from a port, I made sure to stop by for an ice cream cone. Again, if there were lines, they were fast-moving. Also, there are two ice cream stations, each on a different side of deck 15, I realized one always had a much longer line than the other, but I can’t recall which one it was - it might be worth checking out.

**Beverages**

This was one of the things I worried about, but once on the ship, I realized all my concerns were for nothing. My husband and I don’t drink alcohol, soda or coffee - so clearly the drinking package wasn’t for us. However, we do drink A LOT of water - and juice or tea.

I pre-purchased some Evian bottles through the Royal Caribbean app and brought 12 more bottles with me. Good idea, right? Nope! Totally unnecessary! Seriously - the free water offered by the ship tastes way better than the bottled water sold in the US - it is crisp and refreshing, with a clean, neutral taste. I should have just brought a bottle and refilled it (properly!) at the water stations that I saw in the Solarium, Windjammer, Sorrento’s, Hot Dog House and Park Cafe.

During breakfast, there was also orange juice available from the machines. In the Main Dining Room, we drank lemonade (and water!) every night, and it was completely fine. I noticed a lot of other tables doing the same - I thought we’d be the only ones without a drinking package, only drinking the complimentary beverages, but we definitely weren’t.

I didn’t spend money on beverages because I didn’t think it was necessary - though I had set aside some budget for fresh-squeezed juices, mocktails, and more bottled waters.

**PORTS**

I didn’t choose this sailing for the ports - it was all about the ship, my budget, and my vacation dates - but I was happy it included two Royal Caribbean private destinations, Cococay and Labadee.

I’d come across some harsh reviews about Falmouth and Nassau, but having never been to either, I was very open minded. While not everything was perfect, I’m glad I got to visit all these destinations.

Ah! I think it is worth mentioning - one thing newbies like me might not know: the gangway was on Deck 3, and there was always a towel station there with no lines. So, no need to carry towels down from the upper decks!

**Perfect Day at CocoCay, Bahamas**

Unfortunately, I did not have a Perfect Day at Cococay due to bad weather. When the gangway first opened, we stepped off the ship, but within 5 minutes, the heaviest rain began, and we rushed back on board. After waiting three hours, we gave it another try.

The weather alternated between 30 minutes of sunshine and 30 minutes of light rain, wind, and cloudy skies - repeating until we left. We did our best to enjoy it - after all, a rainy day on a private destination in the Bahamas is still better than a sunny day at work back at home, right? 

We spent most of our day in South Beach, but in my opinion, Chill Island was prettier. 

For lunch, we decided to eat on our beach chairs so we grabbed food from Snack Shack - this was the only time during the entire cruise I had to wait a long time for something… Hamburgers, hot dogs, fries, mozzarrella sticks and cookies were all very good though - but if I knew I would stand that much in line, I would have headed to the buffet instead.

I just wanted a chill beach day, so I did not purchase any excursions or extras in CocoCay. 

**Labadee, Haiti**

Hands down our favorite port. It is insanely beautiful and has a very good structure for passengers. I think I’d still choose it over CocoCay, even if the weather there had been great. Very important to say that I felt very safe there, and would definitely book another cruise that stops in Labadee. Also, the fact that food and beverages in the buffet were included in the cruise fare makes it a win-win destination for me.

When we got there, we hopped on the shuttle and went straight to Columbus Cove. There were plenty of chairs and we got front-row seats. I spent most of the day there, and it was the most beautiful beach on this cruise itinerary! Later in the day, I took a walk over to Adrenaline Beach. Unfortunately, I missed out on the trails I wanted to explore because I didn’t plan my time well. Oh, and I skipped the vendor’s market because of all the stories about pushy sellers I’d read here and on Facebook.

It was a Perfect Day at Labadee for me!

Well, actually, there was one little problem - caused by a passenger - this woman who simply took one of our lounge chairs AND the towel on it! 

We left our place for about fifteen minutes just to grab some food and drinks from the buffet, when we came back, one of our chairs was gone - there was just an empty spot. At first, it was kind of confusing. Then, the passengers sitting next to us pointed out the lady who did that. She had grabbed our chair and set it in the water to sunbathe. 

My mouth was wide open - not only because she took my chair, but also because she placed it in the water. I mean, what if everyone started dragging chairs into the water? I find this kind of attitude very disrespectful.

When I approached her, she claimed there wasn’t a towel on the chair -  which wasn’t true! I couldn’t believe what was happening, but at that point, I was more worried about the missing towel than the chair -  obviously, I didn’t want to pay $25 for a lost towel! She did have an extra towel with her, but when I asked, she said it belonged to her daughter, who wasn’t there at the moment - I didn’t believe a word she said, but I decided not to push it further. Instead, I looked for a Royal Caribbean employee, told them my story and they checked out a new towel for me without any hassle. Problem solved, but I couldn’t believe someone would actually pull something like that.

**Falmouth, Jamaica**

I didn’t have high expectations for Falmouth since everything I read about it was pretty negative.

At first, I booked an excursion to Dunn’s River Falls and the Blue Hole, but after thinking it through, I switched to an All-Inclusive resort - both through RCCL. The original excursion had a 90-minute commute each way, so we’d spend three hours total inside a bus - and we didn’t have much time in the port! So, without ever having been there, but based on a few YouTube videos, we came to the conclusion it wouldn’t be worth it.

We went to Hilton Rose Hall instead, which was only 20 minutes away. We had a nice beach day, their pools were cool, and food, drinks, towels, lockers and wifi were all included (the royal Caribbean excursion team didn’t tell us about the inclusions of the last three as they didn’t know about them). Their drinks, just mocktails for us, were really good, but their food was pretty bad - completely tasteless.

We had a good time there, but time went by so quickly that it felt like it was time to leave before we even realized it (or wanted!). So, again, because of the short time, I was happy we didn’t do the far excursion (Dunn’s and Blue Hole). 

Here, things ended on a weird note. On the bus back, my husband and I had to sit separately, he was up front and I ended up in the back - no big deal since the ride was short. The problem was when we left the bus at the port. My husband got off before I did, tipped the guide and stepped aside to wait for me. When I got off, I didn’t tip because I knew my husband was the one supposed to do so. I just looked at the guys and said “Thank you very much!”. At this moment, the driver looked me straight in the eye and asked if I wasn’t going to tip the guide. I never felt so embarrassed.  My husband did jump in to say he had already tipped for both of us, but the driver’s answer was “Oh, tips are per couple now?”. What? I mean… aren’t they? I wanted to say something but my husband just pulled me by the hand as he got mad. We left feeling confused and awkward, but later on the ship, we figured he was either trying to take advantage of us since he realized we weren’t Americans (and don’t fully understand how tipping works), or maybe he was just desperate (it is a very poor country, after all).

If we ever stop in Falmouth again, we’d probably just stay on the ship. The good excursions are too far or expensive, and the time in port is too short - also, that last experience left a bitter taste.  

By the way, hundreds of passengers (yes, hundreds!) didn’t make it back on time because of heavy traffic. But since most of them were on RC excursions, the captain announced that the ship would wait for them.

Honestly, I don’t think there was much traffic, I think there wasn’t much time for the excursions they sold, but they sold them anyway and had to deal with delays.

**Nassau, Bahamas**

Well, I know people seem to hate Nassau - I’ve read so many negative things - but honestly, I had such a good time there. My husband even said it was his favorite port!

I booked an excursion through RC to Baha Bay Water Park. I originally wanted to visit Atlantis, but since it wasn’t available through RC and I had some onboard credit to spend, I chose Baha Bay - and I’m so glad I did! I absolutely loved it. 

The excursion was super organized from start to finish, and the short commute was a bonus. Lunch, Wi-Fi, towels, water park access, and beach access (with chairs and umbrellas) were all included. The only thing we had to pay for was the lockers (U$15 Standard/U$20 Family) - which has to be done at the entrance, otherwise, you’ll have to walk all the way back. The place runs completely cashless, so we made sure to have a card with us.

All the lines were short, so we had no trouble going on all the slides and even repeating our favorites. We also spent some relaxing time on the beach. The only thing I didn’t like was that the water was not heated, it was freezing!  But everything else was organized, clean and beautiful. At lunch, we had three included options, we picked the easiest one: hamburgers, fries, and soda - it was huge and really good!

Also, I should mention the port itself - it felt really safe and well-organized too,  which made the whole experience even better.

**ENTERTAINMENT**

Gosh! I would sail Symphony of the Seas again just for the entertainment! The shows, singers, bands, onboard activities like trivia and game shows were absolutely top-notch.

I booked ALL the shows in advance, and when HiRO got canceled on the first night and rescheduled for the same evening as 1977, Guest Services helped me make a few little adjustments.

Everyone with a reservation could enter the venues about 30 minutes early, so the best seats were quickly taken. After that, they let people in without reservations, and everyone got in, no one was turned away. When I say “best seats,” though, I don’t mean the rest were bad, they were still great!

It was funny that the crew member checking reservations recognized me for going to all the shows, and at the last one, she laughed and said I’d completed the bingo card!

There’s only one thing I really hated during the shows: people ordering drinks and the waiters (not their fault!) having to deliver them, blocking the view and making you stand up so they could pass - all while the show was going on.

**Hairspray!**

My absolute favorite! I can’t get over it - I downloaded all the songs and flew back home listening to them. I’ve only seen two Broadway shows before, The Lion King and The Phantom of the Opera in NYC, but Hairspray has totally stolen the number one spot in my heart.

Even my husband, who hates musicals, and only watched because of me, absolutely loved it. Two nights later, he actually woke me up after I’d just fallen asleep to say, “Hairspray the other day was really cool, wasn’t it? I really liked it.” 

The cast was phenomenal, the theater was comfortable and beautiful, and the acoustics were amazing.

The conductor of the orchestra also played the piano at the Schooner Bar, where he performed Broadway hits. He shared some fun facts about the artists on the ship - like how their contracts last 12 months, and when they’re up, they have to audition all over again even if it is for the very same role (why?). Also, he mentioned that the artists are the only employees who don’t have to wear name tags at any time, and they get to enjoy the ship like passengers in their free time and even eat at the same restaurants.

Oh, and I met ""Tracy's Mom"" during *1977* one night! He told me they always try to catch each other's shows to support the team. He was the one clapping for his colleagues the loudest!

**1977 and iSkate 2.0**

The ice shows! Both shows are absolutely stunning and impressive. The movements, the performers, the sets, the costumes - everything was breathtaking.

1977 storyline is kind of confusing, but I didn’t mind because everything else was just amazing.

iSkate is the only show you don’t pre-book. Before my sailing, I actually asked in a Facebook group about i*Skate* not being available for pre-booking in the RC app. Then, some guy, who’s been on a thousand cruises and is chasing a pinnacle whatever, confidently said it wasn’t available because it wasn’t going to be on our sailing. Turns out, he was wrong!

Well, as it is known as “the other ice skating show,” I wasn’t too worried about missing it if it didn’t fit our evening schedule. But it did, and to my surprise, I actually liked it more than 1977!  It is less classic and more modern, and it has this different energy - more exciting. I’d definitely recommend watching both!

**Flight**

I liked it but I didn’t love it. It has the same actors from *Hairspray*, which I was totally in love with, so I really tried to like it a lot. The set was beautiful, the songs were cool, but the story didn’t grab me. It feels a bit more aimed at Americans, with all that patriotic vibe. It’s cool, but I wouldn’t call it a must-watch for foreigners. 

**HiRO**

I’d been looking forward to this show since I first saw it when *Oasis of the Seas* was launched and I was a teenager. I remember thinking, “Wow, one day I’m going to sail on this ship and watch that show.”

Well, it took me a while, but I finally sailed and watched the show on its twin. Unfortunately, I didn’t like it as much as I thought I would. Sure, the jumps are super impressive, and the music is cool, but there’s a lot of unimpressive dancing and way too much slackline - I really don’t like slackline, lol.

Don’t get me wrong, in the end, it’s a good show, but if you’ve seen some great shows in places like Vegas, it might not feel as amazing…

**Stand-Up Comedy**

I guess comedy shows can be hit or miss depending on the comedians and their mood that day, and how the audience reacts.

The first comedian started off strong, but then got boring - he seemed tired and kind of impatient.

The second comedian had only mild jokes, and some were dated, like “yesterday, my wife was in the kitchen while I was watching the game, and she couldn’t stop yelling…”. I mean, seriously? Whose wife is still in the kitchen during a game? It’s not 1992 anymore. But he did look old, so I guess that explains it.

As a fan of roasts and stand-up, I was expecting more. Again, it wasn’t bad, just kind of meh… maybe it could have been something I skipped.

**Crazy Quest Game Show**

Everyone said this was a must-watch, but no one really explained what to expect. Since it was our first time, we decided to sit in the back, especially after realizing some people came super prepared for it.

Before the game started, there was an auction which a guy got the chance to “drive(?)” the ship for $1500. The money went to Make-A-Wish, and they mentioned it had never been done, a passenger had never controlled the ship. Is that true?

Once the game started, my husband and I couldn’t stop laughing. We had a blast! It was such a fun mix of funny and cringe-worthy moments. I would definitely go and watch it again next time. 

**Trivia**

I didn’t expect this to become a thing for me, but I ended up joining Trivia several days, and I thought it was so fun! I even won one of them, the Central Perk trivia about Friends!!! It is a cool way of chatting with people, spending time and laughing at how dumb we actually are, lol. 

**ACTIVITIES**

**Zip Line**

Yeah, it’s super short, but it is thrilling! The crew members working on it are very gentle and you can notice how focused they are on safety, which makes us fell good.

**Ice Skating**

Ice skating on a cruise in the Caribbean was such a fun experience! 

I noticed the crew running it are actually the same artists from the ice skating show. This was the longest line I had to wait in on the ship, about 30 minutes in the afternoon of a sea day - just to have a group time assigned. Later, when it is your turn, you get 20 minutes to skate, which is just the right amount to enjoy it and then move on to the next activity.

I also saw a lot of people getting turned away because they weren’t wearing long pants, so keep that in mind.

**Water Slides**

Before trying them, I thought they would be kinda silly, for kids to have fun. I was absolutely wrong! They are AMAZING! The blue one is completely dark, and the green one is really thrilling. My favorite part was coming back from the port and heading straight to the water slides - the lines were short and my hair was already all messy after a beach day. After trying all three, I grabbed an ice cream cone and went to my room to shower. 

And even after spending the day at Baha Bay Water Park in Nassau, I went to the slides as soon as I got back on the ship. Honestly, they were just as fun as the ones at the water park.

**Ultimate Abyss**

It looks way scarier than it actually is. The ride down felt pretty slow, almost like sliding in slow motion, so I only tried it once - it wasn’t that much fun.

**Pools**

The only pools I tried were the small ones in the Solarium… they were cool. And they were always empty - people prefer the hot tubs.

**Solarium**

I simply loved the Solarium. It was my go-to area for sunbathing and relaxing. On sea days, it was busy, but never noisy - and there were always chairs available . Also, the proximity to the Solarium Bistro was great, because I could always grab some desserts to eat on my chair. 

**Art Exhibition**

Having the chance to see an art exhibition on a cruise ship is really cool. My husband and I spent some quality time looking at the paintings and joking about which ones we would get if we were rich, lol. The artwork on our sailing was really beautiful.

**Mini Golf**

I played it on a sea day, and even though there were a lot of people, there was plenty of space for everyone to enjoy their game without getting in each other’s way. That was really cool.

**Laser Tag, SHUSH and Rock Climbing**

These are the three things I didn’t get to do, but I wish I had! I did A LOT on this ship and there was still more left to try.  

Laser Tag only happened on port days, and I was always off at the beach or on an excursion. 

SHUSH was always in the evening, it happened at the same time of some show we wanted to watch or later at night when we were super tired and just wanted to sleep.

As for Rock Climbing, it was the only one I didn’t really organize myself to do, I always thought I would do it later or next day, and then the cruise was over… 

But I don’t feel bad about any of it. Every time I skipped something, it was because I was having an amazing time doing something else!

**DUCKS**

It was our first cruise and we don’t have any children - so, before boarding Symphony, I wasn’t too interested when I read about finding and hiding ducks on ships… at that time, I couldn’t care less. That is, until I spotted my first duck sitting on a sanitizer dispenser by the elevator - it made me SO happy! I felt like a child again.

All this joy made me pay closer attention wherever I went and drag my husband into it. It was super fun!

We found two more ducks in Central Park, and my husband spotted an elephant-shaped one on the ceiling of the Schooner Bar while stretching and looking up during Trivia. I almost screamed when he showed me! We didn’t go full-on duck hunting, but it’s definitely something I’d love to do on our next cruise. I can see it being even more fun with kids.

Yep, I still haven’t finished…

Week 1: 186.4 lbs    BP: 120/85

Day 0: technically day 1, but I’m not counting this as I took my shot before bed. 

Day 1: dry mouth, thirsty, small headache, hungry but no urge to eat. Slight nausea in the morning that subsided. Not unbearable. Happier mood (I’ve been off of Lexapro for a week and have been feeling really depressed up until today). I had a sinus infection, which may explain the headache and nausea. Size 6 pants will not button. Avoiding jeans for now. 

Day 2: no headache. Muscle strength normal. No hunger. Happy mood. Feeling lighter. Full after eating one chicken breast. I typically retain water weight easily, but that’s not the case today. Very focussed and clear minded. I had two hot dogs (no bun) broccoli, and a small side of Mac and cheese for dinner because I cooked for my kids but not myself. I was overly full. 

Day 3. Hungry around noon so I had a sushi roll. I am full off of one, despite normally needing at least 3. No hunger in the evening. I am retaining fluid. Constipated. No nausea or headache. Emotional. Had a chicken breast for dinner but couldn’t finish it. Dealing with bad depression. Very swollen. Lots of water weight by 10pm. 

Day 4: energized. Happy. No more constipation. Heart rate got to 206 BPM and stayed above 200 on the stair master. Not very hungry today. Metal taste in mouth. Energized and focussed. A pair of my yoga pants fit much better than they did last week. I had spaghetti and meatballs. The portion of pasta was the same size as a side of Chick-fil-A Mac n cheese. 

Day 5: 178lbs (I got a little excited and weighed myself). Tired. Not thinking clearly. I accidentally put things in wrong places. I put plastic in the oven (house almost caught on fire). I had sushi for lunch and a turkey wrap for dinner. I ate it all. 

Day 6: headache. Sinus infection. Fatigued. Eating slightly more. Swollen with fluid on my body. I had a turkey wrap that I ate throughout the day. I also had a half of an apple as a snack. I drank a Starbucks coffee (yes it had sugar. I was craving something sweet). I drank more water today. At 4pm, I am more irritated and tired.

On Great Fields: The Life and Unlikely Heroism of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain by Ronald C White.

I was first interested in Chamberlain after watching his portrayal by Jeff Daniels in the movie, Gettysburg, many years ago. All that I knew about him was he commanded the 20th Maine at Gettysburg and held the extreme left of the Union line on Little Round Top and that he became Governor of Maine and a college president after the Civil War.

White tells the rest of his life story that was fair and balanced. Chamberlain became noted for his steadiness during some challenging times and his lauded character and principles.

I give my reviews a ‘coffee cup’ rating from 1 to 5 and for this book I give it a ☕☕☕☕ review.

How The Light Gets In by Louise Penny. 

Penny’s Inspector Gamache series is brilliant! This is the ninth installment in the series and it finds Gamache facing a confrontation with his boss and group of corrupt officers and officials. You see it coming from chapters away. The novel ends in dramatic fashion and is a major turning point in the series.

Penny’s ability to have multiple storylines in not just one book, but across multiple books in the series, adds to the depth of them. This one resolves some of those storylines.

☕☕☕☕☕review


The Long Way Home by Louise Penny.

This is the tenth in the Inspector Gamache series and finds Gamache retired after the events of the last book. 

He now lives in the village of Three Pines, with his wife and German Shepherd. But, a missing husband, who promised to return after a year of separation to assess the marriage, fails to do so. The result is a journey from Three Pines Quebec to Scotland, Toronto, and into the deep woods of Quebec itself.

Again, Penny’s cast of characters, is wonderful and the growing uncertainty and anxiety of the Gamache and company, adds a lot of depth to the story. A signature Penny touch, the slow, gradual, unfolding of the plot, is on display as backstories, are told and unfolded.

This edition, marks a turn in the series and it will be interesting to see where the storyline goes now.

African Kaiser: General Paul Von Lettow-Vorbeck and the Great War in Africa, 1914-1918.

Much has been written about, and continues to be written about, the Great War, World War 1. The focus of which has been on the Western Front. I knew that military operations took place in Africa as well and as I searched for another book on WW1, found this one.

It is the story of a German General, who leads a small group of both white and black troops, in East Africa, against an Allied force that grows larger to achieve the goal of requiring more troops to be sent to defeat him and thus channel Allied troops away from the Western Front. But it is also the story of characters, on both sides, some remembered and some forgotten, some white and some black, who fought not just against one another but also against, the harsh climate of Africa. The resourcefulness of Lettow-Vorbeck and his troops, is an interesting part of the story.

Lettow-Vorbeck is never caught and surrenders only after learning about the Armistice. He lives into his 90’s and through WW2 and the animosity of Hitler whom he did not support.

I (20F) and my roommate (22F) have been living in our apartment for over 5 months. We used to live in another apartment but recently switched because the rent was just getting too much for us to pay,we never had problems with our old neighbors so we werent used to neighbors telling us off whenever we made too much noise.

 
A couple of months ago we were talking in our room and we heard a bang on the wall,it was from our neighbors telling us to stfu,do we stopped talking and went to bed.The following nights whenever we wanted to talk we would go into the living room se we dont disturb our neighbors.A couple of days after they banged on the wall,we were leaving to go get coffee and when we opened the door we noticed there was a letter stuck on our door.It said “Dear neighbors,could you please be more quiet after 11pm since we have to get up early for work and we try to be as quiet as possible for you as well since our bedrooms are connected” and we respect that and apologized that we were being inconsiderate.

Fast forward 2 months,last night i was laying in bed and my roommate was sleeping on the couch on the living room since she got sick and didnt want for me to catch her cold.I was laying in bed silently just scrolling through Tiktok (wearing headphones)i heard three bangs on the wall,it was the neighbors telling us to stfu again but i got confused since no one was making noise but i didnt say anything.

This morning at around 7:30 am i was asleep and i kept hearing birds right outside my window but drifted back to sleep three  minutes later i heard the loudest bangs ever and honestly i was fucking terrified i thought someone was coming to murder us and i know it sounds stupid but i was half asleep.So i decided to do the same thing that they did to us and write a letter to them as well.I wrote “Dear neighbors,i understand that from our previous encounters that the noise that was coming from our side this morning may have sounded like we were doing something but we just wanted to inform you that we dont have control of birds and dont ask them to bother you on purpose please refrain from making noise that early in the morning since you scared us half to death this morning,respectfully the neighbors next to you”

---------------------------------------------------------------

Having an organized kitchen can transform your cooking experience from chaotic to enjoyable. With the rise of online shopping, finding the right **Amazon home organizers** for your kitchen is easier than ever. Here are some creative ways to utilize these organizers and make the most out of your kitchen space.

One way to organize your kitchen effectively is by investing in **stackable storage bins**. These bins come in various sizes and can help manage pantry items, snacks, or even cooking supplies. You can stack them vertically, maximizing your shelf space. When arranging these bins, sort items by category. For instance:

- **Baking supplies:** Keep flour, sugar, and baking soda together.
- **Snacks:** Store chips, granola bars, and dried fruit in one place.
- **Canned goods:** Label and stack these for easy access.

Utilizing a **pull-out spice rack** is another clever way to enhance your kitchen's organization. Instead of having your spices take up space in a cabinet, a pull-out rack allows easy visibility and access. You can position it next to your stove, making it convenient when cooking. A labeled spice rack not only improves organization but also adds a professional touch to your kitchen.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/amazon-home-organizers-kitchen  
  
Another innovative solution is to use **magnetic organizers**. These can be attached to the sides of your refrigerator or any metallic surface. Here’s how you can use them:

- **Utensil holder:** Keep cooking utensils within reach.
- **Knife strip:** Store knives safely and accessibly.
- **Notepad holder:** Jot down grocery lists or recipe ideas right on the fridge.

For those looking to add more vertical storage, consider using **over-the-door organizers**. These are great for maximizing space on cabinet doors or even pantry doors. You can store cleaning supplies, cutting boards, or even wraps and bags. With this setup, you can maintain a clutter-free countertop while keeping essential items close at hand.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/amazon-home-organizers-kitchen  
  
Kitchen carts can serve as multi-functional **home organizers**. They can be used as additional prep space, a coffee station, or even a place for serving snacks. If you find a cart with shelves, you can use them to hold cookbooks or display decorative items while keeping it functional. Just remember to keep your frequently used items on top for easy access.

A classic yet effective organization strategy includes using **drawer dividers**. This way, you can sort utensils, gadgets, and tools effectively. Drawer dividers make it easy to find what you need without rummaging through a messy pile. They come in different materials, from bamboo to plastic, so choose what fits best with your kitchen decor. Here’s what you can do:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/amazon-home-organizers-kitchen  
  
- **Utensil section:** Separate spoons, forks, and knives for quick use.
- **Gadgets section:** Keep measuring cups and can openers in one spot.
- **Miscellaneous section:** Store kitchen towels or oven mitts.

Utilizing clear storage containers is yet another brilliant way to streamline your space. They help with not only aesthetics but also allow you to see what's inside without opening each container. These are ideal for grains, pasta, or snack foods. Plus, many containers come with labels which help in maintaining organization.

If you find yourself constantly misplacing lids or containers, a **lid organizer** can be a lifesaver. This simple organizer can sit in a cabinet or drawer and keeps all your lids in one spot, ensuring you can find the right one quickly. These organizers are affordable and can significantly reduce frustrations in your daily cooking routine.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/amazon-home-organizers-kitchen  
  
Consider installing shelves or adding hanging storage for pots and pans. A pot rack or a shelf can free up cabinet space and add an attractive design element to your kitchen. Hanging pots in view creates easy access and often can be a decorative statement piece.

By implementing these creative solutions, you’ll not only keep your kitchen organized but also make cooking and entertaining a more enjoyable experience. Explore the wide range of options available on Amazon to find the perfect **home organizers** that match your style and needs.

Benefits of Organizing Your Kitchen for Improved Efficiency and Enjoyment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you tired of feeling overwhelmed every time you step into your kitchen? A cluttered space can make cooking feel like a chore rather than a joy. Organizing your kitchen can significantly improve not just your efficiency, but also your enjoyment. Here’s why putting your kitchen in order is a game changer.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/amazon-home-organizers-kitchen  
  
### Streamlined Cooking Experience

When everything has its designated place, cooking becomes a more seamless process. Here’s how a well-organized kitchen enhances your cooking experience:

- **Easy Access to Ingredients:** Keeping your spices, oils, and pantry items neatly labeled and easily reachable means you won’t waste time digging through clutter. You can grab what you need quickly and get straight to cooking.
- **Reduced Meal Prep Time:** Knowing where things are allows you to gather all your ingredients beforehand. This can cut your meal prep time in half, making it easier to prepare meals during busy evenings.
- **Less Cleanup Stress:** An organized kitchen is easier to clean. You'll know where your cleaning supplies are and can tackle messes quickly without feeling overwhelmed.

### Enhanced Creativity in Cooking

When your kitchen is neat and tidy, it encourages experimentation. Here’s how organization fuels your culinary creativity:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/amazon-home-organizers-kitchen  
  
- **Increased Visibility:** With everything in sight, you might spot those underused ingredients just waiting to shine. Discover hidden gems from your pantry or fridge that inspire you to try new recipes.
- **Freeing Up Mental Space:** A clutter-free environment allows your mind to focus on creating rather than searching. You’re more likely to try out new ideas when your workspace is inviting.
- **Better Meal Planning:** Organized kitchens let you see what you have at a glance. You can plan your meals better and reduce food waste, ultimately saving you money.

### Improved Safety and Comfort

Safety in the kitchen is crucial. Organizing not only makes cooking fun but also safe:

- **Minimized Injuries:** Items in designated spots reduce the chances of accidents. No more reaching awkwardly for a pan or spilling items from a crowded shelf.
- **More Personal Space:** An uncluttered kitchen feels more open and comfortable. You can move around freely, allowing you to enjoy every cooking session.
- **Better Ergonomics:** Arrange your tools and pots closer to where you need them most. This setup minimizes bending and stretching, which can lead to discomfort.

### Boosted Productivity

Let’s face it—most of us are busy. An organized kitchen can help you get things done:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/amazon-home-organizers-kitchen  
  
- **Time Management:** With everything in its place, you can get dinner on the table faster. Spend less time looking for items, and more time enjoying your meal with loved ones.
- **Encourages Cooking Regularly:** An efficient space encourages you to cook more at home. As you streamline the process, you'll find that whipping up healthy meals becomes a regular habit.
- **Inspires Family Participation:** A tidy kitchen is inviting for everyone. Family members—whether kids or adults—are more likely to jump in and help when the space looks organized.

### Long-term Financial Benefits

Investing time in organizing your kitchen can also pay off financially:

- **Reduced Food Waste:** When you know what you have, you can cook more efficiently and reduce waste. This means spending less money on groceries.
- **Longevity of Supplies:** Properly stored kitchen items last longer and maintain their quality. You'll find that you save money in the long run as you replace items less frequently.
- **Improved Resale Value:** If you ever decide to sell your home, a well-organized kitchen can significantly boost its appeal. Potential buyers appreciate a functional and tidy space.

These organization strategies can transform your kitchen into a space where cooking becomes a passion rather than a chore. Imagine entering a bright, clean kitchen where every tool and ingredient is easily accessible. By taking time to organize, you're not just improving efficiency—you're enhancing the very enjoyment of cooking.

### Conclusion

Embracing Amazon home organizers in your kitchen can transform not only the space but also your cooking experience. By utilizing creative storage solutions, such as tiered racks for pantry items or drawer dividers for utensils, you can maximize your kitchen's functionality. These organizers not only help in decluttering but also make it easier to find what you need, turning meal prep into a more enjoyable task.

I need to vent—and maybe get some advice. Like many of you, I’ve spent more nights than I’d care to admit staring at my computer screen, trying to translate a 45-minute session into something resembling a coherent note. Last month, I finally snapped and decided to let AI handle the grunt work. 

Let me start by saying I’m not tech-averse, but I’m also not the person who jumps on every new tool. I just wanted something that could *actually* understand the difference between a patient’s flat affect and their tangential thought process. Turns out, that’s a high bar.

Over a month, I trialed different AI scribes. Some felt like they were designed by people who’d never met a psychiatrist. Others showed promise but fell apart when things got nuanced. Here’s the review:

**Freed AI**

* *The Good*: Clean interface, decent for quick progress notes.
* *The Bad*: Tried to summarize a patient’s dissociative episode as “mild anxiety.” Also costs more than my monthly coffee budget.
* *Verdict*: Fine for simple cases, but it’s like using a toy stethoscope—cute, not clinical.

**Heidi Health**

* *The Good*: Custom templates let me build out MSE formats.
* *The Bad*: Once transcribed “suicidal ideation” as “surfing vacation.” Never again.
* *Verdict*: Good for billing help, but I don’t trust it with actual patient care.

**Nabla**

* *The Good*: Simple, fast, and free for basic use.
* *The Bad*: Notes read like a Twitter thread. Example: “Pt says life is hard. MD says try meds.”
* *Verdict*: Useful for med students? Maybe. For attendings? Hard pass.

**DeepScribe**

* *The Good*: Enterprise-level accuracy, integrates with Epic.
* *The Bad*: Requires a 12-step setup process and a sacrifice to the IT gods.
* *Verdict*: Great if you’re part of a hospital system. For private practice? Overkill.

**Augmedix**

* *The Good*: Real-time documentation during sessions.
* *The Bad*: Felt like having a stranger in the room. Also, $200/month for the privilege?
* *Verdict*: Cool tech, but the privacy ick factor is real.

**Notable**

* *The Good*: Voice-to-text is eerily accurate.
* *The Bad*: No psychiatry-specific templates. Spent an hour trying to teach it what “anhedonia” means.
* *Verdict*: Maybe in 2 years.

**Wavo Health**

* *The Good*: Actually understands psychiatry. Captured “flat affect with pressured speech” without me editing. Customizable templates for therapy notes, MSEs, and PRITE-style assessments. The patient dashboard (with mood/medication tracking) is *chef’s kiss*.
* *The Bad*: Takes \~60 seconds to generate notes. Not a dealbreaker, but I’ve side-eyed my clock a few times.
* *Verdict*: My daily driver now. It’s like the psychiatry resident I wish I had—attentive, thorough, but still needs supervision.

**Suki**

* *The Good*: Hands-free voice commands.
* *The Bad*: Misheard “lamotrigine” as “llama trigonometry” twice.
* *Verdict*: Fun for puns, bad for prescriptions.

**Twofold Health**

* *The Good*: Cheap, fast, and shockingly accurate for meds.
* *The Bad*: Ghosted therapy content. Entire CBT session summarized as “pt agrees to try mindfulness.”
* *Verdict*: Good for med management clinics, not for therapy.

**DAX (Nuance)**

* *The Good*: Dragon-backed, so you know it’s reliable.
* *The Bad*: Feels like using Windows 98. Also, $300/month? I’d rather hire a scribe.
* *Verdict*: Boomer tech with a Silicon Valley price tag.

  
Most AI scribes still treat psychiatry like it’s a checklist of symptoms. Wavo’s the only one that seems to grasp that we’re documenting *stories*, not just data. Is it perfect? No. But it’s the first tool that didn’t make me want to yeet my laptop into a lake after a 12-patient day.

So, I have some thoughts after a month of this experiment. Here’s my take:

AI scribes have the potential to revolutionize mental health documentation, offering psychiatrists a lifeline in the battle against burnout and administrative overload. For example:

* Save time by automating repetitive charting tasks
* Capture nuances like tone, pauses, and affect shifts—critical in psychiatry—that traditional templates might miss.
* Reduce errors with real-time transcription, minimizing the risk of misremembered details.
* Track trends through dashboards that visualize symptom progression, medication adherence, or mood patterns over time.

But proceed with caution:

* Accuracy isn’t guaranteed. Even the best AI can misinterpret speech (e.g., confusing “mania” with “manners”) or hallucinate clinical details.
* Over-reliance dangers. AI might streamline notes but could erode clinical reasoning if providers stop critically engaging with the content.
* One-size-fits-none. Many tools prioritize primary care workflows, struggling with psychiatry-specific needs like therapy progress notes or complex MSEs.

Key considerations:

* Augment, don’t replace. Use AI as a collaborator, not a substitute for clinical judgment. Always review and edit outputs.
* Test context awareness. Can the tool distinguish between a patient’s literal statement (“I want to disappear”) and dark humor?
* Prioritize adaptability. Look for scribes that learn your documentation style and allow custom templates for psychotherapy, risk assessments, or forensic notes.

That if he wants he could call me or meet for coffee.

 My thought process was, he’ll tell me in a final way that he doesn’t want to talk to me anymore and will never get back together with me, which I think would’ve been helpful. 

 He ended up sending me a distant and long message ending with “If you really feel that a chat would be helpful, let’s opt for that coffee idea”

 This was the option I was least ready for him to take, and I’m not sure what I want from that meeting but it’s making me extremely anxious. 

 I’m thinking depending on how brave I am and how I feel, I’ll give him a letter at the end telling him how he hurt me and howI feel about it, in case I can’t say it out loud. At the same time, I’m bad with conflict and honestly don’t want to lose all contact, although this distant contact is probably hurting me more than it’s helping.

I (20F) and my roommate (22F) have been living in our apartment for over 5 months. We used to live in another apartment but recently switched because the rent was just getting too much for us to pay,we never had problems with our old neighbors so we werent used to neighbors telling us off whenever we made too much noise.

 
A couple of months ago we were talking in our room and we heard a bang on the wall,it was from our neighbors telling us to stfu,do we stopped talking and went to bed.The following nights whenever we wanted to talk we would go into the living room se we dont disturb our neighbors.A couple of days after they banged on the wall,we were leaving to go get coffee and when we opened the door we noticed there was a letter stuck on our door.It said “Dear neighbors,could you please be more quiet after 11pm since we have to get up early for work and we try to be as quiet as possible for you as well since our bedrooms are connected” and we respect that and apologized that we were being inconsiderate.

Fast forward 2 months,last night i was laying in bed and my roommate was sleeping on the couch on the living room since she got sick and didnt want for me to catch her cold.I was laying in bed silently just scrolling through Tiktok (wearing headphones)i heard three bangs on the wall,it was the neighbors telling us to stfu again but i got confused since no one was making noise but i didnt say anything.

This morning at around 7:30 am i was asleep and i kept hearing birds right outside my window but drifted back to sleep three  minutes later i heard the loudest bangs ever and honestly i was fucking terrified i thought someone was coming to murder us and i know it sounds stupid but i was half asleep.So i decided to do the same thing that they did to us and write a letter to them as well.I wrote “Dear neighbors,i understand that from our previous encounters that the noise that was coming from our side this morning may have sounded like we were doing something but we just wanted to inform you that we dont have control of birds and dont ask them to bother you on purpose please refrain from making noise that early in the morning since you scared us half to death this morning,respectfully the neighbors next to you”

You're the reason I changed, I grew up and learnt that I am able to love. You were my whole world. My biggest moments were next to you. The Sunday mornings we were waking up together, the coffees we had in the woods, our life in our batmobil...The days with you are the only days that felt complete. I've known how much I would love you, right from the first moment and now that the years go by, I know I was right. I love you and I will continue loving you no matter what. I only have to grieve, again, for the life I'm missing. Maybe in another life.

i work in shifts at a coffee shop, not something i want to do for life but i’m also yet to do my degree and start the career path i really want. at the same time, i don’t know what i want to do. i have nothing i’m really passionate about. recently, i’ve had some trouble with a co-worker as i had gotten quite sick with a uti and she had to cover for me while i took a week of emergency sick leave. she was extremely unhappy about this, i said i would help her if she needed. then she started college this month and she needed me to cover for her but i had a meeting planned (for the wedding planning) and i simply couldn’t do it. i had covered for her a day prior to this so she could go to a concert lol

now she holds quite a bit of animosity and resentment against me. we have tried to solve it 3 times with no avail. i’ve also reached out to my boss to see if he could help. nothing works and she says she needs her time.

1ig71j0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ig71j0/what_happened_to_my_best_friend_hes_becoming/,What happened to my best friend? He's becoming insufferable and I don't know how to handle it,"We have been best friends for approaching 25 years.  He's a year older than me, he's 41.  He's always been a little opinionated and could be a little preachy, but nothing major.  He was very much a normal guy that liked a drink, having fun etc.  We have always shared every similar interests and tastes in TV shows etc.  

Over the past 3 years though I have noticed him change quite a bit.  Increasingly more opinionated, hypocritical, bitter and very much his way or the highway.  A few years ago he gave up alcohol, which is very positive as he was going out and drinking too much.  However instead of that being a personal choice for him, he instantly began judging me and everyone else for drinking alcohol.  For reference I am a very little drinker, like 3 beers once a month.  He suddenly got into ""self help"" books and videos and takes them as absolute gospel to the point he aggressively preaches the contents and judges you if you aren't following whatever pseudoscience notice is being spouted.  An example would be I'll message him saying I had a bad day at work today and he'll snap back ""I told you that you need to listen to x, you have 0 idea of your life direction that's why today happened to you.  Look at me since I started the learning how clear everything is to me"".  I'm particularly rattled today after a message from him.  Yesterday I sent him a clip of an old TV show we used to watch, which he ignored, then today he messaged a little dig how me watching clips of old TV shows is a signal of how bad my mental health is and he hopes that turns around for me soon.  Anything I do is judged.  When I lift weights, that's the wrong type of exercise.  I talk to a girl, that's the wrong type of girl.  Any decision I make is the wrong one.

He's become very hypocritical.  Even about silly things.  For instance his diet is terrible, lots of processed foods.  Mine is very healthy, but at the weekend I have some desserts, he on the other hand has given up sugar so judges me massively for this.  If I catch a cold I get ""that's your body struggling to deal with the sugar.  You need to give up sugar like me, that's the next step of growth and development for you"".  Whenever he wants though he can do whatever he previously said was wrong.

He absolutely hates it when I get attention from girls when he doesn't.  As in he gets angry and instantly wants us to leave the venue and will say things like ""she was looking at me when we first came in but I gave her nothing.  Why are you lowering yourself to girls like that?"".  Any success I get say a promotion at work he will have a dig at ""I think you need to consider what your direction is.  If you are happy to settle for that path that's fine but you need to admit that it's comfort you want and not growth"".  He lives back at home with his parents, doesn't drive, has a part time job with no prospects.  But insists he's totally in control, is ""building"" and that everyone with a house and good jobs etc are sheep.  He's growing increasingly mean towards his elderly parents and actually seems to be quite paranoid, for example he will call or message me incredibly angry saying that his mother has just told him that his brother has been offered a new job and that to him that's her having a dig at him and insulting him. 

There's other odd/changed behaviour.  He wears a suit, shirt and die as is normal every day dress now.  As in dresses like that to go food shopping.  His belief being it's part of being a ""high value person"".  He also keeps visiting very high end restaurants and luxury roof top bars etc but just ordering a black coffee and a tap water.  I cringe at this because the staff are always really awkward when that's his order and I try to tell him they really don't want to give tables up for orders like that but he snaps back that they want high value looking customers like him because it adds value to the place.  

I'm at a point now where I am big time walking on egg shells constantly.  His mood is increasingly more erratic too.  Sometimes really easy going like the old him and then the next day and absolute terror.  

What do you think happened to him for this change?  A mid life crisis?  What do you think I should do going forward?

TLDR:
Best friend changed over the past few year.
Now very judgemental and preachy. 
Other bad qualities like jealousy, put downs, constantly finding fault in everything I and others do and himself becoming more and more hypocritical.
Now fanatically into self help stuff and obsessed with being a ""high value"" person.",0,1738528738.0,Advice,0,0.5,False

So now everyone has to suffer. What an immature, pathetic moron. (I think the poor sap isn't getting laid, and it's starting to get to him.)

I believe that sooner or later, when there is no produce on the shelves at their local grocery stores, even his most fanatical followers will finally get fed up with his crap and abandon him, vote out all of his Republican lackeys, and demand his resignation. I hope they will wake up soon and smell the coffee.

1ig6vt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReddXReads/comments/1ig6vt3/nasty_norman_stalked_me_chapter_5_mad_bladder/,Nasty Norman Stalked Me!!!!  (Chapter 5: Mad Bladder),"**The Nasty Norman Invasion** 

As I emerged from the staircase and headed down the walkway leading to my apartment, my blood ran cold when I saw a thin, male-shaped figure sitting in front of my door.  I didn’t have my “key claw” at the ready since my apartment complex was in a safe part of town.  But having seen the eerie figure, I began to retreat to the stairwell to ready the pepper spray.  

And then, the thin, male-shaped figure shakily rose from a plastic chair that he seemed to have taken from the common patio on the second floor.  A thick pair of glasses glistened.  The figure waved.  “Valerie!  Uh.  Hi.  It’s me, Norm!  I thought we could watch Caligula!”  He waved a VHS tape at me.  

My fright quickly morphed into fury and adrenaline fueled my stomps as I moved towards my door to confront the codger.  “What the hell are you doing at my apartment???  How the hell do you know where I live???  How long have you been sitting here???”

Norman shuffled towards me.  “They really need to put in an elevator here.  It was exceptionally difficult to climb your stairs with this boot.  And I’ve been... Uh.  Needing to use your... ahem... facilities for a while now.”

In the sternest tone I could muster, I said, “Why are you HERE, Norman?”

Norman was cupping his crotch and doing the Pee-Pee Dance.  “You said you had never seen Caligula.  I’m here to share my knowledge of classic cinema.  But I.  Uh.  I really need to micturate”

So did I.  And as I unlocked my door, Norman invaded my personal space and shoved past me... even though I hadn’t invited him in.  In an uncharacteristically whiny voice, he begged me to tell him where the bathroom was in my studio apartment.  I pointed to the door across from my bed, and the nerdy mess of a man hobbled into my bathroom.  

Crap.  Had I left a box of tampons on the back of the toilet?  Was there a pile of clothes in the corner?  Oh no...  I refused to admit to Norman that we had ANYTHING in common, but I also read in the bathroom.  That was gonna be a whole-ass conversation, wasn’t it?  Ugh.  And I still needed to pee, too.  

What was TAKING so long?  I hate it when people try to talk to me while I’m in the bathroom (doesn’t matter what number I’m doing), so I bit my tongue and gave Norman his space.  But the flush told me that he was finished... *micturating* and was now snooping.  Fuck that guy.  I shooed the empathy away and called out to him.  

“NORMAN.  I have to pee.  Can you hurry up?”

He turned on the faucet and neglected to respond.  After what seemed like an eternity, he emerged, awkwardly boasting about how he always washed his hands for a full minute and a half and that he sang “Tiny Bubbles” by Don Ho while he lathered.  He tried to launch into a commentary on the scent of my cotton candy hand soap, but I told him to grab himself a drink from my fridge so that I could distract him from his mind-numbing prattling long enough to relieve myself.

When I was finally behind a closed door, I found that I seemed to have a case of “mad bladder.”  That’s right.  I was too pissed to piss.  As I sat there trying to answer nature’s call, I surveyed the room.  Damn.  There WAS a pile of clothes on the floor.  The tampon box was in a drawer, though.  Good.  I didn’t want Norman asking more intrusive questions about my period.  But the book that I’d been reading earlier was not in its usual place on the countertop.  And the book was... [Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0019FAIZC/?bestFormat=true&k=bonk%20the%20curious%20coupling%20of%20science%20and%20sex&ref_=nb_sb_ss_w_scx-ent-pd-bk-d_de_k0_1_8&crid=IHW1OBK70MNK&sprefix=bonk%20the) by Mary Roach.  (It's a great book, so why not use ReddX's Amazon affiliate link and grab yourself a copy!?)  I was reading it for one of my classes, but I seriously doubted Norman was gonna believe that.  Okay, at least my body was finally relaxing enough to allow me to take a leak.

After I washed my hands for a normal amount of time, I rummaged through the pile of clothes on the floor.  Did you guess it?  I bet you already guessed it.  My underwear wasn’t there.  Shirt?  Check.  Jeans?  Check. Bra?  Check.  Norman had taken my fucking underwear.  Seriously!  What was broken in his nasty noggin???

I flung the door open to see that Norman had helped himself to a glass of wine and was reading the back cover of Bonk on my couch.  I cleared my throat and adopted the same tone I used to use when I taught ballet to little children.  “NorrrrrrMAN?  Did you take something from my bathroom?”

Norman proudly held up my copy of Bonk.  “Indeed!  I must say.  Um.  Not exactly how I would choose to pass my, uh, privy time. But I’m pleased to see that you’re educating yourself on this subject.  I usually prefer to stick to history and philosophy as conversation topics, but... Uhhhhh.  This topic will do nicely.  And it’s the perfect companion piece for this evening’s feature!” 

Then he looked me up and down and groaned the loudest boner groan I’d ever heard him emit.  Dammit!  My hair was in high pigtails, and I was wearing a Panic! At the Disco shirt and a pleated plaid skirt atop striped tights and combat boots.  I was kind of a scene kid back then, and I had fun with my outfits whenever I felt like it.  It wasn’t uncommon for me to dress this way (I *still* dress this way pretty often because I’ll always be stuck in that era on some level).  But I also had my share of lazy days when I just wore jeans and a t-shirt with my hair in a messy bun.  That was how I’d been dressed the day he stalked me at school.  WHY couldn’t I have been sartorially lazy on THIS day??? 

Nasty Norman awkwardly crossed his legs.  “You seem to have dressed for some... Um.  Imaginative roleplay, Valerie.  (boner groan #2). I propose we canoodle on the couch as we watch Caligula.  I would then like you to misbehave.  We can have some, uhhh... (boner groan #3) FUN.  And then we can behave like sensible adults and enjoy a deep discussion of the book you have chosen.”  

I put my hands on my hips.  “That’s assigned reading for one of my CLASSES.  My interest in the subject matter is purely academic.  I’m sure a man of your intellect can respect that.”  His expression was an odd mixture of disappointed and prideful.  I completely ignored his repulsive desire for roleplay, even though it would have been a smart move to claim that I was dressed up because I had plans and needed to LEAVE.  Immediately.  To meet my gigantic beefcake of a boyfriend.  Ah, hindsight...  “Coulda shoulda wouldas” notwithstanding, it was time to call out that creepazoid for his pervy stealing.

“NorrrrrrrMAN?  Did you take an article of my clothing?”

Norman farted.   He always farted when he was nervous.  And if that question had made him nervous, that meant he was guilty.  But I didn’t even bother to overtly accuse him.  I just held out my hand and said as firmly and calmly as I could.  “Give.  It.  Back.  NOW.”

An even bigger and louder fart rumbled into my couch cushions.  Norman sputtered.  “Uh.  Pardon me.  That was involuntary.  You’re welcome to light a...  Um.  Light a nice, uh... Romantic?  Candle?  If you’re offended by... Uh.  I haven’t eaten any broccoli or fennel today, so.  Um.  It’s probably not too pungent.”  He farted again.  “Pardon me.”

I rolled my eyes and let the anger take over.  “I don’t care about your fucking farting, Norman!  Give me back my underwear.  You’re acting like a jejune little FRAT BOY.  I thought you were more mature than this.”

A mini machine gun rat-tat-tatted in his pants as he tried to stand on his busted leg.  “I didn’t take your bloomers.  I swear!”

Right about then, I wanted to pull a gun on him, point it directly at his crotch and order him to turn his pockets inside out.  Alas, I didn’t own a gun.  Norman’s continued flatulence told me that he was nervous as hell, and I had the upper hand, even without a weapon.  But to my surprise, Norman awkwardly rose and turned his pockets inside out on his own.  He even removed his wallet from his back pocket and turned those inside out.  Aside from a few butterscotch candy wrappers, his pockets were empty.  But as I looked back and forth between his inside out pockets, I noticed a bit of lacey, neon coral fabric peeking out from the front of his greige trousers.  He’d shoved my underwear into his own tightie whities.  Aw, HAY-ULL NO.    

 “What’s in your PANTS, Norman?”

I expected him to fart thunderously in response to my accusation.  I expected him to turn beet red.  I half expected him to start crying like a busted little bitch.  Instead, he groaned, grabbed my hand, and whispered, “I thought you’d never ask...”  And then, the nasty nerd pulled me towards him and came at me with a wide-open mouth.  I twisted my face away, giving him nothing but a mouthful of purple pigtail.  Okay, I was out of the danger zone.  For now.  Maybe.

Nope.  Norman sputtered a bit, stumbled a bit, but soon regained his balance enough to hobble towards me with his arms outstretched and his mouth once again wide open.  You know how toddlers reach out and splat their mouths onto your cheek when they haven’t learned how to pucker their lips and give kisses yet?  It’s sweet when it’s your baby nephew or your friend’s kid.  It’s creepy AF when a grown man does it.  I scurried to the tiny little kitchenette and climbed on top of the countertop, possibly giving him and eyeful of upskirt.  But at that, point, I was more concerned with getting out of his reach than I was with modesty.  I was so fucking done with this night.  “NORMAN!”  I shouted.  “This is ten thousand kinds of inappropriate.  Get away from me.  Close your mouth.  Hand over the underwear. I didn’t invite you over.  I don’t want to watch Caligula with you.  I don’t even own a VCR!  GO.  HOME.  Do you understand me?”

Norman didn’t seem to acknowledge anything I’d said and began rambling at me.  “I’m impressed that one so young as yourself is able to live all alone.”

“I’m older than I look,” I retorted.  “And my BROTHER lives a few doors down, so I’m not all that alone.  He’s playing rugby right now, but he’ll probably stop by when the game’s over.”  My brother *didn’t* live in my complex and he hadn’t played rugby since he was in Junior Rugby League, but I wanted Norman to fear the wrath of a strapping young man.  

This time, Norman farted.  Where that brief surge of confidence came from, I’ll never know.  I’ll never care.  But now that he was breaking wind again, I felt a little calmer knowing that I’d managed to rattle him.  But rattled as he was, he didn’t leave.  He plopped his ass back down on my couch and slugged back the entire glass of wine.  The one-man freak show hiccupped a little and said with an exaggerated slur, “I’m a tad tipsy.  Can’t drive.  Must stay.” 

My ass.  “Call an Uber.”  The wine he’d slugged back was Barefoot Pink Moscato.  Most of my friends called it “Kool-Aid Wine.”  It was nigh impossible to get drunk on it.

Norman shook his head.  “None of that newfangled nonsense for me.  Back in my day, the host never complained if a guest was too inebriated to get home safely.  It was a good night if you had to sleep on a friend’s sofa.”

I just glared at him.  Then Norman remembered that he was “drunk” and promptly slumped over.  This was starting to remind me of an upside down and backwards version of Drunk Dennis passed out on my couch, wearing my underwear.  But this was worse.  How the hell had this nasty old creep managed to be insufferable enough to make me all nostalgic for the darkest days of DENNIS???

I climbed down from the countertop and rifled through my purse.  “Fine.  You can use my Uber account.”

Norman swayed to and fro.  “No.  I’ll just sleep here.  I’ll be no bother.”

“You’re already a bother,” I snapped.  “What’s your address?”

Norman chuckled like the lamest Disney villain in history.  “I’ll never tell.”

But he’d taken his wallet out of his back pocket and placed it on the coffee table when he’d turned his pockets inside out.  Between his drunken geezer act and his legitimately gimpy leg, Norman wasn’t quick enough to beat me to it.  I flipped it open and took out his driver’s license.  It was expired.  And Norman was... 41.  Not nearly old enough to make him an OG hippie.  I locked myself in the bathroom and ordered his flat ass an Uber.  I also changed back into the jeans and t-shirt that were on my bathroom floor.

Norman loudly pleaded, “Y-You can’t use the address on my ID!  It isn’t... Uh.  Up to date!  They’ll take me to my parents’ house if you entered that address.  And we d-don’t get along!!!”

I’d already set up the ride.  I emerged from the bathroom and tried, once again, to get tough with the nut case on my couch.  “LOOK.  You can either tell the driver your address when they get here, or I can call the COPS and THEY can haul your ass home.  Or I suppose they could haul your ass to jail seeing as you’re trespassing at this point.  And I KNOW you already had a brush with the law because of what you did to Dionne.  What’ll it be?”

This time, Norman went red in the face.  “I thought you were a nice one!” he fulminated.  “All I wanted to do was enjoy a quiet evening and a fine film.  I don’t see what I’ve done to offend you, Valerie.  And what happened to that fetching schoolgirl attire?  You are BULLYING me!”

I guffawed.  I wasn’t sure if he was really THAT clueless or if this was just a ploy to get me to engage in conversation.  And the thought of ME being able to successfully bully ANYONE was laughable.  My phone triumphantly vibrated to let me know that Norman’s Uber was five minutes away (which meant it was more like 10 or 15 minutes away). 

I handed him his wallet.  “Get up.  Your ride’s almost here.”

Norman gestured towards the gargantuan boot on his leg.  “I’ll need help on the stairs.”  

GAH!  I couldn’t deny that it was probably unsafe for Norman to try to descend the stairs on his own.  Then again, I hadn’t invited his dumb ass over.  And I did NOT want him touching me.  I also didn’t want him taking a spill, breaking another bone, and finding a way to blame me.  

I sighed.  “Fine.  I’ll walk with you.  But so help me, if you show up here uninvited again, I’m calling the police.  This is not socially acceptable behavior.  Do you understand that?”

Norman had a bewildered look on his face.  “N-No.  Back in my day, we all dropped in on one another whenever...”

I cut him off.  “Well, we’re not living back in YOUR DAY.  And I don’t believe for a *second* that people didn’t have boundaries back then.”  I held the door wide open as Norman dejectedly shoved the VHS tape of Caligula back into his old-fashioned book satchel and limped on out.  As he finally exited my little residence, he pitifully muttered, “Why are females always so unkind to me?”

I was at my wit’s end.  “Get over yourself.  You’re *extremely* intrusive.  You refuse to back off even when you’ve been told NO a hundred times.  And I know it’s not just me.  You pulled this same crap with Dionne, and she’s a total sweetheart.  You make women feel UNSAFE.  It’s hard to be kind when you feel unsafe.  Can you understand that?”

“NO,” he said obstinately.  “And that bitch got me ARRESTED.  For NO REASON!  And then her hoodlum boyfriend threatened my LIFE!”

I rolled my eyes.  “No, he didn’t.  He did what any man would do in that situation.”  

“You weren’t there!” Norman cried.

“Dionne told me all about it.  You think we don’t talk???”

Norman farted again.  “I.  Um.  I apologize if it seems to you that I’m two-timing.  Uh.  I did not realize the two of you had remained in contact.  But you must understand...”

I cut him off.  “You’re not dating EITHER of us, so I’d hardly call it two-timing.”

Norman sighed with relief and launched into some mind-numbing nonsense about how flattered he was to be the subject of “girl talk.”  As we neared the stairs, Norman grabbed my hand and tried to lace his fingers through mine.  I moved to pull my hand away, but his grip was surprisingly tight.  Norman emitted a delighted little groan.  “This is so nice,” he mused.

Okay, did I feel sorry for Norman because he was clearly yearning for a human connection?  On some level, sure.  But you can’t barge into someone’s private residence and force a connection that isn’t emerging naturally.  That’s... kind of terrifying.  Once again, I feel the need to swear that I wasn’t usually a bitch.  If anything, I was usually overly tolerant of bizarre behavior.  But Norman had done nothing but cross line after line after line.  

I finally smacked his hand to make him loosen his grip.  He whimpered.  Ignoring his wounded puppy act, I told him, “It’ll probably be easier if I walk in front of you and you just put a hand on my shoulder for balance.” I picked up my pace so that I was standing in front of him.

Norman chuckled.  “Are you asking me for a massage, my dear?”

Ugh.  “NO.  I’m a human cane at this point.  This isn’t a romantic stroll through the park.”

Norman squeezed my shoulder.  “A stroll through the park would be most lovely, my dear.”

“Stop talking.”

By some minor miracle, I’d managed to help him waddle down the stairs without either of us getting injured.  After we reached the ground floor, he held his arms out as though he were expecting a hug and limped towards me a little with a wide-open mouth.  This time he was wiggling his tongue.  

Sternly, I told him, “NO, dude.  Read the room.”

Norman sputtered.  “B-but.  A room is no book.  And we’re outside.”

For fuck’s sake.  As I darted back into the stairwell, I shouted.  “GO HOME.  Don’t come back!”

“B-but how am I supposed to retrieve Old Reliable?”

I didn’t answer.  He was the Uber driver’s problem now.  “Off you fuck,” I muttered.  I was exhausted.  I don’t think I’ve ever yearned for solitude as much as I was yearning for it in that moment.  Norman was an energy vampire.  The whole evening had felt like babysitting some creature that was part toddler, part untrained puppy, part horned up prepubescent boy who’d never actually talked to a girl before, and part demented old man who wanted to tell you all about how things were back in HIS DAY.  And, dammit!  The fart-knocking perv still had my underwear.

1ig6v6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverhousing/comments/1ig6v6v/open_houses_adding_significant_stress_on_my_life/,Open houses adding significant stress on my life. What can I do?,"Our landlord is trying to sell the apartment we're living in and we've had showings nearly every weekend for 2 months for a total of about 10 open houses at this point. 

They do the showings every Saturday and Sunday so our whole weekends are disrupted and they won't stop asking us to vacate the apartment during these 2 hour windows. I know I don't legally have to leave and I've told them before that we may be home and will do our best to be undisruptive. Usually only 1 of us is home anyway and is just on our laptops doing homework with earbuds in. The realtors are also quite rude (in a professional manner,  I suppose) to us when they show up and realize that we will be there. 

Last weekend the guy even asked my roommate if she could go work at a cafe instead of in the apartment. Like, are you offering to buy her a coffee then?! Leaving the house costs money. I recieved a text from them this morning at 7am asking us to make arrangements to leave during the open house today. It's the middle of winter and there was a literal snow storm last night! Why do these people have no sympathy?

They send multiple texts and emails a week about showings and reminding us to clean up (get bent) and be vacant from the unit. We've been asked to provide our keys to the realtors since our landlord couldn't and I was bugged for several weeks until I, myself,  went to get another key cut for them. One day my roommate was showering during the open house and I recieved MULTIPLE texts and calls from both realtors and landlords while I was at work because they were annoyed. It's really feeling like spam/harassment at this point and I get no compensation for this.

This adds so much stress to my life and I'm not sure if I should contact the RTB about this and if I have a case at all. Showings every single weekend for months on end seems incredibly disruptive. Not to mention that most of these people are just wandering in off the street and are here to just snoop around. What can we do?

He’s always really nice and I genuinely enjoy our conversations together. He even brings my boss and I baked goods sometimes. Today, we were having a conversation while I was checking him out at the register, and he asked me if I’d like to get coffee with him sometime. He sounded very nervous and kind of stuttered a little bit. He is twice my age, so in my head I thought I had to say no. I responded and told him I’m pretty busy with school right now, but thanked him for asking. We finish the transaction and honestly I can’t remember if he said something after that or not, I was pretty shocked that he asked me out. 

Truthfully, a part of me was flattered that he had asked me that, and I thought I would have enjoyed a coffee date with him. Is it weird of me to have wanted to say yes, given that he’s twice my age? He’s a nice guy and really fun to talk to. I guess I’m having a moral dilemma. Am I weird for wanting to say yes? When I told my friends what happened, they acted disgusted, like he was a creep.

Also, I can’t tell if maybe he just thought I was older than I am? I get told by a lot of people that I look and act “mature” for my age. Additionally, my job is considered a career for most people who have it, not a common job a full-time college student would have (another reason why he might have thought I’m older than I actually am). When I told him I was busy with school, his eyes kind of widened, as if in shock.

This one took a LOT longer to make than I anticipated! I wanted to get this done by Friday evening, and instead I was up until almost 5am working on it both Friday night and Saturday, haha. At first I wanted to just buff a few of the weaker class passives, then I started getting some ideas, started discussing them with some people, one thing led to another and I was brewing a pot of coffee. What all has changed? Lots of buffs to weaker passives, meaning even better build variety! Let's go through the changes then.

CREATURES  
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frozen and Stunned have been added to the list of ""Lockdown"" status effects.

Underdark races immunity to blind has been reworked to immunity to magical darkness - now firing into/from a darkness cloud works as intended and overall feels way, way smoother.

Half-Orc's now have +4 Initiative and Advantage on STR based Saving Throws, to keep them consistent with the other Half-X races.

Phase Spiders within the well in the Goblin village now benefit from the effects of Featherfall.

  
  
GEAR  
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overwhelm now triggers on both hits and misses, allowing Two-Handed weapons to better compete with Dual Wieldings damage output.

Overwhelm has been removed from Flail type weapons, and replaced with Weakening Strike.

Shields have had a MUCH more extensive rework to also allow them to compete with Dual Wielding and Two-Handed. This needed to be a bit more aggressive of a rework, as typically high damage strategies are far better than defensive ones. To compensate for the loss of damage, shields now provide very noticeable improvements to your ability to tank. First of all, Shields no longer provide passive Armour Class. Instead, all shields now come with two new reactions. One is called ""Raise Shield"", which reduces your opponents Attack Roll by a value equal to your Proficiency Bonus for free when attacked. This essentially functions EXACTLY as if a shield had granted you passive AC. However, now shields will improve as you level, just like your choice of weapon. Along with that, now that your AC is ""lower"", equipping a shield will no longer make AI less likely to attack you. On the contrary, they'll be MORE likely to attack you, allowing you to fulfill the role of a defensive tank more easily. The second reaction you gain with shields is Shield Bash - when an enemy misses you in melee range, you can retaliate to deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage and potentially knock your target Prone. This means that you can bait enemies in with your ""lower"" AC, then bash them when you force them to miss! Furthermore, with a shield equipped, all damage taken by weapons is reduced by your Proficiency Bonus. Another change worth noting that when you make an Attack Roll with a Ranged weapon, all benefits from your shield are disabled until the beginning of your next turn. No more equipping a shield on your Ranger just to passively benefit from it - if you want it, it needs to be equipped and be used.

Spellmight Gloves now apply their damage bonus to the first attack roll you make per turn, meaning they will no longer grant higher than intended bonuses to spells like Scorching Ray.

  
ILLITHID POWERS  
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Various text fixes and improvements for descriptions.  


SPELLS  
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Dominate Creature now requires you to deal damage in order to break the effect.  
Dominated creatures also now make a save to shake the effects each turn.  
Gust Bellow has had it's range corrected.  
Mind Slither can no longer be cast without line of sight.  
The debuff from the Zaithisk is now removed upon dying or a Long Rest.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hope you all enjoy the changes! Please don't hesitate to report anything you find that feels bugged, imbalanced, if anything doesn't look or feel ""professional"", etc. Have fun!",7,1738527823.0,BG3Homebrew,7,1.0,False

You’re not alone. That instant dopamine hit from notifications and social media tricks your brain into thinking it’s rewarding—but in reality, it’s just setting you up for distraction and low motivation throughout the day.

Now, imagine swapping that with a quick memory challenge. Engaging your brain first thing in the morning with something active (instead of passive scrolling) releases dopamine in a way that actually **boosts** motivation and focus. It’s the difference between feeling sharp vs. sluggish before your first coffee. At the same time it helps you transition from the state of feeling disoriented to being alert.

Try it tomorrow: Instead of reaching for your phone, test yourself—recall yesterday’s to-do list, list five capitals, or replay a conversation in your head. Small mental wins early on can set the tone for a productive day.

1ig6mgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ig6mgw/my_m28_girlfriend_f31_lashed_out_after_i_told_her/,My (M28) girlfriend (F31) lashed out after I told her I would like to be involved in making plans that involve me and other people. I feel like she is emotionally abusive.,"Hello and thank you, I find myself in a dark moment in this relationship. I am starting to think she is abusive emotionally. I start to feel like I walk around eggshells. Anyway:

My girlfriend and I have a relationship of ups and downs since April. We met in the city we lived and then she went away (5hr train) for work. So we became sorta long distance.

That was fine, because I wanted to make it work. I was unemployed at the time so I had more possibilities and occasions to visit her than viceversa. I spent a lot of time travelling from the two cities, often in the very first morning. I always participated in the expenses and never lived as a leech in her new house. I did this always and only for love, the discomfort was pretty much non existent when I thought of her face, voice and smile.

But there always has been a problem. She never came in my city (and hers) only for me. It was always some occasions where she made some time for me, like sleeping one night then going to family, with friends, etc. I was never not okay with her doing her things, of course. I was not okay, though, with her never coming for me as the first reason, and in a long distance relationship I value that. The commitment I feel must be somewhat reciprocated.

So, fast forward, since some times we didn't had a coffee, a beer, a dinner out, a night out in our original city where we met and I live. She comes down for her sister's birthday and sleeps at my place. The day after she went to family, hangs out with a friend for dinner then sleeps with me. 

Now, for the remaining time our plans where: go out after lunch, have coffee we two, hang out, walk in the city, find a present for her sister. I was excited! How much I longed for something like this! 

Then, her friend of the night before calls.
She stand up from the kitchen and goes picking up the phone. I overhear that she tells her that yes, we are totally fine going for a coffee in the center with her and her mother. I was very bitter. So, she hangs the phone with our new plans ready and comes back to eat. I then tell her I didn't quite like to be left out of plans that involves me and other people when we had our day planned, our day in the city since...months?

She lashes out. She starts raising her voice, accusing me of being antisocial, controlling and a man that wants her secluded and isolated from her friends. She even made comments, almost screaming, about how her exes were involved with her friends and family (her exes she described like abusives), while I don't want it. I felt gutted and hurt and like crying. I try to calm the tones and to talk, to resolve this like a couple, not with throwing plates. She bolted out the door to go without me at the coffee, saying that she didn't want to see even my shadow. I am devasted.

The evening at the party she kisses me in the lips in front of everyone and everything seems like a dream. I can't believe she can switch this way. I feel almost revolted not by her but by me that stand those situations. She doesn't seem to want to apologize and I tried to talk about it the next day, because I am hurt, but she seems okay with what she did and somehow I was the one at fault for even thinking that she should have like asked me if I was okay with the imminent change of plans (I would have been totally ok, it was a damn coffee, BUT ASK ME!)

How do I move? I am devastated.

Anyway, she comes from an abusive household for her mother's abusive and manipulative behaviors.

TL.DR: My girlfriend lashed out after I told her she could be making plans that involves me and other people asking me before, when we had already planned to be together me and her  alone after months.",1,1738527715.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False
1ig6meh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AoSLore/comments/1ig6meh/what_would_soda_be_like_in_the_mortal_realms/,What would Soda be like in the Mortal Realms?,"One of my favorite aspects about Age of Sigmar is the creators' willingness to toss the genre conventions of High Fantasy to the winds. 

The Lumineth and Gargants, the resident High Elves and Giants, are among the youngest sapient species in the Mortal Realms not the oldest. 

The alliance of Humans, Dwarves, and Elves takes the form of dozens or hundreds of cities where all three species live and thrive together, rather than apart, led by multi-species councils. 

Another hallmark of High Fantasy is people love alcohol. As are coffee and tea. Interestingly the forms of all three are dometimes types reliant on tech often not available in many settings. But that's neither here nor there as we write what we know and often we don't know the full processes that lead to the creation of this or that, and more oft than not. It's a story, lore is fun but story comes first. 

Then there is soda, cola, pop, the soft drink. Often ignored by settings even ones with magitek or regular engineering. So the long preamble aside. 

Both Kharadron and the Cities of Sigmar have the technology and industries that could become soda industries as well as large urban populations to support it. 

So my question to you dear Realmwalkers. Is what do you think soda in the Mortal Realms would be like? What brews and flavors would Hammerhal Aqsha and Ghyra prefer? Traditionalist Barak-Thryng? Cosmopolitan Brightspear? Stoic Vindicarum? Nature-attuned Living City? Or any others? ",9,1738527712.0,AoSLore,5,0.8,False

I've had had a few good matches and my problem is timeline. We message, go on a date, it goes well, and we continue to message. Great conversations both ways. They always confirm they want kids. I'm ok with that. 

The past three were 34F, 37F, and 37F.  I would think there would be a higher tempo of dates. 

Messaging tempo seems fine but less than two in person a month? I get that we're two busy, working adults. Then, when I explain my view, it usually is the end of the match.  ""I'm sorry, it's been a busy month.""

--------------

I'm not sure if edits or updates are allowed. 

To clarify:

When I say I'm ""Open to kids""

- If I meet someone amazing and they say they 100% do not want to have kids, then I'm fully on board. That will give us the chance to spend more time together later on in life. 

Either way, I would like to be able to get to know someone not just through messaging. Even if it's a brief coffee date during lunch. ",1,1738527709.0,Bumble,22,0.53,False

1ig6lt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1ig6lt2/i_miss_the_trolls_of_the_early_internet_days/,I miss the trolls of the early internet days.,"Seriously, trolling quality has gone rapidly downhill. I grew up in the 90s/2000s. Back when you had to listen to the WEEE-oooo-eee-oooooo that rolled into the Bwee-oww-bwee-bwee-bweep that became Krrrkkk-chk-chk, and finally you connected with Bwoop-bwoop-bweeeewww, ""You've got mail."" And you always thought, 'fuck finally!'



And you were lucky if it worked on the first try or your mom and dad didn't suddenly pick up the phone, kicking you off before your time was up, and then you had to start the process all over again! You felt excited with the anticipation of going online into those magical Yahoo, AOL, etc., chatroom spaces where everyone was magically a girl unless you were a girl, and then they were all your age! A/S/L? You'd say and the chaos began! Or bombarding Ask Jeeves with all your random questions, ""Hey, Jeeves...?"" You'd type, patiently waiting five minutes for it to load the answers to your question. Or you'd get onto Hot or Not and upload a very grainy picture of yourself, fingers crossed that you'd be rated at least average, as you waited breathlessly for replies.



And the trolls? The trolls were top-tier artists! They didn't engage in strawman arguments, or ""I know you are but what am I?"" preschooler tactics. No, they were artistry. They put effort into their nonsense. You’d get elaborate pranks, absurd yet hilarious arguments, and actual wit. Some of them were straight-up internet philosophers in disguise. Even when they were annoying, at least they were entertaining. Now? It’s just the same tired, low-effort, bad-faith garbage over and over. People think copy-pasting a snarky tweet or calling someone a bootlicker or ""libtard snowflake"" is some kind of intellectual checkmate. There’s no creativity, no humor—just stale, predictable nonsense designed to farm engagement.



Hacker trolls were even better! They had flair and style in their insanity. Back in the day, hacker trolls weren’t just about chaos—they were artists. They had a code of honor: mess with people, but don’t actually ruin lives (well, mostly). They weren’t just dropping insults in comment sections; they were engineering pranks with skill, precision, and a little bit of poetic flair. The printer hackers? Hilarious. One of the greatest hacker troll pranks involved remote printer hijacking. Some genius trolls discovered that certain networked printers had open ports, meaning anyone could send print jobs to them. So what did they do? They sent thousands of pages of ASCII art—sprawling, ridiculous text-based images of cows, trolls, or just ""WHY ARE YOU PRINTING THIS?!"" in massive block letters. Office workers would arrive in the morning to find entire reams of paper wasted on ASCII dinosaurs. Beautiful.



The ‘Internet Explorer is Illegal’ Popup. This was peak early 2000s trolling. Some clever hacker trolls figured out how to replace homepage settings in Internet Explorer with a fake FBI warning that said something like INTERNET EXPLORER USAGE IS A FEDERAL OFFENSE!!! With massive X's and blazing red letters. Your IP has been logged and reported to the authorities. Please call (555)-YOU-GOT-TROLLED to appeal your case. People panicked—especially clueless adults who thought they were about to be arrested for using a default browser. Some even called fake hotlines, only to get Rickrolled or hear a robotic voice repeating “You done goofed.”



The GTA Hot Coffee Mod Incident, genius. One of the most legendary hacker troll moments was when some anonymous modders unlocked a secret, unfinished mini-game in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas that was never meant to be seen. It was an X-rated ""dating"" activity, and once it was exposed, it caused a massive moral panic. Seriously, that one was good. The game was re-rated from M (Mature) to AO (Adults Only), got pulled from shelves, and Rockstar had to issue a massive patch. The best part? The hackers didn’t even add anything new—Rockstar had hidden the content in the game files, and the trolls just flipped the switch. Pure chaos.



Now it's all gone downhill; the internet used to be a lively place you couldn't wait to get on and see the insanity some genius had enacted. Now it's ugh, more doom scrolling, more people didn't actually read what was said. Mindless circular logic debates and strawman logical fallacy after logical fallacy. I miss the old internet trolls.

1ig6kxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroCovidCommunity/comments/1ig6kxo/feel_like_life_is_passing_me_by/,Feel like life is passing me by,"My mother was a narcissist and she took her hatred out on me. My mother had such control over my teenage years.
Because of that, I had anxiety in my 20s and I cared what others thought.
By the time my 30s came around, I really didn't care what others thought, so I done my own thing and went on holidays by myself without a care in the world.

I thought because of this i thought, things would fall into place for me in my 30s. But my career wasn't going as planned and I was still single. I was happy being single though but everybody thinks, I should be with someone by now.

2020, comes around and I was 37 and we all know how that went with restrictions. Even though I knew from the start, this was something not to catch, I was still open to meeting someone and one day I did. We were both out cycling on our bikes, I stopped to take a break and he stopped as well and we got chatting. He seemed nice and we organised to meet up for a few days later. The day came and he showed up an hour late. I should have left after 10 minutes but I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. There was a cafe near by and we got a take away coffee. I was honest with him from the start and told him I was scared of getting covid. He wasn't respecting me at all and all he wanted was to lock lips which I wasn't allowing. He kept asking to go to a quieter place which wasn't happening either. I don't know what this man would have done if I turned against him, so I pretended I was still interested in him and I told him I had to go and I would see him again (this was a lie on my part). The next day, I received a message from him telling me to tell him my address and he told me to change my clothes and wear a dress. At this point I told him to f off. We knew each other for 3 days and he wanted to change what I wear!!!

So I left dating after that. Not long after that, I received my notice from my landlord and they wanted the house back that I was renting. At this time, I was house sharing and it was very stressful because of the whole covid situation. There's a housing crisis where I am and it's so difficult to find a place. So it took me 5 months to find a place. But I found a one bedroom apartment, and I'm so happy living by my myself (with my cat).

Living on my own and being on my own and I've never been happier. However, I do miss travelling and concerts. I just don't have the confidence to do anything risky even wearing a mask. I hardly leave the house anymore except for work. So I'm taking risks every day by going into work but not comfortable with anything else. Society depresses me and just how nobody cares. People have reverted back like it's 2019 and spreading colds and flu and I hate it. I hate how people think the vulnerable are those that are sick or old but not everyone who's catching covid repeatedly.

I hate how not only are we still in a pandemic, but H5N1 is very close to infecting us as well.

So I'm now in my early 40s and haven't done anything for the past 5 years. Hard to believe being 50 is just around the corner.",30,1738527614.0,ZeroCovidCommunity,2,0.95,False

I have the Oracle Jet touch and I LOVE IT! However I feel like there is just so much I don’t know.

2. What do the different grind settings do? Is there an optimal one? 

3. I’ve seen people in videos spray their beans…can someone explain this and is this something I should do? What is it?

4. For the life of me I can’t get my milk to froth well. I use a barista blend oat milk and with a handheld frother it works so well but I can’t get the machine to do it even tried diff temps etc. Anyone perfected this yet or have tips? 

5. I keep seeing people talk about puck screens. What is this and do I need this?

1ig6dbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ig6dbv/technivorm_moccamaster_79112_kbt_coffee_brewer/,Technivorm Moccamaster 79112 KBT coffee brewer review is this the best drip brewer?,"The Technivorm Moccamaster 79112 KBT coffee brewer caught my eye after reading countless reviews, and I decided it was time to give this machine a real try. I've been using it every morning for the past few weeks and let me tell you, this coffee maker has sparked some strong opinions in my household! It’s sleek, modern, and polished silver finish gives my kitchen a splash of elegance, but can it truly live up to the hype? Here’s my honest take, with both its highlights and flaws.

**Design & Build Quality**  
Straight out of the box, the Technivorm Moccamaster 79112 KBT impresses with its polished silver appearance and minimalist design. Handmade in the Netherlands, it screams premium craftsmanship. While the aluminum body looks sturdy, some of the plastic components like the water reservoir and the brew basket feel a little less luxurious than you’d expect at this price point. I can’t help but wonder how these lighter plastic parts will hold up over time with regular use. However, the stainless steel thermal carafe does feel like it could survive an apocalypse. It’s functional and keeps coffee warm for hours.

**Brewing Performance**  
This is where it gets interesting. The Moccamaster brews a full 40-ounce pot in about six minutes. The water heats up to the optimal brewing temperature (between 196°F and 205°F), which is key for extracting flavors. The manual-adjust drip-stop on the brew basket is a fun feature, allowing you to control how fast coffee flows into the carafe. I’ve tested different settings, and while the control is nice, patience is sometimes required. It’s not the quickest brewer, but it’s consistent, and the coffee comes out smooth and delicious.

**Coffee Flavor**  
The coffee brewed by the Technivorm Moccamaster is impressive. I mean, it’s the kind of coffee that makes you want to slow down your morning and savor every sip. The flavor is rich, smooth, and free from bitterness, almost like a barista made it. My sister, who’s a coffee snob, came over for brunch one weekend and was blown away. Even she admitted it rivaled her beloved pour-over setup. I used a medium roast bean with a medium grind, and it brought out subtle notes I never knew existed in my beans.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**  
Cleaning this coffee maker is fairly straightforward. Most parts are removable, and the manual even walks you through the process. However, I did find that the stainless steel carafe is a bit tricky to clean thoroughly due to its narrow opening. Pro tip: invest in a good bottle brush to make your life easier. Also, while the reusable filter is eco-friendly, it does mean you’ll need to clean it after every use, which can be tedious for some.

**Pros:**

* Produces smooth, flavorful coffee consistently.
* Sleek, polished design with a durable stainless steel carafe.
* Brews at the optimal temperature for coffee extraction.
* Manual-adjust drip-stop offers some control over brewing flow.
* Handmade in the Netherlands with a 5-year warranty.

**Cons:**

* Plastic components feel less durable compared to the rest of the build.
* Carafe can be tricky to clean due to its narrow opening.
* Not the fastest brewing experience.
* No programmable features for automatic brewing.
* Higher price point compared to many competitors.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
The Technivorm Moccamaster 79112 KBT stands tall against competitors like the Breville Precision Brewer and Bonavita Connoisseur. While the Breville offers customizable brewing modes and a programmable timer, it’s more complex to operate. The Moccamaster’s simplicity is its charm, though it lacks the flexibility of the Breville. Compared to the Bonavita Connoisseur, the Moccamaster outshines in design and build quality but falls short on affordability. The Bonavita is a solid option for those who want great coffee without breaking the bank.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
Let’s address the elephant in the room: the price. The Technivorm Moccamaster 79112 KBT is an investment, no doubt about it. While it delivers exceptional coffee and boasts a durable design, you’re paying a premium for its handmade craftsmanship and stellar reputation. Is it worth it? If you’re someone who values high-quality coffee and wants a machine that will last years, then yes, it’s worth considering. However, if you’re on a tight budget, there are other machines that can deliver solid results for less.

**Features That Stand Out**  
The Moccamaster’s thermal carafe is a game-changer for keeping coffee hot without a warming plate. It eliminates the risk of the coffee tasting burnt. The manual-adjust drip-stop is another unique feature, letting you control the brewing flow, which can be handy if you’re brewing smaller quantities. The simple one-button operation is refreshing in a world of overly complicated appliances. Plus, the 5-year warranty offers peace of mind.
