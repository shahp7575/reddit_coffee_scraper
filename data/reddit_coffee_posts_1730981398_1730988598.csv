I don't use it in my coffee, but I need it for a sauce every now and then. My problem is that no matter how small of a container I buy, the milk always spoils before I have a chance to use it up. Most of the time, I end up buying no more than a quart, but I still end up not using the whole thing. Would it be smart to freeze the milk in a large ice cube tray, and keep them in a freezer bag?

1glr6i6,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1glr6i6/still_struggling/,Still Struggling,"Hi everyone.  As the title says, I'm still struggling with this.  I'm a 49 year-old male and I was diagnosed with type 2 about 6 years ago.  I'm not going to say I've been a star patient since then because that would be a lie.  I've put in some (key word being ""some"") effort over the years, but not enough to get me where I should be.  At my last doctor visit, my A1c was 8.2.  After trying different med combinations that included Metformin (had to stop that  because the side-effects were terrible), Glipizide and Trulicity (which I'm currently taking).  My doctor told me that if I can't get it under control soon, the next step would probably be Jardiance or insulin.  I don't want either.  I'm afraid of Jardiance because I read terrible side effects that include possible necrotizing tissue, and I'm afraid that once I start insulin I may have to stay on it permanently.   I haven't had a single soda since that visit back in June and I'm counting carbs like I never have before and I've increased my exercise.  I'm always the first one up in my family, and one of my favorite things to do is to have a pb&j with coffee and watch the news while the rest of my family is still sleeping.  I enjoy the quiet time.  But I can't really do that anymore.  If I even look at a cup of coffee, my sugar can jolt up to 250.  I know this is the price I'm paying for a lifetime of bad eating (going back to childhood ( I was raised on fast food and soda- a habit I picked up from my mom).  I married a woman who is a great cook, but usually makes things with cheese, pasta, etc.  My wife and kids are, thankfully not diabetic, and neither are her parents, just me.  It can be difficult to be around everyone and all the stuff they can eat that if I eat could send me into a coma.  I'm surrounded by it.  Grandma always sends the kids back with cookies, cake, cinnamon rolls, etc.  And Halloween was terrible because I have to stare at all the candy.  I feel isolated because no one else around me has this (thankfully).  My wife tries to help me, but there's only so much she can do.  I dread every Thanksgiving.  You don't have to tell me to have more discipline, I know that, and that I should've taken this seriously years ago, I know that too and carry a lot of guilt.  But I'm really trying now.  I just hope it's not too late.  I go back to see my doctor in a a couple weeks and I'm honestly terrified (I try to put a brave face on for my family).

I come from a PC experience with a 5.1 setup and I'm looking the same in my TV: basses, loudness but also clear voices.

This last point is crucial: I just sent back an LG 3.1.2 soundbar because voices were incomprehensible... even music lyrics on Youtube App were distorted!

I've looked on [rtings.com](http://rtings.com) for the best my wallet can afford and choice is on Q800D (\~400$) and Q930D (\~600$). The first is a 5.1.2 solution and should be enough but I am wondering if those 200$ makes a huge difference.

Q930D has back satellites that makes the Surround Experience much more immersive BUT I have a huge problem: my sofa is next to the entrance and I don't like to have coffee tables right into your knees when you enter your house; nor having them wall-mounted above, they would be an eyesore. Here's why my interest into the Q800D: I have only to worry about soundbar and sub.

My partner and I split up recently (back together now) for about a month. During that time, 3 guys I already knew popped up. One took me for lunch (he's married-we can call him M), one I knew through working in the same industry and we went for coffee to discuss collaborating (in a relationship - he's R) and the 3rd I went out for drinks with (his friends and mine were both there too, so it was more of a social than any sort of date). 3rd guy is single (S).

After the lunch date, M starts sending me drunken messages at 1 - 2am repeatedly. Literally trying to get me to have an affair with him. I really respected him before this. Blocked. 

R started asking me weird questions about ""is it ok to flirt with friends"" and made a comment along the lines of ""if I wanted you I could have you"". Nope, bye. 

S was fine for the most part. After my experiences with M and R, I decided to make it clear I was not interested romantically, just looking for friendship and the possibility of working together on something in the future (again, similar industries). He was fine with that. We still talk occasionally on messenger but nothing heavy. Then we saw eachother at the gym a week or so after me and my partner sorted things out and he was with me. Since then, he's been ....off. I was meant to go to an event with him (we both have kids similar in age) but when I was messaging him about it, he was giving an off vibe, being awkward about answering questions and contradicting himself. When I said I wasn't going to come, I got a thumbs up. 

I mention all of this because this is so recent. My past tells a similar story of men only wanting to be friends so they could try a sleep with me or date me. 

So here's the dilemma. My partner has a long term female friend. I haven't even met her properly (like once in passing for a minute or two). She is married, they have been friends for years and regularly go on walks together. I won't lie, I hate it. Yes my own experiences cloud my judgement and this isn't a maturity issue.i trust HIM but I don't KNOW her. And my feeling is that there is always one person of the male/female friendship that likes the other. If they were seeing eachother in a group setting, I'd not have an issue,but going to walks and one on one time is just not something I'm comfortable with.

Stability and Consolidation on the Menu - GME 11/7 Open Interest Price Movement Forecast and Options Analysis,"Welcome back to another edition of **Open Interest** \- the only GME price movement forecast dedicated to an analysis of the options market!

[2021: Who wore it better?](https://preview.redd.it/os4mavedugzd1.png?width=1167&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fa1942a57096a65c28e24d05854d69c5c7d047e)

I've seen many disappointed by the lack of significant intraday appreciation on our Stonk amid SPY and QQQ All-Time Highs from the Donald Pump. Consolidation at $23 is nothing to shake a stick at, however. And consider these headlines:

https://preview.redd.it/2ybsdbyvihzd1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=3df77fbcfb3970f7e855bea341330d513a64e5b7

Look, maybe all of this is actually true for the next four years to come... but if MSM is hitting us with this repeatedly today after hitting ATHs, I'm exercising caution here. In such circumstances, the fact that GME did not straight pump yesterday I would consider to be a good sign - indicating GME is not super strongly correlated with whatever it is that funds and banks are trying to display with their market pump right now.

These are my thoughts. Now let's get to our data.

**Price Movement Recap**

[11\/7 Trading Day 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/yuvk7qg1zgzd1.png?width=1293&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc8138c2a54320df371da77ece28814080c65adc)

The broader Donald market Pump had most of effects for GME yesterday in our premarket session with our extension up above $24 not reclaimed during our intraday session. Nevertheless, the Stonk indeed find support at $23, which traders took for a reversal trade off the opening test and then kept to some smaller intraday reversals off the $23 gamma position. In general, volume was low with an all-you-can plunder buffet going on throughout the rest of the market. After the predicted IV spike early, our relatively flat trading just above $23 escorted the price down, but still elevated relative to $22-$23 trading range levels. Total sentiment on the day was decidedly bullish and volume moderately elevated at 6.6mil shares traded:

https://preview.redd.it/jrzyl4hg5hzd1.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=68fe402e34b738142ce9ffd99a98299e35b7d762

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

With Max Pain levels remaining constant at $21 and $20 heading into November OPEX, their usefulness for predicting price movement is unclear. Put volume and new OI across both 11/8 and 11/15 are minimal. Indeed fewer than 1,000 Puts are currently ITM for 11/8 weekly expiry! Our entire trading range is Call Gamma dominant and pulling us up into higher trading brackets with each new major expansion of Call OI injected into our proximal ranges.

[11\/8 OI Changes 11\/6-11\/7](https://preview.redd.it/o4a0k3ybxgzd1.png?width=1062&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6fee00935a6ea3bfcf31a4870e3f0109c93f569)

This week's Call OI was relatively stable yesterday with quite a few trades to close at $23 and $25, as well as at deeper ITM strikes, indicating many traders were happy to take profits on yesterday's price action.

[11\/15 OPEX OI Changes 11\/6-11\/7](https://preview.redd.it/4jh14hvn0hzd1.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=13cee578b4a0a66383d667b9f608dafd1e62aa58)

As we look into Nov OPEX, however, we can see that traders are still expanding Call OI positions, especially at $25 - the strike and expiry of our 5,000 block whale on Tuesday - which grew by over 10,000 contracts during yesterday's trading. Sentimentally, volume was tilted decently toward the BID, meaning plenty of short calls were opened (as is tradiSHUN!), but many long calls were sold as well:

https://preview.redd.it/ey7td7175hzd1.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=073a7f3d46961f0e2abad95410969d96482626d3

20 Dec 2024 and 17 January 2025 also saw some Call OI expansion at $25 by several thousand contracts (1,600 and 2,576), notably imbalanced toward the ASK:

https://preview.redd.it/1p95haix5hzd1.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=392a16b544aa0b83cd83f59837080303c2d0bfad

https://preview.redd.it/afahq1016hzd1.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=c38708244a0484690afe8de459c7020bf166ab3a

Sentimentally, therefore, we are a bit mixed as concerns hypothetical imminent big movements upwards, but most major bets seem convinced of the continued stability of our trading in the short term as we have seen in our GEX landscape. We'll turn our attention there next.

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/4p7lckq6xgzd1.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=e81513c910e62ca2bc29c691c8148fe3ac87eb63

So, yes, continued stability across our proximal whole dollar strikes with half-dollar strikes thickening up a bit. $23 has weakened ever so slightly, but our most conspicuous level is $25, which has more than 1/4 of all our total outstanding net call gamma across all expiries (primarily 11/8, 11/15, and 1/17). In the near term, it is a major overhead resistance, but it is also so big it 'pulls' the price up based on the sheer amount of hedging that goes on in relation to it. Our structure continues to project stability with upticks in bullish volume likely accompanied by a high volume of MM hedging flow.

Our most likely trading range today heading into today is in the lower gamma 'groove' of the $23-$24 range, though an interest rate announcement after market hours might try to slip us back into the $22-$23 or ratchet us up one more bracket into the $24-$25 range.

**Technicals**

As we can see here on our daily chart, we've had two solid days of both MACD EMA lines crossing over the signal line. This is major bullish momentum signal if it matters for swing traders of the stock. RSI still has plenty of room to run before showing an overbought signal (RSI > 70) and our elevated prices are starting to accelerate their upward pull on our 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages.

[10\/21-11\/6 4-hr Aggregation Actual with Technical Inquiry Marks](https://preview.redd.it/jia048o3ehzd1.png?width=1496&format=png&auto=webp&s=e872fec52afaa887d1b4358c5afcdb8fd3330d1f)

On our 4-hour chart (180 days) we have the following periodical structure developing which lines up with my doodle projection up on the daily chart. The 50SMA at 4hr aggregation looks to be forming up as a support guiderail. In two days, with appropriate consolidation, we will complete a second period of our current pattern, placing our price movement on a course to test this trend line. It will coincide with our $23 GEX position. Thus, if it can hold this structure over the next three trading days, we can expect another test of the $24 area. 

My only question here with respect to how mark up this chart is the nature of the premarket candle from yesterday and whether it factors into calculations for this particular periodization structure (I'm not sure, I didn't mark the upper red resistance line properly if so). Whether or not this is the case, I would anticipate some sort of $24 test and potential breakthrough into the $24-$25 trading bracket to occur this week, rather than next. Given MM interests as I assume them to be and this technical configuration, I would still anticipate Nov OPEX to come to a close with the $25 calls OTM - but I would love be wrong.

**IV Trends**

[10-Day Mean Implied Volatility](https://preview.redd.it/ma05ipgfhhzd1.png?width=1190&format=png&auto=webp&s=6906cc9ce3e6524d1f004aad8d49a6e47fd67530)

IV is indeed stabilizing at higher levels here (>85%) with our bull trend carrying the price upward and sustaining trading above support points not encountered since July. Consolidation will flatten some of this IV within the mid 80th percentile range, but only price collapse (unlikely given our current gamma situation) will cause a more substantial IV depreciation. 

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

Stable trading conditions continue to be in place as we look for consolidation now at $23. Our current periodic structure is coming to the end of its second iteration over the next few days and, if conserved, will look to iterate once more next week into 11/15 OPEX. This would entail an early week test of $24 and potential 'ratchet up' into the $24-$25 trading bracket. My general outlook is still bullish, but not crazy euphoric breakout just yet. There is current risk of significant downside volatility. Onward!

Cheers and good luck out there!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I rarely hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

It’s also kinda of an unofficial smokers corner too.

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

Age: (estimated) 3 months  

Sex: female, not yet spayed 

Weight: 4 lbs

History: We found Luna in a bush in a grocery store/coffee shop parking lot two weeks ago. Took her to the vet that day, who did bloodwork and said she seemed healthy. Last week, she had a run-in with our large dog, when no one else was in the room. When my partner went into the room (after hearing the hissing and meowing), the dog was cowering in the corner and the kitten was bleeding from her nose. She was lethargic that day but seemed fine the next day and ran, jumped, and played like normal since then. Yesterday morning she was jumping lots, playing happily, getting zoomies, etc. At about lunch time, my partner texted me saying he thought she hurt her leg (I was at work). I mention the dog incident because it's the only thing I can think of that might have caused this, unless she had an issue when we rescued her or if she had some kind of fall (or something falling on her) without us knowing.

Clinical signs: When I came home at around 3:30, I noticed Luna was not using her back legs. She was sort of dragging them and didn't want to move around, though she did use the litter box and climbed up the side of the couch (albeit only using her back legs a little bit). She  would also growl when touched in certain ways.  

We got her into the vet at 5, and they did some exercises to see whether Luna's back legs were responsive, which they seemed to be (not completely, but she can move them). They did an x-ray and saw a small fracture between her mid-back and tail, probably a little closer to the tail. I wish I'd taken a picture of the x-ray but unfortunately I didn't. To me, it seemed small, but I was really upset and didn't take notes. The vet gave her two injections (a narcotic and an anti-inflammatory), told us she needs complete cage rest, and said she would talk to a specialist for further guidance. She mentioned cats are great healers but wasn't able to give much of a prognosis.

Since then, she's been happy to eat and drink water, but she hasn't gone to the bathroom yet. She's in pain but purrs and responds when we pet her (not on her back obviously). They gave us gabapentin, which she had this morning. 

Location: Texas, USA

I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts or feedback on what we can/should be doing, what her prognosis might be, etc. Should we just wait and keep her comfortable? Any tips on her cage setup? We have her in a medium sized dog crate with a flat litter area (part of a cardboard box lid, with a blanket and towels for comfort).

But there are some places I visit which are worth splurging on (maybe due to sheer number of bad one's in the city that make me feel they are worth it?)


1. Peppers my pepperazzi.

I love their pizza's and drinks. Even normal Punjabi food is great too. This has become my go to place now.

1glqvqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1glqvqj/how_eating_less_carbs_helped_me_lose_weight/,How eating less carbs helped me lose weight,"Please be advised this advice is NOT for everyone!! I’m just sharing what worked for me but as with everyone please speak with your doctor before changing your diet. 

Also please keep in mind when I say carbs I am talking about grains. I love veggies and I love fruit.

This morning my boyfriend told me how great I looked and when I looked in the mirror I couldn’t agree more. I never thought I would get to this point. During COVID I was the heaviest I had ever been and I was always tired and looked puffy. Over the years I had tried working out a ton, tracking steps, and counting macros. But if anything it stressed me out more. I wouldn’t even let myself get vanilla syrup in my coffee because the sugar content was so high and would throw off my macros. Even in college I was always bloated and I had a friend say “why do you look pregnant” 

I saw the best results when I stopped doing all of that and simply stopped eating grains. I don’t even work out as much as I should (something I’m working on) but my life truly changed doing this.

During the week I limit grains so I’ll eat salmon with veggies, taco bowls, chicken with sheet pan veggies, etc. and guess what?? On the weekends I’ll still have fast food or go out to dinner but if 80% of my diet is reduced carbs then I’m still seeing the results. This has nothing to do with restricting and I still eat chocolate everyday 

Also not only is this about losing weight but it’s about fueling my body with nutritious foods. I have never eaten more fruits/veggies in my life!

A huge part of this is PROTEIN!! Protein is so so important and without it I would not have the energy that I do. 

I wanted to share this because it’s real, and it worked for me. I went from 145 to 125 pounds (I’m 5’6""). 145 is a completely healthy weight, but I personally wanted to feel more confident in my body.

I know this might upset some people, but I’m just here to be honest about what helped me. I don’t understand why social media has made it so hard to talk openly about avoiding carbs (really it’s grains). Yes, in the past, cutting carbs has been linked an ED mindset, and I get why people feel cautious. But for some of us, it truly WORKS. ",4,1730987443.0,WeightLossAdvice,3,1.0,False

I had worked in high-end catering during and after college, so I had some tricks for making hack jobs look professional, but I got SO many key tips from this sub. Paying it forward here. 

TL;DR: it can be done. 

**Venue**

With a short timeline, even the cheapest venues available would have been $5000+. At-home was the only option. As new empty-nesters, we scored a half-finished new build outside of Austin mid-COVID. It was the first time we ever came out ahead from an unstable real estate market and we ended up with a nice one-story on an acre lot. We couldn't have handled a much bigger crowd, but it worked for 36 and the weather allowed us to have the ceremony on the deck. 

(We have friends with a similar size home who were hosting 80, which they accommodated with a tent and port-a-potties.) 

**Food: 100% grocery store (HEB in Texas; I'd have used Trader Joe's elsewhere)**

11am wedding/brunch-style reception. This saved a ton of money. We did a huge breads display. Bread is cheap. Go with visual variety--tall baguettes, sliced sandwich breads (eg, pumpernickel and white), mini-muffins, croissants, and mini-bagels. On one side we had a charcuterie board with deli meats and cheeses and on the other we did a hummus board (vegan) and a giant bowl of vegan pesto pasta salad. We also had trays of pickles, olives, nuts, fruits, and condiments--both plain and fancy. 

Bridal cake was two plain white cakes from the grocery store bakery. Got an insider tip that putting the small cake on top of the large cake yourself costs way less than ordering a tiered cake. It took three wooden skewers to secure it and three of us to make the transfer, but it worked. We covered two smudges in the frosting with white rosebuds--just stuck 'em right in there and no one was the wiser. 

The groom's sister made chocolate whoopie pies in lieu of a groom's cake and they looked super cute on a pretty cake stand next to the bride's cake. 

Pretty baskets, plates, cheesecloth drapery, cheap white tablecloths, and greenery from my back yard made it look fancier than it was. Presentation is half the battle. 

  
**Drinks**

We had one pitcher each of iced coffee, tea, and water. The coffee was set up alongside a keurig and fancy syrups. More popular was the DIY mimosa bar with juices, bottles of dry prosecco, and fruit garnishes. I underestimated how much alcohol people would drink so early in the day and should have had 6 bottles instead of 3. We ran out. Apparently lots of guests skipped the juice. At the last-minute suggestion of a family member, I loaded our outdoor fridge with cans of beer, rosé, and sparkling water. Again, surprised by how much beer guests drank, but the supply held out. 

  
**Flowers**

This sub for the WIN! I got $40 worth of flowers from the grocery store and kept them in buckets of water the night before the wedding. The bridesmaid bouquets were a mix of white and purple asters tied with dark purple velvet ribbon (which was expensive and I draped everywhere) and twine. The bride's bouquet was a dozen white roses with pink tips tied with twine and white satin ribbon. We put the leftover asters and some burgundy mums on tables with food. 

I will recap other elements in a part 2. Hope this is as helpful to others as advice from this sub was for me.

Honestly, if you’d told me before that an AI could save my life, I’d probably have laughed. But here we are, Reddit.

I was working late, as usual, on a project that had me glued to my screen for hours. It was one of those nights where I was totally in the zone, right? Time just flew by. Around 2 AM, I realized my chest felt kind of tight and I was feeling off. I shrugged it off as usual work stress and lack of sleep – maybe too much caffeine, y’know? I went back to my work but kept feeling weird.

For some reason, I decided to ask ChatGPT about my symptoms. I wasn't even thinking it was serious, just curious. I typed in a bunch of stuff: ""What could be causing chest tightness, dizziness, and nausea?"" expecting some bland response about needing to get more sleep or cut back on the coffee.

But ChatGPT actually took it pretty seriously. It asked about other symptoms – shortness of breath, sweating, etc. – and by then, yeah, I realized I had those too. ChatGPT then gave me a response that literally made me pause mid-sentence: “These symptoms could be serious and may indicate a cardiac event or other medical emergency. Please consider seeking medical attention immediately.”

At that moment, it hit me how not-normal I was feeling. It was like a lightbulb went off. I was hesitating because, I mean, it’s 2 AM, who wants to go to the hospital for what could just be anxiety or something, right? But ChatGPT's response kept popping into my head, and something told me I shouldn’t ignore it. I grabbed my keys and drove to the ER, feeling ridiculous the whole way there.

And here’s the kicker – the doctors told me I was in the early stages of a heart attack. They were able to treat it right away, and they said if I had waited even an hour or so longer, it could have been a whole different story.

I’m still kind of stunned. ChatGPT doesn’t diagnose, obviously, but the fact that it pushed me to take my symptoms seriously when I might have brushed them off… I mean, it really did save my life. Thanks to AI, I get to share this story instead of my family having to tell it for me.

Anyway, just wanted to share with the world – and maybe remind people that if something feels off, don’t ignore it. Sometimes a little advice from an unexpected source can be life-changing.",140,1730987390.0,ChatGPT,26,0.97,False

The small fairground glowed softly under the deepening evening sky, a cozy warmth settling over it despite the bite of the cool autumn air. Overhead, strings of lights stretched between wooden poles, casting a flickering glow that painted the pathways in soft halos. The lights wavered like fireflies in the distance, creating a patchwork of gold against the dark, almost inky blue of the sky. Stars dotted the heavens, faint and far-off, nearly hidden by the brightness of the fair, as though the universe itself had decided to give them privacy tonight.

Around them, the low hum of conversation mingled with bursts of laughter and excited shouts from children darting through the crowd, faces sticky with cotton candy and hands clutching bright, plastic prizes. A steady stream of music drifted over from the carousel, the familiar, lilting melody blending with the occasional clang and rattle of carnival games, the voices of vendors calling out to passersby with promises of ""one more chance to win!"" The scents that filled the air were thick and sweet—caramel apples, fresh popcorn, and a hint of cinnamon from the churros sizzling in deep fryers. Each smell beckoned, inviting them to forget, if only for a moment, the strange realities they had been navigating.

Jason and Lily strolled hand-in-hand, their fingers laced together, grounding them as they moved through the crowd. Their pace was unhurried, almost languid, as if they had nowhere to be, and every step was just another part of the night’s embrace. They leaned into each other as they walked, sharing warmth as they stopped to take bites of the spun sugar melting on their tongues. They could feel the world around them in every sense—the laughter echoing, the distant sound of the Ferris wheel creaking as it turned, the metallic clang of rings hitting glass bottles in the game stalls.

The air held a slight chill, enough to flush their cheeks and bring a briskness to their steps, but it only added to the enchantment of the night. The fairground’s lights glowed with an inviting warmth, drawing couples and families toward booths lined with stuffed animals and colorful trinkets. It felt safe, almost timeless, as if they had entered a sanctuary where, for a few precious hours, the world would wait for them.

Jason glanced at Lily, noting the way the lights cast shadows across her face, her eyes reflecting the brightness around them like tiny mirrors. She caught his gaze and gave him a soft smile, and for a moment, he felt like they were alone, hidden from the strange forces that had been haunting them. Here, in this fleeting world of laughter and lights, there were no mysteries to unravel, no memories blending and blurring. Just the crisp night air, the warm scent of caramel, and her hand in his.

They walked past booths and stalls, taking in the sights and sounds, trying to lose themselves in the simplicity of the evening. It was a night stolen from another world, a place where the only questions they asked were which ride to go on next or which treat to share.

“Hey, look!” Lily said, her voice bubbling with excitement as she pointed to a small tent tucked away at the far edge of the fairground. Hidden behind a row of colorful pop-up game booths, the tent seemed almost forgotten, as though it belonged to another era. A wooden sign hung above the entrance, painted with peeling letters that read, *Madame Vira’s Mystical Visions – Fortune Teller Extraordinaire*. The script was ornate, curling and twisting as if inviting only the most curious to enter.

The tent itself was draped in dark, thick fabric, heavy and foreboding, like the folds of an old, musty curtain. The material seemed to absorb the light around it, creating a stark contrast to the brightness of the fairground. The only illumination came from a dull, red glow that seeped out through the tent’s entrance, casting eerie shadows across the trampled grass. The red light pulsed faintly, as if alive, shifting in a way that made the tent seem to breathe, inhaling and exhaling in rhythm with the muted hum of the fair.

Jason felt a flicker of unease creep over him as he looked at it, a sense that the tent didn’t quite belong here. It seemed too old, too worn and frayed around the edges, as if it had seen countless fairs come and go. The shadows spilling out onto the fairground stretched long and twisted, distorting the figures of passersby into strange, elongated shapes that melted back into the darkness as they moved away. A cold shiver ran down his spine as he looked at the entrance, feeling a strange dread settle in his stomach, an instinct telling him that whatever lay inside was best left alone.

Lily, however, was practically glowing with excitement, her eyes dancing with mischief as she tugged on his arm. “Come on, it’ll be fun!” she insisted, her smile widening as she took in the ominous details of the tent. For her, it was all part of the fair’s charm—a touch of mystery and wonder that made the night feel like an adventure, a story waiting to unfold. The fairground had always filled her with childlike delight, a sanctuary from reality where each ride and game felt like an invitation to let go and believe in the impossible, if only for a night.

Jason hesitated, feeling the weight of dread pressing against his chest. But as he looked at Lily, her face alight with excitement, he felt his resistance soften. He could see the thrill in her eyes, the way she practically vibrated with enthusiasm, and he didn’t have the heart to deny her this small adventure. For her, the fair was magic; for him, it was simply a place to be with her, to share in the moment.

He took a deep breath, swallowing his unease, “A fortune teller? Really?”

“Oh, come on,” Lily teased, nudging him. “We could use a little distraction, don’t you think? Plus, it’ll be fun.” She tugged him toward the tent, her eyes bright with excitement and a hint of mischief.

Jason sighed, rolling his eyes with a smile as he followed her. “Fine, but if she starts telling us about tall, dark strangers, I’m walking out.”

Lily laughed, pulling him through the tent’s narrow opening, and they stepped into a world that felt as if it had been plucked from another time. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of incense, rich and smoky, mingling with a faint hint of sandalwood and herbs. It clung to their clothes and filled their lungs, heavy and almost stifling, like stepping into the depths of a forgotten temple.

The red glow that had seemed so ominous outside now emanated from a single, tall candle flickering on a low wooden table in the center of the room. The candle’s flame danced, casting shadows that moved across the interior like ghostly figures. The tent’s walls were lined with shelves that sagged under the weight of strange, glittering objects: crystals in every color, worn leather-bound books, weathered talismans, and intricately carved figurines that looked as if they’d been collected from ancient places.

The furniture was old and worn, yet strangely luxurious, as if it had once belonged in an elegant parlor. The table was scuffed and scratched, but its surface gleamed with a dark, polished richness. Two plush, velvet chairs sat across from the fortune teller’s seat, their fabric faded but still retaining hints of deep red and gold, embroidered with intricate patterns. The edges were frayed, and a few loose threads dangled from the armrests, but the chairs carried a sense of forgotten opulence, a touch of faded grandeur that seemed strangely fitting in the eerie light.

Behind the table sat the fortune teller, Madame Vira. She was an older woman, her skin lined with the faint marks of time, though her eyes gleamed with an unsettling sharpness. Her hair, streaked with gray, was tied back in a loose, messy braid that fell over one shoulder, adorned with small charms and beads woven into the strands. She wore layers of richly colored fabrics—shawls and scarves in deep purples, midnight blues, and flashes of silver that shimmered as she moved. Her fingers were adorned with rings of all shapes and sizes, each one glinting in the candlelight, their stones dark and mysterious.

Her gaze was intense, piercing as she studied them, her eyes like embers that seemed to hold centuries of wisdom—and secrets. Her expression was serene yet heavy, as though she were not merely looking at them but through them, reading things they could not see. Jason felt a chill run down his spine, a prickle of awareness, as though this woman understood more about him than he understood himself.

Her smile was faint, almost hidden, yet undeniably knowing, as if she were aware of things they were yet to learn. She sat with her hands folded neatly on the table, her fingers tapping gently, a steady rhythm that matched the flickering of the candle’s flame. Her mannerisms were calm, measured, every movement precise and deliberate, giving her an air of quiet authority.

“Welcome,” she said, her voice rich and smooth, each word carrying a weight that made Jason’s skin prickle with unease. “Please, sit.”

As they settled into the worn velvet chairs, Jason felt an unsettling sense of anticipation coil within him, his pulse quickening in the dim red glow. The weight of the room seemed to press down on them, as if every corner held secrets waiting to be uncovered. Madame Vira’s gaze flicked between them, lingering with an intensity that made him feel exposed, as though she could see straight through his carefully constructed thoughts. She leaned forward, her fingers lightly tracing the edge of the table, her eyes dark and steady.

“Jason… Lily…it’s good to see you again” she began, her voice soft but weighted, each word sinking into the quiet of the room like stones.

Jason’s spine stiffened, his hand instinctively tightening around Lily’s. They hadn’t told her their names. He opened his mouth to say something, to demand how she could know, but Lily beat him to it, her voice a mix of unease and curiosity.

“How… how do you know our names?” she asked, her eyes wide as they locked onto Madame Vira’s.

The fortune teller’s lips curled into a faint, enigmatic smile, and she held their gaze with a look of quiet certainty. “Because this is not the first time you’ve come to see me,” she murmured, her voice threaded with a strange, almost sorrowful nostalgia. “And it will not be the last.”

Jason exchanged a look with Lily, his heart pounding, his mind racing. “What… what are you talking about?” he asked, his voice edged with disbelief. “We’ve never been here before. We’ve never met you.”

Madame Vira’s gaze softened, as if she pitied their confusion. “You may not remember, but your souls remember,” she replied, her fingers tapping lightly on the table, a quiet, rhythmic pulse that matched the strange tension in the air. “You find me each time, drawn by the same force that pulls you together. Over and over, you come to me seeking answers, but rarely do you heed my warnings.”

A chill crept down Lily’s spine as she looked into Madame Vira’s eyes, seeing something ancient and unyielding there. “So… we’ve met you in other lives? Other worlds?” she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Madame Vira nodded slowly, a shadow crossing her face. “Yes. In one form or another, you are always drawn back to this moment, to the edge of a choice that could change everything. But each time, you come to me, hoping for a different truth, a different ending.”

Jason shook his head, refusing to believe it. “This is ridiculous. You’re just trying to scare us. We haven’t met you before—this is the first time we’ve ever set foot in this tent.”

Madame Vira’s expression remained impassive, her eyes fixed on them with a sadness he couldn’t understand. “That’s what you always tell yourselves,” she murmured. “But the truth remains, whether you accept it or not. Your fate circles back to this moment, a pattern that repeats with each life, each world you touch. And unless you choose differently, you will find yourselves here again.”

Jason glanced at Lily, her face etched with doubt and fear, her hand trembling within his. He wanted to pull her away, to dismiss Madame Vira’s words as nothing more than theatrics, a performance crafted to leave them unsettled. But a part of him—a small, unshakable part he couldn’t ignore—felt the weight of her words settle over him like a deep, old ache.

He looked back at Madame Vira, his voice strained, a question bubbling up from a place he didn’t want to acknowledge. “If this is true… if we’ve been here before, why? Why do we keep coming back to you?”

Madame Vira’s gaze softened, a flicker of sadness mingling with the knowing look in her eyes. She held her hands over the table, as though tracing a thread only she could see. “Two souls drawn together from different places,” she murmured, her eyes narrowing, her focus shifting between them, as if she were studying an invisible cord stretched taut between their hearts. “A connection… powerful, but dangerous, bound by the threads of fate, trapped in a cycle of love and destruction.”

Jason felt Lily’s hand tighten in his, her breath catching at Madame Vira’s words. He opened his mouth to argue, to deny this “cycle” the fortune teller claimed they were caught in, but Madame Vira continued, her voice filled with a solemn certainty.

“Your bond is stronger than worlds, more potent than the barriers meant to keep you apart. And so, you find each other, drawn across lifetimes and realities. But each time, your connection pulls against the very fabric of reality, and each time, the same fate awaits. Love that endures beyond reason and a destruction that cannot be avoided… unless you choose differently.”

“What do you mean?” Lily asked, her voice barely a whisper.

Madame Vira’s gaze softened with something akin to pity as she looked between them, but her tone held a grim finality. “You were never meant to be together. Not in this world, or any world.” The words hung heavy in the air, reverberating through the stillness, a quiet echo that seemed to press down on them from all sides.

Jason felt the weight of her words settle into his chest like a stone, an unexplainable fear tightening his grip on Lily’s hand. “That’s… that’s ridiculous,” he said, his voice strained, almost defensive. “We’re just two people who met at the right time. There’s no cycle of fate or—”

Madame Vira’s lips curled into a faint, knowing smile, but her gaze held no amusement. “You may try to dismiss it, Jason, but reality does not bend to your understanding. The bond you share is older than this world, older than either of you, a thread that weaves between worlds… but that thread is frayed, torn by forces beyond your control.” She leaned forward, her eyes piercing. “You are not meant to exist together in this world, and your very presence here is a wound, a crack in the foundation of reality.”

Lily’s face drained of color, her hand trembling as she tried to steady her voice. “But… we’re real,” she said, her tone wavering as she looked to Jason, a desperate plea in her eyes. “We’re here, together, right now. How can you say we don’t belong?”

Madame Vira’s face grew solemn, her tone shifting from mysterious to something darker, almost ominous. “There are forces here you do not understand,” she said softly, her gaze shifting to Lily. “You… were never meant to exist in this world, my dear. Your presence here… it’s a mistake.”

Lily’s face turned ashen, her fingers clutching Jason’s hand tightly. “A mistake?” she whispered, her voice barely audible, as though the very ground beneath her had shifted.

Madame Vira nodded slowly, her gaze sharp and unyielding. “Yes. Your presence here…it creates a rift, a tear in the fabric of reality. The world itself feels it, like a wound festering beneath the surface. Piece by piece, it will begin to unravel… until there is nothing left.”

She leaned forward, her intense gaze fixed on Lily, her words carrying an ominous weight that sent a chill down Jason’s spine. “If you do not leave,” Madame Vira continued, her voice dropping to a grave whisper, “you will take this world with you.”

As if summoned by her words, a deafening clap of thunder cracked overhead, shattering the silence and making both of them jump. Jason’s heart raced, his grip on Lily’s hand tightening as the walls of the tent seemed to shudder around them, trembling as though the very air were charged with energy. They felt the rumble deep in their bones, a heavy vibration that seemed to echo endlessly, reverberating through the ground beneath their feet.

The storm had been nowhere in sight, yet the thunder’s intensity made it feel as though it had been lying in wait, lurking until this very moment to release its fury. Outside, the fairground sounds dulled, voices falling silent as people looked to the sky in confusion, caught off-guard by the sudden eruption from above.

Lily’s hand trembled in his, her face still pale as she glanced at Jason, fear widening her eyes. “Jason… what if she’s right?” she whispered, her voice breaking, barely audible above the echo of thunder still rolling across the sky.

Jason shook his head, trying to steady himself, to stay grounded, but even he felt the crackling energy in the air, as if reality itself had splintered, hanging by a thread. He wanted to tell her it was all nonsense, just a scare tactic, but the woman’s words and the thunder felt too eerily aligned, too pointed to ignore.

The fortune teller’s expression remained solemn, her eyes shadowed yet piercing, fixed intently on them. “Do you see now?” she murmured, her voice cutting through the tense silence left by the thunder. “The world is warning you, child. This is not a place you belong. It will push back, it will resist… until there is nothing left to resist.”

Jason glanced at Lily, her pale face reflecting the same dread that was twisting in his stomach. The weight of Madame Vira’s warning hung between them, dense and suffocating, and just outside, as if echoing their shared fear, another low rumble of thunder rolled across the sky—a quiet reminder of the storm gathering in the distance.

Lily’s voice shook as she finally spoke, gripping Jason’s hand as if it were the only thing anchoring her. “What do you mean I’m not supposed to exist?” she demanded, desperation sharpening her words. “I *do* exist! I’m here! I’m alive!” Her eyes pleaded with Madame Vira, searching for any sign that this was all some dark joke, a test to gauge their reaction. “How can I not be real?”

Madame Vira’s face softened, and for a moment, her gaze held a kind of quiet pity that only made the truth she spoke feel more unsettling. “Not here, not now,” she murmured, her voice low but steady, each word laced with an ancient weight that made Jason’s skin prickle. “You are a reflection—a shadow cast from another world, another life. You belong somewhere else, a place where your presence does not disrupt the delicate balance of existence.”

Jason, frowning, looked from Madame Vira to Lily, confusion and fear mixing in his gaze. “But she’s here *now.* She’s real, just as real as I am. How can you say she doesn’t belong?”

Madame Vira’s gaze turned to him, her eyes as dark and inscrutable as the depths of the ocean. “Jason, you see her, feel her, love her in this world… but her presence here is like a splinter in your skin. She wasn’t meant to be here, and her being here weakens the boundaries that hold your world together. Each moment she remains, the very fabric of reality strains, like a delicate web trembling under a weight it was never meant to bear.”

Lily’s eyes glistened with the effort to hold back tears. “I don’t understand,” she whispered, a tremor in her voice. “You’re saying I’m just… a mistake? An accident that doesn’t belong?”

Madame Vira shook her head gently, her expression unreadable. “Not an accident,” she said softly, her voice tinged with regret. “But a choice—a pull from somewhere deep within you both. Your souls reached across the divide, through lifetimes and realities, to find each other. And while love is a powerful force, it is not without consequences. The two of you, bound as you are, are creating a fracture, a wound in the very world that sustains you.”

Jason’s frustration bubbled over, and he squeezed Lily’s hand tightly. “So what are we supposed to do?” he demanded, his voice tight. “If we’re not supposed to be together, then why did we find each other at all? Why go through all this if it’s just going to destroy everything?”

Madame Vira’s gaze lingered on him, a mixture of sympathy and resignation in her eyes. “Because some things are meant to be… and yet not meant to last,” she replied, her words heavy with the sorrow of ancient knowledge. “The pull between you was too strong, powerful enough to bend the rules, to bridge worlds. But now you face a choice: to let each other go and allow this world to heal, or to remain together and watch it unravel, piece by piece.”

Lily’s grip tightened, her face stricken. “But… can’t we find a way to stay? Isn’t there a way for us to be together?”

Madame Vira sighed, her eyes darkening. “Some choices carry too great a price. The longer you stay, the more the boundaries will weaken, pulling pieces from one world into another until neither world is left whole. If you remain together, reality will warp around you, and in the end, there will be nothing left for either of you.”

A deep silence filled the tent, heavy and stifling, as Lily and Jason exchanged a look filled with both love and fear. Another rumble of thunder rolled through the air, faint but unyielding, as if the universe itself were offering its warning, pressing down upon them, urging them to understand the cost of their bond.

“Do you see?” Madame Vira said softly, her voice barely more than a whisper. “Your love, as beautiful as it is, was born from worlds that cannot hold it. It is a force too strong for this reality, a fire that will consume everything if you let it burn.”

The air in the tent felt heavy, charged with an invisible weight that pressed down on them, each word from Madame Vira sinking into Lily like stones settling in her chest. She could almost see it—a world beyond this one, hazy and indistinct, a place where she might belong completely in a way she could never feel here. Fragments flickered through her mind, like pieces of a dream just beyond reach: familiar landscapes blurred by time, people who felt known but unseen, echoes of herself moving through spaces that didn’t fit within this reality.

Jason shifted beside her, his own face pale and tense as he looked between Lily and Madame Vira. His voice was steady, though tinged with disbelief and frustration. “How do you know all this?” he demanded, his words thick with skepticism. “Who even are you? And how can you possibly know about… other worlds, other versions of us?”

Madame Vira’s gaze settled on him, dark and unreadable, and a faint, almost bitter smile touched her lips. “Who am I?” she repeated, her tone carrying a hint of amusement layered with a weary wisdom. “I am a conduit, a keeper of secrets, a witness to cycles that stretch beyond the reaches of time and space. I know because I have seen it, time and time again. I have watched souls like yours—drawn together across the divide, pulled back and forth, breaking and reforging, trapped in cycles of love and loss, hope and ruin. I know because it is my burden to know, to watch these truths unfold while others remain blind.”

She leaned forward, her voice lowering to a whisper that seemed to draw the air from the room itself. “Your world—this world—was never meant to hold her. Lily belongs to a place just out of reach, a world that mirrors this one but exists on a different plane. But the bond you share defies the natural order. It pulled her across the boundary, a force so strong it altered the fabric of reality. And now that bond, that pull, threatens to unravel everything—like a thread tugged from a fragile seam until all that remains are broken fragments.”

Lily’s voice was barely steady as she spoke, her mind struggling to process the enormity of Madame Vira’s words. “But if I leave… what happens then?”

Madame Vira’s gaze softened, though her expression remained somber. “If you leave, reality will heal itself. The rift will close, and the balance will be restored. But if you stay…” She hesitated, her eyes shifting to Jason, who stared back at her, torn between fear and defiance. “If you stay, everything you know—everything he knows—this world and everyone in it will begin to fracture. Memories will seep through boundaries, identities will blur, and reality itself will warp under the strain. It will twist, pulling in pieces of your world and his until both are left in ruin.”

Jason’s heart pounded, his mind pushing back against every word, refusing to accept her warning. “So, you’re saying that just because we… because we care about each other, because we met, that everything we know will collapse?” His voice shook with disbelief, his mind scrambling to find some flaw in her logic, some way to unravel her words as easily as she had unraveled their understanding of their lives.

Madame Vira sighed, meeting his gaze with a weariness that seemed older than time itself, a sorrow born from witnessing too many others caught in the same relentless cycle. “Love is a powerful force, Jason. It binds, it strengthens, it defies… but it does not always heal. Sometimes, love and reality cannot exist side by side. The bond you share with her is one that reaches beyond this world, a thread that stretches across boundaries that were never meant to be crossed.”

Lily’s hand slackened in his, her expression shifting to one of quiet horror as the gravity of the situation took hold. “So… I’m a danger,” she murmured, her voice barely a whisper. “Just by being here, I’m… I’m hurting this world.”

Madame Vira nodded slowly, her voice soft but unyielding, each word carrying a weight that seemed to deepen the silence around them. “Yes. This is not your fault, and it was never your choice. But this world, this fragile reality—it cannot contain you, nor can it withstand the force of the connection between you and Jason. Reality is already beginning to strain; you have felt it, seen it. Objects appearing and vanishing, memories slipping into your mind like fragments of forgotten dreams. These are only the first signs. As time goes on, the fractures will deepen, and eventually, reality itself will shatter under the weight.”

Lily’s grip on Jason’s hand tightened as memories of the odd, inexplicable moments flashed through her mind. Her voice wavered, almost as if she were speaking more to herself than to Madame Vira. “The coffee shop walls… they were green, but I could have sworn they were brown. I kept telling Jason they’d been painted, and he kept saying they hadn’t changed.”

Madame Vira’s expression softened, her gaze tinged with sympathy. “Yes, child. That was a glimpse of the coffee shop in your world, a place where the walls truly are brown. The inconsistencies you see, the small shifts—a color that doesn’t belong, an object that appears out of place, a face you think you recognize but shouldn’t know—they are more than confusion. They are the first signs, small rips in the fabric of this world. They signal that reality is beginning to unravel under the strain of your presence here.”

Jason glanced at Lily, and she nodded, recalling yet another moment. “Like the time we both ordered pie,” she murmured. “Jason’s family always got cherry, but I could swear we’d had blueberry, even though he said they’d never ordered it.”

Madame Vira nodded knowingly. “These memories you both carry—these ‘fragments,’ as you call them—they are reflections of a world you once knew, a world your heart still remembers even if your mind does not. That is why they feel so vivid, so real. Your two realities are colliding, bringing echoes of each world into the other. For now, it is pie flavors and colors of walls, minor details that create subtle disturbances. But as time passes, those small inconsistencies will grow more pronounced.”

Jason felt a shiver run down his spine as he thought of what she was saying. “So… what happens if we ignore it?”

Madame Vira’s expression darkened. “Then you will see more than colors and flavors changing. Imagine pieces of the landscape altering before your eyes—buildings that flicker between forms, faces that seem familiar yet shift into strangers. You will see entire memories begin to fade and blur, voices that sound like whispers, as your world and her world battle for dominance. It will start with brief lapses, brief moments of ‘remembering’ that feel like deja vu. But soon, reality itself will begin to fracture: time may skip, people may forget who they are, entire parts of your world may simply disappear as hers tries to overlay it.”

Jason’s heart pounded as he looked at Lily, a storm of fear and frustration churning inside him. “So… you’re saying all these little things—the differences we’ve noticed—they’re actually from *her* world?” He shook his head, struggling to make sense of it all. “But why now? Why is it only happening since we met?”

Madame Vira’s eyes softened, her expression grave as she looked between them. “Because, Jason, your meeting was the catalyst. Your connection, your love—it is what allowed her to cross over, what lets her memories and echoes slip into this world. Love as powerful as yours does not know boundaries. It reaches beyond reason, beyond realms. When you two came together, you created an anchor, a bridge that binds her world to yours. And every memory, every inconsistency you encounter, weakens that bridge, making it more fragile with each passing day.”

Lily’s face turned pale, her mind racing back to every detail that had felt just slightly… wrong. The colors that didn’t match, the flashes of déjà vu, the strange sensation of feeling like she was both here and somewhere else. It was as if parts of her existed in places she could barely reach. “So… all the things I remember that don’t fit,” she whispered, her voice trembling, “they’re from… somewhere else. My world.”

“Yes,” Madame Vira said gently, though her words were unyielding. “And the more you try to reconcile these memories with his reality, the more strain you create—like a storm building beneath the surface. You are in a place you do not belong, Lily, and that discord is tearing reality apart, one small fracture at a time.”",1,1730987374.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1glqt3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Celiac/comments/1glqt3c/traveling_tricks_it_does_get_easier/,Traveling tricks.. it does get easier! ,"I was diagnosed last May and like everyone, really struggled. I travel domestically frequently for work and it was tough. Super tough. I starved. I overate when I found safe food (I still do this to an extent), I filled myself with pirates booty and chips and protein bars and felt like shit. 

This is an ever evolving process but I figured I’d share some tips I’ve learned. These won’t work for everyone, but if a few people take away at least one thing, that’s a win. 

Grocery stores: most of the locations I travel to have a grocery store fairly close. It took me a long time to realize I could hit the grocery store. I know that sounds dumb, but this was all really foreign to me. 

If my hotel has a fridge: pre-cooked chicken strips, GF tortillas, mini sweet peppers, lettuce, individual ranch cups, and mini carrot bags. 

If my hotel has a microwave: potatoes, pre-cooked rice packets, GF oatmeal packs (if you can handle oatmeal) and Asian noodle cups. McDougals are great for this. 

Non-fridge & microwave: Jerekey, grapes, apples,  chips (terra), GF pretzels. 

If my hotel has neither, usually the office I’m working in has one or either of these I can use. 

A few notes on the above before I move on. 

The carrots, wraps, jerky, and sweet peppers usually end up on the flight home with me. I used to throw them away when I was done (and my trips are usually just two - three days) and one day I realized I could just toss them in my carry on and they’re all fine for a 2-4 hour flight. 

You can cook baked potatoes in the microwave! Had no idea. This really helps me with the low energy from not eating enough. Poke some holes, pop it in the microwave for 10 min and you’re ready to go. 

Utensils: I keep a fold up fork in a little case and a fold up spoon in a little case in my backpack. I got these on amazon and they’re life savers. They’re about the size of an AirPod case and a little lighter. They have a clip on them so when I’m done I either rinse or wipe down (wash later) and clip them back to my backpack so I never lose them. 

Can’t tell you how many times I finally secured food only to realize I didn’t have utensils. I also used to keep to-go silverware in my backpack and I’d often find it broken. 

Oatmeal packets: for those that can do oatmeal, this has been a game changer for me. 

Two options for oatmeal: 

1. hot water from a coffee machine. These can usually be found at gas stations and sky clubs. You can put the oatmeal in a coffee cup, throw a lid on it, and plug the hole with multiple stirrer sticks to keep the heat in. Usually 6 or so fit in there. Let it sit for about 10 min. It’s not the best oatmeal in the world, but it’s better than nothing at an airport or on the road! 

You can also keep individual peanut butter packs or cups in your backpack to beef up the oatmeal if that’s will be your only meal for a while. Can also add bananas. It’s great when a sky club has these, but if they don’t or that’s not an option for you, you can usually find one at the coffee shops in the airport on the checkout counter or at the stores with cold sections for cheese etc. 

2. Heated in the microwave, but you need a microwave safe bowl. I’m usually able to secure on the these from my hotel or the office I’m working from. 

Sky clubs: fruit is about it. 

Airport stands: chocolate milk, cheese sticks, GF jerky (archer is usually available), wrapped fruit, popcorn (boomchicka-pop). 

I also keep one of those microwave rice packs in my backpack. 

The GF noodles (McDougalls is my new fave) are good to keep in the hotel room and take with you if you don’t have a microwave in your room, but have access in another location. I’ve found it’s not always ideal to fly with them though. Easy to crush or break open. 

I also keep my backpack stocked with chomps, protein bars, and a glass container I bring with grapes when I leave home. The glass container is bulky and heavy, but celiac sucks and it can double as your oatmeal bowl and that’s just one more meal I wouldn’t otherwise get to have. So I’ll take bulky. 

Back to the fridge items quickly: I make GF wraps. Lettuce, pre-cooked chicken, ranch, and the sweet peppers. I usually bite the tops off the peppers, pull them apart to get the seeds out, and toss em in there. This a good, solid, healthy meal. 

Some things that don’t work: grapes in ziplocks. Mushy mess. Plastic silverware (as mentioned earlier). Buying cans without pull tabs. 

Try to buy all of this outside of the airport and take it with you. Obviously significantly cheaper, but that’s not always an option. I paid $12.99 for a small bag of archer jerky last week out of desperation in an airport. Saw the same bag at the grocery store last night on sale for $4.89 so I bought them all and put one in backpack for this trip. 

Of course, these are all different options you can try, modify, take or leave for what works for you. I’ve had a LOT of trial and error and this is the first trip this year that I’ve felt kind of calm regarding eating. I’ve had over 50 flights this year. 

Even after learning all of these tips, I still find myself starved, annoyed, in tears, or low energy sometimes if I don’t plan well enough or just don’t plan at all. 

A few weeks ago I spent $30 to Uber to a dedicated GF restaurant that I’d mapped out days before. It burnt to the ground the day before. I mean, c’mon. 

Later I realized I could order uber eats from there. In my mind, delivery services were off limits due to the risk, but I never thought about dedicated GF places being an option. It cost me $80 for 4 meals, but I was able to keep myself fed for 3 days. Who cares if you’re eating teriyaki chicken and broccoli for brekky with this life. 

All of this to say, it’s never going to be as easy as those that were chosen to be able to eat anywhere. Ive walked 3 miles round trip to go to the grocery store when I didn’t have a rental car. And paid stupid money to uber to restaurants. It’s not ideal. AT ALL. Planning is required and spur of the moment plans are less feasible, but if you plan ahead, and keep some stuff packed in your bags, IT DOES GET EASIER!! IT DOES GET EASIER!! You just have to be smarter than what you’re working with. 

Good luck and thanks for reading my novel.

I mostly stopped because I was able to eat in a low carb and manageable way, which has now become unmanageable. 

On keto, not only did I lose weight, I felt better and I was more alert. For context, I am currently 34 years old, female, and have one child. I had my child in 2019, and then the subsequent pandemic that occurred led me to gain more weight than I think my frame could handle. When I started doing keto, there was a bit of a struggle staying consistent. I'm having that same struggle now, which I found surprising because I thought it would be easy to fall back into the old habits I had but in fact it's harder. Even though I know better, I still find myself grabbing carb-filled snack. I have felt myself not only gain weight back, but I am feeling less alert. One of the ways I've tried to transition back is by having bulletproof coffees in the morning, which used to curb my Hunger for a long period of time until noon. So far it hasn't been working. Does anybody have any tips on how I should slowly integrate back in to reduce any keto flu and ensure that I am getting into ketosis within the next two weeks? ",1,1730986876.0,keto,1,1.0,False

My ex gf (let’s call her T) and I began dating right before I moved in for my freshman year of college a little over three years ago. I had been in a serious relationship prior; in fact, I was just coming out of one. T had not ever been in a relationship, hadnt had her first kiss, etc. 

T and I had what some might call a “fairy tale” relationship, in my opinion. I had never met anyone like her and she would say the same about me. We had a particular niche hobby we were each extremely passionate about and we’d spend hours doing this together and building our bond. We trusted each other with everything. During my freshman year of college, I’d come home every weekend to see her, for no other reason than we both missed each other so much.

During the summer after my freshman year of college, we were back to seeing each other practically every day. Our relationship got only stronger. This is kind of where it gets rocky. About mid-June of 2022, a female friend and neighbor from college that was part of my close friend group I had built over there invited me to visit her parents’ house not far away. I had met her family before. I of course asked T if this was okay and if she was comfortable with it, to which she said yes; she had male friends too that she’d hang out with. 

So I ended up going and spending the day with my college friend, we’ll call her L. We had a good time, I texted T updates about what we were doing, and I ended up staying over longer than expected. I think I was home by 10 or so. 

A couple days later, T mentioned that she felt a little uncomfortable about how long I stayed over with L. She said she trusted me but it just felt a little odd and she almost didn’t say anything. I hugged her, told her I was glad she said something, and reassured her that there was absolutely no attraction in either direction. 

By the time it was time for me to go back to college, I honestly had started to feel a bit claustrophobic in my relationship. I loved her, yes, but seeing one another every day was growing difficult. She also had increasing bouts of anxiety about her herself beginning college at a school about two hours away from mine. This started to get a bit exhausting and I felt like I needed space. 

Right after I moved back up to college, I made the long-thought-about decision to break up with T. Again, I loved her, but I needed space and wanted to focus on making a name for myself and making friends up at school on the weekends; I was 19 years old and felt too “tied down” if that makes sense. The breakup was extremely difficult for her, and it led to us not speaking whatsoever for over two years. 

Here’s where I know I messed up - one situation led to another and roughly a month after T and I broke up, I started dating L, the girl T had mentioned she was worried about. After T saw a post I had with L on instagram, she understandably blocked me on everything and I think that’s what led to the no-contact. 

Let’s fast forward now to March of 2024. I am no longer dating L. I randomly received a follow request from T on instagram, which I accepted and followed back. We never spoke or reached out, but I noticed she’d like my posts and even stories on the app. I figured this was a way for her to ease her way back to be comfortable seeing my image. 

A couple weeks ago, I found a pretty nostalgic video the two of us had made years back. I made the decision to text T and say something like “no pressure to respond to this, but I saw this video and it made my day”. She replied almost immediately, and the two of us began texting back and forth, not even close to as often as before. Just basic stuff two old friends would say to catch up. 

Last week, T sent me the text “maybe we could grab a coffee next time you’re in town”. I happily obliged because I was excited to see her. I’ll be honest, after being in another relationship since T, I always spoke so fondly to my friends of our memories and can honestly say that I often still considered what could’ve been had I not been stupid years earlier. Needless to say I was so excited to get coffee with her. 

We got coffee the other night and sparks flew. It was like we had never left. She is doing incredibly well, as am I, and hearing her voice again was even better than I had imagined. I walked her home after two hours of chatting and expressed my interest to see her again. She smiled and said the same. 

Yesterday, she texts me out of nowhere something along the lines of “it was nice to see you yesterday, but ultimately that has to be it. I’ve worked so hard and I just can’t have you back in my life. Take care”. 

My head has been spiraling since she sent that text. I honestly was really looking forward to seeing her again, and I know I messed up a while back, but I had really wanted to see how it went and where it could go now that we are both in different places in our lives.

Here’s what I need advice on. I want to respect her wish which basically said “I don’t want you to contact me”, but I also want to express to her that I really want to see her again sometime, even if it’s just to formally apologize for everything that went down a couple years back. 

I am assuming that she had some feelings too that she didn’t expect to come back, and that having me back in her life and risking the same situation happening again would be too difficult. I understand that, but I want to make a point that I’ve changed and I feel like I’ve been waiting for a moment like the other night for two years.

I don't mind paying a premium for things I really want or that I think will bring me joy sufficient to justify the cost.  Good coffee is one such thing--I buy whole-bean coffee from a local roaster because I love how it tastes and I like supporting his small, local business.  I thought the Ember mug would also add to my enjoyment of morning coffee, but after 5ish months of use, I find it to be poorly designed, uncomfortable to use, and a waste of money.

I just bought my first Christmas gift and was thinking about others, and for a split-second I thought about giving an Ember mug as a gift.  And then I quickly decided not to for the reasons stated above.

But this got me to wondering if I'm an outlier.

1glqlfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TemuThings/comments/1glqlfx/paying_a_visit/,🏖️🦞 - paying a visit!,"🏖️🦞 here, with a bit of a little reminder as we dig our claws into these Temu games! I’ve noticed something on this sandy beach: everyone wants clicks. We all do, right? But somewhere along the line, it’s turned into a game of ***taking rather than giving***. Folks are holding onto their clicks like pearls, trading only if they get one back or—even worse—just showing up to grab a click knowing they have no clicks available and feigning ignorance when it doesn’t work- no attempt to rectify the the situation the next day in a case of a true mistake (it happens - the games aren’t always clear). Now, I hate to be the crab that calls it like it is, but when people get greedy, life has a funny way of kicking a little sand in their faces.

You see, I’ve got clicks to share, and I’ll give them freely. No strings attached. I don’t want anything in return, because real joy comes when we give for the sake of giving. And when I give a click, I’m not expecting anyone to “pay me back.” I do it just to see my fellow beachgoers reach their goals. Think about it: if we all chipped in a click when we could, we’d all be floating along, collecting our gifts a lot faster—and we’d be having a much better time doing it, too.

So here’s the deal: if you’re looking for a click, I’ve got some available. I’ll update ~~as such~~ when these are used up. But remember, if you’re here only to grab a click and run, just know that kindness has a funny way of making its way back to you—and so does greed.

And now, if you’ve been listening and you feel like sharing a bit of kindness, well, here’s my info. No need to tell me if you do. I don’t need or ***want*** to know if I was 🌞💋’d, because for me, the joy’s in the giving, not the getting.

So let’s remember, folks, blessings come to the good and the greedy alike. But if we really want the kind of joy that lasts longer than a single click, we’re going to have to start thinking beyond ourselves. Give for the sake of giving, and let’s keep our beach bright.

💝 Be more proactive with social & or romantic opportunities (eg TRY to ask for number swaps sooner. I’ll try cos this has been a goal for a while). Also I have some ideas that might help with the social part we’ll see. (Romantically proactive includes approaching but it varies according to the person what my plan is.  No, I’m not referring to how attractive I perceive them, but something else.) 

💝 Start - after asking permission! - sending CV and cover letter when sufficiently tweaked to relevant LinkedIn contacts and agencies.  Upload to some relevant sites & where you have a less optimal one, replace it with this one. 

💝I will probably some kind of job hunting routine this month but that depends how much I learn - with help! to tailor a cv to a particular role. I will figure out some kind of routine for looking at the different sites & dealing with any emotions that arise around this, some kind of plan.  So I will put that together this month & all going well, start using it this month, even if it starts the last week of this month. 

💝 Be more consistent (with a few things although overall that’s improved a LOT) inc. manifestations & abundance journal prompt

💝 More consistent with my “what I did right today” prompts DAILY!!!

💝 Aim to once a wk or at least once a fortnight? read my: things that make me a good: gf/friend/employee etc lists. 

💝 Social things - I’m aiming to go to an event on this Sat that might help with my social skills further (or not but I’ll go and see!) but also do at least one more offline thing and maybe at least one more online social zoom (done one already & have said yes to going to a work social at the volunteer job later this month.  Will aim to catch up with Ruth for coffee again this month.  Worst case scenario, max a coffee in the new year! 

💝 Maintaining the good habits, gym etc. 

💝 INCLUDING!! Doing well with mindset overall lately although it got challenging again to be recently. Keep doing what you can to maintain the things that help.

Sorry I wrote a novel but this DOES help.  Thank you.  

Oh and finally! I will aim to have a quick look at this list once a week to remind myself. ",1,1730985920.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False
1glqcpk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1glqcpk,Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano ,"I was left quite disappointed after the launch of the F80 recently, I never thought I'd have little to no interest in a flagship Ferrari! Going further I don't think I even care about the new ""holy Trinity"" lineup at all! 👀 They should be exciting or intimidating but instead they come across as soul-less bags of sensors and safety features. 

I needed to be reminded of Ferrari's ability to make timeless design and properly desirable cars. The Ferrari 599 is probably not the first car that comes to mind when you say timeless design but at the same time I don't think any of us would say that this car looks almost 20 years old and there's even fewer that would challenge the desirability of the 599! This was at the Limerick Cars and Coffee in August, let's get to the details. 

This is a Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano (named for its total engine displacement 5,999 cc/6.0 L, Gran Turismo Berlinetta layout, and the Fiorano Circuit test track used by Ferrari) it has a V12 and produces 612bhp. This one is finished in the rarer Rosso Rubino which has a beautiful depth to it and seems like a triple coat candy red, really one to see in the flesh! It's sitting on a lovely set of silver 20'' Monolithic Alloy Wheels. 

Just wanted to share this with you all to remind you of the kind of car Ferrari can build when they haven't been smothered in regulations.

Hello everyone . 

I was unsure if I should write this post or not but I’m going to give it a go . 

I am married . I’m 31 , my husband is 47 . At the start everything was great. We had a great relationship it was a lot of fun . Or I thought so . We got married last year . Leading up to the wedding he pressured me to loose weight , go to gym etc etc . If we  ever spoke about  my work ( I have my own beauty business and have been doing pretty good for the last 8 years ) he will always go into full conversation how I should make more money etc etc . 
Anyways , 3 months into our “ happy “ marriage on day 3 of our honeymoon I have found out he was cheating on me for the last 7 years . My heart was so broken , I won’t go into details , anyone who experienced it will understand . I was very very low . I tried to forgive and forget . I never forgave neither did I forget , and I know I never will . Somewhere deep down I think he is a good person . That’s why I stayed . I stayed because I also didn’t want to hurt him . 
We are now into month 11 after me finding out . He never done therapy , never read books etc . I didn’t see any work he has put in into this except from him saying he loves me more often and telling me I’m
Beautiful more often . 
You’re going to think I’m crazy , but what really pushed me to write this post was today . We are on holidays . First trip
Since out “ amazing “ honeymoon . We were walking down the beach this morning and as we were talking I saw a hermit crab in front of him so I said “ John ! “ ( all excited ) and pointed at the ground . He shouted my name in anger and then gave out to me that I frightened him . All I wanted to do was to show him something pretty and since we both love animals I thought he would enjoy it  . I shouted at him back and told him not to speak to me like this and walked off . He followed me saying let’s not argue and that he got a fright . We eventually stopped at a coffee shop and I let it go . 

 This evening we were going back to our hotel and he knows it breaks my heart if I see stray hungry animals . So I saw little local shop . I went in . He told me not to because he knew what I wanted to do . I didn’t listen . I went in and asked the lady could I please buy a few cans of salmon and tuna . I then asked her for a bowl , she was surprised why and I said I just wanted to feed the kitties and dogs that were around . I then put the food in bowls and shared it across animals and all the locals that were there went “ aaaawww “”” which I was not looking for . What I did was not for me but for pets that were hungry . However It made me feel so nice because I felt these people were on the same page and clearly loved the animals too . My husband however stood there signaling we should go back to hotel. I always thought he was on the same page with me about the animals , we literally spoke today how much I would love to have a go fund me page and feed all these animals and I wouldn’t take a penny ! It would purely be for the animals ! Anyways . We turned to go back to hotel
And the first thing he said to me was : “ what this mother Theresa thing about “ ? 

…. Anyways . I don’t know what else to say . This was just today … and I’m exhausted about these arguments . I think he is a nice person deep down . He does speak of people nicely and cares about his family …. But I don’t know what to think anymore . Am I naive ? Should I thank him for everything and go ? Please tell me what your thoughts are .

I’ve been diving deep into smart ways to save money, and I thought I’d share some strategies that actually make a difference without feeling like a sacrifice. I’m not talking about skipping your daily coffee or living on ramen noodles—these tips are about spending better, not less. Hopefully, these ideas help anyone starting their frugal journey! 🌱

1. Leverage Cashback and Reward Apps - Instead of cutting out shopping altogether, I started using cashback apps and reward programs that stack up points. Over time, it’s amazing how much this saves on essentials.

2. DIY Instead of Buying New - Whether it’s household cleaners or personal care products, making some of these yourself is surprisingly easy and way cheaper. Pinterest is full of recipes that work wonders!

3. Buy Quality Secondhand - I’ve scored some fantastic finds at thrift stores and online marketplaces for a fraction of the price of buying new. From furniture to tech, you’d be surprised at the treasures out there!

4. Batch Cooking and Freezing Meals - This has been a game-changer. Cooking in batches on weekends saves both time and money. Plus, it stops those last-minute takeout temptations.

5. Library Memberships for Free Books, Audiobooks & More - Libraries are a goldmine! Besides books, they often have movies, audiobooks, and even workshops for free or at very low costs.

6. Minimalist Approach to Shopping - Before buying, ask yourself if the item will truly add value. I’ve cut down on impulse buys and saved so much by waiting 24 hours before making any non-essential purchase.

7. Use Tech Tools to Track Expenses - Tracking expenses might sound boring, but apps like Walnut or Spendee help me see where I’m overspending. Over time, this visibility made a huge difference!

8. Set Up a Weekly ‘No Spend Day’ - Every week, I pick one day where I won’t spend a single rupee. It might sound small, but it adds up over time, and it’s a fun challenge too.

9. Embrace DIY for Gifting - Instead of buying gifts, I’ve started making them. It’s cheaper, and people appreciate the personal touch. Handmade gifts have become a hit with friends and family!

10. Invest in Yourself -  This one is more long-term, but learning new skills (even free ones through YouTube or online courses) can open doors to better job opportunities and side gigs.

If you’re into strategies for saving smart and making wise financial moves, I also share practical tips and insights in my newsletter, where I dig into topics like these.

1glptgj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1glptgj,Review: HiBrew G5 Grinder,"I recently picked up the HiBrew G5 grinder for about €110 on AliExpress, thanks to some discount deals. Since I like to switch between regular and decaf beans, single dosing was a priority for me, and this grinder has been a solid fit for that purpose.


Build Quality & Materials


I was pleasantly surprised by the build quality of the G5. Apart from the bean hopper and grind adjustment dial, which are made of plastic, the rest of the grinder is crafted from sturdy aluminum. The metal parts appear to be either painted or anodized with a smooth finish, free from any flaws. Even the small dosing cup has a surprisingly premium feel, held securely in place by magnets on the base—an elegant touch that I really appreciate. It also comes with a small rubber mat for the cup to sit on, but I prefer not to use it, as it makes the setup feel a bit less stable and cheapens the look slightly.


Performance & Grind Consistency


Overall, I find the G5 to be very reliable. I generally grind within a range of 3 to 6 on the dial, which works well for my current, darker roasts. However, this range doesn’t leave much room to go finer, so the G5 might struggle to achieve a fine enough grind for lighter roasts. While I haven’t used high-end grinders like Eureka for comparison, this grinder has performed well enough to keep my shots fairly consistent with medium and darker beans, even after switching varieties.


Retention


The G5 has minimal retention, which I really appreciate—around 0.1g per dose, mainly right after cleaning. For example, after a week of use (about 6 to 8 coffees per day), I captured around 0.7g of retained grounds after cleaning, though there could be closer to 1g in total that didn’t make it into my catch. For a grinder in this price range, I find that very acceptable.


Static & Messiness


One minor downside is that the G5 does have a bit of a static issue, especially when using the hopper. Some grounds tend to scatter around the grinder’s outlet, though the bulk of the grounds still land in the dosing cup. It’s manageable—I just wipe it down with a cloth each time. For the price, I find this slight messiness acceptable.


Design & Usability


I mostly use the grinder in the slightly forward-leaning position, which still allows the beans to feed smoothly and reduces retention. The small hopper on top also seems to keep retention low. It’s a thoughtful design that suits single dosing well. There’s also a feature that allows for slower grinding if you hold down the button longer. Personally, I haven’t noticed any significant change in the grind quality with this feature.


Final Thoughts


All in all, I'm really happy with the HiBrew G5 as an entry-level single-dosing grinder. For the price, it’s a solid choice that meets my needs well and keeps things simple. While it may not be ideal for lighter roasts due to limited grind fineness, it’s more than enough for medium and darker espresso profiles. The minimal retention, manageable static, and solid build make it a very good budget option for home espresso.


I hope my review may help some of you that consider this as a budget friendly grinder.

A friend mentioned to me that the reason coffee and tea were included as forbidden substances in D&C 89 was because “the brethren” were complaining that they had to give up their favorite substances but “the sisters” didn’t have anything they had to sacrifice. At that time the women often gathered for afternoon coffee or tea time. Men disliked that because they would often gossip and they were also worried about word of polygamy spreading during these after tea chats among the women. They wanted to take this away from the women, so coffee and tea were added to the WOW to (1) appease the men who felt the women weren’t sacrificing anything and (2) reduce the ability women had to gather thereby limiting their knowledge of the adultery happening.

Since I(28F) was young I've always cared what people around me thought of me, quick note- Ive never been one to get pressured to ""extreme"" things I dont want to do (like smoke, drugs, clubbing, boy-related things etc.) but its more of polite thing, constantly offering help/things, trying to constantly keep up conversation when I really dont want to.

For example, I will offer someone my last cookie to be nice when I really dont want to, and I want to eat it myself, and when they say yes I get really upset and resentful internally. Or Im currently living with my in laws, and everytime I just go toilet I walk past my MIL in the dining room and I always feel like I have to ask about her day and make convo just to be nice, where I end up stuck in a 30+ minute chat sometimes even though I really just wanted to go pee and go back to the room.  I offer my FIL to make him tea when Im grabbing water or just a spoon or something (something that should take less than a minute) in the kitchen, then he says yes, and Im spending 10-15min longer there now, again in a long convo, when again, I just want to go in and out and be done. (I love my in laws! dont want it to come across as hate, just trying to show the different subtle ways I do this) BTW! I get having respect, and I dont mind helping out and offering things, I just do it waayy too much and esp when I just dont want to, when I first moved in here it was the least I could do -but now 1.5 years later, I just hate myself for it. One time, I had a singular satchet of arabic coffee my mum gave me and I was going to make it, and my MIL was in the kitchen so she asked what it was, and I explained and she said it sounded very nice, and guess what? I OFFERED HER IT AND SHE ACCEPTED, and I ended up in the kitchen for 30 minutes, making my MIL my last coffee sachet and back in my room with nothing for myself - again no one's fault but my own. 

When Im having a conversation with someone, I always feel like I have to carry the weight of the topics, getting the convo going etc. and it really drains me. and my partner keeps telling me, that I dont have to do all that - and I make plans with myself to just walk in the bathroom and out, or to stop offering my things, but I CANNOT HELP IT I END UP STILL DOING IT! I completely get its ""fake"" in a way, and quite bad, but I really cant help it. The other day I showed my SIL a new top I bought and she said it was so nice, I just heard the words ""do you want to have it, I can get myself another one"" come out of my mouth, like ?? whats wrong with me, thankfully she declined. But I am genuinely struggling too much with this. Any genuine tips or advice? thank you!!

When Alec introduced us, I was in a relationship of 5 months with a girl. That fact seemed to have Anna warm up to me and I wouldn't say we were friends but we had fun whenever we hung out.

When my ex and I broke up, she seemed to grow a bit cold with me but it was around the same time she and Alec were going through a rough patch so I thought that was it.

PS: Alec and I have been best friends since diapers and our personalities are so similar, sometimes people mistake us for twins and we see each other as siblings. We never had anything between us. I honestly see the worst parts of my personality in him and that keeps me grounded lol and he feels the same.

When I started dating my bf, she grew colder but what am I gonna do, ask her why and make it an issue? We're not that close and I can brush it off when we all hang out. She's also like that Alec and I's other best friend, Emma and most of the group so I didn't take it too personal.

The issue is that Alec's mom is battling cancer and has been for the past few months. She's like a second mom to me so I've been heavily involved along with my mom, sometimes we clean her house, sometimes we cook, shop, just small things to help as much as we can. I also sometimes go to treatment with her if Alec or her husband can't or are busy taking care of Cat who is 13 (sister/daughter)

Last night, I was with my bf when Alec called him because he was in a dark space and my bf had lost his mom young so he wanted to talk and invited him over. He also told him to call me because he also wanted me there. Anyway, we spent the entire night with him at his apartment, talking until around 4am before all three of us crashed in the living room, my bf and I squeezed in on one couch and Alec on the other. Anna has a key and came in when we were all still asleep with 2 coffees and breakfast to I assume surprise Alec. She was not happy and Istg I woke up thinking who is rapping because she would not take a damn breath between sentences. It took me a second to notice that it's all directed at ME because 'I'm trying to replace her'. I was just blinking a lot - I just woke up but what I gathered is that she hates me, thinks I'm disgusting for being close with Alec's family and doing 'so much to make her look bad' and that she 'sees through my girl best friend act'.

I told her that you couldn't pay me enough to deal with all her issues and that she needs professional help because she sounds certifiable. Alec heard everything and was short circuiting while my bf was still re-acquainting himself with reality. She was still going on but I wasn't sticking around for that and we left.

1glppmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/1glppmg/why_isnt_sertraline_working_as_intended_why_am_i/,"Why isn't Sertraline working as intended? Why am I being potentially misdiagnosed as OCD, anxiety, depression?","I've been taking Sertraline for a few weeks now. It works, but not as intended.

My problem is extreme anxiety and OCD when I am alone. I will drive myself paranoid until I think my neighbours sit at their walls all day and listen to me. As I knew this is not normal behaviour, a difference to schizophrenia etc. (I \*know\* my neighbours aren't stalking me. I know random people don't care about what I do), I went to a psychiatrist. They gave me 50mg Sertraline daily.

Sertraline works. But it fixed things which were never my main issue. I've noticed that I have no problem talking with other people now, it feels like I can talk to other people in person now as if I were texting them, emailing them, which is kind of amazing. I have no fear anymore talking with other people. But it's not like I was unable to talk with people beforehand.

My OCD, anxiety, my ruminating mind did not go away when I am alone. Worse, I feel like it got worse because now I have less fear. I still rearrange my home daily. I buy things and return them. I wipe all my files on my PC and redownload them. I still think that I will be hacked, stackled etc.

My problem is the moment I don't talk with someone \*in person\*, I will go crazy. The moment I go to Subway, talk with the mailman, literally any person, my brain resets and all the ruminating stops. 

I don't know what the problem is. It is horrible. I would love to do \*anything\* that doesn't give me anxiety nonstop. I would love to be a stereotypical Computer Science nerd who sits at home all day infront of their Computer. Instead, my paranoia drives me insane, my anxiety, which leads to non stop ruminating when I sit at home, thinking everyone online will stalk me, hack my accounts, hates me.

I highly think the problem is understimulation. When I am alone, my mind is empty. I have no intrinsic motivation. My brain doesn't think when I am alone. Because I have no intrinsic motivation, no stimulation, my mind fabricates stimulation, seeks out stimulation: E.g. by stress: Handing in assignments at the latest time possible because stress stimulates me. Playing video games all day. Watching movies all day. Masturbating all day. Watching porn all day. Talking with other people all day. Walking around all day because seeing different things stimulates me. Working all day, learning things all day because it stimulates me. I will look at womans asses and tits when I am outside because I will go crazy from understimulation otherwise.

The moment my brain is not stimulated I go crazy. I will focus on anxieties, things no other person would worry about, ever. I also noticed that if I force my last bit of dopamine to give me some motivation and focus on things I would \*like\* doing, the anxieties go away because then, I actually do stuff.

Sertraline addresses Serotonin, maybe how long Dopamine stays. But if there is no Dopamine to begin with, it fails working.

It has gotten worse over the years. I don't have any money anymore. I am suffering because I know \*if my brain was working properly\*, I could do so many great things. Meet new people. Do interesting hobbies. But my brain inhibits me from doing anything because I have no intrinsic motivation. I have no dopamine. Zero.

It has gotten so bad that when I am reading a text on my monitor, it gives me anxiety because there is no stimulation from the static page, so I need to scroll all the time. I can't sit still.

What I also know is that this condition has been since my childhood. Since the very first moment I am able to think my mind is nothing but emptyness. I would sit in my room and feel nothing but emptyness. No inner motivation. None. No motivation to meet friends. No motivation to do anything. 

I suspect a severe case of ADHD. It gets misdiagnosed as depression, anxiety, OCD. But this isn't my \*main\* problem. People tell me that I need to get friends, do hobbies, sports etc. Yes. I know. I know that if I had the slightest amount of internal motivation I would do lots of things. But I don't, so instead I will think about how much money I have, if I will starve this month because I don't have enough money.

There is another problem: My parents don't support me. I depend financially on them, and they don't want to help me with my issues. So I am mentally ill, and I feel pressure to do well in academics from my parents, plus I am mentally abused by them all the time.

I need to get rid of my parents, cut contact, get independent. The problem is my ADHD, or whatever it is, is so strong that I will fail to achieve that goal, and all I am able to think about are nonsensical things all day.

I'm not even suicidal (anymore), nor depressed. I'm just disappointed. Disappointed in my mind. Disappointed that my parents don't support me, instead pressure me. Disappointed that I have to pull myself out of this crap with my nonfunctional mind. Every day I have to fight my mind to work properly just for one second.

I have a next meeting with my psychiatrist soon, I will probably ask for a referral for ADHD diagnosis. I wonder how long that will take though, plus, they will probably want information from my dysfunctional parents like grades when I was in school.

In the meantime, maybe I should drink coke all day to be stimulated. Or coffee. Might actually be a good idea. I envy people who have dopamine.",1,1730983946.0,antidepressants,0,1.0,False

So, couple nights ago i got myself into that situation at the bar, and being a unlucky bastard, here am i entangled into some shady shit, usual deal honestly.   
Went after the *Thin-Bloods*, it took some time to find their place, couple of nights following people,  i suspected they had some sort of relationship with the whole jar thing, eventually found them in a old factory close to the woods,  they were just kids, talented as hell,even professional i would say, but kids, embraced half a decade ago , the older is 20, and i mean, 20 in total, who the hell embrace a 15 year old?   
Well, talked to the Băieți , they were scared, not as much of me as i would enjoy, but of someone else, it took some time and some promises, but  ***Douglas*** opened his mouth, they're the main producers of a lot of the stuff that runs on Copa Cabana's night clubs, in special the Kalabria, they're working under someone, and they're bonded to them, so didn't get much intel on who runs the show, but they said that half the profit goes to the ""***Shadow Man***"" so i had to go to see it for myself.  
  
The Club was noisy, young people and tons of drugs, nothing new under the stars, talked to some people,  there was some kindred there, mostly *Toreador* and Ventrue doing their thing, hanging with their blood-doll babes, i paid some drinks, drank a bit, by that point, honestly i was thinking it would be a cold lead, the runner wasn't there, so i decided to fuck off, go back to the board and think, on my way out i felt it, something off, that cold we feel on the back of our neck, *somebody was watching me*.  
 So i got into my car, checked the trunk, i had enough stuff to set a trap, drove to some further place, a slow drive, gave time to be followed , the bay area has a lot of old werewhouses we could get personal,  if you know what i mean, stoped by the harbor, got into a werehouse and booby traped the place,just some flashbangs and improvised glas-shard bombs, before i finished the work i heard the footsteps and waited, and here comes this bloody bitch with claws , i must say, she was tough, a .12 barely pushed her back, ***Wolf-Girl*** gave me a run for my money, i have avoided using the ***Manturillie*** as frequently as i once did, so the bombs helped a lott, blinding  and slowing her down until i had the chance to put a iron pipe through her chest.

After the fight i loaded her into the trunk of my car, with a extra stake just to make sure, dawn is close, so i stoped by home to get some rest, honestly, why can't people just talk? Says the Ex-Hunter with a sword and a shotgun, i know, just...it was heck of night, damn do i miss Coffee

I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. It will be hard.

My ex asked me for a divorce late 2022. We had been married 10 years together a couple longer than that. I won't go into the details of how we got there. She wasn't happy for a good period of time, and I was in a depressed state (both of us actually hers was longer standing) and things deteriorated more than normal that Fall. She posted a very revealing picture on IG (I didn't have an IG when it was posted) and upon making one and adding her I saw it and blew up late 2022. She was embarrassed and made her feel bad and that paired with things already not being great she asked for a divorce.

I tried talking her out of it, and she eventually decided she would be willing to do a 1 year break living apart and trying to fix things. I kept pushing for us to stay living together and to fix things. Something we both always said we would try and eventually things would roll back to how they were. Set in routines because of where we lived. I asked if we could move and work on things. She didn't want to. I begged. She made it clear it wasn't an option. I historically have been very vocal that I didn't believe in breaks and paired with some other small potential breaks in trust during this month long decision process I said I couldn't do a break... Statistically they don't work and if things were going to end at least if we ended things we could still be on good terms and if things fell apart during a break there's a good chance that wouldn't be possible. She also had decided to move an hour away.

So we decided on separating and divorce.

We have 2 older animals and promised to share them and we would alternate commuting to each other for this purpose. Initially it was more than that. We stayed over with each other and spent time together too. For the first 5-6 months I offered several times to let me pay to break one of our leases to allow us to live together and work it out. She never wanted to take me up on it. After the initial 5-6 months of that I gave up on it and we slowly changed how we did things. No more I love you, at least significantly less frequent. Eventually we stopped staying over and it was just time with the animals and occasionally going to random stores. Down to mostly time with the animals. 

During this she'd bring up trying to work things out and with us both working a lot and it only leaving portions of the weekends and being an hour apart I never thought it was a good idea. And I was trying to heal.

I know this whole scenario was a bad idea time apart was what should have happened from the start but at the time I thought it would keep us on good terms and friends.

Starting in 2024 the time together was an hour or 2 one day a week to sit and have coffee with the animals. She had moved back in with her parents about 20 minutes away to save money.  During one of these she mentioned how doing this is making it hard for her to heal and she didn't understand if we were seeing each other why we weren't trying and why we hadn't done divorce paperwork yet (something that had been brought up a couple times). She said she'd be on vacation in a few weeks and we could do them then.

So after this I printed them out. I did sit on them for a couple of weeks. It's something I knew needed to be done but it was just hard. I started changing how we did the animal time slightly and 2 weeks prior to the proposed time to file I let her know I had printed them so we could do it. She was upset, it was hard for me too.

About a week before filing I met someone and she knew that same week that I had hung out with someone new.

We filed paperwork the week she proposed. I continued to see this person a couple more times that month.

She requested our animals not be around this person which I didn't think was reasonable but I respected it and told her that I'd expect her to take care of them if I needed her to (mostly just on the weekend).

I started dating this person about a month after filing paperwork and continued seeing them every weekend (they lived an hour away). One of the animals developed cancer and with my ex's job being remote she could drive him to get treatment every 2-3 weeks so she would have our animals more often (I wanted them to have equal time between both of us anyway as we were no longer spending time together with them).

All summer she started begging me to get back together with her. It intensified after I started dating this new person. The first scheduled divorce hearing got messed up and pushed back to this month and everything has intensified. Emotions and all. She wants to get back together. Saying I'm picking a new girl over her and making legal threats, threatening to go after the new girls business. I know she was just lashing out and wouldn't do it because she's a good person but I know she's hurt.

She believes I misled her the whole time by spending time with her. I argue I was always clear when she brought up being together that I didn't think we should. We even had multiple conversations about the animal situation whenever we started dating someone over the time separated.

The final divorce hearing is this week and she's mentally not well, and has said hurtful things and just overall hurting and I feel terrible. I know in hindsight we shouldn't have been around each other the whole time but my intentions were to keep us good and to be friends. 

She's threatening to never speak to me again if I go through with the divorce. She says she won't keep the animals away from me but I'll have to find another way to see them without communicating with her. 
She's completely not acting like herself. I'm not saying this to be negative about her it's out of worry.

I just don't know what to do. I thought we were healing and understood where things stood. I didn't hide my seeing someone else when I started. 

I'm looking for advice, or if you've been through anything similar what you did?
I tried to convey both sides in this. I know I'm not blameless. I care about my ex very much and don't want to cause her the pain but am I not supposed to move on? It was almost a year and a half separated before I even started trying to meet new people.

tl;dr -
My ex and I separated to divorce. We spent time together to spend time with our animals and initially spent too much time. Almost a year and a half later we began the divorce process and shortly after I met someone who I started to date a month later. Things got worse between the ex and I. It's the week of the hearing and she is very hurt, and not acting herself and I'm worried and feel terrible but not sure what to do.

Edit: I think typing this out late at night I wasn't very clear in some areas. I'm not asking if I should go back to her. I don't think that would be a good idea. I'm having a hard time seeing her destroyed knowing my actions are the cause. After how long we were together I was hopeful we could be on good terms. It's just some of the things she says to me that get to me. Such as how I'm choosing a girl I've known for 5 minutes over 13 years etc. I don't see it as that from my POV we were ended. If I had actively been trying to fix things with her and then started dating if understand. Anyways just wanted to clarify",5,1730983528.0,relationship_advice,37,0.59,False

I'm looking for advice on how to have a difficult conversation with a friend. I'm 28F, she's 50+ F.

Lately, I haven't felt like hanging out with her anymore. I feel uncomfortable around her. I don't invite her to hang out with me because I don't enjoy her company anymore. 

In multiple occasions, she has made some negative comments about my body (for example, ""Are you sure you're okay? You've lost weight"". Mind you, I'm a gym girl, I weightlift 4x a week, been doing it for 4+ years). 

Once, we went out eating, and she treated the hospitality staff impolitely, something that I personally cannot stand.

According to her, I should always get her a coffee/drink/anything, because we are ""friends"", and that's what friends do. Everytime we hang out, I feel obligated to buy her a drink, otherwise she would label me as ""selfish"", or ""individualistic"". 

The last time we met (a few days ago), I really felt uncomfortable. She kept on telling me that I should have more sex, to ""give my pu**y away more often"". 

I'm looking for a serious relationship, I'm not interested in hooking up around with total strangers. It's also very unsafe.

She's very interested in knowing details about my sexual life with other men. I keep these type of details very private, what happens between me and a man is nobody's business.

I'm not having fun with her anymore. How do I communicate this to her? I don't want to ghost her. ",2,1730983407.0,FriendshipAdvice,5,1.0,False
1glpjm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditHorrorStories/comments/1glpjm1/market/,Market,"I still remember that Saturday morning like it just happened. It was supposed to be a quick trip to the farmer’s market, nothing out of the ordinary. I was meeting my friend Nate to grab some fresh produce and catch up. The sun was just starting to warm up the cool morning air, and the smell of coffee and baked bread floated around like it was leading everyone by the nose.

As I was browsing the tomatoes, an older man—probably in his 70s with a shock of white hair and a sturdy posture—walked up and asked me, “Do you know if these are better than the ones down on 3rd Street?” Before I could answer, he chuckled, “I suppose I’m not giving you much of a choice, am I? Sorry, old habits.” We ended up talking for a good 10 minutes, mostly about the weather, the market’s history, and how his late wife used to drag him out to markets like this every weekend.

When he noticed Nate walking over, he nodded at me and said, “Well, I won’t keep you. Thanks for humoring an old man’s stories.” He turned and slowly walked away, blending into the crowd like he’d never been there at all.

I turned to Nate, who had been watching the whole time with an amused look. “Making friends?” he teased, nudging me in the ribs. I shrugged it off and changed the topic to avoid getting all sentimental in the middle of a bustling market.

The strange part? The next weekend, I decided to visit the market again, half-expecting to see the old man in his usual spot. But after chatting with one of the vendors who’d been there for years, I found out there was no regular visitor matching his description.

We stayed well under budget and I'll post the breakdown elsewhere. I'm thinking I should sell these leftovers and would appreciate advice. 

The stuff: 

**Mason jar mugs with bamboo lids and metal straws (33)**

I had ordered these for drinks and party favors before realizing that having glass on our pool deck was a bad idea. We washed and put out a handful in the house for the coffee bar, but only a couple were used and 3/36 were taken; 24 are still untouched in the original boxes.

  
**White metal insulated stemless wine glass-shaped drink holders (11)**

Like those Yeti-style cups with lids--shaped like stemless wineglasses. Bought to replace glass mugs (above). These were a hit. We put stickers on them to match the theme and guests used them for both mimosas and other drinks. Lots of guests took them as party favors. We have 7 that I washed and put out but were not used and 4 still in boxes. 

**Back-up wedding dress (L)**

There was an excellent possibility that the planned dress would not be altered in time, so we had [this one on-hand just in case](https://poshmark.com/listing/LULUS-S-Lovingly-Yours-White-Mesh-Long-Sleeve-Bridal-Maxi-Dress-L-672b6ee19b37c7bd0e204df8). Got it on Poshmark and have listed it for resale, but I don't know if that's the best move. It was a cheapy, but surprisingly good looking and not at all scratchy. Some of my Poshmark purchases have been, um, not clean, but this one was either cleaned professionally or never worn. 

**Back-up bridesmaid's dress (XL)**

Similar situation to above but got this one from The RealReal: Jenny Yoo (Anthropologie brand) sand-colored, full-length dress with A-line skirt, square neckline with flutter sleeves. Simple cuts for both dresses were so that I could manage alterations with my non-expert sewing skills. TRR no longer accepts the brand, so I can't return or resell it with them.

Day 1 is day one, it was harder than it should be because on Day 0 I ate sugar, I always like to start a fast after a day of no sugar, no carbs.

Day 2 is always harder than Day 1.  Got to Ketosis is 40 hours.  Heighten sense of smell, hearing, can't sit still (ADAH) gets worse, I notice my mental capacity is done 5%-10%.  Fasting Salts and Tylenol seem to help with my problem solving.  My on again, off again Tinnitus starts full time when fasting.  Lots and Lots of Water.

Day 3 is easy street.  Nasty taste in my mouth all the time, using mouth wash and not swallowing.  No BM.  Lots of energy

Today is Day 4.  I have done this before; I lose a pound a day when fasting and my bump back is a little over a pound.  I don't bother to weigh myself anymore when doing this.

I will go as long as I can, however I have a hard stop on Sunday (my wife's birthday) and I am taking her out to dinner.  I will probably eat a meal before that, I always stop with eggs and attempt to go full Keto diet.

If you're like me, always on the hunt for the next perfect coffee spot, you probably end up finding recommendations in blogs, Instagram posts, or YouTube reviews. But keeping track of all these cozy spots was giving me a serious case of bookmark overload.

That's why I came up with Locator—an app designed to save and organize all those café recommendations you find online effortlessly. Say you stumble upon an article highlighting the must-visit cafés in Paris. Instead of manually adding each location to your maps or saving the article link, you can share it with Locator, and it saves all those charming spots as geopoints.

Now, all your caffeine-fueled discoveries are stored in one tidy spot, ready for whenever you need them. If getting all your café finds organized sounds like your cup of tea (or coffee), check it out.

The guitar itself is fantastic. I am new to 7 strings, and so was not sure totally what to expect but the thin neck profile and lo pro bridge feels great to use. 

I also absolutely love the second position with single coil engaged which sounds amazing clean with Nolly X.

I currently drink mostly pourover coffee but I have a flair Neo that I use occasionally but it’s pretty tedious. I use a fellow opus grinder that works fine for espresso. I am going to get a breville bambino soon and the first thing I’m gonna upgrade is the portafilter. The stock one seems cheap, has plastic in it and looks pretty stupid I think. I’m not sure if I want to get a bottomless portafilter though because of the mess. I don’t feel like cleaning up espresso sprays at 6 am. When I used the bottomless one on my flair I didn’t have many channeling or spraying until I dented the basket and had to put the spout on to stop the spraying.

I know this is a safe space so please help me or give me some advice because I really don't know what to do. I am about to take a civil engineering board exam in less than 2 weeks, this is already my 2nd take but for the past few months, I was never really productive. I don't know if it was because I was disappointed in myself to the point that I lost motivation to study already, but God knows how much I wanted to pass this exam. For the past few months, I only tried to look for a coping mechanism that would make me happy or to shift my emotions, it actually worked, however, there are times that I can't really help myself to stop overthinking. Parang pakiramdam ko na lang palagi merong masamang mangyayari or whatever, parang puno na ng negative thoughts yung utak ko. Minsan gusto kong lumabas, para mawala sya sa isip ko pero may mga oras na ayoko rin lumabas kasi pakiramdam ko meron na namang masamang mangyayari. One time, preboard sa review center namin, isang oras lang naging tulog ko, idk pero suddenly pagkagising ko sobrang lakas ng tibok ng puso ko and parang hindi ako makahinga to the point na bigla na lang pumasok sa isip ko na ""ayaw ko pa mamatay"" which is weird kasi first time ko lang syang naramdaman ever in my life. After that day, naramdaman ko sya ulit habang nasa simbahan, then after that, pinakamalala ko syang naramdaman nung isang beses na bago ako matulog, bigla ko na naman naisip na ""pano kung pagpikit ko hindi na ako magising?"". Like, naramdaman ko non na papatulog na ako pero bigla na lang kusang gumigising yung sarili ko para ipaalala yung thought na yon and it was so hard because I am so drained at antok na antok na ako that time pero hindi ko magawang makatulog natatakot akong baka hindi ako magising. Naiisip ko pa non na pano na lang yung pamilya at mga kaibigan ko. Like should I tell my friends to contact my family if hindi man ako bigla magparamdam? ksksjdhjdksa and now sorry I just need to let this out sobrang lala ng pag ooverthink ko talaga to the point na hindi ako makapag-aral ng maayos. I'm really trying to control myself and to control my thoughts pero hindi ko talaga kaya. Sobrang lala nya na coz even right now that I'm planning to attend a specific concert for next year parang bigla akong nag-aalangan kasi naiisip ko kagad na pano kung pumunta ako don tapos may di magandang mangyari during con or pag-uwi ko? I am also someone na living near the airport, and everytime na may dumadaan na eroplano sobrang nagpapanic ako sa tunog na I need to stop everything that I'm doing so I can hear it properly (for background, I think this was because of the airplane crash issue back then if you guys are aware about it back in 2011? -- we're living near that area). Idk, please alam ko sobrang random pero I swear these thoughts that are running on my mind is not really helping me. Inooverthink at nagpapanic ako sa maraming bagay. I'm really trying my best to study pero once these thoughts came into my head, wala na akong nagagawa. I tried studying sa coffee shop kanina pero di rin ako nagtagal coz it's still the same. Ewan sorry baka sobrang random ko pero please do u have any advice so I can atleast lessen this feeling? hshshahaha mahal magpacheck xD THANK U SO MUCH, I WILL REALLY APPRECIATE IT IF U REPLY SALAMAT PO :)

1glp4r1,https://i.redd.it/27w62oh82hzd1.jpeg,Mixed Attars Haul,"Realised lately I hadn’t been showing attars the love they deserve. Had been a while since I got them last. So courtesy of u/LegendaryFalcon ‘s superb guidance & advice finally got all of these. Sharing a brief description & review of them. Got them namely from 3 different houses:-

1. Aafiya

2. Jashan Fragrances

3. Attar World Sonar Bangla

Not coming to the attars themselves

1. Aafiya Calligraphie Vetiver - not particularly heavy on the vetiver as the name suggests. It’s a very spicy & woody oil with a breath of freshness coming in once in a while. The vetiver is somewhat there in the mid but I do not get any otherwise. It’s majorly spices & tobacco throughout with that cedarwood drydown. Amazing performance. 8/10.

2. Aafiya Amber Muattaq - this was very hyped recently & I thought I should try it. I was not disappointed but not particularly impressed either. It’s an amber heavy attar with a caramel & almost molasses like opening. Would remind you of a good dark rum. Then it has musk, rose & certain baking spices as well in the drydown. No complaints regarding performance though. 6.5/10.

3. Jashan Orange Musk 103 - this is absolutely amazing stuff. It’s photorealistic creamy orange. In different stages it smells like different orange flavoured goodies from our childhood, for example the hard orange candy, the orange cream biscuits, orange candy ice cream etc. According to Piyush bhai this is 88% natural. As a result the performance is not great also it cannot be worn in sunlight as it is photosensitive. But worth picking up for the quality & experience. 9/10.

4. Jashan Vetiver D’Abord - Khus, kewda, citrus, spices. These are what I get. Think of an old school majmua made much more fresher, wearable & modern. Absolutely a banger if you like that genre of fragrances. Very calming & cooling. 8.5/10.

5. Jashan Uganda Coffee - Again a photorealistic creation from Piyush bhai. Think of the darkest roasted coffee beans you can imagine (think french roast or vinenna roast). This is exactly that, bitter coffee,some chocolate, jaggery & stuff that you expect to find in a dark roast. Not sweet at all and that is the best part about it. If you’re looking to upgrade from the synthetic mess that al rehab french coffee is this one of the best options out there. 8.5/10.

6. Jashan Honey Oud - this a fresh, citrusy & quite a camphorous & powdery concoction. No oud despite the name. Has a very pious nature & aura. Reminds of a South Indian Temple. A good overall blend. 7.5/10

7. AWSB Oud Tabac - Well first of all with this house both me & u/LegendaryFalcon have observed that the oud is not at all prominent despite having in the name. This is the case with all three of these. However I am gonna judge it on the fragrance alone & not any other parameters.

Oud Tabac is majorly a medicinal tobacco oil with some spices in the background. Absolutely wonderful & a must try for tobacco fragrance lovers. This is probably the most natural & neutral form you can experience it in. 9.5/10.

8. AWSB Oud Bahadur - this according to Mr. Sangat has natural musk oil & natural castoreum blended in it. As a result can have an ammonia like smell in the late stages of the drydown. But I personally don’t get anything revolting from it. They are blended very well & is quite a unique creation. 8/10.

9. AWSB Oud Wajid - this is a nakh choya based blend, with some other facets like a slight spices & patchouli which I had. Has that overtly marine nature bordering on fishy due to the nakh choya. However it is more wearable than the nakh choya sandali from SMAMY due to some other facets blended into it. Not for everyone & extremely limited occasions where you can wear it. But as a blend overall quite good. 7.5/10.",4,1730982017.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,12,0.67,False

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

**Citizen states:  ""The stoplight at Avenue of champions turning left onto MLK the arrow never changes to green. I sat through four lights to try to turn. finally I just sat under it and turned l left to MLK It goes to yellow, but there’s so much traffic yo**
you can’t get through.""
NOTE:  Traffic Engineering staff went to the site on Wednesday 11/6 at approximately 11:50 am, and verified the condition.  With higher traffic volumes (such as when UK is in session), a motorist must safely enter the intersection while the light is flashing yellow, and then complete the left turn and clear the intersection after the signal has turned red, which is legal in Kentucky.
Traffic Engineering will consider adding a protected left turn during times of higher traffic volumes.

She instantly said she needed a place to stay the following weekend because she had a party to attend. My boyfriend was coming over but I told her yes, because it would seem quite bad to offer and then say no right after. She said she would be arriving on friday at the end of the afternoon, so I stayed home to wait for her. at 4pm she said she was arriving. 5pm rolled around, then 6, then 7... And I hit her up like what's going on? 

She said she was keeping a friend company until someone picked her up. I thought that was a little disrespectful, like I you tell me you're arriving to the city and I stay home waiting for you and then I end up being at the mercy of someone else?... But whatever. She ended up arriving at 9PM and she asked if she could bring a friend for dinner and that they would get their own dinner so I said sure. 

They had dinner and she invited me to go out but I was so tired I ended up refusing. 

She came back at 4am and then asked to eat my last bagel - mind you, bagels aren't exactly cheap and she passed places that were open and had food. 

 She didn't bring any food and didn't offer to pay for anything whatsoever so whatever she ate was stuff that I had bought for myself for the week. I didn't exactly have an empty pantry but I expected her to at least bring something to contribute since she was going to eat, sleep and shower at my place.

After we had lunch I was on my pc for the afternoon while she got ready and she proceeded to tell me that she didn't know how I could stand being ""unproductive"" and that she needed to ""at least go out and have a coffee"" during the day. Mind you, she slept in and by the time she woke up I had already gone to the gym, taken a shower, put clothes in the washing machine and put clothes out to dry. I was also the one who made us lunch. 

That day she had the party and when I woke up she wasn't home and I had a text saying she wasnt coming back to sleep over, she was coming back later in the afternoon - which she did, to wait for the person that was giving her a lift. 

I kind of feel like she used my house as a hotel, or that she tried to leech off of me... I think it would have at least been thoughtful to bring food or snacks as a thank you or as a contribution.

I haven't put them up yet, but I have white curtains with some geometric design on them, so I'm thinking a white elegant rug to go with it (but I'm open to suggestions). I'm planning on putting some printed pictures from my travels above the couch. But yeah - I don't know what to do about the TV stand. I've attached a picture of the old one I ordered online which looked nice but is actually disgusting so I'd be returning it.
