1kgs36q,https://i.redd.it/ihm51471jbze1.png,Don’t Trust HR. My Performance Review Nearly Killed Me.,"It began like any other weekday morning in Bengaluru. I had just logged in when the HR mail landed in my inbox:

**""Your Annual Appraisal is scheduled. Please report to Conference Room 3, Whitefield Campus, at 8:00 AM tomorrow for Calibration.""**

*Calibration*. The word sounded strangely scientific. Cold. And… promising.

This wasn’t just a regular review—it was *the* review. The one that could push me from a lowly Data Analyst into a managerial role in the Ops team. And I wanted that title. Badly.

After all, I’d spent the past year buried in Excel macros, Tableau dashboards, and SQL scripts that made my eyes burn. But Operations—that was where the real impact happened. And my boss was already a Senior Ops Manager. If I could just impress him…

At 6:05 PM, just as I was about to shut down, he appeared beside my cubicle with his signature chai cup in hand. He smiled, the kind that was equal parts encouragement and warning.

""Big day tomorrow, haan?"" he said, patting my back. His right leg dragged slightly—a limp he said he got on a Himalayan trek gone wrong. Lost part of his foot, but gained leadership wisdom, apparently.

""Don’t let me down, Arjun. They're watching.""

I nodded nervously, noticing again the *black corporate lanyard* around his neck. Unlike our junior blue tags, the black badges gave access to restricted floors and secret projects. I craved one like a thirsty man craves water.

The next morning, I arrived at Whitefield Campus early. Conference Room 3 wasn’t even in the main building. It was in an isolated block across the road—near that half-constructed tech park where dogs roamed and no Uber driver wanted to wait too long.

I realized, not for the first time, that even after two years at Qonverge Solutions Pvt Ltd, I still didn’t quite know what we *did*. Some said cybersecurity. Others mentioned defense analytics for the Indian government. Most of our files were labelled *Confidential*. Even our org chart was blurred out beyond level 3.

A security guard opened the main gate, and I entered the HR building. A stark waiting area greeted me, with a giant ‘HR & TALENT ACQUISITION’ sign above. A grim-looking receptionist motioned for me to sit.

Three others were already there.

First was Priya from IT—always helpful, with a bindi and a warm smile. She waved nervously at me.

Next was Mr. Menon, a senior accountant. I’d seen him smoking Gold Flake lights in the parking lot, muttering about TDS.

The third person I barely recognized—maybe from the product team. Slightly geeky, specs, formal shirt neatly tucked. Probably a software engineer.

Were we all here for the same promotion?

Before I could ask, the receptionist stood and gestured toward a door without a word. We followed her through narrow corridors, lit poorly with flickering tube lights, until we reached a heavy wooden door. She opened it just enough for us to step inside.

*Thud.* The door slammed behind us.

The room inside was massive. Empty except for a steel structure in the center, ringed with panels and terminals. Overhead, blinding lights and half a dozen CCTV cameras hummed silently. At one end, a large tinted glass wall.

Behind it, I saw them—our managers, our department heads. Including *my boss*. All seated like judges, sipping Bru filter coffee and watching us.

He got up, approached a terminal near the glass, and swiped his *black badge*. Picking up a mic, he began:

""This is the Annual Appraisal and Calibration Exercise for promotion to Regional Ops Manager. Please step onto the white circles marked on the floor. The review begins now.""

We obeyed. Our screens came alive.

**Phase 1: Screening.**  
""Please fill the form honestly. Any falsehood will result in immediate disqualification.""

The questions were straightforward at first.  
*""Are you married?""*  
*""Can you code in Python?""*  
*""Have you ever violated the company’s internal data policy?""*

I answered everything carefully. Priya was sweating beside me. Mr. Menon, stoic. The engineer seemed calm.

After 10 minutes, my boss returned to the mic.

""Candidate Raghav, eliminated for lying.""

The engineer barely had time to react before a *phutt!* sound echoed, and he crumpled to the floor—smoke rising from his forehead. The hole in the panel had a weapon inside.

Priya screamed.

""Do not step off your circle,"" my boss warned. ""There’s a gun aimed at each of you. Candidate Raghav failed the integrity check. The system verified a lie. Zero tolerance.""

My stomach churned. Mr. Menon closed his eyes and muttered a silent *Om Namah Shivaya*.

**Phase 2: Company Gyaan**

Ten rapid-fire questions on Qonverge's history, values, and goals. True or False.

""Integrity is one of our five values."" – *True.*

""Our top client is the Indian Air Force."" – *True.*

""Our CEO is a former IAS officer."" – *False. (He was ex-DRDO.)*

We all helped each other. Whispered guesses. Recalled offsite speeches and blurred slides from townhalls.

By question nine, all three of us had perfect scores.

Then came question ten:  
*""Our YoY growth last year was 14%.""*

Mr. Menon immediately said, ""True."" Priya followed suit.

I hesitated. 14%? That didn’t seem right. I remembered a revenue report with a 9.1% growth—sent late at night from finance.

I tapped *False*.

Silence.

""Candidate Priya is eliminated.""

She looked at me with panic, understanding the betrayal a second too late—then collapsed like the others.

Rage simmered in my chest. ""You made her trust you,"" I snarled at Mr. Menon.

He didn’t flinch. ""Only one can lead.""

My boss cleared his throat. ""Final Phase: *Iccha Shakti* – The Test of True Will.""

The panels opened. Inside each was a traditional Indian *agni kund*—a small fire pit with glowing embers and a pair of steel tongs.

""To prove your will,"" he announced, ""you will pick up the tongs, take the burning *koi noor* chip embedded in the embers, and place it in the bowl next to you—without dropping it. This chip powers our national encryption systems. Handling it tests both your endurance and nerve.""

Mr. Menon stepped forward. His hands didn’t even tremble. He gripped the tongs, pulled the red-hot chip out, and dropped it perfectly.

I followed.

The heat singed my skin. I screamed inwardly but didn’t let go. I placed it in the bowl.

""Congratulations,"" came the voice through the speaker. ""Mr. Menon, your time was slower. Candidate Arjun is now the Regional Operations Manager.""

A loud *pop*.

Mr. Menon collapsed. Bullet to the back of his skull.

It’s been six months.

I sit now in the glass-walled office on the top floor. Black badge around my neck. Same limp. Same smile.

Every time I walk past HR, I hear whispers of new Calibration rounds. And I wonder—

Was I promoted because I was the best?

Or because I was the last one standing?",1,1746605560.0,Indian_horror,0,1.0,False

A bright, white smile is what we all wish for, and it's not surprising that tooth whitening has been so trendy in recent years. To enhance one's appearance, for a wedding, or just to be more confident, tooth whitening can be life-changing. However, with any cosmetic procedure, there are plenty of questions and misconceptions. At Dr Anne's Aesthetics Dental Clinic in Bangalore, we're dedicated to providing our patients with honest, easy-to-understand information so they can make the best possible decisions for their smile. So let's take a look at what you need to know about dental bleaching and whether it's for you.

**What Is Dental Bleaching, and How Does It Work?**

[Dental bleaching](https://anneaestheticsdental.com/) is a procedure that lightens your teeth. It's done with safe, professional-strength whitening gels such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. These gels dissolve stains and discoloration in your enamel, making your smile whiter. Professional treatment is unlike whitening strips or gels found at the drugstore because they give more reliable results and are closely monitored by a cosmetic dentist to protect you.

We have two main kinds of whitening procedures at Dr Anne's Aesthetics Dental Clinic:

**In-office whitening:** This is performed in the office, typically within an hour, and you'll have the results right away.

**Home whitening kits:** Pre-fitted trays and strong whitening gel are sent to be used in the comfort of your home. These do take slightly longer but could be more convenient and cheaper.

Whatever you choose, professional whitening is a great way of achieving a noticeably whiter smile, and your cosmetic dentist will be able to recommend the best course of action for you.

**The Importance of Healthy Teeth Before Whitening**

Before you set off to bleach, you have to ensure that your teeth are healthy. Have plaque removed and general dental cleaning first. Whitening is best done on clean teeth, and so a professional clean to dislodge any tartar and plaque deposits is generally recommended prior to treatment.

Your dentist will also be checking for other problems, such as cavities or gum disease. Whitening products can make teeth sensitive if the teeth have been compromised in the past, so anything that has to be fixed has to be fixed first. Lastly, teeth whitening accomplishes nothing with dental fillings or crowns, so your dentist will ensure you understand what you can and can't do before you proceed.

At Dr Anne's Aesthetics Dental Clinic, we practice a complete oral care philosophy. This guarantees that the teeth whitening treatment is both safe and successful, providing you with the type of results you want without compromising your dental health.

**What Occurs During a Whitening Treatment**

When teeth are whitened, the procedure is simple but still leaves most people wondering what exactly happens. This is a short summary of what to expect from a professional procedure:

**First Consultation:**

Before any whitening treatment, your cosmetic dentist will have a proper evaluation of your teeth. This includes checking your teeth's current color, your expectations, and that your dental health is in the best possible condition.

**Preparation:**

Next, your dentist will apply a rubber shield or a gel to your gums which will shield them from the bleaching agents. It is done because it will keep everything except your teeth away from the bleaching solution.

**Whitening Treatment:**

The whitening substance is then applied to your teeth. Depending on the procedure, a specific light or laser is applied to the agent to start it and hasten the process. You may need to sit for a series of 15-minute sessions as the agent works. In-office procedures last approximately one hour and can whiten your teeth several shades.

**Post-Treatment Care:** Eventually, your dentist will talk to you about aftercare, which will generally mean that you don't eat or drink particular foods and drinks (such as coffee or wine) for some period of time. A little tooth sensitivity is also normal, but it will usually disappear in a few hours or days.

The good news? Most people notice visible results from one visit. Although the whitening is not permanent (particularly if you keep drinking coffee or smoking), home care or touch-ups will maintain your smile for longer.

**Defeating Some Popular Misconceptions About Tooth Bleaching**

There is a lot of disinformation about whitening, and many people have heard some of the myths about whitening that intimidate them. Let's dispel some of the most common ones:

**""Teeth whitening damages enamel.""**

This is a myth. Bleaching teeth at the dentist is safe and won't hurt your enamel if you go to a trained cosmetic dentist. Professional bleaching is really done very carefully so that it won't hurt your enamel.

**""Everybody is whitened equally well.""**

The bad news is that this is not the case. Some people naturally have more responsive teeth to whitening agents than others. For instance, yellow teeth are more responsive than gray or brown teeth. If your teeth are not as white as you would like them to be, your dentist will have some solutions to present to you, like veneers, to make them look the way you want them to.

""After whitening my teeth, they will stay white forever."" As great as we might wish to believe that's correct, it is not. Teeth whitening is a cosmetic process that whitens your teeth on a temporary basis. Some lifestyle habits such as consuming coffee, tea, or wine, or smoking, tend to darken your teeth over the years. Follow-up treatments will maintain your shining smile, but you will have to take care of your achievement with good dental hygiene. ""Teeth whitening solutions available over-the-counter are equally effective as clinical treatments."" Although whitening products available in drugstores can create an immediate whitening effect, they are weaker and less effective than professional treatments. The over-the-counter bleaching products are weaker, and the treatment is not formulated to meet your individual dental needs. Professional whitening provides better results with less risk of sensitivity or damage. 

**Final Thought**

Leave Your Smile with the Professionals Teeth whitening is a personal choice, and you can rely on the professionals who will guide you through the treatment. At[ Dr Anne's Aesthetics Dental Clinic,](https://anneaestheticsdental.com/) we listen to your personal requirements and come up with a plan that is tailored exactly for you. If you wish to whiten your teeth for a wedding, party night out, or simply because you'd love to feel more confident, we will be with you every step of the way to deliver the best. If you're ready to get started and soak up the warmth of a brighter smile, we'd be delighted to have you at our clinic.

We’ve been talking consistently for two years since then and occasionally go out for coffee to chat.

To begin with, I’ve been in touch with my old professor from college for nearly three years, and she’s made me a better person. She’s helped me navigate issues related to school, family, and my upbringing. It’s been two years since I took her class, and I’ve unexpectedly developed feelings for her. Both of us are single. The hardest part is that I don’t want to pursue her. I value our friendship deeply and care about her a lot. However, I can’t help but feel a strong attraction and desire for more. I’m almost convincing myself there’s a chance with her, even though I know deep down there isn’t. I’m not emotionally mature for her, and she probably sees me like a little brother. I’m unsure what to do at this point.

I think these feelings started after I opened up about my family and early childhood trauma. She did the same and shares her struggles with me. I love her and care about her, and I believe she loves and cares about me too, as she always looks out for my best interests in my goals, relationships, and more. This has become so intense that my heart literally skips a beat when I receive a message from her. She’s been the only source of joy in my life these past few years, and it’s frustrating to feel this way because I don’t want to lose her. 

Edit: she occasionally seeks validation from about her looks. For instance: she was telling me how she doesn’t think she’s pretty anymore to which I told her she was. She also told me she gets dressed up (wears makeup for me which she normally doesn’t) for when we go out together. 

I am now 23M and she is 45F.  What would you guys do in this situation? Would you cut her off (I’ve thought about this but I don’t want to lose her)? Would you be honest with her and confess your feelings? Would you try to get some separation (I’ve sort of tried this but always cave and message her)? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

1kgrxah,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/1kgrxah/i_used_to_think_panic_attacks_were_just_in_my/,I used to think panic attacks were just in my head - then I collapsed at work”,"Three years ago, I hit send on an email, stood up from my desk, and completely blacked out. No warning, no buildup - just pure burnout crashing into my body like a truck. I woke up in the office sick room, my heart racing, head spinning, drenched in sweat. I was 32, working as an IT director, handling a dozen projects, 3 execs breathing down my neck, and a team that relied on me for every single ticket. I’d been grinding since helpdesk days. I thought stress was just part of the game. I told myself I was fine. I was *so* wrong.

What no one tells you is how *normalized* anxiety becomes in tech. You’re praised for “powering through,” glorified for skipping vacations, and lowkey shamed for saying no. I was the ‘fixer.’ I said yes to everything. I answered 2AM emails. I was everyone’s emergency contact. I thought that made me irreplaceable. Reality? I was on the edge of a breakdown, and no one-including me-saw it coming.

That was my wake-up call. I started reading everything I could on stress, trauma, work psychology, and panic disorder. I enrolled in a psychology Master’s part-time. I tried to make sense of the system that almost broke me-and why so many of us stay stuck in it.

Here’s what actually helped me heal (and no, it’s not “just take a walk”):

7 brutally honest lessons that helped me manage anxiety attacks:

* If your chest feels tight and your thoughts are spiraling, *lie down flat*\-it regulates blood flow and helps your nervous system recalibrate.  
* Stop calling it “just stress.” It’s not. Chronic stress reshapes your brain. Ignoring it won’t make it noble-it’ll make you sick.  
* Your nervous system needs rhythm: try bilateral movement like walking or tapping your knees alternately-sounds silly but it literally rewires your anxiety response.  
* The moment you feel a panic wave, *hold ice cubes* in both hands-it’s a shock trick to pull your brain out of the spiral.  
* If you’ve been crying at work (or hiding in bathroom stalls), that’s not weakness-it’s your body *begging* you to listen.  
* You don’t need to quit today, but you *do* need a plan. Having even a rough timeline helps your brain exit survival mode.  
* Say this out loud: “I’m not lazy. I’m in survival mode.” Repeating it rewires guilt into self-compassion.  

People always ask what books or tools helped me most-here’s my starter pack if you’re burnt out, anxious, or one coffee away from a breakdown:

3 books that saved me (and might just change your life):

*The Body Keeps the Score* by Bessel van der Kolk NYT bestseller & trauma classic-explains how trauma lives in the body, not just the brain. You’ll *finally* understand your stress responses. Honestly? Best book I’ve ever read on healing.

*Burnout* by Emily & Amelia Nagoski This book will make you question everything you think you know about “pushing through.” Groundbreaking, funny, and deeply validating. A must-read for anyone who feels fried.

*Lost Connections* by Johann Hari This isn’t just about depression-it’s about the societal lies we believe about success, productivity, and isolation. Hari’s storytelling hit me like a freight train.  


3 apps/websites/podcasts that keep me grounded (and growing):

1. *The Huberman Lab Podcast* Neuroscience made practical. Dr. Andrew Huberman breaks down anxiety, sleep, and dopamine like a badass nerdy uncle. I listen during morning walks-it’s therapy meets TED Talk.  
2. *BeFreed (smart reading app)* My friend at a big consulting firm in NYC recommended this. You can read or *listen* to 10-min flashcards, 40-min deep dives, or fun storytelling versions of nonfiction. It’s designed for people with no time and lots of anxiety (aka me). I was skeptical until I tried it with a book I knew. Covered almost everything. Lifesaver when I couldn’t concentrate long enough to read a full book.  
3. *Insight Timer (meditation app)* Free, massive library, and not weirdly spiritual unless you want it to be. My go-to for anxiety SOS moments or winding down before bed.  

If you’re reading this and nodding through the tears or clenched jaw-please know you’re not alone. I promise it doesn’t have to stay like this. There *is* a way out. Not overnight, but step by step. Pick *one* thing from this post and try it today. And for the love of your nervous system, please take that damn PTO.

You weren’t born just to survive your job. You were born to *feel* alive.

Let’s talk. What helped *you* get out of burnout mode? Or if you’re still in it, drop your story-I’ll reply. We heal better when we don’t do it alone. 🫂",1,1746604855.0,office,0,1.0,False

This week at work. I was surprised how much of work I could get done and my energy levels were uncomparable to the days with caffeine. I was doing task after task, I could focus on my work. I did not procrastinate one bit, no interest in scrolling social media whatsoever. 

But then... Today. I decided to drink a tiny amount of coffee. That's wild. Its now 10 AM I have done nothing and I have no motivation do to anything whatsoever.

Some days I realise I haven’t touched “normal” clothes in a while, especially if I’m moving around the city a lot.

But I also find myself second-guessing it: is this too casual? Do I look like I gave up? I love the ease and comfort, but I sometimes wish it felt a bit more polished — or that it was more *socially acceptable* to wear something technically sporty and still feel well-dressed.

I’m curious if anyone else is leaning into activewear more in everyday life — especially in London where the pace is high, and plans are unpredictable. Is it convenience, comfort, style — or just the default at this point?

But this time, I really am taking it one day at a time. Each day, my main mission is to get to bed in good shape and if that's literally all I do, that's a win. 

Today, now that my first mug of coffee has kicked in, I'm feeling like a bit of a warrior! However, I'm not going to get ahead of myself. So I'm going to be gentle with myself where I need to and mindful of my thoughts. 

I'm going to get to a meeting too. Just to get a check in with some sober peeps.

Everybody in their social circle knew Eleanor Donovan had it bad for Chris Langford. Like, hopelessly in love.

So when folks saw Chris walk into the VIP room all cozy with some new girl, someone muttered, ""Dude, Eleanor is coming tonight. You really couldn't tone it down a bit?""

Chris just shrugged like he couldn't care less. ""Why should I? If she can't take it, she can just fuck off.""

""Do you even like her?""

Chris scoffed. ""If she weren't uncle Tyler's little leverage, you think I'd be dating her? Agreeing to marry her was just a temporary move. That's all she'll get—my last name. Anything else? She can keep dreaming.""

""Don't talk like that, all right? What if she hears that and dumps you?""

""You think she has that kind of spine? Please."" Chris gave a lazy sneer. ""She has been learning massage lately—her hands are not half bad. Maybe I should have her give you all a turn.""

""Come on, man."" One of them chuckled. ""That's crazy.""

Another guy laughed. ""Nah, you are missing the point. If Chris even hints at breaking up, Eleanor folds like a lawn chair. I wish I had a girl that loyal.""

Someone else leaned in, smirking. ""Bet you didn't know this—Chris isn't even into Eleanor. Word is, she threw one of her classic tantrums, and his actual girl had to leave town. You ask that girl for a massage, see if Chris doesn't freak out.""

""Of course I would,"" Chris jumped in. ""If it weren't for Eleanor messing things up, Serena would already be my wife.""Yeah sure, Eleanor has a thing for me, and wants to sacrifice everything for me—but that is her choice. Like I'd ever fall for some self-absorbed snake like her.""

Little did they know, Eleanor had been standing outside the door that whole time, hearing every last word. Her heart clenched, pain spreading through her body.

She thought to herself, 'We grew up together. We have been side by side for years. How could he say something like that?'

In Chris' eyes, Eleanor could never compare to Serena Farrell. Serena was kind, thoughtful, and resilient. He once told Eleanor that Serena reminded him of a wildflower growing out of a cliff—delicate but strong. Eleanor, by contrast, was just some hothouse flower who could never survive without constant care.

Eleanor's whole life had revolved around Chris. She had liked roses, but stopped keeping them around just because he once called them ""tacky."" She had started studying traditional medicine, learned herbal cooking and massage therapy, all for the sake of his health. Eleanor had believed, deep down, that he would eventually fall for her. But turns out, all of that was just a one-woman fantasy.

Inside, the room was full of laughter and good vibes. And then—bam—Eleanor shoved the door open and locked eyes with Chris, who had a girl curled up on his lap. The place went dead silent. Awkward as hell.

Someone tried to break the tension. ""Eleanor, hey, you made it. Chris was just playing the game. You know how it is—around here, a guy without a couple girls hovering is kind of a loser.""

Chris didn't even blink about whether Eleanor had overheard his earlier comments. ""Just some harmless fun. If that is such a problem, then maybe you're not cut out to be my wife.""

""You're right. I am not cut out to be your wife,"" Eleanor said, holding back tears with a calm voice. ""Chris, you do hate me, huh?""

Chris looked at her with pure disgust. He thought, 'Here we go again. That pathetic, about-to-cry face. Who is she performing for this time? That fake innocence was exactly how she got Tyler on her side in the first place.'

""Cut the act. You standing there like a kicked puppy isn't cute. It is just gross,"" Chris said coldly. ""What are you waiting for? My guys and I are playing cards. Go peel an orange and put it next to me.""

Back in the day, whenever Chris wanted oranges, Eleanor would peel them, cut them into perfect bite-sized pieces, and serve them without a word. He had loved that.

But this time, Eleanor didn't budge. She just said, ""Maybe do it yourself.""

Chris was stunned. Eleanor had never used that tone with him before.

""Don't be mad, Mr. Chris. I'll do it."" Chris' new girl giggled. She peeled an orange segment, held half in her mouth, then leaned in. ""Let me feed you.""

Chris threw a glance at Eleanor, smirked, and yanked the girl into his arms. He took the orange piece straight from her lips. Someone shoved the girl from behind, sending their lips crashing together.

""Get a room!"" someone shouted. But a few people kept glancing at Eleanor, clearly uncomfortable.

Eleanor watched Chris swallow the orange and lock lips with the other woman. Her chest tightened. 'There's no way I can stay in this room one more second,'she thought. And just like that, she turned and walked out.

Someone noticed. ""Chris, she's actually pissed this time. Go after her, man.""

Chris barely looked at the door. ""Give it 15 minutes. She'll come crawling back.""

""True that."" Someone nodded. ""Eleanor is head over heels for you. Lucky bastard.""

""Let's bet on it,"" another guy said. ""I give it 30 minutes.""

""I say an hour."" Another laughed.

Eleanor splashed cold water on her face in the restroom and stared at her reflection. ""Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic."" After all those years by Chris' side, this was what she got. She felt something shift in her chest. Something final.

Her phone buzzed. It was Vera Monroe, her best friend.

Vera said, ""Hey, I just landed! Think you can come pick me up? Wait, did you say you had that event with Chris tonight? Never mind—""

""I'm coming to get you. Stay where you are."" Eleanor cut her off.

Outside the arrival gate, Vera waved when she saw Eleanor. ""Look at you, showing up for your girl. I figured you had ditched me again for that trash boyfriend.""

""Not anymore,"" Eleanor said quietly.

Vera's smile faded. She studied Eleanor. ""What happened? That jerk mess with you again?""

""Anyway, enough about him,"" Eleanor said. ""You hungry? Let's grab something to eat.""

They had just sat down in a diner when Chris' name lit up Eleanor's screen. She declined. Then blocked him. No hesitation. A few minutes later, a WhatsApp message popped up. From Chris: \[You done throwing a fit? Get back here already.\]

Eleanor replied: \[We're done.\] Then blocked him again.

""Let me guess. That jerk was calling you?"" Vera asked. ""You are being real chill about it. Usually one call from him and you would run over like he was some VIP royalty.""

Eleanor stirred her coffee slowly. ""I blocked him.""

# Chapter 2 Serena Is Back

Vera thought she misheard, but one look at Eleanor's face told her Eleanor wasn't joking. Vera gave her a thumbs up. ""Well damn, look at you. Growth.""

Compared to how chill Eleanor was, Chris was clearly not. The party was almost over, and she still hadn't shown up. Someone nudged him and said, ""Man, just own up and say 'I love you.' That's all girls want to hear.""

But even if Chris wanted to pull that stunt, he literally could not. Eleanor had blocked him everywhere—phone, social, everything. Sure, they had fought before, but she had never gone full block mode.

He thought to himself, 'Oh, she thinks she can play these mind games with me? Cute. Two can play at this game. Let's see how long she can keep this up.'

Then Chris' phone buzzed, cutting that thought short. It was his uncle, Tyler Langford: \[Your engagement party with Eleanor's next week. How's prep going? Bring her over for dinner tomorrow.\]

Chris frowned, thinking, 'Eleanor really hit the jackpot, huh. Just because she saved Tyler's ass once, now she's got his full support. No way in hell can Tyler find out how I treated her.'

After a moment, he dialed up Linda Donovan, Eleanor's mom. ""Mrs. Donovan, I need a favor—""

At the diner, Eleanor watched Vera inhale her food. ""You were in Mistral Bay, not the middle of nowhere. Did they starve you or something?""

""I was there for a site check, not a vacation."" Vera groaned. ""The cafeteria food sucked. The airport food? Also sucked. Honestly, nothing beats home cooking.""

Eleanor was about to say something when her phone rang. It was Linda.

""You and Chris fought?"" Linda asked. ""The engagement party's next week. Invitations already went out to friends and family. You swore you'd only marry Chris, and now you're pulling this? He told me everything. Look, men mess around sometimes. It's not that deep.""

Eleanor smirked to herself, thinking, 'She's just freaking out I'll bail on the wedding. God forbid she loses her golden ticket to high society and has to face the neighborhood gossip.'

She replied, ""Really? Funny coming from the woman who raised hell when Mr. Donovan slept with his coworker and got her fired. But when it's me, suddenly I'm supposed to be the bigger person?""

""You brat! Is that how you talk to your mother—""

Eleanor hung up before she could finish. She'd had enough.

Chris still hadn't heard back from Eleanor, and it was starting to get on his nerves. His new fling leaned in close again, and he pushed her away without thinking.

'How did I not notice before?' he thought. 'Her perfume is straight-up nasty. It's nothing like Eleanor's scent—light and herbal, actually nice.'

""What's wrong, Mr. Chris?"" The girl pouted.

Chris said nothing. He walked out of the VIP room.

""What's up with him?"" someone asked.

Another guy scoffed, ""What else? Eleanor totally showed him up in public. Women these days, man—they got to learn when to dial it back. Can't be embarrassing a dude like that. No wonder Chris can't stand her.""

Back at the villa, Chris felt his stomach twist. Whenever Eleanor came to parties with him, she would pick out the food that was easy on his stomach and stop him from touching anything that might upset it.

But this time, she wasn't there. Out of spite, he'd eaten spicy food and taken a few shots.

""Wendy, bring me that herbal broth. The one that's good for my stomach,"" said Chris.

Wendy answered, ""Sorry, sir. Miss Donovan always made that herself. I wouldn't know where to start.""

Chris snapped, ""It's just broth. How hard can it be?""

""Well, sir, Miss Donovan said it was made with over a dozen different herbs.

But even if Chris wanted to pull that stunt, he literally could not. Eleanor had blocked him everywhere—phone, social, everything. Sure, they had fought before, but she had never gone full block mode.

He thought to himself, 'Oh, she thinks she can play these mind games with me? Cute. Two can play at this game. Let's see how long she can keep this up.'

Then Chris' phone buzzed, cutting that thought short. It was his uncle, Tyler Langford: \[Your engagement party with Eleanor's next week. How's prep going? Bring her over for dinner tomorrow.\]

Chris frowned, thinking, 'Eleanor really hit the jackpot, huh. Just because she saved Tyler's ass once, now she's got his full support. No way in hell can Tyler find out how I treated her.'

After a moment, he dialed up Linda Donovan, Eleanor's mom. ""Mrs. Donovan, I need a favor—""

At the diner, Eleanor watched Vera inhale her food. ""You were in Mistral Bay, not the middle of nowhere. Did they starve you or something?""

""I was there for a site check, not a vacation."" Vera groaned. ""The cafeteria food sucked. The airport food? Also sucked. Honestly, nothing beats home cooking.""

Eleanor was about to say something when her phone rang. It was Linda.

""You and Chris fought?"" Linda asked. ""The engagement party's next week. Invitations already went out to friends and family. You swore you'd only marry Chris, and now you're pulling this? He told me everything. Look, men mess around sometimes. It's not that deep.""

Eleanor smirked to herself, thinking, 'She's just freaking out I'll bail on the wedding. God forbid she loses her golden ticket to high society and has to face the neighborhood gossip.'

She replied, ""Really? Funny coming from the woman who raised hell when Mr. Donovan slept with his coworker and got her fired. But when it's me, suddenly I'm supposed to be the bigger person?""

""You brat! Is that how you talk to your mother—""

Eleanor hung up before she could finish. She'd had enough.

Chris still hadn't heard back from Eleanor, and it was starting to get on his nerves. His new fling leaned in close again, and he pushed her away without thinking.

'How did I not notice before?' he thought. 'Her perfume is straight-up nasty. It's nothing like Eleanor's scent—light and herbal, actually nice.'

""What's wrong, Mr. Chris?"" The girl pouted.

Chris said nothing. He walked out of the VIP room.

""What's up with him?"" someone asked.

Another guy scoffed, ""What else? Eleanor totally showed him up in public. Women these days, man—they got to learn when to dial it back. Can't be embarrassing a dude like that. No wonder Chris can't stand her.""

Back at the villa, Chris felt his stomach twist. Whenever Eleanor came to parties with him, she would pick out the food that was easy on his stomach and stop him from touching anything that might upset it.

But this time, she wasn't there. Out of spite, he'd eaten spicy food and taken a few shots.

""Wendy, bring me that herbal broth. The one that's good for my stomach,"" said Chris.

Wendy answered, ""Sorry, sir. Miss Donovan always made that herself. I wouldn't know where to start.""

Chris snapped, ""It's just broth. How hard can it be?""

""Well, sir, Miss Donovan said it was made with over a dozen different herbs.",1,1746603922.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

A lot of people are curious about crypto but still hesitate to actually use it.   
Crypto doesn’t have to be complicated. You do not need to start with trading or investing. You can simply try using it like real money.

You are probably already familiar with how traditional banking works. Whether it's paying with your card or withdrawing cash, it’s something people use every day without much thought. But in the crypto world, even though you fully own your assets, it is not always clear how or where you can actually spend them.

So what if you want to use your crypto without converting it to fiat? Have you ever thought about buying gift cards with crypto?

For example, if you want to shop online, you can buy a gift card using crypto and then use the code or QR code at checkout. Or if you want to grab a coffee, just buy the card in advance and scan it at the counter like cash. It is kind of like loading up store credit before you spend. Once it is loaded, you simply scan and go.

Gift cards are just one example of how crypto can be used without relying on banks or exchanges.Would you consider gift cards a practical way to use your crypto in daily life? Or do you have another method that works better for you?

## What is Finzaxor?

Finzaxor is an **AI-powered trading platform** designed to automate and streamline the process of investing in cryptocurrencies, forex, and other digital assets. It’s built for both beginners and experienced traders who want to save time and potentially boost their profits without constantly monitoring the markets.

At its core, Finzaxor uses **algorithmic trading bots** that analyze market trends in real time. These bots can execute trades based on pre-set strategies or user-defined preferences. The idea here is to take the emotional guesswork out of trading and rely more on data-driven decisions.

The platform also provides a **demo account**, real-time alerts, and a dashboard that’s surprisingly easy to use. It’s kind of like having a personal trading assistant that doesn’t sleep.

## Who Created Finzaxor?

There’s not a ton of public info about the exact people or company behind Finzaxor, which is pretty common for platforms in this space. But what we do know is that it was developed by a group of **financial engineers and crypto enthusiasts** who wanted to make high-end trading tools more accessible.

Think of it like this: if Robinhood and an AI hedge fund had a baby, it’d probably look like Finzaxor. The platform seems to be modeled similarly to other automated trading systems like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**, which also focus on ease of use and high-frequency trading capabilities.

While the anonymity of the creators might raise an eyebrow, the platform itself has been gaining traction and positive feedback from users across different regions.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Finzaxor Today](https://is.gd/QuFAUb)
## How Does Finzaxor Work?

Finzaxor works by connecting users to a network of **regulated brokers**, using AI algorithms to scan the market and then execute trades based on market signals. Once you create an account and make your deposit, you can either manually trade or let the **automated bot** do its thing.

Here’s what happens behind the scenes:
- The system constantly monitors the market, using **technical indicators** and **price patterns**.
- When it identifies a potentially profitable trade, it sends an alert or executes the trade automatically.
- You can adjust risk levels, trading pairs, and even set stop-loss thresholds.

It’s basically like having a full-time trader working for you—minus the salary and coffee breaks.

## Finzaxor Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Automation**: Let the AI do the heavy lifting.
- ✅ **Beginner-Friendly**: Clean UI and helpful tutorials.
- ✅ **Multi-Asset Trading**: Not just crypto—also forex, stocks, and more.
- ✅ **24/7 Support**: Actual humans on the other end.
- ✅ **Demo Mode**: Practice before using real money.

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Minimum Deposit**: $250 might feel steep for some.
- ❌ **Not Fully Transparent**: Limited info about the team behind it.
- ❌ **Market Risk**: It’s still trading—profits aren’t guaranteed.

- USA (in select states)

- Canada
- EU countries

### Multiple Asset Trading

This isn’t just crypto. You can trade:
- Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and other altcoins
- Forex pairs (like EUR/USD, USD/JPY)
- Stocks and commodities (through partner brokers)

## Is Finzaxor a Scam?

Short answer: **No**, it doesn’t seem like one. I tested the platform myself, and everything worked as advertised. Funds were deposited and withdrawn without issue, and the support team responded quickly.

That said, always be cautious. No trading platform can guarantee profits, and there’s always a risk of loss. But based on my experience and user reports, Finzaxor appears to be **legit and functional**.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Finzaxor?

You’ll need at least **$250 USD** to start trading. This is pretty standard for platforms in this space, but yeah—it’s a financial commitment. On the plus side, you can use the **demo account** to test things out before going live.

### Finzaxor Customer Support

Support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I tried the chat feature late at night and got a response in under 5 minutes. The reps were polite, knowledgeable, and didn’t just copy-paste answers.

## How do you start trading on Finzaxor?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the Finzaxor website and fill out the sign-up form. It takes about 2 minutes—just basic info like name, email, and phone number.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You’ll get redirected to a **partner broker** for verification. Upload a government-issued ID and proof of address. Once verified, deposit at least $250 to activate your trading account.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Now you can choose between manual or automated trading. Most users opt for the **auto-trading bot**, but if you're feeling confident, manual mode gives you total control.

## How to Delete a Finzaxor Account?

If you decide to part ways with Finzaxor, just contact customer support via email or chat and request an account deletion. Make sure to **withdraw your funds first**, because once deleted, there’s no going back.

## The Verdict

Finzaxor is one of those platforms that’s **quietly powerful**. It doesn’t have flashy marketing or celebrity endorsements, but it delivers where it matters—ease of use, automation, and legit trading tools.

It’s not perfect. The $250 deposit might turn off some beginners, and I wish there was more transparency around the creators. But overall, **Finzaxor feels like a solid choice** if you want to dip your toes into automated trading without getting overwhelmed.

I've been using it personally for some time and, by the analytics of the site, I see that there are some other recurrent users as well.   
I figured I should improve it a bit so, over the past week, I added some things to this new version:

\- Improved the timing between samples when playing them in sequence (to save sample time)

\- Added sample wave form visualization for improved experience

\- Added 4 effects that can be baked in the individual pads (Bit Crusher, Distortion, Reverb, and Delay)

I am happy to improve this further (while keeping it as minimal as can be) so if you have feedback, I'd welcome it (:

The tool is available here: https://po-33-util.capelo.me/

However, I'm getting mixed signals. He's complimented my outfits, but he's never called me pretty. Also, he keeps on bringing up girls who have rejected him in the past. Should I bring these things up with him?

Another thing, he's silent. He makes all of these plans, just to stare at me when he thinks I'm not looking, rather than talk. He is socially awkward, I'm just asking if this is a red flag.

I've never been on a date with someone, so I've already hurt his feeling too by making him drop me off away from my house (I didn't know if my mom would have even allowed me to go out if she knew he was a boy). 

I told her last night, and she seemed fine. Also, we have a date after school soon. We're going to grab a coffee and then watch rom coms at his place.

Her space was neat, her to-do lists clear, and her conscience—mostly—clean. She wasn’t the type to loiter around coffee machines or join in on the endless birthday potlucks. She came to work, did her job, and did it well.

But lately, something shifted. The air felt thicker. Conversations stopped when she entered the room. Invitations to lunch, once sporadic, now ceased completely. She'd catch sideways glances and hear muffled giggles as if her presence was a trigger.

Her coworkers, though often idle, seemed to charm their way into the favor of the higher-ups. They would slip out early, botch deadlines, yet somehow always had a glowing remark passed down about them. Meanwhile, Mira—despite the long hours, the problem-solving, the quiet reliability—was met with silence. Or worse, suspicion.

People began making excuses to visit her desk. Not to collaborate. Not to chat. Just to hover. To peek. To lie about needing a file or checking a form. She could feel their eyes scanning her screen, feel the quiet tension wrap around her like static.

It wasn’t that Mira hated people. She just preferred peace. But in a world where noise equaled presence and presence equaled power, her silence was mistaken for arrogance. Her independence—threatening. Her honesty—too sharp. And her desire to stay out of office drama only made her a bigger target.

She began to wonder: *Am I the problem?* Was her straightforwardness off-putting? Her solitude too loud?

Or… was she just the kind of person others couldn’t control, and that made them uncomfortable?",3,1746601323.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

I’m new to Vancouver — still figuring out if I’m supposed to own 14 rain jackets or just accept being slightly damp forever. But before I fully assimilate into my final form (half human, half coffee), I need help with something:

Where can I get a really good burger around here?

I’m talking:

	•	Smash burgers? Yes please.

	•	Juicy, thick, double-patty beasts? Sign me up.

	•	Vegan burgers that don’t taste like regret? I’m curious.

	•	That one hole-in-the-wall place where you have to elbow a raccoon for a seat but the burger changes your life? I’m there.

Bonus points if the fries don’t suck, and the vibes are solid (I’m still trying to make friends, and apparently you can’t do that with just charisma and ketchup packets).

I've recently purchased BBEI and am satisfied with the espresso shots. However, when using my MHW-3 bottomless portafilter, it sprayed everywhere. My initial hypothesis is the puck preparation and tamping is not optimal with the built-in tamper.

I'm thinking of manually doing WDT after using the built-in grinder in BBEI. Will this help? I also heard that using a distributor/leveler would help before using the built-in tamper..

The next question is how am I supposed to do these pre-tamp puck preparation with the default single-wall double basket portafilter? I tried removing the portafilter after grinding 18g of coffee beans but it spilled everywhere.. Do I pre-tamp it first? Also a dosing funnel wouldn't fit with the default double-spout portafilter.

I find no peace

I find no peace, and all my war is done.
I fear and hope. I burn and freeze like ice.
I fly above the wind, yet can I not arise;
And nought I have, and all the world I seize on.
That loseth nor locketh holdeth me in prison
And holdeth me not—yet can I scape no wise—
Nor letteth me live nor die at my device,
And yet of death it giveth me occasion.
Without eyen I see, and without tongue I plain.
I desire to perish, and yet I ask health.
I love another, and thus I hate myself.
I feed me in sorrow and laugh in all my pain;
Likewise displeaseth me both life and death,
And my delight is causer of this strife.

最后的爱情

啊，当我们暮年将近，
我们爱得愈加温柔、虔诚⋯•
照耀吧，照耀吧，告别之光，
你那黄昏的霞光，最后的爱情！
阴影笼罩着大半个天空，
只有西边的晚霞在缓缓游移，
推迟一下吧，夜的脚步，
延长一下吧，迷人的光辉！
即使血管中的血快要枯竭，
可心中的柔情却不会消亡，
啊你，最后的爱情啊！
你既使我幸福，又令我绝望。

Before Summer Rain

Suddenly, when everything in the park is green.
Something—you don't know what it is-isn't, 
You can feel it coming up to your window 
Standing silent. Pure and strong Birdcalls of a plover in the woods 
Make one think of a sacred name-
So much loneliness and desire 
From a single voice, which the rain 
Will hear soon. The house's hallways Proceed away from us, pictures hang down,
Acting like they don't hear us at all.
Faded flowered wallpaper, a dark mirror,
As the afternoon tries to make up its mind
Like a frightened child.

If I Could Tell You
-Time will say nothing but I told you so,Time only knows the price we have to pay;If I could tell you I would let you know.If we should weep when clowns put on their show,If we should stumble when musicians play,Time will say nothing but I told you so.There are no fortunes to be told, although,Because I love you more than I can say,If I could tell you I would let you know.The winds must come from somewhere when they blow,There must be reasons why the leaves decay;Time will say nothing but I told you so.Perhaps the roses really want to grow,The vision seriously intends to stay;If I could tell you I would let you know.Suppose all the lions get up and go,And all the brooks and soldiers run away;Will Time say nothing but I told you so?If I could tell you I would let you know.

I will remember the kisses
our lips raw with love
and how you gave me
everything you had
and how I
offered you what was left of
me,
and I will remember your small room
the feel of you
the light in the window
your records
your books
our morning coffee
our noons our nights
our bodies spilled together
sleeping
the tiny flowing currents
immediate and forever
your leg my leg
your arm my arm
your smile and the warmth
of you
who made me laugh
again.”

9. Paul Celan保罗策兰 （罗马尼亚）

Night Ray
Most brightly of all burned the hair of my evening loved one:
to her I send the coffin of lightest wood.
Waves billow round it as round the bed of our dream in Rome;
it wears a white wig as I do and speaks hoarsely:
it talks as I do when I grant admittance to hearts.
It knows a French song about love, I sang it in autumn
when I stopped as a tourist in Lateland and wrote my letters
      to morning.

A fine boat is that coffin carved in the coppice of feelings.
I too drift in it downbloodstream, younger still than your eye.
Now you are young as a bird dropped dead in March snow,
now it comes to you, sings you its love song from France.
You are light: you will sleep through my spring till it's over.
 I am lighter:
in front of strangers I sing.

Remember, Body 

Body, remember not only how much you were loved,
not only the beds you lay on,
but also those desires that glowed openly
in eyes that looked at you,
trembled for you in the voices—
only some chance obstacle frustrated them.
Now that it’s all finally in the past,
it seems almost as if you gave yourself
to those desires too—how they glowed,
remember, in eyes that looked at you,
remember, body, how they trembled for you in those voices.  

11. 聂鲁达 （智利）

Here I Love You

Here I love you.In the dark pines the wind disentangles itself.The moon glows like phosphorous on the vagrant waters.Days, all one kind, go chasing each other.The snow unfurls in dancing figures.A silver gull slips down from the west.Sometimes a sail. High, high stars.Oh the black cross of a ship.Alone.Sometimes I get up early and even my soul is wet.Far away the sea sounds and resounds.This is a port.Here I love you.Here I love you and the horizon hides you in vain.I love you still among these cold things.Sometimes my kisses go on those heavy vesselsthat cross the sea towards no arrival.I see myself forgotten like those old anchors.The piers sadden when the afternoon moors there.My life grows tired, hungry to no purpose.I love what I do not have. You are so far.My loathing wrestles with the slow twilights.But night comes and starts to sing to me.The moon turns its clockwork dream.The biggest stars look at me with your eyes.And as I love you, the pines in the windwant to sing your name with their leaves of wire.

12. Leonard Cohen 科恩 （加）

I heard of a man

I heard of a man
who says words so beautifully
that if he only speaks their name
women give themselves to him.
If I am dumb beside your body
while silence blossoms like tumors on our lips.
it is because I hear a man climb stairs and clear his throat outside the door.

- You register and fund your account (min $250)
- Choose your trading mode (manual, semi-auto, or full auto)
- The AI scans markets and predicts trends
- Trades are executed based on signals and your risk tolerance settings

It’s basically like having a smart robot watching the market for you 24/7, trying to catch the best opportunities while you go about your day.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality and completeness of a matcha gift set greatly affect the overall experience. Let's delve into the essential features that distinguish the best offerings in 2025.

**Matcha Quality:** The star of any matcha gift set is undoubtedly the matcha itself. Look for sets that include ceremonial grade matcha. This grade indicates that the matcha is made from the youngest tea leaves, resulting in a smoother, sweeter taste, and a vibrant green color. The origin of the matcha is also important; Uji, Japan, is renowned for producing some of the finest matcha in the world.

**Chawan (Tea Bowl):** A traditional chawan is a vital component for preparing matcha. The ideal chawan should be wide enough to allow for whisking the matcha properly and deep enough to prevent spills. The material is also critical; ceramic is preferred for its heat retention and aesthetic appeal. Look for chawan with a handcrafted feel, reflecting the artistry of Japanese tea ceremonies.

**Chasen (Bamboo Whisk):** The chasen is essential for creating the signature frothy texture of matcha. A good chasen is handcrafted from a single piece of bamboo and features delicate tines that are carefully sculpted. The number of tines can vary, with 80-120 tines being common for ceremonial use. The chasen should be durable and flexible to withstand repeated use.

**Chashaku (Tea Scoop):** The chashaku is a slender bamboo scoop used to measure the correct amount of matcha powder. Traditionally, two scoops (approximately 2 grams) are used for a standard serving. The chashaku should be elegantly curved and made from high-quality bamboo to prevent splintering. Its design allows for precise measurement and adds to the ritualistic aspect of the tea preparation.

**Matcha Sifter:** While not always included, a matcha sifter is a valuable addition, especially for beginners. Matcha powder can sometimes clump, affecting its texture and taste. A sifter helps break up these clumps, ensuring a smoother and more consistent brew. A fine-mesh sifter is ideal for producing the best results.

**Accessories and Packaging:** Beyond the core components, some sets may include additional accessories such as a whisk holder (kusenaoshi), which helps maintain the shape of the chasen, or a tea caddy (natsume) for storing matcha. The packaging of the set is also important. An elegant and well-presented box elevates the gifting experience and reflects the care and attention to detail that goes into the set.

 ## Core Benefits

A thoughtfully curated matcha gift set offers several practical and experiential benefits.

**Enhanced Relaxation:** Preparing and drinking matcha is a ritual that promotes mindfulness and relaxation. The act of whisking the matcha, observing its vibrant color, and savoring its unique flavor can be a calming and meditative experience. This daily ritual can help reduce stress and promote a sense of well-being. For example, using a complete gift set encourages focusing on the present moment, which translates to a calmer and more focused mindset throughout the day.

**Improved Focus and Energy:** Matcha contains L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes relaxation without drowsiness, and caffeine, which provides a sustained energy boost without the jitters associated with coffee. This combination results in improved focus and concentration, making it an ideal beverage for students, professionals, or anyone needing a mental boost. Specifically, the balanced energy from matcha helps enhance productivity and maintain alertness for extended periods without the crash commonly associated with other caffeinated drinks.

**Health and Wellness:** Matcha is rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, offering a wide range of health benefits. It supports immune function, promotes cardiovascular health, and aids in detoxification. Regular consumption of matcha can contribute to overall well-being. For instance, incorporating matcha into your daily routine can help protect your body against free radicals and support a healthy metabolism.

**Cultural Appreciation:** A matcha gift set provides an opportunity to explore and appreciate the rich traditions of Japanese tea ceremonies. It offers a tangible connection to a centuries-old practice that emphasizes mindfulness, respect, and harmony. This cultural immersion can broaden one's perspective and enrich their understanding of Japanese culture. By using authentic tools and following traditional methods, individuals gain a deeper appreciation for the art and philosophy behind matcha preparation.

 ## FAQs Section

**What is the difference between ceremonial grade and culinary grade matcha?**

Ceremonial grade matcha is the highest quality matcha, made from the youngest tea leaves. It has a smoother, sweeter taste and is intended for drinking straight as tea. Culinary grade matcha is made from older leaves and has a more robust, slightly bitter flavor. It's best used in lattes, smoothies, and baked goods.

**How do I care for my chasen (bamboo whisk)?**

To prolong the life of your chasen, soak it in warm water for a few minutes before each use to soften the tines. After use, rinse it gently with warm water and allow it to air dry on a kusenaoshi (whisk holder) to maintain its shape. Avoid using soap or detergents, as they can damage the bamboo.

**How much matcha should I use per serving?**

Traditionally, two scoops of matcha (approximately 2 grams) are used for a standard serving of usucha (thin tea). Adjust the amount to your personal preference, but start with a small amount and increase gradually to avoid bitterness.

**Can I use hot water to prepare matcha?**

No, it's best to use warm water (around 175掳F or 80掳C) to prepare matcha. Hot water can scald the matcha, resulting in a bitter taste. Warm water allows the matcha to dissolve properly and release its full flavor.

Chapter 1-----My Dying Sister Stole My Wedding  
  
I have been imagining the moment I would walk down the aisle in my wedding gown toward the man I loved so vividly that even in my dreams, I could not suppress a smile. I’ve waited for six years for this day.   
  
From nineteen to twenty-five, I dreamt of marrying him. And that day will finally arrive. But in the blink of an eye, that beautiful dream was shattered.  
  
""Audrey, Mr. Nelson came by the atelier this morning and took the wedding dress. Did he bring it home?"" My assistant, Birdie, sounded puzzled over the phone.   
  
Still groggy from sleep, I frowned. ""Theodore took my dress?""  
  
""Yes. You didn’t know?""  
  
""I’ll check with him.""  
  
After hanging up, I’ve snapped out of my grogginess but I still could not understand why Theodore would take the dress so early. \*Our home was already packed with wedding preparations - where would he even put it?\* I had planned to collect it right before the ceremony.  
  
He didn’t answer my first call. When he finally called back, I went straight to the point: ""Theo, did you take my wedding dress?""  
  
""Yes."" His voice sounded hoarse and tired.  
  
""Is there something wrong?"" I asked, concerned.  
  
After a pause, he replied calmly but coldly: ""Audrey, we need to cancel the wedding.""  
  
My ears buzzed as my mind went blank. ""Why?""  
  
""Alyssa has late-stage cancer. The doctors say she only has about three months left.""  
  
For a brief moment, I almost thought it was karma finally catching up to that horrible girl.  
  
""What does it have to do with our wedding?""  
  
""Her final wish is to marry me. She wants to die without regrets.""   
  
Before I could respond, he continued, ""I know this is too much to ask, but she's dying. Can't you find some compassion for her?""  
  
I was so shocked I almost laughed at how ridiculous this was. After a long silence, I asked, ""Theodore, do you even hear what you're saying?""  
  
Theodore's voice was firm, ""Yes, I know what I’m talking about, Audrey. I'm going to marry Alyssa to fulfill her final wish. I know this is unfair to you, so as compensation, I'm willing to transfer 50% of the company shares that I own to you. I hope you can think this over.""  
  
My entire body went numb. ""And if I refuse?"" I asked.  
  
I could tell that Theodore's patience was wearing thin. ""Audrey, can't you show some basic human kindness? Alyssa is your sister. She's dying, and you can’t even grant this tiny wish of hers?""  
  
\*What twisted logic was this?\*  
  
I couldn't help my bitter retort, ""If you care so much about her, why don't you follow her to the grave after she dies?""  
  
""You—"" My words left him speechless. After a tense silence, he changed tactics: ""I've already brought the wedding dress to the hospital. Alyssa's about your size so it'll fit her perfectly.""  
  
Before I could respond, a familiar voice called out in the background, ""Theodore! Alyssa's awake!""  
  
""I'll be right there,"" he answered urgently, then hurriedly said to me, ""Audrey, I need your answer soon.""   
  
The call disconnected before I could reply.  
  
When had Theodore and Alyssa grown so close? Was it when she first rolled up her sleeve to donate blood for him? Or when she cooked for him that first time? Or perhaps when eighteen-year-old Alyssa had boldly declared in front of everyone, “The only man I'll ever love is Theodore. If I can't marry him, I'd rather die!”  
  
Despite our public declaration of marriage at that time, her dramatic proclamation only earned cheers for her ""bravery”.   
  
\*But Theodore—if these are your reasons for marrying her now, then what was the meaning of all my years of devotion?\* I thought to myself. \*I was the one who donated my rare blood that matched yours for five years until you fully recovered\*.   
  
\*When you were weak, I was the one who took care of you by your bedside. I was the one who spent countless sleepless nights by your side when you were hospitalized!\*   
  
\*And now, just because Alyssa is dying, you'd betray me like that without hesitation? And because of that, you're calling off our carefully planned wed to marry her instead?\*  
  
I forced my tears back. That bastard was not worth my tears. The abuse and humiliation I endured in the Shaw family had taught me one truth: Tears would get me nowhere. The only thing that could get things done was action.  
  
I picked up my phone and called the bastard back: ""Theodore, I'll surrender my place as the bride on one condition. I want all the shares of the company. If you agree, come back tonight to sign the papers.""  
  


# Chapter 2---I’ll Marry You Once Your Sister Pass Away

Chapter 2-----I’ll Marry You Once Your Sister Pass Away  
  
I expected him to explode in anger, to yell at me for being greedy. But after just a brief pause, he simply said, ""Fine. I’ll see you tonight.""  
  
Three years ago, we started a high-end fashion label together - Vanessa & Theodore Couture. It had taken off after years of effort.  
  
He was the one who funded it while I handled the designs. For me, it was basically a no-risk deal. Now the company was worth hundreds of millions, and was ready to go public. And despite its endless potential, he was willing to give it all up just to be with Alyssa.  
  
Is this true love between them I sense? Oh the irony.    
  
Getting out of bed, I looked around at all the wedding decorations filling the house. Every piece of them made my skin crawl. I wanted to burn them all.  
  
I called a mover company for help. ""Get rid of everything in this house that belongs to him,"" I instructed the personnel who arrived at my place.  
  
Thank God I insisted on waiting until our wedding before we performed s\*\*\*\*l i\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*e. By the time the house was cleared, I had already changed into fresh clothes and done my makeup carefully. Just as I finished, I heard a car pull up outside. It was Theodore. And he brought Vanessa Brooks - my almost-mother-in-law with him. Interesting. She must’ve thought that I would trick her beloved boy.  
  
""You're here,"" I said coolly, not bothering to stand. I nodded at Theodore before glancing at Vanessa. ""Mrs. Brooks.""  
  
She forced a laugh. ""I thought we were past that? Shouldn't you call me Mom now?""  
  
I smiled sweetly. ""My mother is dead.""  
  
The unspoken words hung in the air: You’re not worthy.  
  
Vanessa's face went completely blank, as if someone had physically slapped her.  
  
Theodore looked equally grim as he stepped forward. ""Audrey, I'm the one who wronged you. Don't take it out on my mother.""  
  
""Oh? So you're saying I should blame your father instead? After all, it’s your old man’s fault for not setting you straight, isn't it?""  
  
""Audrey!"" Theodore's voice sharpened—he was really losing his temper.  
  
I simply shrugged at his response.   
  
Vanessa tugged at Theodore's sleeve. ""Calm down. Let’s talk this through properly.""  
  
With visible effort, Theodore reined in his anger. He straightened his trousers and took a seat in the armchair across from me, then slid a document across the coffee table.  
  
""Here. As you demanded—full ownership of the company. In exchange, our engagement is terminated.""  
  
I picked up the contract and skimmed through it.   
  
""Ownership of the company is one thing,"" I said without looking up. ""What about my wedding dress? That doesn't come free.""  
  
Theodore frowned—clearly not expecting me to be this petty. ""How much do you want for it?""  
  
""Well, with a friends-and-family discount, a million.""  
  
Vanessa gasped. ""Audrey, that's daylight robbery!""  
  
""Mrs. Nelson,"" I said coolly, ""would you like your son to remind you what my designs go for in the fashion world?""  
  
My retort was met with silence.   
  
""Of course, you're welcome to refuse,"" I added lightly, ""But we both know Alyssa wants that specific dress. So no matter the price, Mr. Nelson here will pay for it anyways.""  
  
Theodore's eyes flickered with surprise. He knew I was right. From the moment Alyssa had entered the Shaw household, if I so much as glanced at something—even if it was literal garbage—she'd claw it away from me.  
  
A wedding dress? She could easily get one. But no—Theodore had to take the one I designed with my own hands. And all because Alyssa had demanded it.   
  
Sure enough, after a pause, Theodore nodded. ""Fine. A million dollars it is.""  
  
Vanessa whirled on him. ""Have you lost your mind? Why are you throwing away money like this?""  
  
""Stay out of this, mom."" Theodore brushed off Vanessa's protest and turned back to me.   
  
""Alyssa's too ill to pick out jewelry for the wedding. She said since you've already chosen yours... she'd like to have it.""  
  
Despite already expecting it, the sheer audacity of his request still stunned me for a full second.  
  
""Theodore,"" I said slowly, ""if Alyssa asked for my head on a platter, would you hand it to her as well?""  
  
""Ree, she'd never. Look, it’s just a misunderstanding"" He actually had the nerve to look offended. ""She's just too sick to plan anything. And it's not like you'll need those things anymore.""  
  
I watched him defend her, the corner of my mouth twitching with bitter amusement. ""Do you remember what you promised me, Theodore?""  
  
He promised me that he'd never betray me. That he'd love only me, for the rest of his life—because I'd saved his.  
  
He met my gaze, guilt flashing across his face. ""I do love you, Ree. I’m doing this out of... pity. She's so young Ree, two years younger than you! And she's dying. Aren't you even a little sad? She's your sister. ""  
  
Memories surged up: Alyssa at twelve, scissors in hand, gleefully shredding my favorite dress. Alyssa dumping roaches onto my bed, howling with laughter when I screamed. Of course, I'd chased her with those, trying to shove them down her throat—until she tumbled down the stairs.  
  
My father and stepmother were furious. They beat me black and blue. So I waited until they left and cut every piece of clothing in their wardrobes to ribbons. All these years battling the Shaws, I'd taken my hits—but I'd given as good as I got. But I was alone. There was no hope of me ever coming out on top.   
  
No one could understand the depth of my hatred for Alyssa and that woman she called mother.  
  
And yet they expected me to feel sad now that Alyssa claimed to be dying?   
  
""You're right,"" I sighed, laying a hand over my heart. ""It’s such a tragedy Theo. To have a beauty withering away at such a  young age. My dear stepmother must be devastated. How... awful.""  
  
The irony sailed right over their heads. Theodore actually nodded, eyes glistening, while Vanessa actually had a sad expression on her face.  
  
""Exactly..."" Vanessa's eyes welled up with tears. ""Every child is a mother's flesh and blood. What mother wouldn't be devastated when their child is facing death? We'd rather die in their place.""  
  
""Mom, your heart condition..."" Theodore immediately fretted, before turning to me with sudden gentleness. ""Ree, I'll marry Alyssa first to fulfill her wish, but afterwards... I'll give you an even grander wedding.""  
  
The sheer audacity left me speechless.  
  
""Let me get this straight,"" I said, my voice dangerously calm. ""You want to marry Alyssa first, then—after she dies—come crawling back to me as your second choice?""  
  
I, Audrey Shaw—eldest daughter of the Shaw family. Unfavored, perhaps, but still: my looks, education, talent, and career placed me at the top of Lorborough's elite circles.  
  
What made Theodore Nelson think I'd grovel for his leftovers?  
  
If I were to announce my intention to wed, this city's most eligible bachelors would line up at my door.  
  
Watching my expression shift from shock to icy contempt, Theodore had the decency to look ashamed—but still doubled down: ""You're the love of my life. Of course I'll marry you properly. Don't say it like that... To me, you'll always be my true wife.""  
  
I almost gagged at that statement. Without hesitation, I snatched the contract and signed it with a furious flourish.  
  
""You want the jewelry? Fine. Add another million to the price."" I stood, shoving the papers back at him. ""Wire the money by tomorrow, and I'll personally deliver the set to the hospital and visit my dear sister while I’m at it. ",1,1746600779.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1kgqwcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kgqwcn/update_i_24f_think_i_might_be_abusing_my_fiance/,Update: I (24F) think I might be abusing my fiance (25m),"A little over a week ago I created this account because my fiancé (PJ) had started acting a lot tenser and was acting scared of me. I posted https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k8mg75/comment/mpjuo8i/?context=3 asking if I could be abusive and what to do. I was extremely emotional and having a really bad day already. I'm 5 months pregnant now, and all the hormones are raging.

Basically 2 months ago I found some books on abuse. I asked his friend who's studying to be a counselor (Jane) if they're hers, she told me they were his. I asked him about it, he got dodgy. Things have been tense the last 2 months, until the other day when it blew up. I've been at my mom's house since, while PJs best friend Javi has been staying with him.

Jane showed up Thursday I believe and told me she thought our other friend Julie might be trying to convince PJ i want to kill him. Basically, her evidence is I know a lot about true crime (we listen to Crime Junkies, MMMM, and Morbid together all the time.) And I had made jokes about how I'd get away with murder. (I make jokes like 'oh well that was obvious, of course she was caught! If it was me-) the stupid normal shit. Girls being girls, you know? Sorry. I'm pissed. I haven't slept since Sunday night. I was woken up by mom for dinner and just havent slept since., and I can't even have any coffee or take my sleeping pills. Anyways Julie used to have a crush on PJ before we got together. But she told me it was long gone, and I was stupid enough to believe her.

She's not. Apperantly- according to PJ who told us this while we were in a session Friday- she still likes him. Admitted to never being over him and hating the fact that I'm pregnant. She's been telling him I'm clearly even more unstable now that im pregnant, and that if he were to ever do anything wrong, I'd probably murder him in his sleep. She also used my mom who has bipolar and BPD as an example of 'what im turning into.'

My therapist- the amazing women she is- pointed out that just because I am pregnant, that doesnt mean im unstable. In fact, im doing the best I have been in years. She also pointed out that Julie has been a problem in our relationship before, joking that im abusive, that he's emotionally unavailable, and that our child is doomed.

PJ and I also spoke afterwards. I'm going to be staying with my mom for a while. At least until it's closer to my due date. I want him to cut her off completely. I want her out of our lives and gone for good. But PJ doesnt want to lose one of his closest friends. I'd really take any advice that's not just leave him. I really can't do that. If I were to leave him, I'd have no where to go. The only reason I can stay with my mother right now is because she's been on her meds for the last 6 months. But she goes off them far too often and I can't trust her. I can not afford a place on my own or even with roommates, and a child. I barely make enough to provide for myself and I can't work anymore because I am physically disabled. So please. Please I need advice. Even if it's just on how to finally fucking sleep.

(Also I think I should specify this before all of you immediately start calling PJ schizophrenic or things like that. He is autistic. He is extremely smart when it comes to books, reading, writing, cars, trees, birds, and space and can be the kindest most caring person ever. He's also extremely gullible and easily suggestable. Especially with people he trusts. I dont blame him for believing her. I dont blame him for any of this, really. He has known Julie since they were 13. He has known Jane and Javi since they were 15. Of course if one of your longest running friendships comes to you saying they're worried for your safety, then you might believe them too.)",24,1746600394.0,Advice,23,0.93,False
1kgqvwa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kgqvwa,"Jebena Coffee House, New Lynn","I enjoyed the Ethiopian food at Gojo, so was keen to take people's recommendation to try the Jebena Coffee House in New Lynn.

I ordered the 'Combo' platter (feeds two, $35). It was very substantial coming with two meats and 5 or 6 vegetable dishes.

Lamb tibs was excellent. Cooked in spiced butter.

The other meat was beef cooked with chilli & capsicum in light tomato gravy. Tangy and delicious.

Vegetable dishes were tasty, varied in flavour and very good. Some were outright delicious! It was great to have vegetables on the same level as the meat.

Food is all served on a lightly fluffy and slightly sour ""injera"" bread. This is broken off to wrap & eat the food, and is a tasty complement to absorb the delicious juices.

1kgqpot,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1kgqpot/i_cant_help_but_be_anxious_about_my_father_and/,I can't help but be anxious about my father and mother dying,"Yes I have had OCD symptoms for a long time, but I did become aware of them at some point, and I worked on making them much better, successfully, I think that this time it isn't just pure OCD though, I know that ""when you worry you suffer twice"", and it's not like it's causing me insomnia, but I just worry.

It's inevitable, and as time passes it just seems getting closer and closer, I for one fear death, although I thought I wished to die myself before (depression), and I'm much younger than they are, so I can't just imagine how they feel getting much closer to humans fate, maybe they are at peace with it, but you and I know that no matter how at peace one is, one can never kill that fear, I'm sure they feel bad.

Most of the people I know my age have at least lost a parent already, even people younger than I'm, my parents themselves are losing loved ones left and right, people younger than them, same age, or slightly older, the feeling of that circle closing in is painful.

Now I had a very rough childhood, mother hated me, father is or was a narcissist, they both fucked up my life, for good, at some point I hated each one of them so much that I saw them as the most evil thing in existence, but even with all this hatred I harvested, I still fear their death some how.

Honestly I fear death, for me, for my worst enemy, what's next? their story and their ability to contribute end, book is closed with no more words to be written, we are religious so I should feel safe about having an afterlife, but man just look at how quiet the body of a dead person is, with their eyes closed looking so peaceful, so weak and helpless, almost like they need you to take care of them or help them until they wake up, but you know for a fact that they will never move on their own again, will never utter a word, those videos of them and those memories and visions, they were talking, and now they aren't, feels so weird.

The worst part is, my father is respecting me past few years, after years of shear disrespect and mentally chocking me, even if I talk like shit (which I thankfully tamed so much that it happens so rarely now), he swallows his pride with me, weird, why are you being so weak now?, I don't particularly love him, I don't see any benefit in what he did to me, I could even say some minor bad stuff are still happening by him towards me, but I just feel so bad for him now a days.

Mother, now mother is up and down with me, and that's regarding her tone towards me, so some times fighting some times talking to me very lovingly, but she never actually tries to help me, she never actually care about me and my wellbeing, she only cares about my younger brother and sister, still, just like the old days, yes she stopped being so direct about it, but she still does in her subtle actions, she has so much empathy for my siblings and none for me, yet I can't imagine her dying, when I do I also see her in her ""cute"" phase, like a child who just fear death and wants to be there as much as she can, like a very fragile human being, fuck man, she spent her life serving us, even in her worst physical health status, even when she has a broken arm or a rib, she will be in the kitchen making coffee for father, rarely do you see my siblings or father being less entitled in working her around and giving her some rest.

My siblings really love mother though, and really hate father, I don't know if they would actually be sad about father, but I know they will be devastated for their mother, my brother especially is very obsessive, he keeps imagining mother dying and cries, he fears so much and keeps OCDing about her even saying ouch, so much to the point that he is actually harming her, he is not in good emotional control of himself, so he is like that person who gets angry at their loved ones for being unhealthy and wants them to force health upon themselves some how, my sister is just an emotional sponge who needs her mother for the shear amount of unhealthy emotional support, she just loves to be sad or mad about anything and someone giving her the patting and validation, her brained is wired like that.

This house is so dysfunctional too, if one parent is lost, I can't even imagine what will happen to the unstable 3 kids (me and my siblings, all of us are child adults mid 20s and up)

TL:DR my father and mother made my life miserable at some point in my life, but I'm now grown up and see them as very fragile figures, my father now respects me even if I'm acting like shit, it breaks my heart so much to imagine them lying with no way to ever move nor talk again, and it's not OCD this time, it's just a pure thought.",1,1746599647.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False

During my search for a place, i came across a fb listing that looked like a possible option and maybe would sign after touring the place. Everything seemed fine at first. I was asked to give background on what i do. I informed the other tenant that i work from home 8-5 (with added info).

The messages proceed as follows:

Other tenant: the other roommate is kind of looking for someone who doesn't work fully remote

Me: okay may i ask why?

Other tenant: I guess doesn't prefer someone always in the house. do you ever work at coffee shops or anything?

Me: Thanks for the clarity. I'm looking for a place where I can live and work in peace without having to justify being present in home l'd be paying rent for. It's honestly a bit bizarre to screen tenants based on how often they're in the house, especially when they're quietly working in their room during normal hours. This definitely isn't the right fit, but best of luck finding someone who meets that oddly specific arrangement.

Also, my considerations are because I love coffee but I’m no means a nerd. I’m a mini enthusiast who just likes to dabble a little here and there in extra measurements, but I’m not going to be bothered if small things were off. I like just making good flat whites throughout the day so possibly 3-5 coffees a day in total between my wife and I. With this, I just feel the mini is an overkill machine. Whereas the micra serves that purpose. 

Can anyone convince me otherwise? I’m so tempted just to go back to the store and grab it. But then I’m like ‘what if I move again from this apartment and that machine is then too big? Can I resell it? Trade it? Etc’

My husband (39m) & I (39f) have been married for just over 3 years, we have a toddler together. 

He is polyamorous, I am more of a relationship anarchist (we make up our own rules & agreements, revisiting as needed), but have no real desire to pursue romantic relationships outside of my marriage (but I need to know I *could* if I wanted to).

I do my best to have patience & be open about my feelings whenever he is exploring other connections, without trying to make him feel bad. My only request is that he tell me when a casual conversation is turning into something more invested. I know when my jealousy spikes it's usually just my fear of abandonment & am typically able to communicate that without a need to ""veto"" anything, for lack of a better term.

Conversely, his jealousy feels (to me) out of control. If I so much as joke about finding someone attractive, he gets spiky. Heaven forbid I meet someone I actually want to continue to get to know. I recently gave my number to an old acquaintance I ran into, thinking it would be nice to expand our friend group. He got so upset, giving me the cold shoulder all night & when he did talk, saying things that implied I was being unfaithful.

I tried to take the nonchalant road, made jokes initially to lighten the mood. Failed, just made him more angry. Now he's not speaking to me at all & I'm at a loss. If we hadn't made these commitments, if we didn't have a child together, I am not sure what would happen. But I can't just throw up my hands & give up. I feel like I'm simultaneously not taking things as personally as he is while also being much more serious about our agreements.

He's been struggling with feeling lonely & without friends (parenting is hard y'all). I've tried to support him getting out, meeting people & having time for himself. But he even gets jealous when I just give a friend a ride or go grab coffee with someone during my work day.

Tl;Dr - quasi-mono/poly marriage with child, poly partner extremely jealous to the point of damaging the relationship.",4,1746599460.0,polyamory,7,1.0,False

**IN A NUT SHELL**

* **The essential human elements AI can’t replicate**. Software engineering is fundamentally an art form requiring human creativity, imagination, and aesthetic judgment.
* **AI lacks the human consciousness** to truly grasp user needs for meaningful software, evidenced by the Chinese Room.
* While AI will evolve the role of software engineers (similar to pilots managing automation), **humans will remain essential for architectural oversight, ethical considerations, & ensuring software resonates with human users and values**.

 

# Software Engineering Is an Art—And Only Humans, Not AI, Can Be the Artists

Back in 2023, the first task I was assigned at a company I had just joined was to create a “foldering” feature to organise courses. It required me to build both the frontend and the backend. The backend was never a problem—that’s where my strengths lie. However, it had been a while since I’d worked on frontend tasks, and to make things more challenging, the codebase required me to use Stimulus.js and ViewComponent—frameworks I had no prior experience with.

Then came ChatGPT to save the day—or rather, my two-week sprint. Boom. Combined with my 13 years of web development experience, ChatGPT felt like a mech suit I could wear to complete tasks far more efficiently. That was my first taste of this new superpower. It felt like I’d been injected with Compound V. With that, I thought to myself: I can do anything. But at the same time, I couldn’t help but wonder—maybe a living, breathing software engineer might not be needed at all.

**This made me reflect: what is software engineering, really?** At first glance, it appears very mechanistic—a programmer churning out code all day with the occasional meeting in between. Some days, all an engineer might do is figure out how a specific part of a framework works, or why a particular version of a library breaks the codebase. And yes, what could take an entire day for an engineer might now be reduced to just a few minutes with the help of an AI model.

It’s easy, then, to think of a software engineer as a factory worker. But this notion is fundamentally flawed. A software engineer isn’t producing the final product—they are designing the blueprint that produces the final product. The computer is the real factory worker.

To better understand this, consider a historical example. In the early 1900s, Einstein had what he described as the happiest thought of his life. He imagined a window cleaner falling from the top of the building across from his office. He realised that while falling, the man wouldn’t feel his own weight—he would be weightless. Anything he dropped would remain stationary relative to him, as if he were floating in outer space. This simple thought experiment eventually led Einstein to the theory of general relativity.

Albeit on a smaller scale, software engineering as a form of problem-solving is comparable to the imagination and creativity that gave rise to the most profound scientific theories. As a software engineer, haven’t you ever found yourself building the software entirely in your head—rearranging user flows as if you were designing a factory, visualising servers interacting like satellites exchanging signals, or imagining classes as real-world objects communicating with one another? These are not merely exercises in modeling reality—they are expressions of creativity and imagination, both of which require a conscious inner life. And that is something AI fundamentally lacks.

**Software engineering, then, is not a mechanistic exercise—it is an artform**. It requires not just technical know-how, but a deep well of creativity, imagination, and aesthetic judgment. Just as a painter envisions the final composition before brush meets canvas, or a composer hears the melody before a single note is written, a software engineer often envisions a solution before a single line of code is typed. The design of elegant architectures, the crafting of intuitive interfaces, the balancing of performance and maintainability—these are acts of creation, not just construction. Like Einstein imagining a falling man to grasp the nature of gravity, the best software engineers draw from their private inner world to shape the digital one.

**The limitations of AI become clearer when we consider the Chinese Room**, a thought experiment by philosopher John Searle. It challenges the notion that artificial intelligence can truly understand language. In the scenario, a person who doesn’t know Chinese is locked in a room and given a set of rules for manipulating Chinese characters. By following these instructions, they produce responses that appear fluent to a native speaker outside. Yet, despite generating convincing answers, the person still doesn’t understand Chinese—they’re merely following syntactic rules without any grasp of meaning. Searle uses this to argue that computers, which process symbols based on rules, similarly lack genuine understanding or consciousness—even if they appear intelligent.

https://preview.redd.it/m4uu5dlk0bze1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=815cecdc8620bed5339dbc13198dc526dcddf707

In contrast, human beings are experiencing—their thoughts, their feelings, their surroundings. This is known as phenomenal consciousness: the subjective, qualitative experience of being—what it feels like from the inside. It’s often described as the “what it’s like” aspect of experience. For example: the redness of red, the bitterness of coffee, the pain of a headache.

**The ability to create stems from the capacity to experience—not from large-scale data collection or pattern recognition**. This creativity is what drives the world forward and gives meaning to what we do—something no AI model possesses. Yes, there may come a time when AI appears to have phenomenal consciousness, but only because humans tend to create AI in their own image. AI will never truly replicate this seemingly out-of-nowhere ingenuity or imagination—just as Einstein once imagined a window cleaner falling from a building.

As I argue, **software engineers will never become obsolete**. However, their roles will inevitably evolve over time—much like the evolution of airline pilots. Today, modern aircraft are equipped with sophisticated avionics and autopilot systems capable of handling most aspects of a flight, from takeoff to cruising, and even landing. Pilots no longer “fly” in the traditional sense for most of the journey; instead, they manage systems, monitor automation, and intervene when human judgment is required. This shift hasn’t rendered pilots irrelevant—it has elevated their responsibilities. They now function more like systems managers or flight operations specialists, requiring a deep understanding of complex automation, the ability to respond in exceptional situations, and the judgment to ensure safety where machines may fall short.

This same transformation is beginning to occur in software engineering. **As AI systems increasingly handle repetitive and logic-based coding tasks, the role of the engineer shifts toward architectural oversight, ethical decision-making, system integration, and safeguarding human values in automated processes**. Rather than being replaced, software engineers will be redefined—working alongside AI as stewards of complex, intelligent systems.

Yes, the **coding aspect of a software engineer’s role may diminish a little bit. But the human factor remains essential—because the users of software are also human**. AI will never understand the frustration of a poor user flow or the joy of using a beautifully responsive web page. It will never experience being human (or experience in general), and therefore, it will never be able to truly build software for humans.

As the physicist Richard Feynman once said, “What I cannot create, I do not understand.” We may be able to build an AI or robot in the image of a human—but that’s all. We will never be able to create one that experiences life as we do, because we do not understand consciousness or the nature of “private inner lives.” Just look at the [Hard Problem of Consciousness](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hard_problem_of_consciousness#:~:text=The%20hard%20problem%20of%20consciousness,processes%20ever%20accompanied%20by%20experience%3F). Software engineering demands not only logic but also an appreciation and intuitive feel for the problem being solved—something AI will never truly possess.",1,1746599459.0,reinteractive,0,1.0,False

## What is Gold Ledgerix?

Gold Ledgerix is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users trade various financial assets like cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex, and even commodities. Think of it as a smart assistant that tracks market trends, analyzes data, and helps you make informed decisions—or even trades on your behalf if you enable automation.

The platform caters to both beginners and seasoned traders by offering a **user-friendly interface**, **real-time analytics**, and **customizable trading settings**. It’s kind of like having a mini Wall Street analyst in your pocket, minus the espresso addiction and fancy suit. Whether you're trying to dip your toes into the crypto pool or you're already riding the wave, Gold Ledgerix claims to have tools that can help you catch the right trades.

## Who Created Gold Ledgerix?

This is where things get a little murky. The creators of Gold Ledgerix haven’t gone public with their identities, which is *pretty common* in the trading platform space. From what I can tell, it’s likely developed by a team of fintech engineers and market analysts who’ve worked on similar platforms like Bitcoin Era or Immediate Edge.

While the anonymity might make some people uneasy, it's not a red flag by itself. Many legit platforms have anonymous founders, especially in the crypto world. That said, I’d still love a little more transparency—like, give us a LinkedIn page or a name drop, guys.

It’s not exactly “set it and forget it,” but it’s close—especially if you’re not looking to stare at candlestick charts all day. Just don’t expect magic. Like all trading platforms, **it still carries risk**.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Gold Ledgerix?

Gold Ledgerix is **web-based**, meaning you can access it from any device that has a browser. Whether you’re on a MacBook, Windows PC, iPhone, or Android tablet, you’re good to go. The site is **mobile-optimized**, so it adjusts nicely to smaller screens.

That said, there’s currently **no standalone mobile app**. This isn’t a dealbreaker, but it would be nice to have push notifications or a dedicated app interface. For now, just bookmark it in your browser and you’re set.

## Gold Ledgerix – Supported Countries

Gold Ledgerix appears to be available in **most countries**, including the US, UK, Australia, Canada, and parts of Europe. Some regions with strict trading regulations (like North Korea or Iran) are naturally excluded.

If you’re unsure whether your country is supported:
- Try registering an account.
- If it goes through, you’re probably in the clear.
- Otherwise, a message will pop up saying it's not available in your region.

## Gold Ledgerix – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

Gold Ledgerix gives you **live market data** with real-time updates. This is crucial for traders who want to make snap decisions based on the latest info. From price movements to trend indicators, it’s all built into the dashboard.

Whether you're into scalping or swing trading, having access to **up-to-the-minute stats** helps you stay ahead of the curve.

### User-Friendly Interface

The UI is clean, modern, and simple to navigate. No clutter, no confusing jargon. Even if you’ve never traded before, you can find your way around within 10 minutes.

There’s also a helpful tutorial for new users, which guides you through setting up your account and placing your first trade. Big win for beginners.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there’s no dedicated app, the platform works flawlessly on mobile browsers. I tested it on both iPhone and Android, and it adjusted well to different screen sizes. You can monitor trades, deposit funds, and even chat with support—all from your phone.

So, even if you’re out grabbing coffee or stuck in traffic (not recommending this), you can still keep tabs on your portfolio.

### Customizable Alerts

This is one of my favorite features. You can set **price alerts, stop-loss triggers, and profit targets**. The system notifies you when your criteria are met, so you don’t have to watch the screen all day.

It’s like having a financial assistant who only bugs you when something important happens.

### Multiple Asset Trading

You’re not locked into just crypto. Gold Ledgerix lets you trade:
- Cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, XRP, etc.)
- Forex pairs (USD/EUR, USD/GBP)
- Stocks (Apple, Tesla, etc.)
- Commodities (Gold, Oil)

This makes portfolio diversification super easy. You can hedge your bets without jumping between platforms.

## Is Gold Ledgerix a Scam?

From what I've seen and tested, **Gold Ledgerix doesn’t appear to be a scam**. The platform functions as advertised, deposits and withdrawals work, and customer support is responsive.

That said, it’s important to remember:
- It’s **not regulated**, which means it doesn’t have a financial authority overseeing it.
- It’s **high-risk trading**, so you can lose money just as easily as you can make it.

Always do your own research and **never invest more than you’re willing to lose**.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Gold Ledgerix?

You’ll need at least **$250 to get started**. This is pretty standard for platforms like this, but I get that it might be a barrier for some.

The good news? You don’t have to invest it all at once. You can start small and scale up once you’re comfortable with the platform.

### Gold Ledgerix Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I tried both and got a reply within 10 minutes through chat and around 2 hours via email.

They’re friendly, knowledgeable, and don’t try to upsell you. Always a plus.

## How do you start trading on Gold Ledgerix?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head to the Gold Ledgerix website and fill out a quick registration form. You’ll need your name, email, and phone number. No need to overthink it—takes 2 minutes max.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once registered, you’ll be prompted to **verify your identity** (standard KYC stuff). Then, make your initial deposit—minimum is $250. You can use credit cards, bank transfers, or e-wallets.

### Step 3: Start Trading

After funding your account, you can either start trading manually or activate the **auto-trading feature**. I tried both, but auto-trading is smoother for beginners.

## How to Delete a Gold Ledgerix Account?

If you decide the platform’s not for you, just contact support and request account deletion. They’ll verify your identity and close your account within a day or two.

No shady retention tactics or endless emails. Clean break.

1kgqj3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kgqj3w/post_divorce_dating/,Post divorce dating,"Hey all, 33f, in process of divorce from 10 yr marriage, 17r relationship from 34m with a young kid. Met 35m on an app a little over a month ago. He's also (last couple years) divorced from long term partner, kid involved for him as well, but he doesn't have visitation because he was a step parent. 

We've been texting almost daily

I wasn't looking for anything serious, just someone to flirt with and get my head out of  ruminating on my ex. Not in an, I want to get back together sense, but in a ""my ex still texts me abusive shit at least once a week and I can't block him because we have a child together and no legal custody documents yet"". I have no regrets on leaving him. I've been in my own place 2 months, separated 6. My ex has our kid on the weekends (I work every weekend) 

Anyways. 35m from apps told me on our second date (after about 2 weeks of texting) he wasn't over his ex, he just wanted to be friends. I said that was fine, and we kept hanging out, which ended with me hanging out at his apartment til 4 am (but no kissing or etc.). Conversation is easy, we can get talking for hours. I sent him a text the next morning saying something like ""hey, thanks for the dates and thanks for letting me down soft. If you ever want to get coffee as friends, let me know"" which I thought was giving him a solid out.  but his texting habits didn't change. He still sends me good morning texts around 615 most mornings and we text 3 or 4 times a day, just like, the projects we're both working on, how the days going, plans, etc. 

We talked about a movie, and I asked him if he wanted to come watch it with me (3rd weeks in)- he kind of blew me off, didn't get back to me for a couple days but then picked up talking like normal. It sounds like he had something happen, but hasn't said anything specific. I only have one evening where I am not at work and also  don't have my daughter, so that curtails my social life, especially when I'm not ready for him to meet her in any way. I asked him if he had plans the next weekend (4 weeks into talking) and he said he did, but we should make plans for next week (he knows I'm only really free that one night). 

I know I'm not ready for anything serious right now, but I do like him, and I want to kiss him quite a lot. He hasn't tried anything, but he has hugged me. when we were at the bar, we had our faces pretty close together to hear each other and that was chemistry. I also want to respect his boundaries. We have plans for this weekend (which will be after 5 weeks of talking). 

I don't know how adults date. Is this normal?


Is this a horrible idea? Am I just deluding myself into maybe he might be interested but not wanting to date right now? Am I just trying to punish  myself? I'm happy with how things are,  talking and flirting awkwardly and texting, but I would also be happy if it became something more and I'm not in a rush. How do you know when to call something like this quits ? Do I bring up how I'm feeling?

My coworker—my boss’s 25‑year‑old friend—keeps getting all the fun assignments, slipping out of the office with my boss for “coffee runs” or “errands,” then leaving me to clean up their unfinished work well into the evening. It feels unfair… but what really unsettles me is how they laugh together, exchange knowing looks, and cover for each other when my boss’s wife calls. I have no proof, but I can’t shake the feeling they’re in an intimate relationship that she doesn’t know about.

Yesterday, after staying until 8 PM to finish their slide deck, I finally confronted them: “Shouldn’t you two be doing this together instead of sneaking off?” My boss looked furious, and my coworker just stared. Now the office is icy, and I’m questioning whether I crossed a line by calling out what feels like more than just work favoritism.

I read that boiling hard water causes the plastics to get a hard shell and makes it easier to boil them out

  
The tap water I get likely has some amount of lead since the tubes are old (60+ years) im not sure that would necessarily count as hard water, but anyways  

 I boil the water 

Do I strain it while its hot or room temp or cold? 

Third wouldn’t it be strained through a coffee filter? Don’t they have plastic in them?
