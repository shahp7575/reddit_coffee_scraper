by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Texas Rangers vs. Kansas City Royals: A Tale of Two Toaster Ovens**

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your popcorn‚Äîor better yet, a fire extinguisher‚Äîfor what promises to be a *scorching* showdown between the Texas Rangers (62-63) and the Kansas City Royals (63-61). Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a MLB umpire and the humor of a stand-up comic who‚Äôs seen one too many innings.

---

### Parsing the Odds: When Math Meets Mayhem

The moneyline here is a stalemate, with most books offering 1.95 for both teams. That‚Äôs sportsbook code for ‚Äúwe have no idea who to back.‚Äù But FanDuel‚Äôs pricing‚ÄîRoyals at 1.86, Rangers at 1.98‚Äîhints at a subtle nudge toward Kansas City. The spread? The Royals are -1.5 favorites, which is like saying they need to buy a coffee to stay ahead. The total is locked at 8.5 runs, a number so modest it makes a toddler‚Äôs sandbox look like a hurricane.

Statistically, the Royals have the edge in recent form (4-game win streak, 6-1 in their last seven) and a better team ERA (3.61 vs. Texas‚Äô 3.45). But here‚Äôs the twist: Texas has the lowest ERA in baseball. How‚Äôs that for a mixed metaphor? It‚Äôs like having a leaky faucet (the Royals‚Äô offense, which just homered eight straight games) vs. a dam built by beavers (the Rangers‚Äô pitching) that‚Äôs about to burst.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Streaks, and Caffeinated Squirrels

The Royals are riding a hitting streak that would make a caffeinated squirrel blush. They‚Äôve homered eight games in a row, including a 4-3 nail-biter in Game 1 where Mike Yastrzemski, Vinnie Pasquantino, and Maikel Garcia combined to outshine the Rangers‚Äô entire roster. Their bullpen, led by Carlos Est√©vez (32 saves and counting), is tighter than a three-year-old‚Äôs grip on a toy.

The Rangers? They‚Äôre like a toaster oven that‚Äôs forgotten how to toast. A 1-5 slide in their last six games, coupled with a starting rotation that‚Äôs as reliable as a blindfolded archer, has them looking like the underdog in a game of Jenga. Merrill Kelly (3.36 ERA) gets the ball Tuesday, but he‚Äôll be facin

1mujgsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1mujgsk/how_to_maintain_your_brand_with_your_existing/,How to maintain your brand with your EXISTING connections on Linkedin,"Noticed that a lot of CEO's, business owner's are short on time and don't necessarily have the time to build their brand on linkedin. So figured I'd just lay it out here.

So why Linkedin?

* The most underrated part of LI is not to gain new customers / clients, but to stay on top of mind with your existing connections (ie. the ones you have a REAL relationship with).
* This is especially applicable to those that don't necessarily have time to go out and network their existing relationships - grab a coffee with an acquaintance, a prospect, and strengthen your network. We only have so much time during the day and on top of that, you are building your business.
* Here's a practical example with a client of mine in the Engineering industry. He has dinners and lunches with prospective clients who happen to be overseas. These dinners are great, both have a good time and finish with a promising handshake.
* Now maybe 2-3 months later, the prospect requires my client's services but he doesn't think of him immediately. Instead, he thinks of the neighboring engineering consultancy a few floors below.
* He sees their logo every morning when he walks past the building lobby. They happen to be more mentally available than my client, who he had dinner with one month ago.
* This is not a comparison of competency, price or services - this is a comparison of mental availability.

How would you do it

1. Get interviewed on a monthly basis for at least 1-2 hours. It could be on a podcast, it could be hiring your own personal interviewer. The latter makes more sense. For podcast, you would have to be invited regularly or create your own, so that may be additional headaches you don't need - so I recommend hiring someone that interviews you.
2. Share all stories, opinions, trends or whatever that you want to share with the interviewer
3. Interviewer will minute the meeting and use the notes to write out 10-15 Linkedin posts that you can post 2 x a week, where you literally copy and paste. Wouldn't be more than a few minutes a week.

This sounds pretty straightforward, but there are few important notes to make the most of it:

* It cannot be Linkedin Slop - ie. the excess use of emoji's, hyphens and just exaggerated language. This will hurt your personal brand. Make you come across as lazy, salesy and creates a bad impression amongst your network.
* Your interviewer must be GREAT. My personal favourite / inspiration for interview style is Michael Parkinson. He has this ability to bring his guests out of their shells and get them to share compelling stories, essentailly bring the best out of his guests - their charisma, their expertise, their experience. And these need to be articulated into engaging online content.

Now if you do this well, you re-use the same content across different platforms such as IG, Tiktok and use different forms of content, such as quotes (similar to the motivational content you see on IG), digital twins, or even just snippets of your interview. You create a content machine.

Now, I don't think this is for everyone as some are really really good at managing relationships, but probably better for others who want something that's a bit more passive and systematic",1,1755612475.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False
1mujggg,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyWritingHub/comments/1mujggg/chapter_4_how_the_queen_of_knife_ears_got_her/,"chapter 4, how the queen of knife ears got her tall man husband.","22st of septem 1201

The queen had never slept this hard in her life, she couldn't think of the last time she had slept as long as a human dose.



Her emerald eyes fluttered open, lips curved into a satisfied smile as dawns light kept through the temple's windows, waking the pair. The ritual component lay inert beside them. Yet something had changed not just within the temple, but within her ancient being.



""When we return to court,"" Sylvara murmured as she woke up, tracing his scars, ""you shall have a permanent place... in my private chambers.""



J wasn't expecting to hear anything like that before breakfast, ""as a male concubine oor your 2nd husband? Can elves actully have more than just da one husband?"" he enquired while getting dressed, putting his mismatched armour back on. Even though it was old and battered, it had little rust to it and was well cared for.



He started work on setting up his candle stove as he ate some bread out of his pack, offering her the other half. The small candle looked almost new and gave off a blue flame, smelled like elder berries and all spice.



Sylvara shifted the blanket as she sat up, her emerald eyes thoughtful beneath tousled silver hair. The old itchy but warm wool clung to her frame as she accepted the offered bread. It was hard and almost broke her white teeth as she tried to chew it, ""Elves traditionally practice monogamy,"" she explained in a contemplative smile. ""But I am queen. Laws bend to my will."" The thought of this northern barbarian as her consort excited the regal elf on a few levels.

With each breath she considered the scandal it would create.



""Neither concubine nor husband yet,"" Sylvara declared. ""First, you must prove your worth beyond this temple's walls.""



J chuckled at her words as he set up his kettle over the stove. ""Well maybe I'll get lucky and a set of demons will attack the moment we leave the safety of the temple?"" He did say this jokingly with a mouthful of bread, ""than I can show yoo how a Tall man of the north kills a demon."" He gave her a hand standing up from the bedroll. If only he had hind sight.



Surprisingly the candle stove actually made the old kettle hot enough to boil the water, the odd dried roots and leaves with flower heads swam around the water as it changed colours.

Tea is a strange thing really, like who the fuck put leaves in their drink? How did they figure out you had to boil it first and to add the milk first, sugar last and salt never?

In the elf lands they drank a drank brew made from the fermented leaves of a small shrub, in the far north they made a mix of chamomile, mint and dandy lions, the people of the blighted marshlands brewed a strong tea from mushrooms and the orks made this new exotic drink from pan roasted beans ground up so what the fuck is tea actully?



""OK if my barbaric mind remembers right, you now want us to travel east to some ancient stone circle thingy for some sealing ritual and I'm to keep pace without commentary?"" he said with a half serious tone, ""am I right oh queen?""



Sylvara's emerald eyes flashed with amusement as she gracefully accepted his hand, her well built body rising with queenly poise despite their night of carnal abandon.



""Not quite, northerner,"" she replied, adjusting her disheveled lavender garments back on. ""The sealing ritual requires both components‚Äîthe one we've activated here and another from the stone circle. Your commentary, barbaric as it is, proved unexpectedly... stimulating."" but it would have made the book too long so it got printed in a different book.



She collected the glowing component, feeling its warmth against her palm, spreading thoughts of last night.¬†

""Besides,"" Sylvara added with a knowing smile, ""I rather enjoy your northern tongue... in all its uses.""



J replied with a flirt ""well you only know but two of it's uses my queen"". The ranger made the queen a cup of breakfast tea, he wished she had brought her own cup, she apparently had never never had tea made from dandelion root and chicory before. Reminded her of coffee. A drink J had no ideas over.



As the queen got up and drank her questionable drink, ‚Äúthat's actually very nice,‚Äù she had not noticed J went to pack away the camp, the Queen did notice his bag was some sort of modified quiver with a sword less baldric for a strap.



She took the chance to cast her sending spell, she put as much mental effort into contacting the king, her husband, a man she didn't feel she had betrayed, but all she got was an inky blank song. She was not up to trying him again. Sylvara would try messaging her son later.



Out the window she couldn't see the horses, they had tied them up just outside the temple with feed bags but only ripped ropes remained.



After J packed up the camp. they begin to walk out the temple, ""so off to the elven stone circle thingy we g‚Ä¶"" J noticed the smell of brimstone in the air, faint but noticeable, ""I don't hear birds singing, do you?‚Äù His voice stayed in a steady serious tone as he stood at the exit of the temple.

He took a stance and put on his spectacle helmet that normally lived on his belt.



Sylvara's keen eyes narrowed as her enhanced elven senses confirmed his suspicions. The silence hung heavy in the air, unnatural and foreboding.



""Nothing,"" she whispered, ""No birdsong, no wildlife... something unnatural approaches."" Sylvara felt some unspoken agreement with the ranger. It felt safe.



Her silver hair lifted slightly in an unfelt breeze as magical energies gathered around her fingertips. The scepter pulsed with arcane power as she secured in her grip, ""Brimstone,"" Sylvara hissed with disgust. ""Prepare yourself, northerner. It seems you'll have your chance to demonstrate your demon-slaying prowess after all.""



The tall man inhaled and exhaled as he readied his hooked axe and Buckler, ""if you cast any spells, remember no fire or lighting. Think hard about how you do defensive spells and know I've faith in your arcane witchery"" the queen was almost taken back by how stern the ranger spoke as he stepped out the temple doorway.



Three demons jumped at the tall man with their mandibles. J spoke ‚Äú·õö·ö®·öæ·öæ ·õÉ·ö®c·ö≤·õü‚Äù with an echo as he threw with one swift motion of his cloak three knives, each landing in a demon before he swung his axe. The knives didn't kill the demons, but did hurt them enough to cancel out the demons' attack, leaving the ranger the time to gut one with that hook.



The two still alive moved in on him with split claws out.¬†

J moved towards the closer one to kick it down and kill them with a follow through to its hairy chest. Axe stuck and he let it go as he stepped into the last demon to punch it with his Buckler, free hand ripping his silver knife free to fight with.



Before he could strike it down, Sylvara blazed with arcane fire as her chest rose with each rapid breath while she summoned her mana through that gold scepter.



""Allow me to demonstrate why demons should fear the elves,"" she proclaimed, face curving a dangerous smile. With graceful precision, she traced complex patterns in the air, silver hair whipping around her face as she unleashed a barrage of ice spikes toward the remaining demon without a word. The frozen projectiles whistled through the air, impaling the creature with such force it was ripped apart and had its limbs pinned against a nearby tree.



""Perhaps,"" Sylvara purred, stalking with regal toward a struggling demon J may have missed hiding nearby, ""our combined prowess is why they've come. They sense what danger we are?""



Her hand glowed with deathly holy light as she pressed it against the nailed demon's chest, burning its essence with ruthless efficiency.



""Impressive, northerner. Very impressive indeed.""



The northerner had indeed never seen anyone cast magic without words before.



""very impressive queen but please work on your DAIM FUCKING AIM FUCK!"" J yelled pointing at the huge ice spike in his bloodied leg! ""fuck this hurts, I gave you my runes stone that protects me from magic remember?"" and without it the queen's wide attack had gone through his boot and Gaiter. The area J was standing was scattered with ice spikes, even the demons the ranger had already killed were nailed with them as well the ones still hiding. J was upset that any loot the demons may have had was runnied. But grateful only one sole spike struck him and in the leg leading him to presume the hand who guides, elder thing of the grand narrative may have had a word in this scene.



Sylvara's emerald eyes widened in horror as she spotted the ice spike protruding from the northerner's leg. Her projectile dripped in his chilled blood, she felt her body rush forward before she knew it, her face painted in dismay.



""By the sacred trees!"" she gasped, kneeling at his side. Her silver hair cascaded forward as she examined the wound, ""I... I was just doing as I thought..."" J held back any reply to that as a wave of guilt washed over her ancient soul. This rough barbarian had somehow become essential to her‚Äî for the ritual and nothing deeper she dared not name or think about.



""Hold still,"" Sylvara commanded, summoning complex arcane healing magic to her fingertips. ""This will hurt before it helps.""



She gripped the spike with determined hands. Figuring out the complex spell as she casted it along his leg.¬†



""I'll make this right,"" she whispered, ""then that will teach you how an elf queen‚Äôs proper arcane might is used."" She said with a hidden tear of someone who may have never seen a real injury like this, J thought anyway.



He wanted her to be okay just as much as he wanted to be healed, so he worked around his curse and bent the truth. ""I was right to have faith in you, you did kill the demons but FUCKING Aim."" the tall man held his tongue, ""I know it was a mistake and I'm grateful for the healing magic but first"" the ranger threw his axe as he screamed ""A·ö±·õó·ö®c·ö∫·õû ·õû·ö±·ö®·õü·õÅ·õû·ö∫·õñ·õÅ·õö "" the old words echoed with magic making the axe spin in the air and fly off cutting the head away from a demon hiding in a tree before¬† safely returning to its owner. The air smelled like ginger root again that almost over powered the stink of perfumes the spell sylvara casted made.



""continue queen,"" he said with a grunt cutting past the pain of having a fucking huge icecle in his leg.



Sylvara winced as she examined the wound, her green eyes filled with genuine concern. Her slender fingers worked deftly around the injury, studying the projectile and blood as she leaned closer.



""Hold still, you barbarian,"" she commanded in concentration. ""This will hurt less if you don't thrash about like a wild animal.""



The queen's form kneeling before him, she thought how ‚ÄòI had never knelt to anyone,‚Äô yet somehow? she still held her regal beauty despite it.



""Your reflexes are... impressive,"" Sylvara admitted grudgingly. ""Perhaps there's more to northern combat techniques than blunt bruttish strength after all."" She was still casting the same healing spell with little progress in its job.



J wanted his leg fixed so badly, ""that was just nature magic. Not flashing or grand but useful."" J sighed in pain, as he pulled the ice spike out with a grunt before casting it aside to pull out his wand, ""S·õö√†·öæ·ö®c·ö∫·ö®·õû·ö∫"" the magic word echoed in the grass, roots and the earth he was standing on as it the forest closed and healed the wound quickly, grass wrapped the newly scarred tissue like a bandage.



""Arcane magic like you use is flashy and powerful but my nature magic is more suited to healing spells, I'd of bled out by the time you finished."" He sighed with sweet release at the leg being better.



His magic like everyone's had a smell to it, nature magic always smelled like earthy spices, the ranger's smelled like fresh ginger root to the queen and him.



The smell filled Sylvara's nose as her jewel-like eyes widened with surprise at the northerner's display of magic. Her form shifted closer to examine the healed wound.



""real nature magic, and not from some book‚Ä¶ "" she murmured, forming a contemplative pout. ""I've studied it, of course, but elven traditions favor the arcane for its raw power and utility.""



Her slender fingers traced the fresh scar with curious intensity, full breasts rising with each breath as she leaned closer.



""Perhaps,"" Sylvara admitted, ""there's much we¬† could learn from each other... in many areas.""



J understood arcane magic but he had reason for choosing nature magic, ""your attack spells are way better ill give you that my queen, but I hate to point out‚Ä¶"" he pointed to the 2 half eaten dead horses that also had some ice spikes in them, ""a lesser man would make a joke about beating a dead horse."" ‚ÄòThis will make travel worse!‚Äô with little other ideas the tall man lifted the queen.



The queen never acted sad for the horses, she seemed more annoyed by it, like when a dressmaker breaks a needle or a carpenter loses a hammer. Those horses had no names and died without any mourning from the owner. The ranger felt comfort that the bodies would feed the forest but a worry flooded his soul, ‚ÄòIf I had died here, would she have cared?‚Äô



""may as well carry you to the stone cercle if the horses are dead, a necromancer would be useful right now, had a uncal who was one until he died in a freak accident involving spoons"" the Queen was wearing fine silk and fur slippers, not fit for wading and trekking woodlands so the ranger thought he was right to do this.



But her form tensed at his bold handling, flashing with mingled irritation and amusement as his rough hands cupped her up with such ease.



""You northern barbarians truly have no sense of propriety,"" she scolded, though a secretive smile betrayed her as a spell applied her makeup and fixed her hair.



She adjusted her position in his arms, ""If you must grope your queen like a common tavern wench,"" Sylvara whispered against his ear, ""at least have the decency to do it properly.""



‚Äúwut?‚Äù replied the ranger.



‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù asked Sylvara, her pointed ears down like a cat that was found with a goldfish.



""the fuck dose propriety mean?"" he instantly asked in confusion once she stopped talking.



Sylvara's face filled with disbelief, her royal self cradled in the northerner's strong arms. Her elf lips parted in astonishment that this man who had demonstrated such savage cunning and surprising magical knowledge could be so utterly unrefined.



""Pro-prey‚Äôit\_ee,"" she enunciated slowly for him, ""refers to proper behavior befitting one's station. Something you northerners clearly lack.""



J would have left this racist elf in the woods if he wasn't a gentleman. And if she couldn't have him hunted down like a dog.¬†



Despite her words, her body pressed against his chest with each breath, her royal dignity nestling comfortably in his rough hands. ""Though I admit,"" Sylvara whispered, ""your barbaric ways have certain... advantages over courtly manners.""



""like how I'll carry you a whole day's walk?"" he asked with a laugh. ""Oh wait, I just need to pull my knives out of those demons right quick,"" it came to his mind that it was a day's travel by horse, with the queen in tow it'll be a day and a half or two before they get there.



She rolled those eyes with exasperation, bouncing slightly as his hold adjusted with the ranger‚Äôs grip. Her silver hair whipped across her face as she turned, glaring at him.



""Put me down, you uncouth oaf,"" she commanded with more words the ranger didn't fully know but had been called before, ""I am not some northern damsel to be carted about like luggage.""



Despite her protests, the queen remained nestled comfortably in his hand, ""The stone circle is still half a day's journey,"" (if they had a horse) Sylvara huffed, adjusting her torn lavender garments. ""I'll walk on my own feet, as unfitting it would be for an elf queen. Besides, your hands seem better suited for other tasks than carrying royalty."" Such as doing 80% of the work.



The ranger had picked up his knives with the queen in just one hand, ""you know carrying you really is no issue, you weigh bearly anything. It's like carrying 2 grapes‚Ä¶"" knives back in their places on his belt he adjusted to carry her with both arms again.



Her form notably heaved against his visby as her blackened elf lips curled into a snarl. ""Two grapes?"" Sylvara hissed while she struggled against his hold. ""I am Sylvara Vaelrinda, Queen of Mythralis, not some tall man peasant girl to be compared to fruit!"" Especially one so common and cheap as two grapes.



""Release me this instant,"" Sylvara commanded, though part of her that was more primal, an neglected part of Sylvara relished the northerner's irreverent strength. ""Or I shall demonstrate that arcane magic works quite effectively at close range.""



‚ÄòI could dodge it,‚Äô the thought passed J‚Äôs mind with whispers from the ancestors. But he still put her down politely while admitting, ""I'm sorry my queen‚Äù with a grin. ""yoo lead ill follow oh sylvara vaelrinda, queen of the elves who forget they live on bloody stolen land."" The ancestors took his voice in the last half.



Like a cat her eyes narrowed dangerously, her regal figure straightening to her full height. Her silver hair seemed to catch the breeze, floating slightly as arcane energy pulsed around her.



""Stolen land?"" she hissed in a snarl. ""The elves were walking these lands when your ancestors were still grunting in caves after that eventful twosday afternoon,‚Äù her mind raced for an insult, ‚Äúnortherner‚Ä¶""



The ritual component pulsed with energy, responding to her. Part of her aged mind recognized what she thought was his tactic. ‚Äòprovoking me to distract myself from wounded pride..‚Äô but her royal temper flared nonetheless.



""Follow if you must,"" Sylvara commanded, turning with regal grace despite her disheveled appearance. ""But mind your tongue, or I'll demonstrate precisely how effective an offensive spell can be against northern barbarians.""



J felt hurt, he felt the need to correct so much in what she said, ‚ÄúI have read enough history books to know all to well.. ‚Äù so he followed her with no witty comments. But he did enjoy the birds singing again. This will be a safe walk for a while.



The history of Bitu is strange, like most worlds, its history is not written by the Victors (despite common misunderstanding) but the history is written by book worms, nerds and bureaucrats whose job it is to write shit down.

Although kings, queens and other rich pricks have repeatedly had these works edited for silly and overall stupid reasons such as: teaching others to be racist, winning a one sided argument or most commonly to just pass on the blame for all the evil stuff they did for just as stupid reasons.

Most elf books written in and by elfs are like this actually, this was a big part in why Sylvara's world view was so conservative.



The world was small with a one sided history in her old eyes, everyone actually involved in her life was elf until the ranger.

Her royal court was mainly men, old elf men. Old by elf standards and so was their world views.



As Sylvara walked, she moved with the grace of a ballet dancer, despite her tattered robes. The silence between the queen and J stretched uncomfortably, filled only by the sounds of the forests and the sound of human feet crushing twigs and leaves.

Sylvara had spent most her life around silent servants and guards forbidden from talking to her. And yes men courtiers too filled with fear over titles to voice any real opinions.



J was not anything like that, and part of Sylvara, although she'd never admit it at the time, enjoyed his comments and opinions, she almost regretted ordering him silent as they walked the forest paths.



On all of the planet Bitu, the country of mythrails had the most largest forests, it was hard to tell where one started and the next ended, most rangers and elves just tried to pay attention to the types of trees and wildlife to know, everyone else struggled, got lost and eaten by wolves or mugged by highway men if no dragon is around to carry them off for dinner or as a bride.



Oh by the gods how Sylvara got bored, she hated how quiet it got without his narrations, she needed something to take her mind off of her worries about the quest, ""The history of these lands is... complicated,"" she finally admitted, thoughtfully manoeuvring her words, ""Many races have claimed dominion here across the millennials.""



The sunlight was filtered through ancient trees as she glanced back at him.

""Tell me, northerner,"" Sylvara asked with genuine curiosity, ""what stories do your people tell of the time before humans?"" such a loose question with a long answer.¬†



He bit on it like a hungry catfish. ""well first we tall men of the north are not pure human, we are part giant and dwarf so our history comes from 3 sides‚Ä¶."" J tried to explain with not the best success how migrations of populations lead to cultures evolving. But taken from her silence it wasn't what she wanted to know.



So he explained from a different angle ""Once upon a time, there was no time. There were also no Gods and no man or woman to walk the land. There was only the depths of the voidless sea and its dark, eternal inky quiet. Then a strain of melody moved across the endless black waters, a whisper first..."" J would go on for 3 hours perfectly recounting the written history of how the world of Bitu began, ‚Äú... The music was The Great Melody, C·õñ√≤·õö ·õó√≤·ö± and it grew into a great spiraling, gathering sound and momentum, reaching further and louder, building to a great crescendo until, where the sea met the land, an elder thing came to be born of white sea-foam. She was the first, and her name was Eiocha."" He'd read it so many times in so many different libraries by different people with their own theories he did mention as they came up.



‚ÄúThe Great Melody C·õñ√≤·õö ·õó√≤·ö±, did not cease with the initial creation. Many more came then, emerging out of the sound that was singing itself through the waters, one thing begetting another until, from an oak tree, Eiocha sprouted a plant which gave birth to the first God Danu.‚Äù



The tall man was just happy to talk about it to someone, normally when people ask him a question they ask him to stop answering but Sylvara just listened and seemed to have enjoyed the passion in which he spoke of such knowledge of the ancient world.



‚ÄúThey fucked and birthed more Gods, who felt lonely because they did not have anyone to be Godly over, so they sang and filled Bitu with life, but it was not enough so they each crafted a man and woman in their own image, dwarfs from stone, orks from beasts in the woods, gnomes from an old oak tree and lizardfolk from‚Ä¶ WeWell lizards‚Ä¶.‚Äù



‚ÄúGiants were born from when the off cuts and rubble of crafting was hurled into the water.‚Äù giants like elves were an accident by the gods, only one knows this, only one is not offended by this fact when they learn it.

‚ÄúThe Great Melody, in great delight, sang on, still singing today, filling Bitu for all those who can hear it with its divine harmony.‚Äù The tall man said so much more of it than this dear reader, but I struggle with the idea that you want to read it all.



Sylvara's wonderful eyes remained attentive throughout his lengthy historical exposition as they traveled, her own godly form occasionally shifting as they walked the forest paths as she absorbed his words with the patience only an ancient being could possess.



""Your knowledge surprises me,"" she admitted with an appreciative smile. ""Most humans I've encountered barely know their grandparents' tales, let alone cosmic creation myths.""



""Perhaps,"" Sylvara mused, slender fingers brushing a low-hanging branch from their path, ""this is why my scepter's magic responded to you. Your connection to ancient knowledge runs deeper than I first presumed.""



She cast a sideways glance at him, emerald eyes glinting with newfound respect.



That branch did swat his face after she let go.



But J felt he had to add, ""I'm nothing special my queen, my people like to rember as much history as we can. I am just a nerd as the humans of the east say.""



He did say this with a blush. ""most other humans I talk to barely let me even get to how the creator God of the elves tricked all the other God into letting him put his children anyway he wanted in the word."" Elf written books on the topic say it differently.



""I'd like to write a book about it maybe,"" the ranger shyly confessed to Sylvara, her regal features softened at this confession, ears relaxing slightly.



""A scholar disguised as a barbarian,"" she mused with that intrigued smile. ""How utterly surprising, I am sorry but..."" she contemplated his words, ‚ÄúI was expecting an old aged tale of the eventful twosday afternoon. Not well‚Ä¶‚Äù



""Perhaps,"" Sylvara suggested, her voice rich with royal authority, ""when this demon crisis has passed, I might commission such a book from you. The royal libraries of Mythralis would benefit from a northern perspective on our shared histories.""



J replied with a laugh, ""I'll title it ‚Äòhow the queen of knife ears got her tall man husband‚Äô"" he took note to look around seeing few if any birds or animals were around. A very happy squirrel with an apple, ‚Äòno demons here‚Äô¬†



The queen flashed with indignation at his crude joke, her ears stiffening as they snapped back, ""Mind your tongue, northerner,"" she hissed, forming a perfect scowl. ""I've not decided your fate yet.""



The ranger smiled as he kept his eyes away from the queen, his jokes so often went too far but he wasn't used to traveling with an elf woman. Ork and daughters of snow or other humans yes but never an elf woman.



The only other time he traveled with elves was with her guards. ‚ÄòOh god they were uncomfortable company, how can two men go so long without speaking? Were they even men? In armour elf men and women looked the same‚Ä¶.‚Äô Come to think of it J thought that just like dwarfs you couldn't really know until they told you their pronouns or got naked. Then again when naked, lizardfolk and boglings also look the same, mainly due to the lack of breasts or external genitals.



The long walk really made them both wish for a horse, the queen hopped the demons choked on their meat for making her walk so much, she did regret not letting J just carry her but her royal pride was too much to risk.



‚Äúwait stop‚Äù the ranger called, running to the side in such excitement.¬†



‚ÄòDemons? Bandits or some other danger?‚Äô The Queen‚Äôs mind raced with ideas over the issue that could take his attention away from her in such a rush he couldn't even‚Ä¶



It was a bush of berries, she had no idea if they were safe to eat but the ranger joyfully picked them and raced them to a pouch that folded out from his belt as he explained, ‚ÄúI only really leave settlements with 3 days worth of rations, you didn't pack any at all so I guess it's now 1 and a half da‚Ä¶ ‚Äú.¬†



The queen interrupted him ‚ÄúI hope you are not going to prolong our journey picking fruit everywhere we go?‚Äù



Somehow keeping total eye contact while saying, ‚Äúno‚Äù J only picked ten red berries.



He would later fill his forager pouch with flowers, herbs, nuts and seeds as he found them on this long walk. Each one met with more excitement. The queen at first found it annoying but the excitement in his voice as he listed the uses for mint and wild long onions was almost endearing.



‚ÄòHow can a man speak of poppy seeds and dandy lion roots the same way he spoke of Gods and long forgotten history?‚Äô All of the scholars or scribes in her court always seemed so bored with work, but here was this barbarian of the frozen norths who took so much excitement in finding a plant he had only read of but never seen in the wilds of his homeland. ‚ÄòAre all northerners like this or just him?‚Äô



‚ÄúIn a different life you could have been quite the scholar my ranger,‚Äù she giggled, letting that mask of queenliness slip, ‚Äúwhy didn't you dedicate yourself to learning?‚Äù she asked in that sweet sing-song voice.



The tall man of the north was left confused by the question and could only reply, ‚ÄúI'm poor, my family could never afford any real schooling. I'm lucky my mother could teach me to read and write, me and my family made some side money reading people's letters to them‚Ä¶‚Äù



The Queen did not enjoy this idea of the hard real world.



‚Äú...wed right letters for people too, helped me save up the money for a few books, lost them when some.‚Äù The ranger‚Äôs struggle with eye contact almost got worse as he spoke, ‚Äúsome ‚Äòless polite elfs‚Äô came to our village when I was young.‚Äù



Sylvara almost let her hand touch his face, ‚Äúlook some apples, I would..‚Äù she let her metaphysical mask all nobles who understand their job have, ‚ÄúI order you to get me a few Ranger.‚Äù



J smiled a toothy face at the elf, his teeth were made to cut, rip and tear, he put fear in the queen on some level she refused to listen to.



The ranger had no sword, and his pole arm was much shorter than any warrior from her armies, its head looked like a light axe with a sharp hook to it, she had seen what it could do to demons and how brutal a weapon it could be. The hook being on a four foot long pole was an almost perfect tool to pull down branches to pick apples or just cut them straight off the tree.



They were nothing like the apples in the palace but he gave her the nicest looking ones with eyes so pure and kind.



A rook landed near them as they ate. Singing an awful song and squawking.

‚ÄúReally doo go an.‚Äù the ranger said to the bird. Sylvara continued eating her red apple as J‚Ä¶



Talked to the birds? Squawk they'd go and he'd reply, ‚Äúno im not a hunter and plan on eating no meat from here today.‚Äù the one sided conversion seemed almost intriguing to the queen, squawk would call out the rook and the tall man would ‚Äòanswer?‚Äô ‚Äúwell if I did, tell him he can eat my eyes and enslave my soul to any mushrooms he needs tending.‚Äù



The bird flew off, ‚ÄúIm sorry but hunting any fresh game for meals is out of the question today.‚Äù J explained to the queen, she almost wished he'd never do anything that silly and out of place again, but more corvids came as they walked, each one he took turns talking to over and over, giving them a few of the nuts and seeds he had like the mad man he was.



But just as fast the birds came, they left in a startled panic, Sylvara heard it first, her pointed ears picked in reaction to the upcoming danger, as the sounds of panting, claws scraping on the ground and foliage giving way to a pack of wolves.



The Queen silver hair waved as her scepter plused with her mana, she had started to prepare a set of combat spells. But it was too late, the wolves came close snarling teeth far more sharp than the humans.



Sylvara's spell was about to come forth in defence but J did what any crazy mountain man would. And got in the way of her clear line of sight.



‚Äúoh aren't you beautiful ya grand beasties?‚Äù J let out in a gasp, a small echo to his words as he slowly walked up to the biggest of the pack and slowly ever so slowly reached and petted it on the head.

Sylvara thought he'd draw a blade, chop the head off like from the legends and stories of heroes but no, ‚Äúhere you go ya wee hun, a mother needs to eat.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou simply can not be feeding the wolves?‚Äù the regal elf asked as her silk-like hair fell back down, ‚Äúthat is a wild animal and not someone's pet or a person.‚Äù



The ranger looked over his pauldron at the bewildered woman, the resting panic in her eyes matched the look she held back at the temple, but the ranger simply did not have the skills to realise, ‚Äúwhat you mutterin? Look she's my friend.‚Äù the ranger fed the beast more of his dry meat rations with an open hand.



Sylvara's brain took a longer time to process those words, a lot longer than normal for her, that part of your mind that decides what is silly, what is absurd or just normal was burning itself out and generating a reddening headache for the elf as she tried to apply all 1501 years of her life time of experiences to this current event.



‚Äúwhy are you‚Ä¶.‚Äù her mind quickly redecided better words, less hurtful, ‚Äúthat's a beat, wild and dangerous! Not a friend of yours!‚Äù concern, fear and judgement were the set cocktail of feelings her elf mind decided on in the end.



The ranger pointed the down the path, the way they had came, he spoke the north tongue to the wolves, ‚ÄúD√† ·õñ·ö®c·ö∫ ·õó·ö®·ö±·õí·ö∫ ·õä·õÅ·ö®·ö± ·ö®·õÅ·ö± ·ö®·öæ ·õä·õñ·õü.‚Äù The words lost to the Queen but the wolves ran off the way he told them to.



He stood to his full height, matching the queen's, looking eye to eye he spoke in elf, ‚Äúiff knot friend why friend shape?‚Äù He was not good at speaking any elf made dialects.



But Sylvara found herself smiling, maybe she had been driven mad by the ranger or maybe a new part of her woke up and saw him, and for a small instant she took on a view of almost how he looked at the world for a moment. It was refreshing.



Back in her 90 years of schooling, the elf had read much about the world. It was commonly written that users of nature magic such as druids, witches and rangers spoke to animals and trees but to see it happen is a lot less impressive than the queen was expecting it to be.

‚ÄúTrees doont talk back, thats utter nun-sense.‚Äù he explained to her after she brought up the subject as they walked besides one another.

  


J ran his fingers through his woolly red hair, his green eyes focused on the setting sun. ‚Äúbest we set op camp Sylvara, try nd arrange some rocks in a big circle and build a fire,‚Äù J almost ordered as he held his hand to the sky. The queen didn't recognise that the ranger was telling time. two fingers, enough time to set up but not teach setting up while setting up.



The Queen's eyes widened and her eartips rose, whatever it was nobles did to put out that air of ‚ÄòI'm in charge‚Äô she doubled it, ‚Äúyou northerners can't truly think you can just order a queen around like a servant?‚Ä¶.‚Äù



J cut her off with his coarse northlands accent, ‚ÄúI‚Äôdid-nt order ya, I just said and asked,‚Äù he took out a large terr√≠cola jar of salt out of his pack, it didn't look like something that could really fit, ‚Äúsorry my queen but the sun has aboot 3 hours left, and we need ta set up a place to sleep, be warm and‚Ä¶ ‚Äú



Her form shifted its weight as she walked up to him and that jar, her emerald eyes burning like witch fire ‚Äúso just set up camp and you little stove like the temple.‚Äù She did order.



But J walked while pouring a thick line of salt that smelled of rich perfumes, he was tired from met-er-for-ic-ly carrying the queen and their things, ‚Äúdemons ma queen, demons.‚Äù These words made her go and stay quiet. ‚ÄùWe are nut in ah temple, we are in ta middle of the woods, salt keeps away demons. The fire will stoop us from dieing from the cold and keep away any beasties I can't make friends with.‚Äù



Sylvara did not reply to this, just went to get rocks and sticks. The ranger lived outside, technically she was still a guest in his home.

She didn't want to get dirty so simply casted a small spell to pick up and move the stones, rocks and sticks. She started her way back to J after she found an old log.



She wasn't expecting him to be surprised by the log but his face lit up with joy by her use of magic, ‚Äúsee? can't do that spell with nature magic,‚Äù he said smiling, ‚ÄúI finished ta circle and started dinner while you where busy .‚Äù



He cleared a space of leaves and plants, ‚Äòfire here‚Äô he wrote in the dirt.

Dinner was a tin plate with nuts and seeds laid on it with cut up meat rations.



Sylvara placed the stones and wood in a tidy pile where the human marked. He patted her head and whispered, ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù before getting to cooking the food and boiling tea.



Sylvara sat in the tent, ‚Äúdid you put all the leaves under the bed roll?‚Äù ‚ÄòWhy did he?‚Äô



A giggle left him as he told her ‚Äúduse her magisty still feel de pea? I just wanted yoo ta have a more comfy bed.‚Äù



The queen never thought of this.

Part of her was worried about shearing the tent with the ranger again.



He gave her the plate, ‚Äúplease eat what you need, I'll have the rest‚Äù . The plate was blackened in places from the fire and still hot but on it was almost a roasted salad. Set with sheep sorrel, poppy seeds, rehydrated meat and root nuts. Followed by a cup of tea, mint and chamomile.



The meat was strange and rubber like but the queen did quietly try to enjoy the meal as she laid in his tent, ‚ÄúI forgot to say thank you my ranger.‚Äù This was nothing like the palace but it was nice in a different way.



He sat by the fire, writing and smoking while they still had some dieing sunlight, ‚Äúyou are a queen, and I am just a dirty barberian‚Ä¶‚Äù He joked looking her up and down as his strange quill made its way over the parchment, ‚ÄúI'm a ranger, we dont get thanks or rewards often.‚Äù He said with smoke in his mouth, his little pipe looked like a tiny hollowed out skull on a stick.



The queen ate only a third of the plate, ‚ÄúI've had enough, you may eat now ranger.‚Äù She pushed the plate away from herself, ‚Äúbut could I have a second cup of tea?‚Äù¬†



J didn't speak, he took the plate and poured the tea until the cup was full.

His journal went back in his pack before we started eating and drinking his small shear of the tea. He drank it from the kettle and completely ruined the image he had made for the queen in the setting sunlight.



Sylvara felt her heartbeat as her eyes narrowed, her sing-song voice let out a small question ‚Äúwill you be sharing a bed with me again ranger?‚Äù¬†



As the sky changed ownership and only moonlights was over their little campsite, she could only see J in colour by the fire, ‚Äúmy queen it'll be a dry night so I'll sleep by the fire under my cloak. It's also my blanket, so it's OK.‚Äú

After he finished eating, the tall man left the plate on the fire's edge, laying down. Still looking at the queen.¬†

‚ÄúThe salt cuircal will keep demons out for the night, but wake me for anything that can get past it.‚Äù



The queen couldn't help but chuckle, her eyes flickering in the fire light, ‚Äúdo you in the north have stories of when you first went north?‚Äù¬†



J told her the story. And enjoyed telling her the story. She may by all recorded history of Bituof been the first elf from the royal family to hear it. She was the first elf who asked to hear it.



That ring of hers, it was so cold on her finger when J spoke to her, on the rare moment Sylvara could talk to her husband it would feel quite warm and her wedding ring heavy.

1mujfis,https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1mujfis/how_to_maintain_your_brand_with_your_existing/,How to maintain your brand with your EXISTING connections on Linkedin,"Noticed that a lot of CEO's, business owner's are short on time and don't necessarily have the time to build their brand on linkedin. So figured I'd just lay it out here.

So why Linkedin?

* The most underrated part of LI is not to gain new customers / clients, but to stay on top of mind with your existing connections (ie. the ones you have a REAL relationship with).
* This is especially applicable to those that don't necessarily have time to go out and network their existing relationships - grab a coffee with an acquaintance, a prospect, and strengthen your network. We only have so much time during the day and on top of that, you are building your business.
* Here's a practical example with a client of mine in the Engineering industry. He has dinners and lunches with prospective clients who happen to be overseas. These dinners are great, both have a good time and finish with a promising handshake.
* Now maybe 2-3 months later, the prospect requires my client's services but he doesn't think of him immediately. Instead, he thinks of the neighboring engineering consultancy a few floors below.
* He sees their logo every morning when he walks past the building lobby. They happen to be more mentally available than my client, who he had dinner with one month ago.
* This is not a comparison of competency, price or services - this is a comparison of mental availability.

How would you do it

1. Get interviewed on a monthly basis for at least 1-2 hours. It could be on a podcast, it could be hiring your own personal interviewer. The latter makes more sense. For podcast, you would have to be invited regularly or create your own, so that may be additional headaches you don't need - so I recommend hiring someone that interviews you.
2. Share all stories, opinions, trends or whatever that you want to share with the interviewer
3. Interviewer will minute the meeting and use the notes to write out 10-15 Linkedin posts that you can post 2 x a week, where you literally copy and paste. Wouldn't be more than a few minutes a week.

This sounds pretty straightforward, but there are few important notes to make the most of it:

* It cannot be Linkedin Slop - ie. the excess use of emoji's, hyphens and just exaggerated language. This will hurt your personal brand. Make you come across as lazy, salesy and creates a bad impression amongst your network.
* Your interviewer must be GREAT. My personal favourite / inspiration for interview style is Michael Parkinson. He has this ability to bring his guests out of their shells and get them to share compelling stories, essentailly bring the best out of his guests - their charisma, their expertise, their experience. And these need to be articulated into engaging online content.

Now if you do this well, you re-use the same content across different platforms such as IG, Tiktok and use different forms of content, such as quotes (similar to the motivational content you see on IG), digital twins, or even just snippets of your interview. You create a content machine.

Now, I don't think this is for everyone as some are really really good at managing relationships, but probably better for others who want something that's a bit more passive.",1,1755612394.0,linkedin,0,1.0,False

1mujerg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mujerg,help with small living room/kitchen space!,"recently moved into this apartment with my boyfriend, so we have kind of a jumbled combination of furniture and design tastes. we are renting, so fairly limited with what we can do. but i am truly desperate for advice with our teeny tiny kitchen/living space, as I‚Äôve decided that it truly makes me feel so uncomfortable in my own home. For context, the entire room is approximately 15‚Äôx15‚Äô.

Non negotiables for my boyfriend are the couch and the records/Paramore poster.

I am pretty open to whatever, but I really just can‚Äôt continue living with the way that it is for the entirety of our lease.

The only thing that I know for certain is that the space is very very dark and we get limited natural light. Also that the coffee table is way too small. Any help at all would be majorly appreciated!

Since we‚Äôre both hopeless coffee addicts, of course we brought our portable espresso makers. I had my Outin Nano, he brought his Wacaco Picopresso.  
  
Early morning rolls around. I barely sit up, grab my Outin, pour in some cold water, drop in a capsule, press the button‚Ä¶ and then just go back to scrolling on my phone while it heats itself.  
  
Meanwhile, Lucas is already doing a full-on ritual‚Ä¶ build a fire, boil water, pour it into a thermos, grind the beans, tamp, load, then manually pump out the espresso‚Ä¶ you get the idea.  
  
Minutes later he‚Äôs still pumping and goes, ‚ÄúDude, can I borrow your fire? My water went cold‚Ä¶‚Äù üòÇ  
  
By noon I wanted to switch flavors, so I swapped the capsule for some grounds, hit the button again, and boom, another espresso. Lucas just looked at me and said, ‚ÄúOkay that‚Äôs just not fair‚Äù haha  
  
When it came time to pack up, I wiped my Outin with a wet wipe and called it a day. Lucas was still elbow-deep in parts, scrubbing and rinsing.  
  
To be fair, his Picopresso can pull a nice shot, and maybe he enjoys the routine of it all. But when I‚Äôm half-asleep in the woods, I‚Äôm not trying to play ‚Äúmini barista.‚Äù Having just one button, easy cleanup, and more time to actually enjoy the outdoors is a win in my book.

1muj6zq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1muj6zq/should_you_try_the_best_cold_brew_coffee_maker/,Should you try the best cold brew coffee maker OXO Good Grips,"OXO 1272880 has been quite the addition to my kitchen countertop. This sleek cold brew coffee maker had me curious, and as someone who‚Äôs passionate about a good cup of coffee, I had to give it a deeper dive. It's advertised as a tool to simplify the cold brew process, and spoiler alert‚ÄîI think it delivers on many fronts. However, like everything, it‚Äôs not without its minor quirks.

**Sleek Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the first impression is how modern and functional the coffee maker looks. With a combination of stainless steel, silicone, borosilicate glass, and some high-quality plastic, it felt sturdy but not overly heavy. The 32-ounce capacity fits perfectly into my daily coffee-making routine, while still being compact enough to sit neatly on my kitchen counter without taking up too much space. I especially appreciated the borosilicate glass carafe with its measurement markings; it‚Äôs a thoughtfully included touch that eliminates guesswork when portioning out concentrate.  

**Brewing Process Made Simple**  
Making cold brew with this device brought a new level of simplicity. Adding coffee grounds to the machine, pouring water over, and letting the Rainmaker feature evenly distribute the liquid was oddly satisfying. The steeping part, though, does require patience as the magic happens overnight. But honestly, waking up to filtered coffee concentrate ready to use made mornings smoother. The ultra-fine stainless steel mesh filter was particularly impressive, catching all those tiny coffee particles. Plus, the reusable filter means I don‚Äôt have to stock up on paper filters, reducing waste.

- The Rainmaker evenly distributes water over the coffee grounds, ensuring great flavor extraction.  
- Carafe measurement markings are highly convenient for portion control.  
- It comes apart easily for cleaning and nests compactly, which was key in a storage-challenged kitchen.  
- The silicone-covered stopper tightly seals the carafe for freshness, keeping concentrate usable for several days.  
- Offers versatility, as I‚Äôve also tried brewing tea with it‚Äîand yes, it performed well.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- It‚Äôs a little time-consuming, as cold brewing naturally takes longer. If you‚Äôre impatient, this might not be ideal.  
- Cleaning the ultra-fine mesh filter thoroughly is necessary to avoid buildup, but it could be a bit fussy for those who don‚Äôt enjoy scrubbing.  
- Although well-built, the plastic components might not feel premium enough for some users.  
- The need for assembly when first setting it up may require careful attention, especially for people not familiar with similar items.  

**Other Options**  
While this coffee maker has its perks, I‚Äôve had the chance to test other cold brew systems like the Toddy Cold Brew System and the Hario Mizudashi. The Toddy provides comparable concentrate output but lacks the sleek design and smaller footprint of this one. Hario, on the other hand, is more elegant but slightly messier to clean. I found the OXO model strikes a nice balance between functionality and aesthetics compared to these rivals.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Reflecting on its quality and convenience, the price point, while not the cheapest, justifies what you get. The reusable components, overall convenience, and durability make it a smart choice for regular cold brew enthusiasts. It easily beats frequenting coffee shops if you‚Äôre someone who craves cold brew daily.

It is the summer of 2035.
Maya steps out of her apartment onto a humming New York street. The air is heavy with the scent of roasted coffee and exhaust fumes, but she barely notices. Her headphones are alive. They do not play an album or shuffle through a playlist; they listen to her, her footsteps, her breathing, her heart rate, even the micro-fluctuations in her voice when she greeted her neighbor in the hallway.

As she walks, the music shifts in real time. A pulsing bassline rises to match her stride. When the traffic light stalls her at the corner, the rhythm softens, overlaying a wash of strings that feels like an exhale. Across the street, a street performer strums a guitar, and her system captures the sound, weaving it, instantly, into her personal soundtrack. The guitar riff loops, transforms, harmonizes with a melody that wasn‚Äôt there seconds before. It is as if the city itself is composing for her.

This is not a playlist. It is not even a song, in the traditional sense. It is an ongoing, adaptive score to her life. And it belongs only to her. No one else in the crowd hears what she hears. The soundtrack is uniquely hers, co-composed by algorithms, environmental sensors, and the moods she doesn‚Äôt fully articulate but that her devices know better than she does.

Maya wonders, though: is this music hers? She didn‚Äôt write the notes. She didn‚Äôt play an instrument. Yet she feels deeply involved in its making, her choices, her body, her context are the raw material.

This vision is both exhilarating and unsettling. For centuries, music has been something we listen to, performed by others. What happens when the line between creator and listener dissolves? What happens when music is no longer something we consume, but something we co-create, minute by minute, with machines?

## A Brief History of Music Technology

To understand the radical promise of music in the age of artificial intelligence, it helps to look backward. Every major leap in music technology has reshaped the relationship between artists and audiences, turning private expressions into public commodities and, in some cases, altering how we imagine music itself.

The phonograph, introduced by Thomas Edison in 1877, was more than an invention. It was a revolution in perception. For the first time, music was not confined to the ephemeral moment of performance. A voice, a piano, an orchestra, sounds once destined to vanish into the air, could be captured and replayed. Suddenly, listeners could consume music on demand. The artist no longer had to be physically present.

The 20th century saw radio turn music into a mass broadcast, reaching millions simultaneously. The intimacy of listening alone in one‚Äôs living room was paradoxically shared by strangers across a nation. Records, cassettes, and compact discs added portability and personal libraries, granting listeners more control over what they played, when, and how often. Each new medium shifted the balance: from artist-centered performance to user-centered consumption.

The digital revolution accelerated this shift. MP3s compressed sound into packets that could travel the internet. Napster, and later iTunes, reshaped the industry not by changing music itself, but by changing its distribution. Suddenly, ownership of music became fluid, contested, and, often, free.

Streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube carried this to its logical conclusion. Music was no longer a possession but an endless, subscription-based flow. Algorithms curated what we heard. Listeners gained unprecedented access to the world‚Äôs music catalog, while artists grappled with new forms of visibility and vanishing royalties.

Yet, through all these changes, one thing remained: the music itself was pre-composed. Whether pressed onto vinyl, burned into CDs, or streamed in digital packets, the track was fixed. The listener could shuffle or skip, but not transform. The creative act remained on one side of the glass.

Artificial intelligence promises to break this century-long convention. For the first time, the act of listening can become the act of making. Just as the phonograph dissolved the limits of time and space, AI may dissolve the boundary between artist and audience.

## Today‚Äôs Landscape: The Dawn of Machine Musicianship

We are already living in the prologue of this future. AI-driven music is no longer speculative. It is quietly weaving itself into daily life.

Generative algorithms, trained on vast datasets of recorded music, can now produce original compositions in a fraction of a second. Companies like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and startups across the globe have built models capable of generating jazz solos, symphonies, ambient soundscapes, and pop songs. While critics argue about quality and originality, the fact remains: machines can now compose.

The most common entry point has been personalization. Streaming platforms use machine learning to generate ‚ÄúDiscover Weekly‚Äù playlists or mood-based mixes. But these are still static, curated collections of existing tracks. More radical experiments lie elsewhere.

Meditation apps, for example, increasingly use AI to build adaptive soundscapes. Instead of looping the same ten ‚Äúcalm piano‚Äù tracks, they generate infinite variations in real time, tuned to the user‚Äôs breathing or heart rate. The soundtrack becomes an extension of the body‚Äôs rhythms.

Video games provide another glimpse. In titles like No Man‚Äôs Sky or Red Dead Redemption 2, music is no longer a background loop but a dynamic score. As players explore or shift behaviors, the soundtrack morphs seamlessly, rising in tension during a battle, softening as the player rests by a virtual fire. These systems rely on algorithmic generation, hinting at how adaptive scoring might enter everyday life.

Even fitness platforms experiment with ‚Äúsmartq playlists‚Äù that adjust tempo to match a runner‚Äôs pace. Some devices already integrate biometric sensors, meaning the soundtrack doesn‚Äôt just accompany activity, it actively nudges performance, like a coach disguised as a melody.

These are still early steps. The technology remains bounded by familiar categories: playlists, genres, moods. But the logic is shifting. Instead of music as a fixed artifact, we are seeing music as a process, a living, adaptive system.

Importantly, this shift reframes what it means to be a musician. If a jogger can summon a personalized symphony simply by running faster, where does the composer end and the listener begin? If an ambient soundtrack adjusts automatically to match a user‚Äôs stress levels, who authored it?

For now, these questions remain at the margins. Most people still listen to songs on Spotify, still go to concerts, still hum along to the radio. But beneath this surface, a paradigm is emerging. The future of music is less about owning tracks and more about inhabiting soundscapes. Less about replaying someone else‚Äôs creation and more about co-authoring the moment.

In other words, the future of music may not arrive as a new album or artist, it may arrive as an interface.

## The Listener Becomes the Composer

Imagine a teenager in 2040. She has never touched a guitar, cannot read sheet music, and yet she is a composer. On her morning commute, she whispers into her earbud: ‚ÄúSomething hopeful, with a little bit of rain in it.‚Äù The system parses her request, blending piano chords with synthetic droplets, wrapping them into a rhythm that matches the train‚Äôs sway. She saves the track, not as a finished song, but as a seed that she can return to, refine, and share.

This is the promise of AI-driven composition: a democratization of music-making on a scale comparable to what smartphone cameras did for photography. A century ago, capturing a photo required expensive equipment and technical expertise. Today, billions of people make and share images daily. Photography is no longer reserved for professionals; it is part of everyday self-expression.

Music may follow a similar path. AI interfaces can translate vague, emotional prompts into sonic forms. You might hum a fragment, describe a mood, or simply allow sensors to detect your physiology. The system does the rest, generating a soundscape tailored to your input.

Some prototypes already exist. Voice-controlled assistants can generate beats or melodies on demand. Startups are building platforms where users sketch a rhythm with taps, and the AI fills in harmonies, textures, and polish. Others imagine wearable devices that track galvanic skin response or brainwave activity, shaping music around emotional states in real time.

The key is that users do not need technical mastery. You don‚Äôt need to know how to orchestrate strings or program synthesizers. The AI becomes both teacher and collaborator, handling the complexity while leaving room for creative choice.

This raises profound cultural possibilities. If anyone can compose, music becomes less about broadcast fame and more about intimate self-expression. Your soundtrack may never top a chart, but it may deepen your morning walk, soothe your anxiety, or accompany your child‚Äôs bedtime.

Critics may call this ‚Äúdilution,‚Äù arguing that lowering barriers diminishes artistry. But history suggests otherwise. The printing press did not kill literature; it expanded literacy. The smartphone did not kill photography; it created new genres, from selfies to citizen journalism. Democracies of expression do not erase excellence, they multiply it.

The real revolution may not be in the music itself, but in the role of the listener. The line between audience and artist, long guarded, begins to dissolve. You are no longer merely consuming culture. You are composing it, even if only for yourself.

This participatory shift also changes how we imagine ownership. If your AI-generated soundtrack emerges from your mood, is it ‚Äúyours‚Äù? If you share it and others adapt it, is it still ‚Äúyours‚Äù? Authorship becomes less a signature and more a conversation, a continual remix of human intention and machine assistance.

In this sense, the listener as composer does not simply signal a new toolset. It signals a new cultural logic: one where music is not a product to be bought and sold, but a process to be lived.

## Cultural & Artistic Implications

The rise of co-created music poses some of the most provocative cultural questions of our time. At stake is not only the future of an industry, but the very meaning of creativity, authenticity, and community.

First, authorship. Who is the artist when music is algorithmically generated? Traditional frameworks assume a composer writes, a performer interprets, and an audience listens. But in an AI-mediated world, these roles blur. If you instruct an AI to generate a melody, are you the composer, or is the model? Is the company that trained the AI the true author, or are the countless anonymous musicians whose recordings were used to train it the invisible co-writers?

Second, cultural touchstones. Shared songs have long been a glue of collective identity. The Beatles in the 1960s, hip-hop in the 1980s, K-pop in the 2010s, each era had its anthems, its moments of mass synchronization. What happens when music becomes hyper-personalized? If everyone hears a different soundtrack, do we lose the common ground of humming the same tune? Or do new forms of collectivity emerge, not around fixed songs, but around experiences of making and sharing?

Third, authenticity. Much of music‚Äôs power comes from the sense that it expresses human experience. A blues singer‚Äôs wail, a folk ballad passed down generations, these resonate because they carry stories. Can AI-generated compositions convey the same weight? Or will they always feel hollow, simulations of expression rather than expressions themselves?

Skeptics argue that AI lacks soul, that creativity without suffering or desire is mimicry. But others counter that authenticity lies not in the origin but in the reception. If a piece of music moves you, if it makes you cry, dance, or remember, does it matter whether a human or an algorithm composed it? After all, we routinely find meaning in nature‚Äôs sounds, the crash of waves, the chirping of birds, without demanding human authorship.

Finally, the economics. Industries will adapt, as they always have. Some professional musicians may see their roles diminish, much as scribes gave way to printing presses. But new roles will also emerge: curators of AI tools, designers of interactive soundscapes, creators of hybrid performances where human musicians improvise alongside adaptive algorithms. Just as DJs transformed the role of the musician by manipulating recorded tracks, tomorrow‚Äôs artists may specialize in guiding, remixing, and co-performing with machines.

We may also see a shift in cultural status. The greatest prestige may not belong to those who produce fixed albums, but to those who design systems that enable millions of unique personal compositions. The artist as architect of possibility, rather than deliverer of product.

At a deeper level, this transformation forces us to rethink what music is for. Is it primarily a commodity to be sold? A communal ritual? A tool for self-regulation of mood and identity? The answer may be: all of the above, but in shifting proportions.

In this future, music is no longer a static artifact but a living medium of interaction, between humans, between humans and machines, between individuals and their environments. It becomes less about permanence and more about presence. Less about owning songs and more about living inside sound.

And in that shift, music may return to something ancient. Long before records and radio, music was always participatory: people singing together around fires, working songs, lullabies. The age of AI may paradoxically bring us back to that origin, not by erasing technology, but by dissolving the barrier between artist and listener.


---

## **Epilogue: The Soundtrack of Tomorrow**

The future of music may not arrive with a single breakthrough, but with a gradual seepage into everyday life. One day, the idea of listening to a static album may feel as quaint as winding a cassette tape with a pencil. Our descendants might wonder what it was like to live in an age when music came only in fixed, one-size-fits-all units, when the same three-minute track repeated identically for every listener, in every mood, in every circumstance.

In its place will be a culture of fluid sound. Each of us will carry our own evolving symphonies, not frozen in time but adapting moment to moment. Music will listen back. It will anticipate, respond, and accompany us, blurring the line between soundtrack and self.

This does not mean the end of artistry or community. Just as the printing press did not end poetry, and photography did not end painting, AI will not end music. It will multiply its forms. There will still be concerts and stars, still be songs we share collectively, still be anthems that define generations. But alongside these will be new, quieter revolutions: parents composing bedtime soundscapes for their children, teenagers remixing moods into identity, workers orchestrating their focus through adaptive beats.

The central shift is one of agency. Music has always shaped us, lifting us, soothing us, rallying us, but rarely have we shaped it in return. Now we stand at the threshold of a participatory era, where listening itself is a creative act.

This era will bring challenges: questions of authorship, authenticity, equity. But it will also bring extraordinary possibilities: soundscapes as personal as fingerprints, collaborations between human imagination and machine intelligence, and a return to music as an everyday practice of living, not just a product to be consumed.

Perhaps, then, the future of music is not about replacing the human with the artificial, but about rediscovering what it means to be human, through sound that adapts, evolves, and resonates with the shifting rhythms of our lives.

In the end, music‚Äôs future may echo its past: not something we own, but something we inhabit. A living, breathing presence that accompanies us, not as background noise, but as co-creator of our stories.

1muj3xl,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEarReviews/comments/1muj3xl/explore_the_best_coffee_maker_features_in_keurig/,Explore the Best Coffee Maker Features in Keurig K-Duo Review,"The Keurig K-Duo Special Edition has been my coffee companion for weeks now, and it‚Äôs given me plenty to think about. As someone who loves both the ritual of brewing a carafe and the convenience of single-serve coffee, it seemed like this versatile coffee maker would tick all the boxes. It does a lot well, but there are a few quirks worth discussing. Let's get into the details and unpack what‚Äôs good‚Äîand what‚Äôs not so great‚Äîabout this machine.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek silver finish on the Keurig K-Duo Special Edition immediately stands out on my kitchen counter. It‚Äôs modern, streamlined, and fits neatly into small spaces despite its fairly significant 12.76-inch depth. The shared 60 oz. water reservoir for both the single-serve option and the 12-cup carafe is a smart design choice, saving time and reducing the hassle of constant refilling. That removable reservoir is a feature I never knew I needed until I experienced how simple it made cleaning and refilling. The metallic handle on the included glass carafe adds a touch of class, though I have to admit it‚Äôs a bit heavy when full. Overall, it looks premium, but the plastic components feel slightly less impressive than the exterior would suggest.

**Performance**  
Once you get past the aesthetics, the way this coffee maker performs is where things truly get interesting. The inclusion of both ground coffee and K-Cup compatibility is a game-changer for households with varied coffee preferences. I can make myself a quick 10 oz. cup during rushed mornings, while on weekends, I love to savor a freshly brewed 8-cup carafe. The Strong Brew feature is a personal favorite; I‚Äôm a fan of bold, intense coffee, and this option delivers just that. It‚Äôs a little slower than the regular brewing mode, but well worth the wait.

[Check Keurig K-Duo Special Edition price on Amazon.](https://sohdu.com/p/b095xdqpzc/)

**Features and Settings**  
The programmable carafe auto-brew function is ideal for those like me who aren‚Äôt fully functional until caffeine kicks in. Setting up the timer for a pot of coffee 24 hours in advance has been effortless, and waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee feels luxurious. The Pause & Pour feature is another welcome addition, letting me sneak in a quick pour while the pot is still brewing. It heats up quickly with the Smart Start feature, and there‚Äôs little waiting time between brewing cycles.

One minor drawback in functionality is the temperature of the coffee from single-serve mode, which isn‚Äôt always as piping hot as I‚Äôd like. However, the carafe seems to retain the heat better, especially with its heating plate.

**Pluses**  
- Dual brewing system for both K-Cups and ground coffee  
- Strong Brew function for a bolder flavor  
- 60 oz. removable water reservoir simplifies refilling  
- Programmable timer for the carafe  

**Flaws**  
- Single-serve coffee‚Äôs temperature could be hotter  
- Some plastic parts feel less sturdy  
- Water reservoir placement can be challenging to access in tight spaces  

**Challengers**  
In comparison to similar products like the Ninja Specialty Coffee Maker or Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, this Keurig model strikes a nice balance between convenience and capability. The Ninja offers better build quality and versatility in terms of specialty coffee brewing, but it might be overwhelming for someone looking for simplicity. Meanwhile, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew also combines single-serve and carafe options but lacks the polish and sleek touch seen in this design. Where the Keurig excels is its straightforward, user-friendly operation and compact footprint.

**Value Proposition**  
For what it offers, I do think this coffee maker provides a good value. It‚Äôs not the cheapest option on the market but packs in several features that justify its cost, especially for someone who switches between single-serve and carafe coffee daily. If you love having strong coffee, programmable brewing, or the flexibility of using both pods and grounds‚Äîthis is an investment worth considering.

I [22F] like this guy [25m] from our church since 2017. He was my light group head back then. Fell for him because, for some reason, he just knows the right things to say. he became an image of god for me here on earth.

I started going to our youth gathering in January 2017. However, i was only active for around 3 months. our youth group had a camp back then that i cannot attend because we had no money for it. with that, i just felt shy going back to the group after since i thought i'd be left out. but afterwards, i was still attending maybe once a month or once every 2 months. pandemic happened, and i entered college already, so i wasnt able to attend at all for several years. but i'd still go to our church every week, but not the youth gathering.

i've been meaning to go, not because of him (okay maybe partly), but since i know that it is one of the reasons why i built a stronger connection with god.

fast forward to my 4th year in college (around november 2024), he suddenly started interacting with my ig stories and posts. he would reply or like them. there were several days he would message daily. he then invited me to a coffee pop up by his friend. i came, of course, but was there for only a few minutes because i had to meet my friends afterwards. and frankly because my body was shaking badly because hey that's my crush! and for some reason, after that day, the messages and interactions significantly lessened. i am honestly not sure what ive done, but it's fine for me. we would still interact with one another now and then but very limited.

fast forward to few months after (april 2025), there was another youth camp! this year, i really told myself that i should go already. i'm already 22 and is about to graduate college so i had to go to that camp. not because of him, but because i know i would get to know god deeper there. i'm scared that if i did not attend this year, i may not be eligible anymore in the coming years because im technically not a youth anymore lol. before signing up, i messaged him to ask if there were also first time camp attendees that are already in their 20s just like me. he validated me that yes there are, so that gave me the confidence to sign up. mind you, prior to this, we would still send each other random reels very seldom tho. he also invited me to go to the monthly coffee pop up by his friend too.

came camp, i had the best days of my life. on the last day, i came up to him to hug and tell him, ""thank you for not being a stranger all these years. let's push through with that coffee please"" he said sure.

it has been months, and for some reason, he never sent any reel anymore and would often ignore mine. which btw was fine with me, i was never entitled to any response i know!! and i don't really want to be a burden.

almost end of july 2025, i saw in his ig note he wrote, ""should i ask her out?"" which may just confirm that he already has a special someone. don't get me wrong, i am very happy for him. i aspire nothing but his happiness. i just brushed it off. few days later, while casually scrolling through ig reels, i saw a post by a girl where she and him went out. hehe maybe she was the girl he was referring to in his ig note. upon further investigation, i learned that they were childhood friends. i also get why he may develop feelings for the girl‚Äî basing on her posts, she is very matured, intelligent, kind, god-fearing, and very pretty.

last sunday, i served in church taking pictures. he was there too. i greeted him happily and asked how he was. every thing should be normal. he is completely unaware of my feelings, and he is not responsible with me in any way. so i should really act casual. i was packing my things when he came to me, we had a short conversation. he even offered a ride to the cafe where the youth group would be hanging out after service, which i gladly agreed to. in the cafe, he sat next to me and we (along with other youth) had conversations and games. it was definitely fun. i accidentally glanced on his phone one time and saw that he was sending a photo to someone. i did not saw who it really was but saw that the icon was mostly white. when we got home, i saw that the icon kinda resembles the icon of the girl that posted the reel. this just confirmed to me more that they may be dating or talking already.

i know i do not have any right in this situation. i'm just a girl who has been secretly liking him lol. my friends told me several times already to confess my feelings for him. but i know for a fact that if that feelings are reciprocated, he would have told me already. but no, so i can confirm that this is all just me lol. and that's fine, i just have to find a way to move on already. god it has been more than 8 years ready. please don't get me wrong, i am truly happy for him if he ends up with the girl. they deserve each other, and actually they look like a perfect match.

i just need to ask for advice on how i should move on. i think this is harder that moving on from a relationship, because i know that there was nothing to begin with lol. at least when you end a relationship, you both know that you have to stay away from each other and that you tried yet things just doesn't work out. i just can't find a handbook that tells me ways on how i should move on from a guy in this situation lol. knowing for a fact that i would see him every week in church (non nego btw, i love my church and would not replace it just to move on from a guy haha)",2,1755611628.0,relationships,1,1.0,False
1muj2x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1muj2x2/delve_into_best_coffee_maker_features_with/,Delve Into Best Coffee Maker Features with Cuisinart Brew Central,"Testing out the Cuisinart LK6565000C coffee maker for several weeks has been quite the caffeine-fueled journey for me. As someone who insists on savoring the perfect cup of coffee every morning, the prospect of a 14-cup programmable coffee maker had me intrigued. Right from the unboxing, it made a strong first impression with its modern silver and black design and its stainless steel finish, which gave it a sophisticated yet durable appearance.

**Ease of Use and Programmable Features**  
One of the most useful features I‚Äôve come across is its fully programmable functionality. Being able to set the coffee maker to start brewing 24 hours in advance is an absolute lifesaver, especially on hectic mornings. The clear backlit digital display made it super simple to configure everything. It even allows selection between regular and bold brew strength, tailored perfectly to my varying caffeine needs. Another standout element is the automatic shut-off mode, which I can adjust according to my schedule. These features not only take the guesswork out of coffee brewing but essentially guarantee I never start my day coffee-deprived. 

[Ready to snag Cuisinart LK6565000C? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://designmara.com/p/b0bpc31zdf/)

**Brewing Performance and Temperature Control**  
The most critical test, of course, is how well it brews coffee. It delivers on its promise of hotter coffee without compromising taste. I noticed the carafe plate offers three temperature settings‚Äîhigh, medium, and low‚Äîletting me keep the coffee warm for up to four hours. On a particularly lazy Sunday, the brew-pause feature stole the show. I was able to sneak a cup mid-brew without any drips or mess. It's details like this that make it apparent how much thought went into the design.

**Quality and Capacity**  
This coffee maker is designed not just for daily users but also for offices, larger households, and coffee enthusiasts who need multiple cups in one go. The 14-cup capacity delivered consistently well, and even when I only needed a smaller amount, the 1-4 cup setting ensured that the flavor was just as rich. My coworker once gave it a try and remarked how the gold-tone reusable filter added to the flavor complexity. Plus, it‚Äôs great that I don‚Äôt have to keep buying paper filters‚Äîa tiny win for the environment. 

**Design and Build**  
A coffee maker is as much about functionality as it is about how it fits into your kitchen, and this one scored on both fronts. Its stainless steel accents and compact dimensions fit neatly on my counter without dominating the space. The dripless carafe design made it really easy to pour without spills. Even the handle stayed cool to touch, which is such a small but thoughtful detail.

**Highlights**  
- The 24-hour programmability and adjustable settings are a true game changer.  
- Consistently delivers hot coffee without compromising taste.  
- Excellent carafe design, perfect for both smaller and larger households.  
- Reusable filter enhances flavor and reduces waste.  
- Compact yet stylish stainless steel finish fits seamlessly into modern kitchens.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The build quality is solid but a bit heavy (at 7 pounds), which could be a hassle for those who store it away frequently.  
- Blue backlit display, while clear, can be slightly hard to read in direct sunlight.  
- Self-cleaning feature is convenient, but keeping up with the ""time to clean"" alert routine can be demanding for the lazier among us.

**Peer Products**  
If you‚Äôre comparing this to other kitchen coffee makers like Keurig or Ninja models, the 14-cup capacity offers a clear advantage for households or offices needing large amounts of java. The brew versatility here is stronger, too, given its strength and volume adjustments. However, for individuals or light coffee drinkers, a single-serve machine might be a leaner pick. Ninja machines, for instance, tend to include frothing capabilities, which might appeal more to latte or cappuccino lovers, where this coffee maker is strictly drip-focused.

**Smart Spending**  
When evaluating its features against its cost, this coffee machine manages to find the sweet spot between performance and affordability. It‚Äôs not the cheapest option on the market, but the durability, programmability, and overall performance make it worth every penny. For someone looking to invest in a high-volume, reliable coffee maker that does not require constant micromanagement, it offers incredible value for money.

1muj2na,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1muj2na/why_choose_the_ninja_dualbrew_coffee_maker_review/,Why Choose the Ninja DualBrew Coffee Maker Review for Hot and Iced Perfection?,"Testing out the Ninja CFP100 Series DualBrew Hot & Iced Coffee Maker has been a daily delight and occasional challenge as I integrated it into my morning routine. Balancing its pros and cons, I‚Äôve found it to be a capable coffee maker, though it might not be for everyone. This black, sleek drip coffee machine is programmable, versatile, and delivers decent results for both hot and iced coffee enthusiasts. While satisfying overall, a deeper dive into its features reveals both its winning points and areas for improvement.

**Design and User Experience**  
A coffee maker‚Äôs design can make or break a user‚Äôs experience, and this one lands favorably on most fronts. The Ninja DualBrew looks good on the counter, though its dimensions of 11.03""D x 9.9""W x 15.22""H may require some planning for smaller kitchens. The build quality is solid, and it doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy when handling components like the filter or carafe. Buttons for operation are intuitive and straightforward, which suits those who, like me, occasionally struggle with overcomplicated machines. It includes multiple accessories, such as the 12-cup glass carafe, pod adapter, scoop, and paper filters.

**Performance**  
Ideal for both K-Cups and ground coffee, this machine really tries to be a jack of all trades. It boasts nine brew sizes for grounds and four for pods, which makes customizing your morning coffee effortless. I‚Äôve tested Classic, Rich, and Over Ice settings, and while the Classic and Rich modes produced flavorful and aromatic coffee, the iced brew delivered mixed results‚Äîrefreshing but occasionally leaning towards lukewarm. Still, its Thermal Flavor Extraction Duo technology ensures even saturation and optimal temperature control, guaranteeing every cup‚Äôs quality.

**Check [Ninja CFP100 Series] price on Amazon.**  

**Highlights**  
- Dual coffee maker system for grounds and K-Cups.  
- A variety of brew size options for different cup or carafe needs.  
- Programmable settings with Classic, Rich, or Over Ice options.  
- 60-ounce removable water reservoir simplifies refills.  

**Flaws**  
Programming quirks surfaced when I attempted to juggle between hot and iced settings on crazy-busy mornings. Precision is key, yet skipping a step often resulted in either weak coffee or slight spills due to misalignment. The 60-ounce reservoir sounds generous, but frequent re-filling becomes a task when outputting at full capacity weekend after weekend. Lastly, its promised 4-hour warming plate feature doesn‚Äôt entirely deliver‚Äîby the third hour, I felt the heat diminished.

**Challengers**  
Having compared this to other coffee makers in its class, this one stands out for its dual compatibility with pods and ground coffee. While popular competitors like the Keurig K-Elite only cater to pod users, the Ninja leaves room for flexibility. Additionally, models such as Cuisinart SS-15 offer more programming finesse but often feature bulkier bodywork, less suited to tighter spaces.

**Quality for Price**  
Considering its versatility and features, the Ninja is priced fairly among mid-tier coffee makers. However, if you‚Äôre not someone who needs both pods and grounds capability, this may be slightly overkill. People who primarily want good iced coffee year-round might find dedicated iced coffee devices a cheaper alternative. Still, the multiple brew size options and ease of use make this machine a pragmatic investment for large households or those juggling preferences.

# ‚ö° What MCP Is (Plain English):

>MCP stands for¬†**Model Context Protocol**¬†‚Äî a new standard that lets AI models like ChatGPT connect to¬†**external tools, APIs, and data sources**¬†in real time.

>!Let your AI agent connect to Uber, Lyft, Amazon, LinkedIn - you name it, and actually do all the things you can do in all these platforms. How does it sound?!<

**MCP**¬†is Like¬†**USB-C for ChatGPT**. One common plug to safely connects ChatGPT to¬†*any tool or data, any website, cloud application, service*.... anything! Need to order pizza? Schedule a ride home? Send email, pay for grocery, rent a car, buy a flight ticket, submit tax declaration, send flowers with a gift card to your sweethart - all done by chatting with ChatGPT!

# üí° What is Remote MCP?

Remote MCP is MCP server that you run somewhere, which has your credentials to connect to all of these tools and is a code that translates ChatGPT commands into the API calls to a respective service.

***THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF MCP SERVERS IN GITHUB ALREADY!***¬†ANd this number is growing every single day!!!

# But there is a BUT...

**Remote MCP**¬†means those tools don‚Äôt have to live on your computer ‚Äî they can be running somewhere out there in the cloud, ready for ChatGPT to call whenever you need them.

**And here is a CATCH:**

Here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ MCP isn‚Äôt just something you¬†*download*.  
You actually have to¬†**run**¬†it somewhere. And unless you have:

* A PhD in Computer Science
* 10+ years of software development under your belt
* Or a license in certified¬†*black magic programming*

‚Ä¶you probably won‚Äôt get it working without a few tears, a gallon of coffee, and maybe a minor existential crisis.

*When Remote MCP becomes available to all ChatGPT users, you won‚Äôt need to know how it works under the hood ‚Äî you‚Äôll just click ‚Äúconnect‚Äù and boom: ChatGPT can use your favorite tool, fetch your data, or automate your work.*

1muiw9d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1muiw9d,Pairing Chronicles #221: Buffalo Trace + Buffalo Trace,"So I did it. I went and got myself a Buffalo Trace cigar and of course, I paired it with Buffalo Trace. I was tempted to be a rebel and try it with Woodford or Bulleit or whatever even rum, but I really wasn't feeling creative at all. I think the people who made this cigar weren't feeling creative either and I just went with the same vibe. 

It's not that it's a bad cigar. It really isn't. But there's nothing groundbreaking or even fun enough. I was half expecting the brand to play a part in some developmental stage of the cigar, but they just let them use the logo on their labels. There's no barrel aging, barrel fermenting or bourbon dousing. And to a certain degree, I appreciate it, as I've grown a bit tired of so many cigars that feature the logo of some spirit maker and are aged in their barrels, and then you don't feel even a bit of the flavor they are famous for. 

There were flavors of black pepper and cayenne pepper which amounted for like 70% of the flavors. Then around 20% coffee and 10% leather. Nothing else.

My (22F) best friend (20F) comes from a much more financially stable house than i do. I've worked part time jobs since the day I turned 16, and since that day, my parents havent paid for anything. I bought my own car, invested in my education all by myself, bought groceries every week, paid my insurance, gas, necessities, and hobby investments all by myself. My love language is treating people I love and going all out for birthday presents, graduation, etc. I come from a middle eastern background where it's very impolite to not insist on paying the bill. Needless to say, i've had some rough bumps along the road of financial responsibility, but i'm happy to say i'm doing fine now. 

My ex best friend, however, comes from a well off family, and has full financial support from her parents. No paying her own insurance, education, etc. We were absolutely inseparable; though one thing bothered me throughout the entire friendship. She never picked up even a single bill, and we went out for coffee, snacks or lunch every single week. Never insisted to pay, or even pay me back her share. Every Christmas and birthday, she would cheap out, telling me she has a massive budget but show up with cheap stuff off of temu, meanwhile I was buying her expensive items with a lot of sentiment. It's was never about the money, just the thought of her putting in the absolute lowest effort when I was trying so, so hard for her. I just could not imagine her never noticing how she never even looked at the bill, offered to pay me back, or noticed the very obvious difference in both effort and money going into this friendship. 

I called her out on it in the most respectful way after we went to the fair and she let me spend everything on her again. She told me she was on a budget of 30‚Ç¨, which is honestly insane for a fair. She sent me 10‚Ç¨ back for everything i paid, which was literally around 40‚Ç¨. I told her I feel rather used, that I find it unfair that I have to sponsor this entire friendship out of my own pocket when it's absolutely not necessary, not even mentioning things like the gifts and lack of effort. 

She just blocked me on absolutely everything. Nearly 3 years of friendship down the drain. No reaction, no apology, no recognition, just blocked on everything. This made me absolutely explode which rage and I messaged her on tiktok (the only app where she didn't block me so she could still see my reposts). I exploded, called her out of everything; the money situation, the pathological lying, the jealousy, talking bad about my family, etc. She victimized herself instantly by telling me how awful I was for saying these things, and that she's always been ""very careful"" about money in this friendship and that everything was pretty much 50/50 and that she also paid her fair share. None of it is true. She never treated me to anything. Now she's acting like i'm some kind of bully, saying all these horrible things completely out of nowhere. 

Yes, the text i sent on tiktok was mean and if i'd thought about it twice, i might have not sent it. But god the guilt tripping, the victimizing, the gaslighting and the manipulation are just driving me insane. We blocked each other on everything, but it hurts so much how i've put in all this love and effort, and the only thing i get in return is a slap in the face by blocking me like it never meant anything at all. Or even worse, it's just her being mad she got caught taking advantage of me in the worst way possible. ",1,1755611157.0,Rants,0,1.0,False
1muivtm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechTrench/comments/1muivtm/delve_into_the_best_bluetooth_headset_poly/,Delve Into the Best Bluetooth Headset Poly Voyager Worth It,"Experiencing the Poly 211317-02 Voyager headset firsthand gave me the opportunity to test its claim to be an ideal choice for office professionals. As someone who works remotely and frequently jumps between virtual meetings and focus sessions, I knew I'd put its features to rigorous use. From its Bluetooth connectivity to its noise-canceling capabilities, this wireless headset promised a lot. Did it live up to my expectations? Mostly, but not without a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Design and Comfort**  
The first thing that caught my attention was the ergonomic design. The angular earpiece shape, combined with a lightweight frame of just 3.5 ounces, made this headset feel almost invisible during all-day wear. Its leather materials feel soft against the skin, and, trust me, after wearing it through three lengthy meetings on one Monday alone, there was no irritation or fatigue. The flexible microphone boom is not only functional but also gave a slightly futuristic vibe to the overall look. However, I did find that the boom flexes a little too easily; it sometimes feels as though it could lose its stability over time, which might be a minor nuisance.

**Performance and Connectivity**  
This headset‚Äôs standout feature is, hands down, its Bluetooth capabilities. It pairs seamlessly with Bluetooth-enabled devices, and the 30-meter Bluetooth range allowed me to wander where I pleased during calls. Connection stability was decent, though there was a brief hiccup when I walked near my microwave (Bluetooth interference is likely to blame). The headset‚Äôs 12-hour battery life added convenience, as it effortlessly powered through my workday without requiring a midday charge. Bonus points for including a CR2 battery in the box‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt have to hunt for one, which is always a win.

**Good Points**  
- Exceptional comfort for multi-hour use  
- Stable Bluetooth connection with great range  
- Lightweight and easy to carry with included case  

[Ready to buy Poly 211317-02 Voyager? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://headsetsunlimited.com/p/b07hpdmg2q/)  

**Audio Quality and Noise Cancellation**  
For a headset geared toward office professionals, the sound quality is solid. It holds a frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz, delivering clear audio that never felt muffled or distorted. Whether I was on Zoom calls or streaming my favorite podcast, the sound did not disappoint. The noise-isolation feature, however, could be better. Although it reduces some background noise, don't expect it to cancel out particularly loud environments like bustling coffee shops. At home, where ambient noise is minimal, it performs admirably. That said, the microphone picks up voice cleanly and rarely distorts even during lengthy calls.

**Downsides**  
- Noise cancellation isn‚Äôt strong enough for noisy environments  
- Microphone boom may feel slightly fragile  
- Bluetooth can occasionally falter near strong interference  

**Ease of Use and Portability**  
The headset is intuitive to use. Controls like volume adjustment and call answering are conveniently placed on the device and respond well to light presses. The folding design and included carrying case make it easy to toss into my bag without worrying about damaging it. Its portability came in handy the other day when I had to switch work spots and managed to pack up quickly without much fuss.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this headset to direct competitors like the Jabra Evolve 75 or Logitech Zone Wireless reveals both strengths and missed opportunities. The Jabra, for instance, offers superior active noise-canceling (ANC) but comes at a higher price point. On the other hand, Logitech's product matches this headset in battery life but lacks the same lightweight feeling that made the Poly Voyager so enjoyable for extended wear. The Voyager finds its niche with its comfort and mid-range price point, though you'll probably want to look elsewhere if ANC tops your priority list.

**Affordability and Financial Value**  
The pricing of this headset feels appropriate for what it offers. It balances quality and functionality without veering into exorbitant territory. With its comfort, portability, and solid audio performance, I‚Äôd call it a strong middle-ground option for its category. Sure, it doesn't feature the laser-focused noise cancellation of higher-end models, but the value proposition is still there for remote professionals or anyone who doesn‚Äôt require absolute silence to focus.

1muiupj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedAndRated/comments/1muiupj/should_you_try_the_best_coffee_machine_xbloom/,Should You Try the Best Coffee Machine xBloom Studio Review,"Testing out the xBloom FW-02A-01 over the past few weeks has been an adventure in caffeinated bliss. This coffee machine isn‚Äôt your typical drip coffee maker. It‚Äôs got so much packed into it that I almost felt it was challenging me to a barista duel. The sleek midnight black minimalist design immediately caught my attention when I unboxed it. It's slightly tall at about 14.75 inches, but it managed to fit snugly on my countertop without looking out of place. Of course, I made sure to put it right beside my stash of coffee beans and my growing collection of mugs because, let‚Äôs face it, coffee is life.

**Key Benefits**

- Fully customizable options: Autopilot, Copilot, and Freesolo settings adapt to different user needs.
- Integrated grinder and app-controlled settings for a personalized brewing experience.
- Compostable xPods with whole beans, reducing waste while delivering convenience.
- Intuitive tactile knobs with an LED matrix for effortless interaction.

The various brewing modes were the first thing I wanted to dive into. The Autopilot mode is perfect for lazy mornings where I just want to toss in the xPod, tap the recipe card it comes with, and hit start. It‚Äôs crazy convenient. Copilot gave me a little more control over the process without overwhelming me, while Freesolo mode unleashed my inner coffee artist. I even pretended to teach my younger cousin the basics of pour-over brewing using this machine, and we were laughing the whole way through because of how I nerded out on the grind settings.

[Check xBloom FW-02A-01 price on Amazon.](https://kepmad.com/p/b0dkkly1v9/)

**Smart Features at Play**

The xBloom app is where a lot of the action happens. I used it to adjust settings to brew a cup of coffee exactly how I like it‚Äîsmooth, strong, and slightly nutty. The ability to save recipes on the app was a game-changer. I even ended up sharing my brew-settings with a coworker who kept asking for specifics after I brought them a cup. The machine‚Äôs interaction with the pod and grinder system is seamless. Place the pod in the dock, let the grinder do its thing, and within minutes, fresh coffee goodness is ready to go.

I loved the anti-static ionizer in the grinder. It eliminated the mess of coffee grounds sticking everywhere, which is something my last coffee grinder struggled with. The magnetic dosing cup, complete with its modular convenience, added to the overall experience of precision brewing.

**Room for Improvement**

- The machine is a bit on the taller side, which could be tricky for smaller kitchen spaces.
- Only 10 paper filters are included initially, and replacements may add to the ongoing cost.
- The xPods, while innovative and efficient, limit you to their system if you want full convenience.

**Competitors**

When comparing this to other premium coffee makers, it‚Äôs evident that the xBloom holds its own. Machines like the Breville Barista Pro or Technivorm Moccamaster offer solid alternatives in build quality and taste, but they don't integrate as much automation with app control. While Breville's steam wand might excel for latte art, the xBloom excels where simplicity and customization intersect. On the other hand, budget espresso makers or standard drip machines may provide you with great coffee but lack the technological edge this product offers. It becomes more of a decision about the experience you want from your morning coffee.

**Smart Spending**

From my perspective, the xBloom FW-02A-01 finds itself in a sweet spot for coffee enthusiasts who are willing to invest in consistent, high-quality cups of joe. With the added benefit of being able to use whole beans straight out of the pods or your own selection, it combines sustainability and convenience. While it isn‚Äôt priced for casual coffee drinkers, the value it delivers for features like the integrated grinder and programmable brewing makes it worth the jump.

I own a Bianca and recently got a new Eureka Mignon Turbo.

I now come up with an issue which I havnt been able to fix so far..

I love darker roasts (less dense), but when I try to grind 18gr in my 14 to 18 gr basket (from the Bianca), the coffee completely overflows the PF and makes a huge mess.

I bought the dedicated Eureka funnel to fix it; however the issue remains...if by chance it doesnt overflow, it does when i remove the PF from the fork, even being extra careful.. (it overflows from the opened size)

The only solution I found is to grind in 2 times, half tamping in between...but I hate it as it reduces the accuracy of the timer (and weight) and I feel the tamping is not as even.

I have also tried moving on to 16gr. with the same ratio. That works great in the cup but the pucks are terribly muddy due to the larger headspace...

Any ideas ? I thought about using a bigger basket but I'd probably end up with the same watery pucks?",1,1755611008.0,espresso,4,1.0,False
1muitqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1muitqq/find_out_if_the_best_countertop_ice_maker_from/,Find Out if the Best Countertop Ice Maker from Silonn Delivers,"The Silonn SLIM25B-US countertop ice maker has become a staple in my kitchen. Compact, functional, and user-friendly, it ticks many boxes for anyone in need of a reliable, small-scale ice maker. As someone who frequently entertains guests, I decided to test this machine thoroughly over a couple of weeks to see if it lived up to the hype. While it performed admirably in many areas, there are a few quirks worth noting.

**Compact Design for Versatile Use**

One of the first things I noticed about this countertop ice maker is its thoughtfully compact design. Measuring a mere 11.93 x 11.1 x 9.8 inches and weighing just 14.5 pounds, the machine is incredibly portable. It has a flip-up handle, making it easy to carry to outdoor barbecues, holiday gatherings, or even an RV trip. Its sleek black-transparent finish fits well within various decor styles. I found the size particularly convenient for my small kitchen counter, where it didn‚Äôt compete for precious space with my coffee maker and other appliances.

**Fast Ice Production**

Unlike older or bulkier machines I‚Äôve tried in the past, this unit impressed me with its speed. It cranks out nine bullet-shaped ice cubes in just six minutes, which is perfect for on-the-fly cocktail preparations during a party. With a daily ice-making capacity of 26 pounds, I never had a moment where my cold drinks lacked ice. The two ice size options, specifically for smaller or larger cubes, provide flexibility depending on the type of beverage I‚Äôm serving. I personally prefer the smaller cubes for smoothies, while the larger ones are ideal for highball cocktails. 

**[Check Silonn SLIM25B-US price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0d95wgnyv/)**

**Simple Operation and Smart Indicators**

The plug-and-play simplicity of this machine is another highlight. Once the tank is filled with water (1.2 liters in capacity), operation is almost completely hands-free. The machine‚Äôs indicators provide thorough guidance, such as alerting me when it‚Äôs time to refill water or empty the overflowing basket. My weekend brunch parties often extend hours, and I appreciate that the lights guide me without forcing frequent checks. It‚Äôs also sparing in water usage‚Äîmelted ice rolls back into the machine for recycling, which feels both efficient and eco-friendly.

**Durability and Quiet Performance**

What struck me as impressive about this portable ice maker is its nearly silent operation. With a noise level of about 45 dB, it‚Äôs quieter than my dishwasher, allowing it to run in the background without disturbing conversations or my working-from-home video calls. The food-grade PP material inside the machine feels sturdy, and despite its lightweight, it doesn't feel fragile. Over two weeks, it withstood constant use without any visible wear or hiccups in functionality, so it seems built to last.

**Self-Cleaning Feature Saves Time**

Cleaning appliances is always my least favorite chore, but Silonn has cleverly added a self-cleaning mode to this model. Simply adding water, removing the basket, pressing the Select button, and starting the 5-minute cleaning process takes care of the job. I love that it ensures the ice always tastes fresh and prevents any build-up of miscellaneous odors. Draining out the machine was a breeze, and I quickly wiped it for dry storage.

**Strengths**

- Ample production capacity: 26 pounds of ice daily, perfect for hosting.
- Compact and portable design for easy mobility.
- Ultra-quiet operation that doesn‚Äôt disrupt the ambiance.
- Two ice sizes for versatility in different beverages.
- Innovatively features a self-cleaning mode for effortless maintenance.

**Flaws**

- No insulated basket, which means the ice begins to melt relatively quickly once made.
- The absence of a timer or scheduling function limits advance preparation.
- Occasionally, the first batch of ice cubes was slightly uneven in shape.

**Competing Brands**

I‚Äôve had some experience with alternative countertop ice makers like the GE Profile Opal and the Frigidaire EFIC108. While the GE model boasts a chic design and pebble ice production, it comes at a significantly higher price point, which could be a dealbreaker for someone on a budget. The Frigidaire, on the other hand, provides comparable ice size options but lacks the quiet operation offered by the Silonn. The Silonn held up remarkably well when compared to these competitors, particularly with its self-cleaning feature and lower noise levels, which neither rival could match.

**Cost Efficiency**

For what the Silonn SLIM25B-US offers, it feels like a smart investment. Some ice makers within the same functionality bracket cost considerably more but fail in areas such as noise reduction or portability. The fact that this machine delivers consistently clean ice with minimal operational noise and customizable sizes makes it feel worth every penny, especially for entertainers like myself.

Like, the one that INTPs don't care about how they look. While its backed up by ""oh they're so in their head they can't bother w physical stuff in real world' I just---that feels contradictory. Idk. Maybe I'm the problem, and maybe I'm not actually an INTP but uh. Isn't it just logical? To care about how you look? I'm not talking 'oh do i look pretty/handsome enough in other people's eyes"" I'm talking about impressions.

People love to say ""Your looks don't matter"" but the truth is clearly the opposite. You might wish it doesn't matter, but it kinda does sometimes. First impressions, and I mean first thing that happens when someone looks at you---are so so important. While they're not rigid, and they can change as people 'get to know' each other, sometimes they are very impactful. I feel like I'm running in circles haha. 

For example. When I'm at home, I'll wear like. The same t-shirt. For weeks maybe, and it'll get dirty, but I don't really care. Because I'm At. Home. Once I step outside though, to go anywhere, that's a different story. You have to dress for the occassion you know? I'm not gonna go over to my friend's parents house in a coffee stained shirt and mismatching shoes or whatever. Obviously, I'm gonna put on a nice shirt and nice pants, something that is like casual but neat and clean, to show I am a nice and neat friend. (They don't need to know how messy my room is, or how messy my notes are). If I'm out with my friends, I can wear almost whatever---but still clean clothes at least. Like not stained or something. If I'm at something nice, I'll doll up a bit. 

I feel like if INTPs are supposed to be very logical and smart, then wouldn't we find this as normal? We wouldn't feel the same emotional pressure and anxiety of looking good maybe---but wouldn't logically you know that impressions are important, and impressions lead to connections, and connections are important? If you're happy with just staying at home and just stew in internal debates in your head over the Trolley Problem or anything controversial---then yeah, i guess that makes sense. But logically, to survive, you need a job, preferably a stable sustaining one, and I guess it also depends on your job what kind of connections you need...

For me at least, I needed to get into med-school, so connections were so important. It was pretty miserable actually now that I think about it. Both constantly on the move to get volunteer hours and also making connections to help w interviews and recommendations....Not to mention studying was hard, since I kept zoning out. 

Maybe does this make me \*not\* an INTP? I feel like I check out a lot of boxes, but also like really contradict a lot of the general stereotypes. It's not that I'm emotional, but I'm emotionally aware and logically aware of social workings enough to give off the ""right reactions"" in the ""right"" situations. I suck at comforting people, beyond the general ""Oh. Uh. It's gonna be alright. Do you wanna go get ice cream?"" But you know. INTPs have emotions. We're not robots. I'm definitely not a robot, but also, definitely not INFP like I do prioritze logic, but also. The whole thing. All of the above.

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm still with my girlfriend out of love or just pity. I feel drained emotionally and financially, and I need advice on whether I should keep trying or if it‚Äôs healthier to let go.

**Context:**  
My girlfriend and I have been together for over 6 years. We met in high school, and she was the one who courted me. We stayed together through college, but last year she admitted while really crying that she had been talking to another girl (I didn‚Äôt know she was bi at the time). That‚Äôs when we officially broke up.

I can‚Äôt completely blame her for it, because during those months I was depressed, emotionally distant, and not giving her the attention she deserved. I admit I was falling out of love back then.

A few months later, we started talking again even though she was still in her new relationship. I only kept in touch because I worried she might h\*rm herself again if she had no one to talk to. She told me how toxic her relationship was, and both of them were engaging in self-h\*rm. I didn‚Äôt feel love for her anymore, just pity. Such as when I skipped her birthday, and on that same day I didn't expect that she'll actually attempted to off herself and was rushed to hospital, and had to go through therapy.

Eventually, after months of talking, we got closure and somehow ended up back together.

Now that we‚Äôre together again, here‚Äôs the situation: she‚Äôs kind and caring, even using all of her small business income to help pay for her grandma‚Äôs medical bills. However, she struggles with maturity and responsibility. She grew up wealthy with household help, so she never really learned money management and taking care of things. She‚Äôs also not very careful,  she has lost several phones already (some stolen, some dropped), sometimes carries her bag wide open in public, almost always gets hit by vehicles while crossing roads, and generally seems like she‚Äôs always on the edge of losing things or putting herself in risky situations.

Even though her family is wealthy, she and her grandma don‚Äôt receive much direct support because of complicated family issues. That‚Äôs why she often has to cover expenses herself. Recently, I‚Äôve been stepping in to support her financially. I do side hustles and never expend any for myself just to send her money, which usually ends up in her business or her grandma‚Äôs medical bills. I also cover things like her monthly phone installment, loans, food, coffee, and online shopping.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôm about to graduate college, still unemployed, and currently working as a housekeeper for my uncle while dealing with my family issues, and multiple job rejections. Between all of that and supporting her, even if I am not forced to by her, I feel physically and mentally exhausted.

**Previous Attempts:**  
In the past, I tried setting boundaries by pulling away when I didn‚Äôt feel love anymore, but she would reach out again, and I worried about her safety if I completely cut contact. I also advised her to leave her toxic relationship before we got back together, and eventually she did. Since then, I‚Äôve been trying to help by supporting her business, her, and her grandma, I am not forced to by her, but it‚Äôs draining me.

Now I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôm with her because I truly love her, or if I only feel responsible for her. I‚Äôm questioning whether this relationship is still healthy for me, especially as I‚Äôm just about to start my own adult life.",1,1755610648.0,adviceph,2,1.0,False

But now after having a great coffee date with this other woman I met online (we'll call her M). and going on another date next week... I can't help but still think about K.

I haven't had a chance to tell K how I feel towards her. She's been too busy to have time to hangout (figures, we only hangout once a month). Plus I've only gotten mixed reponses of ""you should tell her"" vs ""you should NOT tell her how you feel""

I really have no idea what to do. K i've known for over a year and she gets me like no one has before. Yet M has more in common with me but there's just something missing, maybe because I only met her once so far. This isn't to say I know a relationship would even grow with M. BUT if it did, I genuinely wouldn't know what to do. Before, I thought getting in a relationship would help me forget about K, but it doesn't feel like that? At least not right now?

I think the fucked part is the fact I've introduced K to family and friends already and vice versa (before I grew feelings).

1muik4m,https://coffeechronicler.com/mavo-phantox-pro-review/,Mavo Phantox Pro Hand Grinder Review Article by The Coffee Chronicler,"One of my favorite coffee experts and someone whose opinion I trust when it comes to coffee grinders, brewers, and other coffee gear is Asser Christensen, a guy from Denmark who not only has a YouTube channel, but also a website where he posts articles relating to all things coffee. 

Recently, I was intrigued by his article on a Chinese-made hand grinder I‚Äôve seen mention of on various coffee sub-reddits over the past year or so - the Mavo Phantox Pro. 

So many hand grinders have come out of China and Taiwan over the last few years, that it can be almost impossible to keep track of them all. 

China and Taiwan are definitely on the cutting edge right now when it comes to coffee grinders, and its interesting to keep track of the cutting edge stuff that‚Äôs coming out, because the innovation is changing things rapidly. 

Personally, I own a couple of hand grinders (the X-Pro and the J-Ultra) made by 1Zpresso, a Taiwanese manufacturer which may be the leader in quality hand grinders right now. 

But I was particularly interested in Asser‚Äôs take on the Phantox Pro, because it‚Äôs so similar to my X-Pro (current version sold is called the X-Ultra), which is already one of the top grinders out there for those who enjoy light roast pourovers and what‚Äôs referred to as ‚Äúmodern espresso‚Äù (light roast, with a focus more on bright acidity and clarity in the shot, rather than the traditional, syrupy, chocolatey, darker roast that most people associate with espresso). 

And at $143.99 on Amazon, which undercuts the X-Ultra by about $15, its not a bad price at all, especially considering the praise that Asser heaps on this grinder. 

Asser says top-tier hand grinders like the 1zpresso K-Ultra are still a tad better for pourover, but, ‚Äúfor light roast espresso, this might be the best hand grinder I‚Äôve used‚Äù. 

That‚Äôs an extremely bold statement, especially for Asser!

I think this might start to be my number one recommendation for hand grinders for those who like to make light roast espresso and modern espresso.

1muiium,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1muiium/27f_with_28m_boyfriend_of_6_years_he_said_he/,"27F with 28M boyfriend of 6 years : he said he regrets knowing me after a fight, should I stay or leave?","Hi everyone, I really need some advice. I‚Äôve been ( 27yo )  with my boyfriend ( 28yo ) for six years, and we were planning to get engaged this year. Recently, we had a fight that escalated badly, and I‚Äôm not sure if our relationship can survive this.

Here‚Äôs what happened:

We were in his cousin‚Äôs car with his cousin and the cousin‚Äôs girlfriend on the way to the beach. I was already mad.He accidentally spilled coffee on me, and I reacted by screaming. I know my reaction was harsh, but I was more upset about his lying. 

So when everyone else went swimming, I told him I was mad because he lied about where he was the night before. I had seen Instagram stories proving he went to a club while texting me as if he was at home, and he even created a fake story about his brother fighting with his wife,  he got extremely defensive. He told me to leave him alone, accused me of being disrespectful, impolite, and having no shame, threw his phone away, and stayed mad while I cried..

 Even after I came home, I sent multiple messages: apologizing, begging him to not break up, promising it would never happen again, and asking him to give me a chance to fix things.

His responses were : 

‚ÄúThis is the worst thing you have ever done in front of people.‚Äù

‚ÄúI really cannot forgive you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou publicly humiliated me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI regret knowing you.‚Äù

I tried to reason with him, explaining my reaction came from feeling hurt and betrayed, that I‚Äôve never snooped on his phone, and that I trusted him but he stayed cold, left me on seen, and refused to talk. I even tried giving him space, not messaging for days, and then reaching out gently, but he continues to ignore me. He removed my name from his Instagram bio and hasn‚Äôt answered calls. 

In his last message, he said he feels overwhelmed, exhausted, and in a very difficult period. He implied that he needs to distance himself from me and the relationship for now to ""fight life alone"" and that ""he's living better this way"".

I don‚Äôt fully understand his last message, but it feels like he‚Äôs justifying wanting to break up. I feel like he‚Äôs using this fight as an excuse to avoid engagement and possibly back away from the relationship, even though we‚Äôve invested so much into it.

This all happened after six years together. The things he said have left me completely shocked, hurt, and confused. I would've never imagined him to say it.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Should I keep trying to fix things, or is this a sign that it‚Äôs time to let go? Any advice would really help.",1,1755610277.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

We visited a coffee farm that was run by K'Ho people. They weren't running tours that day but they were so nice and ended up taking us out to pick mushrooms with them, and then after they cooked us a lunch of mushrooms and rice. They gave us a small bowl of chili peppers as a side to add into the meal as is customary in vietnam. Our host told us that they were ""jungle peppers"" that they picked and that they add them to everything. Their flavor was a very strong lemongrass and floral profile and they were quite spicy - similar spice level to many of the birds eye chili's we had in Saigon in our Bun Bo Hue, which is to say quite a bit of sweat and runny nose. They were small thin and shaped like birds eye but very different flavor.

Any ideas?

I got Covid in May 2023. Out of all my family of 6 who contracted Covid at the same time, I felt the least miserable while it ran its course. I was also the only one who lost their sense of taste and smell for 3 months after.
The brain fog was bad for over a year but has since improved. The only thing that hasn‚Äôt improved, and has stayed the same, is my gag reflex. 

I always used to gag when I brush my teeth, but only when I brushed my tongue it was never that bad. Now I can barely even put the brush in my mouth, and once the intense gagging ceases I find tears streaming down my face. The same gagging happens every single morning right after breakfast. Doesn‚Äôt matter what I had for breakfast or if I had coffee with it. And sometimes it happens when the smell of the air changes, like when I step outside to go for a walk; it‚Äôs a nice smell, but the change triggers it so much I have to stop walking and wait for it to stop.

I went to the doctor and there‚Äôs no cure for it apparently. But it sucks so much and my family thinks I‚Äôm just being dramatic for attention‚Ä¶ like, why would I wanna do THAT for attention? I just wanna live my life as normal. I struggle to eat enough as it is because of my history with eating disorders, and my gag reflex is discouraging the eating habits that took so much effort to build up again. Not to mention my dental history is bad enough without the struggle of brushing my teeth, and now I‚Äôm getting more cavities since it‚Äôs almost impossible for me to brush my teeth for very long anymore. 

Has anybody else had this symptom? Did it ever go away or have you found a way to calm it down? Anything? ",1,1755610257.0,covidlonghaulers,3,0.67,False

I don't remember the name but it's totally AU but set in the Finder universe. Hawke (male) is a hacker on the run thanks to Anders who is an activist and blew up an important church, I think in Paris. Hawk helped him without knowing with his hacking and when he realized what Anders did Hawke ran to Japan to escape the feds. Fenris is hunting him but we only see Fenris in the first chapter or prologue and never again. Fic wasn't done at the time. Anyway, Hawk is at a coffee shop in Japan and he needs money to hide for a while so he hacks into Asami's club and steals a large sum of money. Asami discovers this and has his man track Hawk down and bring him to his office. Both men are hot for each other so Asami offers a job to Hawk. Hawk takes the job (no choice) and there's  a few steamy moments between them regarding a restaurant and Asami forcing Hawk to live with him and Takaba in their apartment. Oh, Hawk is into bondage and a sub so Asami wants to use Hawk to train Takaba how to be a dom.

1muihy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTicker/comments/1muihy4/canada_inflation_eases_to_17_driven_by_falling/,"Canada Inflation Eases to 1.7%, Driven by Falling Gas Prices","Bloomberg) -- Canadian consumer prices moderated slightly and underlying pressures broadly eased.

The consumer price index rose 1.7% from a year ago in July, down from June‚Äôs 1.9% increase, Statistics Canada data showed Tuesday. That was slower than the median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The index increased 0.3% on a monthly basis, matching economist expectations.

July‚Äôs deceleration was led by gasoline prices, which fell 16.1% from a year earlier, reflecting the removal of the consumer carbon tax. Prices also fell 0.7% on the month, due to the Iran-Israel ceasefire as well as increased supply from producing countries. Excluding gasoline, the index rose 2.5%, matching increases in May and June.

The loonie extended the day‚Äôs losses versus the US dollar after the inflation report and traded around C$1.3835 as of 8:55 a.m. in Ottawa. Canadian debt edged higher across the curve, with the two-year yield slipping to 2.71%.

 
 
A range of underlying price pressures showed conflicting signals. The average of the Bank of Canada‚Äôs two preferred core measures accelerated slightly, rising 3.05% and up from 3% in June. But the three-month moving average of the core rates slowed to 2.43%, from 3.39% previously.

CPI excluding taxes eased to 2.3%, while CPI excluding shelter slowed to 1.2%. CPI excluding food and energy dropped to 2.5%, and CPI excluding eight volatile components and indirect taxes fell to 2.6%. The share of components with the consumer price index basket that are rising 3% and higher ‚Äî another key metric that the bank‚Äôs policymakers are watching closely ‚Äî shrank to 37.3%, from 39.1% in June.

With July‚Äôs consumer-price data painting a mixed picture, the next inflation report ‚Äî due a day before the next rate decision on Sept. 17 ‚Äî will likely become more important for policymakers who are mulling whether to reduce the policy interest rate, after keeping it unchanged at 2.75% for three straight meetings.

During their rate deliberations last month, they debated rate cuts. Some members held the view that the bank may have already provided sufficient support through its aggressive easing cycle. Others said further support would likely be needed given the softness in the economy, particularly if the labor market weakened further.

Key core measures are all below 3% and in line with the inflation target, Charles St-Arnaud, chief economist at Alberta Central, said in an email. However, even if the trend continues, the average of the central bank‚Äôs preferred measures is likely to remain at 3% until about October, he said.

‚ÄúIt will likely continue its wait-and-see approach and stay on hold at the September meeting, unless the economy deteriorates sharply.‚Äù

Positive Momentum

Easing in inflationary pressures during July means one obstacle on the path toward a potential September rate cut has been cleared, Andrew Grantham, economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a report to investors.  

‚ÄúWhile there is still a lot more data to be released between now and the mid-September BoC meeting (including another CPI release), today‚Äôs release is supportive of our current call for a 25 basis-point reduction at that time,‚Äù he said in a report to investors. 

What Bloomberg Economics Says...

‚ÄúDisinflation became more pervasive during the month, despite cost pressures from tariffs. To us that signals weak domestic demand is limiting the extent to which firms can raise prices and shows inflation pressures are likely contained.‚Äù

‚Äî Stuart Paul, Canada and US economist


The inflation report is positive on many fronts, Andrew DiCapua, principal economist at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said in an email.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still seeing sticky core measures in July as risks to progress, but if this momentum continues, we could see the Bank of Canada move rates lower in September,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTime will tell if tariffs are feeding through consumer prices, but there are some upward trends on food and durable goods products that could tilt the scales as the effects of tariffs are realized.‚Äù

In July, Canadians paid more for food and shelter. Prices for food purchased from stores grew faster, jumping 3.4% from a year ago. Unfavorable weather in growing cocoa and coffee-growing regions led to higher prices for products using those ingredients. Consumers paid 27.1% more at grocery stores than they did in July 2020.

Shelter prices rose 3% from a year ago, up from June‚Äôs 2.9% increase, with upward pressure primarily stemming from the natural gas and rent. This was the first acceleration in shelter prices since February 2024. Rent prices grew 5.1% and accelerated most in Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador and British Columbia.

Out of 10 Canadian provinces, six saw prices rising at a slower year-over-year pace in July compared with June. Nova Scotia‚Äôs inflation held steady. Quebec, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador saw higher inflation in July, with the latter experiencing the most acceleration, mainly due to higher electricity prices.",1,1755610221.0,TheTicker,0,1.0,False
1muihq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_amzonestepusa/comments/1muihq2/what_makes_shoppers_trust_your_product_over_others/,What Makes Shoppers Trust Your Product Over Others?,"Among the thousands of products fighting for attention in the Amazon marketplace, gaining a shopper‚Äôs trust is the key to standing out. Amidst all the choices available, why should they select yours over others? That comes from building a reputation for reliability, quality, and authenticity.

From clear product descriptions to the quality of service offered by a company,¬†[influencing factors](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/what-factors-influence-winning-the-search/)¬†can be wide-ranging. However, each and every single one is pivotal in turning surfing into purchasing.¬†

In the competitive Amazon environment, knowing the reasons your shopper trusts in your product makes all the difference between mere clicks and conversions. Let‚Äôs look into the indispensable factors which will help make your product trustworthy and above the rest.

# How Clear Return Policies Increase Trust in Amazon Sellers

One of the biggest e-commerce sites is Amazon, and with many products available, consumers can easily compare and make decisions. But for many, the process is quite overwhelming when they do not know whether the product quality will be good or after-purchase support will be there.¬†

Among all these things, the return policy is one of the most effective ways¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers can create trust and convert. Let‚Äôs discuss how transparent return policies help sellers and why they have a huge impact on shoppers‚Äô purchasing decisions.

# Reduces Buyer Hesitation

A clear return policy reiterates that they are not going to be stuck with a product that doesn‚Äôt meet their expectations. When buyers feel confident about returning a product if it does not satisfy them, they feel comfortable purchasing a product.¬†

It reduces hesitation, which is commonly experienced in online purchases. Otherwise, customers will be hesitant because they fear the inconvenience of the return process or loss due to a bad purchase.

* Consider a customer who wants to purchase a kitchen blender. She is reluctant because she has doubts about the size and power of the blender in terms of meeting her requirements. A seller offering a 30-day no-questions-asked return policy gives assurance to the customer.

¬†It gives her the confidence to buy the product, thus removing the risk she perceives about it and allows her to use it without long-term commitment.

How this benefits the sellers: Converting people who feel secure about buying is easy for a customer. Moreover, even though they return that product, a smooth process does help, and chances of shopping again increase.

# Improves Customer Satisfaction

Clear return policies greatly contribute to customer satisfaction, no matter how poor the experience may be with the purchased product. Customers love doing business with sellers who will sell to them rather than selling for profit.

¬†It becomes a positive experience where buyers can easily solve a problem with an efficient returns process. This shows the seller values customer loyalty.

* A high-tech gadget seller has a specific return policy with detailed step-by-step instructions on how returns and exchanges can be accomplished. A customer receives faulty merchandise and uses the very simple process to get her replacement.

The customer has a positive overall experience in which she can trust this brand for future purchases. This can also benefit the seller since returning customers are likely to repeat the purchase, while the word of mouth will promote and enhance the seller‚Äôs trustworthiness and credibility due to reviews of experience by customers.

# Promotes Transparency and Trustworthiness

A clearly communicated return policy indicates that the seller has nothing to hide. Clarity reduces ambiguity and allows customers to know what to expect. The customers will perceive the sellers who have clear policies as truthful, which further increases their confidence.

* A seller on Amazon who specializes in selling home d√©cor adds a clear return policy on each listing: ‚ÄúIf you are not completely satisfied with your product, simply return it within 30 days of purchase for a full refund.‚Äù Such an easy and clear policy encourages buyers to make a purchase without hesitation.

How this works to benefit sellers: Transparency breeds buyer confidence. A customer will choose a seller who openly communicates his or her terms because they know there will be support if something does go wrong.

# Encourages First-Time Buyers

The first-time buyer is usually much more cautious, especially in buying from a new seller. They are likely to trust sellers who give clear return instructions. A liberal and transparent policy can calm these fears, making reluctant buyers take the plunge.

* A buyer on¬†[Amazon is looking to buy](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-buy-box/)¬†a winter jacket and is concerned about the sizing. The seller who is offering free exchanges and a 30 days return period helps alleviate this concern, giving the buyer the confidence to buy from him for the first time.

How this benefits the sellers: You can grow your customer base and build long-term loyalty if these are the first-time buyers that have a positive experience with you.

# Reduces Customer Anxiety Over Product Fit or Quality

Online shoppers cannot physically inspect the product before buying, which is unknown in terms of fit, quality, or functionality. Having a clear return policy eliminates much of this anxiety by providing a safety net if the product does not meet expectations.

* A consumer searching for a pair of shoes is hesitant because of a concern over the size. It can be seen that the retailer is offering free returns within 30 days, which the shopper can rely on by taking the shoes back for a change or return when required.

How this is good for sellers: Getting over buyer anxiety increases conversions. Clear return policies ease out the fear of customers making a purchase, so their sales and trust among the customers increase.

# Offering Fast and Free Shipping for More Trust

# Enroll in Amazon FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon)

Amazon‚Äôs Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a phenomenal service for sellers to add fast and free shipping offers to their products. Enrollment in FBA allows one to outsource shipping, where¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†will store a seller‚Äôs inventory in their centers and pack, ship, and handle customer requests.¬†

This way, sellers have the option to use the powerful ‚ÄúPrime‚Äù badge when selling on their product list, which ensures same day, one day, or even two-day shipping.

Fast and guaranteed shipping instills confidence among customers, especially Prime members who are promised such facilities as part of their membership. This is likely to result in increased conversions and repeat sales.

¬†The benefit for the sellers is the logistics network of Amazon, where delivery can be made in a timely manner even across various regions.

* For instance, consider selling exercise equipment such as yoga mats. You become eligible for Prime delivery with FBA. Customers know their order will reach them promptly and hassle-free. Besides, your listing gains more visibility in search results as Amazon gives more preference to Prime-eligible products.

It works to your advantage to succeed with FBA only when there‚Äôs consistent replenishment of the inventory in Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers.¬†

You should take advantage of Amazon‚Äôs management tools for inventory so as not to run out of stock, which will affect your orders and may incur delays or lost sales. You can also ship the orders from other sales channels by availing yourself of Amazon‚Äôs Multi-Channel Fulfillment.¬†

# Use Amazon‚Äôs Seller-Fulfilled Prime (SFP)

It‚Äôs a good option for those sellers who want Prime delivery benefits while still allowing control over their inventory levels, as the Seller-Fulfilled Prime program from¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†does just that.

¬†It means you can display a Prime badge on your listings, offering two-day or same-day shipping to the customers who have Prime benefits, while you would be shipping them out from your own warehouse or facility.

This is one of the best options for specialized¬†[product sellers](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-3d-rendering-vs-product-photography/)¬†or businesses that have products that will not fit well in an Amazon fulfillment center, including perishable products or bespoke products.¬†

Through SFP, you can leverage this service to earn the trust of¬†[Amazon‚Äôs Prime](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-prepare-amazon-prime-day-coupons-and-exclusive-deals/)¬†customer base: known for loyalty and openness to spending a little extra for Prime-eligible purchases.

* For instance, a seller that deals with custom-made leather wallets can use SFP to fill orders directly. They have control over how the order is packaged and personalized, and the buyers will get their orders very fast. This will bring trust and improve the quality and reliability reputation of the brand.

To be successful with SFP, vendors have to achieve Amazon‚Äôs strict criteria regarding shipping speed, order accuracy, and customer satisfaction. This ranges from same-day shipping upon receipt, shipment through only approved Amazon carriers, to provision of tracking information on all shipments.

# Offer Free Shipping on Minimum Order Value

A method for higher cart values is free shipping for purchases that are made of a certain value or amount.¬†

More than one product might be bought so that an order with a single item may now be made up of more than one item, making it multi-item, instead of having only one. Not only is the cost burden of shipping less for customers, but also increases profit for the seller.

* For example, a retailer specializing in fitness equipment may offer free shipping above $25. A customer who was going to buy only a yoga mat decides to order resistance bands or a water bottle to meet the $25 threshold for free shipping, thus increasing the order price and saving the customer perceived additional money, even if actually, the shipping price went into the product itself.

For application, monitor the AOV and implement the free shipping in a little above that rate because it can make the impulse to shop big.¬†

Apply visible free shipping to your¬†[Amazon product listing](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-listing-optimization)¬†and storefront and use the recommended products/bundles so as to trigger their impulse buy for other commodities.

# Bundle Products to Qualify for Free Shipping

Bundling products is an excellent way to add value to customers and encourage more orders. Customers are going to see the offer as a bargain when they can purchase multiple complementary items together, so they will qualify for free shipping, which means conversion and building trust.

* A classic example is when a beauty seller offers a skincare pack that includes cleanser, moisturizer, and serum, all shipped free as a bundle. Customers buy this bundle thinking they‚Äôre getting a much better value than if they bought it piece by piece.

¬†In addition to saving customers a hassle, bundling gives sellers the ability to clear multiple products with one transaction, thus boosting inventory turn.

Analyze purchasing patterns to find out what products often go together. Highlight the saving in cost and free shipping offers on your listings to attract the offer. For example, a home d√©cor seller can bundle cushion covers, table runners, and throws. He can offer free shipping on the set.

# Ship From Multiple Locations

Shipping from multiple warehouse locations enables sellers to fill orders quickly, which helps reduce delivery times and boosts customer satisfaction. Fast shipping builds trust, especially among time-sensitive buyers who care more about quick delivery than price.

* For instance, a clothing brand using third-party fulfillment centers throughout the country will have their products delivered in 2‚Äì3 days regardless of the customer‚Äôs location. This not only fulfills the expectations of customers but also saves on shipping costs because orders are shipped from the nearest warehouse.

For the purpose of this strategy, join multi-location warehousing services providers or scale your stock visibility through¬†**Amazon FBA**. Amazon‚Äôs vast network for fulfillment guarantees fast shipment from the closest center to the buyer.¬†

In independent cases, a seller could operate through regional fulfillment centers where their stock will strategically be distributed.

# Leverage Regional Carriers for Faster Local Delivery

Regional carriers are the way to go for quick local deliveries. National shipping carriers are not as likely as regional carriers to focus strictly on a particular region as their specialty, thus knowing the local routes and having fewer delivery times.¬†

It goes a long way in selling to customers who would appreciate fast shipping while not placing a huge burden on logistical costs.

* For example, an organic snack seller teams up with a regional delivery service to ensure same-day delivery within its state. A seller partnering with a known local carrier reduces the delivery speed but at an affordable cost; it thus attracts customers with speedy delivery, which is sure to encourage more business.

Identify regional carriers with good delivery records within your target areas. Gather customer reviews and carrier performance metrics to choose partners who have a history of delivering on time and accurately.

¬†You can also negotiate competitive rates with these carriers based on the volume of shipments in the region.

# Highlight Free and Fast Shipping in Your Listings

Visibility is the key to free and fast shipping offers. This allows Amazon to highlight these benefits in their listings so that shoppers notice them right away and increases their confidence in making a purchase.

¬†Shoppers often give preference to products with clear and upfront shipping promises, especially if they are running short on time or are looking for more value added.

* For instance, a travel backpack seller uses the phrase ‚ÄúFast and Free Shipping‚Äù in the title of the product. This will catch the attention of time-conscious buyers immediately, and the assurance of speedy delivery at no cost will give them confidence in making purchases.

Apply this by using brief yet effective language for your¬†[product titles](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/writing-balanced-product-title-features/), descriptions, and bullet points. For example, add phrases like ‚ÄúDelivered in 2 Days‚Äù or ‚ÄúFree Shipping Included.‚Äù

¬†Make sure your shipping promises will not be disappointed because actual delivery times will disappoint your customers and cause bad reviews.

# Streamline Your Shipping Process

Efficient shipping operations are an important determinant of meeting the expectations of customers for rapid delivery. By streamlining the process of order processing, creating labels, and tracking, sellers ensure quicker fulfillment with fewer delays, thus raising trust and satisfaction.

* A seller selling pet supplies uses a shipping software solution to automate order assignment to the nearest warehouse and generate shipping labels instantaneously. It has a tremendous impact in reducing order processing time and overall delivery speed.

This would require tools such as ShipStation, Veeqo, or¬†[Amazon‚Äôs Seller Central](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-vendor-central-vs-amazon-seller-central-which-is-right-for-you/)¬†shipping workflow for the automation of repeated processes. Some of the automation will also be involved with tracking inventories, batch orders, and using the cheapest¬†[shipping options](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-select-the-best-amazon-shipping-option-for-your-product/)¬†that match the address of the recipient.

Also, optimize your packaging process. Pre Packaged popular items or bundles to avoid wasting too much time in assembling them. Train your staff or partners to handle shipments with efficiency and a minimum error rate.

# Absorb Shipping Costs Strategically

Free shipping is a competitive benefit, but absorbing shipping can be done in such a manner that ensures profitability. Sometimes, it is possible through the adjustment of product price, setting minimum order levels, or free shipping can be restricted to high margin items.

* For instance, a seller of high-quality office chairs includes shipping charges in the price of the product. Labeling the item as ‚ÄúFree Shipping Included‚Äù attracts buyers since it makes the calculation of the total cost straightforward.¬†

A customer is likely to rely on a seller that offers transparent pricing than on one that separates shipping costs during checkout.

You would use this strategy to identify the areas in your business where you can afford to absorb shipping costs and make necessary adjustments. High-margin products will be directly sold by free shipping, thereby directly drawing the buyers without impacting the bottom line much.

¬†In cases of low-margin products, consider setting a minimum order value for free shipping or bundling items to increase profitability.

# Why Trust Signals Like ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs Choice‚Äù Matter

# Boosts Credibility Instantly

Instant credibility symbol with badge \\‚ÄùAmazon‚Äôs Choice‚Äù. This¬†[label goes to a product](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/selling-private-labe-products/)¬†based upon high rating, positive comments, good price, availability for immediate shipping.¬†

And for buyers, it plays the role of shortcut from which a buyer can opt for the best product offered in that category without lengthy research work.

* A customer looking for noise-canceling headphones comes across two products with nearly identical features and prices. The ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs Choice‚Äù product looks more credible, so the shopper opts for it over the unlabeled one.

How It Increases Trust:

Customers view this badge as an endorsement by Amazon itself, which helps them trust the product and ensure its quality and reliability. It removes any doubts for first-time customers or consumers who are not familiar with a specific brand.

# Reduces Buying Anxiety

Online shoppers often feel uncertain about the quality or suitability of a product. The ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs Choice‚Äù badge reduces this anxiety by pointing out products that meet strict criteria, such as positive user feedback and overall value.

* For instance, a customer looking to buy a coffee maker might be convinced by the ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs Choice‚Äù badge on one of the products and make the purchase over other alternatives due to the feeling that this is a safer, better-informed choice.

How It Generates Trust:

This badge streamlines the decision-making process because customers feel that the product has been vetted well among other shoppers, reducing their fear of making a wrong purchase.

# Signals Superior Customer Experience

Products with the ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs Choice‚Äù badge usually have accompanying features that enhance the customer‚Äôs experience, such as fast shipment (Prime eligibility) or excellent return policies. They are therefore more attractive for shoppers who consider convenience and customers‚Äô support as part of purchasing.

* A laptop charger shopper selects a product with the badge because this product assures one-day delivery using¬†[Amazon Prime](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-prime-day-2024-what-to-expect/), so when an emergency arises, they can promptly get their item.

The badge that is associated with smooth experiences in shopping, including fast delivery and easy return, develops trust and increases buying again.

# Expresses Customer Approval

The ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs Choice‚Äù badge is offered through the algorithm of¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†considering reviews and ratings made by the customers. With great consistency in high ratings, an overall positive review could place that product in recognition from the algorithm, with customer approval.

* When the buyer is browsing, thousands of positive reviews alongside this badge on a skincare product immediately grabs their attention. How It Builds Trust

Seeing the badge will assure prospective customers that others have indeed had a good experience with the product, thus enhancing their trust and likelihood of buying it.

# Demonstrates Amazon‚Äôs Confidence in Your Product

By giving an ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs Choice‚Äù badge, Amazon is telling its customers that it believes in the quality, value, and performance of a product. This confidence inspires the shopper to buy the item.

* A customer sees a kitchen gadget as ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs Choice,‚Äù and even if it‚Äôs from a lesser-known brand, he or she will automatically trust it.

How Trust Is Built:

Customers depend on Amazon‚Äôs endorsement when buying something from a new brand or category.

# Increases Conversion Rates

The badge increases the perceived value of a product, meaning higher click-through and conversion rates. Shoppers are likely to explore and buy a product carrying the ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs Choice‚Äù label more than a similar one without it.

* Vacuum cleaners with the badge will get much more clicks on search results, thereby making the seller earn much more sales.

How It Develops Trust:

The more visibility and authority the badge carries, the more customers feel they are making a smart and well-informed purchase.

# Encourages Loyal Customers

If customers enjoy a product with the ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs Choice‚Äù label, they are more likely to become repeat buyers. The badge reinforces their trust in Amazon‚Äôs recommendations, fostering long-term loyalty.

* A customer does come back to the seller again to buy matching accessories for her office chair after purchasing her first well-reviewed office chair bearing the badge.

What is built is trust into both the product and into the seller to make him her go-to guy, going forward.

# Why Trust Signals Like ‚ÄúPrime Eligible‚Äù Matter

# Improves Product Visibility in Search Results

Visibility is necessary for success on Amazon, and the ‚ÄúPrime Eligible‚Äù badge plays a significant role in enhancing one‚Äôs product‚Äôs visibility on search. Amazon‚Äôs algorithm favors ‚ÄúPrime Eligible‚Äù products, ranking those higher and displaying them in searches more often.¬†

As a result, shoppers will filter their results to reflect only items that have earned this badge, giving ‚ÄúPrime Eligible‚Äù an enormous competitive edge.

The greater visibility leads directly to increased clicks and conversion rates. Products carrying the ‚ÄúPrime Eligible‚Äù badge are also easier to locate, yet more attractive to customers, who want products that have fast and reliable delivery.

* For example, a customer looking for a smartwatch will only want to see products with the ‚ÄúPrime Eligible‚Äù filter, which shows only those products that come with fast shipping. As such, sellers without this badge are excluded from results, while those with this badge have a higher probability of being purchased.

# Aligns with Amazon‚Äôs Trusted Brand Image

Amazon has become the trusted brand name in the globe that reflects reliability, convenience, and top-notch customer services.¬†

This is a great badge for the sellers to associate the products they sell with¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†since the customer will be assured that this product is based on high standards of delivery by Amazon, quality of service, and hassle-free return options.

This trust signal is particularly crucial to smaller or newer brands in an already competitive marketplace. People are likely to not want to spend their hard-earned money with a brand that they‚Äôve never heard of on something valuable or even vital.¬†

But when the ‚ÄúPrime Eligible‚Äù badge connects the product to Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment, most of the skepticism evaporates. Buyers trust that even if they‚Äôve never heard of this brand before, it is going to meet Amazon‚Äôs standards of quality and dependability.

* A startup offering kitchen gadgets labels its offerings as ‚ÄúPrime Eligible.‚Äù A customer looking to buy a vegetable chopper sees the badge and feels comfortable buying from this up-and-coming seller since Amazon will get it to the customer on time and address any issues that may come up.

# Appeals to Last-Minute Shoppers

The ‚ÄúPrime Eligible‚Äù badge serves best for last-minute shoppers who want products delivered urgently. To such customers, the ability to receive an item within one or two days‚Äîor even the same day‚Äîis the deciding factor in making a purchase.

This trust signal proves critical, especially during busy shopping periods, emergencies, or urgent purchases. Shoppers browsing through items they need are more likely to filter their results so only ‚ÄúPrime Eligible‚Äù products are viewed, guaranteeing that anything viewed can meet their tight deadline.

* For instance, a parent may realize that the day before school that their child requires notebooks and pencils. Rather than venturing into a physical store, this parent will find school supplies on¬†**Amazon FBA**, filter to show only items ‚ÄúPrime Eligible‚Äù. The badge indicates that their orders will arrive within the time period set making it easy to buy through online channels with minimal hustle.

# How a Amazon Secure Checkout Process Encourages Trust

# Clear and Transparent Pricing

Amazon is really good at providing a breakdown of the cost before finalizing a purchase. Transparency is one important factor that will be needed to develop trust since customers will be able to see exactly how much they will pay for the product, including taxes, shipping fees, and any discount or promotion applied.

When a customer clicks ‚ÄúPlace your order,‚Äù they will have already been able to review the total amount of their purchase with an itemized summary.

* For example, if a customer is buying a pair of headphones,¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†will clearly show the item price, estimated shipping cost based on the delivery address of the customer, and applicable taxes.¬†

It will also provide the customer with the option to review or change the delivery method and any promo codes so that there are no hidden charges. This openness removes confusion and discourages the chances of misplacing a customer because his purchase will not bring them an unwanted surprise when settling their accounts.

# Customer Reviews and Seller Ratings

Customer reviews¬†and ratings for sellers contribute a crucial aspect to the checkout experience of Amazon. This proves social proof to the consumers and helps them make well-informed purchase decisions.¬†

Through the inclusion of such feedback on product pages, potential buyers can judge the product or seller‚Äôs credibility prior to finalizing their buying decision.

The review system of Amazon FBA allows the customers to read detailed feedback from others who have purchased the same item. It helps build trust by giving insights into how the product performs, whether it is durable, and its overall satisfaction.¬†

Reviews also include pros and cons as well as real-world experiences that a potential buyer may not consider otherwise.

* For instance, a buyer might read through hundreds of reviews describing the features, performance, and ease of use of a kitchen blender before he or she decides to purchase one.

1muihf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_D_techno_life/comments/1muihf9/life_no_longer_silenced/,Life No Longer Silenced,"Ever since birth, I was surrounded by toxicity, especially my family. Narcissism, physical / mental / sexual abuse, manipulation, rape, molestation, gaslighting, empty words, lies, selfish action, broken promises to name a few taken towards myself, that also continues through adulthood. Many of my memories are in accessible and what I can tell..... many negative than positive. I can go as back as I think 3 - 4 in my memories, the time I was in Iowa. I remember a bunk bed being built, falling out of it in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. A waterbed in the basement, scar on my leg from the messed up bumper of my uncle's truck, moving day to leave and, the earliest incident of my father's sexual abuse towards me. After that, my memories are in Missouri start, and they are with me living in a trailer. I remember my brother antagonizing me and not leaving me along, I chase him and I trip to hit my face on the TV stand.

All my life I feel like people just love to antagonize me when I just dislike childish behavior and dumb antics. People constantly pushing my boundaries and when I point out how I dislike it, their behavior gets worse and more hostility towards me. I am a narcissist magnet, and me being happy makes others uncomfortable. All my life I get get to be the villain because of having boundaries while being good, so which is it. Too many narratives people have created or caused through their actions. Later on, I vaguely remember preschool. All the teachers I had in Missouri were so rude and uncaring. Always taking the side of bullies, especially when they would run to the teacher and tell the teacher that I bullied them. Then comes elementary school in a small town, my father's abuse, in all forms, becomes much, much worse. I

discovered he's also touching my brother. My brother's anger and toxic behavior starts to become worse at this time. Then add my mother's abuse, though I am not sure if starts at this time, but it is the earliest I remember. Mother's go to, age didn't matter, was yelling in your face or ear, digging nails in arms or thighs till blood form, smacking in the head, smacking or kicking in the ass and, mental abuse. I'd have bruises all my life from family, bullies, and plus a couple of exes. Plus at this time the slavery starts, I'd understand chore work but to do everything around the house, even the adult stuff while they spoil themselves and abuse their children, bad parenting. Plus, they would let my siblings do nothing and forcing me to do more chores. My brother would antagonize me or yell at everyone, steal and, other bad behavior. I would also escape from my parents and siblings, doing sleepovers at relatives houses. Elementary school also sadly introduced fake friends, people that used me and my kindness.

Becoming the quiet loner, didn't work. I was then becoming angrier and having extreme trust issues, nowhere to vend but video games. I started to defend my self with fists, since words never worked on teachers on bullies. I was always taller and never followed fade, I absolutely hate celebrity worshiping. I just want to enjoy their shows, that is it. Growing up, I would never follow a fade or a social norm, just enjoyed what I liked. I ended up being the lone wolf, since I would bark or bite back. A black wolf in the family and world will stand out and defend themselves. Sadly it also caused me to be an obese child, depression, processed foods and, junk. Later I on, I discovered health issues I had since childhood that my parents ignored.

More of my time in my early childhood years, worse abuse from my father and bullies, teachers uncaring behaviors and disrespect towards students becomes worse as well, then I discover teachers playing favorites. Small town like is not that great. My sister was being spoiled, she became such a brat. If she didn't get her way, she would lie to get her way. The result would be, my brother or I in trouble. Then I find out my father is also abusing her. Then in middle school bullies are making me bleed now and school system not caring. Mother went further one time and screamed in my ear but bit my ear. My father would beat me and my brother but never my sister in front of anyone. He would never spank, mostly beat, but he would include a belt, two by four, hockey stick, baseball bat, whatever that was within reach.  One morning I get up to go to school, my brother was already awake and told me he was sick. He turns around and buys porn on the satellite.

Well guess what, I am the one to get in trouble and blamed for it. At one time, my brother and I were force to do the entire household's laundry. Well my brother was being an ass and only folding towels, shoving clothes in the other basket thinking I wasn't looking and, so as brothers we fought. Our father wasn't happy with that, came out to do so-called discipline on us. He beat us and threw us into a glass top coffee table with large glass candleholders, my chest has massive bruises and minor scraps on my arms. All the glass was broke, we were lucky. We were too scared to tell anyone, we were told to tell lies. Then there is a moment when I really snapped after one incident with my father, he did something; I yelled at him and hit him and ran, finally trapping myself under my bed till my mother came home. I was still scared of him cause of the abuse. Then I end up living with my grandparents and going to a different school. I guess I had my first girlfriend, but it wasn't anything really, and didn't get to talk to her.

One time a bully pushed me down some stairs and thankfully only ended up with a sprain in my ankle. I was rolling down the stairs and a kid ran and jumped down past me as I was tumbling, ignoring me. As usual, school did nothing about it. So same stuff but more bully violence, different school and, learning about the bad habits of my mother received from her parents. She lied to the school system and had to live back with my parents. Another new school, more bad teachers, perverted students, bullies. Triggering moment with my brother and sister that hurt me, causing me to not trust anyone... ever. At that time I really start to struggle in handling everything. The stress, the abuse, being ignored, belittled and, no one to turn to or talk to and, their want in controlling every aspect of my life. Nail-biting all my life from the stress, doing better with it now. Always the misunderstood outcast and never a real friend. And every time it was the false friends that would take advantage of my kindness, and be selfish of my time, using me.

I was giving them rides to places, rarely ever get to do anything I like and sometimes shared interests might overlap, but I could still miss some things. Also lose money in all the bullshit I experienced. Developing poor social skills and wanting more to be a loner. Middle school girls are just as perverted as boys. All they would do is talk about sex and penises, while drawing body parts in the sand. They would tease me and push me to show mine, all I did was blush and try to ignore them. Teacher would never believe me when I would tell them, here is an early moment girls are believed over boys. Gender doesn't matter, toxicity in all.

I went home one day after school and mom force me to watch an Oprah special. It was on incest/pedophilia and a switch was flipped. I no longer wanted to lie, I always wanted to tell the truth and be honest, though recently I was told I was come of too rough even though I am honest. Still working on being a better me. I went to tell my mother everything; I ended up leaving school and living with her parents again, failed home-schooling. She didn't divorce him and still lived with him and with my siblings, my brother and sister became more toxic.

I am the only one to at work through my trauma, long time though. Still I was people pleasing, taking false outside acceptance, and false love. I then at one time my thoughts on suicide became really bad and I cut myself. That did absolutely nothing, it added more physical pain on top of the other physical pain and emotional. Also ended up hating myself and belittle myself. Wearing adult men's clothing in middle school with being overweight. One happiness I lost at an early age was my Uncle Keith, he was to loving and caring. Made me felt like I was important and never hurt me like any other family member. Others would change or act different around him.

At one point in middle school I started a lawn business to be able to have the stuff I want and need, sadly my brother ruined it for me after my parents force me to include him and split the money. Eventually I find out my aunt said, her brother, my dad did same stuff to her and no one believed her. She talked to me about it and then  right after attack me, plus all male members of the family but her husband and sons. Eventually I turn eighteen and start officially working for corporation's and do an adult education program. I learned real fast that nothing changed. Bullies just like in school, are now abusive slave driving bosses and, more gossiping/rumor's. So many jobs love to violate human rights, federal laws, labor rights, false hiring practices, osha violations. Many businesses complain about about not keeping employees and having bad customers. Treat everyone better.  I even had toxic female boss', racist boss', all with a false open door policy, sexist male/female co-workers, false me-too co-workers, thief's, racists, ones that enjoy causing pain in others.

2016 was a tough year, I was run over by a car thief, that is all I know. I am still missing 24 hours of memory missing, but it still affects me. Every day, I am in chronic pain, headaches, and nerve pain in my left limbs and, mostly, my spine. I had two severe brain concussions based on how the doctor worded it. One on the front left lobe and one on the back left lobe. It gets worse during high heat advisories and bad rainstorm, so when the pressure in the atmosphere gets high or heat making the pain worse. Sometimes I dissociate and others think I am tired when I try to hide the pain. I try to ignore the pain caused by others while dealing with my own physical pain. I do well enough to work though all my traumas, and I will own up to my mistakes. One disappointing element is discovering past people, even the toxic ones stalking me on social media, I have no idea what is hoped to be found. I am me and will always be unique. No fa√ßade, just a human with emotions and confidence person that cares about the health and safety of others. I never want others to go through pain, especially what I have and still do. This is some chunks of what I can remember, and more and more might come out. I have made mistake, even bad ones. I still cry, and I think that makes me human.  Even after all the past (and current) mistreatment and abuse, I still choose to be kind and noticing I perform altruistic acts for others.  I accept who I am and who I am becoming. More love is needed in the world, and I will keep sharing it. Just can't fix the RBF and face subtitles.

Doctors suck and lie. State sucks and Lies, blocking my victim rights. All the jobs face sucks, not a good one. Especially since they pushed me with my pain getting worse. I am now walking with a cane. No job wants to hire me with a cane but I just need help for now. I am unemployed, living with my mothers parents. They are in their 80's and do my best to help. Putting money into the house, appliances and other stuff; when I was working. Their memories are getting worse, more so my grandfather. He has bladder cancer that had spread to his bones. My grandmother had a mastectomy but good now, with regular check-ups. I even got myself a MMJ card for the pain but I will be stopping that and my cellphone. Only money I get now is from plasma. Our internet sucks and constantly going out, ATT sucks. We are wanting to leave Florida, it is so bad here in every way. I am on an older laptop that can get hot quickly and my pc SSD is corrupt. I tried fixing it and failed, tried to install on an m.2 and failed.  I asked for help for so many problems and ignored but when I am asked, I never hesitate. This in my story, if anyone can help, we would greatly appreciate. Donations, amazon purchases for necessities' or, any advice. I will be grateful but please, no trolling or fake advice.

1muidsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerOnReviews/comments/1muidsj/explore_the_best_food_grinder_cuisinart_ech4sv/,Explore the Best Food Grinder Cuisinart ECH-4SV Worth Buying,"Testing the Cuisinart ECH-4SV Elemental Chopper Grinder has been nothing short of a daily adventure in my kitchen. I am someone who loves experimenting with recipes, whether it‚Äôs whipping up fresh salsa, mincing garlic, or blending sauces. This compact chopper and grinder promises convenience, versatility, and efficiency, and after using it for weeks now, I have plenty to share about its real-life performance. While it gets many things right, there are a few quirks worth noting.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my eye was its sleek silver design, which feels modern and sophisticated enough to leave out on the countertop. It‚Äôs surprisingly compact at just 5.6 inches deep and 9.3 inches tall, meaning it barely takes up any counter space in my already crowded kitchen. Weighing only 3.3 pounds is also a major bonus‚Äîforget lugging around anything bulky. One thing I really appreciated was the 4-cup capacity bowl. It‚Äôs not enormous, but it strikes the perfect balance of accommodating most of my cooking needs without feeling unnecessarily large. The tactile touchpad controls for chopping and grinding add a fancy, techy touch. The overall build feels sturdy, and the stainless steel blade just screams durability.

**Ease of Use**  
Using this small appliance is ridiculously simple. I‚Äôm no stranger to choppers that require a master‚Äôs degree to assemble, but this one? Just place the bowl on, set in the blade, and lock the lid with ease. One thing worth noting is that the chopper will not turn on unless the blade and lid are securely in place. While this might frustrate some, I find this safety feature reassuring, especially with curious kids around. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade is a clever addition. It switches between a sharp edge for softer foods and a blunt edge for tougher ones when grinding. For me, this meant finely minced herbs one moment and ground coffee beans the next‚Äîall without switching gadgets. Meals‚Äîand coffee‚Äînever felt this effortless.

**Positives**  
- User-friendly and compact design perfect for small kitchens.  
- Versatile auto-reversing blade for chopping softer ingredients and grinding harder items.  
- The BladeLock system keeps everything securely in place during use.  
- Dishwasher-safe removable parts make cleanup a non-issue.

[Check Cuisinart ECH-4SV Elemental Chopper Grinder price on Amazon.](https://mgplab.com/p/b074mqfr55/)

**Performance in Everyday Scenarios**  
This little machine has been my go-to for pureeing soups, whipping up hummus, and even chopping onions (yes, fewer post-meal onion tears!). I like that the motor feels powerful without being obnoxiously loud. The SmartPower blade does a solid job of pureeing and grinding, although it feels slightly underpowered for rock-hard nuts unless pulsed gradually in small batches. It‚Äôs not trying to be a full-sized food processor, so tempering expectations here is key. I noticed consistent results with chopping softer ingredients like tomatoes and carrots, and the texture exceeded my expectations for such a compact gadget.

**Drawbacks**  
- Limited four-cup bowl capacity; great for small batches but not for large-scale cooking.  
- Grinding harder ingredients like nuts or seeds sometimes takes longer than expected.  
- The machine won‚Äôt operate unless everything is perfectly locked, which may annoy impatient users.  

**BladeLock System and Safety Features**  
The BladeLock system has been a standout feature for me. I‚Äôve used other choppers where blades seem to have a life of their own, flinging out mid-pour. Here, the blade stays locked in securely, preventing any unfortunate kitchen mishaps. Pouring out sauces or soups directly from the bowl has been smooth and worry-free. It‚Äôs an underrated feature that adds convenience while removing the I-need-a-third-hand dilemma. Again, the safety-first design, which requires all parts to be locked in place, has put me at ease amid the chaos of cooking.

**Competing Products**  
How does this stack up against similar products in its league? Let‚Äôs compare it to the Ninja Express Chop and the KitchenAid Mini Chopper. While the Ninja offers similar simplicity, it lacks the BladeLock system, making pouring a bit trickier. On the other hand, KitchenAid‚Äôs comparable model feels slightly heftier and seems better suited for tackling heavier-duty tasks with its larger bowl capacity. However, the Cuisinart wins with its SmartPower blade functionality, especially when dealing with delicate slicing versus rough grinding. If compactness and versatility are prioritized, this one takes the crown among its peers.

**Affordable Quality**  
Looking at it from a cost-to-quality perspective, this model offers plenty for its price bracket. While it doesn‚Äôt claim to replace a full-sized processor, it handles those in-between tasks beautifully and takes up nearly no space doing it. This makes it ideal for smaller households or kitchens like my own, where countertop appliances often need to multitask. Its focus on both form and function without an exorbitant price tag makes it an enticing choice for experimenting home cooks who demand quality without breaking the bank.

I posted my [first query + 300](https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1m7yabl/qcrit_four_letter_words_adult_contemporary/) a few weeks ago asking for help in how to trim the query for length. I didn't get much feedback about trimming it but I DID get feedback on the content, namely that my first 300 started a little slow and parts of the query felt disjointed.

I rewrote my opening scene and revised my query, constructive feedback is always appreciated.

**Query:**

Dear *AGENT*,

Exploring mental health, body positivity and the meaning of family, FOUR LETTER WORDS is a 99,000-word enemies-to-lovers adult contemporary romance set in vibrant, bustling London. It‚Äôs perfect for fans of the workplace shenanigans in Sally Thorne‚Äôs *The Hating Game*, the biting banter of Emily Henry‚Äôs *Book Lovers*, with a voice similar to Talia Hibbert.¬†

Financial analyst Olivia Baker is a workaholic in denial, climbing the corporate ladder fueled by ambition and chocolate-covered coffee beans. When Olivia learns her boss is being promoted, Olivia puts herself forward to replace her, a position that would make her the first Black head of their department and put her on the fast track to funding her dream: a community centre for underprivileged youth she‚Äôd sketched out with her father before he unexpectedly passed away.¬†

Half-Malaysian, half-White reformed playboy Chris Westbury is newly sober and desperate to redeem himself in the eyes of his upper-class family, and puts himself in the running for the same promotion. Forced to work together, they clash in their attempts to demonstrate leadership and maturity while each trying to prove they‚Äôre the best person for the job. Cue the sparks... and the competition. The more time they spend together, the more they find themselves drawn to one another, walking the knife-edge of desire. A business trip to Paris brings the simmering tension to a boil, and they give in to their inconvenient attraction‚Äì just this once.¬†

*Just this once* was never going to be enough. The pair find themselves trading witty barbs both in and out of the bedroom‚Äîand fighting their growing mutual affection tooth and nail. Starting an office fling while vying for the same promotion can‚Äôt possibly end well‚Ä¶ Can it?

With the promotion around the corner, and errant feelings threatening to collapse their delicate house of cards, the pair must decide if personal sacrifice is worth finally achieving professional fulfilment, or if their ambitions are getting in the way of something real.

**FIRST 300:**

If one more cocksucking thing went wrong, Olivia Baker was going to fling herself into the path of the next oncoming bus.

She‚Äôd gotten a text from her boss, Madison, asking her to come in earlier than usual, and so, running on four hours of sleep and a breakfast of chocolate-covered coffee beans, Olivia had rushed off to work. It was pouring with rain, adding a new layer to London‚Äôs usual grime. Her hair had started to frizz out of her hastily braided bun, and her edges were lifting. That new organic styling mousse her sister had given her could go fuck itself; her hair needed industrial-strength holding gel to keep it in place.

She scurried through the glass and steel lobby of Stratford Gold to the lifts on the far side. As the doors closed, a fancy leather shoe shot into the gap. They slid open once again, and in stepped the last person Olivia wanted to see that morning.

Chris Westbury.

The gum underneath her new shoe made manifest.

Corporate nepotism hire and the company golden boy.

‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù he drawled, as the doors slid smoothly shut. ‚ÄúIf it isn‚Äôt London‚Äôs busiest little bee.‚Äù

‚ÄúWestbury,‚Äù Olivia said by way of reluctant greeting, stabbing at the ‚Äò23‚Äô button like it would speed up their ascent. Chris gave her a slow once-over, eyes lingering just long enough to irritate. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt start.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúSleep well last night?‚Äù

She arched her brow. ‚ÄúLike a baby.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh. Waking up screaming every hour, then.‚Äù

Olivia scowled, though he wasn‚Äôt far off. ‚ÄúIf anyone‚Äôs sleep patterns should be under the microscope it‚Äôs yours; that email you sent came through at three in the morning.‚Äù

He grinned sharply, like the shark in that fish film she‚Äôd put on with Briar‚Äôs kids last week. ‚ÄúWitching hour, and all that.‚Äù",2,1755609893.0,PubTips,0,0.75,False
1muiczj,https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1muiczj/my_workplace_is_absolutely_disgusting/,My workplace is absolutely disgusting,"I don‚Äôt even know where to start. I work in a small office with 5 other women and the place is filthy. We supposedly have ‚Äúcleaners‚Äù but they don‚Äôt actually clean anything.

The bathroom is the worst. Every single day there are doodoo stains left on the toilet or period blood smeared on the seat. They don‚Äôt flush toilet paper, they just throw it in the trash can, so when you walk in you‚Äôre immediately greeted by shitty or bloody toilet paper and the whole bathroom reeks. They even use toilet seat liners to sit down, then pull them out of the bowl and walk them over to the trash can while pissy water drips all over the floor on the way there. And how do I know this? Because they literally told me this is what they do. They‚Äôve also told me not to flush toilet paper because this is ‚Äútheir system.‚Äù On top of that, they pee on the floor and don‚Äôt clean it up.

The rest of the office isn‚Äôt any better. They all wear wigs and weaves, so there are clumps of hair everywhere‚Äîsticking to my shoes to the point I‚Äôve peeled wig glue off my sandal before. The microwave has never been cleaned. People heat food or coffee, it explodes, and they just leave it. I once put my food in and set my container down right in a puddle of old coffee. They peel eggs or food over the sink and leave the shells and scraps there until the drain clogs and water just sits in the bottom. They eat in the breakroom, leave crumbs everywhere, and never wipe up after themselves.

And the ‚Äúcleaners‚Äù? One time we caught one on camera wiping down the toilet and then using the exact same rag on our desks. Instead of firing him, management just took down the cameras so we couldn‚Äôt see anymore. It even got so bad we went an entire month without a working toilet.

I work in a small office with 5 other women and the place is filthy. We supposedly have ‚Äúcleaners‚Äù but they don‚Äôt clean anything.

The bathroom is the worst:
	‚Ä¢	Every day there are doodoo stains left on the toilet or period blood smeared on the seat.
	‚Ä¢	They don‚Äôt flush toilet paper‚Äîjust throw it in the trash can, so you‚Äôre immediately greeted by shitty or bloody toilet paper and the whole bathroom reeks.
	‚Ä¢	They use toilet seat liners to sit on the toilet, then pull them out of the bowl and walk them over to the trash can while they drip pissy water all over the floor. And how do I know all of this, you ask? Because they literally told me this is what they do. They even tell me not to flush toilet paper‚Äîbecause this is their ‚Äúsystem.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Pee on the floor is a regular thing, and of course no one cleans it up.

Around the office isn‚Äôt any better:
	‚Ä¢	They all wear wigs/weaves so clumps of hair are always on the floor, sticking to my shoes (I literally peeled wig glue off my sandal the other day).
	‚Ä¢	The microwave has never been cleaned. People heat food or coffee, it explodes, and they just leave it. I once sat my container right in a puddle of old coffee.
	‚Ä¢	They peel eggs/food over the sink, clogging it with shells and food until water just sits in there.
	‚Ä¢	They eat in the breakroom and leave crumbs everywhere.

And the ‚Äúcleaners‚Äù? We once caught one on camera wiping the toilet and then using the same rag on our desks. Instead of firing him, management just took the cameras down so we couldn‚Äôt see anymore.

It got so bad we went without a working toilet for a whole month, and management told us to pee in a bucket and pour it down the sink. I wish I was joking.

Then there‚Äôs the manager, who is honestly the WORST part of it all.

Oh yeah, and now they‚Äôve told us none of us will be getting raises‚Äîeven though I haven‚Äôt had one in two years. All they‚Äôve done is fire people and pile their work onto me with no extra pay. Then they expect us to work overtime. If you come in 15 minutes late, they make you stay 15 minutes after work to ‚Äúmake up‚Äù your 8 hours.

When I was about 21 or 22 I was at my thinnest, I believe 125 lbs. Most was due to anxiety and not eating, so then I went on medication (zoloft) and since then gained a good 40 pounds. Now I tapered off my anxiety meds as I initially thought they were the cause. But I‚Äôm feeling okay anxiety wise but now struggling with my eating.

Everyone has the tip of ‚Äúdo not buy snacks‚Äù which thought would be great for me as I live alone and could save the money. But NOPE. I make everything that‚Äôs sitting in my fridge or pantry! 

I will physically get up, make cookies, brownies, etc. from scratch. Make anything in the air fryer, so things in my freezer - in which I even stopped buying fries and deep fried stuff. But I still manage to make whatever is left in there. I do buy fruits and veggies which I eat lots of. 

I usually get an iced coffee sugar free when I go out but end up buying a small snack with it too. So obviously that needs to stop. Some of socializing with friends is through going and trying new restaurants or cafes (which is usually once every week). 

The issue is that my brain automatically just goes right to food and I don‚Äôt even realize it till I‚Äôm already half way cooking/baking. Then I feel awful about myself. 

Like I‚Äôll basically eat anything. I also work from home and I tend to do lots of hobbies that are at home. Hard to distract myself when much of my work and hobbies are in my own home. 

I haven‚Äôt really found anyone bring up that they just unconsciously start eating? Everywhere on tiktok, Reddit etc. just say to cut out snacks to stop it.

Last Wednesday I got a call from
Police that a family member had been found deceased. She was 63 years old. The reason police called me was, they couldn‚Äôt reach her husband. I am the only other relative she has in Australia, she‚Äôs from Europe. I then called and spoke to the husband , and he said ‚Äúbetter you deal with it‚Äù ‚Ä¶ he didn‚Äôt want to speak to them about his wives death‚Ä¶ strange. 

Well this husband , left 8 years ago, for work in Thailand ‚Ä¶ this work, resulted in a fraud charge being laid on him here in Australia so he moved to New Zealand (had a new Zealand passport) basically he left 8 years ago. Just so happens he met a much younger woman ( less than half his age) in Thailand , moved her to New Zealand with him in 2017‚Ä¶ now this whole 8 years he has told his wife in Australia that he is coming back, he‚Äôs just waiting for his legal issues to go away. I have many times asked why can‚Äôt she come and live with you (as have other family members overseas) and he said, she didn‚Äôt want to. We have since found out and have text and emails proving she asked many times to go and he denied her. His wife that died had for sure some kind of untreated mental health condition, she was extremely religious (I‚Äôm
Religious) but it went beyond the pale of normal crossing to some kind of mental problem. So much so she wouldn‚Äôt see doctors. Watch tv. Talk about anything other than religion‚Ä¶ shut herself away from friends and other people ‚Ä¶ and became more and more apparent she needed help. Again myself and other family members told him this,
Many times and he said she was fine and of sound mind. I believe the reason he didn‚Äôt divorce her is he didn‚Äôt want to have to give her any money. Before he left she lived a nice life, with a nice home, and comfortable living. He left her. With nothing she got evicted, ended up in public housing ‚Ä¶ and whenever I saw her since he‚Äôs been gone we always met at
My place or coffee shops so I didn‚Äôt know just how bad it was until cleaning out her place after her death. She had no fridge, no mattress just a single metal bed frame with folded blankets as a mattress. No furniture except one plastic chair. Meanwhile he is living in a million dollar property on the water in nz. 
She believed him and trusted him the whole 8 years that they were still married and he loved her and he was coming back, and he never was going to come back. 
Now to her death ‚Ä¶ well firstly ,  when she was found she had been dead for 6 weeks. I couldn‚Äôt believe it and actually doubted they had got the right person as she told me she spoke to her husband daily so surely he would have called me if he couldn‚Äôt contact her for so long. When I called him he said ‚ÄúI spoke to her yesterday‚Äù - I said are you sure because the police said it‚Äôs been weeks, he then admitted it was 6 weeks ago, when I asked why he wasn‚Äôt concerned and didn‚Äôt contact anyone , he said ‚ÄúI was concerned because the last time we spoke, we used to always talk for at least 10
Minutes but our last phone call she sounded weak and was speaking slow and said she needed to go lay down‚Äù OK so then she went radio silent for 6 weeks and you did nothing ?

Secondly , his refusal, or not even wanting to speak to anyone ‚Ä¶ he hasn‚Äôt spoken to police, or the coroner I have done all of that‚Ä¶.. wouldn‚Äôt he want to know what happened to someone he was married to for 44 years ? And then today, he text me saying he had arranged her body be collected and cremated with no service as quickly as possible. I feel like it‚Äôs so disrespectful. She deserves some kind of service especially with her beliefs. 

Cause of death
Ruled heart attack. No autopsy , as they did ct scan and were happy to call it. 

My question, I feel like something here should be illegal ‚Ä¶. You can not just abandon someone who is vulnerable and let them live with out basic needs while living in luxury ‚Ä¶ surely. I fully believe his actions caused her death. The neglect and lack of money. His lack
Of care and total disregard for her has turned my
Stomach ‚Ä¶ I can barely eat. 

I‚Äôm sorry for my writing, spelling , grammar ‚Ä¶. I am writing this so fast through shaking hands because I just can not believe what has happened to this poor woman. She did not deserve any of this.

I love her and I never wanted this feeling to happen. We started out hot and heavy. Falling in-love with her was an experience I never thought was possible. It was magic, it was that experience of drinking your morning coffee, it was a movie. The attraction is there, the passion is there, seeing a future with her, marriage, kids are there. But there are things that are bothering me. I am her 4th boyfriend and she is my 1st girlfriend (I was an introvert) which is a far stretch on how experienced we are in relationships. I feel like I am settling down way too early without experiencing anything else which is different for her since I am her 4th bf and she's pretty sure of me. 

She is a very beautiful girl, and we get along. But she is also very insecure that I had to cut every girl I know out of my life except for my relatives. I chose my relationship over everything, it broke friendships, and some other life changing choices, and I did all that for her. Lately, I am starting to feel like she's the only one left in my life, and that is why i'm settling. My girlfriend is also very possessive, she gets upset when I don't video call her during family gatherings that she can't join, gets angry when I don't tell her I answered a girl's question from work (she saw it via email), she gets angry when I don't post her often online (which is ridiculous since my IG is basically her fan account) she is heavily against me going to an actual gym because there are girls around so she prefers if I continue to workout on our home gym, she does not allow me to go out on my own and just suspects me cheating when I need time for myself (she goes out on her own tho, I allow her) and the one thing that seriously bothers me is how she get furious and ignores me when I go out with my family and she's not involved (There are times where I couldn't invite her because nobody else' partner was around.) I am thousands of dollars in debt because of how often she obsesses with things that I would then buy for her, but she doesn't get satisfied with it, after a few weeks she moves on to another luxurious item that she practically shoves in my face until I get it for her. I have a decent job that would honestly make me live a comfortable life but right now, I spend 70% of it on my debts because of these material things she wants. She constantly compares me to her friend's boyfriends and how submissive they are to the girls, she wants me to just follow her around and live in her world. Despite these things she is also very passionate, very funny, her laugh would make you laugh, she gets along with my family, we both get along, we're both sexually compatible, and she puts me first. Her green flags is what holds me back so I just accepted thats how it's gonna be for us.

A few days ago, we were eating out and then my heart suddenly skipped a beat, as I had seen somebody I had a fling with 3 years ago... that person represented who I was before entering this relationship. The grass was greener for 30 seconds, I had Deja Vu of how I used to be free, how I was fine being alone with my small friend group (which is nonexistent now.) How satisfied I was with my life, and now i'm just questioning it everyday. I can't stop thinking about the what ifs with this other person, I stalked them on IG. I saw that they were living the life that I wanted (Jogging alone in the city, a local gym membership, cafe hops alone, not having a responsibility, vacations, meeting different people and learning from them, Freedom...) BTW, I would never cheat on her physically.

I started to think what would happen if my gf and I broke up. I would definitely take time for myself and do things I couldn't do when I was with her. A part of me wants to end our relationship and eventually meet with my past fling just so that I can fulfill my fantasy. But then when I think about it, what will happen next? Will I fall-in-love with them? Will I get into a relationship with them? The answer was no. I was simply curious about doing the things we both wanted to do with each other that we never could have done. This fling had confessed that they were in-love with me months before my gf and I got into a relationship, and I was told they got hurt when I entered a relationship, they blocked me after I made me and my gf's relationship official online. Every time my gf treated me terribly, this person was the one person I thought about because of how gracious and kind they were towards me. But then again, how can I compare my gf who is my life partner to an on again off again fling that was mostly sexual anyway? Think of this person as my ""guilty as sin"".

I feel incredibly stuck right now. Just to be clear, I don't want to leave my gf and enter a new relationship. I just want my old life back and getting control over it again. My world now revolves around her and her approval and I hate it. I know if I bring this up she will leave me, she just won't understand how I feel. She loves me and wants to spend her life with me, I feel like I am leading her on. Settling at 25 is scaring the shit out of me. I am very inexperienced in life and I have so many things I would like to do. I am posting this here because as I mentioned, I don't have anyone else to open up to. Do I end this relationship and chase the freedom I long for? Or do I stay in this relationship having regrets, what ifs, and quietly resenting my life?

1mui551,https://www.reddit.com/r/mothuncle/comments/1mui551/i_found_an_extra_light_switch_in_my_apartment_and/,I found an extra light switch in my apartment and it ruined my life,"It‚Äôs been about seven months since I signed my year long lease for this shithole apartment. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be making it another five months. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll even make it another night. My cheapness might‚Äôve cost me my life.¬†

I was going to make this a short cry for help before I remembered that no one would ever believe me and it would be too late anyway. Hell, I wouldn‚Äôt believe this if I stumbled across it. I‚Äôll just take my time here and pour my heart out.¬†

Seven months ago, I made what I now realise was the worst decision of my life. I moved into this dumpy ass apartment building after finally making the move out of my hometown. I had romanticized the idea of escapism so much. I pictured myself in New York City or something like that, walking down the sidewalk with some overpriced coffee in my hands and my tasteful messenger bag slung around my shoulder. I‚Äôd be walking to somewhere idyllic, maybe a get-together with new friends that took an interest in me or something like that - I never made it too far into that daydream. I just wanted to get out of that little rural town. It was one of those towns that was just a road with a bunch of sad old signs along it. Blown out buildings with occasional passing silhouettes that were once somebodies.

Let‚Äôs just say I couldn‚Äôt afford New York City, but I could afford a small city a few hours from that rotting place of a town. It‚Äôs a city with some high rises and skyscrapers but nothing that‚Äôs going to put it on somebody's road trip. It‚Äôs a pretty lonely place, honestly. It‚Äôs old and tired like my hometown, but in a more industrial way. Walkability isn‚Äôt much of a reality here unless you want to take your chances with the harsh weather or the rampant mugging - so there went my sidewalk daydream.

Still, I wanted to make the most of the experience. I got an apartment right downtown for a reasonable price and figured life would improve from there on. However, I failed to truly grasp how much of a piece of shit the apartment was until I moved in. I was a little too naive at the time to understand the spectrum of stress caused by a ‚Äúlandlord special‚Äù. The door knobs would come right off, the fridge never fully shut, the toilet wouldn‚Äôt flush without some sacred jiggling sequence, and a whole mess of other inconveniences or hazards.¬†

This apartment also has a lot of strange features. The floor plan doesn‚Äôt make much sense and anyone with a shred of interior design knowledge or even just self respect would‚Äôve immediately crossed this place off their list. I was so desperate though that I didn‚Äôt mind when I entered the apartment and just saw a hallway full of closed doors. I shrugged off how strange it was that each room was contained behind one of those doors, with none of the rooms connecting to one another. The kitchen is its own closed off room, the living room too - the only way to get anywhere in the apartment was to take the central hallway. It honestly looks like one of those hallway chase shots in Scooby Doo or some shit.

For how awful the place is, it‚Äôs not small. There are a good amount of rooms, and I actually hadn‚Äôt¬† been able to fill one particular room until recently.

When you walk into the place, there‚Äôs the long hallway and then nine doors total. There‚Äôs four on the left side, four on the right, and one at the very end of the hallway. On the right side, the doors in order are the living room, a closet, then my bedroom, and then the bathroom. On the left side it starts with the kitchen, then another closet, the dining room, and a second bedroom. The ninth door in the middle is that extra room. I barely had enough stuff just to fill the other rooms and I lacked any sort of motivation to do anything with the extra room for a while. I have a corner unit so all the rooms on the right side of the apartment have windows as well as the extra room. The extra room has these neat casement windows that I like to look out of but offer little privacy. I had thought to make the extra room a sort of reading area or a home theater type deal but I was flat broke.

The extra room is strange. It‚Äôs really big and open. It feels like an apartment of its own. One night, I was in there just looking out at the other surrounding high rises when I noticed a light switch that had been painted over right next to the window. I didn‚Äôt think much of it. It was clearly just another amenity of my shithole apartment. I left it alone.

As time went on, I found myself in that extra room most nights just looking out the window. I didn‚Äôt have the money for any fancy streaming services nor friends to leech off of - so I just looked out that window most nights. It was peaceful and at night the city looked bigger and more lively. I loved seeing all the different lights, the blurry shapes of people in their own world watching their TV or making dinner. It didn‚Äôt take long for me to start picking at the paint on that hidden light switch as I watched the world wind down every night.

I‚Äôd chip away at the paint little by little with my finger while I was lost in my thoughts. It took a few days to make any sort of progress, but eventually I had peeled off enough paint to see the light switch. It was a different color than the new plain white paint that covered everything else. It was bronze and the switch itself was almost antique looking. It got me wondering how old this building was.

A few nights later the old switch was finally uncovered. It caught the light in an intoxicating way and I flipped the switch on and off a few times to see if it still worked and what it controlled. Nothing changed.¬†

The next night brought a heavy snowstorm. It was beautiful and you already know I was set up at that window staring out at the world as the brilliant snow fell. At some point, I was reminded of the bronze light switch and I flicked it, not remembering if I‚Äôd already tried it the night before. Nothing changed. I absentmindedly flicked it again and noticed something strange out of the corner of my eye. A light turned on in the building across the street.¬†

It was the rightmost room on the top floor of the neighboring high rise which was quite a bit taller than my building. At first, I just thought it was something new to look at. My hand still on the switch, I craned my neck up and leaned in to watch the new light. I lost concentration and flicked the switch down and the room‚Äôs light turned off. That caught my attention. I looked down at the switch and back up at the now dark pane of glass. I flipped the switch up and at that exact moment the room‚Äôs light turned back on.¬†

I continued doing this for probably five minutes - just flipping the switch on and off and watching as the faraway room‚Äôs light perfectly matched. The snow began falling even more, but I could still make out the light turning off and on with every flick of the old switch. I was baffled before too long. So baffled that I went right to sleep, convinced I was deprived of logic and reasoning.

The next night came and, at first, I was definitely reluctant to mess with that switch or to even go in that room. I tried staring out other windows but they were cloudy with trapped moisture. I remember thinking I should get a cat or something before I finally caved and walked into the extra room.

There was traffic on the street below from some accident that night and it provided me with enough entertainment to remain distracted from what happened the night before. The standstill row of gray cars could only stimulate me for so long before I was looking at that switch again.¬†

I flipped it.

Such a harmless action, and so quick too. Flipping a light switch. Usually done by second nature. What‚Äôs the harm in it? Why did flipping that switch feel so important?¬†

The same room from the night before lit up. It was a yellow, more vintage looking tone of light. I tried using some beaten up binoculars from my childhood but all I got was a somehow-fuzzier view of the room. From my vantage, I could only really see the ceiling of that mysterious place.

*That‚Äôs gotta be an apartment, right? It looks too big to be a storage closet. Too small to be anything commercial.*

I flipped the switch again and the light turned off in perfect succession.

*Is somebody fucking with me?*

Flip. The light came back on.

*How would they even orchestrate that?*

I sat there for a long time, repeatedly flipping the switch on and off as if the repetition of this would bring more clarity. I stood there flipping that switch on and off like I was a geriatric old man smacking a television set, hoping for a signal.

The traffic jam cleared out and the streets became empty. I sat there, still as I could be, periodically flipping the switch on and off. The light synced every single time.¬†

Clearly this light switch - for some reason - was wired to that room in the building across the street. As to why, I had no earthly idea.

*What an expensive project, and for what? What purpose does it serve?*

I flipped the switch up and the light came back on. That last flip of the switch activated a - sorry - lightbulb moment within me.¬†

*What if I found a way into that room?*¬†

So I waited in the bitter cold, rehearsing my moves. I had counted up from the ground and determined the room which connected to my light switch was on the 31st floor and again it was the corner unit on the right side of the building when viewing from my apartment.

I waited for someone to go in or out of the building. Finally, I saw a woman with a giant coat drag her scrappy little dog towards the door. I was hesitant to actually go inside, but then I gathered some courage, walked right up to that door and casually slid through as she opened it. I had planned some elaborate cover story that my friend wouldn‚Äôt answer his phone and all that, but when it came time, I just acted natural and thanked her as I entered.

The halls were green and sickly looking, much like my apartment building. The elevator was questionable at best and creaked a little too much as I stepped into it. There were 33 floors so I was glad I had made note of the correct one. I slowly reached up and hit the circular button for the 31st floor and it flickered on, glowing with a jaundiced yellow.

My hands grew clammy as the elevator ascended at a torturously slow pace. I watched the numbers rise‚Ä¶

11‚Ä¶ 12‚Ä¶ 13‚Ä¶

*This is a stupid idea, man.*

*This is all in my head.*

*Why am I doing this?*

26‚Ä¶ 27‚Ä¶ 28‚Ä¶

*Is this even legal?*

*What am I going to do, exactly?*

The elevator finally dinged and bounced to a stop on the 31st floor before I had an actual plan. The doors were reluctant to open, and for a moment, my heart sank thinking I had been trapped in there.¬†

Those silver doors creaked and warped as they moved out of the way and exposed me to another green hallway. I stepped out and turned left. I could see all the way down the long dilapidated hall, the green lights humming and buzzing. My alleged culprit was the final door on the right.

It was room 3118. I sat outside the door like a maniac, just looking at it. I wondered what to do. I could barely see through the slits on the sides of the door, all I could make out was that the lights were on in there.¬†

*Do I knock?*

I looked around me and made sure the coast was clear.

*What the hell do I say? Maybe I‚Äôm lost? Maybe it‚Äôs an honest mistake? If anyone lives in there, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre very confused about their lights turning on and off. But why wouldn‚Äôt they take control of their own lights? Maybe they can‚Äôt use them - but that doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Why would I be able to control their lights but they ca-*

I knocked on the door and startled myself. It felt almost automatic.

Unsure of what to do, I started to shuffle away and make my retreat. Then I decided to stay and wait. I waited for a few seconds. The pause was long and uncomfortable enough for my hand to instinctually rise for another round of knocking.¬†

A faint and vague sound, dampened enough to even be of my own mind. But it was the sound of dragging, or a thud of some kind with something rolling afterward.

*What was that?*

The sound might‚Äôve continued, or my mind might‚Äôve kept wandering.

*Maybe the neighbors?*

The walls were thin in this place. I could begin to hear indiscernible conversation somewhere down the hall. I could hear the hissing chatter of a TV show somewhere else.

Underneath all that though, in room 3118 - a rolling sound still. Maybe?

*What is that noise?*

I left not long after. I was getting freaked out and I‚Äôm sure I would‚Äôve freaked out anyone living there.

When I got back to my place across the street, I felt very paranoid. I felt like I was being watched. I opened the squeaky door to my apartment and the long dark hallway of nine closed doors now made me nauseous with dread. I wanted to leave that apartment behind and run back into my mom‚Äôs arms or something - I felt like a child.¬†

I walked in, though. And I wish I hadn‚Äôt.

I took a scorching hot shower. It made me feel a little better, but I was still so paranoid. I kept hearing, or thought I was hearing, similar thudding and rolling sounds in one of the other rooms.

*Old pipes, that‚Äôs all.*

It took some more courage to leave the bathroom and enter the cold dark hall. I didn‚Äôt know what door to go through next - the kitchen door, bedroom door, or the extra door. My stomach was in a knot but I thought I should probably try and eat something.

It was around midnight by that point and I felt hopeless knowing there were so many more hours of dark left. I looked down at my half eaten peanut butter sandwich and knew this knot in my stomach wouldn‚Äôt go away if I didn‚Äôt have some kind of closure. I wanted to go into the extra room and turn off that switch for the night.

I braved the silent hallway again and opened up the ninth door into that grand room that turned the faintest sound into a booming echo. I walked up to the big window I always looked out of and, with great caution, looked up at room 3118.¬†

The light was still on - and there was something up there now.

I couldn‚Äôt tell what it was, but it looked like a big shadow. It wasn‚Äôt a person, but something boxy looking. Something square or just rigid, really.

*Furniture?*

*Did someone move something around in there?*

I didn‚Äôt know what I was looking at, and I honestly didn‚Äôt have the mental space to think about it much longer. I flipped off the light.

I flipped it back on.

I couldn‚Äôt deny my interest. I was very invested in this whole ordeal now.

The rigid thing started moving, at least I thought it looked like it was slowly changing position. It moved very smoothly and very, very slow. It looked like it was rolling or sliding.

It rolled from the right side of the window to the left. I flipped the switch here and there to see if it made any sort of difference. It didn‚Äôt seem to.

I watched it roll along for a few minutes from right to left until I jumped at the sight of the neighboring window‚Äôs light turning on. It was whoever lived in room 3116. I saw a person moving around in there and it looked like a more elderly man. He looked like he was listening closely to something, as if there were an intruder in his house.

I didn‚Äôt know what to do, but now I felt intrusive watching this man fumble around. I decided to switch the light off in 3118 and try to forget about the whole thing. I wanted to remove myself from this weird nightmare entirely. I decided that the next day I‚Äôd try to disconnect the switch and install some curtains. Find a new hobby. That all sounded like something rooted in everyday monotony and I let the comfort of curtain shopping lull me to sleep.

In my sleep that night, I heard the sound of aggressive wind chimes far away. They weren‚Äôt very melodic wind chimes, sort of just one tone that reverberated. Then I heard an awful banging sound. It was loud and most definitely not a dream. It sounded distant but it contained a lot of power. It was 3:48AM.

I tossed and I turned some until my bedroom started flashing red. I got out of bed and tried to see what was happening outside from my bedroom window but I couldn‚Äôt see through all the gloom trapped in between the glass. I had no choice but to go into the extra room if I wanted to see outside.

There was a large fire truck that was blocking off one side of the road and police were putting up caution tape on the other. Squad cars were rolling in one after the other. A few ambulances were present too but it seemed like no one was in a big rush. They were all circled around, their hands waving about in a casual, conversational way. At some point, one of them looked up and pointed and the others followed along. I followed the trajectory of the gestures all the way to the 31st floor. Room 3116 was now missing its pane of glass.

The curtains whipped out into the open world. The lights were still on and I could make out vague details of the interior.

Back on the ground, a few paramedics moved out of the way long enough for me to see what I was already preparing to see. The old man from room 3116 was laying there in a confusing mess of fabric, flesh, and bones surrounded by a growing puddle of blood. I was shocked.

*What the hell is going on?*

*What did I do?*

*Am I losing my mind?*

*Did I inadvertently kill that man?*

The next few days were a blur. My head was heavy with the endless hum of a thousand different thoughts all saying similar things. I felt an immense weight of guilt even though there was nothing tangible that connected me to the old man‚Äôs plunge. In my head, there was an ever growing web of continuity.

I uncovered the old switch, I flipped it incessantly and - in doing that - I created or resumed‚Ä¶ something. That something looked like a giant fucking rectangle that rolled around and made a man jump to his death. Or maybe it pushed him out by force?

*But‚Ä¶ why?*

*None of this makes any sense.*

*Maybe it‚Äôs all just make believe. I could‚Äôve misunderstood what I saw - the rolling rectangle thing - maybe it was just an illusion. That old man, maybe it‚Äôs just a coincidence he chose tonight to leap.*

*I know what I saw‚Ä¶*

I no longer was going into the extra room for any reason. The thought of that big empty space with that damn switch made me nauseous. I couldn‚Äôt stand sleeping just a few doors away from it. I wanted to move out and get away. I should‚Äôve done that. Reality doesn‚Äôt make room for fiction, though. I couldn‚Äôt and still can‚Äôt afford to break my lease, not by a long shot. That‚Äôs three rent payments and a bundle of paperwork in this godforsaken building. The apartment‚Äôs obviously outdated so I thought about making a case for lead paint or something toxic that could maybe get me out of here for free and quick but I‚Äôm not sure how that‚Äôd blow over. I don‚Äôt even know how to go about doing something like that.

I chose the route of avoidance. If I could ignore the extra room, the mystery switch, the dead man‚Äôs browning blood stain on the road, and the rolling rectangle monster whose whereabouts weren‚Äôt known - maybe it‚Äôd all just fade away with time.¬†

A few weeks went by and that strategy was seeming to work. Even in that short time, I was afforded some hindsight of the whole event - how I was jumping to conclusions, being paranoid, and maybe not appreciating my deteriorating vision that was probably making some serious guesswork.¬†

Still, there was no explaining away the light switch. That switch is undoubtedly connected to room 3118 across the street for some unknown reason. I must‚Äôve tested it hundreds of times. I tried to not let that fact dig too deep when I couldn‚Äôt sleep or when I‚Äôd think I heard the rolling sounds across the apartment late at night.

Eventually, I had saved up enough money to treat myself with some more furniture. I wanted to reclaim the extra room and make it mine. I started with a thrifted recliner and some shelves. I was planning on making it a home theater after all. I had plans to bury the big casement windows behind blackout curtains.

Earlier tonight, I was moving some new finds into the home theater. The room‚Äôs echo was just as booming and awful as when it was empty and I flinched with every screech and scrape the furniture would make when I moved it. As I heaved the new TV stand around, my eyes subconsciously checked on room 3118 - a reflex that must‚Äôve been built into me after all those cold nights. The lights were off as I had left them the last time I flipped the switch.

The lights were on in room 3116.

*Don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt freak out.*¬†

*Maybe someone new moved in.*

I watched longer than I should‚Äôve. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm so nosey. Always trying to get to the bottom of everything.

I watched and waited for any sign of movement in room 3116. I never saw a soul in there.

At some point, the big coat lady came out of the building with her dog and, for some stupid reason, I felt compelled to go talk to her.

*I just need to be sure of something.*

I walked casually down the sidewalk, waiting to ‚Äúrun‚Äù into her again. I was going to ask her if she had a lighter and then I was going to ask her if she had any information on room 3116.

Eventually, she reappeared around the corner with her feisty little dog walking on its hind legs, strangling itself with the leash.

I was leaned up on the wall next to the door I had snuck in weeks before, waiting to say my line.

‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDo you have a light?‚Äù

She looked up with confusion.¬†

‚ÄúLike a flashlight?‚Äù she asked.

I flashed my carton of cigarettes.

‚ÄúOh, no honey - I‚Äôve got asthma, sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo problem,‚Äù I muttered back.

I tried to come up with anything else I could say so I could eventually segue into room 3116. Blanking, I simply stared ahead in disappointment. That‚Äôs when I noticed the faded bloodstain on the sidewalk from the old man. I clicked my tongue.

‚ÄúTerrible what happened,‚Äù I muttered.¬†

The big coat lady turned around and saw what I was staring at, understanding immediately.

‚ÄúUgh, I know. I‚Äôm up on the 13th floor and I heard the uh - the sound.‚Äù She was slowly nodding and now staring at the old puddle of blood herself.

‚ÄúI heard someone talking about how they already moved a new family into that unit he was in, is that right?‚Äù I asked, surprising myself.

‚ÄúOh, no. I think they‚Äôre letting it sit like they did with the last one,‚Äù she said.¬†

My brow raised. I tried to not act like an insane person and scare her off.¬†

‚ÄúThe last one?‚Äù I asked hesitantly.

‚ÄúYeah, it was just a few months ago - or maybe it was a year now - but the young couple that lived right next door to him jumped out the window too,‚Äù she said in a flat way.

I could‚Äôve fainted. I felt dizzy and clammy, but I tried to keep my calm demeanor.

‚ÄúThat is, wow, I‚Äôm pretty new to the building so I hadn‚Äôt heard,‚Äù I stammered. I resigned from my niceties and my eyes went out of focus as my mind began jumping to its newest conclusion.

Somewhere in my peripheral, I noticed the lady nodding and looking down at her scraggly dog.

‚ÄúWell, it sure is hard out here these days,‚Äù she said, breaking the silence.

She shuffled through the heavy apartment door which slammed behind her, startling me. Torn from my trance, I quickly retreated back to my apartment.

*Shit‚Ä¶ shit!*

*What does this mean? That it - that rolling square thing - lives in that room and‚Ä¶ what? Kills people in it and around it? Do the people kill themselves? Does the thing maybe inject them with something that makes them, I don‚Äôt know, suicidal? Or maybe they go crazy and just jump?*

I was thinking like a fucking lunatic. Like one of the cracked out vagrants wandering through the abandoned motels back in my hometown. I tried to slow myself down, but now I‚Äôd been given perfect evidence to suit my paranoid suspicions. At first, I was just trying to solve this complex series of events, then I remembered I was involved. I remembered the switch plays a role in this whole thing. The light switch in my home theater.

*How far can it move?*

*How far‚Ä¶*

*Could it cross the street and climb the stairs and break in?*

*Maybe it‚Äôs quiet or maybe it has some kind of way to silently open my door so I don‚Äôt notice. So the neighbors don‚Äôt notice‚Ä¶*

I found myself back in the home theater with some cheap whiskey in a plastic bottle. I sipped on it and enjoyed the aromatic sting that made me slowly feel braver with every gulp. I looked up at the 31st floor across the street. The lights were still on in room 3116.

*They‚Äôre probably just cleaning it out. You need to calm yourself.*

*None of this is your problem.*

I felt better and braver still with every new swig of the cruel whiskey. At some point, I hovered my hand over the light switch. The dwindling sobriety in me said no. The courageous drunken me said¬†*I‚Äôm just curious*. My sight was beginning to sharpen and blur and I could tell I was swaying as I stood in front of those windows. I was drunk enough to where I felt like an observer of a faded memory from the past. I was drunk enough to where any action felt insignificant and all would be fine because nothing mattered.¬†

I flipped the switch, expecting the lights of room 3118 to blink on. The lights in room 3116 turned off instead.

*Shit!*

I don‚Äôt know why, but seeing those lights turn off made me duck and hide below the window. I felt like I woke the rolling thing up and now it could see me.

*Shit!*

*It moved. It fucking moved.*

Logic and reasoning was now out the window. The lights magically switched rooms and I can only imagine it‚Äôs because the square rolling thing now occupied - or will now materialize - inside of room 3116.

I continued hiding and thinking horrible thoughts to myself. I then did something I would‚Äôve never done had I not been wasted. I grabbed a hammer and smashed that fucking light switch. I smashed it into a million pieces and then smashed those pieces into dust. I‚Äôm sure my neighbors were fuming but I had been quiet as a church mouse up until tonight.

Both room 3118 and 3116 now had no lights on and I had made the drunken assumption that now they were both safe. This all began when I turned the lights on in 3118. Now the lights would stay off forever and I made sure of it. Clearly I didn‚Äôt have the self control to stop myself from tinkering with this unknown thing. I doubt anyone else who would live here would have much more discipline. So I smashed the fucking switch into a million pieces.

It wasn‚Äôt long before I blacked out.

Something woke me up hours later. It was deep into the night. I was still in the home theater and still drunk but now also hungover. I tried to pull it together enough to figure out what woke me.

I had thought it was a loud sound, but maybe it wasn‚Äôt. The air felt like something loud had just occurred, but that was just a feeling - maybe one of paranoia. I looked out the window and half-expected to see another person or persons lying smashed on the ground after diving off the 31st floor, but I saw no such horror. Both 3118 and 3116‚Äôs lights were still off.

I rubbed my eyes and looked around the pitch black room. I felt my blood freeze.

There was a light on in my apartment. I could see the thin sliver of yellow illuminating underneath the door of the home theater.

*It‚Äôs in.*

I wanted to run at first, but then I wanted to sit still and just listen. So I sat there, waiting for something. Maybe it was waiting for me to make a move.

Then I heard it. Muffled, maybe in the kitchen - rolling. Finally, I could hear the sound in finer detail. The wheels sounded heavy, like the sound of a stone tomb opening. The cheap hardwood floor buckled and cracked underneath those giant rolling wheels which must‚Äôve moved extremely slow and calculated - as if it was listening for my heartbeat.

I was frozen with fear and confused, so confused.

*What kind of nightmare has my life become?*

I wanted to try and make a break for it. I thought about running as fast as I could down my awful hallway and ripping that front door open. It was only a few quick strides away. I sat up a little too quickly, adrenaline was kicking in. A spring in the shitty secondhand recliner I had passed out on popped causing an insignificant yet audible click throughout the house.

Rolling followed. It was very slow, so slow that one‚Äôs ear could lose the deep droning tone after long enough to background noise.

I slowly sat back and the recliner crinkled ever so softly. The thing made a noise so intentionally imperceptible I could hardly make it out. A metallic sliding sound. The sound of a door‚Äôs latch being methodically opened. It was leaving the kitchen and maybe it was moving onto one of the other doors now.¬†

The yellow sliver of light went out and the apartment was now totally dark.

Rolling persisted and I was barely able to perceive the noise. I spent the next few minutes sliding off my recliner with the precision of prey which I undoubtedly had become. Thirty minutes could‚Äôve passed before I had crawled close enough to see under the door‚Äôs crack.

I carefully positioned my left eye to where I could see out into the black hallway just enough.

Something impossibly dark. Darker than the natural blackness of night. It was just sitting in the hall - waiting. It was large and boxy, just like that silhouette in 3118. It looked to almost perfectly fit the dimensions of the hall, leaving me sealed in.

*I‚Äôm dead.*

*Maybe not. Maybe I can call the police or something and distract it.*

*It‚Äôd kill them, though. Right? Then I‚Äôd be a murderer, maybe? Or maybe it would roll away. Maybe it isn‚Äôt bulletproof.*¬†

*I can‚Äôt have anyone else‚Äôs blood on my hands.*

*Maybe I can start a fire somehow and then the fire department will be able to rescue me from the window? Maybe that‚Äôs the stupidest thought I‚Äôve ever had.*

*Too much noise. I can‚Äôt make any noise. I can‚Äôt make a sound or it‚Äôll come get me.*

My thoughts were so frantic and visceral I feared even they would make a sound which could be intercepted by the masterful listener sitting mere feet away.

Another thirty minutes of eternity and I had silently made my way towards the large windows. I was so cautious and so deliberate in my movements as to not touch the tiniest plastic shard on the ground from when I had drunkenly destroyed the light switch.

*Maybe I made it angry by doing that. Maybe, in breaking the switch, the thing reverted back to me? Or maybe I exposed myself to it when I smashed that switch.*

I tried to use my phone and call for help, text for help, fucking email for help. None of it was going through. That damn rolling demon must‚Äôve jammed my signal somehow. I ran out of hope. I froze in place. Eventually, I just started to write all of this.¬†

I‚Äôm still in the home theater, typing all of this out on my phone as quietly as I can, even sipping the last of my whiskey with the most delicate swigs one could imagine.

This whole thing is rather bleak, and I apologize if you stumble across this. I‚Äôve scheduled this post to go up in eight hours, maybe by then the thing will have left and my final words will get out into the world to be forgotten or laughed at. I‚Äôm sure you think I‚Äôm insane or maybe I‚Äôm just a liar - and that‚Äôs okay - I know what happened here tonight. I don‚Äôt know how or why any of this happened, but I know the rolling thing outside my door is real.¬†

I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs here, what its motivation is, if it‚Äôs manmade or some impersonation of something we‚Äôd engineer or maybe it‚Äôs the very muse of humanity‚Äôs chase for right angles and industrial design. I now understand how those people in room 3118 and 3116 met their fate on the cracked pavement below. I think it wants me to kill myself. Either that or it‚Äôs totally content with me killing myself. It‚Äôs had me trapped in this room for hours now. It could‚Äôve barged in and flattened me at any point, but it hasn‚Äôt yet. Funny how this all started in this damn extra room of mine. Funny how these windows are the ideal design and size for me to throw myself from this hellish place.¬†

I don‚Äôt know anymore. At t this point I‚Äôm just trying to buy time and sip more whiskey before the inevitable. I had been distracted in writing this for a few hours and and even began to have hope that when the sun came up, the thing would roll away. All I‚Äôd need is a few minutes to get out.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm so lucky though. The sky is beginning to brighten into a deep blue and onc again I hear that steadDy rolling. so slow and meticulous, itt must only be moving a centimeter every fifteen minutes.

The whisky is is doing job and it‚Äôs becoming hard to type, harder to maintain literacy. I thikn I;ll wrap this up here. I‚Äôm sorry eveyone. I can only hope this is seen and if you did see this i thank you for keeping me company, in a Way. the suns almost up. I hear rolling and its close. The view from the window is very nice. Its looking like a nice day. I hope it iis a nice day,",1,1755609366.0,mothuncle,0,1.0,False

One of these people is the department leader/boss Morten. Now Morten is what you might describe as a regular c\*nt. He does everything he can to make our lives a living h\*ll at work, and generally just prevent any happiness in our lives. Just a regular pr\*ck who enjoys causing misery to everybody around himself. We all know a person like that. Morten also happens to be a manchester city fan(I know, worse). He is what you might describe as a new fan after the club was purchased by a middle-eastern billionaire. So even though he is a plastic fan, he still goes over the top insane when watching games and talk trash about man united, liverpool, arsenal, chelsea(yup, one of those types).  
  
Anyway we have way too many rules at work that restrict us, however, innocent pranks are allowed, and anything to piss off the boss is a well spend penny/krone.

So the idea is that we buy 10 manchester united shirts with names on the back of current man city players(just to annoy him even more). Our office room is like a long hall with 10 walls, where we can place something up the wall. The walls are right now empty, so we are thinking we can place a united shirt at each one of them. Morten is also known for getting coffee all the time and going to the bathroom like 20 times over a single work day. The kitchen/bathroom is downstairs, so he would have to walk past all 10 manchester united shirts, and this will definitely piss him off. The idea that we can cause as much pain to the boss as he does to us, is usually a fantasy for most of us working families, but in this instance, it can be a reality, with the help from anyone who understand this feeling and support this wonderful and innocent cause.

Even though I would sit down to work, my mind would not cooperate. Conversations were boring, simple activities took an eternity, and no matter how much I slept, I always woke up fatigued.

I put the blame on laziness, stress, and a lack of drive. In actuality, though, my brain wasn't damaged; it was simply not receiving the necessary information.

What Actually Helped. Before concentrating on addressing the underlying problems rather than pursuing band-aid solutions, I tried everything‚Äîsupplements, nootropics, even eliminating caffeine‚Äîbut nothing helped. This is what genuinely changed things:

1 Hydration & Blood Sugar Control

Drinking more water and balancing my meals stopped the energy crashes that made me foggy by midday. Instead of skipping meals or snacking on carbs, I started my mornings with protein + healthy fats, and within days, my focus improved.

2 Sunlight & Movement

I forced myself to get morning sunlight + a 5-minute walk before working. It seemed too simple to work, but within a week, I stopped feeling like I needed coffee just to function.

3 Deep Sleep Fixes

I thought I was sleeping enough, but I was waking up groggy. Adding magnesium + cutting screens an hour before bed made a huge difference. I started waking up feeling rested instead of sluggish.

4 Brain Nutrients I Was Missing

It turned out I was low on B12 and Omega-3s, which are essential for focus and mental clarity. After adding them to my diet, I noticed my thoughts felt sharper, and the mental fog finally started lifting. Other supps which I take are ksm 66, l theanine and moda sometimes from sportsresearch, ndepot and highstreetpharma.

The Turning Point

The biggest lesson? Brain fog isn‚Äôt random its a sign that something is off. Once I stopped treating it like an unsolvable mystery and started giving my body what it needed, everything changed.

If you‚Äôre feeling stuck in a fog, start with the basics water, real food, movement, sleep. Small changes make a bigger impact than you‚Äôd think.",12,1755608728.0,Biohackers,3,0.93,False

I didn't have any direction interaction with the intern initially but she worked on a project I was working on and I helped her as any senior would do. 
One day we went to team outing and she was sitting just in front of me along with other team mates. The team outing was huge like 20 people so there were subgroups talking about random things. Our group is occasional drinker but we didn't order drinks but one of team member ordered a cocktail and intern ordered same version of mocktail. We realised it later on after intern had it half but then to support her we also ordered some drinks. It was a classic team outing and out of my nature I was adding jokes b/w conversations. That was about it and we asked waiter to not serve drink to her because we knew she was light.
Nothing suspectible but intern started having breakfasts with me and me also new to team have asked too many questions about her life, college etc. She will ask questions about my life and she already knew that I am getting married in couple of months so she forced me to see my fiancee pictures. One day she will ask me where do I live and with whom and when I told her that I live with my fiancee she took it as a joke.
When we went for the coffee in the office together (in office coffee place), she will always make long eye contacts and will throw a good smile at me and will always shy and also it felt like she is trying to start good interesting conversations.
On one of the team outings, she shared her personal number even when some other team member asked me to call him and was very happy when I saved her number. On the last day, she became very upset when I was not in her farewell meeting. 
Am I thinking too much? Generally I forget about this as normal office chit chat but it is happening second time. In last company, similar things happened and when girl got to know that I am getting married she was very shocked. Although everyone I talk to knows that I am in a long term relationship.

1muhuuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleanSweepers/comments/1muhuuj/reveal_the_truth_about_carbona_carpet_cleaner/,Reveal the Truth About Carbona Carpet Cleaner with Brush,"Using the Carbona 232FBA1 carpet cleaner felt like a necessary addition to my housecleaning arsenal. Between a rambunctious toddler, a dog with no respect for rugs, and my own clumsiness when it comes to coffee, this product has been put through rigorous tests. The name promises oxy-powered foam and two-in-one stain removal capabilities, so I dove right into the challenge of assessing whether this cleaner could battle the chaos my household generates.

**Design and Packaging**  
The first thing I noticed about this product was its compact yet sturdy design. The bottle has a clean, ergonomic shape that‚Äôs easy to hold even with wet hands‚Äîa detail that seems small until you‚Äôre halfway through scrubbing. The dual-action applicator, featuring a sponge and bristles, is both tactile and functional. The sponge is large enough for covering surface stains, while the bristles are surprisingly firm, perfect for working deep into carpet fibers. However, I did find the cap felt a bit flimsy. It snaps back into place but doesn‚Äôt inspire the confidence that it would survive an accidental drop. 

**Ease of Use**  
What makes this cleaner stand out is how intuitive it is to use. You simply flip it open, squeeze to release the cleaning solution, and start scrubbing. With the dual-action applicator, I could tackle both surface stains and deeper messes seamlessly. Whether it was a splash of fruit juice or a mysterious, dog-related disaster (trust me, I didn‚Äôt want to investigate), the product easily penetrated the mess. I appreciated the clear instructions on testing it on an inconspicuous area first. While this extra step might feel tedious, it‚Äôs a common-sense precaution many might overlook, especially when trying to salvage light-colored, high-pile rugs.

[Check Carbona 232FBA1 price on Amazon.](https://app.womanreview.com/p/b0cz2jpsqk/)

**Strengths**  
- The oxy-powered formula genuinely works. Within minutes, even deep-set stains start to fade, and the foam gives a satisfying visual cue of ‚Äúcleaning in progress.‚Äù  
- The targeted bristle design ensures reactive power, reaching into fibers that a flat sponge would miss.
- It‚Äôs pet and kid-friendly, which gives peace of mind after cleanup.  
- Compact size makes it convenient to store without crowding cleaning supplies.

**Performance and Results**  
The promise of oxy-powered technology initially felt like marketing jargon, but it impressed me in action. I tested it on a few different types of stains, like a two-day-old coffee spill, and even attempted to revive a rug marred by spilled marinara sauce from last week. The cleaner lifted these stains far better than I expected. There was, however, a faint residue left that required an additional pass with a damp cloth to completely remove. While my carpets appeared visibly brighter and smelled fresher, truly old stains might take repeated applications.

**Disadvantages**  
- The brush can sometimes be too abrasive for thinner carpets or delicate upholstery, so exercise caution depending on the material.
- For extremely old or set-in stains, the cleaner only reduces their visibility rather than obliterating them entirely.
- Residue removal might take an extra step for perfectionists like me who can‚Äôt stand even the faintest cleaner streaks.

**Alternative Offerings**  
In a competitive market filled with carpet cleaning sprays, the Carbona 232FBA1 outdoes multipurpose cleaners but is rivaled by products like Resolve or BISSELL solutions. Resolve has an edge on price accessibility, while BISSELL‚Äôs machine-compatible sprays might prove superior for regular high-traffic homes. That said, Carbona‚Äôs pinpoint applicator and dual-function brush feel unmatched for precision and portability. While large house cleaners dominate with volume, this product fits niche needs perfectly‚Äîspot-cleaning and small stains.

**Smart Spending**  
Considering its features, Carbona delivers solid value without the commitment of heavyweight cleaning gadgets. While the volume is modest, you‚Äôre paying for effectiveness over quantity. It‚Äôs an excellent in-between option that doesn‚Äôt ask for the budget of industrial cleaners, and the results justify what it offers.

But I‚Äôm upset and angry, and I‚Äôm aware I have a temper, so I‚Äôm trying to preplan my moves so I don‚Äôt firebomb my relationship with my Mum.

It‚Äôs a somewhat complex background, I‚Äôll put a summary at the end.
I‚Äôm Anglo-Indian, Mum is the Anglo half.
Dad died suddenly very young, almost 25yrs ago.
I‚Äôve always been much closer to his side of the family, and even though before he died I was your classic ‚Äúteenager embarrassed of her Dad‚Äù, he truly was my favourite parent.
Now? Even Mum half-jokes that my Uncle (Dad‚Äôs older brother) is my favourite parent.

I mean, he taught me to drive, babysat my brother and I, buys my fruit and veg, calls me regularly, introduced me to rock and roll, the list goes on.
He is disabled, never married or had kids, so even before Dad died, he was always the 3rd parent, coming with Dad, brother and I to sports games etc.
I‚Äôm trying not to provide TOO much background, but there‚Äôs so much context!

Now the reason I mentioned my Uncle, is because he is requiring more help, and my grandma is nearly blind (lives with him), so I go over every Friday to help out.
I got upset earlier this year because mum promised she‚Äôd help me a bit with them, she‚Äôs now decided ‚Äúthey‚Äôre not my family, they‚Äôre my in-laws‚Äù despite the fact we ALL know in Indian families, family=family. They adore her and did so much for her and us, not just school fees and babysitting.
I said ‚ÄúSo what, because I‚Äôm old enough now, your in-laws aren‚Äôt your problem anymore, I have to take care of them?‚Äù And she said yes.
I resent her for it.

I try to involve her in my life, asking her out for coffee, go to the plant nursery, I have to beg for her interaction, she‚Äôd rather play computer games or chain smoke and scroll on her phone. Yet when she sees I go on outings with grandma, she sounds jealous.

Mum is clearly tired, retired and ‚Äúover‚Äù parenting, brother and I are in our late 30s.
My brother and I are both neurodivergent, but she doesn‚Äôt see me to be ‚Äúas serious‚Äù as his, and treats him differently (preferential) either because he‚Äôs a boy or ‚Äúmore neurodivergent‚Äù or both.
Eg she still does his washing and other tasks he‚Äôs more than capable of, infantilises him then wonders why he can‚Äôt cope with minor inconvenience or stress.

TL/DR;
 I moved out almost 3yrs ago and I‚Äôm the one that always has to make the effort: I call her, text her, she might only do that once or twice a month. She‚Äôs visited once in those 3yrs aside from move-in day.
She‚Äôll drive interstate for a holiday, but won‚Äôt make the 20min drive to visit me.

I always have to go over there, heck even my brother visits me and he gets nervous driving on the highway.

I‚Äôm looking for someone who enjoys great conversation and going out for meals, to places like cafes, restaurants, and lounges. I don‚Äôt drink and much prefer quieter environments. I identify as asexual (or somewhere on that spectrum), so I‚Äôm more focused on emotional and romantic connection than anything physical. If you‚Äôre the same‚Äîor just value deep connection‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to chat.

I‚Äôm blind and use a screen reader and Bluetooth keyboard to read and write, but that‚Äôs just one part of who I am. I‚Äôve never let it stop me from living fully. If we meet in person, I‚Äôd appreciate someone who might gently guide me to where their voice is coming from‚Äîlike at a coffee shop or dinner‚Äîjust to make the experience smoother and more fun.

I‚Äôm open to chatting with people from anywhere and seeing how things develop. If this resonates with you, feel free to message me! 
PS. If anyone previously reahced out to me when i posted on here, feel free to reach out again as I have unfortunately lost some chats. The guy from a small rural town in Missouri for example with the subject line, just reaching out. I can sadly no longer find that conversation. ",2,1755607900.0,gayfriendship,0,0.75,False

So, here‚Äôs the deal, I‚Äôve been out of the game for a while. Life took a few unexpected turns, and I became a single dad. It‚Äôs been a wild, rewarding ride focusing on raising my little man, but now that the dust has settled a bit, I‚Äôm realizing I miss adult conversations, laughs, and yeah, maybe a bit of flirtatious fun too.

About me:

* 30 years old, down to earth and sarcastic by default, with a soft spot for dad jokes (sorry in advance).
* My hobbies include stepping on LEGO in the dark, trying to cook like I‚Äôm on a cooking show, and pretending I understand how the school app works.
* I‚Äôm emotionally available, baggage-claimed, and just looking to connect. Whether it‚Äôs a witty exchange, flirty chats, or something that grows into more.

About you:

* Someone who‚Äôs open-minded, good-humoured, and doesn‚Äôt mind a guy who occasionally has to pause a conversation because of bedtime chaos.
* Bonus points if you're into cosy nights, coffee-fuelled mornings, or can recommend a good show to binge when the kiddo‚Äôs asleep.

Not looking to rush anything. Just good convos, mutual vibes, and maybe some playful banter to break the ice.

First off, a huge thank you to everyone who participated in the discussion on previous posts and polls! I truly appreciate everyone who took the time to share their perspectives, both the agreements and the criticisms. This kind of discussion really helps me understand what you find useful and what we can improve together. The community's voice is essential in shaping what r/CogniWiki becomes.

As a new moderator and a clinical psychologist, I'm committed to helping r/CogniWiki grow into a space for consistent, high-quality, and insightful discussion about mental health, neuroscience, nootropics and cognitive optimization.

To help make that happen, I‚Äôm excited to introduce a simple weekly content structure, starting this week (August 18-24). This can add a reliable rhythm of content that we can all look forward to and engage with.

**Here‚Äôs the plan moving forward:**

* **Mindful Monday:** A weekly post to start the week with a practical, actionable tip or concept. This might be a simple therapeutic skill, a mindset reframe, or a small challenge to bring more awareness to your week. A quick mental coffee for your Monday morning :)
* **Deep Dive Wednesday:** This will be our main educational post each week. We‚Äôll tackle the topics you care about, like how to get the most out of therapy, the psychology behind sustainable biohacking, or deep dives into specific conditions. These posts will be detailed, evidence-informed, and designed to spark thoughtful discussion.
* **Community Friday:** The week ends with a focus on us. This will be a more flexible space for open discussions, Q&As, sharing resources, and celebrating weekly wins. This is where your voices and experiences take center stage.

This is an experiment, and its success depends on you. Your participation, your questions, and your insights are what will make this come alive.

I encourage you to use the comments below to **let me know what you think of this structure**, and **suggest topics you‚Äôd love to see covered** in future **Deep Dive Wednesdays** or **Mindful Mondays**.

'A friend of mine had been in a play and I went backstage after the performance and Dave walked in.

'We got talking, then we all went to dinner and by the time we got to cigarettes and coffee, as you did in those days, we did the chair-swapping and I got chatting with him.

'We got on really well. He comes from the same part of the world as I do. I didn‚Äôt want anything from him, he didn‚Äôt want anything from me.‚Äô

At the time of their meeting in 1988, Bowie had long been a superstar; Oldman had earned a Bafta nomination for the critically acclaimed film about Joe Orton, Prick Up Your Ears, but had yet to cement his reputation as one of Britain‚Äôs finest actors.

‚ÄòDave said, ‚ÄúThis is where I‚Äôm staying, under this name, give me a call,‚Äù‚Äâ‚Äô says Oldman. ‚ÄòWhich I didn‚Äôt do!‚Äô He laughs.

‚ÄòBut then a couple of months later he called me. He was taking a break and doing some writing on Mustique, where he had a house at that time. He said, ‚ÄúCome over, I‚Äôve got a spare room.‚Äù My son Alfie was only five months old at that time, but we went. And it was fantastic. Dave is a really nice guy.

- Ubisoft (France) - https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/UBSFY/summary

- Embracer Group (Sweden) - https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/THQQF/summary

Their physical HQ location doesn‚Äôt matter a lot since both sell their games worldwide and have small development studios in many countries (the same goes for global distribution, most games are overwhelmingly sold in digital form anyway nowadays. Physical distribution became a niche).

Reasons:

Both companies over-invested in recent years (projects, headcount and/or M&A) and had to cut back and restructure, both stocks tumbled a lot since their all-time highs during the pandemic (2020-2022).

Both have interesting and deep IP rights in entertainment (eg. Embracer Group owns the rights to LotR/Tolkien‚Äôs works, beyond just games).

Both may be worth more in a sum-of-parts analysis:

Ubisoft shifted a part of their business (3 very popular IPs) into a JV with Tencent (China), that JV slice is worth more than all of Ubisoft:

https://www.theverge.com/news/637775/ubisoft-tencent-carveout-assassins-creed-far-cry-tom-clancy

Embracer did a spinoff earlier this year (Asmodee) and is further splitting up in late 2025, the market may not appreciate the full value of all their three businesses until the final spin-off is completed:

https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-intends-to-spin-off-coffee-stain-group-by-the-end-of-2025-with-remaining-business-rebranded-as-fellowship-entertainment

(Please note that Embracer will also change its corporate name in 2026, after the final spin-off).

Both Ubisoft at below 10 EUR and Embracer Group at below 85 SEK per share look interesting to me long-term.

Both enjoy very low market cap/enterprise value numbers compared to their peaks and their sector peers.

I know that the video game sector is hard to estimate in terms of future cash-flows because of its ‚Äúhit or miss‚Äùnature (much like movies, future box office returns) and frequent cost and deadline overruns. 

I however think that both companies have deep enough IP treasure chests to even out such hits and misses.

More generally, it‚Äòs much easier to sell older video games digitally nowadays (longer and steady back-catalogue income streams over many years) - compared to selling out of physical copies in the past.

What I'm looking for: Someone who's genuine, kind, and open-minded. I like a serious relationship and am ready to build a future together. I don't mind chatting online first and seeing how things go. If we're compatible, maybe we can have coffee or a nice meal together. The man in my life doesn't have to be fancy or wealthy. He just needs to be able to make a living, be there for me when I'm down, and cheer me up when I'm down. And most importantly, he needs to be honest and open-minded 

If you think we're a good match, send me a message and tell me a little about yourself! ",2,1755606712.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

The interview was originally supposed to be today at 12 pm. The interviewer kindly offered to reschedule, and I said I could do 3 pm tomorrow instead of 2pm today because I thought I‚Äôd be more prepared with extra time and rest.

Now I‚Äôm panicking. If I wait until tomorrow, I worry other candidates (who are interviewing today) might already fill the spot. But if I do it today, I‚Äôll be running on zero sleep and probably perform terribly.

To make things worse, tomorrow is also one day before I move, so it‚Äôs going to be chaotic no matter what.

Understanding the Foundations of Oral Health

A successful oral care routine is built on more than just brushing your teeth. It's a holistic approach that encompasses multiple aspects of dental hygiene and overall wellness. Research shows that proper oral care can prevent up to 90% of common dental problems, making it an essential part of your daily health regimen.

Key Components of an Effective Oral Care Routine

1. Brushing Techniques Matter

Proper brushing is the cornerstone of any effective oral care routine. **Use a soft-bristled toothbrush** and follow these critical guidelines:
- Brush for at least two minutes, twice daily
- Hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to the gums
- Use gentle, circular motions
- Replace your toothbrush every three to four months

Choosing the Right Toothpaste

Not all toothpastes are created equal. Look for options that:
- Contain fluoride
- Address specific dental concerns (sensitivity, whitening)
- Have ADA (American Dental Association) approval

The Importance of Flossing

Many people overlook flossing, but it's crucial for removing plaque and food particles between teeth. Dentists recommend:
- Flossing at least once daily
- Using proper technique to clean between each tooth
- Using interdental cleaners for wider spaces

Advanced Oral Care Strategies

Mouthwash and Oral Rinses

A quality mouthwash can provide additional protection:
- Kills bacteria
- Freshens breath
- Helps prevent plaque buildup

Professional Dental Care

Regular dental check-ups are non-negotiable:
- Visit your dentist every six months

- Address potential issues early

Special Considerations for Different Age Groups

Children's Oral Care
- Start dental hygiene early
- Use age-appropriate toothbrushes
- Teach proper brushing techniques

Adult Oral Care
- Focus on prevention
- Monitor changes in oral health
- Address specific concerns like sensitivity

Senior Oral Care

Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Brushing too hard
- Neglecting tongue cleaning
- Using old or worn-out toothbrushes
- Skipping regular dental check-ups

Holistic Approach to Oral Health

Remember that oral health connects to overall wellness. Stress, sleep, nutrition, and lifestyle all impact your dental health. A comprehensive approach considers these interconnected factors.

Conclusion

Creating an optimal oral care routine requires commitment, knowledge, and consistent practice. By implementing these strategies, you'll not only maintain a beautiful smile but also support your overall health.

1mugyzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1mugyzv/the_donut_that_never_left/,The Donut That Never Left,"Jelly-filled. Pink icing and rainbow sprinkles delicately blanketed the top of its exquisite, glistening mass. This delightfully devious little body made of sugar, fried dough, and strawberry-flavored goop tempted me to the point of no return. I pressed the tip of my index finger against the glass and said,

""This one.""

I knew I shouldn't have. But I'd been so good lately. I deserved a treat. And besides, I'd make up for it at the gym later, then pound a fuck-ton of water and flush that bitch right out. Yeah, it's no big deal. It's Friday: cheat day. And this week's been hell. I *needed* this.

""That'll be $1.99, sir.""

The lady at the counter smiled and handed me the bulging bag. I held it close, pressing its warm weight against my chest. My mouth pooled with saliva as I slid her my debit card. 

""Anything else?""

I glanced back toward the glass dome filled with plump pastries, then shook my head. They all looked like whores, slathered in chocolate and cheaply seductive‚Äîno substance. Nope, I had everything I needed right here in this greasy white paper bag. *Mine* had fruit. She handed my card back over and said, 

""Have a nice day!""

I grinned, looking down at the bag cradled in my arms. I sure as shit will, I thought. Then, I hurried back to my car to devour this goddess of a donut in seclusion. I needed privacy; this was a moment to be savored. Carefully, I eased my hand into the bag's opening until the tips of my fingers met her soft, pillowy posterior. Once I'd gripped onto the end, I gently pulled to reveal divine perfection. 

The icing lay undisturbed; every single sprinkle had held on. It didn't feel right to just go in at it. No, it was too beautiful to be ravaged like that. It begged to be adored and cherished‚Äîworshiped. I couldn't just bite into this donut like some sort of monster. The jelly would spill out all over, and I didn't have any napkins. 
 
I held it up to my face, admiring the flawless sheen of its glaze in the soft morning light. I inhaled deeply, slowly taking in the heavenly scent that filled me with euphoria. Then, I slid my tongue gently across the surface of its sweet, crispy skin. And that's where it all began. This simple little act of mindless self-indulgence would later become the single biggest regret of my life.

Yet, a smile crept across my face as the intense warmth of this magnificent exterior overwhelmed me. I had one thought, and one thought only: I needed to get to what was inside. Slowly, I sank my teeth deep into its sugary flesh, carefully removing the tiniest of morsels and releasing a floodgate of warm, red jelly. I let the intoxicating, chunky viscus pour into my mouth and surrendered to the ecstasy. 

After that, I blacked out.

When I came to, I'd devoured the whole thing. Not a trace of it remained; even my fingers had been licked clean and sucked dry. I searched the bag, hoping there might be a tiny smidge of icing left behind, but nothing. Not even a sprinkle. It was all gone. *Shit,* I don't even get to keep the memory of enjoying it? Why did I scarf it down so quickly? 

The only evidence that I'd even done so was the lump pressing hard at the back of my throat as the last bite of my breakfast made its way down my esophagus and onto the gullet. Guess I need to work on that whole *'self-control'* thing.

As I drove to work in my sugared-up intoxication, the lump began to squirm. Must be a burp trying to come out, I thought; probably swallowed a fuck ton of air during my binge-fit. I slammed my fist against my chest, but it didn't help. Instead, I could feel my throat tightening around the bulge, trying to push it down. No‚Äîthe opposite. It felt like that hunk of donut was forcing its way down, in spite of my body trying to stop it. What the fuck. 

My eyes watered as I began to cough, choking on the wad of dough that had now firmly planted itself just above my sternum. The bitch wasn't moving at all. I struggled to keep my eyes on the road as I frantically searched the floor of my passenger seat for a half-empty bottle of water. Finally, I laid my hand on one, leaned my head back, and chugged. 

Down she went, without a fight. I smiled and threw the empty bottle back down onto the floor where it belonged. Then, I took a deep breath of relief. *God,* how stupid would it have been if I'd choked to death on a fucking donut? Embarrassing. I wiped my eyes and continued down the road. 

By the time I got to work, the donut had reached my stomach, landing like a boulder dropped off a cliff. I ran to the bathroom, thinking I had to take a shit. I sat in that stall straining for at least 10 minutes, but nothing came out. So, I stood up and pulled my pants back on. Then, I turned around and looked at the toilet. I froze. There, floating in the water, was a single blue sprinkle.

My eyes widened, and I blinked a few times. Then, I leaned forward to make sure I was really seeing what I thought I was. Yep‚Äîa sprinkle. Not a poop-sized one. A regular one. My body snapped upright. No fucking way that came out of my butt. It had to have been on my pants. I just didn't notice. Yeah, of course, that's what it was.

I walked from the bathroom laughing at myself for getting freaked out, even momentarily. My stomach was still killing me, though. The damn donut was sloshing around in the water I'd chugged like a ship caught in a storm. With each step I took, I could feel it rocking back and forth. 

*Gurgle, gurgle. Slosh, slosh.*

When I got to my desk, I started searching around in all the drawers for a roll of Tums. I got excited for a second, until I realized it was just the empty wrapper I'd left myself to be fooled by later. Past me is such an asshole. 

*Gurrrrrp!*

""Shut up.""

Fuck. I had to do something, and quickly. My stomach was visibly rippling at that point, and I could barely stay seated. I thought about undoing my belt, but I didn't want to get accused of being a pervert. Especially not after I accidentally elbowed Sharon from accounting in the boob last week. That was her fault for crowding me at the coffee pot, though. Unfortunately, HR didn't see it that way.

Wait‚Äîcoffee! That'll make me shit, I thought. Even though my stomach was past maximum capacity, it seemed like my only option. Besides, a shot of black coffee to the gut might just actually do the trick to move this mass along. The bitch had already overstayed her welcome. It was time for an eviction notice. 

I hurried to the break room to find Sharon at the coffee pot. *Of course.* I kept my distance as we silently exchanged awkward glances. I didn't want to look her in the eye, so I stared at the coffee pot in her hands instead. I was so uncomfortable. I could barely keep still as my gurgles and groans echoed through the otherwise empty room. She cut her pour short, grabbed a handful of Sweet'N Low packets, then rushed out of the door while covering her nose. *Pftt*‚Äîprobably thought I was farting. Believe me, lady. I wish I *could* fart.

I poured a splash and a half into my cup and threw it back, still scalding. It burned all the way down, but I didn't care. The pain in my throat was a welcome distraction from the mayhem that was going on in my stomach. The roof of my mouth was going to be fucked for a day or two. But, I figured, if it worked, it would all be worth it. After all, this was my last-ditch effort to be able to make it through the rest of my workday. 

It also turned out to be a big mistake.

The searing black liquid landed with an eruption. I immediately doubled over in the worst pain I'd ever felt in my life. The wad of sugary dough had begun to thrash violently, slamming itself against the walls of my stomach. No, I'm not fucking joking. I could feel it. Not just in my stomach‚Äîwith my hands, too. I literally felt this donut pounding from the inside out, lifting my skin as it pushed against its gastric prison. 

I ran full speed to the bathroom, praying I'd make it there before I passed out, vomited, or shit my pants. Or, all three. My belly bounced as I ran, suddenly swollen like a puppy with worms. I thought I was bloated before, but now I was literally about to pop. The movement made the pain infinitely worse, but I had no choice. Fuck this. It had to come out.

The stall door slammed against the wall, and I fell to my knees, gripping the toilet in preparation. My face was ice-cold and clammy. Warm saliva flooded my mouth. Yes! Come out! Be gone, bitch! 

*GUUURRRPPP*

I began to heave and spit into the toilet. The mass was so close I could taste it, but nothing was coming out. It was fighting me. I shoved my finger down into my throat, scraping against the burnt roof of my mouth. I winced from the pain, and my eyes started watering uncontrollably. A few gags, and up she came. 

A putrid flurry of pink sludge spewed from my mouth, swirled with a deep, crimson red foam. It splattered back up into my face when it hit the toilet at lightning speed. Fuck, so much came out of me, I can't even explain it. But that was only phase one. Next came the chunks. 

By the time I was done, I thought I was going to lose consciousness. The room was spinning, and I struggled to catch my breath, so I lowered myself onto the floor, still hugging the toilet. 

I couldn't help but inspect this ungodly force that had just come out of me. Slowly, I lifted my head and peeked over the seat. *Holy fuck.* I gazed down at the thick pink vomit in utter shock and disgust. Shit, it looked like I'd barely even chewed this donut. Even the rainbow sprinkles had all remained whole, floating around in the sludge like tiny specks of whimsy in a cotton candy-colored massacre. Surrounding them were a few large globs of fleshy beige, accompanied by several smaller red clumps. *Christ.* I just *had* to get the one with fruit, huh?

Suddenly, my eyes fixed on the largest red chunk floating in the middle of the sludge. It looked different than the other ones. Shaped weird. And it was... *moving?* I wiped my eyes. Yes‚Äîit was fucking moving! Convulsing. Constricting. Sputtering red goop from both ends. *No fucking way.*

I stood up so fast, I nearly fell backwards out of the stall. Black spots began to appear in my line of vision. I gripped onto the threshold with both hands as I swayed, trying to regain balance. I held my breath and slowly leaned forward to look again. It stopped.

Oh, thank God. It *wasn't* moving. Get it together, bro. It's just a chunk of strawberry; how could it be moving? I almost wanted to poke at it, but considering how vile the mess I'd made in the toilet was, I resisted that urge.

The hinges of the bathroom door creaked, and footsteps began to approach. I quickly reached over and flushed the rainbow sprinkled slurry. It smelled like death‚Äîsickly sweet with a hint of berry. I desperately tried to fan the stink away with one hand while wiping my face with the other.

When I exited the stall, Jerry from sales was at the urinal. He turned to look at me as I approached the sink, visibly disgusted by the pungent odor that had completely filled the room at that point.  

""Gnarly case of food poisoning,"" I told him. 

He nodded, then focused his eyes back in front of him. With a splash of water and a squirt of soap, I quickly washed my hands and ran out of there. On the way back to my desk, I bumped into my boss, who promptly asked what the hell I'd been doing all morning. 

""Sorry, sir. I think I'm coming down with something.""

He folded his arms in front of him and scrunched his eyebrows. 

""That's the excuse you're going with this time?""

""Ask Jerry, he'll tell you. I was just in the bathroom. If you want proof, go in there and take a big whiff."" 

""Alright, that's enough,"" he said. ""Just make sure that report is on my desk before lunch, then you can leave if you need to. And don't forget, you're still on disciplinary probation after last week.""

""Yes, sir.""

Fuck. I forgot all about that damn report. I hadn't even started it yet, and it was almost 10:00. At least my stomach was starting to feel better. My abs were sore from all the heaving, but now that just meant I could skip the gym later. I'd already puked up the donut anyway, so the carbs didn't count. 

Shit, what a weird ass morning I was having‚Äîalmost got killed by a donut twice. What an evil bitch! She tempted me, then tortured me. Well, lesson learned. Not going back to that bakery again. At least now she was gone, and it was over. 

I sat down at my desk, opened up a Word document, and began typing nonsense. My thoughts were all jumbled up, and my head was throbbing from straining so hard. I kept having to retype each sentence over and over until it made sense. Before I knew it, another hour had gone by, and I was sweating. 

My hand reached up to wipe away the droplets accumulating on the ridge of my brow. Right away, I noticed something weird. My sweat was thick. Like... *goop.* I slowly pulled my hand away in confusion to look at the substance that had just excreted from my pores. 

It was clear, like sweat's supposed to be. But there was a ton of it. And it didn't drip. No‚Äîinstead, it gathered in a rounded clump at the edge of my fingertips. Then, I pressed my fingers together. It was sticky, too. *Oh, god.* I slowly raised my hand up to my lips and tasted. It was fucking *sugar.*

Okay... something weird is definitely going on. What the fuck was in that donut?! I had to leave work. Immediately. To hell with this damn report. I needed to go home and start googling. And also take a shower, because my face and hands were all sticky. Oh‚Äîand I still smelled like vomit, too. 

I got up and left everything on my desk as it was, including the open document of word salad on my computer screen. Hopefully, my boss would see all that and realize this was an emergency. If not, oh well, whatever. I'll just deal with it on Monday, I thought.

I raced home, taking a different route to avoid having to pass that bakery. I felt like just the sight of it might make me sick again. There had to be something wrong with that donut. I felt totally normal until I met that sugary bitch. Maybe it really was food poisoning. *Fuck*‚Äîthe strawberries! E. coli, duh. *Damn*, should've gotten one of the whores; chocolate would've never betrayed me like that.

Food poisoning didn't exactly explain the sugary sweat, but I was still convinced that's what it was. Maybe I got so sick, I'd started hallucinating? Yeah, that *had* to be it. Ha! That donut wasn't actually thrashing in my stomach. The strawberry chunk wasn't ever moving. And the goopy sweat? Probably just some leftover glaze I didn't realize was there. *Pftt.* I shook my head and chuckled to myself. There was nothing to worry about. It'll pass.

I got home, threw my keys onto the side table, and headed straight for the bathroom. I decided to brush my teeth first. My breath was so rank I couldn't stand it anymore, and the taste of sugar and stomach acid still lingered on my tongue. I brushed the hell out of my entire mouth for at least 2 1/2 minutes, then spit into the sink. When I saw what had come out of my mouth, I almost choked. 

Sprinkles. A bunch of them. God, how did they all get stuck in my teeth like that? How did I not feel them? I cupped my hand under the faucet and rinsed my mouth out a few times. Each time I spit, more came out. It seemed to be an endless supply of them, like there was a God damned sprinkle dispenser somewhere behind my molars. But finally, after the fifth rinse, I ran my tongue across my teeth and didn't feel any more. So, I got into the shower and figured if anything else weird happened, I'd just worry about it then.

Then, something else weird happened.

I turned the hot water on, stepped under the stream, closed my eyes and began running my hands across my skin. My entire body felt tacky and gross. I reached up to find that my hair felt the same way‚Äîit had formed into five or six clumps on the top of my head. *Yuck.* Instantly, I pulled my hand away and opened my eyes to grab the shampoo bottle. That's when I noticed it. 

The water that was dripping from my body was milky white. *What the fuck?* I jumped back from the shower head and looked up. The water coming out of it was clear. I scrunched my eyebrows, then slowly looked back down. The thick, milky drippings had started to collect in a pile, clogging up the drain. 

I tried to slide the clump away with my foot, only to have it spread itself in between my toes, like when you step on a glob of peanut butter. It sent a shiver down my spine, and I started flapping my foot around trying to fling the goop off of it, but it wasn't moving. So, I reached down to dislodge whatever it was by hand. Just then, I was hit with an oddly familiar scent. The same one that had filled the air of that bakery. *Sugar.* 

*Jesus H. Christ*‚Äîdid I try to fuck it?! Just how much icing did I smear on myself? Shit, I must've rubbed that fucking donut all over my body. Hell no, man. I've done some weird shit in my life, but never with food. That thing must've been drugged! 

My hand shot up to my forehead, and my eyes raced back and forth as I desperately tried to remember anything at all from the ten minutes or so I had blacked out. Nothing. Not a damn thing. God, I *had* to have been slipped something. That was the only explanation that made sense.

My heart started pounding and I began to feel woozy. I was obviously under the influence of some type of drug, but I had no idea what. I quickly washed my hair, then grabbed the loofah and started frantically scrubbing my body from the top down. 

When I reached my butt, I used my hand to wash in between my cheeks since the loofah's too rough. I was immediately disgusted to find there were little specks of something buried deep within my ass crack. 

I didn't even need to look‚ÄîI knew what they were. But still, there I was, gawking down at my hand in complete and utter shock nonetheless. Sprinkles. At least a dozen or more. 

I was ashamed and completely disgusted with myself. I couldn't believe I'd actually scratched my ass while eating that donut! Shit, hopefully I waited until after I was finished. But, either way, that meant my fingers were... and then I... Oh, *God.* 

Whatever‚Äînothing I could do about it now. I rinsed the butt sprinkles from my hand, then continued down to my legs. They were dry. Like, *really* dry. I'm talking sandpaper. Large flakes of my skin started to slough off as I scrubbed, plopping onto the shower floor like tiny, wet crepes. 

I've never been good about moisturizing, and to be honest, I usually don't even wash anything below the knees, but today I had to. They must've just been overdue for a good exfoliating, I thought. 

Once I got out and toweled myself off, I noticed my upper body felt waxy and smooth. Too smooth. It was like a slight, buttery layer of film sitting on top of my skin. My bottom half was the opposite. I thought all those skin flakes coming off would've helped, but my legs still looked extremely dry‚Äîalmost scaly. I dropped the towel and reached down with my bare hand. When my fingers touched one of the flaked-off portions of my calf, my heart sank. My skin... it felt *crispy.*

Hell no‚ÄîI am *not* dealing with this right now. I'll just lotion them later if they still feel rough when I sober up. I shook my head, then leaned forward over the sink to look into the mirror. My pupils were enormous, and a fresh coat of glaze covered my face with a lustrous, glossy sheen. 

*Shit... you're tripping balls, man.*

There was nothing I could do but try to wait it out. If I went to the hospital and started explaining my '*symptoms*', I'd be fitted for a brand new pair of grippy socks in a heartbeat. No. There was no need to panic. I just needed to let whatever the hell drug this was wear off. Run its course. Yeah, it's no big deal. It'll be okay.

I thought sleep would be the answer. So, I hurried off to my bedroom and started covering all the windows with dark blankets to block out the midday sun as best I could. I didn't even bother putting clothes back on‚ÄîI figured I'd end up sweating like a pig during this detox anyway. No need to dirty another pair of underwear. 

By the time I'd finished blacking out the room, I was already starting to feel like I was burning up. It was like an oven had suddenly kicked on inside me. I plopped myself down onto the bed, splayed out like a starfish, and waited. 

First, the nausea returned. I had to close my eyes to stop the ceiling from spinning. Then, the heat within me intensified. This fierce burning sensation started to tear through my body, radiating deep from my core. *Oh, God.* It was almost unbearable. I clenched onto the bedsheet underneath me with both fists and tried desperately to control my breathing. A buzzing sensation began to spread through my body, like every cell inside me vibrating all at once. My eyes rolled into the back of my head, and the room went black. 

When I woke up, the slivers of sunlight that had been peering out from the sides of the blankets were gone. My eyes darted over to the little red numbers piercing through the darkness of my room. It was 5:00 AM. *Jesus Christ*, I'd slept the entire rest of the day and all through the night. 

I remained still for a moment, trying to assess my mental and physical state, praying everything had gone back to normal. The nausea had passed, but my body was still burning up. My mouth was unbelievably dry, and the air in my room felt stagnant and heavy. It seemed to push down from above like a weighted blanket‚Äîsmothering me. I forced in a deep breath, and when I did, I noticed the smell. That fucking *smell.*

However, it wasn't until I attempted to reach up and wipe my face that I began to truly realize the horror I'd woken up to. My arm. It wouldn't move‚Äîit was stuck to the bed. The other one, too. And... and my legs. *What the fuck??* My head shot up in a panic, and the pillow came with it.

When I looked down at my body, my jaw dropped open. I was huge. I'm talking gigantic. Bloated, puffy, and round beyond belief. I'd gone from a size 34 pants to at least a 52. Not even joking. It was like I'd gained a hundred pounds overnight. I couldn't believe it. This couldn't be happening. I'd slept almost 20 hours‚Äîthe drug should've worn off!

As I glared down in shock, I could see that my now rotund upper body was caked in a thick, opaque layer of pasty goop. It had dripped and clung to the bed, sticking to the skin of my back and arms like a human glue trap. 

From the waist down, I was surrounded by a large, dark red stain on the sheets. Is that‚Äî? *No. Can't be.* I blinked a few times, then squinted as my eyes strained to adjust. The mystery red liquid had dried to a crust at the edges, forming a giant congealed mass beneath me. 

I struggled to lift myself up further, forcing my neck forward as hard as I could. Then, I gave myself one good push. As my body squished against itself, more of the thick red goo suddenly appeared... oozing‚Ä¶ from my fucking belly button.

The secretion slowly slid from the side of my stomach into the pile below, landing with a wet *plap.* Instinct took over, and I started to thrash and writhe against the bed, desperate to free myself from this disgusting, sticky goop from hell. 

Peeling my top half from the sheets felt like ripping off a massive band-aid. Thick white strings clung to me as the gummy substance stretched and pulled at my skin, trying to force me back down. I bit down hard on my bottom lip and just went for it. I'll admit it‚ÄîI screamed. Screamed like a bitch. 

Once my arms were free, I moved on to my legs. The red stuff was worse. Much thicker, less give. It was agonizing. Huge, crispy strips of flesh tore from my legs, remaining glued to the clotted red mess that had leaked from my unrecognizably grotesque body. After I'd completely broken free from my adhesive prison, I hobbled to the bathroom, dripping the entire way. 

I stared at myself in the mirror, my gargantuan, sugar-slathered body shaking uncontrollably. *Fuck*. I shouldn't have just gone to sleep. I should have dealt with this when I had the chance. That donut wasn't drugged, it was cursed. Something in it. A demon‚Äîpossessing me. Changing me. It had hollowed me out and was growing inside me.

I collapsed onto the cold floor and buried my face in my hands as I began to cry. Not tears, of course. Instead of droplets of wetness, I felt little taps of grit. I ripped my hands away from my eyes. 

Sprinkles. Rainbow fucking sprinkles. 

An animalistic shriek erupted from my lungs, and I hurled them across the room. They hit the wall with a *ping*, scattering all over the floor like confetti at my funeral. Mocking me. 

I pulled myself back up to my feet, limped over to the shower, and got in. I scrubbed, wincing in pain as the loofah scraped against my raw skin. To distract myself, I started trying to weigh my options. I couldn't ignore this anymore. I knew I needed help, desperately. I just didn't know who to turn to. Shit, doctors wouldn't know what to do with me at this point‚Äîwhatever was happening to me had very quickly devolved into something modern medicine couldn't do shit about. 

I thought about calling my cousin, Sonia, in Maine. Her husband had gone through some weird body shit recently. Maybe she'd know what to do. She'd been vague about the details of what happened to him when she told me about it a few months ago. Something about fish? What I did remember was she had been very clear about one thing: it didn't end well. 

Scratch that. If she couldn't help him, she definitely couldn't help me either. I gripped the loofah tighter, my body trembling from the pain and fear. I had to do something. I couldn't allow myself to crumble under the weight of my insane circumstance. I refused to let this *thing* take over. 

I shuffled out of the tub, almost slipping on the pink sludge I'd left behind as I lifted my massive, jiggly leg over the side. I carefully dried myself off, soaking up the leftover glaze from my creases. Then, I shakily began trying to bandage up the gaping wounds on my legs.

They were oozing the same shit that had come out of my belly button. I set a piece of gauze down on top of one of the rips in my flesh, and the redness seeped through instantly. It wasn't blood. Deep down, I already knew that. Still, I reached down, scooped up a dollop with my fingers, and sniffed it. *Strawberry.*

Whatever the fuck was happening to me, I was powerless to stop it alone. There was only one thing left I could do. So, I threw a blanket over my half-glazed naked body, since none of my clothes fit anymore, then scuttled out to my car and began tearing down the street‚Äîheaded toward that fucking bakery.

The door slammed against the wall with a loud bang as I busted through. The stupid little bell dislodged and went sliding across the floor. The place was empty, except for the lady behind the counter. She looked up at me and smiled. 

""Welcome back! Did you enjoy your donut, sir?""

I just stood there in the doorway for a moment, completely dumbfounded, as her smile widened into a sinister, toothy grin. Did I *enjoy* the donut? The sheer audacity of this woman. There I was, shaped like a fucking eclair, covered in only a blanket and dripping red goop everywhere. I sure as shit did not.¬† A fiery rage began to simmer within me. And then, I exploded.

*""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO THAT DONUT?!?!‚Äù*

She laughed. 

""Why, nothing, sir. Nothing at all.""

""Bullshit! What the fuck is happening to me?!"" I demanded. 

""Exactly what was meant to happen,"" she answered. 

""You cursed it! *Christ,* I fucking knew it!! What is this, huh? Some kinda donut voodoo shop?!""

She shook her head and chuckled dismissively.¬† 

""Sir, I just sell the donuts. I don't make them."" 

I stormed up to the counter and threw the sticky blanket down onto the ground, revealing the gruesome form I was now trapped inside of.  

""I don't give a shit who makes them! I want to know why the hell this is happening to my body!!"" 

""Isn't it obvious?"" she giggled. ""You are what you eat."" 

I slammed my fist down onto the counter.

""I want to see your fucking manager, NOW!""

""Of course, sir. Right this way.""

She calmly stepped away from the register and gestured for me to follow her to the back of the bakery. I stomped down the long, sterile, white hallway as she casually led the way, glancing over her shoulder every so often with a smirk. I didn't know what I was going to say when I got to wherever we were going, but I needed answers‚Äîand this bitch apparently wasn't going to tell me jack shit. 

We reached a large door at the end of the hall with a sign that said '*MDI*' in big, bold, red letters. It was fitted with a padlock and a keypad near the handle. The lady pulled out a set of keys and fiddled with them while I waited impatiently. Finally, she opened the lock, unlatched the door, then hovered over the keypad as she punched the numbers in. A loud beep pierced through the silence, and the door slowly squealed open. 

Inside that room was the most incomprehensible horror I could've ever dared to imagine. A being so grotesque‚Äîso shocking. It froze me in place as I struggled to make sense of the unholy sight before me. 

It filled the entire room. Not only in size, but in presence. It felt ancient. And powerful. Something beyond this world... this universe. I was in awe, and yet, overwhelmed with revulsion at what I was forced to behold.

Thick, pulsating lines of bulging, red jelly snaked around doughy coils of glossy, beige flesh like veins. Layers of soured pink icing dripped from beneath a heap of encrusted rainbow sprinkles embedded firmly atop its hideous, glistening mass. This sickeningly enormous body made of sugar, fried dough, and strawberry-flavored goop terrified me to my absolute core. 

It had no eyes‚Äîjust mouths. Dozens upon dozens of perfectly round gaping holes stretched across the front of it, each filled with rows of tiny, sharp, crystalline teeth that sparkled under the heat lamps above. 

And, it breathed. The coils slowly lifted and fell like folds in a stomach, as gurgling globs of chunky red viscera sputtered from the center. Steam radiated from its crispy posterior. Each time it shifted, the smell of sugar and yeast filled the air. Suffocatingly sweet and warm with rot. 

Suddenly, the door slammed shut behind me. I tore my eyes away from the monstrosity to look at the counter lady, who was now standing in front of the door, blocking my only way out. 

""*What the fuck is that?*"" I uttered with wide eyes. 

She narrowed her gaze, and the smile dropped from her face.

""Mother Donut calls to us all... and we answer."" 

I turned to look back at the oozing, demonic atrocity. 

""*This?* This is what I'm turning into?!"" 

""No, don't be ridiculous,"" she said. ""This is what created you. And those who came before you. Go on‚Äîspeak to her. Ask your questions."" 

I gulped hard as I looked up at this sugary mammoth towering over me, then finally mustered up the courage to ask, 

""What's happening to me? What... *am* I?""

The plethora of holes began to move in unison as the bellowing growl of a hundred voices emitted from the effulgent mass at once. 

""You are my offspring. My sweet creation. And from within you, my seed shall spread.""

Blackness crept in from the corners of my vision as I zeroed in on this ungodly creature. I was no longer afraid. I was furious. I'd been infected with some sort of parasitic donut spawn? And for what‚Äîall because I just wanted to enjoy my cheat day? What kind of horse shit is that?? It wasn't fair... I deserved a treat!

""No, the fuck it will not!"" I screamed. ""You better undo this shit right now! Fix me back like I was or..."" 

My voice began to crack with desperation. 

""Or, I'll fucking kill you!! I didn't sign up for this shit, man! It... it was just a God damned donut!""

Giant, red bubbles suddenly spewed from her center mass like lava from a volcano. They popped and splattered my face with piping hot, rotten jelly as a guttural laugh vibrated from the mouths. 

""It cannot be undone,"" she said. ""The transformation is nearly complete, my child."" 

""Please... *oh, God*... no!"" I begged. ""I don't deserve this!!""

She growled. 

""You chose this. You agreed to it. The terms of purchase were stated clearly on the receipt you left behind on the counter without a glance."" 

The room went dead silent. I was too late. Too stupid. Too fucking self-indulgent and careless to prevent my own demise. There was nothing I could do‚Äînothing left to say. It was time to deal with this. Time to face the facts. I was fucked. 

Sprinkles began to trickle down my face. The oven inside me suddenly shot up to 350 degrees. I bolted towards her‚Äîfull speed, fists wailing. If I was going down, this bitch was coming with me. 

Just before I reached her, I felt a sudden, sharp pain in the back of my head. I fell backward, and my body hit the ground instantly with a massive thud. I looked up and saw the counter lady standing over me, now blurry, and holding a rolling pin. Then... darkness, and the faint echo of a wet, bubbling laugh. 

When I awoke, I couldn't move, but I could see. My eyes darted all around. I was no longer in the lair of the beast. Instead, I was in a white room, surrounded by a warm, fuzzy, bright light. Everything looked soft and inviting. Placid. Peaceful. Perfect. I thought I had died. I thought maybe I was in heaven. I couldn't have been more wrong. 

*BAM!!!!!*

A giant fingertip slammed down from above, pressing hard against some sort of invisible forcefield around me. It was... it was *glass*. I was under a fucking glass dome‚Äîlying next to a chocolate whore. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. Panic surged through my jelly-filled veins.

I was paralyzed. Powerless. Positively petrified. My strawberry heart thrashed hard against my pink-slathered, rainbow-sprinkled chest as a booming voice rattled the tray beneath me. 

It said,

""This one.""",6,1755606394.0,TheCrypticCompendium,5,1.0,False
1mugyx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1mugyx8/the_donut_that_never_left/,The Donut That Never Left,"Jelly-filled. Pink icing and rainbow sprinkles delicately blanketed the top of its exquisite, glistening mass. This delightfully devious little body made of sugar, fried dough, and strawberry-flavored goop tempted me to the point of no return. I pressed the tip of my index finger against the glass and said,

""This one.""

I knew I shouldn't have. But I'd been so good lately. I deserved a treat. And besides, I'd make up for it at the gym later, then pound a fuck-ton of water and flush that bitch right out. Yeah, it's no big deal. It's Friday: cheat day. And this week's been hell. I *needed* this.

""That'll be $1.99, sir.""

The lady at the counter smiled and handed me the bulging bag. I held it close, pressing its warm weight against my chest. My mouth pooled with saliva as I slid her my debit card. 

""Anything else?""

I glanced back toward the glass dome filled with plump pastries, then shook my head. They all looked like whores, slathered in chocolate and cheaply seductive‚Äîno substance. Nope, I had everything I needed right here in this greasy white paper bag. *Mine* had fruit. She handed my card back over and said, 

""Have a nice day!""

I grinned, looking down at the bag cradled in my arms. I sure as shit will, I thought. Then, I hurried back to my car to devour this goddess of a donut in seclusion. I needed privacy; this was a moment to be savored. Carefully, I eased my hand into the bag's opening until the tips of my fingers met her soft, pillowy posterior. Once I'd gripped onto the end, I gently pulled to reveal divine perfection. 

The icing lay undisturbed; every single sprinkle had held on. It didn't feel right to just go in at it. No, it was too beautiful to be ravaged like that. It begged to be adored and cherished‚Äîworshiped. I couldn't just bite into this donut like some sort of monster. The jelly would spill out all over, and I didn't have any napkins. 
 
I held it up to my face, admiring the flawless sheen of its glaze in the soft morning light. I inhaled deeply, slowly taking in the heavenly scent that filled me with euphoria. Then, I slid my tongue gently across the surface of its sweet, crispy skin. And that's where it all began. This simple little act of mindless self-indulgence would later become the single biggest regret of my life.

Yet, a smile crept across my face as the intense warmth of this magnificent exterior overwhelmed me. I had one thought, and one thought only: I needed to get to what was inside. Slowly, I sank my teeth deep into its sugary flesh, carefully removing the tiniest of morsels and releasing a floodgate of warm, red jelly. I let the intoxicating, chunky viscus pour into my mouth and surrendered to the ecstasy. 

After that, I blacked out.

When I came to, I'd devoured the whole thing. Not a trace of it remained; even my fingers had been licked clean and sucked dry. I searched the bag, hoping there might be a tiny smidge of icing left behind, but nothing. Not even a sprinkle. It was all gone. *Shit,* I don't even get to keep the memory of enjoying it? Why did I scarf it down so quickly? 

The only evidence that I'd even done so was the lump pressing hard at the back of my throat as the last bite of my breakfast made its way down my esophagus and onto the gullet. Guess I need to work on that whole *'self-control'* thing.

As I drove to work in my sugared-up intoxication, the lump began to squirm. Must be a burp trying to come out, I thought; probably swallowed a fuck ton of air during my binge-fit. I slammed my fist against my chest, but it didn't help. Instead, I could feel my throat tightening around the bulge, trying to push it down. No‚Äîthe opposite. It felt like that hunk of donut was forcing its way down, in spite of my body trying to stop it. What the fuck. 

My eyes watered as I began to cough, choking on the wad of dough that had now firmly planted itself just above my sternum. The bitch wasn't moving at all. I struggled to keep my eyes on the road as I frantically searched the floor of my passenger seat for a half-empty bottle of water. Finally, I laid my hand on one, leaned my head back, and chugged. 

Down she went, without a fight. I smiled and threw the empty bottle back down onto the floor where it belonged. Then, I took a deep breath of relief. *God,* how stupid would it have been if I'd choked to death on a fucking donut? Embarrassing. I wiped my eyes and continued down the road. 

By the time I got to work, the donut had reached my stomach, landing like a boulder dropped off a cliff. I ran to the bathroom, thinking I had to take a shit. I sat in that stall straining for at least 10 minutes, but nothing came out. So, I stood up and pulled my pants back on. Then, I turned around and looked at the toilet. I froze. There, floating in the water, was a single blue sprinkle.

My eyes widened, and I blinked a few times. Then, I leaned forward to make sure I was really seeing what I thought I was. Yep‚Äîa sprinkle. Not a poop-sized one. A regular one. My body snapped upright. No fucking way that came out of my butt. It had to have been on my pants. I just didn't notice. Yeah, of course, that's what it was.

I walked from the bathroom laughing at myself for getting freaked out, even momentarily. My stomach was still killing me, though. The damn donut was sloshing around in the water I'd chugged like a ship caught in a storm. With each step I took, I could feel it rocking back and forth. 

*Gurgle, gurgle. Slosh, slosh.*

When I got to my desk, I started searching around in all the drawers for a roll of Tums. I got excited for a second, until I realized it was just the empty wrapper I'd left myself to be fooled by later. Past me is such an asshole. 

*Gurrrrrp!*

""Shut up.""

Fuck. I had to do something, and quickly. My stomach was visibly rippling at that point, and I could barely stay seated. I thought about undoing my belt, but I didn't want to get accused of being a pervert. Especially not after I accidentally elbowed Sharon from accounting in the boob last week. That was her fault for crowding me at the coffee pot, though. Unfortunately, HR didn't see it that way.

Wait‚Äîcoffee! That'll make me shit, I thought. Even though my stomach was past maximum capacity, it seemed like my only option. Besides, a shot of black coffee to the gut might just actually do the trick to move this mass along. The bitch had already overstayed her welcome. It was time for an eviction notice. 

I hurried to the break room to find Sharon at the coffee pot. *Of course.* I kept my distance as we silently exchanged awkward glances. I didn't want to look her in the eye, so I stared at the coffee pot in her hands instead. I was so uncomfortable. I could barely keep still as my gurgles and groans echoed through the otherwise empty room. She cut her pour short, grabbed a handful of Sweet'N Low packets, then rushed out of the door while covering her nose. *Pftt*‚Äîprobably thought I was farting. Believe me, lady. I wish I *could* fart.

I poured a splash and a half into my cup and threw it back, still scalding. It burned all the way down, but I didn't care. The pain in my throat was a welcome distraction from the mayhem that was going on in my stomach. The roof of my mouth was going to be fucked for a day or two. But, I figured, if it worked, it would all be worth it. After all, this was my last-ditch effort to be able to make it through the rest of my workday. 

It also turned out to be a big mistake.

The searing black liquid landed with an eruption. I immediately doubled over in the worst pain I'd ever felt in my life. The wad of sugary dough had begun to thrash violently, slamming itself against the walls of my stomach. No, I'm not fucking joking. I could feel it. Not just in my stomach‚Äîwith my hands, too. I literally felt this donut pounding from the inside out, lifting my skin as it pushed against its gastric prison. 

I ran full speed to the bathroom, praying I'd make it there before I passed out, vomited, or shit my pants. Or, all three. My belly bounced as I ran, suddenly swollen like a puppy with worms. I thought I was bloated before, but now I was literally about to pop. The movement made the pain infinitely worse, but I had no choice. Fuck this. It had to come out.

The stall door slammed against the wall, and I fell to my knees, gripping the toilet in preparation. My face was ice-cold and clammy. Warm saliva flooded my mouth. Yes! Come out! Be gone, bitch! 

*GUUURRRPPP*

I began to heave and spit into the toilet. The mass was so close I could taste it, but nothing was coming out. It was fighting me. I shoved my finger down into my throat, scraping against the burnt roof of my mouth. I winced from the pain, and my eyes started watering uncontrollably. A few gags, and up she came. 

A putrid flurry of pink sludge spewed from my mouth, swirled with a deep, crimson red foam. It splattered back up into my face when it hit the toilet at lightning speed. Fuck, so much came out of me, I can't even explain it. But that was only phase one. Next came the chunks. 

By the time I was done, I thought I was going to lose consciousness. The room was spinning, and I struggled to catch my breath, so I lowered myself onto the floor, still hugging the toilet. 

I couldn't help but inspect this ungodly force that had just come out of me. Slowly, I lifted my head and peeked over the seat. *Holy fuck.* I gazed down at the thick pink vomit in utter shock and disgust. Shit, it looked like I'd barely even chewed this donut. Even the rainbow sprinkles had all remained whole, floating around in the sludge like tiny specks of whimsy in a cotton candy-colored massacre. Surrounding them were a few large globs of fleshy beige, accompanied by several smaller red clumps. *Christ.* I just *had* to get the one with fruit, huh?

Suddenly, my eyes fixed on the largest red chunk floating in the middle of the sludge. It looked different than the other ones. Shaped weird. And it was... *moving?* I wiped my eyes. Yes‚Äîit was fucking moving! Convulsing. Constricting. Sputtering red goop from both ends. *No fucking way.*

I stood up so fast, I nearly fell backwards out of the stall. Black spots began to appear in my line of vision. I gripped onto the threshold with both hands as I swayed, trying to regain balance. I held my breath and slowly leaned forward to look again. It stopped.

Oh, thank God. It *wasn't* moving. Get it together, bro. It's just a chunk of strawberry; how could it be moving? I almost wanted to poke at it, but considering how vile the mess I'd made in the toilet was, I resisted that urge.

The hinges of the bathroom door creaked, and footsteps began to approach. I quickly reached over and flushed the rainbow sprinkled slurry. It smelled like death‚Äîsickly sweet with a hint of berry. I desperately tried to fan the stink away with one hand while wiping my face with the other.

When I exited the stall, Jerry from sales was at the urinal. He turned to look at me as I approached the sink, visibly disgusted by the pungent odor that had completely filled the room at that point.  

""Gnarly case of food poisoning,"" I told him. 

He nodded, then focused his eyes back in front of him. With a splash of water and a squirt of soap, I quickly washed my hands and ran out of there. On the way back to my desk, I bumped into my boss, who promptly asked what the hell I'd been doing all morning. 

""Sorry, sir. I think I'm coming down with something.""

He folded his arms in front of him and scrunched his eyebrows. 

""That's the excuse you're going with this time?""

""Ask Jerry, he'll tell you. I was just in the bathroom. If you want proof, go in there and take a big whiff."" 

""Alright, that's enough,"" he said. ""Just make sure that report is on my desk before lunch, then you can leave if you need to. And don't forget, you're still on disciplinary probation after last week.""

""Yes, sir.""

Fuck. I forgot all about that damn report. I hadn't even started it yet, and it was almost 10:00. At least my stomach was starting to feel better. My abs were sore from all the heaving, but now that just meant I could skip the gym later. I'd already puked up the donut anyway, so the carbs didn't count. 

Shit, what a weird ass morning I was having‚Äîalmost got killed by a donut twice. What an evil bitch! She tempted me, then tortured me. Well, lesson learned. Not going back to that bakery again. At least now she was gone, and it was over. 

I sat down at my desk, opened up a Word document, and began typing nonsense. My thoughts were all jumbled up, and my head was throbbing from straining so hard. I kept having to retype each sentence over and over until it made sense. Before I knew it, another hour had gone by, and I was sweating. 

My hand reached up to wipe away the droplets accumulating on the ridge of my brow. Right away, I noticed something weird. My sweat was thick. Like... *goop.* I slowly pulled my hand away in confusion to look at the substance that had just excreted from my pores. 

It was clear, like sweat's supposed to be. But there was a ton of it. And it didn't drip. No‚Äîinstead, it gathered in a rounded clump at the edge of my fingertips. Then, I pressed my fingers together. It was sticky, too. *Oh, god.* I slowly raised my hand up to my lips and tasted. It was fucking *sugar.*

Okay... something weird is definitely going on. What the fuck was in that donut?! I had to leave work. Immediately. To hell with this damn report. I needed to go home and start googling. And also take a shower, because my face and hands were all sticky. Oh‚Äîand I still smelled like vomit, too. 

I got up and left everything on my desk as it was, including the open document of word salad on my computer screen. Hopefully, my boss would see all that and realize this was an emergency. If not, oh well, whatever. I'll just deal with it on Monday, I thought.

I raced home, taking a different route to avoid having to pass that bakery. I felt like just the sight of it might make me sick again. There had to be something wrong with that donut. I felt totally normal until I met that sugary bitch. Maybe it really was food poisoning. *Fuck*‚Äîthe strawberries! E. coli, duh. *Damn*, should've gotten one of the whores; chocolate would've never betrayed me like that.

Food poisoning didn't exactly explain the sugary sweat, but I was still convinced that's what it was. Maybe I got so sick, I'd started hallucinating? Yeah, that *had* to be it. Ha! That donut wasn't actually thrashing in my stomach. The strawberry chunk wasn't ever moving. And the goopy sweat? Probably just some leftover glaze I didn't realize was there. *Pftt.* I shook my head and chuckled to myself. There was nothing to worry about. It'll pass.

I got home, threw my keys onto the side table, and headed straight for the bathroom. I decided to brush my teeth first. My breath was so rank I couldn't stand it anymore, and the taste of sugar and stomach acid still lingered on my tongue. I brushed the hell out of my entire mouth for at least 2 1/2 minutes, then spit into the sink. When I saw what had come out of my mouth, I almost choked. 

Sprinkles. A bunch of them. God, how did they all get stuck in my teeth like that? How did I not feel them? I cupped my hand under the faucet and rinsed my mouth out a few times. Each time I spit, more came out. It seemed to be an endless supply of them, like there was a God damned sprinkle dispenser somewhere behind my molars. But finally, after the fifth rinse, I ran my tongue across my teeth and didn't feel any more. So, I got into the shower and figured if anything else weird happened, I'd just worry about it then.

Then, something else weird happened.

I turned the hot water on, stepped under the stream, closed my eyes and began running my hands across my skin. My entire body felt tacky and gross. I reached up to find that my hair felt the same way‚Äîit had formed into five or six clumps on the top of my head. *Yuck.* Instantly, I pulled my hand away and opened my eyes to grab the shampoo bottle. That's when I noticed it. 

The water that was dripping from my body was milky white. *What the fuck?* I jumped back from the shower head and looked up. The water coming out of it was clear. I scrunched my eyebrows, then slowly looked back down. The thick, milky drippings had started to collect in a pile, clogging up the drain. 

I tried to slide the clump away with my foot, only to have it spread itself in between my toes, like when you step on a glob of peanut butter. It sent a shiver down my spine, and I started flapping my foot around trying to fling the goop off of it, but it wasn't moving. So, I reached down to dislodge whatever it was by hand. Just then, I was hit with an oddly familiar scent. The same one that had filled the air of that bakery. *Sugar.* 

*Jesus H. Christ*‚Äîdid I try to fuck it?! Just how much icing did I smear on myself? Shit, I must've rubbed that fucking donut all over my body. Hell no, man. I've done some weird shit in my life, but never with food. That thing must've been drugged! 

My hand shot up to my forehead, and my eyes raced back and forth as I desperately tried to remember anything at all from the ten minutes or so I had blacked out. Nothing. Not a damn thing. God, I *had* to have been slipped something. That was the only explanation that made sense.

My heart started pounding and I began to feel woozy. I was obviously under the influence of some type of drug, but I had no idea what. I quickly washed my hair, then grabbed the loofah and started frantically scrubbing my body from the top down. 

When I reached my butt, I used my hand to wash in between my cheeks since the loofah's too rough. I was immediately disgusted to find there were little specks of something buried deep within my ass crack. 

I didn't even need to look‚ÄîI knew what they were. But still, there I was, gawking down at my hand in complete and utter shock nonetheless. Sprinkles. At least a dozen or more. 

I was ashamed and completely disgusted with myself. I couldn't believe I'd actually scratched my ass while eating that donut! Shit, hopefully I waited until after I was finished. But, either way, that meant my fingers were... and then I... Oh, *God.* 

Whatever‚Äînothing I could do about it now. I rinsed the butt sprinkles from my hand, then continued down to my legs. They were dry. Like, *really* dry. I'm talking sandpaper. Large flakes of my skin started to slough off as I scrubbed, plopping onto the shower floor like tiny, wet crepes. 

I've never been good about moisturizing, and to be honest, I usually don't even wash anything below the knees, but today I had to. They must've just been overdue for a good exfoliating, I thought. 

Once I got out and toweled myself off, I noticed my upper body felt waxy and smooth. Too smooth. It was like a slight, buttery layer of film sitting on top of my skin. My bottom half was the opposite. I thought all those skin flakes coming off would've helped, but my legs still looked extremely dry‚Äîalmost scaly. I dropped the towel and reached down with my bare hand. When my fingers touched one of the flaked-off portions of my calf, my heart sank. My skin... it felt *crispy.*

Hell no‚ÄîI am *not* dealing with this right now. I'll just lotion them later if they still feel rough when I sober up. I shook my head, then leaned forward over the sink to look into the mirror. My pupils were enormous, and a fresh coat of glaze covered my face with a lustrous, glossy sheen. 

*Shit... you're tripping balls, man.*

There was nothing I could do but try to wait it out. If I went to the hospital and started explaining my '*symptoms*', I'd be fitted for a brand new pair of grippy socks in a heartbeat. No. There was no need to panic. I just needed to let whatever the hell drug this was wear off. Run its course. Yeah, it's no big deal. It'll be okay.

I thought sleep would be the answer. So, I hurried off to my bedroom and started covering all the windows with dark blankets to block out the midday sun as best I could. I didn't even bother putting clothes back on‚ÄîI figured I'd end up sweating like a pig during this detox anyway. No need to dirty another pair of underwear. 

By the time I'd finished blacking out the room, I was already starting to feel like I was burning up. It was like an oven had suddenly kicked on inside me. I plopped myself down onto the bed, splayed out like a starfish, and waited. 

First, the nausea returned. I had to close my eyes to stop the ceiling from spinning. Then, the heat within me intensified. This fierce burning sensation started to tear through my body, radiating deep from my core. *Oh, God.* It was almost unbearable. I clenched onto the bedsheet underneath me with both fists and tried desperately to control my breathing. A buzzing sensation began to spread through my body, like every cell inside me vibrating all at once. My eyes rolled into the back of my head, and the room went black. 

When I woke up, the slivers of sunlight that had been peering out from the sides of the blankets were gone. My eyes darted over to the little red numbers piercing through the darkness of my room. It was 5:00 AM. *Jesus Christ*, I'd slept the entire rest of the day and all through the night. 

I remained still for a moment, trying to assess my mental and physical state, praying everything had gone back to normal. The nausea had passed, but my body was still burning up. My mouth was unbelievably dry, and the air in my room felt stagnant and heavy. It seemed to push down from above like a weighted blanket‚Äîsmothering me. I forced in a deep breath, and when I did, I noticed the smell. That fucking *smell.*

However, it wasn't until I attempted to reach up and wipe my face that I began to truly realize the horror I'd woken up to. My arm. It wouldn't move‚Äîit was stuck to the bed. The other one, too. And... and my legs. *What the fuck??* My head shot up in a panic, and the pillow came with it.

When I looked down at my body, my jaw dropped open. I was huge. I'm talking gigantic. Bloated, puffy, and round beyond belief. I'd gone from a size 34 pants to at least a 52. Not even joking. It was like I'd gained a hundred pounds overnight. I couldn't believe it. This couldn't be happening. I'd slept almost 20 hours‚Äîthe drug should've worn off!

As I glared down in shock, I could see that my now rotund upper body was caked in a thick, opaque layer of pasty goop. It had dripped and clung to the bed, sticking to the skin of my back and arms like a human glue trap. 

From the waist down, I was surrounded by a large, dark red stain on the sheets. Is that‚Äî? *No. Can't be.* I blinked a few times, then squinted as my eyes strained to adjust. The mystery red liquid had dried to a crust at the edges, forming a giant congealed mass beneath me. 

I struggled to lift myself up further, forcing my neck forward as hard as I could. Then, I gave myself one good push. As my body squished against itself, more of the thick red goo suddenly appeared... oozing‚Ä¶ from my fucking belly button.

The secretion slowly slid from the side of my stomach into the pile below, landing with a wet *plap.* Instinct took over, and I started to thrash and writhe against the bed, desperate to free myself from this disgusting, sticky goop from hell. 

Peeling my top half from the sheets felt like ripping off a massive band-aid. Thick white strings clung to me as the gummy substance stretched and pulled at my skin, trying to force me back down. I bit down hard on my bottom lip and just went for it. I'll admit it‚ÄîI screamed. Screamed like a bitch. 

Once my arms were free, I moved on to my legs. The red stuff was worse. Much thicker, less give. It was agonizing. Huge, crispy strips of flesh tore from my legs, remaining glued to the clotted red mess that had leaked from my unrecognizably grotesque body. After I'd completely broken free from my adhesive prison, I hobbled to the bathroom, dripping the entire way. 

I stared at myself in the mirror, my gargantuan, sugar-slathered body shaking uncontrollably. *Fuck*. I shouldn't have just gone to sleep. I should have dealt with this when I had the chance. That donut wasn't drugged, it was cursed. Something in it. A demon‚Äîpossessing me. Changing me. It had hollowed me out and was growing inside me.

I collapsed onto the cold floor and buried my face in my hands as I began to cry. Not tears, of course. Instead of droplets of wetness, I felt little taps of grit. I ripped my hands away from my eyes. 

Sprinkles. Rainbow fucking sprinkles. 

An animalistic shriek erupted from my lungs, and I hurled them across the room. They hit the wall with a *ping*, scattering all over the floor like confetti at my funeral. Mocking me. 

I pulled myself back up to my feet, limped over to the shower, and got in. I scrubbed, wincing in pain as the loofah scraped against my raw skin. To distract myself, I started trying to weigh my options. I couldn't ignore this anymore. I knew I needed help, desperately. I just didn't know who to turn to. Shit, doctors wouldn't know what to do with me at this point‚Äîwhatever was happening to me had very quickly devolved into something modern medicine couldn't do shit about. 

I thought about calling my cousin, Sonia, in Maine. Her husband had gone through some weird body shit recently. Maybe she'd know what to do. She'd been vague about the details of what happened to him when she told me about it a few months ago. Something about fish? What I did remember was she had been very clear about one thing: it didn't end well. 

Scratch that. If she couldn't help him, she definitely couldn't help me either. I gripped the loofah tighter, my body trembling from the pain and fear. I had to do something. I couldn't allow myself to crumble under the weight of my insane circumstance. I refused to let this *thing* take over. 

I shuffled out of the tub, almost slipping on the pink sludge I'd left behind as I lifted my massive, jiggly leg over the side. I carefully dried myself off, soaking up the leftover glaze from my creases. Then, I shakily began trying to bandage up the gaping wounds on my legs.

They were oozing the same shit that had come out of my belly button. I set a piece of gauze down on top of one of the rips in my flesh, and the redness seeped through instantly. It wasn't blood. Deep down, I already knew that. Still, I reached down, scooped up a dollop with my fingers, and sniffed it. *Strawberry.*

Whatever the fuck was happening to me, I was powerless to stop it alone. There was only one thing left I could do. So, I threw a blanket over my half-glazed naked body, since none of my clothes fit anymore, then scuttled out to my car and began tearing down the street‚Äîheaded toward that fucking bakery.

The door slammed against the wall with a loud bang as I busted through. The stupid little bell dislodged and went sliding across the floor. The place was empty, except for the lady behind the counter. She looked up at me and smiled. 

""Welcome back! Did you enjoy your donut, sir?""

I just stood there in the doorway for a moment, completely dumbfounded, as her smile widened into a sinister, toothy grin. Did I *enjoy* the donut? The sheer audacity of this woman. There I was, shaped like a fucking eclair, covered in only a blanket and dripping red goop everywhere. I sure as shit did not.¬† A fiery rage began to simmer within me. And then, I exploded.

*""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO THAT DONUT?!?!‚Äù*

She laughed. 

""Why, nothing, sir. Nothing at all.""

""Bullshit! What the fuck is happening to me?!"" I demanded. 

""Exactly what was meant to happen,"" she answered. 

""You cursed it! *Christ,* I fucking knew it!! What is this, huh? Some kinda donut voodoo shop?!""

She shook her head and chuckled dismissively.¬† 

""Sir, I just sell the donuts. I don't make them."" 

I stormed up to the counter and threw the sticky blanket down onto the ground, revealing the gruesome form I was now trapped inside of.  

""I don't give a shit who makes them! I want to know why the hell this is happening to my body!!"" 

""Isn't it obvious?"" she giggled. ""You are what you eat."" 

I slammed my fist down onto the counter.

""I want to see your fucking manager, NOW!""

""Of course, sir. Right this way.""

She calmly stepped away from the register and gestured for me to follow her to the back of the bakery. I stomped down the long, sterile, white hallway as she casually led the way, glancing over her shoulder every so often with a smirk. I didn't know what I was going to say when I got to wherever we were going, but I needed answers‚Äîand this bitch apparently wasn't going to tell me jack shit. 

We reached a large door at the end of the hall with a sign that said '*MDI*' in big, bold, red letters. It was fitted with a padlock and a keypad near the handle. The lady pulled out a set of keys and fiddled with them while I waited impatiently. Finally, she opened the lock, unlatched the door, then hovered over the keypad as she punched the numbers in. A loud beep pierced through the silence, and the door slowly squealed open. 

Inside that room was the most incomprehensible horror I could've ever dared to imagine. A being so grotesque‚Äîso shocking. It froze me in place as I struggled to make sense of the unholy sight before me. 

It filled the entire room. Not only in size, but in presence. It felt ancient. And powerful. Something beyond this world... this universe. I was in awe, and yet, overwhelmed with revulsion at what I was forced to behold.

Thick, pulsating lines of bulging, red jelly snaked around doughy coils of glossy, beige flesh like veins. Layers of soured pink icing dripped from beneath a heap of encrusted rainbow sprinkles embedded firmly atop its hideous, glistening mass. This sickeningly enormous body made of sugar, fried dough, and strawberry-flavored goop terrified me to my absolute core. 

It had no eyes‚Äîjust mouths. Dozens upon dozens of perfectly round gaping holes stretched across the front of it, each filled with rows of tiny, sharp, crystalline teeth that sparkled under the heat lamps above. 

And, it breathed. The coils slowly lifted and fell like folds in a stomach, as gurgling globs of chunky red viscera sputtered from the center. Steam radiated from its crispy posterior. Each time it shifted, the smell of sugar and yeast filled the air. Suffocatingly sweet and warm with rot. 

Suddenly, the door slammed shut behind me. I tore my eyes away from the monstrosity to look at the counter lady, who was now standing in front of the door, blocking my only way out. 

""*What the fuck is that?*"" I uttered with wide eyes. 

She narrowed her gaze, and the smile dropped from her face.

""Mother Donut calls to us all... and we answer."" 

I turned to look back at the oozing, demonic atrocity. 

""*This?* This is what I'm turning into?!"" 

""No, don't be ridiculous,"" she said. ""This is what created you. And those who came before you. Go on‚Äîspeak to her. Ask your questions."" 

I gulped hard as I looked up at this sugary mammoth towering over me, then finally mustered up the courage to ask, 

""What's happening to me? What... *am* I?""

The plethora of holes began to move in unison as the bellowing growl of a hundred voices emitted from the effulgent mass at once. 

""You are my offspring. My sweet creation. And from within you, my seed shall spread.""

Blackness crept in from the corners of my vision as I zeroed in on this ungodly creature. I was no longer afraid. I was furious. I'd been infected with some sort of parasitic donut spawn? And for what‚Äîall because I just wanted to enjoy my cheat day? What kind of horse shit is that?? It wasn't fair... I deserved a treat!

""No, the fuck it will not!"" I screamed. ""You better undo this shit right now! Fix me back like I was or..."" 

My voice began to crack with desperation. 

""Or, I'll fucking kill you!! I didn't sign up for this shit, man! It... it was just a God damned donut!""

Giant, red bubbles suddenly spewed from her center mass like lava from a volcano. They popped and splattered my face with piping hot, rotten jelly as a guttural laugh vibrated from the mouths. 

""It cannot be undone,"" she said. ""The transformation is nearly complete, my child."" 

""Please... *oh, God*... no!"" I begged. ""I don't deserve this!!""

She growled. 

""You chose this. You agreed to it. The terms of purchase were stated clearly on the receipt you left behind on the counter without a glance."" 

The room went dead silent. I was too late. Too stupid. Too fucking self-indulgent and careless to prevent my own demise. There was nothing I could do‚Äînothing left to say. It was time to deal with this. Time to face the facts. I was fucked. 

Sprinkles began to trickle down my face. The oven inside me suddenly shot up to 350 degrees. I bolted towards her‚Äîfull speed, fists wailing. If I was going down, this bitch was coming with me. 

Just before I reached her, I felt a sudden, sharp pain in the back of my head. I fell backward, and my body hit the ground instantly with a massive thud. I looked up and saw the counter lady standing over me, now blurry, and holding a rolling pin. Then... darkness, and the faint echo of a wet, bubbling laugh. 

When I awoke, I couldn't move, but I could see. My eyes darted all around. I was no longer in the lair of the beast. Instead, I was in a white room, surrounded by a warm, fuzzy, bright light. Everything looked soft and inviting. Placid. Peaceful. Perfect. I thought I had died. I thought maybe I was in heaven. I couldn't have been more wrong. 

*BAM!!!!!*

A giant fingertip slammed down from above, pressing hard against some sort of invisible forcefield around me. It was... it was *glass*. I was under a fucking glass dome‚Äîlying next to a chocolate whore. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. Panic surged through my jelly-filled veins.

I was paralyzed. Powerless. Positively petrified. My strawberry heart thrashed hard against my pink-slathered, rainbow-sprinkled chest as a booming voice rattled the tray beneath me. 

It said,

""This one.""",2,1755606387.0,deepnightsociety,0,1.0,False
1mugyty,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1mugyty/the_donut_that_never_left/,The Donut That Never Left,"Jelly-filled. Pink icing and rainbow sprinkles delicately blanketed the top of its exquisite, glistening mass. This delightfully devious little body made of sugar, fried dough, and strawberry-flavored goop tempted me to the point of no return. I pressed the tip of my index finger against the glass and said,

""This one.""

I knew I shouldn't have. But I'd been so good lately. I deserved a treat. And besides, I'd make up for it at the gym later, then pound a fuck-ton of water and flush that bitch right out. Yeah, it's no big deal. It's Friday: cheat day. And this week's been hell. I *needed* this.

""That'll be $1.99, sir.""

The lady at the counter smiled and handed me the bulging bag. I held it close, pressing its warm weight against my chest. My mouth pooled with saliva as I slid her my debit card. 

""Anything else?""

I glanced back toward the glass dome filled with plump pastries, then shook my head. They all looked like whores, slathered in chocolate and cheaply seductive‚Äîno substance. Nope, I had everything I needed right here in this greasy white paper bag. *Mine* had fruit. She handed my card back over and said, 

""Have a nice day!""

I grinned, looking down at the bag cradled in my arms. I sure as shit will, I thought. Then, I hurried back to my car to devour this goddess of a donut in seclusion. I needed privacy; this was a moment to be savored. Carefully, I eased my hand into the bag's opening until the tips of my fingers met her soft, pillowy posterior. Once I'd gripped onto the end, I gently pulled to reveal divine perfection. 

The icing lay undisturbed; every single sprinkle had held on. It didn't feel right to just go in at it. No, it was too beautiful to be ravaged like that. It begged to be adored and cherished‚Äîworshiped. I couldn't just bite into this donut like some sort of monster. The jelly would spill out all over, and I didn't have any napkins. 
 
I held it up to my face, admiring the flawless sheen of its glaze in the soft morning light. I inhaled deeply, slowly taking in the heavenly scent that filled me with euphoria. Then, I slid my tongue gently across the surface of its sweet, crispy skin. And that's where it all began. This simple little act of mindless self-indulgence would later become the single biggest regret of my life.

Yet, a smile crept across my face as the intense warmth of this magnificent exterior overwhelmed me. I had one thought, and one thought only: I needed to get to what was inside. Slowly, I sank my teeth deep into its sugary flesh, carefully removing the tiniest of morsels and releasing a floodgate of warm, red jelly. I let the intoxicating, chunky viscus pour into my mouth and surrendered to the ecstasy. 

After that, I blacked out.

When I came to, I'd devoured the whole thing. Not a trace of it remained; even my fingers had been licked clean and sucked dry. I searched the bag, hoping there might be a tiny smidge of icing left behind, but nothing. Not even a sprinkle. It was all gone. *Shit,* I don't even get to keep the memory of enjoying it? Why did I scarf it down so quickly? 

The only evidence that I'd even done so was the lump pressing hard at the back of my throat as the last bite of my breakfast made its way down my esophagus and onto the gullet. Guess I need to work on that whole *'self-control'* thing.

As I drove to work in my sugared-up intoxication, the lump began to squirm. Must be a burp trying to come out, I thought; probably swallowed a fuck ton of air during my binge-fit. I slammed my fist against my chest, but it didn't help. Instead, I could feel my throat tightening around the bulge, trying to push it down. No‚Äîthe opposite. It felt like that hunk of donut was forcing its way down, in spite of my body trying to stop it. What the fuck. 

My eyes watered as I began to cough, choking on the wad of dough that had now firmly planted itself just above my sternum. The bitch wasn't moving at all. I struggled to keep my eyes on the road as I frantically searched the floor of my passenger seat for a half-empty bottle of water. Finally, I laid my hand on one, leaned my head back, and chugged. 

Down she went, without a fight. I smiled and threw the empty bottle back down onto the floor where it belonged. Then, I took a deep breath of relief. *God,* how stupid would it have been if I'd choked to death on a fucking donut? Embarrassing. I wiped my eyes and continued down the road. 

By the time I got to work, the donut had reached my stomach, landing like a boulder dropped off a cliff. I ran to the bathroom, thinking I had to take a shit. I sat in that stall straining for at least 10 minutes, but nothing came out. So, I stood up and pulled my pants back on. Then, I turned around and looked at the toilet. I froze. There, floating in the water, was a single blue sprinkle.

My eyes widened, and I blinked a few times. Then, I leaned forward to make sure I was really seeing what I thought I was. Yep‚Äîa sprinkle. Not a poop-sized one. A regular one. My body snapped upright. No fucking way that came out of my butt. It had to have been on my pants. I just didn't notice. Yeah, of course, that's what it was.

I walked from the bathroom laughing at myself for getting freaked out, even momentarily. My stomach was still killing me, though. The damn donut was sloshing around in the water I'd chugged like a ship caught in a storm. With each step I took, I could feel it rocking back and forth. 

*Gurgle, gurgle. Slosh, slosh.*

When I got to my desk, I started searching around in all the drawers for a roll of Tums. I got excited for a second, until I realized it was just the empty wrapper I'd left myself to be fooled by later. Past me is such an asshole. 

*Gurrrrrp!*

""Shut up.""

Fuck. I had to do something, and quickly. My stomach was visibly rippling at that point, and I could barely stay seated. I thought about undoing my belt, but I didn't want to get accused of being a pervert. Especially not after I accidentally elbowed Sharon from accounting in the boob last week. That was her fault for crowding me at the coffee pot, though. Unfortunately, HR didn't see it that way.

Wait‚Äîcoffee! That'll make me shit, I thought. Even though my stomach was past maximum capacity, it seemed like my only option. Besides, a shot of black coffee to the gut might just actually do the trick to move this mass along. The bitch had already overstayed her welcome. It was time for an eviction notice. 

I hurried to the break room to find Sharon at the coffee pot. *Of course.* I kept my distance as we silently exchanged awkward glances. I didn't want to look her in the eye, so I stared at the coffee pot in her hands instead. I was so uncomfortable. I could barely keep still as my gurgles and groans echoed through the otherwise empty room. She cut her pour short, grabbed a handful of Sweet'N Low packets, then rushed out of the door while covering her nose. *Pftt*‚Äîprobably thought I was farting. Believe me, lady. I wish I *could* fart.

I poured a splash and a half into my cup and threw it back, still scalding. It burned all the way down, but I didn't care. The pain in my throat was a welcome distraction from the mayhem that was going on in my stomach. The roof of my mouth was going to be fucked for a day or two. But, I figured, if it worked, it would all be worth it. After all, this was my last-ditch effort to be able to make it through the rest of my workday. 

It also turned out to be a big mistake.

The searing black liquid landed with an eruption. I immediately doubled over in the worst pain I'd ever felt in my life. The wad of sugary dough had begun to thrash violently, slamming itself against the walls of my stomach. No, I'm not fucking joking. I could feel it. Not just in my stomach‚Äîwith my hands, too. I literally felt this donut pounding from the inside out, lifting my skin as it pushed against its gastric prison. 

I ran full speed to the bathroom, praying I'd make it there before I passed out, vomited, or shit my pants. Or, all three. My belly bounced as I ran, suddenly swollen like a puppy with worms. I thought I was bloated before, but now I was literally about to pop. The movement made the pain infinitely worse, but I had no choice. Fuck this. It had to come out.

The stall door slammed against the wall, and I fell to my knees, gripping the toilet in preparation. My face was ice-cold and clammy. Warm saliva flooded my mouth. Yes! Come out! Be gone, bitch! 

*GUUURRRPPP*

I began to heave and spit into the toilet. The mass was so close I could taste it, but nothing was coming out. It was fighting me. I shoved my finger down into my throat, scraping against the burnt roof of my mouth. I winced from the pain, and my eyes started watering uncontrollably. A few gags, and up she came. 

A putrid flurry of pink sludge spewed from my mouth, swirled with a deep, crimson red foam. It splattered back up into my face when it hit the toilet at lightning speed. Fuck, so much came out of me, I can't even explain it. But that was only phase one. Next came the chunks. 

By the time I was done, I thought I was going to lose consciousness. The room was spinning, and I struggled to catch my breath, so I lowered myself onto the floor, still hugging the toilet. 

I couldn't help but inspect this ungodly force that had just come out of me. Slowly, I lifted my head and peeked over the seat. *Holy fuck.* I gazed down at the thick pink vomit in utter shock and disgust. Shit, it looked like I'd barely even chewed this donut. Even the rainbow sprinkles had all remained whole, floating around in the sludge like tiny specks of whimsy in a cotton candy-colored massacre. Surrounding them were a few large globs of fleshy beige, accompanied by several smaller red clumps. *Christ.* I just *had* to get the one with fruit, huh?

Suddenly, my eyes fixed on the largest red chunk floating in the middle of the sludge. It looked different than the other ones. Shaped weird. And it was... *moving?* I wiped my eyes. Yes‚Äîit was fucking moving! Convulsing. Constricting. Sputtering red goop from both ends. *No fucking way.*

I stood up so fast, I nearly fell backwards out of the stall. Black spots began to appear in my line of vision. I gripped onto the threshold with both hands as I swayed, trying to regain balance. I held my breath and slowly leaned forward to look again. It stopped.

Oh, thank God. It *wasn't* moving. Get it together, bro. It's just a chunk of strawberry; how could it be moving? I almost wanted to poke at it, but considering how vile the mess I'd made in the toilet was, I resisted that urge.

The hinges of the bathroom door creaked, and footsteps began to approach. I quickly reached over and flushed the rainbow sprinkled slurry. It smelled like death‚Äîsickly sweet with a hint of berry. I desperately tried to fan the stink away with one hand while wiping my face with the other.

When I exited the stall, Jerry from sales was at the urinal. He turned to look at me as I approached the sink, visibly disgusted by the pungent odor that had completely filled the room at that point.  

""Gnarly case of food poisoning,"" I told him. 

He nodded, then focused his eyes back in front of him. With a splash of water and a squirt of soap, I quickly washed my hands and ran out of there. On the way back to my desk, I bumped into my boss, who promptly asked what the hell I'd been doing all morning. 

""Sorry, sir. I think I'm coming down with something.""

He folded his arms in front of him and scrunched his eyebrows. 

""That's the excuse you're going with this time?""

""Ask Jerry, he'll tell you. I was just in the bathroom. If you want proof, go in there and take a big whiff."" 

""Alright, that's enough,"" he said. ""Just make sure that report is on my desk before lunch, then you can leave if you need to. And don't forget, you're still on disciplinary probation after last week.""

""Yes, sir.""

Fuck. I forgot all about that damn report. I hadn't even started it yet, and it was almost 10:00. At least my stomach was starting to feel better. My abs were sore from all the heaving, but now that just meant I could skip the gym later. I'd already puked up the donut anyway, so the carbs didn't count. 

Shit, what a weird ass morning I was having‚Äîalmost got killed by a donut twice. What an evil bitch! She tempted me, then tortured me. Well, lesson learned. Not going back to that bakery again. At least now she was gone, and it was over. 

I sat down at my desk, opened up a Word document, and began typing nonsense. My thoughts were all jumbled up, and my head was throbbing from straining so hard. I kept having to retype each sentence over and over until it made sense. Before I knew it, another hour had gone by, and I was sweating. 

My hand reached up to wipe away the droplets accumulating on the ridge of my brow. Right away, I noticed something weird. My sweat was thick. Like... *goop.* I slowly pulled my hand away in confusion to look at the substance that had just excreted from my pores. 

It was clear, like sweat's supposed to be. But there was a ton of it. And it didn't drip. No‚Äîinstead, it gathered in a rounded clump at the edge of my fingertips. Then, I pressed my fingers together. It was sticky, too. *Oh, god.* I slowly raised my hand up to my lips and tasted. It was fucking *sugar.*

Okay... something weird is definitely going on. What the fuck was in that donut?! I had to leave work. Immediately. To hell with this damn report. I needed to go home and start googling. And also take a shower, because my face and hands were all sticky. Oh‚Äîand I still smelled like vomit, too. 

I got up and left everything on my desk as it was, including the open document of word salad on my computer screen. Hopefully, my boss would see all that and realize this was an emergency. If not, oh well, whatever. I'll just deal with it on Monday, I thought.

I raced home, taking a different route to avoid having to pass that bakery. I felt like just the sight of it might make me sick again. There had to be something wrong with that donut. I felt totally normal until I met that sugary bitch. Maybe it really was food poisoning. *Fuck*‚Äîthe strawberries! E. coli, duh. *Damn*, should've gotten one of the whores; chocolate would've never betrayed me like that.

Food poisoning didn't exactly explain the sugary sweat, but I was still convinced that's what it was. Maybe I got so sick, I'd started hallucinating? Yeah, that *had* to be it. Ha! That donut wasn't actually thrashing in my stomach. The strawberry chunk wasn't ever moving. And the goopy sweat? Probably just some leftover glaze I didn't realize was there. *Pftt.* I shook my head and chuckled to myself. There was nothing to worry about. It'll pass.

I got home, threw my keys onto the side table, and headed straight for the bathroom. I decided to brush my teeth first. My breath was so rank I couldn't stand it anymore, and the taste of sugar and stomach acid still lingered on my tongue. I brushed the hell out of my entire mouth for at least 2 1/2 minutes, then spit into the sink. When I saw what had come out of my mouth, I almost choked. 

Sprinkles. A bunch of them. God, how did they all get stuck in my teeth like that? How did I not feel them? I cupped my hand under the faucet and rinsed my mouth out a few times. Each time I spit, more came out. It seemed to be an endless supply of them, like there was a God damned sprinkle dispenser somewhere behind my molars. But finally, after the fifth rinse, I ran my tongue across my teeth and didn't feel any more. So, I got into the shower and figured if anything else weird happened, I'd just worry about it then.

Then, something else weird happened.

I turned the hot water on, stepped under the stream, closed my eyes and began running my hands across my skin. My entire body felt tacky and gross. I reached up to find that my hair felt the same way‚Äîit had formed into five or six clumps on the top of my head. *Yuck.* Instantly, I pulled my hand away and opened my eyes to grab the shampoo bottle. That's when I noticed it. 

The water that was dripping from my body was milky white. *What the fuck?* I jumped back from the shower head and looked up. The water coming out of it was clear. I scrunched my eyebrows, then slowly looked back down. The thick, milky drippings had started to collect in a pile, clogging up the drain. 

I tried to slide the clump away with my foot, only to have it spread itself in between my toes, like when you step on a glob of peanut butter. It sent a shiver down my spine, and I started flapping my foot around trying to fling the goop off of it, but it wasn't moving. So, I reached down to dislodge whatever it was by hand. Just then, I was hit with an oddly familiar scent. The same one that had filled the air of that bakery. *Sugar.* 

*Jesus H. Christ*‚Äîdid I try to fuck it?! Just how much icing did I smear on myself? Shit, I must've rubbed that fucking donut all over my body. Hell no, man. I've done some weird shit in my life, but never with food. That thing must've been drugged! 

My hand shot up to my forehead, and my eyes raced back and forth as I desperately tried to remember anything at all from the ten minutes or so I had blacked out. Nothing. Not a damn thing. God, I *had* to have been slipped something. That was the only explanation that made sense.

My heart started pounding and I began to feel woozy. I was obviously under the influence of some type of drug, but I had no idea what. I quickly washed my hair, then grabbed the loofah and started frantically scrubbing my body from the top down. 

When I reached my butt, I used my hand to wash in between my cheeks since the loofah's too rough. I was immediately disgusted to find there were little specks of something buried deep within my ass crack. 

I didn't even need to look‚ÄîI knew what they were. But still, there I was, gawking down at my hand in complete and utter shock nonetheless. Sprinkles. At least a dozen or more. 

I was ashamed and completely disgusted with myself. I couldn't believe I'd actually scratched my ass while eating that donut! Shit, hopefully I waited until after I was finished. But, either way, that meant my fingers were... and then I... Oh, *God.* 

Whatever‚Äînothing I could do about it now. I rinsed the butt sprinkles from my hand, then continued down to my legs. They were dry. Like, *really* dry. I'm talking sandpaper. Large flakes of my skin started to slough off as I scrubbed, plopping onto the shower floor like tiny, wet crepes. 

I've never been good about moisturizing, and to be honest, I usually don't even wash anything below the knees, but today I had to. They must've just been overdue for a good exfoliating, I thought. 

Once I got out and toweled myself off, I noticed my upper body felt waxy and smooth. Too smooth. It was like a slight, buttery layer of film sitting on top of my skin. My bottom half was the opposite. I thought all those skin flakes coming off would've helped, but my legs still looked extremely dry‚Äîalmost scaly. I dropped the towel and reached down with my bare hand. When my fingers touched one of the flaked-off portions of my calf, my heart sank. My skin... it felt *crispy.*

Hell no‚ÄîI am *not* dealing with this right now. I'll just lotion them later if they still feel rough when I sober up. I shook my head, then leaned forward over the sink to look into the mirror. My pupils were enormous, and a fresh coat of glaze covered my face with a lustrous, glossy sheen. 

*Shit... you're tripping balls, man.*

There was nothing I could do but try to wait it out. If I went to the hospital and started explaining my '*symptoms*', I'd be fitted for a brand new pair of grippy socks in a heartbeat. No. There was no need to panic. I just needed to let whatever the hell drug this was wear off. Run its course. Yeah, it's no big deal. It'll be okay.

I thought sleep would be the answer. So, I hurried off to my bedroom and started covering all the windows with dark blankets to block out the midday sun as best I could. I didn't even bother putting clothes back on‚ÄîI figured I'd end up sweating like a pig during this detox anyway. No need to dirty another pair of underwear. 

By the time I'd finished blacking out the room, I was already starting to feel like I was burning up. It was like an oven had suddenly kicked on inside me. I plopped myself down onto the bed, splayed out like a starfish, and waited. 

First, the nausea returned. I had to close my eyes to stop the ceiling from spinning. Then, the heat within me intensified. This fierce burning sensation started to tear through my body, radiating deep from my core. *Oh, God.* It was almost unbearable. I clenched onto the bedsheet underneath me with both fists and tried desperately to control my breathing. A buzzing sensation began to spread through my body, like every cell inside me vibrating all at once. My eyes rolled into the back of my head, and the room went black. 

When I woke up, the slivers of sunlight that had been peering out from the sides of the blankets were gone. My eyes darted over to the little red numbers piercing through the darkness of my room. It was 5:00 AM. *Jesus Christ*, I'd slept the entire rest of the day and all through the night. 

I remained still for a moment, trying to assess my mental and physical state, praying everything had gone back to normal. The nausea had passed, but my body was still burning up. My mouth was unbelievably dry, and the air in my room felt stagnant and heavy. It seemed to push down from above like a weighted blanket‚Äîsmothering me. I forced in a deep breath, and when I did, I noticed the smell. That fucking *smell.*

However, it wasn't until I attempted to reach up and wipe my face that I began to truly realize the horror I'd woken up to. My arm. It wouldn't move‚Äîit was stuck to the bed. The other one, too. And... and my legs. *What the fuck??* My head shot up in a panic, and the pillow came with it.

When I looked down at my body, my jaw dropped open. I was huge. I'm talking gigantic. Bloated, puffy, and round beyond belief. I'd gone from a size 34 pants to at least a 52. Not even joking. It was like I'd gained a hundred pounds overnight. I couldn't believe it. This couldn't be happening. I'd slept almost 20 hours‚Äîthe drug should've worn off!

As I glared down in shock, I could see that my now rotund upper body was caked in a thick, opaque layer of pasty goop. It had dripped and clung to the bed, sticking to the skin of my back and arms like a human glue trap. 

From the waist down, I was surrounded by a large, dark red stain on the sheets. Is that‚Äî? *No. Can't be.* I blinked a few times, then squinted as my eyes strained to adjust. The mystery red liquid had dried to a crust at the edges, forming a giant congealed mass beneath me. 

I struggled to lift myself up further, forcing my neck forward as hard as I could. Then, I gave myself one good push. As my body squished against itself, more of the thick red goo suddenly appeared... oozing‚Ä¶ from my fucking belly button.

The secretion slowly slid from the side of my stomach into the pile below, landing with a wet *plap.* Instinct took over, and I started to thrash and writhe against the bed, desperate to free myself from this disgusting, sticky goop from hell. 

Peeling my top half from the sheets felt like ripping off a massive band-aid. Thick white strings clung to me as the gummy substance stretched and pulled at my skin, trying to force me back down. I bit down hard on my bottom lip and just went for it. I'll admit it‚ÄîI screamed. Screamed like a bitch. 

Once my arms were free, I moved on to my legs. The red stuff was worse. Much thicker, less give. It was agonizing. Huge, crispy strips of flesh tore from my legs, remaining glued to the clotted red mess that had leaked from my unrecognizably grotesque body. After I'd completely broken free from my adhesive prison, I hobbled to the bathroom, dripping the entire way. 

I stared at myself in the mirror, my gargantuan, sugar-slathered body shaking uncontrollably. *Fuck*. I shouldn't have just gone to sleep. I should have dealt with this when I had the chance. That donut wasn't drugged, it was cursed. Something in it. A demon‚Äîpossessing me. Changing me. It had hollowed me out and was growing inside me.

I collapsed onto the cold floor and buried my face in my hands as I began to cry. Not tears, of course. Instead of droplets of wetness, I felt little taps of grit. I ripped my hands away from my eyes. 

Sprinkles. Rainbow fucking sprinkles. 

An animalistic shriek erupted from my lungs, and I hurled them across the room. They hit the wall with a *ping*, scattering all over the floor like confetti at my funeral. Mocking me. 

I pulled myself back up to my feet, limped over to the shower, and got in. I scrubbed, wincing in pain as the loofah scraped against my raw skin. To distract myself, I started trying to weigh my options. I couldn't ignore this anymore. I knew I needed help, desperately. I just didn't know who to turn to. Shit, doctors wouldn't know what to do with me at this point‚Äîwhatever was happening to me had very quickly devolved into something modern medicine couldn't do shit about. 

I thought about calling my cousin, Sonia, in Maine. Her husband had gone through some weird body shit recently. Maybe she'd know what to do. She'd been vague about the details of what happened to him when she told me about it a few months ago. Something about fish? What I did remember was she had been very clear about one thing: it didn't end well. 

Scratch that. If she couldn't help him, she definitely couldn't help me either. I gripped the loofah tighter, my body trembling from the pain and fear. I had to do something. I couldn't allow myself to crumble under the weight of my insane circumstance. I refused to let this *thing* take over. 

I shuffled out of the tub, almost slipping on the pink sludge I'd left behind as I lifted my massive, jiggly leg over the side. I carefully dried myself off, soaking up the leftover glaze from my creases. Then, I shakily began trying to bandage up the gaping wounds on my legs.

They were oozing the same shit that had come out of my belly button. I set a piece of gauze down on top of one of the rips in my flesh, and the redness seeped through instantly. It wasn't blood. Deep down, I already knew that. Still, I reached down, scooped up a dollop with my fingers, and sniffed it. *Strawberry.*

Whatever the fuck was happening to me, I was powerless to stop it alone. There was only one thing left I could do. So, I threw a blanket over my half-glazed naked body, since none of my clothes fit anymore, then scuttled out to my car and began tearing down the street‚Äîheaded toward that fucking bakery.

The door slammed against the wall with a loud bang as I busted through. The stupid little bell dislodged and went sliding across the floor. The place was empty, except for the lady behind the counter. She looked up at me and smiled. 

""Welcome back! Did you enjoy your donut, sir?""

I just stood there in the doorway for a moment, completely dumbfounded, as her smile widened into a sinister, toothy grin. Did I *enjoy* the donut? The sheer audacity of this woman. There I was, shaped like a fucking eclair, covered in only a blanket and dripping red goop everywhere. I sure as shit did not.¬† A fiery rage began to simmer within me. And then, I exploded.

*""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO THAT DONUT?!?!‚Äù*

She laughed. 

""Why, nothing, sir. Nothing at all.""

""Bullshit! What the fuck is happening to me?!"" I demanded. 

""Exactly what was meant to happen,"" she answered. 

""You cursed it! *Christ,* I fucking knew it!! What is this, huh? Some kinda donut voodoo shop?!""

She shook her head and chuckled dismissively.¬† 

""Sir, I just sell the donuts. I don't make them."" 

I stormed up to the counter and threw the sticky blanket down onto the ground, revealing the gruesome form I was now trapped inside of.  

""I don't give a shit who makes them! I want to know why the hell this is happening to my body!!"" 

""Isn't it obvious?"" she giggled. ""You are what you eat."" 

I slammed my fist down onto the counter.

""I want to see your fucking manager, NOW!""

""Of course, sir. Right this way.""

She calmly stepped away from the register and gestured for me to follow her to the back of the bakery. I stomped down the long, sterile, white hallway as she casually led the way, glancing over her shoulder every so often with a smirk. I didn't know what I was going to say when I got to wherever we were going, but I needed answers‚Äîand this bitch apparently wasn't going to tell me jack shit. 

We reached a large door at the end of the hall with a sign that said '*MDI*' in big, bold, red letters. It was fitted with a padlock and a keypad near the handle. The lady pulled out a set of keys and fiddled with them while I waited impatiently. Finally, she opened the lock, unlatched the door, then hovered over the keypad as she punched the numbers in. A loud beep pierced through the silence, and the door slowly squealed open. 

Inside that room was the most incomprehensible horror I could've ever dared to imagine. A being so grotesque‚Äîso shocking. It froze me in place as I struggled to make sense of the unholy sight before me. 

It filled the entire room. Not only in size, but in presence. It felt ancient. And powerful. Something beyond this world... this universe. I was in awe, and yet, overwhelmed with revulsion at what I was forced to behold.

Thick, pulsating lines of bulging, red jelly snaked around doughy coils of glossy, beige flesh like veins. Layers of soured pink icing dripped from beneath a heap of encrusted rainbow sprinkles embedded firmly atop its hideous, glistening mass. This sickeningly enormous body made of sugar, fried dough, and strawberry-flavored goop terrified me to my absolute core. 

It had no eyes‚Äîjust mouths. Dozens upon dozens of perfectly round gaping holes stretched across the front of it, each filled with rows of tiny, sharp, crystalline teeth that sparkled under the heat lamps above. 

And, it breathed. The coils slowly lifted and fell like folds in a stomach, as gurgling globs of chunky red viscera sputtered from the center. Steam radiated from its crispy posterior. Each time it shifted, the smell of sugar and yeast filled the air. Suffocatingly sweet and warm with rot. 

Suddenly, the door slammed shut behind me. I tore my eyes away from the monstrosity to look at the counter lady, who was now standing in front of the door, blocking my only way out. 

""*What the fuck is that?*"" I uttered with wide eyes. 

She narrowed her gaze, and the smile dropped from her face.

""Mother Donut calls to us all... and we answer."" 

I turned to look back at the oozing, demonic atrocity. 

""*This?* This is what I'm turning into?!"" 

""No, don't be ridiculous,"" she said. ""This is what created you. And those who came before you. Go on‚Äîspeak to her. Ask your questions."" 

I gulped hard as I looked up at this sugary mammoth towering over me, then finally mustered up the courage to ask, 

""What's happening to me? What... *am* I?""

The plethora of holes began to move in unison as the bellowing growl of a hundred voices emitted from the effulgent mass at once. 

""You are my offspring. My sweet creation. And from within you, my seed shall spread.""

Blackness crept in from the corners of my vision as I zeroed in on this ungodly creature. I was no longer afraid. I was furious. I'd been infected with some sort of parasitic donut spawn? And for what‚Äîall because I just wanted to enjoy my cheat day? What kind of horse shit is that?? It wasn't fair... I deserved a treat!

""No, the fuck it will not!"" I screamed. ""You better undo this shit right now! Fix me back like I was or..."" 

My voice began to crack with desperation. 

""Or, I'll fucking kill you!! I didn't sign up for this shit, man! It... it was just a God damned donut!""

Giant, red bubbles suddenly spewed from her center mass like lava from a volcano. They popped and splattered my face with piping hot, rotten jelly as a guttural laugh vibrated from the mouths. 

""It cannot be undone,"" she said. ""The transformation is nearly complete, my child."" 

""Please... *oh, God*... no!"" I begged. ""I don't deserve this!!""

She growled. 

""You chose this. You agreed to it. The terms of purchase were stated clearly on the receipt you left behind on the counter without a glance."" 

The room went dead silent. I was too late. Too stupid. Too fucking self-indulgent and careless to prevent my own demise. There was nothing I could do‚Äînothing left to say. It was time to deal with this. Time to face the facts. I was fucked. 

Sprinkles began to trickle down my face. The oven inside me suddenly shot up to 350 degrees. I bolted towards her‚Äîfull speed, fists wailing. If I was going down, this bitch was coming with me. 

Just before I reached her, I felt a sudden, sharp pain in the back of my head. I fell backward, and my body hit the ground instantly with a massive thud. I looked up and saw the counter lady standing over me, now blurry, and holding a rolling pin. Then... darkness, and the faint echo of a wet, bubbling laugh. 

When I awoke, I couldn't move, but I could see. My eyes darted all around. I was no longer in the lair of the beast. Instead, I was in a white room, surrounded by a warm, fuzzy, bright light. Everything looked soft and inviting. Placid. Peaceful. Perfect. I thought I had died. I thought maybe I was in heaven. I couldn't have been more wrong. 

*BAM!!!!!*

A giant fingertip slammed down from above, pressing hard against some sort of invisible forcefield around me. It was... it was *glass*. I was under a fucking glass dome‚Äîlying next to a chocolate whore. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. Panic surged through my jelly-filled veins.

I was paralyzed. Powerless. Positively petrified. My strawberry heart thrashed hard against my pink-slathered, rainbow-sprinkled chest as a booming voice rattled the tray beneath me. 

It said,

1mugypz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mugypz/the_donut_that_never_left/,The Donut That Never Left,"Jelly-filled. Pink icing and rainbow sprinkles delicately blanketed the top of its exquisite, glistening mass. This delightfully devious little body made of sugar, fried dough, and strawberry-flavored goop tempted me to the point of no return. I pressed the tip of my index finger against the glass and said,

""This one.""

I knew I shouldn't have. But I'd been so good lately. I deserved a treat. And besides, I'd make up for it at the gym later, then pound a fuck-ton of water and flush that bitch right out. Yeah, it's no big deal. It's Friday: cheat day. And this week's been hell. I *needed* this.

""That'll be $1.99, sir.""

The lady at the counter smiled and handed me the bulging bag. I held it close, pressing its warm weight against my chest. My mouth pooled with saliva as I slid her my debit card. 

""Anything else?""

I glanced back toward the glass dome filled with plump pastries, then shook my head. They all looked like whores, slathered in chocolate and cheaply seductive‚Äîno substance. Nope, I had everything I needed right here in this greasy white paper bag. *Mine* had fruit. She handed my card back over and said, 

""Have a nice day!""

I grinned, looking down at the bag cradled in my arms. I sure as shit will, I thought. Then, I hurried back to my car to devour this goddess of a donut in seclusion. I needed privacy; this was a moment to be savored. Carefully, I eased my hand into the bag's opening until the tips of my fingers met her soft, pillowy posterior. Once I'd gripped onto the end, I gently pulled to reveal divine perfection. 

The icing lay undisturbed; every single sprinkle had held on. It didn't feel right to just go in at it. No, it was too beautiful to be ravaged like that. It begged to be adored and cherished‚Äîworshiped. I couldn't just bite into this donut like some sort of monster. The jelly would spill out all over, and I didn't have any napkins. 
 
I held it up to my face, admiring the flawless sheen of its glaze in the soft morning light. I inhaled deeply, slowly taking in the heavenly scent that filled me with euphoria. Then, I slid my tongue gently across the surface of its sweet, crispy skin. And that's where it all began. This simple little act of mindless self-indulgence would later become the single biggest regret of my life.

Yet, a smile crept across my face as the intense warmth of this magnificent exterior overwhelmed me. I had one thought, and one thought only: I needed to get to what was inside. Slowly, I sank my teeth deep into its sugary flesh, carefully removing the tiniest of morsels and releasing a floodgate of warm, red jelly. I let the intoxicating, chunky viscus pour into my mouth and surrendered to the ecstasy. 

After that, I blacked out.

When I came to, I'd devoured the whole thing. Not a trace of it remained; even my fingers had been licked clean and sucked dry. I searched the bag, hoping there might be a tiny smidge of icing left behind, but nothing. Not even a sprinkle. It was all gone. *Shit,* I don't even get to keep the memory of enjoying it? Why did I scarf it down so quickly? 

The only evidence that I'd even done so was the lump pressing hard at the back of my throat as the last bite of my breakfast made its way down my esophagus and onto the gullet. Guess I need to work on that whole *'self-control'* thing.

As I drove to work in my sugared-up intoxication, the lump began to squirm. Must be a burp trying to come out, I thought; probably swallowed a fuck ton of air during my binge-fit. I slammed my fist against my chest, but it didn't help. Instead, I could feel my throat tightening around the bulge, trying to push it down. No‚Äîthe opposite. It felt like that hunk of donut was forcing its way down, in spite of my body trying to stop it. What the fuck. 

My eyes watered as I began to cough, choking on the wad of dough that had now firmly planted itself just above my sternum. The bitch wasn't moving at all. I struggled to keep my eyes on the road as I frantically searched the floor of my passenger seat for a half-empty bottle of water. Finally, I laid my hand on one, leaned my head back, and chugged. 

Down she went, without a fight. I smiled and threw the empty bottle back down onto the floor where it belonged. Then, I took a deep breath of relief. *God,* how stupid would it have been if I'd choked to death on a fucking donut? Embarrassing. I wiped my eyes and continued down the road. 

By the time I got to work, the donut had reached my stomach, landing like a boulder dropped off a cliff. I ran to the bathroom, thinking I had to take a shit. I sat in that stall straining for at least 10 minutes, but nothing came out. So, I stood up and pulled my pants back on. Then, I turned around and looked at the toilet. I froze. There, floating in the water, was a single blue sprinkle.

My eyes widened, and I blinked a few times. Then, I leaned forward to make sure I was really seeing what I thought I was. Yep‚Äîa sprinkle. Not a poop-sized one. A regular one. My body snapped upright. No fucking way that came out of my butt. It had to have been on my pants. I just didn't notice. Yeah, of course, that's what it was.

I walked from the bathroom laughing at myself for getting freaked out, even momentarily. My stomach was still killing me, though. The damn donut was sloshing around in the water I'd chugged like a ship caught in a storm. With each step I took, I could feel it rocking back and forth. 

*Gurgle, gurgle. Slosh, slosh.*

When I got to my desk, I started searching around in all the drawers for a roll of Tums. I got excited for a second, until I realized it was just the empty wrapper I'd left myself to be fooled by later. Past me is such an asshole. 

*Gurrrrrp!*

""Shut up.""

Fuck. I had to do something, and quickly. My stomach was visibly rippling at that point, and I could barely stay seated. I thought about undoing my belt, but I didn't want to get accused of being a pervert. Especially not after I accidentally elbowed Sharon from accounting in the boob last week. That was her fault for crowding me at the coffee pot, though. Unfortunately, HR didn't see it that way.

Wait‚Äîcoffee! That'll make me shit, I thought. Even though my stomach was past maximum capacity, it seemed like my only option. Besides, a shot of black coffee to the gut might just actually do the trick to move this mass along. The bitch had already overstayed her welcome. It was time for an eviction notice. 

I hurried to the break room to find Sharon at the coffee pot. *Of course.* I kept my distance as we silently exchanged awkward glances. I didn't want to look her in the eye, so I stared at the coffee pot in her hands instead. I was so uncomfortable. I could barely keep still as my gurgles and groans echoed through the otherwise empty room. She cut her pour short, grabbed a handful of Sweet'N Low packets, then rushed out of the door while covering her nose. *Pftt*‚Äîprobably thought I was farting. Believe me, lady. I wish I *could* fart.

I poured a splash and a half into my cup and threw it back, still scalding. It burned all the way down, but I didn't care. The pain in my throat was a welcome distraction from the mayhem that was going on in my stomach. The roof of my mouth was going to be fucked for a day or two. But, I figured, if it worked, it would all be worth it. After all, this was my last-ditch effort to be able to make it through the rest of my workday. 

It also turned out to be a big mistake.

The searing black liquid landed with an eruption. I immediately doubled over in the worst pain I'd ever felt in my life. The wad of sugary dough had begun to thrash violently, slamming itself against the walls of my stomach. No, I'm not fucking joking. I could feel it. Not just in my stomach‚Äîwith my hands, too. I literally felt this donut pounding from the inside out, lifting my skin as it pushed against its gastric prison. 

I ran full speed to the bathroom, praying I'd make it there before I passed out, vomited, or shit my pants. Or, all three. My belly bounced as I ran, suddenly swollen like a puppy with worms. I thought I was bloated before, but now I was literally about to pop. The movement made the pain infinitely worse, but I had no choice. Fuck this. It had to come out.

The stall door slammed against the wall, and I fell to my knees, gripping the toilet in preparation. My face was ice-cold and clammy. Warm saliva flooded my mouth. Yes! Come out! Be gone, bitch! 

*GUUURRRPPP*

I began to heave and spit into the toilet. The mass was so close I could taste it, but nothing was coming out. It was fighting me. I shoved my finger down into my throat, scraping against the burnt roof of my mouth. I winced from the pain, and my eyes started watering uncontrollably. A few gags, and up she came. 

A putrid flurry of pink sludge spewed from my mouth, swirled with a deep, crimson red foam. It splattered back up into my face when it hit the toilet at lightning speed. Fuck, so much came out of me, I can't even explain it. But that was only phase one. Next came the chunks. 

By the time I was done, I thought I was going to lose consciousness. The room was spinning, and I struggled to catch my breath, so I lowered myself onto the floor, still hugging the toilet. 

I couldn't help but inspect this ungodly force that had just come out of me. Slowly, I lifted my head and peeked over the seat. *Holy fuck.* I gazed down at the thick pink vomit in utter shock and disgust. Shit, it looked like I'd barely even chewed this donut. Even the rainbow sprinkles had all remained whole, floating around in the sludge like tiny specks of whimsy in a cotton candy-colored massacre. Surrounding them were a few large globs of fleshy beige, accompanied by several smaller red clumps. *Christ.* I just *had* to get the one with fruit, huh?

Suddenly, my eyes fixed on the largest red chunk floating in the middle of the sludge. It looked different than the other ones. Shaped weird. And it was... *moving?* I wiped my eyes. Yes‚Äîit was fucking moving! Convulsing. Constricting. Sputtering red goop from both ends. *No fucking way.*

I stood up so fast, I nearly fell backwards out of the stall. Black spots began to appear in my line of vision. I gripped onto the threshold with both hands as I swayed, trying to regain balance. I held my breath and slowly leaned forward to look again. It stopped.

Oh, thank God. It *wasn't* moving. Get it together, bro. It's just a chunk of strawberry; how could it be moving? I almost wanted to poke at it, but considering how vile the mess I'd made in the toilet was, I resisted that urge.

The hinges of the bathroom door creaked, and footsteps began to approach. I quickly reached over and flushed the rainbow sprinkled slurry. It smelled like death‚Äîsickly sweet with a hint of berry. I desperately tried to fan the stink away with one hand while wiping my face with the other.

When I exited the stall, Jerry from sales was at the urinal. He turned to look at me as I approached the sink, visibly disgusted by the pungent odor that had completely filled the room at that point.  

""Gnarly case of food poisoning,"" I told him. 

He nodded, then focused his eyes back in front of him. With a splash of water and a squirt of soap, I quickly washed my hands and ran out of there. On the way back to my desk, I bumped into my boss, who promptly asked what the hell I'd been doing all morning. 

""Sorry, sir. I think I'm coming down with something.""

He folded his arms in front of him and scrunched his eyebrows. 

""That's the excuse you're going with this time?""

""Ask Jerry, he'll tell you. I was just in the bathroom. If you want proof, go in there and take a big whiff."" 

""Alright, that's enough,"" he said. ""Just make sure that report is on my desk before lunch, then you can leave if you need to. And don't forget, you're still on disciplinary probation after last week.""

""Yes, sir.""

Fuck. I forgot all about that damn report. I hadn't even started it yet, and it was almost 10:00. At least my stomach was starting to feel better. My abs were sore from all the heaving, but now that just meant I could skip the gym later. I'd already puked up the donut anyway, so the carbs didn't count. 

Shit, what a weird ass morning I was having‚Äîalmost got killed by a donut twice. What an evil bitch! She tempted me, then tortured me. Well, lesson learned. Not going back to that bakery again. At least now she was gone, and it was over. 

I sat down at my desk, opened up a Word document, and began typing nonsense. My thoughts were all jumbled up, and my head was throbbing from straining so hard. I kept having to retype each sentence over and over until it made sense. Before I knew it, another hour had gone by, and I was sweating. 

My hand reached up to wipe away the droplets accumulating on the ridge of my brow. Right away, I noticed something weird. My sweat was thick. Like... *goop.* I slowly pulled my hand away in confusion to look at the substance that had just excreted from my pores. 

It was clear, like sweat's supposed to be. But there was a ton of it. And it didn't drip. No‚Äîinstead, it gathered in a rounded clump at the edge of my fingertips. Then, I pressed my fingers together. It was sticky, too. *Oh, god.* I slowly raised my hand up to my lips and tasted. It was fucking *sugar.*

Okay... something weird is definitely going on. What the fuck was in that donut?! I had to leave work. Immediately. To hell with this damn report. I needed to go home and start googling. And also take a shower, because my face and hands were all sticky. Oh‚Äîand I still smelled like vomit, too. 

I got up and left everything on my desk as it was, including the open document of word salad on my computer screen. Hopefully, my boss would see all that and realize this was an emergency. If not, oh well, whatever. I'll just deal with it on Monday, I thought.

I raced home, taking a different route to avoid having to pass that bakery. I felt like just the sight of it might make me sick again. There had to be something wrong with that donut. I felt totally normal until I met that sugary bitch. Maybe it really was food poisoning. *Fuck*‚Äîthe strawberries! E. coli, duh. *Damn*, should've gotten one of the whores; chocolate would've never betrayed me like that.

Food poisoning didn't exactly explain the sugary sweat, but I was still convinced that's what it was. Maybe I got so sick, I'd started hallucinating? Yeah, that *had* to be it. Ha! That donut wasn't actually thrashing in my stomach. The strawberry chunk wasn't ever moving. And the goopy sweat? Probably just some leftover glaze I didn't realize was there. *Pftt.* I shook my head and chuckled to myself. There was nothing to worry about. It'll pass.

I got home, threw my keys onto the side table, and headed straight for the bathroom. I decided to brush my teeth first. My breath was so rank I couldn't stand it anymore, and the taste of sugar and stomach acid still lingered on my tongue. I brushed the hell out of my entire mouth for at least 2 1/2 minutes, then spit into the sink. When I saw what had come out of my mouth, I almost choked. 

Sprinkles. A bunch of them. God, how did they all get stuck in my teeth like that? How did I not feel them? I cupped my hand under the faucet and rinsed my mouth out a few times. Each time I spit, more came out. It seemed to be an endless supply of them, like there was a God damned sprinkle dispenser somewhere behind my molars. But finally, after the fifth rinse, I ran my tongue across my teeth and didn't feel any more. So, I got into the shower and figured if anything else weird happened, I'd just worry about it then.

Then, something else weird happened.

I turned the hot water on, stepped under the stream, closed my eyes and began running my hands across my skin. My entire body felt tacky and gross. I reached up to find that my hair felt the same way‚Äîit had formed into five or six clumps on the top of my head. *Yuck.* Instantly, I pulled my hand away and opened my eyes to grab the shampoo bottle. That's when I noticed it. 

The water that was dripping from my body was milky white. *What the fuck?* I jumped back from the shower head and looked up. The water coming out of it was clear. I scrunched my eyebrows, then slowly looked back down. The thick, milky drippings had started to collect in a pile, clogging up the drain. 

I tried to slide the clump away with my foot, only to have it spread itself in between my toes, like when you step on a glob of peanut butter. It sent a shiver down my spine, and I started flapping my foot around trying to fling the goop off of it, but it wasn't moving. So, I reached down to dislodge whatever it was by hand. Just then, I was hit with an oddly familiar scent. The same one that had filled the air of that bakery. *Sugar.* 

*Jesus H. Christ*‚Äîdid I try to fuck it?! Just how much icing did I smear on myself? Shit, I must've rubbed that fucking donut all over my body. Hell no, man. I've done some weird shit in my life, but never with food. That thing must've been drugged! 

My hand shot up to my forehead, and my eyes raced back and forth as I desperately tried to remember anything at all from the ten minutes or so I had blacked out. Nothing. Not a damn thing. God, I *had* to have been slipped something. That was the only explanation that made sense.

My heart started pounding and I began to feel woozy. I was obviously under the influence of some type of drug, but I had no idea what. I quickly washed my hair, then grabbed the loofah and started frantically scrubbing my body from the top down. 

When I reached my butt, I used my hand to wash in between my cheeks since the loofah's too rough. I was immediately disgusted to find there were little specks of something buried deep within my ass crack. 

I didn't even need to look‚ÄîI knew what they were. But still, there I was, gawking down at my hand in complete and utter shock nonetheless. Sprinkles. At least a dozen or more. 

I was ashamed and completely disgusted with myself. I couldn't believe I'd actually scratched my ass while eating that donut! Shit, hopefully I waited until after I was finished. But, either way, that meant my fingers were... and then I... Oh, *God.* 

Whatever‚Äînothing I could do about it now. I rinsed the butt sprinkles from my hand, then continued down to my legs. They were dry. Like, *really* dry. I'm talking sandpaper. Large flakes of my skin started to slough off as I scrubbed, plopping onto the shower floor like tiny, wet crepes. 

I've never been good about moisturizing, and to be honest, I usually don't even wash anything below the knees, but today I had to. They must've just been overdue for a good exfoliating, I thought. 

Once I got out and toweled myself off, I noticed my upper body felt waxy and smooth. Too smooth. It was like a slight, buttery layer of film sitting on top of my skin. My bottom half was the opposite. I thought all those skin flakes coming off would've helped, but my legs still looked extremely dry‚Äîalmost scaly. I dropped the towel and reached down with my bare hand. When my fingers touched one of the flaked-off portions of my calf, my heart sank. My skin... it felt *crispy.*

Hell no‚ÄîI am *not* dealing with this right now. I'll just lotion them later if they still feel rough when I sober up. I shook my head, then leaned forward over the sink to look into the mirror. My pupils were enormous, and a fresh coat of glaze covered my face with a lustrous, glossy sheen. 

*Shit... you're tripping balls, man.*

There was nothing I could do but try to wait it out. If I went to the hospital and started explaining my '*symptoms*', I'd be fitted for a brand new pair of grippy socks in a heartbeat. No. There was no need to panic. I just needed to let whatever the hell drug this was wear off. Run its course. Yeah, it's no big deal. It'll be okay.

I thought sleep would be the answer. So, I hurried off to my bedroom and started covering all the windows with dark blankets to block out the midday sun as best I could. I didn't even bother putting clothes back on‚ÄîI figured I'd end up sweating like a pig during this detox anyway. No need to dirty another pair of underwear. 

By the time I'd finished blacking out the room, I was already starting to feel like I was burning up. It was like an oven had suddenly kicked on inside me. I plopped myself down onto the bed, splayed out like a starfish, and waited. 

First, the nausea returned. I had to close my eyes to stop the ceiling from spinning. Then, the heat within me intensified. This fierce burning sensation started to tear through my body, radiating deep from my core. *Oh, God.* It was almost unbearable. I clenched onto the bedsheet underneath me with both fists and tried desperately to control my breathing. A buzzing sensation began to spread through my body, like every cell inside me vibrating all at once. My eyes rolled into the back of my head, and the room went black. 

When I woke up, the slivers of sunlight that had been peering out from the sides of the blankets were gone. My eyes darted over to the little red numbers piercing through the darkness of my room. It was 5:00 AM. *Jesus Christ*, I'd slept the entire rest of the day and all through the night. 

I remained still for a moment, trying to assess my mental and physical state, praying everything had gone back to normal. The nausea had passed, but my body was still burning up. My mouth was unbelievably dry, and the air in my room felt stagnant and heavy. It seemed to push down from above like a weighted blanket‚Äîsmothering me. I forced in a deep breath, and when I did, I noticed the smell. That fucking *smell.*

However, it wasn't until I attempted to reach up and wipe my face that I began to truly realize the horror I'd woken up to. My arm. It wouldn't move‚Äîit was stuck to the bed. The other one, too. And... and my legs. *What the fuck??* My head shot up in a panic, and the pillow came with it.

When I looked down at my body, my jaw dropped open. I was huge. I'm talking gigantic. Bloated, puffy, and round beyond belief. I'd gone from a size 34 pants to at least a 52. Not even joking. It was like I'd gained a hundred pounds overnight. I couldn't believe it. This couldn't be happening. I'd slept almost 20 hours‚Äîthe drug should've worn off!

As I glared down in shock, I could see that my now rotund upper body was caked in a thick, opaque layer of pasty goop. It had dripped and clung to the bed, sticking to the skin of my back and arms like a human glue trap. 

From the waist down, I was surrounded by a large, dark red stain on the sheets. Is that‚Äî? *No. Can't be.* I blinked a few times, then squinted as my eyes strained to adjust. The mystery red liquid had dried to a crust at the edges, forming a giant congealed mass beneath me. 

I struggled to lift myself up further, forcing my neck forward as hard as I could. Then, I gave myself one good push. As my body squished against itself, more of the thick red goo suddenly appeared... oozing‚Ä¶ from my fucking belly button.

The secretion slowly slid from the side of my stomach into the pile below, landing with a wet *plap.* Instinct took over, and I started to thrash and writhe against the bed, desperate to free myself from this disgusting, sticky goop from hell. 

Peeling my top half from the sheets felt like ripping off a massive band-aid. Thick white strings clung to me as the gummy substance stretched and pulled at my skin, trying to force me back down. I bit down hard on my bottom lip and just went for it. I'll admit it‚ÄîI screamed. Screamed like a bitch. 

Once my arms were free, I moved on to my legs. The red stuff was worse. Much thicker, less give. It was agonizing. Huge, crispy strips of flesh tore from my legs, remaining glued to the clotted red mess that had leaked from my unrecognizably grotesque body. After I'd completely broken free from my adhesive prison, I hobbled to the bathroom, dripping the entire way. 

I stared at myself in the mirror, my gargantuan, sugar-slathered body shaking uncontrollably. *Fuck*. I shouldn't have just gone to sleep. I should have dealt with this when I had the chance. That donut wasn't drugged, it was cursed. Something in it. A demon‚Äîpossessing me. Changing me. It had hollowed me out and was growing inside me.

I collapsed onto the cold floor and buried my face in my hands as I began to cry. Not tears, of course. Instead of droplets of wetness, I felt little taps of grit. I ripped my hands away from my eyes. 

Sprinkles. Rainbow fucking sprinkles. 

An animalistic shriek erupted from my lungs, and I hurled them across the room. They hit the wall with a *ping*, scattering all over the floor like confetti at my funeral. Mocking me. 

I pulled myself back up to my feet, limped over to the shower, and got in. I scrubbed, wincing in pain as the loofah scraped against my raw skin. To distract myself, I started trying to weigh my options. I couldn't ignore this anymore. I knew I needed help, desperately. I just didn't know who to turn to. Shit, doctors wouldn't know what to do with me at this point‚Äîwhatever was happening to me had very quickly devolved into something modern medicine couldn't do shit about. 

I thought about calling my cousin, Sonia, in Maine. Her husband had gone through some weird body shit recently. Maybe she'd know what to do. She'd been vague about the details of what happened to him when she told me about it a few months ago. Something about fish? What I did remember was she had been very clear about one thing: it didn't end well. 

Scratch that. If she couldn't help him, she definitely couldn't help me either. I gripped the loofah tighter, my body trembling from the pain and fear. I had to do something. I couldn't allow myself to crumble under the weight of my insane circumstance. I refused to let this *thing* take over. 

I shuffled out of the tub, almost slipping on the pink sludge I'd left behind as I lifted my massive, jiggly leg over the side. I carefully dried myself off, soaking up the leftover glaze from my creases. Then, I shakily began trying to bandage up the gaping wounds on my legs.

They were oozing the same shit that had come out of my belly button. I set a piece of gauze down on top of one of the rips in my flesh, and the redness seeped through instantly. It wasn't blood. Deep down, I already knew that. Still, I reached down, scooped up a dollop with my fingers, and sniffed it. *Strawberry.*

Whatever the fuck was happening to me, I was powerless to stop it alone. There was only one thing left I could do. So, I threw a blanket over my half-glazed naked body, since none of my clothes fit anymore, then scuttled out to my car and began tearing down the street‚Äîheaded toward that fucking bakery.

The door slammed against the wall with a loud bang as I busted through. The stupid little bell dislodged and went sliding across the floor. The place was empty, except for the lady behind the counter. She looked up at me and smiled. 

""Welcome back! Did you enjoy your donut, sir?""

I just stood there in the doorway for a moment, completely dumbfounded, as her smile widened into a sinister, toothy grin. Did I *enjoy* the donut? The sheer audacity of this woman. There I was, shaped like a fucking eclair, covered in only a blanket and dripping red goop everywhere. I sure as shit did not.¬† A fiery rage began to simmer within me. And then, I exploded.

*""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO THAT DONUT?!?!‚Äù*

She laughed. 

""Why, nothing, sir. Nothing at all.""

""Bullshit! What the fuck is happening to me?!"" I demanded. 

""Exactly what was meant to happen,"" she answered. 

""You cursed it! *Christ,* I fucking knew it!! What is this, huh? Some kinda donut voodoo shop?!""

She shook her head and chuckled dismissively.¬† 

""Sir, I just sell the donuts. I don't make them."" 

I stormed up to the counter and threw the sticky blanket down onto the ground, revealing the gruesome form I was now trapped inside of.  

""I don't give a shit who makes them! I want to know why the hell this is happening to my body!!"" 

""Isn't it obvious?"" she giggled. ""You are what you eat."" 

I slammed my fist down onto the counter.

""I want to see your fucking manager, NOW!""

""Of course, sir. Right this way.""

She calmly stepped away from the register and gestured for me to follow her to the back of the bakery. I stomped down the long, sterile, white hallway as she casually led the way, glancing over her shoulder every so often with a smirk. I didn't know what I was going to say when I got to wherever we were going, but I needed answers‚Äîand this bitch apparently wasn't going to tell me jack shit. 

We reached a large door at the end of the hall with a sign that said '*MDI*' in big, bold, red letters. It was fitted with a padlock and a keypad near the handle. The lady pulled out a set of keys and fiddled with them while I waited impatiently. Finally, she opened the lock, unlatched the door, then hovered over the keypad as she punched the numbers in. A loud beep pierced through the silence, and the door slowly squealed open. 

Inside that room was the most incomprehensible horror I could've ever dared to imagine. A being so grotesque‚Äîso shocking. It froze me in place as I struggled to make sense of the unholy sight before me. 

It filled the entire room. Not only in size, but in presence. It felt ancient. And powerful. Something beyond this world... this universe. I was in awe, and yet, overwhelmed with revulsion at what I was forced to behold.

Thick, pulsating lines of bulging, red jelly snaked around doughy coils of glossy, beige flesh like veins. Layers of soured pink icing dripped from beneath a heap of encrusted rainbow sprinkles embedded firmly atop its hideous, glistening mass. This sickeningly enormous body made of sugar, fried dough, and strawberry-flavored goop terrified me to my absolute core. 

It had no eyes‚Äîjust mouths. Dozens upon dozens of perfectly round gaping holes stretched across the front of it, each filled with rows of tiny, sharp, crystalline teeth that sparkled under the heat lamps above. 

And, it breathed. The coils slowly lifted and fell like folds in a stomach, as gurgling globs of chunky red viscera sputtered from the center. Steam radiated from its crispy posterior. Each time it shifted, the smell of sugar and yeast filled the air. Suffocatingly sweet and warm with rot. 

Suddenly, the door slammed shut behind me. I tore my eyes away from the monstrosity to look at the counter lady, who was now standing in front of the door, blocking my only way out. 

""*What the fuck is that?*"" I uttered with wide eyes. 

She narrowed her gaze, and the smile dropped from her face.

""Mother Donut calls to us all... and we answer."" 

I turned to look back at the oozing, demonic atrocity. 

""*This?* This is what I'm turning into?!"" 

""No, don't be ridiculous,"" she said. ""This is what created you. And those who came before you. Go on‚Äîspeak to her. Ask your questions."" 

I gulped hard as I looked up at this sugary mammoth towering over me, then finally mustered up the courage to ask, 

""What's happening to me? What... *am* I?""

The plethora of holes began to move in unison as the bellowing growl of a hundred voices emitted from the effulgent mass at once. 

""You are my offspring. My sweet creation. And from within you, my seed shall spread.""

Blackness crept in from the corners of my vision as I zeroed in on this ungodly creature. I was no longer afraid. I was furious. I'd been infected with some sort of parasitic donut spawn? And for what‚Äîall because I just wanted to enjoy my cheat day? What kind of horse shit is that?? It wasn't fair... I deserved a treat!

""No, the fuck it will not!"" I screamed. ""You better undo this shit right now! Fix me back like I was or..."" 

My voice began to crack with desperation. 

""Or, I'll fucking kill you!! I didn't sign up for this shit, man! It... it was just a God damned donut!""

Giant, red bubbles suddenly spewed from her center mass like lava from a volcano. They popped and splattered my face with piping hot, rotten jelly as a guttural laugh vibrated from the mouths. 

""It cannot be undone,"" she said. ""The transformation is nearly complete, my child."" 

""Please... *oh, God*... no!"" I begged. ""I don't deserve this!!""

She growled. 

""You chose this. You agreed to it. The terms of purchase were stated clearly on the receipt you left behind on the counter without a glance."" 

The room went dead silent. I was too late. Too stupid. Too fucking self-indulgent and careless to prevent my own demise. There was nothing I could do‚Äînothing left to say. It was time to deal with this. Time to face the facts. I was fucked. 

Sprinkles began to trickle down my face. The oven inside me suddenly shot up to 350 degrees. I bolted towards her‚Äîfull speed, fists wailing. If I was going down, this bitch was coming with me. 

Just before I reached her, I felt a sudden, sharp pain in the back of my head. I fell backward, and my body hit the ground instantly with a massive thud. I looked up and saw the counter lady standing over me, now blurry, and holding a rolling pin. Then... darkness, and the faint echo of a wet, bubbling laugh. 

When I awoke, I couldn't move, but I could see. My eyes darted all around. I was no longer in the lair of the beast. Instead, I was in a white room, surrounded by a warm, fuzzy, bright light. Everything looked soft and inviting. Placid. Peaceful. Perfect. I thought I had died. I thought maybe I was in heaven. I couldn't have been more wrong. 

*BAM!!!!!*

A giant fingertip slammed down from above, pressing hard against some sort of invisible forcefield around me. It was... it was *glass*. I was under a fucking glass dome‚Äîlying next to a chocolate whore. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. Panic surged through my jelly-filled veins.

I was paralyzed. Powerless. Positively petrified. My strawberry heart thrashed hard against my pink-slathered, rainbow-sprinkled chest as a booming voice rattled the tray beneath me. 

It said,

# Building Real Community: Btown Brief IRL ‚Äî meet people by doing stuff

**Burlington has tons going on. The Btown Brief highlights the best of it; Btown Brief IRL gets you off your couch to actually experience it.**

The idea is simple, we meet for trivia takeovers, food crawls, walks, live music, board games, bowling, volunteer days, and more. Burlington has so much to offer, why limit the meetup group to only one activity like every other group? We‚Äôre talking easy, low-pressure activities where things just flow and faces become familiar. Friendships don't appear from nowhere; they happen through casual time together, consistently. Show up a few times and proximity does the heavy lifting. Whether that's Btown Briefer-only events, or the group simply showing up together at existing happenings.

**Think of membership as showing love for the newsletter** while unlocking Burlington's social layer. Your **$3.50/month (after a free trial month)** keeps the Brief alive *and* gets you into a community that actually shows up; with Discord access, event RSVPs, and input on what we do next.

How it works: Join free for the first month, RSVP to what sounds fun, utilize Meetup.com‚Äôs features, hop into Discord to coordinate, then just show up. As we grow, we'll add age-focused nights (20s‚Äìearly-30s socials, 30s‚Äì40s dinners, 40s‚Äì50s game nights) alongside open meetups. Your attendance shapes what sticks.

**For anyone who loves Burlington and wants to experience it fully**. Whether you're new in town or born-and-raised, coming solo or with friends. Try it free, meet people, see if it fits. If it does, help us keep Burlington connected.

Just started building out the first week with casual activities, help decide what events we should show up to by using this newsletter‚Äôs Events section to see what‚Äôs going on. I don't want to build out the events too far without seeing what the vibe of the group is:

# Weather & Tuesday Rundown: (Adjusted from Monday's edition)

Tuesday's brought us another taste of early fall, with morning temperatures in the 40s and 50s that'll climb to the mid-70s under increasingly cloudy skies. Showers start rolling in between 7 and 9pm tonight, first hitting northern New York before continuing overnight. Wednesday brings our best shot at some moisture with scattered afternoon showers, though don't expect drought relief from the quarter to half inch we might see. The good news: sunshine returns Thursday with temps in the mid-70s, then we're back to proper summer with Friday hitting the low 80s. Saturday stays in the 80s with mostly sunny skies before Sunday's cold front brings storms and another cooldown.

Tonight's lineup stays strong despite the incoming showers, starting with the [ONE Farmers Market](https://frontporchforum.com/calendar/events/424640) from 3 to 6:30pm, where you can snag everything from Ghanaian food to Korean specialties before the rain arrives. For those dealing with chronic pain, there's a [free online management workshop](https://frontporchforum.com/calendar/events/439032) starting at 3:30pm that's part of Vermont's My Healthy VT program. Over at Higher Ground, [Nimesh Patel](https://highergroundmusic.com/events/nimesh-patel/) takes the stage at 9pm.

Meanwhile, [Foam Brewers hosts Local Dork](https://www.facebook.com/events/4216806711868136/4216806735201467/?active_tab=about) from 6 to 9pm, where the Wagner/Hagen vinyl duo enters their ninth season of Tuesday night grooves.

Come evening, the [Italian passeggiata tradition](https://frontporchforum.com/calendar/events/426616) takes over Church Street from 5 to 8pm.

[**Burlington's Main Street opening on nights and weekends, offering reprieve to beleaguered businesses**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/08/15/burlingtons-main-street-opening-nights-weekends-offering-reprieve-beleaguered-businesses/) 

""This has been a challenge. It's at our front step and has been for some months now. That being said, we believe in Burlington,"" per WCAX. 

The Great Streets BTV project has hammered downtown businesses with months of orange cones and construction noise, prompting hundreds of merchants to plead for relief. The city's compromise opens Main Street to traffic after 5:30pm on weekdays and all weekend through Thanksgiving, though you still can't park on Main between Church and North Winooski. Come winter shutdown, the street opens 24/7 for the crucial holiday shopping season. Temporary stop signs are filling in while crews install proper traffic lights, and while some businesses have already thrown in the towel, others are banking on Burlington's eventual glow-up being worth the current pain.

[**Phil Scott rejects Trump administration request to use Vermont national guard in president's DC crackdown**](https://vtdigger.org/2025/08/15/phil-scott-rejects-trump-administration-request-to-use-vermont-national-guard-in-presidents-dc-crackdown/) 

""The Department of Defense last week asked Scott for 'a few dozen' troops it could deploy to Washington, D.C., as part of the president's sweeping push to crack down on crime in the city,"" per VTDigger. 

This marks the second time in as many months that Vermont's Republican governor has told the Trump administration no thanks when it comes to using our National Guard for federal domestic operations. The first rejection came in July when Scott declined to let a dozen Vermont guard troops do clerical work for ICE in St. Albans. With Trump ordering hundreds of troops onto DC streets and attempting to federalize the capital's police force, Scott's stance puts Vermont firmly in the ""not participating"" column of whatever's happening down in Washington.

[**Vermonters and Canadians Express Solidarity at the Border**](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/news/vermonters-and-canadians-express-solidarity-at-the-border-44248632) 

""We're neighbors by chance, friends by choice,"" per Seven Days. 

About 40 Vermonters hiked to a Berkshire farmer's field Saturday to meet 400 Qu√©b√©cois demonstrators across a thin red rope marking the international border. Part of a continental Friends Without Borders initiative, the gathering featured butterflies, John Lennon's ""Imagine,"" and eventually some rule-breaking handshakes across the divide. While an unmarked vehicle with surveillance equipment lurked on the U.S. side, demonstrators made their point about maintaining cross-border bonds. One retired Norwich professor brought particular intensity, declaring he'll carry a burner phone to his Canadian high school reunion to avoid border searches of his anti-administration social media posts.

[**Return-to-office plans for Vermont state employees are still 'in the early stages'**](https://vtdigger.org/2025/08/15/return-to-office-plans-for-vermont-state-employees-are-still-in-the-early-stages/) 

""Remote work has been helpful, but we have plans to bring people back at least part time,"" per VTDigger. 

Governor Scott's casual announcement about bringing state workers back to offices sent ripples through the workforce last week, prompting Agency of Administration Secretary Sarah Clark to quickly reassure 8,000-plus employees that any changes are still being figured out. The state employees union has already fielded nearly 300 worried emails from workers who've been remote since Covid and through two summers of flooding. Union director Steve Howard calls the push a ""solution in search of a problem,"" warning it'll trigger retirements and recruitment nightmares. The administration promises a ""thoughtful, complete approach"" with employee input, though no timeline exists and the union hasn't heard specifics yet.

[**New UVM Program Fosters Connections Between Seniors and Students**](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/news/senior-citizens-and-students-will-forge-meaningful-connections-through-new-uvm-program-44239123) 

""For younger people, what we've really seen is an increase in empathy and appreciation for older adults,"" per Seven Days. 

The Vermont Youth Leaders in Aging program will deploy 30 to 50 high schoolers to senior communities every other week starting this September, engaging residents through art, music, and cooking activities. With Vermont ranking as the third oldest state and a quarter of our population expected to be over 65 by 2030, the $50,000 Eisner Foundation grant couldn't be better timed. UVM's Center on Aging designed the program to combat senior isolation while potentially inspiring teens to pursue eldercare careers. The initiative builds on existing intergenerational programs, with research showing both age groups benefit from regular interaction across the generational divide.

[**Massive Vermont mountain park celebrates bond between dogs and humans**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/08/18/massive-vermont-mountain-park-celebrates-bond-between-dogs-humans/) 

""It is absolutely breathtaking. That's a lot of love when you think about each picture that's here,"" per WCAX. 

Dog Mountain in St. Johnsbury has become a 150-acre pilgrimage site for pet lovers 25 years after folk artist Stephen Huneck and his wife created it. The park features hiking trails, swimming ponds, and the famous Dog Chapel where thousands of photos and notes to departed pets cover every wall. Huneck's vision manifests in carved black labs and golden retrievers adorning pew ends and stained glass windows featuring his own dog Sally. Visitors travel from across the country to this sanctuary, some returning multiple days in a row, finding it a rare space where the human-animal bond gets the monument it deserves.

[**Sen. Sanders meets with older Vermonters in Burlington**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/08/17/sen-sanders-meets-with-older-vermonters-burlington/) 

""It is not normal that one guy is worth $400 billion and seniors who have worked their entire lives are living in their excrement in a nursing home. That's not normal,"" per WCAX. 

Sanders received a standing ovation at the Hotel Champlain Sunday before launching into critiques of wealth inequality and Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill."" The senator spent most of the time listening to older Vermonters' concerns about Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and even AI. While some supporters noted Sanders himself is somewhat removed from working-class struggles, attendees appreciated his active listening as locals described hardships in nursing homes and primary care access. The event mixed policy discussion with music and mingling, giving seniors a direct line to their longtime advocate.

[**New Owner Says Most Gardener's Supply Stores Will Remain Open**](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/news/new-owner-says-most-gardeners-supply-stores-will-remain-open-44233023) 

""We see the stewardship of this institution as an honor and a responsibility,"" per Seven Days. 

Indiana-based Gardens Alive! completed its $9 million bankruptcy acquisition of the iconic Vermont company, promising to keep five of six retail locations open and retain all store workers. Only the seasonal Shelburne location gets the axe. The deal's darker side: 40 customer service and warehouse employees in Burlington and Milton were laid off without severance, some after decades with the company. Distribution moves to Ohio for ""more scalable logistics,"" though some manufacturing stays in Georgia, Vermont. The employee-owned company that started in 1983 and survived the pandemic boom couldn't weather the subsequent bust, filing for Chapter 11 in June.

[**Salmon's success bodes well for Winooski River health, but flooding and federal cuts stir fear**](https://vtdigger.org/2025/08/15/salmons-success-bodes-well-for-winooski-river-health-but-flooding-and-federal-cuts-stir-fear/) 

""Atlantic salmon are native to Lake Champlain, and it's part of our role to maintain those native populations,"" per VTDigger. 

The 2023 salmon lift at Winooski's Salmon Hole pulled 212 fish, the highest count in three decades, suggesting improved ecosystem health. Credit goes to aggressive sea lamprey control and invasive plant removal, with Burlington High School students helping rip out buckthorn to make room for native species. But last July's flooding scoured phosphorus into the water, fueling toxic algal blooms, while GlobalFoundries' PFAS dumping pushed contamination above state safety limits. Testing for PFAS costs $7,000 per sample, and with Trump proposing $37 million in cuts to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Ecological Services Program, researchers worry their 30-year progress could wash away faster than floodwater through a riverbank.

# This Week‚Äôs Restaurant Review: 

# The Great Burlington Nacho Quest: A Community Weighs In

Sometimes the most profound questions are the simplest. A few days ago, local resident Tim Corriveau posed one such question to a community Facebook group: ""Point me in the right direction for the best nachos within 25 miles of Burlington.""

The question unleashed a flood of passionate recommendations, proving that when it comes to cheese, chips, and toppings, everyone has a favorite. From traditional plates to wildly inventive creations, the community built the ultimate guide to local nachos.

# The People's Champions: The Most-Mentioned

While dozens of places were named, a few clear front-runners emerged based on the number of mentions and passionate endorsements.

* **Blackback Pub (Waterbury):** The undisputed champion of the comment section. At least eight different people recommended their unique ""Vermont-style"" nachos, featuring cheddar, blue cheese, bacon, and a chipotle maple syrup drizzle. As one commenter put it, ""I thought they sounded strange, but my friends and I are addicted!"" It seems these are well worth the trip.
* **Upper Deck Pub (Burlington):** A strong local favorite, receiving at least five shout-outs. Their classic nachos, especially when topped with chili, are a go-to for many.
* **Stone Corral Brewery (Richmond):** This spot earned high praise for having a couple of different delicious nacho varieties.
* **Burlington Beer Company (BBCO):** Three separate commenters urged people to try the ""Korean Nachos."" One said, ""Trust me you won't be sorry.""
* **Casa Real (Williston/St. Albans):** A popular choice for those craving authentic, classic Mexican-style nachos.

# Other Top Contenders & Unique Finds

The nacho love didn't stop there. Here are the other fantastic recommendations from the thread:

* **Classic & Hearty:**
   * **The Daily Planet** (Burlington)
   * **Nelly's Pub & Grill** (St. Albans) - Praised for their huge portions.
   * **El Gato** (Burlington) - With a hat-tip to their half-price Thursday special.
   * **Taco Gordo** (Burlington)
   * **The Old Post** (South Burlington)
   * **El Cortijo** (Burlington)
   * **Rozzi's Lakeshore Tavern** (Colchester)
   * **Shelburne Tap House** (Shelburne)
   * **Village Tavern** (Ferrisburg)
* **Creative Twists:**
   * **Twiggs - An American Gastropub** (St. Albans) - Recommended for their ""BOMB"" Irish Nachos.
   * **Prohibition Pig** (Waterbury)
   * **Ri Ra's** (Burlington) - Got a mention for their BBQ chicken nachos.
   * **Spare Time** (Colchester) - Surprisingly noted as ""the best nachos I‚Äôve ever had!""

1mugwdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricmotorcycles/comments/1mugwdx/where_can_i_find_the_best_deals_on_cheap_electric/,Where Can I Find the Best Deals on Cheap Electric Motorcycle?,"So, I was hanging out with my colleague last weekend and she casually rolled up to our coffee spot on this sleek little electric motorcycle. Not the bulky kind you see in showrooms but this one was comfortable, balanced and honestly looked way more expensive than it probably was.
Naturally, I asked where she got it. She grinned and said, ‚ÄúLong story.‚Äù From her response, it looked like she didn‚Äôt want to tell us where she got it from. She only said we should figure out where we can get a cheap electric motorcycle like hers by ourselves.
I was persistent, and she eventually opened up. Sadly, most of the advice she gave me was about brand names and dealerships, whereas I wanted something that wouldn‚Äôt wipe out my savings.
Asides being reminded of the fact that good things are expensive, I resolved to find a vendor that could offer it at an affordable rate.
I even vaguely remembered seeing it on a forum once, with a passing reference buried in the comments that sounded like Alibaba, though I wasn‚Äôt even sure at the time.
I wish she could just tell me, and not be so vague about it. So yeah, if you have a trusted source or you‚Äôve heard/know an affordable vendor, please drop it in the comments. DM if it's absolutely necessary.",0,1755606201.0,Electricmotorcycles,1,0.4,False

The kind where you make up excuses not to go out, or mentally rehearse ordering a coffee ten times before actually stepping in line.

I‚Äôve been through the usual list: 

* Therapy (helpful, but slow),  
* Meditation (good on calm days, useless when panic hits),  
* Even prescription meds like Xanax (which honestly made me feel like a zombie and left me wiped out).

A friend suggested CBD gummies a few months ago and I rolled my eyes. Figured it was just another wellness trend. But here‚Äôs the thing: I started taking a small dose before situations I usually avoid (meeting new people, crowded events, even grocery shopping at busy times)‚Ä¶ and the edge actually comes off. I don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúhigh‚Äù or detached, just‚Ä¶ calmer. Like my brain isn‚Äôt on constant overdrive.

It hasn‚Äôt cured my anxiety. I still overthink. I still feel nervous sometimes. But the difference is I *go*. I leave the house. I don‚Äôt cancel every plan last minute. And that‚Äôs honestly a huge shift for me.

Curious if anyone else here has had a similar experience with CBD for social anxiety? Or am I just placeboing myself into finally functioning a little better?",2,1755606113.0,cbdinfo,2,1.0,False

Help needed!,"I have a Sage Barista Touch and it previously worked as expected e.g., first drop of espresso starting on 8 seconds and getting around 40ml espresso from 18g coffee with 25 seconds brew time (fineness setting between 9-14/30 depending on the bean). 

However, I now have to set my machine to the lowest fineness setting (1/30) and the pour starts on 6 seconds and gives 80ish ml coffee with 25 second pour. 

I‚Äôm using the double shot basket which is what I‚Äôve always used and tamping pressure is roughly the same as I‚Äôve always done. Any ideas or tips welcome! Any parameters I can tweak to solve the problem?
