Feels almost too simple. But maybe that’s why it works.

1nch2i3,https://i.redd.it/za80tcmpq4of1.jpeg,Marking my attendance for Team #KhamrahQahwa,"I am gonna be honest -  we didn’t really need ANOTHER Khamrah Qahwa review. This one has been all over social media since its launch. But Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa is one of my top 5 favourites (yes I am basic) and I just really wanted this on my feed, so please bear with me.


The notes are all there on Fragrantica, but to my nose, Khamrah Qahwa is a beautiful cacophony of warm spices, vanilla, and what Lattafa claims to be a coffee note ( but it’s more of a guest appearance than a main character, I said what I said.) 🤷🏽‍♀️



Qahwa is essentially a sequel to the OG khamrah. If you haven’t tried the OG, definitely try a decant. You may love it or hate it, but not trying at least one of the two is honestly an experience you would be missing out on.



Khamrah Qahwa opens with this burst of Christmas vibes. Cinnamon, Cardamom, ginger - base ingredients of something edible you would expect to smell during Christmas season. If there’s an old bakery in your city that you have visited at least once, you know this smell. That, or a cinnamon bun from Ikea with a steaming cuppa. ☕️



Once that opening fades, Khamrah Qahwa envelopes you in a cozy hug of syrupy, slightly boozy vanilla, warm musk, some tonka beans, and hints of coffee/chocolate that make sure you are not choking yourself, or others around you. It’s solely there to balance out the sweet notes, and it hits the spot rather perfectly. 🥂


Cozy is the story with this one. You may love it or trash it, but Khamrah Qahwa is undeniably a compliment puller. We are so used to thinking of basic middle-eastern fragrances as dupes/clones (for good reasons), but Khamrah Qahwa is an OG. For its current price point of average 2200/- INR in 2025, it’s unbelievable how good this scent is. ✨


Khamrah Qahwa wasn’t made for any other season than the winters. The OG Khamrah has a sparkling, syrupy sweet vibe to it that I find much more balanced out in Qahwa.  Both fairly unisex, the Dukhan flanker is perhaps the most masculine out of the three.




TLDR: Sweet boozy vanilla with tons of warm spices, cozy AF, performs great in cold weather - if you haven’t tried it yet, you definitely should. Winters are coming, and you might just end up liking this one.

1nch150,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1nch150/calories_in_beverages/,Calories in Beverages,"Before I start, I want to be clear; I'm not interested in talking about alcohol consumption/alcohol problems. This is purely related to calories. I track my alcohol consumption in another app and work hard to stay within my country's alcohol guidelines. Also I'm Irish, if that helps. 

About two months ago, I added the ""drinks"" category to my calorie counting app. It's extremely illuminating. I add all my beverages, alcohol or otherwise, to my app. The calories in even low sugar sodas is wild. I drink about five cups of tea a day, with 5mls of full fat milk. I add that too. Thankfully I don't drink fancy coffees.  On a day with zero alcohol consumed, I can easily drink 80 to 100 calories. A protein smoothie in there and we're up at 200. 

Add a pint of beer and that gets up to 400, easily. 

In a similar way to people forgetting to count sauces, I can see how people might leave out beverages. It really makes a difference, especially if you have a beer or two a day. Calorie counting made me skip beer way more than I usually would, especially if it means I can eat those calories and gain nutrition instead. 

Hope this is interesting to people who don't necessarily see their drinks as calorie dense. ",1,1757419483.0,loseit,1,1.0,False

1ncgzhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1ncgzhy/upgrading_my_coffee_setup_advice_needed/,Upgrading my coffee setup – advice needed!,"I will start by saying I am **not a coffee expert**. 

Right now, I have a Nespresso machine with a milk frother. I stick to the official Nespresso cups and the frother does a great job. But whenever I make espresso with my Bialetti (mini express), I notice a clear difference in taste. I usually drink cappuccinos, but when I have coffee black, I like it really strong. My boyfriend, on the other hand, prefers filter coffee (Moccamaster, V60, Chemex) - so our tastes are quite different.

Whenever I go out for coffee, it always tastes better than what I make at home. Now that I'm no longer a student, I would like to upgrade my at-home setup. I don’t mind spending more time on the process or learning the details, though it does feel a little overwhelming.  don’t need push-button convenience — I’d rather put in a bit of effort. What matters to me mostly is that the machine + milk frother are reliable.

Here’s where I’m at:

* I love the look of machines like the DeLonghi Specialista Arte or Sage Barista Express — that clean stainless-steel design really appeals to me
* But after some research, I see most beginners are advised to buy a **separate grinder rather than an all-in-one machine**. I get it now: performance > looks.
* So far, I’ve looked at: 
   * **Fellow Opus Grinder** 
   * **Sage Bambino Plus** 

  
Budget-wise, I don’t mind spending a few hundred euros more if it means a setup that will last me for years. At the same time, I’m still tempted by “all-in-one” machines just because of aesthetics.

So, what would you recommend for someone in my situation? Is the Bambino + a good grinder the right path, or should I consider something else? If you have any recommendations, both for grinders or machines themselves, please let me know! ",1,1757419354.0,Coffee,0,1.0,False

For a while now, I've been creating deep-dive, manual analysis reports for a few clients to help them make better decisions. The process showed me that while basic information is available, getting truly deep, actionable intelligence is incredibly time-consuming and often requires expensive consultations.

My reports usually answer the main questions in the first 1 or 2 pages, and have 100+ pages of supporting data/analyses if they want to dig deeper. It’s partly automated, partly manual, so it takes time. Alot of time! I’m exploring whether to fully automate it and make it available to everyone on a website. So, before doing that I want to hear from you about your pain points.

**For example, many clients I work with struggle with questions like:** 

* Should I buy or rent?
* Should I keep my unit or sell?
* If I want steady rental income vs. price appreciation, which option makes more sense?
* Is a 'distress deal' really a good deal compared to the building's sales history and the wider community?
* How long do rental units in a specific tower actually stay vacant between tenants, compared to the wider community?

**The reports combine market data at different levels (building -> community -> area -> Dubai) and cover things like:**

* Rental yields & rent-to-mortgage ratios (basically when do renters switch to buyers)
* How quickly units get rented out when they’re vacant
* How long tenants typically stay in a unit
* Occupancy trends in older vs. newer buildings (can signal maintenance & other factors)

**On top of the numbers, I also include predictive and qualitative insights. For example - ML-based rent/price forecasts, or things like traffic congestion (using metro & RTA buses data), flood risk in lower-lying areas, public transport access, traffic accidents in your area, and even parking availability from RTA data. The idea is to give a full picture, not just raw numbers.**

I have more on what insights it covers and what questions it can answer, but I don’t want to overload people with details. Also, mainly **I don't want to risk leading people to answer based on my framing instead of their real frustrations**. What I want to know is: which of these kinds of insights actually matter to you? Or is there something completely different you’d find more useful?

**So before I go down the road of building something for everyone, I want to hear from you -** 

1. When you rent/buy/invest in Dubai, what’s the hardest part of the process?
2. What information do you wish you had but find hard to get or trust?
3. Have you ever felt you overpaid or missed a good deal? what would’ve helped?
4. What tools/websites do you currently use, and what’s missing from them?

**I’m not here to sell anything right now (**eventually I want to though**). I am just trying to validate if there’s a real need and if what I’m doing actually solves it (or if I should be thinking about this differently). I have burnt my fingers in the past by overlooking this important step, so not again.**

I want to build in public, so if this idea seems to have legs, I plan on sharing the journey and progress with this community.

So, any and all feedback is welcome. Tell me if you think this is a crazy idea or if it's something you'd find useful.

For anyone who's really passionate about this and wants to talk more, apart from the open discussion here, feel free to send me a DM. I'm based in AUH and would be happy to even grab a coffee to hear about your experiences firsthand.

I was going to try just subbing in an already made vanilla protein drink for the fairlife nonfat milk today, but I’m a little worried that would turn out sickly sweet since matcha doesn’t have the ability to cut sweetness as effectively as espresso does.

Do you have any IT Project Management rituals?

The things that, if you don’t do them, you don’t feel like you’ve ***really*** started the project…

Of course there are things that you ***have to*** ***do***, like check your available human resources and, if you find a gap, call Stoneseed’s Project management as a Service experts … but doing that is a given. Right?

What I’m talking about is the quirky little human things that we do that signal to our brain that we have started the project, and that we mean business!!!

**Any excuse to eat chocolate**

My muse for this blog is Kay, a [public sector](https://www.stoneseed.co.uk/procurement-frameworks/) IT Project leader based in London.

Kay is a level-headed, professional, and focussed project goddess! It was something of a surprise then, during a recent call about resourcing an upcoming project, when Kay finished a sentence about needing a Business Analyst and PMO Services with this off-the-cuff aside: “Oh and I’ll need to buy in the chocolate.”

Now, we all like a snack at work, but for Kay, filling the fridge with bars of 70%-solids dark chocolate is a ritual.

What’s more, each different project has its ***own*** variant of chocolate. With a portfolio like Kay’s, that can mean multiple brands of chocolate in the fridge at any one time, each assigned to an individual project – and chunks of each ***only*** to be eaten while working on that project.

If Green And Blacks is assigned to Project X, eating the Lindt assigned to Project Y would be like allocating an inappropriate resource to an inappropriate task!!!

I remember thinking, “That’s endearing!”

It turns out that Kay is far from alone.

It also turns out that IT project talent don’t just have rituals to start projects, some of us have them to start the day, a new Work Breakdown Structure component or work session too!

**The science behind rituals**

Kay’s ritual may seem cute, but rituals go beyond mere superstition or routine.

They are deeply rooted in psychological science.

Repeating a ritual regularly acts as a mental cue, telling your brain it’s time to transition into a new or different state – in our case delivering high-impact business change through IT Projects.

The value of rituals is linked to neuroplasticity, your brain’s ability to adapt by forming new neural pathways. Through repetition, your brain begins to associate the ritual with a specific mental or emotional state. Eventually, just starting the ritual can trigger a near-automatic shift in your mindset, focus, or emotional readiness.

There is lots of evidence of the effectiveness in sport, and especially among athletes.

I read once that footballer Cristiano Ronaldo uses a combination of visualisation and physical movements when warming up, mentally imagining scoring goals and winning the match, aligning his mental and physical preparation, and syncing his mind and body before kick-off.

In US basketball, LeBron James’ pre-game ritual is to throw a puff of chalk into the air. This cloud of chalk-dust acts as a mental cue for LeBron, signalling his transition from his off-court self to his on-court power forward self, ready to dominate the match.

In moments of intense pressure, when stress and anxiety are high, a well-practiced ritual can be a mental reset, that helps clear distractions and initiate a flow state where performance is optimised (and any inner doubts fade).

That’s the real power of rituals: they’re intentional tools for training the brain to access its highest potential on command.

I would love to hear your rituals! In the meantime, to add to Kay’s chocolate ritual, here are:

**The startists! four more fabulous IT project talent rituals**

**New project coffee – Jessica from Sutton Coldfield**

Coffee is the fuel that powers many a project! While most settle for the same brand of instant, all year round, for Jessica and her team near Birmingham – the world is their oyster.

“We start a new project with a new flavour of coffee beans,” Jessica told me, “It all began when our favourite coffee shop opened an in-house roastery! So, thanks, Coffee Wizards!!! The coffee is always local, there’s plenty around the West Midlands and surrounding areas, so I don’t see us running out of new flavours any time soon!”

Jessica tells me that having a signature coffee for each project gives it an emotional continuity, even team members working remotely have the same coffee. The sound of the office coffee grinder is like an audible mental switch-on each morning, the smell of a new coffee beans at the start of a project and the aroma of freshly ground beans and freshly brewed coffee each morning “are enough to make us even look forward to coming to work!”

Put a pot on Jessica – we are on our way!!!!

**A walk – Sally from Retford**

“I’m so lucky to be able to step out of my door into beautiful countryside and farm fields so, I do, before starting every day. Regardless of the weather.”

There’s heaps of evidence about the value of fresh air and even gentle exercise and their effect on mental health, work-performance, focus and happiness – this sounds like a great ritual.

For Sally it’s more than the health benefits: “Working from home, it’s important to have something that mentally switches me from ‘eating-breakfast-at-the-kitchen-table-Sally’ to ‘project-managing-wonder-woman-Sally’, especially as I often do both at the same kitchen tables! So, 8.50, without fail, Molly-dog and I have a walk round the village to clear our heads, the brook that runs through the village is so calming ahead of a busy day too!”

**Scented candle – Sue from Gainsborough**

“My working day is not considered started until I’ve lit and can smell the aromas of my citrus scented candle. It lives on my desk and so long as I can smell that, my head is in work-mode.”

Sue was among a handful who told me that their ritual involved the sense of smell. I suppose it’s a sense that you can use while deploying all the others on your project work – you need your ears for taking phone calls, your eyes for studying the Gantt chart and your fingers for typing up all that documentation.

Sue works on a hybrid basis and, imagining scented candles setting off fire-alarms and water-sprinklers, I asked what she does on days that she has to attend the office. “I’ve chosen a brand that does reed diffusers in the same scent. The team think I’m a legend bringing them in and freshening up the office, only I, and now you know the truth,” she replied.

**Clapping – Adam from Werneth**

Adam from Werneth, in Oldham, told me that he claps three times to signal the start of any period of work and that it’s something that he brought from the Sunday league football pitch – if it’s good enough for Ronaldo!!!!

“During a match, before a kick off, a set piece, or any new phase of play, I clap and shout something like “come on lads” or “turn and face”, I hadn’t realised I’d started doing it at work until a colleague asked me to “keep it down”. I still do it … but away from where I could disturb others”

I’ve found exploring rituals absorbing, get in touch with any of your own.

I love the “pyscho-science” behind these rituals, and I’d be fascinated to hear the benefits and impacts that ***your*** rituals have on your IT Projects!!

Remember to make checking out Stoneseed’s Project Management as a Service universe a ritual before you start IT Projects!

Right, I’d better get to back to ***my*** latest project, but first, I should indulge my pre-work ritual. Pop the kettle on and crack open the custard creams! I’m going in!!!!!

1ncgucp,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1ncgucp/evaluate_zep_stainless_steel_cleaner_is_it_really/,Evaluate Zep Stainless Steel Cleaner Is It Really Smudge Free,"**Shiny Surfaces Made Simple**  

Testing the Zep R53512 stainless steel cleaner felt like tackling a daily challenge but with a superhero cape on. This product came into my life after too many evenings spent glaring at stubborn smudges and fingerprints on my stainless steel appliances. It promises a two-in-one solution, and honestly, I had some initial skepticism. After all, how many products have made grand claims only to leave behind streaks, or worse, an oily mess that you spend hours fighting? With Zep R53512, though, I quickly realized this wasn’t just another household gimmick.

**Performance You Can Observe**  

The performance stood out right from the first swipe. It removes smudges with minimal effort and leaves a polished surface that feels almost mirror-like. Perfect for fridges, ovens, and even faucets, it gave my kitchen a facelift without needing elaborate buffing. What sets it apart is the invisible barrier it forms to resist future smears, making it a game-changer for busy households. Most days, I can go a couple of extra meals or coffee brews without diving into another cleaning frenzy.  
   
[Ready to buy Zep R53512? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b0dtz4tct8/)

**Ease of Application Matters**  

The spray-on formula is straightforward and fuss-free. With some stainless steel cleaners, you feel like you’re either smothering your surfaces in grease or scrubbing like you’re attacking a medieval knight’s armor. Zep gets rid of both problems. The action is smooth, and the water-based formula ensures no oily residue remains behind. This alone won me over since no one wants a shiny surface that feels sticky.

**Benefits**  

- Creates a clean, polished look without streaking  
- Protects against future smudges, reducing frequent cleaning  
- Water-based and lightweight formula ensures no greasy after-effect  

**Shortcomings**  

- Sharp fragrance that might be bothersome for sensitive noses  
- Larger bottle; tricky for small storage spaces  
- Might require a thorough rinse if applied too generously

**Durability of Results**  

What I loved most is how long the results last. After cleaning with this product, my fridge and dishwasher looked impeccable for days. It genuinely cuts down cleaning frequency and reduces the frustration of constantly dealing with fingerprints or watermarks post-touch. However, I did find that overexerting the cleaner occasionally left a very faint residue on older stainless steel, though it’s easy to buff away.

**Competing Options**  

Compared to Bar Keepers Friend, which is another stainless steel cleaning favorite, Zep R53512 shines in its dual smudge-cleaning and prevention claim. While Bar Keepers Friend gets accolades for handling hard water stains, it doesn’t protect against grime build-up over time as effectively as Zep. Likewise, Weiman Stainless Steel Cleaner offers similar polishing, but the consistency often leaves a heavier residue than I’d like. Zep lands somewhere in the sweet spot— effective against smears without any extra work.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  

On the cost spectrum, Zep R53512 doesn’t break the bank. It’s affordable without compromising performance, and its formula’s longevity means you’ll get quite a bit of mileage out of it. Considering its dual-purpose action of both cleaning and preventing smudges, it’s a clear winner in terms of utility and cost-efficiency. Unless you’re on a tight budget, the slight price premium over generic cleaners feels justified.

# Sleep Lean Review 2025: My Honest Story After 90 Days – Did I Really Lose Weight While Sleeping?

https://preview.redd.it/ireky1cdn4of1.png?width=537&format=png&auto=webp&s=18da060448c4bc7a5dc041fd272d62fce2efb964

# 

# INTRODUCTION:

# Okay, let’s be real for a second.

When I first saw an ad for Sleep Lean, I laughed. ""Lose weight while sleeping?"" I thought, ""Yeah, right. That’s what they all say.""

I’ve triedso manythings over the years. Keto. Intermittent fasting. That 30-day ab challenge (which I quit after day 3). Nothing really stuck. And honestly? I was tired — not just of failing, but oftrying. I have two kids, a full-time job, and my brain never shuts off at night. I’d lie in bed for hours, thinking about everything… and then wake up feeling worse than when I went to bed.

So when I heard about Sleep Lean — a natural supplement that helps you sleep betterandburn fat at night — I was skeptical. But desperate. And hey, what if it actually worked?

Turns out… it kind of did.

# Why I Needed This (Spoiler: It Wasn’t Just About Weight)

I’m not overweight, but I’ve had this stubborn belly fat for years. Like, no matter how much I walk or eat clean, it just… stayed. And I was always tired. Craving sugar. Snacking at night. Waking up groggy.

My friend Sarah told me, “You’re stressed, not lazy.” And she was right. Stress was messing up my sleep, and bad sleep was messing up my hormones — especially cortisol, the one that stores fat around your waist.

I read that deep sleep is when your body burns fat most efficiently. But if you’re not reaching that deep stage? You’re just… not burning much.

So I thought: maybe the problem isn’t my diet or exercise. Maybe it’s mysleep.

That’s when I decided to try Sleep Lean.

https://preview.redd.it/9fwawa6in4of1.png?width=539&format=png&auto=webp&s=44b035d5dbcfc59fa3c65a2f47be7c94bd593a9e

# What’s Inside? (I Actually Read the Label)

I don’t trust supplements with mystery ingredients. So first thing I did? Checked what’s really inside.

Sleep Lean has 8 natural ingredients, all designed to help your body relax, sleep deeper, and support fat burning at night. Here’s what stood out to me:

* Melatonin (3mg): Helps reset your sleep clock. Not too much, not too little.
* 5-HTP: Comes from a plant. Helps with mood and stops late-night cravings.
* Ashwagandha: This one’s big. It’s an adaptogen — means it fights stress. And stress = belly fat.
* Valerian Root & Chamomile: Old-school herbs for sleep. Calms your mind.
* Berberine: I’d heard of this — helps with blood sugar and metabolism.
* L-Theanine: From green tea. Makes you calm but alert during the day, sleepy at night.

All of it is non-GMO, vegan, and made in an FDA-registered facility in the USA. No sketchy fillers. No hidden stimulants.

That gave me confidence.

# My 90-Day Journey – Week by Week

Week 1: “Okay… I Slept Better?”

First night? Nothing special. Second night? I fell asleep faster. By night 3, I didn’t wake up at 3 a.m. wondering why I exist. That was new.

No grogginess in the morning. No weird dreams. Just… better sleep.

But no weight loss yet.

If you're tired of tossing and turning, give Sleep Lean a real shot. Not for one night — give it 5–7 days. That’s when the magic starts.

Week 2–4: The Cravings Stopped

This was wild. I stopped wanting snacks after dinner. Like, I’d usually eat something sweet around 9 p.m., but now? I just… didn’t feel like it.

I had more energy during the day. Didn’t need coffee by 10 a.m. And my skin looked better — less puffy, more glowy.

I stepped on the scale. Down 2 pounds. Not huge, but I hadn’t changed anything else.

Month 2: My Jeans Felt Loose

I wasn’t “dieting,” but I was eating less — because I wasn’t hungry. And I was sleeping 7–8 hours straight.

After 6 weeks, I lost 5 pounds. But therealchange? My waist. I measured it — down 3 inches.

My husband even said, “Did you lose weight?” And I said, “Yes… while sleeping.”

He didn’t believe me.

Belly fat that won’t budge? It might not be your diet — it could be your sleep.

Try Sleep Lean today and see if your body finally gets the rest it needs to burn fat.

Month 3: I Finally Felt Light Again

By day 90, I’d lost 8 pounds. But again, the weight wasn’t the biggest win.

I felt calmer. My mood was better. I wasn’t snapping at my kids. I had energy to play with them after work.

And I wasn’t obsessed with food anymore. No more “I deserve this cookie” guilt.

Sleep Lean didn’t magically melt fat. It helped my bodywork the way it’s supposed to— when it’s rested.

# The Good, The Bad, and The Real

# ✅ What I Loved:

* Fell asleep faster (within 15–20 minutes).
* Stayed asleep all night.
* No morning grogginess (unlike melatonin gummies).
* Fewer cravings, especially at night.
* Lost weightwithoutstarving or over-exercising.
* 90-day money-back guarantee — even if the bottle’s empty. That’s rare.
* Bonus books were actually useful (one on anti-aging smoothies, another on confidence).

❌ What I Didn’t Love:

* Took 3–4 days to feel results. Not instant.
* Only available online — can’t buy it at Walmart or Amazon (to avoid fakes).
* A bit expensive if you buy just one bottle. But the 6-bottle pack is way cheaper.

Don’t waste money on fake versions. I’ve seen them on Amazon — same name, different ingredients.

Always buy from the official website to get the real formula + free bonuses.

# How It Compares to Other Stuff I’ve Tried

* Melatonin alone: Makes me sleepy, but I wake up tired. No fat loss.
* Resurge: Similar, but gave me a weird taste in my mouth. Sleep Lean felt cleaner.
* Burn PM: Too strong. Made me feel weird in the morning.
* Prescription sleep aids: No thanks. I don’t want to be dependent.

Sleep Lean is different. It’s not a “knock-you-out” pill. It’s more like… helping your body remember how to sleep and heal itself.

# Who Should Try Sleep Lean?

# Honestly? If you:

* Can’t fall asleep or stay asleep,
* Wake up tired no matter how many hours you sleep,
* Snack at night (especially when stressed),
* Have belly fat that won’t go away,
* Are over 35 and feel like your metabolism slowed down…

Then yeah. Give it a shot.

It’s not for everyone. If you’re pregnant, on meds, or have a health condition, talk to your doctor first.

But for people like me — stressed, tired, stuck — it might be the missing piece.

And who knows? You might wake up lighter.

Worst case? You sleep better. Best case? You wake up a new version of you.And if you don’t like it? They’ll give you every penny back — even if the bottle’s empty.

First of all, I want to apologize because English is not my first language, I hope I can be clear. Also, all names will be changed.

We are going to start with some context: I (F24) studied electrical engineering, so my friend group is basically just guys with the exception of one girl (we became super close and say we saved each others' asses). My boyfriend Chris (M25) and I met in the company where we did our internship. At the time we met, he was in a relationship of 3 years with a girl named Sarah (F25) and I was casually dating someone, but it didn't work out in the end. Chris and I bonded over football and quickly became friends. I was used to being surrounded by guys, so I didn't think anything more of our friendship, to me he was just one more friend.

Because of our friendship I got to meet Sarah, we went out a couple times, sometimes in double dates. I wouldn't say Sarah and I became friends, but we could go out and have a good time. In our outings I would see their interactions as a couple, which where not entirely healthy (usually passive aggressive comments from Sarah) but I never asked Chris about it or if there were any problems (learned the hard way with another friend).

Chris on the other hand, has had a female ""best friend"" Lucy (F25) since they were in high school, and when they started university in another city, they decided to live together in an apartment. Eventually, Sarah moved in as well, so the 3 of them were living together. Like I said, I knew things were not perfect between Chris and Sarah, but I thought they were going to get married (I even asked him, and he told me the proposal idea).

A year went by, and Chris and I finished our internship and also graduated from our respective universities. I got a Job, met a guy there and started dating (this is important to clarify on my side, so you don't call me a home wrecker lol). A couple months later Sarah also starts working in the company in a different department (FML). Everything was going well between this guy and me but when it came to family plans, we were not aligned so we decided to stop seeing each other, no hard feelings, everything was very mature from both ends. A few days later, Chris texted me and told me If I was up for a coffee and I said yes, then he told me he had broken up with Sarah. I asked him If he was alright and he told me it was for the best, that he came to the realization that they were not compatible and that she mistreated him often, that's when I told him of the things I observed since I met them, and that indeed i didn't think It was a healthy relationship, he then told me a bit more and gave me examples of her behavior which honestly were far worse and more manipulative than what i was used to see. I continued to see Sarah at work and was nice to her but just that.

A couple months went by and then Chris tells me that he has feelings for me, and asks me if I would be open to try dating (was really sweet how it happened but that's another story) and I said yes, and honestly It has been the best decision ever, the first weeks were a bit weird and it took me some time to change the chip in my head that we are more than friends, but it's been great, falling in love with your best friend is amazing!

Now after this really long context, I come to this forum to see if I'm overreacting. His ""best friend"" Lucy became Sarah's friend, which i thought it was normal when I met them because well, girlfriend of the best friend then roommates. But when I got to see the toxic behavior, I never quite understood how you can be friends with someone that mistreats your so called ""lifelong best friend"". In my case, it was different I would say, I needed to be in good terms with her because I came after the relationship, but I don't see myself becoming friends with my uni friends gfs if they are AH towards them.

Once Chris and Sarah broke up, Lucy stayed friends with Sarah, I kind of understood but still couldn't believe you would stay friends with someone that treated your friend the way I later found out, specially if you lived with them. When we started dating, I told Chris I wanted him to talk to Sarah to set things straight and avoid any misunderstanding that maybe there was foul play, and he agreed. A few days later he told me that Lucy told him he shouldn't do it because they haven't really spoken but maybe I should do it because we see each other often. I got mad, and told him I didn't care, I wanted him to talk to her because they have friends in common and If things were not clear rumors would start, and I didn't want to be uncomfortable when around them. He agreed once more.

A few days passed and Lucy texted Chris and told him that Sarah already knew, she didn't know how she found out and that she was ""ok"" with it.

This is the itinerary that we decided, that has some fun for everyone: Tokyo from 31/12/25 to 06/01/26, Nagoya from 06/01/26 to 09/01/26, Kyoto from 09/01/26 to 13/01/26.

My son is addicted to Pokémon, so we are going to visit what that we find about it. Also he loves Totoro, so I'll try to go to the Ghibli Museum (already put on my calendar the opening tickets day). Any special tips to travel with a kid to Japan?

We are trying to balance things for him and for the family. We live in Paris, he is used to walk a lot with us.

I would like some tips about places to eat in those cities (we love yakitoris, ramen and guiozas), have a good coffe with quality beans, matcha drinks, nice deserts too. We don't need fancy restaurants, it's not our style.  
  
Also some cute shops, stationery shops, nice neighborhoods to walk around and stop for a coffee, have a bite to eat. I know it's generic, but I like to know neighborhoods that are non-tourist places when I travel.

In Tokyo we are staying at Asakusa, in Nagoya near the main station, in Kyoto at Azuchicho.

My husband 35M and I 35F have been together for nearly 5 years. We have a one year old child together, and I’m currently pregnant with our second. I’m completely fed up with my husband’s hygiene habits, which are seriously affecting our intimacy. I realise I haven’t wanted to make out with him in years. It’s not because I don’t want to, it’s because I can’t.

His oral hygiene has gotten worse during the time we’ve been together, and recently his personal toilet hygiene has been shocking. I mean unflushed number 2s, toilet bowl not cleaned, skid marks on our sheets because he insists on sleeping naked.

In the past I thought these were one offs and I brought them up as sensitively as I could because I recognised how embarrassing it could be. I would be mortified if I found my shit floating in the toilet, or I had skidmarks on the sheets. I brought the skidmark sheets up to him and he said “sorry”, but did he change them? No. Did it happen again? Yes absolutely. 3 months in a row at least.

Some additional context:
	•	He rarely brushes his teeth, and if he does it’s not obvious to me. He hasn’t seen a dentist in at least a decade (maybe less but I’m not sure), and has visible plaque and had dark patches on his tongue when he smoked. He said he would brush in the shower but it wasn’t always evident. He would always use mouthwash but maybe he didn’t brush. He brushed his teeth if we planned to have sex, but it was after I asked him on multiple occasions.

	•	He drinks alcohol and eats sweets every night, and I’ve repeatedly brought up how this impacts his teeth and breath, and his overall health.

	•	He will talk very close to me or try to kiss me during the day without brushing or after having coffee, which makes me feel physically sick.

Despite my repeated requests, reminders, and honest conversations, nothing changes long-term. He mumbles a self pitying “sorry” and then continues the same habits.

He blames some of the oral health stuff on ADHD, which I understand because I have it too, but if I notice my breath is bad, I brush. I don’t expose others to it. He blames the unflushed toilet on forgetting or being in a hurry, but OMG how much time or effort does it take to flush?!?! 

I feel like I’m parenting him. I shouldn’t have to constantly remind him about basic hygiene. The only saving grace at this point is that he showers, and he’s a good partner and father in all other respects.

The more this goes on the more I don’t want to be intimate with him. We already have bare minimum intimacy with having a kid and stuff, but I’m so over it. I want to kiss and cuddle my man. I want to be able to make out with him. He wants the same and voices this often.

I’m anxious when we go out because I’m like “omg did he brush his teeth”. His breath has been awful in front of family and in small spaces and I’ve been so embarrassed. This is taking a toll on my emotional and physical connection with him, and I don’t know how to fix it when he says a self pitying sorry, temporarily and briefly changes then reverts back to doing the same. 

I really don’t want to shame him. The other day I had enough and I told him it’s pissed me off and I’m disgusted after finding new skidmarks and an unflushed toilet. He gave me the same sort of reply and said he didn’t know how I wanted him to respond. WTF?!!!

What am I supposed to do about this? I’ve addressed it several times over the years and more in the recent months. I love my husband and want to be physically close to him but I’m really starting to get the ick.",20,1757418388.0,relationship_advice,36,0.81,False

That may sounds like a really stupid question, but I am at a loss as to why the prices at Luckin always change for some reason. 

For context, I always order the same coffee (that coconut milk banger), but I am puzzled by the fact they're **never** the same price. Sometimes they're at 9.9rmb, sometimes at 10.x, 12.x, the last one I ordered was 13 or so. And they never increase over time, today I may pay 13 and tomorrow only 10. 

I understand that may have something to do with some sort of coupons, but I never do anything to reclaim those because I don't understand Chinese. 

So I don't know, it's depending on the time of the day maybe?

Only asking so that if I understand the mechanics under that, I may consciously and purposely claim cheaper coffees instead of thinking it is pure luck 🥹",1,1757418257.0,AskChina,2,1.0,False

It is not already in the billions(market cap would be higher than ETH for a 1000x) and chances are it is not in the hundreds of millions for similar reasons. However, it could be in the 10s of millions and chances are it probably is.

If we are going off past 1000x's we can narrow the coin down to those with insane hardworking communities, those who are changing the game. 

We see Doge, Shib, Pepe etc and see their success was due to their community efforts and other things but we do not see the fact that they were revolutionary at the time. Following previous footsteps and not innovating is not enough. A project must follow what works and then also build upon the glory of the predecessors. 

**To me the next 1000x is not just a coin that dominates social media, but they must also dominate somewhere else, imo this is IRL.**

This is why my pick for the next 1000x is **Kendu**

**How Kendu Is Dominating Social Media**

Kendu has an insane Reddit presence and can be seen on the altcoin subreddits, scrolling down the feed you're gonna see Kendu everywhere with unmatched engagement, we have the strongest presence on Reddit in the game rn. On Stocktwits and X we are also insanely strong with presence almost everywhere. We keep up with the best on these 2(even those with way higher market caps, this just shows truly how strong the Kendu community is. Our Telegram activity is actually insane as well beating SPX, Mog and Giga over weekly periods!

**How Kendu Is Dominating IRL and Improving On Previous 1000x's Efforts**

Kendu has over 20 IRL efforts and is literally making unprecedented progress, these initiatives are all pushed by the average holder too. Imagine the staggering wave of initiatives that will come at the higher levels so more investment can be made. You can also join and release your own creative dreams under the Kendu umbrella and receive 24/7 engagement.

Retail and investors in general are cautious about investing due to bad actors, but IRL shows that Kendu is different. We are building something physical with real people and this is the most ultimate form of **Proof Of Humanity.**

Here are Kendu's current IRL efforts(I might be forgetting some too):

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil

* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT

* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!

* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida

* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!

* Kendu Jewellery

* Kendu Beer

* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks it will be available on Steam and 15% of the profits will be used to buy Kendu for their treasury. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games!

* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )

* Murals - Spray painted art

My name is Lloyd. I wanted to get this story off my chest. It happened so many years ago and I felt like it was time to tell it while I’m still breathing. I live in a nursing home so I got nothing better to do anyway. In 1976 my friend Stan went missing. He had been a close friend of mine since school and I considered him to be one of the best men I had ever known in my life. He was kind, thoughtful, intelligent and had good taste in music. We used to spend hours listening to Black Sabbath after school smoking cigarettes. Those were good times. 

Then in 1970 Stan was unfortunately drafted. The Vietnam war was in full swing by that time and he was eligible. Every young man in our town feared the draft. I begged God at times to keep my name from being pulled. Stories had spread about the atrocities being committed over there and I wanted no part of it. I never would have thought it’d be someone like Stan who’d get sent over. We were both only nineteen at the time. I didn’t see him for a long time after that. When he did return he was missing his left arm and his spirit.

My father said it was something called shellshock that was afflicting him, but at the time I had little knowledge about it. Stan had withdrawn into himself. He drank like there was no tomorrow and fell into despair. I tried to help him but Stan would refuse anytime I tried. He pushed everyone away. He eventually left town for a while, but he returned in January 1976. This is when everything slowly began.

By this point I was working as a bartender at a place called The Peculiar Platypus (odd name I know.). I was twenty five by this point and life had been going well. I had a girlfriend named Michelle and I was thinking about proposing soon. I’d been working longer shifts to save up for a ring. Then one day in January on Saturday the 31st Stan entered the bar. 

It was near closing. Stan had been in town for two weeks. There had been some whispers here and there. With all his mental issues he seemed to be a bit of a town pariah and with his recent return people had been uneasy. I knew about it but I hadn’t really talked to him yet since he returned. It was all still a little awkward. But he approached me that day, sat at the bar and said in a friendly but almost hopeless voice “Hey, long time no see.”

I smiled politely but I was worried. “Hey Stan. Good to see you.”

“Can I grab a VB?”

“Sure” I said, pouring him one. He took the freshly poured beer and took a long swig. He looked thinner. His eyes were dark with exhaustion, like he was constantly fighting an unending battle in his head. 

“I …” Stan started. “I just wanted to say sorry. For everything. For how I was before I left. I’m sorry I was such an asshole.”

Stan started to cry but he forced his tears to go away before taking another big swig of the beer. I regretted pouring it for him. Alcohol was the last thing he needed, even if it was my job to pour it for him. 

“I don’t really know why I came back here. I could feel something. Something calling me. It’s like there's a string on my soul tugging me towards …”
He stopped, like he was pondering something of great importance. “

“Towards what?” I asked.

He shook his head and finished his beer. “Nothing. Sorry. I’m just acting like a damn fool. Goodbye Lloyd.”

Then he left. I was very worried. His words didn’t sound like they were for a friendly reunion. Those words sounded like a final goodbye. I called my cousin Paul, who was a cop. It was a small town and I asked if he could send someone to keep an eye out for Stan just to make sure he was safe. 

Paul said over the phone “Of course. It's not the first time we’ve worried about Stan like this. I’ll have Norman do a drive around town. Maybe he will spot him.”

I thanked Paul and went back to my shift. The next morning I was asleep in bed when Michelle woke me up. “Phones ringing for you.”

I got up and answered. “Lloyd? Hey, it's Paul again. Just wanted to follow up on Stan last night.”

“Yeah sure, go ahead.”

“Well, we never found any sign of him. He’s disappeared. He was apparently staying with his parents and they said they haven't seen him since last night.”

Things quickly progressed after that. After telling the police and Paul about Stan's behaviour the night before they began to rally up a search party. Only six people volunteered to assist the search.. A part of me has always been a little resentful at the lack of effort our town put into finding Stan. We were put into pairs. Stan's father and uncle were one pair. Grant Harlow (our old mathematics teacher) and Edward Foreman (the town's mechanic) were another pair. 

The last pair was myself and a man named Trevor Redwood. He was a nice man only a year or two younger than me. Some folk in town weren’t nice to him and I knew he had some sort of mental or intellectual disability, but he never bothered me. I knew he loved to paint and I had actually seen his work once in the town hall. He was really good at painting landscapes, usually taking inspiration from places in the area. He was always proud of his work and I felt like if the world was a nicer place he’d have been famous. 

Along with the volunteers there were roughly eight policemen who were forced into going along with the search. Nearly all of them looked bored and uninterested. Bunch of bastards. It was February 2nd when we began the search. 

The terrain around our region was rugged and harsh. Our town was in Western Australia, a place well known for its dangerous desert landscapes. The police claimed they didn’t have access to a helicopter due to budget constraints so we were going on foot. I drove out to a section labelled on a map which Paul had provided to me. All around us was the long expanse of orange desert. 

We packed plenty of gear for the trip. Water, ropes, radio, flares, first aid kits and flashlights. I also brought my father’s revolver and twelve rounds of ammunition. I didn’t expect to use it but various wildlife existed in these parts. Snakes, Dingos, Foxes and more lingered around the area so it was worth it to have something to scare them off with. Trevor had his hunting rifle which he strapped to his back.

I marked on the map where we left the car and headed into the desert to look around. I made sure to park near a particularly large rock so I knew how to get back. It was shaped like a finger pointing upwards. It was kinda unnerving to look at. 

The day went by without much fuss but I was certainly worried about Stan. At the time I was feeling guilty. I should have done more to stop him, and now he was possibly missing in the unbearable heat. Trevor seemed to be in positive spirits at least. He’d often check in and see how I was doing.

“Don’t worry, we will find Stan.” Trevor said with a smile “He’ll be right as rain.”

At around three pm we were starting to feel less optimistic. We hadn’t seen any tracks or evidence of Stan being in the area. We hadn’t heard much chatter over the radio either. I was losing hope. Maybe he had just run out of town? Maybe he was fine?

Then Trevor noticed the cave. He pointed it out saying “Maybe he went in there for shelter?”
“Maybe” I replied “Come on, lets have a look”
We began moving into the cave itself. I raised my flashlight and looked in. There was a pathway that led down into an unknowable darkness. It led so far down that my torch couldn’t cover the whole cave. Trevor stepped forward a little but I stopped him.

“Wait, the cave might not be safe. I’ll scout ahead with the flares. Try and brighten this place up.”

“Good idea.”

 I walked ahead into the dark, leaving flares behind me every now and then so the path would be lit up. Trevor waited patiently at the cave's entrance. Eventually I lost sight of him the further in I went. As I made my way inside I noticed the bones of small animals on the floor. They snapped underneath my feet, making me feel ill. Further along I noticed something. A piece of paper. I approached it and picked it up. The note was written by Stan.

It read “It’s over. The whispers brought me here. It told me it’d make the pain stop. Make the agony stop. The phantom pain in my arm and the agony of my memories would cease. I leave this here on the chance someone finds it. Leave me be. Let me rest. Stan Jones, 1976.”

I swore and rushed blindly into the dark. Something about this place was horribly wrong and my old friend had clearly had some kind of breakdown. I had to get him out of that place. I owed him that much. The pathway led further in and I noticed cobwebs covering the walls. I had to push through them hoping to god none of the webs were made by Redback spiders. If they were, I'd be dead before help could get to me. I pushed further in and found myself in a large chamber. That's when I saw it.

The web that covered the walls of this place was filled with skeletons, mummified and dried out in the heat. Bones of humans and animals covered the floor along with tattered pieces of clothing. The room smelt of death and hunger. It didn’t take long to see Stan stuck to the wall. I rushed over to him and tried to pull the webs off him. But he was dead. His eyes were closed but he was smiling. He looked content with his fate, his pain vanished. Anger, guilt and grief exploded in my heart. That feeling dulled over the decades, but I never truly healed from it. It was always there haunting me.

As I inspected him I saw something. There was a puncture mark on his arm where something large had bitten him, but the bite was too large for a normal sized spider. Whatever it was, it was huge. Black venom spiraled into Stan's dead veins. I knew then that there was something truly unnatural happening in this place. Then a glob of disgusting slime brushed my shoulder and I looked up.

I was somewhere else. I was at Stan's house listening to Black Sabbath's Paranoid album. He was due to be shipped out the next day, but at that moment it was just us listening to the music. I wanted to tell him to stay, to run away from the army. I wanted us to stay like we were in this moment. Just two friends sharing the music.

A loud BANG woke me up from my stupor. I stumbled backwards realising I had been in some sort of trance. I looked up and remembered. A gigantic beast stood above me clinging to the webs. It had hundreds of eyes, black hair and multiple legs. The spiderlike creature shrieked and I saw Trevor at the entrance of the chamber. He looked at me yelling “Lloyd, get up!” before he fired another shot. BANG. 

The second shot missed and the large spider pounced near me. The vision it entranced me with still lingered in my mind, making me feel groggy. I reached to my side and took out the revolver. I fired multiple times. BANG, BANG, BANG. I ruptured one of its eyes but the other shots missed completely. I couldn’t keep my hands steady. It screeched and I could almost hear it speak. “Hungry…” it muttered in a foul voice.

“Get up!” Trevor begged, firing one more shot. BANG. It hit the monster in the mouth forcing it backwards in pain. Then Trevor grabbed my shoulder and dragged me out of the chamber. He was my saviour and I was indebted to him for the rest of my life. We barely made it out of that place alive. Once we were out we used the radio to call everyone. When they came Paul thought we were tripping on acid.

We led the entire party into the caves but the monster was gone. All that remained were the webs, the bones and Stan. Paul never believed our story, thinking we were scared in the dark. He thought, with everything going on, that we had probably exaggerated the severity of the situation. I didn’t care. I just wanted to get Stan's body out of there and go home before that thing came back. The only ones who believed me were Stan’s father and uncle. They were both heartbroken.

I never found out how it contacted Stan. Judging from the fact that the monster could somehow infect peoples minds I imagined that it must've had some sort of powerful telepathy. It must've spoken to him, promising euphoria and an end to his pain. But in the end it consumed him. 

Years went by and I stayed in town waiting for signs of that creature, but none came. I hoped it died somewhere out there in the desert, boiling to death under the sun. My life afterwards was good. I had two sons with Michelle and ended up buying the bar I worked at. Paul continued working with the police. He passed away last year. Trevor did well for himself and we’d occasionally catch up for the odd coffee or two every now and then. He had a son named Ted who grew to be a respectable man. Sometimes he goes hunting and I pray that he never runs into any spiders.

And that's the story. It was so long ago now and I just wanted to tell it. Nobody is gonna believe it and I don’t really care. I’m old and I could drop dead one of these days so I figured someone might enjoy it. Word of advice, if your friends are struggling please check in with them. If you’re struggling, try talking to someone. And lastly, if you hear someone beckoning you into the desert offering you peace and elation, just ignore it. So long.

1ncgj7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfyChair/comments/1ncgj7g/why_are_ergonomic_chairs_so_expensive/,Why are ergonomic chairs so expensive?,"When people first start shopping for ergonomic chairs, the sticker shock is real. You’ll see models creeping into the $500–$1,500 range and wonder how on earth a place to sit can cost as much as a laptop. I’ve been working in workplace design for a while now, and I’ve spent a lot of time researching, testing, and even helping spec chairs for offices. The short answer is: you’re not just paying for “a chair,” you’re paying for engineering, materials, and long-term health outcomes. Let me break it down.

**1. Engineering and design**  
Ergonomic chairs are not just random padded seats. The big-name models—think Herman Miller Aeron, Steelcase Leap, Humanscale Freedom—are the result of years (sometimes decades) of research and development. These companies employ ergonomists, industrial designers, and medical consultants who study how the body sits, moves, and fatigues. They run trials, test pressure points, and refine designs. That R&D doesn’t come cheap, but it’s the reason those chairs feel like they “disappear” under you compared to a $99 office chair from a big box store.

**2. Adjustability and mechanics**  
A good ergonomic chair doesn’t just tilt back and forth. It offers micro-adjustments: seat depth, lumbar support, armrest height and angle, tilt tension, recline limiters, forward tilt, etc. Each of these requires precision mechanics—gears, levers, gas cylinders—that don’t wobble after a year. Cheaper chairs either skip these features or include them in a way that feels clunky and wears out fast. Think of it like comparing a $20 watch to a Swiss timepiece: both tell time, but one will last 20 years with smooth mechanics and the other won’t survive a hard bump.

**3. Materials and durability**  
High-end ergonomic chairs are built to handle daily use for a decade or more. The mesh doesn’t sag, the foam doesn’t pancake, the casters roll smoothly even after thousands of hours. That durability is why many of these companies offer 10–12 year warranties. The initial cost is high, but when you spread it over 10 years of daily sitting, it’s often cheaper than replacing a $200 chair every 18–24 months (and destroying your back in the process).

**4. Health and productivity**  
This is the part most people overlook. A poorly designed chair can contribute to back pain, neck strain, carpal tunnel issues, and long-term posture damage. An ergonomic chair isn’t a luxury—it’s a preventative health tool. If you sit 6–8 hours a day, it’s literally the piece of equipment you use most in your life, second only to your mattress. Paying for comfort and spinal support isn’t just about “feeling fancy,” it’s about reducing fatigue and avoiding medical bills later.

**5. Brand and resale value**  
Yes, there’s some brand markup, but unlike fashion brands, ergonomic chair companies often back that price with warranty and service. Fun fact: used Herman Miller and Steelcase chairs regularly resell for $400–$600 even after years of use, because people know they’re still solid. Try reselling an IKEA chair after two years—you’ll be lucky if someone takes it for free.

**My personal take**  
I used to sit on a $150 “executive chair” from an office store. Within a year, the padding was flat, the tilt was broken, and I had constant lower back pain. I finally bit the bullet on a Steelcase Leap about 7 years ago, and it’s been night and day. The chair looks and feels the same as the day I bought it, and my back pain is basically gone. If I average the cost over the years, it’s been cheaper per day than a cup of coffee.

**Bottom line:** ergonomic chairs are expensive because they’re precision tools designed for health, durability, and comfort over the long haul. If you’re spending hours sitting every day, it’s one of the best investments you can make in yourself.",1,1757418032.0,ComfyChair,0,1.0,False

When my digestion feels off, I’m more tired, irritable, and less patient with my kids. I never really thought about probiotics, fiber, or even stress management as part of gut health until recently.



I’ve started adding more veggies, water, and yogurt into my diet, and it’s helping little by little. But I know I still have a long way to go especially since I tend to rely on coffee and quick meals when life gets busy.

1ncgfzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1ncgfzo/the_man_from_orașalpieiriimade_part_1/,The Man from Oraș-al-Pieiriimade [Part 1],"“Here comes Ninny with Mr. Bumblefuck, Transylvania.” Diane elbowed Mary—the two of them were waiting at the bar—and pointed toward the entrance.



“Be nice,” Mary said, trying to sound reproachful, even as her eyes glistened above a wide-reaching grin.



Nina, one of the “Besties Four,” and frankly, the lowest on their quartet’s totem pole, was bringing her fiancé to meet the other three. Nina’s beau, Albert, was a milk-skinned foundling, prize-of-the-orphanage sort. One of those foreigners, either too provincial to know he was good-looking, or playacting at love to snag an American rich bitch (that was Diane’s thinking, at any rate).



Albert. The tall drink of Transylvanian water, whose dark, dark Svengali eyes had entranced Nina, as had his mellifluous voice of razor-thin Eastern-European inflection. But he sounded just foreign enough to play the heel in a fairy tale.



Their introductory dinner quickly derailed. Diane asked Albert if he’d ever used an indoor toilet before, if he thought chicken tasted better than mountain goats, if he was related to Béla Lugosi.



“Béla Lugosi was from Hungary,” Albert politely answered. 



Diane, already drunk, practically sneered. “You said you’re from Bucharest.” 



“You’re thinking of Budapest. Budapest is in Hungary, Bucharest in Romania.” 



Diane scoffed. “Well, none of it’s Paris, is it?”



Mary asked, “Why’d you come to America?” 



“Don’t be *rude*,” Nina said. 



“It’s a fair question,” Mary shot back, vodka martini and lemon twist held like Lady Justice’s scales of judgment.



Before Albert could answer, the Queen Bee of the outfit arrived. Eve. She walked into the restaurant looking down her nose, eyes advertising disdain. Her heels added height to a woman already taller than most men. The table hushed at her arrival. An absent diamond ring left a ghost of pale skin around her ring finger. Eve saw Albert and clucked in disgust. 



That was the first time Nina introduced her fiancé to her friends.



•



*To reap the harvest, sow the fields. Bring dirt by the shovelful, even. Patience, boy. It takes patience to build an empire from loam. An artisan hand, to sculpt from clay a kingdom’s furrows. To make beauty out of bedrock, turn barren sediment into life.* 

*Scatter your seed, and you shall grow into their world. Old weaknesses will die, new ones arise. The fertilized stalks, thirstless, will reach for the sun from fresh-ploughed rows. And then you can decide if you want to be good the same way they are “good”.*

Nina returned from girls’ night in tears. Albert listened to her recount how her friends, plenty sauced after unwinding at The Spa at the Mandarin Oriental, told everyone within spitting distance of the bar about an especially ignorant species of rube called Albert: Who learned to drive on a donkey. Who didn’t know the difference between goats and women. Who once worked at Dracula’s castle, baking blood into bread, fattening up dungeon-kept virgins.



“I tried to grin and bear it,” she told Albert as he spooned her in bed. “Then, I knew I’d—I knew it was the wrong tactic. I spent hours not defending you. I felt cheap, but I still said nothing. It was…it was like I was trapped in my own mistake. Why are they so mean?” She quietly cried. “Sometimes I wonder if they’re really my friends.” 



Albert kept silent vigil, his breath on her neck a quiet heat of solidarity. But he didn’t tell her she was wrong. *With friends like these…*



Once Nina was asleep, Albert went to the bathroom to get ready for bed. He closed the door carefully, letting the latch click so quietly it could’ve been the sound of a stiff ankle joint. He pressed the pin in the doorknob to lock it.



Albert took a deep breath and held. He stiffened his middle finger and pushed it against his sternum. He pressed. Pressed and pressed till the finger was inside flesh. He hooked his finger. Hooked and pulled, hooked and pulled, until he’d corkscrewed deep under his skin. 



There was no blood. No muscle strands or fascia. Only a squirming, tubular sphincter, made of matter like intestinal mucosa. A mouth opened and closed like fish lips around a black crevice. Albert looked in the mirror, watching the hungry sinkhole open and close.



He picked up the wastepaper basket next to the toilet. He fished out Nina’s used tampons. He gathered her ceruminous Q-Tips. He rooted around until he found a used Bandaid and the skin off a hangnail. Albert fed it all into his chest. Dead cells, secretions. He moaned. The hungry hole inside him ate his beloved’s bodily refuse.



•



Eve called Nina to cancel the girls’ monthly brunch. Diane was caring for her father, who’d just had a heart attack, Eve said. 



“It’s a bit heartless to expect Diane to grin and bear it while her daddy still has tubes in his chest, don’t you think?” Eve asked. 



“Maybe I should call…?” Nina wondered aloud.



“Only if you want her mortified by pity. If you talk to her, don’t even mention it.”



Nina decided she’d use her freed up time to take Albert to Veselka’s in the East Village. But while off to sample pierogies and borscht, Nina saw Mary, Diane, and Eve laughing and sipping mimosas inside of the restaurant where Eve had “cancelled” their brunch. From inside, Mary locked eyes with Albert. Nina didn’t see.



Albert said nothing as he and Nina trekked on in pursuit of their own vittles.



Once seated at Veselka’s, Nina’s eyes were glued to the table. She was almost catatonic. Albert stared at the uneaten pierogies on her plate like they were bite-sized trolls accusing him of poor caretaking. He couldn’t persuade Nina to eat. He couldn’t get her to talk. The whole thing was a wash.



After he paid the bill, Albert put Nina in a cab. “I’m just going to stop and get something, and then I’ll meet you at home. Okay?” 



Nina nodded but said nothing. 



Albert watched the cab drive away. Worry over Nina needled him. He was surprised by the strength of his feelings for her. But wasn’t he warned of that? Romance, that most intoxicating of human lies.



Did he love her? He must have, for all his worrying. He was sick with it, infected with it, his anxiety a rabid animal sinking its jaws into him. 



This was a big city. This wasn’t a safe place. 



He reminded himself that Nina was born here, grew up here. He told himself that he respected her enough not to treat her like a child. Albert’s father had done that to his mother. Kept her chained up on full moons, bathed her in leeches when his mother returned from Witches’ Sabbaths.



Still, he worried about Nina.



Then again, this place wasn’t like his home. His home, where the weak hadn’t enough time to die of starvation before they themselves were eaten. Where nothing was soft, and everything was teeth and talons. Oraș-al-Pieiriimade was a city of death, a place whose residents made New York’s most dangerous criminals seem like pillow-fighting school girls in comparison.



Yes, Nina would be fine on her own. Just for a little bit.



Albert walked three blocks over and one block up from Veselka’s. Yes, this had to be it. Stairs leading down into the shop, a purple crescent moon hanging from the awning. Here was the store the fellow at St. Dumitru warned him off, probably thinking Albert was another Christer. Albert walked down the steps and inside.



He approached the register and asked the multiply-punctured waif of a girl at the counter, “Who do I talk to about special orders?”



•



It was a month later. Albert was off meeting a friend in FiDi. Nina was glad he was out of the house when she tossed her lunch. She was sick as a dog.



Nina cleaned herself up and went to Duane Reade. She bought a pregnancy test. 



Back at home, Nina locked the bathroom door before urinating on the First Response tester. She looked down at the stick. To her it resembled a closed travel toothbrush. She wondered how many people had ever peed on travel toothbrushes. Then, she questioned her state of mind that led her to wonder about people peeing on toothbrushes. Then, she wondered what other toiletries people soiled. A gay friend at college named Emory—Emory was the friend’s name, not the school’s—told Nina that he shoved a shampoo bottle up his ass. What Emory had done with toothbrushes?, she wondered. Had he also stuck Q-Tips in his urethra, slathered Vicks VapoRub on his testicles? Had Emory tried that “figging” thing—shoving a peeled ginger root right up the ass—they’d learned about in their Victorian Sexualities class? She vaguely recalled that it was a punishment for slaves in Ancient Greece, too.



Why was she thinking like this? Perverse thoughts impinging on a question of fertility. It made her ashamed, but she didn’t know why. She remembered the pregnancy test. Nina looked down at the test stick. There were two lines.



“I’m pregnant,” she told herself, making it real. 



Her shame was immediately forgotten.



Was that so strange?

•



Mary was actually happy she ran into Albert. They sat and spoke over a few cups of coffee. 



“It was a mistake. I *love* Nina. She’s like my sister. Closer than my sister, really. It’s just Eve…” Mary sighed.



Albert did something Mary didn’t expect. He touched her hand. Not like a lecher, like an elderly uncle. Still, it felt electric to her.



“I understand,” he said. “It’s difficult. With girls who grow up together—there are certain…*dynamics* at play.” 



“Exactly,” Mary said. She had a strange urge to turn her hand palm-up and hold Albert’s. But he pulled away. Albert looked out the window. His gaze was watery, unfocused. A thousand-yard stare.



Mary tried to draw his attention back to her. “It’s almost like we’re too close, you know? Summers on Long Island, everyone at Horace Mann together, staying in the city for college. People like us,” Mary whispered, ever wary of eavesdroppers, “we’re provincial in our own way. We’re all a little too much alike. It’s funny, you’d think in a city this big, there’d be more than enough room for everybody. But the circles we run in can feel a little…claustrophobic. And Eve…Eve can just be mean. Especially with the divorce she’s going through. She’s…embittered.”



Albert nodded as Mary spoke. “I don’t want to be the bone of contention. Maybe there’s a concern that I’m trying to change Nina, or take her away from you—her friends. But that’s not true at all, I promise you. I just want to be a good husband, and help if I can. I know that you—and Diane, and Eve—are *very* important to her.”



Mary cleared her throat. “I’m sorry, did you—did you say *husband*?”



“Yes,” Albert answered, “we eloped.”



“Oh…” Mary said, then repeated, “oh…” 



Albert gave her a queer look; a suspicious look. 



“That’s—I mean, that’s *wonderful*,” Mary said. “Really. Really, it is. I’m so happy for the two of you.” Mary reached out for Albert’s hand again, hardly aware she was doing it. But Albert pulled back before she could reach him.



They spoke a little while longer. Then Mary left. Albert stayed behind, leisurely sipping his coffee, waiting until Mary left. When he was sure she was gone, Albert leaned over and plucked a stray hair she’d left on her seat. He put it in his pocket. 



Then he left, too.



•



Diane, now out of the shower, put her earrings back in and got dressed. Her liaison, Bater Pullman—an unfortunate but real name—asked, “You don’t have time for lunch?” 



Diane, dropping her cellphone and wallet back in her Hermès purse, answered, “I’ll tell you what. Once you’re not the club tennis pro, I’ll be seen in public with you.” 



“Okay.” Bater tried not to appear gutted. He’d been trying for years to get Diane to dinner, but the best he could do was bed her. He’d gotten it ass-backwards—was upset about it, to boot. “But you’ll call me?” 



Diane rolled her eyes. “I’ll see you at the club. Same as usual. If you don’t bother me there, we’ll do this again. And Bater?”



“Yeah?” 



“It’s cologne, not soap. You don’t need to work up a lather.”



Diane left The Pierre. She’d only just turned to head home when she heard a noise. It sounded like rushing rapids, a deluge of wood and metal and heavy flesh. She turned toward the source of it, in the direction of Grand Army Plaza. Rushing headlong toward her were three horse-drawn carriages. 



Time slowed. Diane could see debris flying up around muscled legs, hooves and horseshoes pounding like hammers breaking pavement and sending pieces of it leaping into the air like tarmac fleas. Mist sprayed from the horses’ noses. It looked like smoke from a fire in their muzzles. 



The first draft horse was a behemoth coming to steamroll her, galloping like lightning strikes, its eyes wild, stupid and frightened. Diane squeezed her eyes shut and prepared for death. There was a collision that sounded like a shipping container of ground beef dropped from atop the Empire State Building. She was sure she was dead.  



Diane opened her eyes. She looked around, trying to make sense of the scene. A city bus had smashed into the first horse and carriage before it could run her down. One of the other two carriages’ horses had impaled its neck trying to jump a hot dog stand. Blood gushed from the hole where the Sabrett umbrella speared the horse's throat. A chunk of bone sat on the umbrella’s ferrule at the tip like a tiny hat glazed in strawberry jam.



The third draft horse’s driver was slowing it to a trot at the periphery of Central Park.



Bewildered, Diane started to piece together what had happened. Something had spooked the horses, sent them stampeding from their road-apple-ringed staging area. She looked that way, to Grand Army Plaza, and saw something her brain had a hard time reckoning: Albert, coming her way, from the spot where the horses first broke loose, following the path of blood and chaos like an echo of the stampede, walking toward her with a menacing smile on his face. 



Then, she lost sight of Albert in the sea of injured riders and panicked bystanders, the crowd writhing like living panic.



Diane felt something yank, hard. A sharp pain pierced the crown of her skull. She spun around, looking for an assailant, but there was no one close enough who could’ve been the likely suspect. She reached up and touched her head. It burned with pain at her touch. She hissed and pulled her hand away. Diane winced, looked down at her fingertips. She saw blood.



•

He always got so hungry at night. Why did he get so hungry at night? He was like one of those fat guys who never in front of anyone but stuffed his piehole with Funyuns and HoHos the second he got home. 



Albert pulled the rope of hair out of his pocket. A patch of skin anchored the strands, blood hardened on the underside like frozen, red roots. He laid it on the bathroom counter in front of him. 



Albert rummaged through the vanity’s drawers till he found Nina’s eyelash curler. He clamped the curler down on his right eyelid, using it to pull his eyelid open as far as he could. 



He took Diane’s hair and used his fingers to push it into the palpebral fissure of his open eye. Nodes rose all over Albert’s face. The bumps looked like they were breathing, inflating and deflating; pumping bellows on a ventilator. The hair was sucked past the canthus of his eyelids, like long runs of vermicelli being slurped up by a trattoria’s starving last patron. Albert’s eye sucked the jigsaw piece of flesh holding Diane’s hair into it.



•



*You will bleed like them. Be careful of that, for life is in the blood. And remember the anchor is only that: a weighted chain that drags you, newly made flesh and blood, into their world. If you think of it as anything else, you will risk yourself to protect it, defeating its purpose.*



•



Eve sat across from her divorce attorney Matvey Brunfeld. She guzzled riesling and looked over the Cipriani Dolci menu. 



“Why do we always meet here?” Eve asked.



Brunfeld looked up from the menu. “Because you won’t come to my office, Evie. And I don’t like going out. So, we compromise by going to a restaurant that neither of us enjoy.”



Eve laughed. “Brunie.” She swished the wine around her glass and said, “So, tell me, how bad is it?” 



“Big picture or discovery?” 



“Start with discovery.”



“They have some very unflattering text messages,” Brunfeld said, clinking the ice cubes melting in his Lagavulin against the side of the glass. “And pictures.” 



Eve groaned. 



“Honestly, Evie, it’s not good. Between that, the arrest, the order of protection…I think custody is a stretch,” Brunfeld said. 



“But she hit *me* first,” Eve protested. 



“Yes, I understand that. It’s just that self-defense against your ten-year-old daughter is a hard pill for family court to swallow.”



“What can we do? I can’t let him win, Brunie. He’s a fucker. A *fucker*.”



Brunfeld was wondering how long he could continue in trusts and estates before he started bleeding inside his stomach when he saw someone he recognized. Brunfeld waved. 



Eve turned around to see who her attorney was waving at. It was Albert. “How do you know Albert?” 



“Hmm?” 



Eve huffed, impatient. “The man you just waved at.” 



“Oh, right. Mr. Mâncsângek is a client of the firm,” Brunfeld said. “Charming man. You know him?”  



Eve strained her long neck to look over at Albert’s table. “I’ve met him once,” she said, “but that’s it. He’s an Eastern Bloc bumpkin, isn’t he?” 



Brunfeld laughed. “It sounded like you’ve never actually spoken with him.”



“Sure I have. Nina Dolleschall brought him out to dinner with us—with the girls. He’s engaged to her.”



“Correction,” Brunfeld said as he lifted his glass, “Albert and Nina Mâncsângek are now married.” He took a swig. 



“Married?” Eve scoffed. She didn’t believe it.  



“Yes.”



“How would *you* know?”



“He and Nina were in our firm last week for a post-nup, and estate planning.” 



“How the hell can Albert afford to use *your* firm?” Eve asked.



“You surprise me, Evie. You’re usually in the know.” 



“I know enough to know he’s a peasant. He probably grew up pinching cow teats and eating uncooked potatoes off the end of a knife.” 



“Oh God.” Brunfeld shook his head. “You know, when you’re wrong, you really make it count.”



“What do you mean?” 



“Mâncsângek is worth a hundred and seventy million dollars. Conservatively.” Brunfeld cocked his head. “He’s coming over.” 



As Albert walked toward them, Eve was trying to understand how he could be wealthier than her. Albert opened doors for people. She’d seen it. Was this what her class had come to? An upper crust of fund managers, corporate executives, and…doormen?



This new understanding of Albert’s circumstance suddenly made Eve nervous about her appearance. But that was ridiculous, wasn’t it? He was a *rube*, wasn’t he? How was this possible? She thought to pull out her compact and check her appearance, but there was no time. Albert was already at their table, Brunfeld already standing to extend his hand, which Albert shook. 



“Mr. Mâncsângek, a pleasure to see you again,” Brunfeld said. 



Albert palmed Brunfeld’s hands from both sides, and gave the attorney a Clintonian two-handed shake. “Matvey, the pleasure is all mine,” Albert said. “And I hear congratulations are in order.” 



“Sorry?” Brunfeld looked confused. 



“Your daughter’s acceptance to Dartmouth. Very good school, Brunie. Do you mind if I call you Brunie? I heard them say it at the office.” 



Albert was lying; no one at Brunfeld’s office called him Brunie. It was a small pool of well-moneyed brats who used that pet name. But Brunfeld was too flattered to reason that out.



“Of course,” Brunfeld said, now shaking Albert’s hand vigorously. 



Albert looked down and saw Eve. “Mrs. Bechtel, a pleasure to see you again.” 



“Not Bechtel for long, right Evie? Last name switches back to Holland, soon, right?” Brunfeld said. 



“Oh, you’re getting divorced,” Albert said as he let go of Brunfeld’s hand. “I’m sorry to hear that, Eve.” He affected a pout. Eve took it to be passive-aggressive. 



“It’s fine, *Albert*,” Eve muttered. 



His congeniality, his obvious acceptance into social circles she was slowly being pushed from, irked her to no end. And Brunie’s mention of her maiden name’s reclamation felt intrusive. The idea that this backwater *kulak* had privileged information about her was galling. 



Everything about Albert Mâncsângek bothered her. *Everything*. She wanted to punch him right in the face. 



“Listen, Brunie, I don’t want to be rude to my guest, he’s visiting from Bucharest—” 



“Should we join our tables?” Brunfeld eagerly asked. 



“I appreciate the gesture, but it would only make my guest uncomfortable,” Albert said. “His English is…rudimentary. He’s quite self-conscious about it.”



“Well, good that he has you then, huh?” Brunfeld practically ejaculated. He slapped Albert’s arm like they were old fraternity brothers. This was a groping, ingratiating side of Brunfeld she’d never seen before. Eve was sick at the display.



She scowled. “Yes, it’s very charitable of you to help a fellow countryman. I’m sure New York is a big, scary place for people who take their horse and buggy for visits to the witch doctor.” 



“Evie!” Brunfeld gasped. “That was rude.” He leaned in close to Eve and said, “You should apologize.”



“No, no, no,” Albert smiled at Eve. “Just a little friendly ribbing between friends,” he said, looking at Eve a little longer than was comfortable.



“We’re not friends,” Eve muttered, but if either Albert or Brunfeld heard her, they didn’t let on.



Albert turned back to Brunfeld. “But listen, Brunie, Nina and I are holding a little private concert—a little charity thing—at our new apartment at the Elysian Cloister—” 



“The Elysian Cloister,” Brunfeld said, “I’ve never been inside…”



“—and we’d love to have you over for the performance.” 



“Who’s playing?” Eve asked, unable to restrain herself. As it was, she could barely stop herself demanding an explanation why she wasn’t invited.



“I really shouldn’t say…” Albert said. Then he leaned in and whispered to Brunfeld.



Brunfeld’s eyes went wide and he said, “Wow. That must’ve taken some pull.” 



Eve seeing Albert tell *her* lawyer, *her* friend—maybe friend was a stretch, but the point still stood—secrets was enough to set her brain on fire. What the hell was happening? It was like the world was a snowglobe set upside down and she was watching snow rise up from the ground into the sky. Suddenly some Eastern-European hick was rubbing elbows with Manhattan’s upper crust, and she was a soon-to-be divorcée who would have to vacate her doorman building on Park Avenue once her divorce went through. The world was fucking topsy-turvy.



Red-faced, Eve blurted, “How can you even afford to live there?” 



She was mortified, and instantly regretted the outburst. What was she, a peasant whining to her magnanimous feudal lord? She could only hope she’d angered Albert so that he’d maybe embarrass himself, too.



“Mother was quite generous with her wedding gift to us,” Albert answered with a gentility that could have been taught to him by Queen Elizabeth. Eve was screaming inside herself. She wanted to toss the table over and chuck the bottle of riesling at Albert’s head.



“But really, I don’t want to be rude to my guest…” Albert said. 



“Oh, yes, yes, sorry, Mr. Mâncsângek,” Brunfeld fell over himself. The obsequious little jackal, Eve thought. 



“Please,” Albert said, placing both his hands on the shoulder pads of Brunfeld’s jacket. “Call me Al.” 



Suddenly Brunfeld was giggling like a schoolgirl. “Oh, that’s good, Mr. Mâ—sorry, *Al*. That’s good, Al.” 



“We can expect you then?” Albert asked. 



“I’ll be there with bells on,” Brunfeld beamed. 



“Very good, then.” Albert said. He came around to Eve’s seat, which she didn’t rise from, and leaned in for a hug. She was shocked. He pressed himself close and whispered in her ear, “I want to thank you for being such a good friend to Nina. If you were to hurt her again, I think she would be devastated. And I couldn’t handle that.” He pulled away and Eve felt something like an insect bite on her scalp. 



“Ow!” she yelled and jumped to her feet. “You pulled my hair!” Half the tables turned to look and see what was going on.



Brunfeld hissed through his teeth, “Evie, *enough*. You’re *embarrassing yourself*!” 



“Yes, well…I must be going.” Albert turned around and walked back to his table. 



Eve and Brunfeld sat back down. They didn’t say anything for a while. Eve drank her riesling with the indelicacy of an Oktoberfest drunk fondling a beer stein. 



“Eve…” Brunfeld finally said, finicking with his tumbler of whiskey, “that was painful.” 



“Oh, shut the fuck up, *Brunie*,” she added this last mockingly. 



They waited in silence for the check. But the check didn’t come. Instead, after their plates were cleared, a server came and told them that the bill had been “taken care of.”



“That was very generous of him. You know, he has a sort of Thomas Wayne thing about him.” Brunfeld said. 



“Never heard of him,” Eve said. 



“Bruce Wayne’s father. Batman’s.”



“Ha!” Eve’s laugh was bitter. “We should be so lucky, that your new buttbuddy gets gunned down outside the Met.”



“Eve…” Brunfeld shook his head. 



“I think you should skip the hosannas next time and go straight to licking his shoes.” 



Brunfeld took the dregs of his drink and shook his head. He stood to leave. Eve watched him, not moving an inch herself. 



“I want to know,” she said just as Brunfeld was turning to go. 



“Know what?” Brunfeld was checking his watch, obviously eager to be done with Eve for the day. 



“Tell me who’s playing his little charity show.” 



“Evie—” 



“Goddamnit Brunie, you tell me or I will make your life miserable.” 



Brunfeld sighed. “Didn’t you hear what I said? ‘Call me Al’?” 



Eve’s jaw clenched, her shoulders rigid with tension. The headache she thought she’d flushed down with wine was back, graduated from unpleasant to painful. She could hear her heartbeat between her ears. 



Brunfeld sighed. “Paul Simon.”



“He’s having Paul Simon play a private concert at his apartment?” Eve asked, incredulous. If she had a gun, she would go on a shooting spree.



“That’s what he said,” Brunfeld said. 



“Goddamn *gypsy*,” Eve said under her breath. Brunfeld spared her, pretending he didn’t hear.

I’ve been struggling a lot with loneliness and I could really use some advice.

In the past, I used to be very introverted, insecure, and even dealt with depression and a minor psychosis. Because of that, I didn’t make many friends. My financial situation is also not great, which makes it even harder.

The good news is that I’ve grown a lot—I’ve become more extroverted, I laugh, I joke, I talk more to people. But even with that progress, I still feel very lonely. I only have one really great friend, and I’m so grateful for him, but I also feel bad leaning on him too much for attention.

I’ve tried meeting people online (Facebook, chat sites, etc.), but it hasn’t worked out well. I don’t have a job, studies, or outside activities at the moment, so meeting people in person feels extra difficult.

What I’d love is to find friends here in Amsterdam—guys or girls—who are fine with enjoying the simple things in life, like taking a walk, having coffee at home, visiting a museum (I have free entrance with a Stadspas), that kind of stuff.

Do you have any advice for someone like me on how to actually make new friends here? Are there any groups, apps, or low-cost meetups in Amsterdam that you’d recommend?

Thanks a lot for reading.",6,1757417581.0,Amsterdam,11,0.71,False
1ncgdoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1ncgdoy/from_cliffside_betrayal_to_unbreakable_love/,From cliffside betrayal to unbreakable love,"My husband of five years, Mark, told me he was taking me on a romantic clifftop picnic. He poured me a glass of ch**pagne, his smile as warm as the sun. He said it was to celebrate our life together.

But as I admired the view, his hands slammed into my back. The world dissolved into a blur of sky and rock as I plunged toward the ravine below.

I woke up broken and bl**ding, just in time to hear his voice above. He wasn't alone. It was his mi**ress, Chloe.

""Is she... gone?"" she asked.

""She fell a long way,"" Mark's voice was flat, devoid of emotion. ""No one could survive that. By the time they find the body, it'll look like a tragic accident. Poor, unstable Clara, wandering too close to the edge.""

The casual cruelty of his words was worse than the impact. He had already written my obituary, crafting the narrative of my demise while leaving me to die in the storm.

A wave of despair washed over me, but then something else ignited: a white-hot, furious anger.

Just as my vision started to fade, headlights sliced through the rain. A man stepped out of a luxury car. It wasn't Mark. It was Julian Thorne, my husband's most hated rival, and the one man who might want Mark destroyed as much as I did.


Chapter 1
The first thing I registered was the pain, a blinding, razor-sharp agony that shot up my leg and exploded behind my eyes. The second was the smell of wet earth and crushed pine needles, a scent so thick it felt like I was breathing mud. My cheek was pressed against something cold and slick with rain.

I blinked, trying to clear the fog from my vision. Rain plastered my hair to my face, each drop a tiny, icy shock against my skin. Above me, through a tangle of dark branches, the sky was a bruised purple, churning with storm clouds. The world was a symphony of misery: the relentless drumming of the rain, the distant growl of thunder, and the ragged, desperate sound of my own breathing.

Then, I heard voices. His voice.

""Is she... gone?"" The other voice was female, laced with a cloying sweetness that turned my stomach. Chloe.

""She fell a long way. No one could survive that."" Mark's voice was flat, devoid of the warmth he had faked for five years. It was the voice of a man discussing a business transaction, not the wife he had just tried to mu**er.

My mind reeled, struggling to connect the dots. The clifftop picnic. The thermos of ""special"" tea that made my head swim. The sudden, brutal shove from behind. The sickening sensation of falling, the world spinning away from me as the rocks rushed up to meet me. It wasn't an accident.

*He did this. He pushed me.*

I tried to scream, to call out, but only a choked g**p escaped my lips. My throat felt raw, and a coppery taste filled my mouth. Bl**d.

""We should go,"" Chloe whined. ""Someone might see the car.""

""No one comes up here in this weather,"" Mark said, his tone dismissive. ""She's as good as dead. By the time they find the body, it'll look like a tragic accident. Poor, unstable Clara, wandering too close to the edge.""

The casual cruelty of his words was a physical blow, worse than the impact with the ground. He had already written my obituary, crafted the narrative of my demise. The loving husband, grieving for his troubled wife. Bile rose in my throat.

Their footsteps crunched on the gravel above, then faded. The sound of a car engine starting, and then the crunch of tires driving away, swallowed by the storm. They were gone. They had left me to die.

A wave of cold, black despair washed over me, so profound it almost finished what the fall had started. I lay there, letting the rain wash over me, a broken doll discarded in the woods. But then, a spark of something else ignited in the cold darkness of my soul. Rage. A white-hot, furious anger that burned away the despair. He would not win. I would not let him erase me.

Using my elbows, I began to drag myself forward, away from the base of the cliff. Every movement sent a fresh wave of agony through my body, but the rage was a stronger fuel. I crawled through the thick underbrush, sharp twigs and stones tearing at my already ruined dress. The fabric, a soft silk he'd bought me for our anniversary, was now just a tattered, mud-soaked rag.

My hand closed around something small and hard in the dirt. I pulled it free, my fingers numb with cold. It was a small wooden bird, intricately carved, its surface smooth and strangely pristine despite the mud. It felt solid and real in my palm, a small, tangible mystery in the midst of this nightmare. Without thinking, I shoved it into the pocket of my thin coat.

The storm broke in earnest. The sky opened up, and rain fell in blinding sheets. The temperature dropped, and a violent shiver wracked my body. Hypothermia was setting in. I was losing the battle. My vision began to tunnel, the edges turning gray. Just as I was about to surrender to the encroaching darkness, a pair of headlights sliced through the rain-swept trees.

The light was blinding, merciless. A sleek, black luxury car slowed to a stop on the winding road just beyond the treeline. My heart hammered against my ribs. *Did they come back? Did Mark come back to make sure I was dead?*

The driver's side door opened, and a tall figure emerged, silhouetted against the powerful beams. He moved with an unnerving grace, an apex predator annoyed by an obstacle in his path. He wasn't Mark. This man was taller, broader, his presence radiating a cold, dangerous authority.

As he stepped closer, the headlights illuminated his face. Sharp, aristocratic features, dark hair slicked back by the rain, and eyes the color of storm clouds. I knew that face. I had seen it in magazines, on financial news channels, in the furious glares Mark would direct at the television. Julian Thorne. The ruthless CEO of Thorne Industries, my husband's biggest and most hated rival.

He looked down at me, his expression a mask of cold disdain. There was no pity in his eyes, only irritation.

His l*p curled into a sneer of recognition. ""Well, well. Clara Vance. Looks like your husband's games finally caught up with you.""

He took in my broken state, the bl**d, the mud, the terror in my eyes, and his expression didn't soften. He looked as if he was enjoying the sight. He turned, his hand reaching for his car door, ready to leave me to my fate.

Panic, raw and primal, surged through me. With the last ounce of strength I possessed, I lunged, my fingers closing around the fine leather of his expensive shoe, grabbing his ankle. My touch was a desperate, muddy stain on his perfection.

He froze, looking down at my hand as if it were a snake.

""Please,"" I gasped, the word tearing from my throat. My eyes, wide with terror, locked onto his. ""He tried to k**l me.""

The raw, undeniable fear in my voice seemed to cut through his icy composure. His hand froze on the car door. He stood there, caught between his deep-seated hatred for my husband and the horrifying, bleeding evidence of a crime right at his feet. The storm raged around us, a fitting backdrop for the moment my life was placed in the hands of my enemy.


Chapter 2
Julian Thorne stared down at me for a long moment, his face unreadable in the flashing glare of the headlights. The rain dripped from the sharp line of his jaw. I could feel the tension in his ankle, the rigid set of his muscles beneath my desperate grip. He was weighing his options, calculating the risk versus the reward.

Finally, with a curse muttered under his breath, he bent down. He didn't offer a hand; he simply grabbed me under the arms, his grip strong and impersonal, and hauled me to my feet. A scream of pain tore from my lips as my broken leg protested, and the world tilted violently. He half-dragged, half-carried me to the passenger side of the car, his movements efficient and devoid of any gentleness.

He opened the door and practically dropped me into the plush leather seat. The interior of the car smelled of rich leather and a faint, clean scent of expensive cologne. It was a world away from the mud and rain I had just been dying in. The warmth of the car's heater was a shocking, painful pleasure against my frozen skin.

He slammed the door shut, walked around the car, and slid into the driver's seat. He didn't look at me. He just stared straight ahead through the rain-lashed windshield, his hands gripping the steering wheel so tightly his knuckles were white.

""I'm taking you to the nearest hospital,"" he said, his voice a low, hard rumble. ""I'll drop you at the emergency entrance and wash my hands of this. I don't get involved in the domestic squabbles of my enemies.""

His words were like shards of ice. He wasn't saving me; he was disposing of a problem. I was an inconvenience, a messy complication in his otherwise orderly, ruthless world. I huddled in the seat, shivering uncontrollably, the fine leather sticking to my wet, torn clothes. I was a mess of bl**d and mud in his pristine sanctuary.

As he pulled the car smoothly onto the road, the motion jostled my coat pocket. My cracked phone, which I'd thought was lost or destroyed, lit up. The screen was a spiderweb of fractures, but a single text message was visible. It was from an unknown number.

My fingers trembled as I tapped the notification. The message was short, chilling.

*He knows you're alive. They're hunting you. Trust no one.*

A fresh wave of terror, colder and sharper than the rain, washed over me. This wasn't over. Mark knew I had survived. He wouldn't just let me go to the police. He would come for me. He would finish the job. The message confirmed it: I wasn't just escaping a bad husband; I was being actively hunted.

""Who are you texting?"" Julian's voice cut through my panic. His eyes flickered from the road to my phone, his expression suspicious.

""No one,"" I whispered, my thumb quickly deleting the message. My heart was pounding a frantic rhythm against my ribs. *Trust no one.* Did that include the man sitting next to me? My husband's greatest enemy?

He didn't press, but I could feel his distrust radiating across the small space. We drove in silence for what felt like an eternity, the only sounds the rhythmic swish of the windshield wipers and the hum of the powerful engine. I watched the lights of Veridia grow closer, a glittering, indifferent sprawl in the stormy darkness.

But we didn't head toward the city center where the main hospital was. Julian took a series of sharp turns, heading toward the exclusive, high-security district overlooking the bay. He pulled into the private underground garage of a sleek, modern skyscraper that pierced the clouds.

""This isn't a hospital,"" I said, my voice barely a wh**per.

""Observant,"" he replied dryly, killing the engine. The sudden silence was deafening. ""Your husband is a very powerful, very well-connected man, Mrs. Vance. The moment I left you at Veridia General, he would have been notified. He's already reported you missing. Told the police you were distraught, mentally unstable. Suicidal.""

The word hit me like a s**p. He was painting me as crazy, laying the groundwork to have me discredited, or worse, committed.

""If you go to a public hospital,"" Julian continued, turning to look at me for the first time, his gray eyes boring into mine, ""you'll be sedated, institutionalized, and handed right back to him on a silver platter. Congratulations. You've just become a prisoner in my home. It's a gilded cage, but a cage nonetheless.""

He led me to a private elevator that opened directly into a sprawling penthouse apartment. The space was magnificent and sterile, all glass and chrome and shades of gray. Floor-to-ceiling windows revealed a breathtaking, rain-swept view of Veridia. It felt less like a home and more like a corporate headquarters. Cold, beautiful, and utterly impersonal.

A man in a crisp suit, Dr. Evans, was waiting for us. He had a kind face but professional, distant eyes. He treated my injuries in a state-of-the-art medical suite that was better equipped than most clinics. He set my leg, stitched the gash on my forehead, and cleaned my countless cuts and bruises with an efficient, detached air. Julian stood in the doorway the entire time, watching, his arms crossed over his ch**t, a silent, intimidating sentinel.

Once the doctor was gone, Julian handed me a set of clean clothes—a simple gray sweatsuit that felt sinfully soft against my bruised skin—and a small, featureless burner phone.

""You have 24 hours,"" he said, his voice leaving no room for argument. ""Use the time to rest, figure out your next move, and disappear. After that, you're on your own. I've done my part.""

He turned to leave the guest suite he'd put me in. The room was luxurious, with a bed that looked like a cloud and an en-suite bathroom bigger than my first apartment. Another part of the gilded cage.

""Why?"" The word escaped me before I could stop it. ""Why help me at all? You hate my husband. You should have been happy to leave me for dead.""

Julian paused at the door, his back still to me. The broad set of his shoulders was rigid. For a moment, I didn't think he would answer.

""Because five years ago, Mark Vance destroyed something I cared about,"" he said, his voice low and laced with a venom that chilled me to the bone. ""He cost me more than just money. And the enemy of my enemy... is a useful tool. For now.""

He closed the door with a soft, definitive click, leaving me alone in the silent, opulent room. I wasn't a person to him. I was a weapon to be aimed at Mark. I had traded one prison for another, one monster for a different kind. And the clock was ticking.


Chapter 3
I woke to the sound of an angry voice. It was morning, though the storm still raged outside, casting the penthouse in a perpetual twilight. The gray light filtered through the massive windows, painting stripes across the minimalist furniture. My body ached with a deep, throbbing pain, a constant reminder of my new reality.

The voice was Julian's, coming from the main living area. It was sharp, clipped, and furious. Curiosity, and a desperate need to understand my captor, pulled me from the bed. My leg, now encased in a lightweight cast, protested, but I gritted my teeth and limped silently toward the sound.

I peeked around the corner of the hallway. Julian was pacing in front of a giant wall-mounted screen, a video call in progress. He was dressed in a perfectly tailored dark suit, but his tie was loosened, and his hair was slightly disheveled, as if he'd been running his hands through it.

""Unacceptable!"" he snarled at the faces on the screen. ""They came out of nowhere with a counter-offer that anticipates our every move. How is this possible? It's like they're reading our playbook.""

A man on the screen, his face pale, stammered, ""Mr. Thorne, their strategy is... unconventional. It's aggressive, almost reckless, but it's boxing us in. We're about to lose the Sterling acquisition.""

My bl**d ran cold. I didn't need to hear any more. I recognized the strategy instantly. The high-risk gambles, the psychological warfare disguised as finance, the way it preyed on an opponent's ego and forced them into a corner. It was Mark's signature. He had bragged about it to me for years, calling it his ""art."" He was outmaneuvering Julian Thorne, and he was about to win.

A cold, hard knot of resolve formed in my stomach. Julian had given me 24 hours. He saw me as a ""tool."" But a tool was useless if it couldn't be wielded. I had to prove I was more than that. I had to prove I was indispensable.

While Julian was occupied with his failing acquisition, I limped back to the guest room. I pulled the small, carved wooden bird from the pocket of my ruined coat. In the clear morning light, I examined it more closely. It was a nightingale, its head cocked as if in mid-song. As I turned it over and over in my hands, my thumb brushed against a tiny, almost invisible seam on its base.

With a bit of pressure from my fingernail, the base popped open. It wasn't a secret compartment, not really. Instead, etched into the wood in minuscule script was a sequence of numbers and letters. It looked like a password, or maybe coordinates. A code. A secret that Mark had dropped, a secret that now belonged only to me. I snapped it shut, my heart pounding. This was leverage. This was my own.

Taking a deep breath, I walked out of the room and straight toward Julian's office, a glass-walled room that overlooked the stormy bay. He had just ended his call and was standing with his back to the door, staring out at the churning water. His posture radiated defeat and fury.

""Your opponent is baiting you,"" I said.

He spun around, his eyes flashing with surprise and then annoyance. ""I don't have time for games, Mrs. Vance. Your 24 hours are ticking away.""

""He's making you think he's after Sterling's tech patents,"" I continued, ignoring him and stepping further into the room. The scent of coffee and something clean, like ozone from the storm, filled the air. ""He's not. He's after their shipping network. He's letting you waste your capital trying to protect the wrong asset.""

""He's counting on your pride,"" I pressed on, leaning against the edge of his massive desk, my voice steady despite the tremor in my hands. ""He wants you to believe your company's tech is the only prize worth having. He'll let you win a bidding war for the patents, bankrupting your liquid assets in the process. Then, at the last minute, a shell corporation he controls will swoop in and buy up Sterling's debt, which includes control of the shipping lanes. He won't just win the acquisition; he'll cripple Thorne Industries in the process.""

Silence. Julian stared at me, his face a mask of stone. The only sound was the drumming of the rain against the glass. I saw a flicker of something in his eyes—not belief, not yet, but a crack in his certainty. He was a brilliant man, but Mark's specialty was exploiting the blind spots of brilliant men. And I knew every single one of Mark's di**y tricks. I had been his confidante, his sounding board, his silent partner for years.

""How could you possibly know that?"" he asked, his voice a low, dangerous growl.

""Because I know the man who designed the strategy,"" I said simply. ""I know how he thinks. I know he believes everyone has a weakness, and yours is pride.""

He was stunned. I could see it in the slight widening of his eyes, the way his jaw clenched. He was simultaneously impressed and deeply, profoundly suspicious. I had just laid bare the mind of his greatest enemy, proving I was more than just a victim. I was a strategist.

A war was raging behind his eyes. His desperation was fighting his distrust. Finally, desperation won.

""Fine,"" he bit out, moving to his computer. ""Let's say I believe you. To counter this, I'd need to pull our offer for the patents and redirect everything to the debt acquisition. But the board will never approve it without precedent. They'll think I'm insane.""

He began typing furiously. ""The only way is to invoke an emergency clause, which requires proof of a similar existential threat in the past. There was one... years ago. A corporate sabotage that nearly bankrupted my father. We never found out who was behind it.""

He squinted at the screen, his fingers flying across the keyboard. ""The only person who ever outplayed me,"" he said, his voice thick with a bitter, old anger. ""An anonymous rival my father codenamed 'Nightingale'.""

The name hit me like a physical blow. The air rushed from my lungs. My bl**d turned to ice water in my veins. *Nightingale.*

A memory, sharp and unwelcome, flashed in my mind. Years ago, when Mark and I were first married. He'd called it a ""harmless corporate game,"" a ""thought exercise."" He'd given me the data, the strategies, the backdoors. He'd flattered me, praised my intelligence, made me feel like a brilliant partner in his ascent. He'd gaslit me into believing it was all just a simulation. I was the one who had analyzed the weaknesses in Thorne Industries' old system. I was the one who had written the code. I was the one who had executed the plan.

Julian looked up from his screen, his eyes narrowing as he saw my stricken face. The color had drained from my cheeks. My hand was pressed against my mouth, and I was trembling.

""What is it?"" he demanded, his suspicion returning full force. ""You look like you've seen a ghost.""

I couldn't breathe. I couldn't think. The truth was a stone in my throat. My past and present were colliding in this sterile, glass-walled office, and I was about to be crushed between them.

I lowered my hand, my eyes locking with his. The wh**per that escaped my lips was the sound of my world shattering.

""The saboteur... the one you called Nightingale... It was me.""


Chapter 4
The silence that followed my confession was a living thing. It was heavy and suffocating, pressing in on me from all sides. The only sound was the relentless drumming of rain against the vast windows of the penthouse, a mournful percussion for the demolition of my last hope.

Julian Thorne’s face, which had been a mask of tense concentration, slowly transformed. The suspicion in his eyes hardened into something colder, sharper, and far more dangerous. It was a look of pure, undiluted fury. He didn't move, didn't speak. He just stared at me, and in his gaze, I saw the full weight of a years-old betrayal landing squarely on my shoulders.

""You,"" he finally said, the word a low, guttural sound, filled with a loathing that made my skin crawl. ""You were Nightingale?""

I could only nod, my throat too tight to form words. My entire body felt like it was made of glass, fragile and about to shatter. The strength I had summoned to confront him had evaporated, leaving me hollowed out and exposed.

He took a step toward me, his movements slow and deliberate, like a predator closing in. ""The attack that nearly destroyed my family's company. The one that put my father in an early grave from the stress. That was *you*?""

""I didn't know,"" I whispered, the words pathetic even to my own ears. ""Mark... he told me it was a game. A simulation. He said it was a test of my skills, that none of it was real. I was young, I was st**id, I... I loved him.""

The confession felt like poison on my tongue. Love. What a hollow, meaningless word for the web of lies Mark had spun around me.

Julian let out a short, sharp laugh, a sound utterly devoid of humor. ""A game? You cost us billions. You nearly cost us everything. And you thought it was a *game*?"" He stopped directly in front of me, forcing me to tilt my head back to meet his furious gaze. He was so close I could feel the heat radiating from his body, the sheer force of his anger a palpable wave.

""Get out,"" he said, his voice dropping to a deadly quiet.

Panic seized me. ""Julian, please. You have to listen to me. I can help you beat him. I know how he operates because he used me to do it!""

""I said, get out!"" he roared, his control finally snapping. He gestured wildly toward the door. ""Your 24 hours are up. Get out of my home. Get out of my city. I don't care where you go, but if I ever see you again, I will personally hand you over to Mark myself.""

Tears streamed down my face, hot and shameful. ""Where can I go? He's hunting me. He'll k**l me.""

""That sounds like a personal problem,"" he shot back, his words like daggers. ""You made your bed when you aligned yourself with that monster. Now you can lie in it.""

He turned his back on me, a clear dismissal. He was done. The enemy of his enemy was, it turned out, his original enemy. But I couldn't accept it. I had nowhere else to go. Desperation clawed at me, pushing me past fear, past shame.

""The wooden bird,"" I blurted out.

He didn't turn around. ""What?""

""At the cliff, where he left me. I found a small wooden bird. A nightingale. It has a code inscribed on the base.""

That made him pause. He slowly turned back to face me, his eyes narrowed to slits. ""A code to what?""

""I don't know. A bank account, a location, a k**l switch for his entire operation. It's the only thing I have that's mine. But I know it's important. He must have dropped it when he pushed me. It's leverage, Julian. Leverage against the man who ruined both of our lives.""

I saw the war in his eyes again. The fury was still there, a burning inferno. But now, it was competing with the cold, hard logic of a CEO. He hated me. But he hated Mark more. And I was holding a potential key to Mark's destruction.

He stood there for a long, agonizing minute, his jaw working. The tension in the room was so thick I could barely breathe. He was weighing his hatred for me against his desire for revenge.

""Give it to me,"" he finally said.

""No,"" I replied, my voice shaking but firm. ""It's mine. We use it together. You give me your protection, your resources. I give you my knowledge of Mark's playbook and whatever this code unlocks. We form an alliance. A real one. Not 'tool' and 'master.' Partners. Until he's finished.""

It was the boldest move of my life. I was negotiating with a man who wanted to throw me to the wolves, a man I had personally wronged in the most profound way.

He stared at me, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes. Was it grudging respect? Or was he simply calculating the new odds?

""Fine,"" he bit out, the word sounding like it was torn from him. ""You can stay. For now. You will help me win the Sterling acquisition. You will help me decipher that code. But make no mistake, Clara. We are not partners. We are not friends. This is a transaction. The moment you are no longer useful, you are gone. Do you understand?""

""I understand,"" I whispered, relief washing over me so intensely my knees felt weak.

He nodded curtly, already turning back to his computer. The truce, if it could be called that, was fragile and born of mutual hatred for another. ""Tell me everything you know about his strategy. Every detail. We have less than twelve hours to dismantle it.""

The rest of the day was a blur of frantic energy. We worked side-by-side in his office, the air thick with unspoken animosity. I laid out Mark's entire psychological profile, his ego, his tells, his preferred methods of attack. Julian, in turn, absorbed the information, his brilliant mind quickly formulating a counter-offensive that was as ruthless as it was elegant.

For hours, we were just two minds focused on a single goal. I forgot he was my captor. He seemed to forget I was the ghost of his past. There was only the problem, and the burning need to solve it.

Late that night, after we had sent the final, encrypted instructions that would hopefully turn the tables on Mark, exhaustion hit me like a physical weight. Julian was on the phone with his legal team, his voice once again the confident, commanding tone of a CEO.

I slipped away to my room and pulled out the burner phone he'd given me. My fingers trembled as I dialed the only number I knew by heart. It rang twice before she picked up.

""Hello?""

""Sophie,"" I breathed, my voice cracking with emotion.

""Clara? Oh my god, Clara! Where are you? Mark told everyone you had a breakdown, that you ran away. I've been so worried!"" Sophie's voice, warm and familiar and full of genuine concern, was the first kind thing I had heard in days.

""I can't talk for long,"" I whispered, tears welling in my eyes. ""Sophie, listen to me. None of it is true. Mark... he tried to k**l me.""

The silence on the other end of the line was absolute. Then, ""What? Clara, that's... that's insane.""

""It's the truth. I can't explain everything now. I'm safe, for the moment. But I need your help. I need you to be my eyes and ears. I need you to trust me, even if what I ask sounds crazy.""

Sophie was my rock, my best friend since college. She was a brilliant data analyst, smarter than anyone I knew. If anyone could help me, it was her.

""Of course,"" she said, her voice shaking but resolute. ""Anything. What do you need?""

Then the door opened, and this person walked in, shaking the rain off their jacket like they’d just stepped out of a movie scene.

They ordered, looked around, and for some reason chose the empty seat across from me. We ended up talking at first about how miserable the weather was, then about books, travel, and somehow life in general.

Here’s the crazy part: the barista messed up their order, gave them the wrong drink, and without thinking they just slid it over to me and said, *“Here, this one suits you better anyway.”* It sounds silly, but it felt like the most natural thing in the world.

We sat there for almost three hours, completely forgetting about the rain outside. By the time we left, the storm had cleared, and it felt like the universe had timed it just for us.

1ncgc7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Lucyella119/comments/1ncgc7e/what_are_the_financial_documents_of_a_small/,What Are the Financial Documents of a Small Business?,"Financial documents are essential records that small businesses maintain to track their financial performance, ensure compliance, and support decision-making. These documents, generated through bookkeeping and accounting processes, provide insights into a business’s financial health and are critical for stakeholders like owners, investors, lenders, and tax authorities. For small businesses, which often operate with limited resources, maintaining accurate and organized financial documents is vital for success. Below is an overview of the key financial documents commonly used by small businesses.

**1. Balance Sheet**

The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a small business’s financial position at a specific point in time, detailing its assets, liabilities, and equity.

**Purpose:** Shows what the business owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and the owner’s stake (equity), based on the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity.

**Components:**

**Assets:** Cash, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, etc.

**Liabilities:** Accounts payable, loans, accrued expenses, etc.

**Equity:** Owner’s capital, retained earnings, etc.

**Example:** A small retail store’s balance sheet might show $10,000 in cash, $5,000 in inventory (assets), $3,000 in accounts payable (liabilities), and $12,000 in owner’s equity.

**Use:** Used by owners to assess financial stability, by lenders to evaluate loan eligibility, and by investors to gauge business value.

**Frequency:** Typically prepared monthly, quarterly, or annually.

**2. Income Statement (Profit and Loss Statement)**

The income statement summarizes a small business’s revenues, expenses, and net income or loss over a specific period, showing profitability.

**Purpose:** Measures financial performance by comparing income to expenses, indicating whether the business is profitable.

**Components:**

**Revenue:** Income from sales, services, or other sources (e.g., $20,000 in sales).

**Expenses:** Costs like rent, utilities, payroll, or supplies (e.g., $15,000 in total expenses).

**Net Income:** Revenue minus expenses (e.g., $5,000 profit).

**Example:** A freelance consultant’s income statement might show $8,000 in client fees (revenue), $2,000 in software and travel costs (expenses), resulting in $6,000 net income.

**Use:** Helps owners track profitability, adjust pricing or costs, and report income for tax purposes.

**Frequency:** Prepared monthly, quarterly, or annually.

**3. Cash Flow Statement**

The cash flow statement tracks the flow of cash into and out of a small business over a period, highlighting how cash is generated and spent.

**Purpose:** Monitors liquidity, showing whether the business has enough cash to cover operational needs like payroll or supplier payments.

**Components:**

**Operating Activities:** Cash from core operations, like customer payments or expense payments.

**Investing Activities:** Cash used for or generated from asset purchases/sales, like buying equipment.

**Financing Activities:** Cash from loans, repayments, or owner investments.

**Example:** A café’s cash flow statement might show $10,000 from sales (operating), -$3,000 for a new coffee machine (investing), and $5,000 from a loan (financing).

**Use:** Helps owners manage cash shortages, plan for major expenses, and ensure solvency.

**Frequency:** Prepared monthly or quarterly.

**4. General Ledger**

The general ledger is the central record of all financial transactions, organized by accounts (e.g., cash, revenue, expenses), and serves as the foundation for other financial documents.

**Purpose:** Tracks every transaction in the double-entry system, ensuring accuracy and providing raw data for financial statements.

**Components:** Includes accounts like cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, revenue, and expenses, with debit and credit entries.

**Example:** A bakery’s general ledger might record a $500 sale (debit cash, credit revenue) and a $200 supplier payment (debit accounts payable, credit cash).

**Use:** Used by [Bookkeeping and Accounting Services Austin](https://www.aenten.com/us/locations/austin/) to maintain accurate records and by accountants to prepare financial statements or audits.

**Frequency:** Updated daily or as transactions occur.

**5. Accounts Receivable and Payable Ledgers**

These ledgers track money owed to and by the business, focusing on credit transactions with customers and suppliers.

**Accounts Receivable Ledger:**

**Purpose:** Lists amounts owed by customers for goods or services sold on credit.

**Example:** A small marketing agency’s receivable ledger might show $2,000 owed by a client for a campaign, due in 30 days.

**Use:** Helps track unpaid invoices and manage collections.

**Accounts Payable Ledger:**

**Purpose:** Lists amounts the business owes to suppliers or creditors.

**Example:** A contractor’s payable ledger might show $1,500 owed to a supplier for materials, due next month.

**Use:** Ensures timely payments to avoid penalties and maintain supplier relationships.

**Frequency:** Updated as credit transactions occur, reviewed weekly or monthly.

**6. Bank Statements and Reconciliation Reports**

Bank statements, paired with reconciliation reports, verify that a business’s cash records align with its bank account.

**Purpose:** Ensures the accuracy of cash balances by comparing the business’s cash account in the general ledger with bank records.

**Components:** Lists deposits, withdrawals, fees, and interest, with reconciliation reports resolving discrepancies like unrecorded transactions.

**Example:** A small business’s reconciliation report might identify a $50 bank fee not recorded in the ledger, prompting an adjustment.

**Use:** Detects errors, fraud, or unrecorded transactions, ensuring cash accuracy.

**Frequency:** Reconciled monthly, based on bank statement cycles.

**7. Tax Documents**

Tax documents include records and reports prepared for tax compliance, such as income tax returns, sales tax reports, and payroll tax filings.

**Purpose:** Ensures compliance with tax regulations and provides documentation for deductions and filings.

**Components:**

**Income Tax Returns:** Summarize annual income and expenses for tax authorities.

**Sales Tax Reports:** Track taxable sales and remittances, common for retail businesses.

**Payroll Tax Records:** Document employee taxes withheld and paid, if applicable.

**Example:** A small boutique files a sales tax report showing $3,000 in taxable sales, remitting the appropriate tax to the government.

**Use:** Supports accurate tax filings, maximizes deductions, and prepares for audits.

**Frequency:** Prepared quarterly or annually, based on tax requirements.

**Why These Documents Matter**

**These financial documents are critical for small businesses because they:**

**Ensure Compliance:** Provide records for tax filings, audits, and regulatory requirements.

**Support Decision-Making:** Offer insights into profitability, cash flow, and financial health, guiding budgeting or expansion plans.

**Build Credibility:** Organized records impress lenders, investors, or partners, improving access to funding or partnerships.

**Prevent Errors:** Regular tracking and reconciliation catch discrepancies early, avoiding costly mistakes.

**How Small Businesses Manage These Documents**

**Bookkeeping Software:** Tools like QuickBooks, Xero, or Wave automate the creation of ledgers, financial statements, and tax reports, saving time and reducing errors.

**Manual Systems:** Some micro-businesses use spreadsheets or paper ledgers, though this is less efficient and error-prone.

**Outsourcing:** Many small businesses hire bookkeepers or accounting firms to maintain and prepare these documents, especially for tax compliance or complex reporting.



**Conclusion**

The key financial documents for a small business include the balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, general ledger, accounts receivable and payable ledgers, bank statements with reconciliation reports, and tax documents. These records ensure financial accuracy, support compliance, and provide insights for decision-making. By maintaining these documents, whether through software or professional help, small businesses can manage their finances effectively, avoid penalties, and position themselves for growth.

1ncgc2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1ncgc2a/hello_new_to_the_world_of_moka_pots_and_really/,Hello! New to the world of moka pots and really coffee in general. And I've been having some trouble with knowing where to solve my problems since there's so many variables. Any help from the moka enthusiasts would be very appreciated.,"This is going to be sort of a dump of information from my past couple weeks of using the moka pot. So sorry in advance, I just want to get all the relevant info out that I need to for someone to make an accurate assessment.

So to start off, the specific moka pot I have seems to be an enigma. I can't seem to find it online. The only name it has on it is ""Urban Elements"". I was gifted it by my dad who got it a while ago and never used it. There is no indication of its size, but it seems to be about the same as a 6-cup bialetti moka pot. Filling the water to just under the pressure release valve is close to 375ml+ of water. (I know it's quite a bit). I heard about the rule with moka pots to fill up the basket all the way with un-tamped grounds. However, that ended up needing about 30g+ of coffee which seemed like a lot. I ended up going with about 22-23g instead and it seemed to make fairly good coffee, albeit a bit strong. I also tried using less water, 300ml instead. That coffee seemed a bit more bitter. So I've been sticking to about 350ml of water, which ends up being about a centimeter below the pressure release valve. After brewing the coffee, I get out about 175ml of coffee. The first few times I used the moka pot, when I was still experimenting with weights and amounts, I merely rinsed out the components and wiped them with a paper towel. But then read that oils can adhere to the moka pot and make the brew taste bad. So just before this most recent brew I washed the moka pot with warm water and dish soap. The coffee bean I've been using is a medium roast espresso blend called Leftist Espresso. And the grinder I have is the Opus conical burr grinder from Fellow (also a gift, it was not my choice but seems to work fairly well. Though again, I am far from an expert). The grind setting, I've been adjusting. At first I went with a lower setting that was just above espresso level according to the manufacturer. However the water with that first brew sputtered out. So the next time I tried a tad coarser of a grind and it seemed to work well. The level is the lowest aeropress setting according to the manufacturer. It feels a little like whole wheat flour. I tried a little coarser and also a little finer, I couldn't *really* notice a difference with taste between the two to be honest. So I just stuck with about somewhere in the middle between too fine that it sputters and too coarse that it starts getting into pour-over tier. Also with the brew, I've tried a slower brew time. But then heard that too long of a brew can heat up the coffee and make it taste bad. So I've been going with a faster brew time. Not enough to make the coffee sputter out. And then right when the coffee flow speeds up I put the pot under cold water to stop it and pour the coffee immediately. And finally, I have started using an aeropress filter to limit the amount of grounds that make their way into the coffee.

So my issue is, that this most recent brew had a bit of a sour aftertaste. And generally there's been a trend of the coffee tasting perhaps almost burnt? Not that it tastes burnt. But like there's a hint of that sort of flavor maybe. And I don't really know what to change with my setup since there's so many things I COULD change. Firstly, I do want a smaller moka pot. 175ml of strong coffee seems a bit much. I don't need that much kick to start my day. I don't really need any kick to start my day, I've been going without coffee for my entire life. I just like the taste of coffee and especially milk drinks and so like to have a cup every now and then. I don't know if an off-brand moka pot will make worse coffee than a bialetti or similar one. If that is a factor please let me know. I've had a smaller brewer in mind anyways. Perhaps it's the type of coffee, I have only tried the one bean so far, I haven't tried lighter or darker roasts yet. From what I understand, a lighter roast is more acidic but less bitter and needs a finer grind size. Whereas a darker roast is more bitter, less acidic, and needs a coarser grind size. Perhaps I should try a darker roast? Also from previous research, I've heard a coarser grind can make the coffee more acidic tasting? So should I perhaps try a finer grind setting? Does a faster brew time make the coffee more acidic? Should I slow that down more? Should I try less water? More water? Less coffee? More coffee? Should I tamp the coffee down a bit?

Apologies for the long post. There's just so many things to consider I don't really know where to start with adjustments. Any help would be much appreciated. If possible, I'd like to avoid large purchases. So I will be sticking with my current grinder. Hopefully that's not the issue 🙏.

TL;DR: Coffee has slightly sour aftertaste, and I don't know anything about coffee ;-;",0,1757417411.0,mokapot,3,0.5,False
1ncgbo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane/comments/1ncgbo6/scenes_from_the_canadian_healthcare_system/,Scenes from the Canadian Healthcare System,"Bricks crumbled from the hospital's once moderately attractive facade. One had already claimed a victim, who was lying unconscious before the front doors. Thankfully, he was already at the hospital. The automatic doors themselves were out of service, so a handwritten note said:

*Admission by crowbar only.*

(*Crowbar not provided.*)

Wilson had thoughtfully brought his own, wedged it into the space between the doors, pried them apart and slid inside before they closed on him.

“There's a man by the entrance, looks like he needs medical attention,” he told the receptionist.

“Been there since July,” she said. “If he needed help, he'd have come in by now. He's probably waiting for someone.”

“What if he's dead?” Wilson asked.

“Then he doesn't need medical attention—now does he?”

Wilson filled out the forms the receptionist pushed at him. When he was done, “Go have a seat in the Waiting Rooms. Section EE,” she told him.

He traversed the Waiting Rooms until finding his section. It was filled with cobwebs. In a corner, a child caught in one had been half eaten by what Wilson presumed had been a spider but could have very well been another patient.

The seats themselves were not seats but cheap, Chinese-made wood coffins. He found an empty one and climbed inside.

Time passed.

After a while, Wilson grew impatient and decided to go back to the receptionist and ask how long he should expect to wait, but the Waiting Rooms are an intricate, endlesslessly rearranging labyrinth. Many who go in, never come out.

# **SCENES FROM THE CANADIAN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM**

—dedicated to Tommy Douglas

The patient lies anaesthesized and cut open on the operating room table *when the lights flicker—then go out completely.*

SURGEON: Nurse, flashlight.

NURSE: I'm afraid we ran out of batteries.

SURGEON: Well, does anybody in the room have a cell phone?

MAN: I do.

SURGEON: Shine it on the wound so I can see what I'm doing.

The man holds the cell phone over the patient, illuminating his bloody incision.

The surgeon works.

SURGEON: Also, who are you?

MAN: My name's Asquith. I live here.

[Asquith relays his life story and how he came to be homeless. As he nears the end of his tale, his breath turns to steam.]

NURSE: Must be a total outage.

SURGEON: I can't work like this. I can barely feel my fingers.

ASQUITH: Allow me to share a tip, sir?

SURGEON: Please.

Asquith shoves both hands into the patient's wound, still holding the cell phone.

The surgeon, shrugging, follows suit.

SURGEON: That really is comfortable. Everyone, gather round and warm yourselves.

The entire surgical team crowds the operating table, pushing their hands sloppily into the patient's wound. *Just then the patient wakes up.*

PATIENT: Oh my God! What's going on? …and why is it so cold in here?

NURSE (to doctor): Looks like the anesthetic wore off.

DOCTOR (to patient): Remain calm. There's been a slight disturbance to the power supply, so we're warming ourselves on your insides. But we have a cell phone, and once the feeling returns to my hands I'll complete the operation.

The patient moans.

ASQUITH (to surgeon): Sir?

SURGEON (to Asquith): Yes, what is it?

ASQUITH (to surgeon): It's terribly slippery in here and I've unfortunately lost hold of the cell phone. Maybe if I just—

“No, you don't need treatment,” the official repeats for the third time.

“But my arm, it's fallen off,” the woman in the wheelchair says, placing the severed limb on the desk between them. Both her legs are wrapped in old, saturated bandages. Flies buzz.

“That sort of ‘falling off’ is to be expected given your age,” says the official.

“I'm twenty-seven!” the woman yells.

“Almost twenty-eight, and please don't raise your voice,” the official says, pointing to a sign which states: *Please Treat Hospital Staff With Respect*. Above it, another sign, hanging by dental floss from the brown, water-stained ceiling announces this as the **Department of You're Fine.**

The elevator doors open. Three people walk in. The person nearest the control panel asks, “What floor for you folks?”

“Second, thanks.”

“None for me, thank you. I'm to wait here for my hysterectomy.”

As the elevator doors close, a stretcher races past. Two paramedics are pushing a wounded police officer down the hall in a shopping cart, dodging patients, imitating the sounds of a siren.

A doctor joins. 

DOCTOR: Brief me.

PARAMEDIC #1: Male, thirty-four, two gunshot wounds, one to the stomach, the other to the head. Heart failing. Losing a lot of blood.

PARAMEDIC #2: If he's going to live, he needs attention now!

Blood spurts out of the police officer's body, which  a visitor catches in a Tim Horton's coffee cup, before running off, yelling, “I've got it! I've got it! Now give my daughter her transfusion!”

The paramedics and doctor wheel the police officer into a closet.

PARAMEDIC #1: He's only got a few minutes.

They hook him up to a heart monitor, fish latex gloves out of the garbage and pull them on.

The doctor clears her throat.

The two paramedics bow their heads.

DOCTOR: Before we begin, we acknowledge that this operation takes place on the traditional, unceded—

The police officer spasms, vomiting blood all over the doctor.

DOCTOR (wiping her face): Ugh! Please respect the land acknowledgement.

POLICE OFFICER (gargling): Help… me…

DOCTOR (louder): —territory of the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishinaabeg, the Chippewa—

The police officer grabs the doctor's hand *and squeezes.*

The heart monitor flatlines…

DOCTOR: God damn it! We didn't finish the acknowledgement.

P.A. SYSTEM (V.O.): Now serving number fourteen thousand one hundred sixty six. Now serving number fourteen thousand one hundred sixty six. Now serving number…

Wilson, hunchbacked, pale and propping himself up with a cane upcycled from a human spine, said hoarsely, “That's me.” 

“The doctor will see you now. Wing 12C, room 3.” The receptionist pointed down a long, straight, vertiginous hallway.

Wilson shaved in a bathroom and set off.

Initially he was impressed.

Wing 21C was pristine, made up of rooms filled with sparkling new machines that a few lucky patients were using to get diagnosed with all the latest, most popular medical conditions.

20C was only a little worse, a little older. The machines whirred a little more loudly. “Never mind your ‘physical symptoms,’” a doctor was saying. “Tell me more about your dreams. What was your mother like? Do you ever get aroused by—”

In 19C the screaming began, as doctors administered electroshocks to a pair of gagged women tied to their beds with leather straps. Another doctor prescribed opium. “Trepanation?” said a third. “Just a small hole in the skull to relieve some pressure.”

In 18C, an unconscious man was having tobacco smoke blown up his anus. A doctor in 17C tapped a glass bottle full of green liquid and explained the many health benefits of his homemade elixir. And so on, down the hall, backwards in time, and Wilson walked, and his whiskers grew until, when finally he reached 12C, his beard was nearly dragging behind him on the packed dirt floor.

He found the third room, entered.

After several hours a doctor came in and asked Wilson what ailed him. Wilson explained he had been diagnosed with cancer.

“We'll do the blood first,” said the doctor.

“Oh, no. I've already had bloodwork done and have my results right here,"" said Wilson, holding out a packet of printouts.

The doctor stared.

“They should also be available on your system,” added Wilson.

“System?”

“Yes—”

“Silence!” the doctor commanded, muttered something about demons under his breath, closed the door, then took out a fleam, several bowls and a clay vessel of black leeches.

“I think there's been a terrible mistake,” said Wilson, backing up…

Presently and outside, another falling brick—**bonk!**—claims another victim, and now there are two unconscious bodies at the hospital entrance.

*“Which doctor?” the patient asks.*

*“Yes.”*

*“Doctor… Yes?”*

*“Yes, witch doctor,” says the increasingly frustrated nurse* (“That's what I want to know!”) as a shaman steps into the room wearing a necklace of human teeth and banging a small drum that may or may not be made from human skin. “Recently licensed.”

The shaman smiles.

So does the Hospital Director as the photo's taken: he, beaming, beside a bald girl in a hospital bed, who keeps trying to tell him something but is constantly interrupted, as the Director goes on and on about the wonders of the Canadian healthcare system: “And that's why we're lucky, Virginia, to live in a country as great as this one, where everyone, no matter their creed or class, receives the same level of treatment. You and I, we're both staring down Death, both fighting that modern monster called cancer, but, Virginia, the system—*our* system—is what gives us a chance.”

He shakes her hand, poses for another photo, then he's out the door before hearing the girl say, “But I don't have cancer. I have alopecia.”

Then it's up the elevator to the hospital roof for the Hospital Director, where a helicopter is waiting.

He gets in.

“Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,” he tells the pilot.

Three hours later, New York City comes into view in all its rise and sprawl and splendour, and as he does every time he crosses the border for treatment, the Hospital Director feels a sense of relief, thinking, *Yes, it'll all be fine. I'm going to live for a long time yet.*",2,1757417379.0,normancrane,0,1.0,False

1ncg9w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1ncg9w9/when_my_husband_told_me_he_was_in_love_novel_from/,"When my husband told me he was in love Novel: From the first page to the last jaw-dropping chapter, I have it all — if you’re curious enough, comment now and I’ll reveal it.","Baby... I know. I miss you too."" I heard my husband talking to another woman on the phone. ""It's just a month. That's all. After that, we'll make everything official. No more hiding, no more guilt.""

My breath caught.

""Who is she?"" I choked.

""Look, Violet. I've met someone,"" he said, as if he were discussing the weather. ""And I want to be with her. Her name is Alice. You've met her once or twice and she used to be in my architecture program.""

""Is it that Alice? Your first love?"" I whispered.

He hesitated a bit too long.

That was enough.

""I didn't mean for it to happen like this.""

""You didn't mean to cheat on your wife?"" I snapped, the crack finally splitting through my voice.

""Do you still love me?"" I asked, so quietly it was almost a prayer.

""I... care about you. You've always been good to me.""

My throat tightened. That wasn't the answer. It wasn't even close.

""But I'm in love with Alice,"" he finished.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If someone had told me that love could survive betrayal, I would have laughed in their face. The night I signed my divorce papers, I told myself it was the end of my marriage, of the man I once loved, and of the life I thought we'd have together. James had been my everything until I learned he wasn't mine at all, not in the way a husband should be.

I packed away the memories like fragile glass, determined never to touch them again. He moved on, or so I believed, and I built a new life without him.

But the thing about endings is that they don't always stay that way. Sometimes, life circles back, pushing you face-to-face with the one person you swore you'd never forgive. Sometimes the love you thought was shattered still has pieces sharp enough to cut and strong enough to hold you together if you're brave enough to try.

I didn't know it then, but our story wasn't over. It was only waiting for the right time to begin again.

The road to the house hadn't changed much. The same crooked wooden sign still marked the turnoff like a secret only they knew. The trees on either side leaned in slightly, branches brushing against each other overhead, forming that gentle tunnel of green that Violet used to love in the spring. The silence between them in the car stretched longer than the road itself. Only the soft hum of tires against pavement and the occasional shuffle of her husband's hand on the steering wheel filled the void.

James hadn't said much since they left the city. She hadn't expected him to. She sat with her hands folded in her lap, the leather of the seat cool against her palms. Outside, the town she once called home blurred past with coffee shops, old gas stations, the faded yellow school building that used to fill her days with routine and meaning. It had been five years since she walked out of that classroom for the last time. Three since she stopped calling anywhere home.

But her mind wasn't here.

It was still there, a month and a half ago, standing barefoot in their kitchen, clutching a chipped mug of cold tea while her husband, the man she had loved for eleven years, calmly, clinically, ended their marriage.

""I've met someone,"" he said, as if he were discussing the weather. ""And I want to be with her.""

He hadn't even looked at her when he said it. He'd been standing by the sink, sleeves rolled to the elbow, the buttons of his white shirt misaligned by one. The left cuff was still damp from washing his hands.

""Her name is Alice. You've met her once or twice and she used to be in my architecture program. We've reconnected recently, and... I realized I feel something real with her. Something I haven't felt in a long time.""

She remembered the way her stomach dropped. Not sharply, not all at once. It was slow and heavy like something precious sliding off a table, falling in stages before it hit the ground.

""You feel something real with her,"" she echoed, more to herself than to him.

He nodded. Like a man who had already made his peace.

""I'm not happy anymore,"" he added. ""Neither of us are, if we're being honest. This isn't working, and I don't think it has been for a long time. I don't want to keep pretending.""

Pretending.

She wanted to scream then. Wanted to shatter the mug in her hand, throw it across the room and demand to know when he had decided she wasn't enough but her body betrayed her. She just stood there, still as stone, trying to hold in every crack.

""I don't want to hurt you,"" he said.

As if he hadn't already carved her in half with every word. She blinked at him, once. Then again. The words tasted like ash before they even left her mouth.

""Is it that Alice? Your first love?"" she asked, her voice a brittle whisper.

He hesitated a bit too long.",2,1757417225.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

These sliders are an ideal choice for those looking to enhance the mobility of heavy kitchen appliances on their countertops. Let’s dive into the key aspects of these self-adhesive items.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Crafted with a simple yet functional design, these appliance sliders are truly a game changer. Each slider is blue and round with a modest size of 3/4 inch in diameter, making them unobtrusive under most appliances. The material, a mix of Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and rubber, feels durable and robust. After attaching these sliders underneath my stand mixer and coffee maker, I immediately noticed how smooth and effortless movement became. With a thickness of just 0.75 inches, they also preserve the sleek appearance of your kitchen setup without being overly bulky or noticeable.

**Performance and Efficiency**  
Performing daily kitchen cleaning used to feel like a chore, especially when it involved appliances that stubbornly clung to the countertop. However, with these appliance sliders in place, operating and repositioning heavy items like my pressure cooker became an absolute breeze. Sliding across my hardwood and marble countertops felt smooth and frictionless. The PTFE material ensures wear resistance, and the robust rubber pads provide ample support, even for heavier gadgets like my air fryer. Interestingly, the sliders didn’t leave behind any annoying residue or scratches, which speaks volumes about their surface safety.

[Check Vasterqua B0CLY2X6CH price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0cly2x6ch/)

**Ease of Installation**  
Getting these sliders ready took minimal effort. After cleaning the bottom of my appliances, I peeled off the adhesive backing, stuck the sliders onto the base, and let them sit for 12 hours as per the instructions. Trust me, the adhesive is no joke. Everything felt firmly in place, and even rigorous use didn’t knock them loose. The whole process reminded me of putting stickers on as a kid – oddly satisfying and equally effective.

**Strengths**  
- The sliders work perfectly on a range of surfaces like marble, wood, and stainless steel.  
- Their low profile and small size keep them discreetly tucked away.  
- Installation was straightforward and didn’t require any additional tools.  
- The tough PTFE material and durable adhesive ensure longevity.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The adhesive needs a solid 12 hours to fully set, which might be inconvenient for those in a rush.  
- While the sliders glide effortlessly, larger appliances might require more of them for even weight distribution.  
- The sliders come in blue only, which may not appeal to everyone’s taste.  

**Target Audience**  
If you struggle with heavy appliances that are tough to move and clean around, these sliders could seriously upgrade your kitchen experience. They’re especially helpful for busy home cooks who constantly reposition their tools, as well as for anyone with limited strength or mobility who could use an extra hand (or slider).

**Market Rivals**  
Other contenders in this category, such as felt pads and silicone sliders, are popular alternatives. While felt pads also minimize friction, they tend to wear out faster compared to these heavy-duty sliders. Silicone counterparts can provide adequate grip but often lack the smooth glide offered by the PTFE surface here. When comparing them side by side, these sliders strike the perfect balance between durability, functionality, and ease of movement, outperforming similar products on many fronts.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Considering the durability of the material, ease of installation, and seamless performance, this product shines in terms of cost-effectiveness. While appliances can often be complemented by cheaper accessories, these sliders deliver significant value for their price. A feature-rich yet accessible addition like this is genuinely worth the investment.

I was just watching LF and she was making coffee/tea for Zeeshan, and when Kunica asked why he couldn’t make it himself, she replied that he was dyeing his hair. Like bro, it takes 10–15 minutes before you even wash your hair after applying color, couldn’t he have just made it himself in that time??? But nah, why would he—he’s too busy with his friends. Then even Kunica asked her to throw some kachra into the dustbin for her, like bro do it yourself na???   
And the worst part is, none of these people will prioritize her when she’s in need 🤦🏽‍♀️ But she’s just too sweet to say NO to people on their face, and man, I can’t see her like this.

**Memory transcription subject: Brkar, ???**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: April 18th, 2123.*

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

“Master Brkar, could you please relax now?”

I heard the A.I., but I wasn’t really listening.  How did The Shepherd do that?  Skilled or not, he was just a normie.  The Arxur captain was no pushover either.  Was he just that strong, or was I just that weak?

“Please relax, Master Brkar.”

Yes.  That was the only logical conclusion.  I was already bigger and stronger than most Venlil.  The problem wasn’t my body.  It had to be *me.*  I’d struggled against an Arxur runt.  Sure, I’d played with him a bit, but could I take on the Arxur captain like that if I’d been serious?

…

No.  The answer was obvious.  I didn’t know that spear-paw technique.  I didn’t have the coordination to move like The Shepherd, or the bladed focus to react the way he did.  Even if I didn’t toy with her, she probably would have nailed me with that first trick hit.  It took Strength to control a battle right from the get-go, and I didn’t … I didn’t have that kind of Strength …

If The Shepherd was to be believed, people died while trying to make me.  Good people.  Apparently, I was expensive too.  They did it.  I was here.  I was alive.  My body met all physical expectations, but what was the point of a body worth a billion credits soaked in blood?  I wasn’t Strong.  The Shepherd was right.  I wasn’t Strong.

“Master Brkar, I sense that you’re distressed.  Please, rest.  It’ll be better when you wake up.”

The A.I.’s bleats finally registered.  I stared at the undulating display that rippled when it spoke.  It felt like it was staring back.

…

Finally, I flicked an ear and closed my eyes.  Let the sedatives do their job.  It was the first time I’d surrendered in my life.

It was the closest I’d come to crying.

…

**--------------**

***Temporal Transposition:*** *Date \[standardized human time\]: April 20th, 2123.*

**--------------**

…

*Mmm …*

*Hrmmmph …?*

How long had I been out?  My body was soaked in a nutrient bath.  I was *not* looking forward to the extra wool growth that it would cause.  My wool was a nightmare to shear.

It felt like I’d been sleeping for eons.  This sucked.  Why did I listen to that stable A.I.?  Hm.  I guess there wasn’t much else to do than sleep and …

…

Oh.

I wasn’t alone?  The lights were out, but I could see the glow of a holo screen flickering above The Field in front of me.  Wait … two holograms, I think?  It was all kinda fuzzy.

I blinked the blear from my eyes and my vision began to clear.  Part of the problem was the saliva The Shepherd left on the stable glass, *the jerk.*  I could see well enough, though.

Rebra was here.  A holo projector cast its content into the air on either side of her.  Recordings of dancing Humans in fast forward … heh, no.  Silly me.  I should have known a martial art when I saw it.  I think I was looking at … Capoeira?  Intermingled with other fighting styles?  It was hard to know for sure.  The holo recordings must have been accelerated at least 5x.  I couldn’t really keep up.  Was she even following this stuff?  Well, it *was* Rebra.  I don’t think she’d waste her time on something she couldn’t follow.

Her pupils were big, dilated.  It almost looked like some kind of trance.

The way she sat reminded me of a bunny rabbit.  She looked comfortable enough, though.  Was this her default sitting position?  Why was she panting?

“Pause,” she commanded.

[Those holograms stopped.](https://youtu.be/ozVVoOzRbik?si=Bmv2CaxM-46JoxGZ&t=135)

She broke into motion: rolling, whirling, bending, kicking.  All fours, three paws, two paws, forepaw.  Bipedalism didn’t seem to matter to her.  It looked like some kind of interpretive dance, but I knew better.  Capoeira.  It had to be.  At least, that was my initial thought, but as her movements progressed, I realized how wrong I was.  There was definitely *some* capoeira in there, but it was more than that.  Her tail was important.  It changed the game.  She’d corkscrew through their air, spooling off her tail.  She’d leap high, plant her tail to stop her fall, and unleash kick combinations into the air.  Then she’d roll through the air with a little tail hop, winding the appendage around her before lashing it back to ground, propping herself up again as her kick spiraled into the air.  Roll, hop, prop, kick.  Roll, hop, prop, kick.  Faster, faster.  Every hop repositioned her, making for a hard target, but the kicks spiraled on, building momentum, slicing harder.  This fighting style was part capoeira, part kantu, part kangaroo rat, part yoyo, part Tigger. 

Had she created this style?  … Yes.  Most likely.  Her body structure was somewhat like a Yotul, but no Yotul could pull this off.  No Human.  No normal Venlil.  Unless there were more Clevers out there, it had to be her.  Just her.

She collapsed, rolling across the ground, panting, coughing.  Instinct took over.  I felt myself try to move forward and check on her, but the restraints held me in place.

*\~Her stamina could use some work,\~* I thought.

“Resume,” she instructed between breaths.

The accelerated holograms continued.  She studied them as she caught her breath, sinking back into that bunny-like crouch as her eyes dilated again.  Another trance.

I watched her for a while.

*\~Rebra’s obviously not used to this,\~* I concluded.  \~*She’s pushing herself, but why?  How can she watch both screens at the same time?\~*

“I’ve got two eyes, don’t I?” Rebra asked.

*… What?*

Her big, round pupil shrank back to a horizontal oval as it slid back to focus on me.  I knew I was in range of her peripheral vision, but I didn’t know she’d noticed me.

The holograms vanished when Rebra scooped up the projector with her tail.  She rose to her hindlegs and approached me, wagging her tail, perhaps a bit too hard.  The sheer size of it made her wiggle off-balance with the action.  Catching herself before she toppled over, she slowed her wag to a sweeping, measured motion.  Based of the size on her tail, I guess she couldn’t wag too hard without losing balance.

“Feeling better?” she chirped.

To be honest, I wasn’t in a talking mood after The Shepherd incident.  I wasn’t in an anything mood, really.  It was rude.  I knew that, but I didn’t care enough to answer her at the time.

She gave an ear-flick.  “Yeah, I get it.  Take your time.”

Did she just assume she knew what I was thinking?  That was a tad annoying, even if her guess didn’t sound too far off.

Rebra’s tail dropped.  “Sorry …”

…

Okay.  That wasn’t a coincidence.  She was reading me, somehow, which led me back to the nagging question.

What exactly *was* Rebra?

What was *I,* for that matter?

The Shepherd said they’d Frankensteined me and my Clever back to life.  The latter had to be her, but that meant we were alive before.  *When* were we alive before?  I thought I was something new: a super Venlil, designed to take The Federation by the horns.  Obviously there was more to it than that.

Rebra tilted her head.  It didn’t feel like she knew what I was thinking this time, but those guesses couldn’t be coincidences.

Her pupils dilated just a bit.  She was studying me.

Fine.  I’d play her game.  If she wanted to study me, I’d study her back.

My specialty was combat, but I thought I was pretty intelligent.  Let’s see what I could deduce about her.

Hmm …

Her tail was strong, and prehensile.  Her tail didn’t end in the puff typical for a Venlil.  I mean, the puff was there, but it was lower.  The tip tapered to a point that curled around the holo projector.  Very dexterous.  I wished I could get a better look, but it was mostly behind her.

She moved her tail to the side and raised it, giving me a better look.

*Ahhh* … she must have been tracing my gaze.  It shouldn’t have been that obvious where I was looking, which meant she could track my eyes with high precision.  If she was that perceptive, reading my body language must have been easy for her.

Rebra slid the holo projector down her tail, catching it in the wool puff.  With the tip free, she wormed it around a bit, showing her full range of motion.  She tilted the holo projector.  It should have fallen from her tail, but it didn’t.  I looked closer.  The wool puff was hugging it somehow.  All Venlil could lift or lower their wool a bit.  Usually, it was subconscious.  An emotional response, but she’d clenched her wool around the projector like an oven mitt, or a baseball glove.  *Whoa …* I’d never imagined a Venlil could hold stuff with their wool.  Could she do that with all her wool, or just her tail?  Maybe just her tail.

Having given her a hug, I knew first-hand how soft the rest of her wool was, which meant the stuff on her tail had to be firmer.  This girl was practically a plushie.  No, that wasn’t quite right.  Plushies could only wish they were that cute.  Shameful.  I wanted to scoop her up and tuck her in my mane where nothing could hurt her.  Protective instincts, I guess.  It was almost the same as looking at a newborn pup who couldn’t even walk yet.

… But she COULD walk.  And run.  Pretty fast, too.  She’d outpaced Ryvel in tag.  Her arms weren’t very impressive, but her legs were strong.  Built like a Yotul’s, but proportionately stronger, more compact.  Straight, too.  When I’d met her, she walked like they were a little bent.  I did that too, to keep The Feds thinking I was crippled like the rest.  Now that we were alone, she walked with her legs straight.

How did she balance with that head of hers?

She twitched her tail.

Oh, right.  That would do it.  Her tail was longer than Mom’s: a good counterweight.  Even so, moving around required a good deal of coordination.  I knew she was coordinated, but was that enough?  Balancing on those petite paws should be somewhat difficult.

My gaze drifted down.  I was reminded that her legs and paws weren’t exactly petite, and the toes … the way they spread.  They almost looked like little fingers.

Something clicked.  The mumble tumbled from my mouth before I realized what I was saying.

*“Tree-dweller.”*

Rebra froze, then whistled a laugh.  “Are you likening me to a monkey?”

I fidgeted a little.  “Yes.”

She doubled over in laughter.  “Okay.  Why?”

“Can’t you read my mind?” I asked.

“No.  I really can’t,” she admitted.  “Your body language was cluing me in.  I believe I have a decent idea of your thought process, but I want *more.*  It’s like you implied earlier: as a Clever Venlil, my food is knowledge, and right now, I’m *starving* for the flavors of your mind.”

“Weird way of putting it, but okay,” I agreed.  “Your intelligence, prehensile tail, the toe fingers, the coordination, your acute vision and directional perception: all of that points to a tree-dweller who never quite left the trees.  It’s one of the reasons why primates are among the most intelligent creatures on Earth.  Navigating the branches is tricky work.  It requires a dexterous body and a competent mind.”

“So …?” she coaxed.

I glanced at the dark stripes around her wrist.  They were a lot like mine, but inverted.  Mine were white.

“So, [I don’t think you’re a Venlil,](https://youtu.be/zRxbbA1gWZc?si=2pfgKl_CwtNoxxwV&t=49) and neither am I,” I concluded.  “I never really felt like a Venlil.  My mind works differently.  Same with my emotions.  I look sort of like a Venlil, but that’s just the outside, isn’t it?  The quirks of your anatomy are even more extreme than mine.  I thought we were just super Venlil, cooked up in the lab as weapons against The Federation, but it’s more than that, isn’t it?  There’s some kind of *legacy* behind what we are.  The Shepherd said they Frankensteined my Clever and I back to life, so I guess we were alive once.  Then we weren’t.  Now we are again.  I don’t know how that works, but we’re definitely not Venlil.  That’s okay, I suppose, but if some normie Venlil fights better than I, what’s the point of being different?”

*“Yip!-Yip!-Yip!”*

Her hologram projector had spat out a tiny canine.  It scampered around the room, barking at everything and nothing.

“Is this a dog?” she asked.

“Yeah.  That’s a chihuahua,” I stated.

She worked the projector with her tail tip and it dumped out a much bigger canine.  Its thunderous barks rocked the room.

“Is this a dog?” she asked again.

“That looks like a Tibetan mastiff, so yeah,” I confirmed.

“They don’t quite look like family, do they?” she queried.

“True, but they both bark, growl and wag their tails,” I argued.  “Are you saying we’re like dog breeds?”

“Hm …” she hummed noncommittally.

The projector unleashed a new canine.  It bayed a piercing howl into the heavens.

Flinching, the chihuahua and Tibetan mastiff barked at the newcomer while keeping a healthy distance.  The new canine snarled, but never barked.  I wasn’t sure if it could.

“Is this a dog?” she pressed.

“It’s a wolf,” I declared.  “Different species.”

She projected a screen recording.  Based on the ‘Press X to skip’, I guess it was a cutscene from an old videogame.  The graphics weren’t bad, though.  The scene opened to a Terran wilderness.  Crouching in the snow were three wolf cubs and [a chihuahua](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/04K3K4) with intense eyes and an exoskeleton of all things.  It must have been some kind of prosthetic.  His hind legs seemed to be entirely mechanical.  That didn’t explain the oversized jet fists attached to his back.

“What’s this game again?” I asked.

“An adaptation of [Gone to the Dog,”](https://youtu.be/hblkTAx2iPY?si=eYpYq-RuxVqY0PDg) Rebra explained.

The cubs were putting on brave ears and tails, but I could see them shiver as they watched a moose out in the open.  An auroral storm surged and crackled about it as it stumbled around, drooling, erratically bucking at nothing.

“It has The Madness,” concluded one of the cubs.  “If we touch it, we could go crazy and die.”

“W-why did the pack send us on a hunt like this?” queried the smallest.  A runt from the looks of it.  He was starting to cower.

“Isn’t it obvious?” the female of the group asked.  Her voice was beginning to waver.  “This isn’t an initiation hunt.  We’re supposed to die!  We’re packless waste, and this is how they get rid of us!  They don’t want us!  They never did …”

“Then let’s make them want us.  I have a plan,” the chihuahua declared.  “Ranged attacks only.  Divide its focus.  If it gets too close to any one of you, ease off and let someone else press the attac-”

**“Who even asked** ***you?”*** snarled the first cub.

Subtle, auroral energy flared around him as he bared his teeth.

The cub was easily three times his size, but the chihuahua didn’t flinch.  He seemed vaguely unamused.

“If we’re rejects, what does that make *you?”* the cub growled.  “The pack doesn’t want you.  *We* don’t want you!  You think I didn’t notice?  You’ve barely got a trace of lifelight in you!  I can only scent it in those shiny things growing all over you!  What even *are* you?  Some kind of rat?”

“We’re the same species,” the chihuahua calmly explained.  “Dogs and wolves are subspecies of-”

“Y’know what?  I don’t care!” snapped the cub.  “The only reason why we haven’t eaten you is ‘cause you got no meat on your-!”

I didn’t see when the chihuahua moved, but his mechanical fist was in front of the cub’s face.  It surged with turquoise arcs of energy, charged at ready.

The cub froze.

The chihuahua closed his fist, dissipating the charge before patting the cub on the head.

“There’s nothing honorable about beating a cub,” he declared.  “Let’s not fight again.”

“… You took me off guard last time,” the cub argued lamely.

“Yes.  I did.  But that doesn’t matter,” the chihuahua asserted.  “If we want the pack to accept us, we need to prove that we’re worth accepting.  You are strong.  We can do this.  We just need to be smart and brave.”

“But we’re *cubs,”* the female protested.  “We shouldn’t have to prove that we’re worth wanting.”

“I know.  You shouldn’t, and it’s not fair, but that’s the world we live in,” sighed the chihuahua.  “The good news is we can win this.  I’ve seen what you guys are capable of.  You’re wolves, the strongest of all canines.  One day, you could be stronger than me.”

The cubs began to perk up.

“If you feel confident, stick around.  If not, you need to leave.  ***Now,”*** the chihuahua asserted.

**Krr-*****KOOOM!***

Manic, auroral lightning blazed from the sky.  The cubs cowered, only to notice the chihuahua’s bionic palm raised high, summoning a turquoise dome that shielded them all.

The cubs took a peek.  That mad moose was charging in.  Sickly lightning lashed out about it, torching snow to vapor.

The chihuahua’s jet fists screamed their thrust and he took off, skimming the snow as he blazed an arc around the moose.  Turquoise bolts blasted from his fists, rapid-fire.  They pounded the moose’s auroral shield, drawing the mad beast’s ire.  Forgetting the cubs, the moose raged after the chihuahua.

“He’s distracting it?” supposed the female.

The head cub snarled.  “Well, we can’t let Wave get all the credit.  You heard the rat!  We are *wolves!*  Ranged attacks only!  Divide its focus!  Let’s bring this monster down!”

Their auroras flared and they fanned out, projecting their bites with luminous blasts as they flanked the moose from every side.

The cutscene ended.

“… Do you have the actual game, or just the cutscene?” I asked.

“I have the actual game,” Rebra confirmed.

“How’s it handle?” I delved.

“Like Armored Core 6 crossed with Sonic Frontiers,” she shrugged.

“Sounds fun.”

“It is.”

…

“What were we talking about again?” I asked.  “Oh, right.  So, you’re saying we’re subspecies of Venlil?  Like wolves to dogs?”

She flicked an ear.  “Yes.  We are a subspecies of Venlil.”

She was preempting me again.  I’d been wondering if we were one subspecies, or two.  It was a strange thought.  Rebra was small.  I was big.  She was smart.  I was … less smart.  Opposites.  To think we were the same subspecies.  But, then again, plenty of animals had males and females that were polar opposites.  Was this a male/female thing, or a caste thing, like certain insects?

“How did the Venlil get subspecies?” I pressed.  “Before there were Venlil, there were Skalgans.  Between that, when did Venlil have the opportunity to diverge into a subspecies?”

“We *didn’t,”* she stated.  “You’re thinking in the wrong timeframe.”

Her projector released a sixteen-foot monster.  I had to crane my neck to see it all.  It was [that iconic shot from Jurassic Park,](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx38uXjP5xALp_VOgj3vqRe1OqY2lkajW5?feature=shared) when the T-rex roared her victory as the banner fell before her: *‘When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth’.*

My eyes widened just a bit.  It all made sense.

“We’re not just wolves in sheep’s clothing,” I breathed.  “We’re *dinosaurs*.  But we can’t be *authentic* dinosaurs.  If there ever was an ancient subspecies of Strongs and Clevers, they would have had to be Skalgans, but we’re *Venlil,* which means we were modernized, somehow.  That makes us Hollywood dinosaurs: the featherless kind that gives paleo fans reasonable crash outs.”

Rebra whistled a giggle.

“But why didn’t they just make us Skalgans?” I queried.

“Because you’ll never see our ancestors in the museums, not even the secret ones,” Rebra explained.  “The Federation buried our bones and legacies, deep under the bedrock where no one would *ever* find them.  Strongs and Clevers are *beyond* top secret, to the point where most of The High Herd doesn’t know what we really are.  Skalgans were tough enough as it was, but I have reason to believe that the Strongs and Clevers nearly dealt a death blow to The Federation.  They modernized us as Venlil because, one, it was easier.  Venlil DNA is damaged, so going the full way back to Skalgans could be tricky.  Two, they can’t identify us as resurgent Skalgans, because we’re not Skalgans.  With a little makeup and a shear, you could walk around on a Federation core world, and people would think you’re just an abnormally big Venlil.  Most people would think that if you went as you are.  A PD case, at worst.

“After what The Federation did to us, deformities and abnormalities are disproportionately common.  There are quite a few big Venlil out there.  I believe that’s a symptom of ancient genes attempting to resurface, but The Federation never did much about it.  I suspect that that’s because they *know* that they messed up our gene pool to the point where it’s virtually impossible for a subspecies to resurge properly.  Even if there are Venlil out there with strong traits of a dangerous, extinct subspecies, what would they even do?  They don’t know what they are, and they have no reason to wage war against The Federation.  The strength of our particular subspecies was our intelligence and physical power.  Working together, Strongs and Clevers were a recipe for era-defining warriors.”

She tilted her head.

I livened up a bit.

“Not bad!” Rebra commended.  “Two hundred and seventy nine words, and only *now* are you falling asleep!”

Oh.  She caught me.

“I’m still under the influence of the sedatives,” I defended.

“I know,” she agreed.

“Did you drop that wall of lore to test my mental stamina?” I asked.

“In part, this entire conversation is to test you,” Rebra admitted.  “There isn’t a failing grade per se.  I just want to understand you more thoroughly.  And yes: your mental stamina could use some honing.  A capacity for sustained focus will be key in going the distance.  I can train you.”

“That’s awful nice of ya, but no good deed goes unpunished,” I jested.  “I saw how fast you ran out of energy when you trained.  If we’re gonna fight as a team, you’ll need to go the distance too.”

She ear-smirked.

“Oh, you wanted me to train you, didn’t you?  That’s why you mentioned stamina.  You expected me to offer after seeing how quickly you tired out.  That was your way of asking without asking.  How much of this conversation have you mapped?”

“I feel like half your deductions about me are going to be just plain paranoia,” she quipped.

“You didn’t answer the question,” I grinned.

“The answer is yes,” she grinned back, looping her tail around the stable’s handle bars and lifting herself to my eye level.  “You teach me to be Strong, and I’ll teach you to fight Clever.  You’re gonna need a new base.  Their mistake was integrating Human martial arts into your E.A.T. training.  E.A.T. is a weak foundation.  We’re gonna have to rebuilt your fighting style from the ground up.  I think an adapted variant of Kyokushin karate would mesh with you, physically and philosophically.  Play it right and you’ll ^(En)git gud^(En) enough to beat The Shepherd.  Play it *really* right, and we’ll ^(En)git gud^(En) enough to beat an army.”

She scratched The Shepherd’s dried up spit off the stable glass.

My grin faded a bit.  “Rebra, I know you can think circles around me.  If you wanted to manipulate me, you probably could.  Even so, I want you to be honest: is there something you want?  Some reason why you’ve gone out of your way to reach out?  A motive, perhaps?  I don’t like owing people without knowing what they’re after.”

She looked a little hurt.  I almost regretted the question.

“You’re the only other member of my subspecies that I’m aware of, and you’re a good Venlil,” she stated.  “I want a friend … and … maybe a hug every now and then.”

“Heh, alright, I can do that,” I agreed.  “Hey, weird question: Is there any way to keep some of my battle scars from the Arxur fight?  I’m only scary-looking by Venlil standards.  Some sweet battle scars would take the fluff off my soft, fren-shape.”

Rebra gave me a weird but amused look before giving my healing wounds a once-over.  “Well, I know you like Superman.  I suppose some of those slash marks kind of look like an ‘S’ …”

**“YES PLEASE!!!”** I brayed.

She squeak-whistled a laugh.  “Okay.  I can coax the stable into leaving some scars, but that’s gonna give you a tactical disadvantage.  Your wool is pretty much body armor, you know.”

“Oh, *please,”* I snorted.  “What are the odds someone’s gonna land a critical hit in one of my scars?”

**--------------**

**Temporal Transposition:** *Date \[standardized human time\]: June 4th, 2140.*

**--------------**

*“Is this how she does it?”* mumbled the sheepdog.

Looking down, I found his paw deep in my gut.  He’d struck an old scar, unprotected by wool.  His ears and tail held an analytical expression, like he was solving a puzzle.

Even as the orange juice gushed from my gut.

Ha … haha … no.

“Who?  Lerai?” I asked.

Blinking, the sheepdog began to look up at me.  He was not expecting me to intuit the right answer.  He *definitely* was not expecting me to smoothly move my arm towards him as I finished the question.

He noticed it halfway all the same.

**--------------**

**Temporal Transposition:** *Date \[standardized human time\]: April 20th, 2123.*

**--------------**

“Oh, and [I got it,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrH38BNsUXI) Rebra added.

“Got what?” I asked.

She locked her paw into a knife hand position.  No, a *spear.*

“I figured it out,” she proudly proclaimed.

Oh.

***Ohhh!!!***

***YESSSSSSSS!!!***

**--------------**

**Temporal Transposition:** *Date \[standardized human time\]: June 4th, 2140.*

**--------------**

He’d noticed.  I had to go all in.  Muscles and bone locked in position as I accelerated my strike.

It didn’t come naturally for me.  The anatomy of a Common was best suited to the technique.  Better range of motion, but when push came to shove?  *Yeah.*

I could pull off *The Hunter’s Spear.*

The sheepdog’s ears startled up as my spear paw shot at him.  His shock was *delicious.*

I wanted *more.*

Then he veered.  Was he *dodging* me?  His reaction speed was amazing!

**--------------**

**Temporal Transposition:** *Date \[standardized human time\]: April 22th, 2123.*

**--------------**

“What comes to mind when you think of The Shepherd?” Rebra asked.

“… ‘Worthy opponent’,” I admitted begrudgingly.

“Dangerous choice,” she remarked.  “Right now, you’re a fighter.  The Shepherd’s a predator.  You chase the thrills.  He seeks the kills.  Predators don’t care about playing fair.  There is no honor.  They don’t stop to admire their enemies.  Every thought is geared to making the kill as fast as possible.  You can’t play with someone like him.  Your first attack should be your last attack.  Do *everything* to make that takedown fast and hard.  Respect them when they’re dead.”

“That’s dark,” I remarked.

“Yeah, but you can handle dark,” she assured.  “If there’s anyone I can trust with the darkest deeds, it’s gotta be you.  You’re good enough to touch the shadows without sacrificing your light.  You’ll have to be.”

**--------------**

**Temporal Transposition:** *Date \[standardized human time\]: June 4th, 2140.*

**--------------**

Alright.  Locking in.

My spear wouldn’t land.  He’d dodged it by a hair.

That hair was all I needed.

I opened my paw as it passed.  Snared his wool with my thumb and closed it fast.  At the speed my arm was moving, the little Venlil had to move with it.

My strike became a throw.  The sheepdog went flying.

It had been cycles, but Rebra’s training was kicking back in like an old habit.

Now to get rid of the handcuf-

A kantu kick cracked across the back of my skull.  At least, that was the intention.  It barely got through my wooly mane.

I looked back, just in time to see a Yotul tail vanish behind the counter.

… Coward.

Now the handcuffs.  Scarcely had I looked away before I heard the vaguest shuffling.  My gaze snapped back to the counter.

I caught half a Yotul disappearing behind it again.

Ah.  Opportunistic predator.

*Shhnk!*

It’d be funny if the sheepdog wasn’t burying his spears in my scars again.

**--------------**

**Temporal Transposition:** *Date \[standardized human time\]: April 23rd, 2123.*

**--------------**

“Dilate your pupils,” Rebra instructed.

I raised a brow.  “I can do that on command?”

“Yes.  Maybe.  I think so,” she supposed.  “You should be able to, but it’ll take practice.”

“Okay.  Why?”

“Same reason I do it,” she explained: “To take in more visual information.  Far as I can tell, your central vision is about 2.5 times that of a normal Venlil.  The area you can directly look at is greater than theirs.  My central vision is about 6 times greater.  It goes beyond that when I dilate my pupils.”

“So that’s how you’re so observant,” I surmised.

“That’s part of it,” she tail-shrugged.  “Now, I’m asking you to do that so you can *look without looking.*  Basic peripheral vision can only go so far.  You need to focus on more of your surroundings without cluing in your enemy by moving your pupils.  The eyes are the window to the thoughts.  If you can focus on your opponent without giving indications of focus, you can pull the perfect blindside.”

“Okay, but are you gonna suggest I shear my mane?  Y’know, to increase visual range?”

“Much like a lion, your mane is good head protection, so no,” she clarified.  “I’ll trust that natural selection left it there for a net positive.”

“Good.  ‘Cause I like my mane,” I grinned, fluffing it up.

“Heh, I like your mane too,” she agreed.  “Half the time, I’ll be your eyes and ears.  We Venlil Primals work best together.”

*“’Venlil Primals’?*  Is that what we’re called?”

“That’s what *I* call us,” Rebra clarified with smug ears.

“You cooked.  Keep cooking,” I beamed.

“I did, and I shall,” she giggled with a wiggle wag.

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Memory transcription subject: Lmur, Yotul Flame**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: June 4th, 2140.*

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

I peeked over the counter.  The big guy was too busy fending off Marjinl.

I vaulted over the counter, whirling a kick in one move.

He caught it.

Uh oh.  Not again.

“Brkar, *no,”* I squeaked.

**“Brkar,** ***YES!”*** he brayed.

My world spun as he swung me at Marjinl.  Great.  He’d catch me, or cushion the impact with his wooly body.  Wait, ***that JERK actually dodged me!***

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Memory transcription subject: Brkar, A Strong Venlil**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: June 4th, 2140.*

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

***BAHA!***  **That jerk actually dodged him!**

He leaped the Yotul’s body, rolling through the air towards me.  I could intuit that he was going for my neck.

Kyokushin Karate: *Tettsui mae yoko uchi* ***- Front sideways hammerfist strike.***

My fist smashed him from the air.

***“GUH!”***  He hacked the breath from his lungs and hit the ground hard, gagging for air that wouldn’t come.

*Fumikomi Geri* \- ***Stomp Kick.***

He rolled clear.  My foot cracked the tile.  He whirled to his feet, even with his diaphragm in phrenospasm, preventing breathing.

My kick chased him like a sunsprinter.

*Ushiro geri –* ***Back kick.***

A hit.  I could feel he’d almost dodged it, but that kick could kill three Venlil.  A glancing blow from a railgun was *still* a glancing blow from a railgun.

The sheepdog reeled to the ground, forced himself to his paws and knees, then flopped down again.  A sheepdog’s iron will could only take him so far when he couldn’t breathe, not to mention the blunt force trauma.  He could barely move.  Speaking of moving …

I hooked my free fingers into the handcuff, braced and ***wrenched.***

The handcuff snapped off.  I flexed my paws experimentally.  The liberated paw wasn’t quite as responsive.  It felt numbish.  Maybe a little nerve damage.  That sucked.

Based on the long, over-dramatic gasp, I’d say the sheepdog just learned how to breathe again.

“You done?” I asked.

He glared beneath his brow, still heaving.

I checked the wounds he’d made.  Funnily enough, he’d avoided my vitals.  *Twice.*  There were those split-moments of hesitation when he seemed to pause and calculate his strikes.  Was he trying to maim rather than kill?  Heh, here I was, trying to fight my best, while he was trying *not to.*  For a sheepdog, it must have been hard, but I didn’t trust his mercy to last.  I didn’t need to, now that I could fight with both arms.  Still, I felt like he deserved a chance.

“I’m going to kill you,” I sighed.  “If this keeps up, *I’m going to kill you.”*

“No …  *You,”* he gasped.

I scoffed a laugh.  “No U only works on Humans.”

“You’re going to bleed out … before the paw ends,” he wheezed.  “Stand down and we will give you … medical …”

“‘Before the paw ends’?” I snorted.

I tensed my muscles to slow the bleeding.

The sheepdog tilted his head.  ***\~What*** *in the name of* ***Baki?\~*** is what he’d be thinking, if he had any culture whatsoever.

“I think you’re confusing me with a Takkan,” I stated.  “Give yourself some credit.  We hail from Skalga, Land of Death.  We’re made of tougher stuff.”

The sheepdog forced himself back to his feet, paws snapping to Hunter’s Spears as he took the ancient stance.  “Are you a betting man?  Gamble your life?”

“Maybe,” I tail-shrugged.

“Then next time, I’m taking one of your kidneys,” he growled.

*Zenkutsu dachi –* ***Front Bent Stance.***

“Ain’t no next time, Ol’ Yeller,” I grinned.

**Memory transcription subject: Pikro, Gojid Barista**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: June 4th, 2140.*

**--------------**

Hunkered down in the back room, my ears perked up as the call finally went through to the guild.

“Hello!  I’m hearing loud noises in my shop,” I explained.  “It sounds like a Mazic’s picked a fight with ten Takkans!”

“Um … we’re sorry, Sir, but we’re in the middle of an emergency,” came a Venlil’s answer.  “W-we’ll send someone as soon as we can.”

“Is some aspect of that emergency localized to ‘Pikro’s Coffee Cradle’?” I pressed.

“… M-m-maybe?” the Venlil stuttered.  ""O-our best and brightest are already on site!  There's no need to dispatch any additiona-""

I ended the call.  They weren’t gonna be of much help.

Doing a breathing exercise, I psyched myself up.  “Alright.  Be brave.  Brave like a Human.”

I grabbed a mop stick and unscrewed the head.  A good enough weapon, right?

Peeking through the door, I assessed the situation.

Okay.  No Mazic.  No Takkans.  A giant Venlil was going toe to toe with two, brightly uniformed officers.  The giant tore a chair from the ground and hurled it at the Venlil before smacking the flying kicking Yotul into the ceiling.

… *Yyyeahhh,* nope.

Nope-nope-nope.

From the looks of it, the customers had the presence of mind to get out of there.  All except a pawful of Humans, who were catching it on their phones from the far corner.  Perhaps I should follow their example.  The sane ones.  Not the Humans.

… But this was *my* coffee shop.  I couldn’t let some random Venlil do what he wished with it, even if he was a Venlil!

I threw the door open and charged with a battle bellow.

The giant eyed me quizzically.

I swung the stick.

He caught it like a twig.

…

Oh!  I could swing the other end!  It seemed like a clever idea.  So, I swung it.

He caught it too.

…

I pulled.

His grip didn’t budge.  Then, staring me down the whole time, [he headbutted the stick in half.](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxeg-8BYMUAoXGyEKCE3fzcyT3fWRa5zRS?si=fi9ZWakActT-3Evh)

…

“Your coffee was good.  You should stick to that,” he suggested.  “Also, take the rest of the day off.”

Didn’t have to tell me twice.

I turned around and waddled out the door …

… briefly returning to flip the sign from ‘OPEN’ to ‘CLOSED’ before heading out and never looking back.

I'm 51 years young from the UK, and im just the bloke next door with grown up kids and a wife, on the surface we seem fine just like everyone else, but underneath things are not so great. 
I make no apologies for being who i am though, the older i get, i seem to care less about what people think or say these days. I'm more comfortable in my skin than ever before and i know what i like and what i dont like. I'm straight up honest and will say what's on my mind but at the same time, im empathic (sometimes it's a curse, and yes it's contradictory) and wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm prone to over thinking and sometimes worry about the little things in life, because the little things are actually really important.

**Things that i like:**  
*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

**Things i dont like:**  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

**My bad points:**  
*Over thinking, i have been called intense before, and i have a tendency to take things to heart.*

**Fun fact:**

Robot owners with Comandante: Do you also need to grind at 3-4 clicks?,"I finally received my Robot yesterday and I love the design, compactness, and simplicity of the workflow.

However, I've often heard that it was supposed to be hard to pull bad shots with this machine? But guess what? My first shots were catastrophic :D.

The Robot is replacing my Neo Flair Flex that I wanted to upgrade from. I also have a Comandante C40 MK4.

What surprised me was:

1. Even at very fine grinds (6-5 clicks on the Comandante), all the coffee flows out in 6-10 seconds at 2 bars!
2. Pre-heating was completely useless—actually worse, I got a burnt taste when I did it.

Note: I'm using 18g to 20g doses (I'm not using paper filters and I'm using medium to light roasted coffee).

Today I started changing things up:

1. To get the coffee to flow out in 25 seconds at 6 bars of pressure, I have to go down to 4, sometimes 3 clicks on my Comandante (and it becomes a real workout!)
2. I'm completely skipping pre-heating now.

Which leads to a lot better shots !

but do you also need to grind this fine with a Comandante?

With my Flair I had to be at 6-7 clicks, but I'm thinking that since the portafilter surface is wider (58mm Robot vs 47mm Neo Flair Flex), that would explain why you need to grind finer—but I'm not totally convinced by my own explanation.

I hesitated a lot between the Flair 58 and the Robot; I hope I didn't make the wrong choice haha

1ncg33u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ncg33u,Small kitchen = big mess… need ideas!,"Hello everyone :)

I live in a small apartment with very little storage space, especially in the kitchen. I have virtually no counter space, which quickly becomes cluttered with the dish rack, air fryer, blender, etc.

In front of my kitchen, I currently have a small cabinet that holds the microwave, toaster, and coffee maker. I would like to replace it with a longer freestanding shelf (industrial style or similar) to better organize my appliances: air fryer, coffee maker, microwave, toaster, blender, etc.

Next to the cabinet that holds the coffee maker, I have a small cupboard, but I'm not sure what to do with it. If you have any clever storage ideas for this small space, I'm all ears!

Ideally, I'm looking for tall storage, as I don't have anything on my walls and don't want to drill holes. I'm also open to other suggestions, such as replacing the small bookcase where my computer is with something more practical.

(Sorry for the mess in my photos 🙈)

I've attached a collage of my appliances and some inspirational photos.

What I'm looking for: ideas to help me feel less overwhelmed by the clutter. 

If you have photos of storage solutions or industrial shelving, I'd love to see your setups!☺️

Thank you! 🙏

But it has turned into a drag now, and **I am going to tell you why it's not worth spending your time on it.**

1. They started to push too hard to prove that the female lead is very smart. Every episode in their discussions, she would be the one to give a whole monologue of legal jargon that would apparently leave her fellow associates clapping. Yeah they would literally be clapping and Ooo Ahh -ing. So basically, in a table full of lawyers, no one had any good solution to offer other than her.  EVERY SINGLE TIME?? Also, this is not a conversation if one person is delivering their dialogue of 300 words in a monotonous voice.
2. The male lead is super charismatic, but he already lost points for me when I heard about the actors sexual assault allegations. If we ignore that and focus on the character. They basically forced down the audience's throat that he is also a very loving, caring man. In the start, he was brooding, giving it straight, no nonsense kind of guy but in the last 4 episodes, he has been acting kinda cringe with the twins. The whole babysitting them with Hyo-min, then taking them for an outing. I liked when they showed his caring side through Hash or his ex-wife, but this is very in-your-face.
3. I feel like the writer remembers that I need to show chemistry between these actors at the end of the episode. I understand that they have to act professionally at the office. But there is basically no subtle hints or anything. The male lead doesn't seem interested all day and then suddenly there is this one scene where he is staring at her with heart eyes.
4. The second couple has wayyy more chemistry, better storyline line but minimum to no screen time. However, you can watch their whole story from edits on YouTube, no need to sit through 12 episodes for that.
5. AD PLACEMENTS. OMG THE ICKK. This drama is filled with product placement. Specially, kopiko is soo overdone. From coffee shops to restaurants to even daily-use products. They should just put a list of products in the epilogue instead of making us listen to how this cream is making their hands softer or how this restaurant has big portions and the food is deliciousss. That too in the middle of a serious conversation.
6. The whole girl gang of Hyo-min. The girls are basically her side chicks. No chemistry between them either. Had to skip past most of their scenes. The female lead and her whole gang need some acting classes, too.
7. Why does every opposing party in their cases have to be represented by Lee and Seo, and that too by the female leads EX. Does this firm have only one lawyer? Ms. Kwon is a baddie no doubt. But this story line about kicking out Ms. Kwon and then planning revenge on her. It needs some serious convincing and proper buildup.
8. The drama had an open ending. Maybe because they want to make season 2. But sorry to say it has no potential to be dragged. I read somewhere that they were influenced by SUITS. It was very poorly done then.

Please don't hate on me. This is just my opinion. And yes I sat through all 12 episodes because I have a thing where I cant leave stuff in middle. When everyone ditched Riverdale, I still watched it. KILL ME :(( Let me know what you all think tho <3

The first picture was right after my surgery in 2022 when I had lost weight and muscle, leaving me very skinny. The second picture is recent; after consistent lifting and eating, I’ve gained ~ 18 kg and built noticeable muscle mass and strength.

Current Regimen
Weight training 6x a week (Shoulder & Biceps/ Glutesand Hamstrings/ Chest and Triceps/ Back / Quad focused legs/ cardio and mobility drill). 

Diet (High protein focus)
	•	Breakfast: Oats with milk, chia seeds, peanut butter, and whey protein
	•	Pre-workout: Black coffee + 1 banana.
	•	Post-workout: Whey protein shake 
	•	Lunch: 150–200 g chicken breast/paneer/soya chunks + 2 rotis or brown rice + dal + salad.
	•	Snack: Greek yogurt/Protein bar
	•	Dinner: Similar to lunch — protein source (chicken/soya chunk/paneer) + roti/rice + sabzi.

I keep sugar low (cut out sweets/soft drinks), focus on whole foods, and aim for ~1.6–2 g protein/kg bodyweight daily.

Goal
Initially: gain weight and muscle after being very skinny post-surgery.
Now: continue building muscle (especially quads and arms), while staying lean and strong.

1ncfxql,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ncfxql/build_quality_issues_eureka_single_dose_pro/,Build Quality Issues [Eureka Single Dose PRO],"I was really looking forward to using the Single Dose Pro since it was highly praised in the reviews. After I got it out, I was very pleased with how it looks and how it works. But after some time I found that there are lots of build quality things that are mindbogging at that price range around 650€. 

The paint of the rev counter dial is coming off fast, because it’s just paint on metal and the center piece is so tightly adjusted, that is scraps it right off. I disassembled it to maybe loosen it a bit but that made the whole casing so loud, that I needed to tighten the screw again (it seems it holds the top plate in its place too).

After that I found that with every unscrewing the paint on the black screw comes off and looks pretty shitty by now. Not a big deal but hey, 650€ for a grinder, that thing should look nice for some time right?

The third and last thing are the screws in general: Are Eureka screws always this soft? I ruined almost every screw by accessing the chamber and ruined one completely which didn’t let me access the burrs at all. After weeks of retrying I was able to unscrew it and replace it with a new set of screws I bought online. 

That leads me to the last thing that’s not related to the build quality but the service. I’m used to Baratza service quality, where you get in touch with the Customer service and they send you some screws and you can fix things (or offer to send things in). With eureka it’s like: Contact your shop, we don’t do anything! And the shop is not the fastest to send you a pack of screws for 4 bucks. 

Today the paint of the wheel is getting less and less and there is also no way of getting that wheel in case you want it to look great again in maybe a year or two. 

Update: Today the lid fell on the table from a few inches (after blowing) and the wood broke off. I will probably use the plastic one for now.

I love the coffee it makes but from a build perspective I probably would’ve gone with something that has higher production standards, even though they produce in China.

I’ve been researching for over two months, and I’m still stuck deciding. I live in Spain and my budget is under 1000€. I already tried the Ninja 701, but I returned it—it just wasn’t the right fit.

What I’m looking for:

* Great espressos and flat whites (I usually make 2 in a row, sometimes more if friends visit).
* A machine that’s reliable, easy enough for daily use, but also flexible for different coffee styles.

Where I’m stuck:

* **Lelit Victoria** → More features and definitely more capable, but it’s a single boiler. I’m worried that might be limiting when making back-to-back drinks.
* **Sage Bambino Plus** → Cheaper, but surprisingly capable. Many people say it punches above its weight, and I wonder if I really need to go for something more expensive.

What I’ve already ruled out:

* **Rancilio Silvia** → No PID.
* **Profitec Go** → Too expensive for my budget.
* **Sage Dual Boiler** → Also too expensive.

It just feels strange to me that the “cheaper” machine might actually be the better fit—and I’d love to hear from people who’ve used either (or both).

9. [Chococoorgspice](https://chococoorgspice.com/green-coffee-beans-coorg) \- Also expensive but the site looks better than (8) and atleast they say its premium grade.

I’ve been struggling a lot with loneliness and I could really use some advice.

In the past, I used to be very introverted, insecure, and even dealt with depression and a minor psychosis. Because of that, I didn’t make many friends. My financial situation is also not great, which makes it even harder.

The good news is that I’ve grown a lot—I’ve become more extroverted, I laugh, I joke, I talk more to people. But even with that progress, I still feel very lonely. I only have one really great friend, and I’m so grateful for him, but I also feel bad leaning on him too much for attention.

I’ve tried meeting people online (Facebook, chat sites, etc.), but it hasn’t worked out well. I don’t have a job, studies, or outside activities at the moment, so meeting people in person feels extra difficult.

What I’d love is to find friends here in Amsterdam—guys or girls—who are fine with enjoying the simple things in life, like taking a walk, having coffee at home, visiting a museum (I have free entrance with a Stadspas), that kind of stuff.

Do you have any advice for someone like me on how to actually make new friends here? Are there any groups, apps, or low-cost meetups in Amsterdam that you’d recommend?

Thanks a lot for reading and YES, I'm not gonna lie about it, I did polish my text with chatgpt(except for here on) because I'm not a great writer. But does that make me less worthy of friendship? I don't think so!

Anyways, thanks for reading and hopefully I'll find the help I've been wanting for years, because making friends while broke it's super hard, because personality wise I'm uplifting,  kind, funny at times and I always try my best to be a good friend to that one only friend I do have.

That’s what a COO told me over coffee last month.

Her company had been talking about AI for a year. They went to the conferences, read the hype, even tested a few tools. On paper, they looked prepared.

But when they rolled out their first AI-powered process, things went sideways:

1. Data was scattered across different systems.
2. No one knew who “owned” the AI project.
3. The team had no idea how to measure success.

Instead of speeding things up, it slowed them down.

And that’s the reality: **being excited about AI isn’t the same as being ready for AI.**

*NioCorp drilling for scandium, niobium near Elk Creek; planning to release analysis from exploratory project*

ELK CREEK, Neb. (WOWT) - Nearly [three years after its introduction](https://www.wowt.com/2022/11/18/rare-earth-metal-mining-coming-nebraska/) to the state, the company awarded millions in federal grants to establish a scandium mine in southeast Nebraska has finished exploratory drilling and is now ready to mine rare earth elements.

Last month, the U.S. Department of Defense, which the Trump administration now refers to as [the U.S. Department of War](https://www.wowt.com/2025/09/06/trump-executive-order-aims-rename-department-defense-department-war/), gave $10 million of its $336.4 million in designated production spending to Elk Creek Resources Corp., a NioCorp subsidiary, to establish domestic mineral production of [scandium](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-scandium.pdf), which strengthens aluminum alloys and makes them less susceptible to corrosion.

In a release sent Monday, Colorado-based [NioCorp](https://www.niocorp.com/) said it had completed the [Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project](https://www.niocorp.com/elk-creek-project/) initial drilling program it [started in April](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-to-initiate-drilling-program-at-elk-creek-project-in-order-to-support-updated-feasibility-study/).

“Scandium alloys are increasingly replacing titanium alloy and legacy aluminum alloy components in DoD systems due to their superior lightweight, high-strength characteristics,” a DoD spokesman said the Aug. 5 release.

The Elk Creek mine allows the U.S. government to create a domestic supply chain for defense system components, such as advanced propulsion systems, next-gen energy systems, and hypersonic weapons systems; and to build future aircraft.

“The last recorded scandium mining in the U.S. occurred in 1969,” the Aug. 5 DoD release states, noting then all scandium production was taking place in China.

NioCorp said Monday that the exploratory drilling in Elk Creek happened in two phases: [Phase I](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-completes-phase-i-of-field-drilling-campaign-at-its-nebraska-critical-minerals-project/), completed in August, involved more than 7,300 meters of drilling through 11 HQ diamond drill holes; four such drill holes were used during the second phase, reaching more than 2,200 meters.

NioCorp still has two HQ diamond drill holes in operation in areas where it plans to put underground mine access ramps. That geomechanical drilling will go an additional 1,950 meters.

In addition to scandium, NioCorp says crews are mining for [niobium](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/niobium-and-tantalum-statistics-and-information), an element used to make steel lighter and stronger; titanium, and other [rare earth](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/rare-earths-statistics-and-information) elements.

Until recently, niobium had to be imported into the U.S.; that changed when NioCorp started the project in 2022 to mine for it on the property in Elk Creek, with the goal of moving to commercial operation.

NioCorp said in its release Monday that it plans to release the results of [processing and analysis](https://www.wowt.com/2021/12/14/proposed-nebraska-mine-might-produce-more-rare-elements/) of the exploratory drilling program to the public.

**“We will examine the final assays and analyses of the drill core sampling program, but at this stage, I am confident that we will achieve the goals we set for this drilling campaign,” NioCorp CEO and Chairman Mark A. Smith said in Monday’s news release. “This will help move our debt financing process forward with the EXIM Bank.”**

Construction of the plant was expected to begin in 2023 and take three years to build. First Alert 6 was told in 2022 there would be 1,200 construction jobs to start with and 450 permanent mining jobs.

Company officials have also stressed the project would happen with a big focus on the environment.

# SEPT. 8th 2025~The draft US critical minerals list: Clearer priorities, persistent challenges

[The draft US critical minerals list: Clearer priorities, persistent challenges | PIIE](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/draft-us-critical-minerals-list-clearer-priorities-persistent)

https://preview.redd.it/x4hevy9514of1.png?width=1542&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd7c3ce0ca4cf4232ba37fdd6c18ecae5078139a

Since 2016, the United States has sought to reduce its economic and national security vulnerabilities related to critical minerals, a broad grouping of minerals important for industry and national defense, that the United States is highly import dependent upon and/or that have fragile domestic supply chains. This import dependence renders the US economy vulnerable to supply disruptions, coercion by suppliers, and even [natural disasters at home ](https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/commodities/sibanye-stillwater-halts-montana-mines-amid-floods-idUSL8N2Y12IY/). The US Geological Survey (USGS) publishes a list of the critical minerals it deems vital to the US economy and national security to guide related federal policy decisions, such as on mining investments, tax incentives, and mining permits. In 2022, the USGS listed 50 minerals. The 2025 draft lists 54, including copper, silicon, lithium, and zirconium.

I’ve argued before that [the US critical minerals strategy needs clearer priorities ](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2023/us-strategy-critical-minerals-needs-clearer-priorities). With a [revised methodology ](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20251047/full)informing the 2025 USGS draft list, we now have a firm basis for prioritization—with two important caveats: The monetary benchmark for inclusion on economic grounds is too low, and the list does not explicitly consider environmental or national security needs—which are the ultimate goals critical US mineral policy is meant to address.

# What are critical minerals, and how do they become “critical”?

Interest in critical minerals—a term that entered the modern lexicon in 2017[ ](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/draft-us-critical-minerals-list-clearer-priorities-persistent#_ftn1)—rose steadily in the 2020s before exploding in 2025. Associated in the popular imagination with [energy transition–intensive materials ](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/08/the-energy-transition-is-creating-a-historic-materials-transition-heres-why/)like lithium, cobalt, and nickel, the term “critical mineral” also covers heavy rare earth elements used in [semiconductors and national security applications ](https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions). More broadly, it refers to minerals for which the [United States is highly import dependent and/or susceptible to a single point of failure (SPOF, i.e., one facility closes and the whole supply chain stops) in its US domestic supply chain ](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2021/1045/ofr20211045.pdf).

Critical minerals have loomed large in the second Trump administration’s foreign policy: They have been [central to trade talks with China ](https://apnews.com/article/trade-minerals-rare-china-trump-5f7c9b9360cfb3cce702649e0c568a0e)and the [subject of weaponized Chinese export controls ](https://www.wtwco.com/en-gh/insights/2025/01/collateral-damage-in-semiconductor-supply-chains), US attempts to [broker peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo ](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/why-us-drc-minerals-security-deal-could-backfire), [US negotiations to continue supporting Ukraine’s war effort ](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/01/world/what-we-know-about-trumps-ukraine-mineral-deal-intl), and [Trump’s covetous stance toward Greenland ](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-greenland-trump-deals/). Through now three congressionally mandated updates, the list has included materials with common uses such as aluminum and others with such rarified uses (such as rhenium) that even specialists may not have heard of them.[ ](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/draft-us-critical-minerals-list-clearer-priorities-persistent#_ftn2)Critical mineral status matters because it unlocks a suite of US government interventions, including Defense Production Act–related benefits, tax credits for domestic production and refining, and national stockpiling.

The new methodology is a departure from past practice. The 2022 list relied mainly on supply concentration, trade reliance, and import dependence metrics, which flagged minerals as critical if the United States was highly reliant on a small number of suppliers. In contrast, the 2025 methodology models probability-weighted GDP losses from (1,200 different) simulated one-year supply disruptions, producing an explicit economic risk expressed as projected losses to US GDP. It thus moves from static reliance indicators to a scenario-based, impact-driven framework.

The new operational definition of a critical mineral is now one for which a probability-adjusted[ ](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/draft-us-critical-minerals-list-clearer-priorities-persistent#_ftn3)one-year import supply disruption or domestic SPOF would result in a GDP loss of at least $2 million.

This new methodology is a massive improvement over earlier iterations. It refocuses attention on actual impacts versus theoretical exposure, its probabilistic approach to supply disruptions does not default to worst-case scenarios, and it facilitates cost-benefit analysis. But the resulting list is still overly inclusive and subject to the perennial challenge of accounting for externalities.

# The list is too long—but helps establish clear priorities

The $2 million GDP loss estimate cutoff amount is a lot of money in many contexts but not relative to the US economy. US GDP is presently $30.35 trillion a year; a $2 million loss would constitute 7 millionths of 1 percent of annual GDP. For a sense of scale, these are losses typically associated with a [medium-sized restaurant fire ](https://www.salemreporter.com/2025/08/18/cause-undetermined-on-fire-that-did-2-million-in-damage-to-vacant-east-salem-sharis/). There are thousands of such fires in the United States annually, and they are not discussed—even their combined impact—as if they were consequential to the macroeconomy.[ ](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/draft-us-critical-minerals-list-clearer-priorities-persistent#_ftn5)The table below demonstrates how the 2025 list—currently 54 minerals long—shrinks significantly at higher economic impact thresholds. At amounts exceeding $1 billion, the list comprises just six minerals—samarium, rhodium, lutetium, terbium, dysprosium, and gallium—all of which are small-volume inputs that enable massive downstream industries: defense, semiconductors, medical imaging, and electric vehicles. At amounts exceeding $500 million, the list would comprise nine; at greater than $100 million, just 20.

https://preview.redd.it/smg7agjd14of1.png?width=1073&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e3bc8593a3285bd0600ed52359d897e05d02a8b

This distinction is important for prioritizing scarce resources. While the new USGS methodology ranks minerals according to economic risk, most of the legislative and executive perks tied to the “critical” designation—tax credits, accelerated permitting, and Defense Production Act–related benefits—are binary: A mineral is either on the list or it isn’t. That is, for most policy purposes samarium (with an average modeled GDP loss of $4.5 billion) and chromium chemicals ($2 million) are on equal footing. The USGS methodology produces a continuum of criticality; the policy environment treats it as an on/off switch. The 2025 methodology acknowledges this, offering a “statistical risk” categorization ranging from “high” to “elevated” and “moderate” to “limited.” But the “high” category still includes materials (like potash and rhodium) whose economic impacts differ by an order of magnitude.

# Accounting for externalities

“Don’t talk price until you’ve established value” is an oft-mentioned key to success in sales. The new methodology establishes the price of disruption but does not consider harder-to-model nonmonetary values.

This challenge is most evident in two areas: renewable energy and national defense. The value propositions of renewable energy and national security far surpass their economic contributions to GDP. The modeled cost of a lithium supply disruption from China is $34 million. But this does not account for the noneconomic benefits of downstream technologies like lithium-ion batteries, which enable us to live mobile-yet-digitally-connected lives and transition to renewable energy.

To the extent that a supply disruption were to slow US clean energy adoption and electric vehicle sales,[ ](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/draft-us-critical-minerals-list-clearer-priorities-persistent#_ftn6)it would slow adoption of technologies that produced [air-quality and health benefits valued at $249 billion (2019–22) and prevented 1,200 to 1,600 premature deaths ](https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/articles/study-finds-air-quality-and-environmental-benefits-recent-wind-and-solar)in 2022 alone. These kinds of considerations do not inform the USGS methodology because the model only accounts for market-mediated GDP losses as represented in input-output tables.

The same logic holds for national security. Two-inch gallium nitride (GaN) substrate—the base layer for building epitaxial semiconductor films used in advanced radar arrays and lasers—[may only cost about $1,300 ](https://www.metal.com/Indium-Germanium-Gallium/202210140001)a piece, but the US Navy’s [AN/SPY-6 advanced radar system ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/SPY-6)(unit cost approximately $90 million to $100 million) cannot provide its essential function of air and missile tracking without it. Given the importance of these downstream systems, the higher costs would be eaten—demand is price inelastic.

But demand for other systems that depend on critical minerals—like precision-guided munitions, drones, and night vision goggles—is more price elastic. One fewer set of night vision goggles deployed might not sound consequential—but tell that to the spouse of a soldier killed during a nighttime ambush. Focusing narrowly on GDP losses risks misunderstanding the true importance of materials whose principal value is in providing national security or mitigating climate change.

These criticisms seem logically inconsistent: Pricing is good, but pricing doesn’t give us the whole picture. But they point in the same direction: revising the methodology to attempt to price—or at least value—these positive externalities and/or the avoidance of negative ones. A layer of analysis that accounts for health, environmental, and security externalities—using Environmental Protection Agency assessments of avoided mortality and Department of Defense assessments of mission risk, for example—could augment the new (as of 2025) approach.

The 2025 update to the USGS critical minerals list and the methodology underpinning it provide a clear, quantifiable basis for prioritization. But this clarity comes at the cost of undervaluing the noneconomic contributions of these minerals to our shared prosperity, safety, and health. Unless policymakers integrate the noneconomic values of these minerals, we risk a US critical minerals strategy that misses the forest for the trees.

# Boeing’s F-47 NGAD Fighter Could Be Flying ‘Sooner Than People Think’

[Boeing’s F-47 NGAD Fighter Could Be Flying ‘Sooner Than People Think’](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/boeing-s-f-47-ngad-fighter-could-be-flying-sooner-than-people-think/ar-AA1M8Q0g?ocid=msedgntp&pc=HCTS&cvid=22542bd741f248f4a01409689dfdc8a3&ei=14)

**Key Points and Summary -** A top Boeing executive has announced the U.S. Air Force’s sixth-generation F-47 NGAD fighter could be flying ""sooner than planned,"" a major development in the technological race with China.

\-The accelerated timeline is credited to massive private investment and R&D by Boeing, which is already building new production facilities.

This is seen as a direct response to China's aggressive air force modernization, including its own 6th-gen programs.

\-The early arrival of the F-47 is a crucial part of a broader U.S. strategy to maintain its air dominance over a rapidly advancing adversary.

# F-47 Coming Sooner Than Planned Amid Race With China

China’s hopes of becoming the[ first to field a sixth-generation fighter](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/j-36-vs-f-47-which-6th-generation-ngad-fighter-will-be-first/) may have been dashed, as Boeing executive [Colin Miller](https://www.ainvest.com/news/boeing-defense-renaissance-strategic-leadership-innovation-position-long-term-growth-2506/) says the F-47 could arrive much sooner than people think.

# NGAD Data - Boeing is Talking F-47 Fighter

Miller, the vice president and general manager of Boeing’s Phantom Works division, said on August 29 that the [sixth-generation](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/boeings-f-47-ngad-the-last-manned-air-force-fighter/) F-47 aircraft could be in the air “faster than normal.”

The comments came during a fireside discussion at a conference hosted by the National Defense Industrial Association.

[The Boeing executive also said](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/03/boeing-phantom-works-f47-schedule) that people would “be surprised by how fast” they see the F-47 flying, indicating that plans to field the aircraft no later than 2029 have likely been brought forward. Miller did not, however, provide details about how quickly the next-generation jet could be seen.

# The Fighter Future Is Now

Both [Boeing](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/the-boeing-f-15ex-eagle-ii-fighter-is-back/) and the U.S. government have remained upbeat about the prospects of fielding the F-47 - Boeing’s winning design for the U.S. Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program - in the near future. The Trump White House [prompted criticism in July](https://breakingdefense.com/2025/07/funding-f-a-xx-could-delay-f-47-white-house-warns-congress/) when it released a formal statement expressing concern about the building capacity of the United States’ industrial base. The White House recommended a reevaluation of the F/A-XX program citing concerns that simultaneous development could delay the F-47 program.

“Awarding the F/A-XX contract as written is likely to delay the higher-priority F-47 program, with low likelihood of improving the timeline to field a Navy sixth generation fighter,” the statement reads.

In recent weeks, however, funding that was temporarily suspended to prioritize the F-47 has been restored - with $1.4 billion [approved by the Senate](https://www.msn.com/en-ie/money/technology/u-s-navy-advances-in-development-of-f-a-xx-fighter-after-senate-restores-funding/ar-AA1LFEMI) to ensure the Navy’s next-generation program can proceed. The news suggests that fears over the United States’ industrial capacity may have been overblown, or that Boeing’s investment in NGAD has been substantial enough to not only ensure both programs succeed, but to make the F-47 a reality sooner than planned.

# A Massive Boeing Investment 

As part of his recent fireside discussion, Miller described how a combination of a “huge, tremendous investment” in the project from Boeing along with “constant R&D” has allowed the team to move forward more rapidly. The Boeing executive revealed how the company is not only on track to deliver the first F-47 sooner than planned, but that efforts are underway to speed up the rate of F-47 manufacturing.

“If you’re ever in St. Louis, you’ll see the buildings going up, and we’re well ahead on that, because we had to be, to be ready to meet the commitments for what our customer needs,” Miller said. “We’re 100 percent resourced and ready to deliver.”

# China Is Watching

The news comes as China continues its efforts to dramatically improve its air force with the procurement of a large fleet of fifth-generation platforms and the development of “loyal wingman” drones, unmanned stealth aircraft, and its own sixth-generation platform.

[Reports suggest](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/chinas-j-20-fighter-makes-us-air-force-generals-freak-out-210421) that China is aiming for as many as 1,000 [J-20 fifth-generation aircraft](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/chinas-j-20-and-j-35-stealth-fighters-issue-warning-to-u-s-military/) by the 2030s, while around 50 new carrier-capable [J-35 stealth fighters](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/china-to-showcase-j-20-and-j-35-fighters-in-real-war-scenario/) are being manufactured every year. China is posturing to grow its fifth-generation inventory quickly this decade, while pursuing the rapid deployment of its sixth-generation J-36 and scaling manufacturing quickly once it is complete.

News that the United States will see the F-47 fly sooner rather than later could well be a direct response to China’s efforts. Regardless of whether the U.S. is racing to beat China to be the first to field a sixth-generation fighter, however, the news comes as the White House works to increase its own inventory of fifth-generation aircraft.

The Trump administration has prioritized rapidly expanding U.S. air capabilities to maintain edge over China’s ambitious fighter buildup, with a focus on expanding capabilities with existing platforms. For example, the FY 2026 Pentagon budget requested increased the planned F-15EX 4.5-generation fleet from [98 to 129 aircraft](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/the-f-15ex-eagle-ii-is-the-energizer-bunny-of-fighter-jets/), marking a clear increase in force capacity by leaning on trusted platforms upgraded with modern equipment. The F-15EX features a modernized self-protection suite, an increased payload capacity, and lower operating costs - all of which make it a compelling option as the Air Force awaits the arrival of more fifth-generation aircraft and the sixth-generation F-47.

The news followed the signing of an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/modernizing-defense-acquisitions-and-spurring-innovation-in-the-defense-industrial-base/) in April 2025, in which President Donald Trump ordered the modernization of defense acquisitions and the acceleration of current procurement efforts.

And, while the Air Force’s F-35 purchases are slated to drop to 24 in FY 2026, down from 51 in 2024, the procurement of cost-effective platforms like the [F-15EX Eagle II](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/the-f-15ex-eagle-ii-is-the-energizer-bunny-of-fighter-jets/) serves as a bridging strategy as the Air Force awaits the F-47. The strategy mirrors China’s own drive to scale its 5th-generation fleet rapidly.

If the United States beats China to the finish line, and quickly fields 185 F-47s in the years following first flight, it will not be a symbolic victory but a [substantive](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/j-20-mighty-dragon-vs-f-47-ngad-fighter-summed-up-in-4-words/) and necessary one.

# ****A Quick Reminder: Some Sort of NGAD Has Already Flown

While it is often overlooked in breaking news regarding the F-47, the Air Force confirmed in 2020 that some NGAD fighters had been [flying](https://www.defensenews.com/breaking-news/2020/09/15/the-us-air-force-has-built-and-flown-a-mysterious-full-scale-prototype-of-its-future-fighter-jet/). One would have to assume this was a [technology demonstrator](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/forget-chinas-new-j-36-stealth-fighter-america-flew-a-6th-generation-ngad-years-ago/), and not the new F-47 Boeing is working on.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

# NioCorp = The Flagship U.S. Critical Minerals Project

***With Scandium-Aluminum alloys written into Gen VI fighter jet designs, NioCorp positions itself as the Pentagon’s DFARS supplier. Titanium talks with U.S. majors, Stellantis circling REEs, and DoD-backed scandium metal demonstrations all point to one thing: Elk Creek is no longer just a mine — it’s a cornerstone of America’s future industrial and defense base.***

# RECAP of ""The real signals & Bombshell"" that came out of Mark’s Wainwright talk:

# 🛑 1. Titanium

* **Confirmed:** talks with *three* U.S. majors. That’s the supply chain gap (aerospace, defense coatings, alloys).
* **Read-through:** Niocorp is positioning itself as a domestic TiCl₄/TiO₂ anchor, and that’s squarely in the **DoD/DOE wheelhouse**. A major U.S. titanium producer (think **TIMET/ATI** or even **Chemours** for TiCl₄) could lock in here.

# 🛑 2. Rare Earths / Stellantis

* **Stellantis drama** → slowed by management reshuffles, but “back on track.”
* **Read-through:** Stellantis is *still live*. They want *all* REEs. If the DFS proves scale and recovery, Stellantis could come in with a **multi-metal anchor offtake.**

[One of the Defining \\""GoTo\\"" minerals to be mined, processed & vertically integrated into Scandium Aluminum Alloys!](https://reddit.com/link/1ncfpby/video/l70xjha654of1/player)

# 🛑 3. Scandium Metal Demonstration

* **DoD involved** → using two different methods to produce scandium metal.
* **NanoScale-like tech** strongly suggests collaboration with **Ames Lab / Nanoscale Powders** type pathways.
* **First Metal Nov 2025.** That’s basically a **demo milestone** that could trigger direct DoD procurement & validation.

# 🚨 Game-changer alert for Niocorp 🚨 ~BELOW~

# 🛑 4. ScAl Alloy + Gen VI Fighters (**🔥 HUGE)

* **Direct quote:** Working with a **DoD prime contractor** on Sc-Al alloy integration.
* **Gen VI fighter → 360° view, doubled threat detection, range boost.**
* This is an **operational security tell** — ScAl alloys are already in classified development pathways for NGAD (Next Gen Air Dominance).

# ****Mark teased a partnership soon. That’s your strategic bombshell!!!!

# 👉 Who could it be?

* Likeliest candidates:
   * **Lockheed Martin (LMT):** NGAD prime contractor, already under a $9.8B missile award, heavy need for lightweighting & heat resistance.
   * **Northrop Grumman (NOC):** Also leading Gen VI tech dev.
   * **Boeing Defense (BA):** Tied to future airframes, but less dominant than LMT/NOC here.

# ✈️ Lockheed Martin (LMT)

* **Prime on NGAD (Air Force version).**
* Already winning stealth/alloy/material integration work.
* Heavy push for **scalable ScAl alloys** → lightweighting + stealth + heat management.
* Lockheed’s known for integrating **classified materials early** into black programs (F-117, F-22, F-35).

# ✈️ Boeing Defense (BA)

* **F/A-XX / Navy NGAD lead.**
* Boeing already won the **F-47 (drone wingman / MQ-25 style).**
* Navy pushing HARD for fielding **sooner than Air Force** (threat window).
* Boeing loves “materials differentiation” as a wedge to claw back relevance against Lockheed.
* If Boeing locks down **exclusive ScAl integration** → they leapfrog in Navy NGAD.

# 🔑 Strategic Read

* **If Mark teases “Gen VI fighter + ScAl alloy”** → that covers both NGAD variants (Air Force **and** Navy).
* The fact that he said **“partnership announcement soon”** makes me lean **Lockheed first** — they’re usually the *earliest in* on novel alloys, and they have the Title III muscle to pull DoD along.
* BUT Boeing is *desperate* for an edge vs. Lockheed — and their Navy NGAD + drone portfolio *screams* for ScAl lightweighting and 360° sensor fusion.

# 🚀 NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project: From Wainwright to RedChip, Momentum Builds

**IMHO \~** *Following today’s Wainwright presentation, NioCorp has entered its most pivotal phase yet. Mark Smith confirmed Phase 1 drilling is complete with assays expected mid-to-late October, a resource update on deck, and a Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study that could reset the project’s scale across scandium, niobium, titanium, and rare earths. Importantly, he disclosed U.S. titanium negotiations with three major domestic players, progress with Stellantis on REEs, and two scandium metal demonstration paths with DoD — targeting first metal by November. Most eye-popping: confirmation that a DoD prime is working directly with NioCorp on* ***Sc-Al alloys for Gen VI fighter jets***\*, a breakthrough that makes Elk Creek a linchpin in America’s defense transition.\*

*Strategically, Elk Creek is backed by unmatched tailwinds: a $10M DoD Title III award, ongoing EXIM Bank financing engagement, and recognition across the CHIPS Act, DOE’s $1B critical minerals program, and DPA mandates. The Pentagon’s quiet but clear validation of scandium’s role — lightweighting alloys that double threat detection, extend range, and enable 360° pilot awareness — cements NioCorp’s reputation as the* ***“Saudi Arabia of Scandium”*** *and the* ***Pentagon’s DFARS supplier***\*. Ernest Cleave’s arrival to drive financing and offtakes only accelerates the shift from development to execution.\*

*With RedChip set for Thursday at 4:15 PM EST, drill results around the corner, and potential partnerships on the horizon, the setup couldn’t be stronger. Investors should recognize Elk Creek is no longer just a mine-in-the-making — it is fast becoming* ***the flagship U.S. critical minerals project***\*, uniquely positioned to deliver Sc, Nb, Ti, and REEs at scale.\*

*By 2028, Niocorp could redefine America’s resource independence — and this week may be remembered as the turning point where the story shifted gears*.

I've been dating but haven't found the person who I'm willing to settle down with. Maybe I'm in the wrong country. Maybe my person is still married or in a relationship with somebody and has yet to find their way to me. Maybe it's you.

**About me:** I'm a strong, independent woman. I'm an introverted extrovert. I like being with friends and meeting new people, but also like to stay home and recharge my batteries just basking in the silence. I like cooking and love brewing coffee in the morning. Other hobbies include watching films and series, reading books, running marathons, and traveling to new places. I have somewhat a demanding job and my schedule can be quite unpredictable. I'm based somewhere in Eurasia at the moment, but I will be based in my home, the Philippines, again in 2027 for a few years, then I will be off to another place. Hopefully you can come with and join the adventure.

**Hopefully you:** An open communicator, willing to try things at least once, has a clear sense of self, kind, funny, can bring something to the table.

1ncfkpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/comedywriting/comments/1ncfkpw/gift_of_the_maga/,GIFT OF THE MAGA,"Eighty-seven dollars. That’s it. And sixty of it was in quarters. Quarters saved one or two at a time checking the couch cushions at her parents’ home when she’d go over to watch Hannity with them. Three times Karen Liberty counted it. Eighty-seven dollars. And the next day would be Flag Day. Flag Day, but more importantly, President Trump’s birthday.
There was nothing to do but flop her head down on her My Pillow and howl. So Karen did it. While the lady of the trailer-house gradually moves from sobs to sniffles and finally back to a manufactured smile, take a look at her doublewide.
A red, white and blue threadbare couch. On the wall, a watercolor of President Trump signing an executive order while our lord Jesus Christ looks over him. American flag drapes keep the summer rays from yellowing further the already faded star pattern wallpaper. More clutter than an episode of hoarders, but all kept because you never know when the 4Patriots cans of food will be needed.
Karen, now her distress at bay, stood at the window and looked out dully at her neighbor’s trailer across the way. Looked like Bob had added a life size cardboard figure of Elon Musk to stand next to the one of President Trump. She knew envy was a deadly sin, but she felt it just the same. 
Tomorrow would be the President’s birthday and she had only eighty-seven dollars to buy Ron a present. She had been saving every dollar she could for months, with this result. She’d spent many a happy moment planning for it and knew what she wanted to get Ron. The gold plated “Make America Safe Again” rifle scope she had seen advertised in the NRA’s Shooting Illustrated. It would really make Ron happy, she knew, but the list price was two hundred and twenty-two dollars, in honor of the most important Constitutional amendment of all and all she had was eighty-seven.
Now, there were two possessions of the Liberty household in which they both took a mighty patriotic pride. One was Ron’s assault rifle that had been his father’s and his grandfather’s. The other was Karen’s collection of MAGA hats, most in the traditional red but others also in sparkly gold and pink. She waddled through the mess of the front room to the bedroom and opened the closet. There they were. Her seventeen MAGA hats. Grimacing, she knew what she needed to do.
She changed out of her camo PJs and put on her mostly clean “He can grab THIS pussy” t-shirt and headed across the way to Bob’s place clutching her seventeen hats.
Bob popped out like some trailer park Jack-in-the-box fingering one of the two holstered Desert Eagles at his hips.
“Karen! You can’t go sneaking up on a man’s homestead like that! Might get your head blown off!”
“Relax, Bob. Will you buy my hats?” asked Karen.
He smiled.
“You bet your ass I will.”
The next day dawned a glorious one. The sun shone extra golden, just to honor the commander-in-chief.
Bob got up before Karen to get the celebratory breakfast made. Red, white and blue Poptarts today, in observance of the double holiday. He popped in a couple, turned on the Mr. Coffee and went out to his truck to bring in Karen’s gift.
He placed the four-foot tall present next to their dining room table.
Karen awoke to the smell of coffee and Poptarts, slid out HER gift from under the bed and met Ron in the front room.
“Happy Birthday to President Trump, baby!” she said and handed him the wrapped rifle scope.
Ron, beamed.
“Happy Birthday to him, hun!” he said and pointed to her gift.
“For me?”
“Do liberals kill babies?”
She smiled, ripped apart the paper and looked puzzled.
She stared at a five shelve glass cabinet.
“For your hat collection, hun!”
“Oh, Ron. Oh sugar. I sold them to buy your gift.”
Now it was his turn to look puzzled. He opened his present and his eyes watered up when he saw it.

1ncfidu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_aristosourcing/comments/1ncfidu/how_to_make_your_facebook_fans_actually_care/,How to Make Your Facebook Fans Actually Care About You (Without Begging),"Okay, let’s be real. Most of your Facebook followers couldn’t care less about your posts. They scroll, like, and move on. But here’s a little secret: put them in an exclusive Facebook Group, and suddenly, they might actually pay attention. Shocking, I know.

According to Sprout Social, 64% of people want brands to connect with them on social media. Yeah, apparently we humans crave connection… even when it comes from a brand trying to sell us stuff.

# Why Your Public Page Sucks

Look, your public Facebook page? It’s basically a billboard no one looks at. Posts get buried, engagement drops, and your brilliant ideas disappear into the void. Private groups? That’s where the magic happens.

Brands like Peloton and Sephora have private groups filled with superfans who post sweaty selfies or product reviews like their lives depend on it. And the result? Members are 58% more likely to buy again. Emotional connection drives loyalty, and Harvard Business Review says emotionally connected customers have a 306% higher lifetime value. That’s right—people actually pay more if they feel like they “belong.”

# Personalized Experiences = People Actually Giving a Damn

Facebook Groups let you make your followers feel special without actually having to, you know, be their best friend. Run polls, ask questions, post tips—basically, trick them into thinking their opinions matter. According to Epsilon, 80% of customers prefer personalized experiences. Who knew people liked being catered to?

You can even split groups into threads based on interests—like skincare types, fitness goals, or coffee preferences. Tailored content = more engagement = more purchases. Simple math. And if you think your followers won’t brag about your brand to friends? Think again. Engaged members turn into mini-marketing machines.

# Retention: Keep Them Coming Back for More

Retention is everything. Bain & Company says a 5% increase in customer retention can boost profits by 95%. That’s not a typo. A tiny bump in retention can basically double your earnings.

How do you keep them engaged? Post updates, offer group-exclusive deals, run discussions, and be “responsive.” PwC says 73% of consumers say a good experience influences brand loyalty. So yes, a Facebook Group can make your followers feel cared for while subtly nudging them to spend more.

# Virtual Assistants: Your New Best Friend

Managing a Facebook Group is exhausting. Enter: virtual assistant. These legends can approve new members, moderate comments, respond to questions, and even schedule posts. Need someone to answer “Does this shirt come in blue?” while you sip coffee? Done.

HubSpot even reports that businesses responding quickly to inquiries can increase conversions by 30%. A VA can also create engagement content, spotlight members, and track analytics. Basically, they make sure your group doesn’t become a dead zone of tumbleweeds and spam memes.

# Proof

Sephora’s “Beauty Insider Community” lets fans gush, share tips, and sneak a peek at new releases. Peloton’s groups? People post their progress, cheer each other on, and keep coming back. Even small businesses can do it—a local coffee roaster can have enthusiasts talking about brewing techniques and seasonal blends.

The formula: consistent engagement + personalized content + VA support = a group full of loyal, buying members.

# TL;DR

Facebook Groups are the secret weapon for turning casual followers into loyal, paying fans. Give them exclusive access, tailor experiences, keep them engaged, and hire a virtual assistant to handle the boring stuff. Members feel special, your brand gets loyalty points, and you profit. Everyone wins.

So go ahead; start your group, make people feel like VIPs, and watch them line up to hand over money… all while thinking they’re part of an elite club.",1,1757414713.0,u_aristosourcing,0,1.0,False

And I'm scared. I wrote what you're reading almost immediately after what I'm telling you here, and it's a really strange and unnatural incident.

My dad got up to go to work, he went out into the yard before he left and I thought he had already left. He didn't lock the door of the house and then he came back inside and realized that the door had somehow locked itself. I heard noises and didn't understand what it was, because like I said before I thought he had already left and I even feared it was some kind of burglar.

So I went down the stairs and tried to figure out who was making those noises and then I looked out the door and saw my dad standing outside waiting for someone to open. So I opened it and I was confused because I didn't understand how he locked himself in and how he was still here and he even thought I locked him in on purpose, after all he just had to get something before he left for work, so before he left he asked me if I was the one who locked the door and I told him no, because it really wasn't me. Which is strange because how can the lock work on its own and do all the long rotation it needs to do and it doesn't make sense at all. So after he left I was sitting in the living room with a cup of coffee and I heard the noise again and then I noticed a toolbox, in the box there were all kinds of tools, and these were heavy tools like a drill, a hammer, and tools like that.
Then I noticed that the tools were just moving by themselves and one of them fell out of the box and I was just in complete shock. I didn't understand how what I saw made sense and also the case that the door locked itself and I say then this is the most serious thing there is, I think there are ghosts in my house, or something else supernatural. And I don't know what they want from me. I've only lived here for a year.

I need your thoughts and advice please - I've just today bought a Sage Bambino - it was an upgrade from our Aeropress which has been going for 10 years now. (First time using a machine). All this time we had the Wilfa Svart grinder...but I'm not sure if this grinder will grind fine enough for the Bambino (or any espresso machine).

Sage expert help weren't much help - they pretty much just said 'buy a new grinder'.

Has anyone used a Wilfa Svart on it's finest setting to make good coffee in a machine, ideally paired with a Sage Bambino? I realise there are a lot of variables here and I want to make sure I get everything else right before I spunk another £200 on a grinder.

If a new grinder is the way - my immediate thought was to get a Sage, but I read a few sniffy reviews on here. I don't really want to spend more than £150 if I can help it.

My ideal situation here is for someone to confirm that the Wilfa Svart can, with some adjustments, make decent coffee in the Bambino!

The coffee flows like water, not like honey, like the setup wizard said it should :(

Right now, the coffee tastes WAY better in the aeropress, which is not what I need after spending £300 on the Bambino!

I've been on Elvanse for maybe the total of a week. Some days I feel very ""on"", sometimes too ""on"", whilst others it feels like it is fading by noon or so despite taking it at 8 AM. I take it in AM and then having a Medikinet Instant Release 20 mg booster later in the evening. It is helping me, as I am also coming off a high dose of benzos given my previous work. I was not abusing them/addicted. I have tapered 65 per cent, doing well, no side effects. I am working with my doctor closely.

I know sleep, diet, etc factor into ADHD Meds. But yesterday I took my Elvanse 50 mg at 10 AM and felt wired all day, and today it's the opposite. We hope that as I continue to taper from my benzo, I will need less stimulants as my Elvanse is 50 mg, though in Spain the highest dose is 70 mg. But I think this would be too much for me, personally. I hope to learn mindfulness techniques/non-medication methodologies to help as well as I understand medication is not everything.

But moving around between Extended Release & Instant Release Medikinet, Concerta and now Elvanse, I like Instant Release Medikinet the most as I can control it. I just have to be careful with crashes as it wears off. I am not sure I want to stay on Elvanse given how strong it usually feels. But for right now, I need it to help me get basic tasks down as I was too sedated before + ADHD. 

Question: Do other folks experience the same? Do people find taking days off is a helper or a hindrance? I've done it a few times and notice no difference, except on off days I am more sluggish and feel less energy to get things done or do anything at all unless I drink a lot of coffee because I get too overwhelmed and procrastinate. 

Very much a catch 22, but happy the benzo taper has been going well. Day by day...",1,1757414593.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

1ncfc2p,https://store.steampowered.com/app/3005260/,Welcome to the Squares of Hell subreddit!,"**🟥 Squares of Hell**

Welcome to Hell. But forget Dante’s circles — here everything is square, mechanical, and absurdly stupid.  
You are entering the *Squares of Hell* — puzzle rooms where every level means one sinner, one demon, and bizarre machines that make no sense… but still somehow work.

👼 In the first square, you rescue a rock angel with dragonfly wings. Yes, he shreds guitar riffs and drops sarcastic hints when your brain burns out faster than the sinner’s cigarette.  
🚬 Sinner #1: he smoked so much he smoked out his whole family and the dog. Now he jumps forever at a giant cigarette he’ll never reach. Solve the puzzle, trick the demon — and let the poor guy take a puff. The smoke cloud opens the door to the next square.

🚗 Sinner #2: once a driver who drenched pedestrians with puddle water. Now he’s cursed to push a car uphill like Sisyphus, only to watch it roll back down. Your task — put the demon to sleep with caffeine and fix the car. Together, you’ll smash through to the next level.  
🔊 Sinner #3: a music freak who blasted his neighbors out of the neighborhood. Now he jumps on a giant speaker until he finds peace in a suspended bed. Use a mechanical hand to tuck him in… and crash the ceiling down to reveal the exit.

And so on — every level is more absurd, every sin more petty, and every punishment more ridiculous. Ride hellish carousels, control a six-legged robot booth, trap demons in machines, and blow entire levels to hell.

⚙ **Game Features:**

😈 Absurd sins with even more absurd punishments.  
🧩 Puzzles that make you think, laugh, and swear at the same time.  
🎸 A sarcastic rock angel as your guide through the squares of hell.  
🚬 Smoking, coffee, loud music, garbage bags, and hellish mechanics.  
🔥 A journey through hell’s squares: from cigarette smoke to lava bridges.

*Squares of Hell* is a puzzle game for those tired of righteous games about heaven, light, and virtue.  
Here, you help sinners indulge their petty vices, outsmart demons, and descend deeper into the inferno.

Welcome to the square-logic hell. Survivors aren’t the smartest — just the most cynical.",1,1757414122.0,SquaresOfHellGame,0,1.0,False

I'm planning the power system for my off-grid cabin and thinking about installing 800W solar panels, paired with a 5kWh lithium battery and a 3000W pure sine wave inverter. I did some math but honestly not sure if this'll cut it for my daily use. Would love your real-world advice!

Here's what I'll be running:

* **Lights**: LED stuff, total like 200W
* **Fridge**: Small energy-efficient one, says 200W
* **AC**: Portable unit, rated 400W (gonna need it like 8 hrs daily in summer)
* **Coffee maker**: 800W (30 mins tops)
* **Water pump**: About 300W
* **Heater**: 1000W
* **Charging stuff**: Phones/laptop, maybe 50W (couple hours)

Lowkey worried the AC and heater will just murder my battery... plus what about when it's cloudy for days?

Anyone running something similar?",5,1757413802.0,OffGridCabins,12,0.78,False
