1oyascq,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1oyascq/habits_of_my_narcissistic_mother/,Habits of my narcissistic mother,"Sharing incase it helps others, and partly as a journal for myself. For context, I'm 32F, and my dad, brother and I came to the consensus years ago that she's deeply narcissistic, but it affects me significantly more than anyone else as I'm her only daughter.

* **Competition** \- I am her competition, always have been. If family or family friends compliment me on my personality or give the slightest hint that they like talking to me more than her, I can feel her glare burning into me. Looks are a different story (see below), because if I look bad it makes her look bad and she's super vain.
* **Lying / no integrity** \- She'll straight up lie to make me look worse to others (I've overheard her more than once on the phone, for example, calling *me* ""manipulative"" to a friend). Her moral compass is weak - whatever's most self-serving goes.
* **Victimization** \- She'll also lie about me (and my dad, who's similar to me) to victimize herself to friends and family. My dad and I see through her more than anyone (my brother unfortunately is somewhat arrogant like her) and, since she hates that about us, she'll convince herself and her friends that we're problematic and make her life miserable. She generally *loves* being pitied.
* **Self-aggrandizing/bragging** \- Super blatant. She'll tell the same handful of stories about herself to anyone that will listen, over and over again for decades on end. How she had multiple guys fawning over her in her early 20s and the specific things they did for her to get her attention, that she was a lifestyle model for 1 year, etc., how she's a ""scientist"" because she worked got her degree in computer science (of course leaving out that she never spent a day of her working career in it)... the examples are endless. She has zero self-awareness that others just don't care/aren't impressed. Worst part is she'll say these things in the most cringey/obviously narcisisstic way (""I just cannot believe that guy did that for me! Like who does that, who goes *so* out of their way to show that much doting love and obsession for someone in their 20s..."").
* **Obsessive about looks/image** \- She'll permanently delete nostalgic family photos because she doesn't absolutely love how she looks in them, even if another family member has expressed they prize that photo (but will turn around and post any photo of you - even solo ones - publicly to her 3000+ network on social media even if you've expressed insecurity about it and asked her kindly not to). She enrolled me in a scam modeling 'school' at 10 years old lol. She started getting blonde highlights in my hair from when I was 7 years old, against my will, and then dying my hair fully light brown in middle school (I have black hair - both looked horrible on me). She can't live with herself if she doesn't always have her nails professionally painted/perfect, 2+ times per month, and she pours $$ (my dad's lol) into all kinds of skincare, treatments, etc.
* **Highly critical/insulting to me** \- Mostly looks related, but other things too. She frequently looks/behaves disgusted and has always reprimanded me for my 'asymmetrical smile', acne, severe psoriasis (as if I can control it), not wearing makeup, not getting my haircut how she tells me to, etc. She also won't hesitate to call me stupid or insult my character at any opportunity. She also calls me antisocial frequently (she thinks it's a bad look to not be super social, it's a status thing) and rags on me for my anxious/ocd/self-soothing habits (that I'm pretty confident I developed in large part because of her). 
* **Can't take criticism herself** \- Like well meaning, gentle, ""I'm sharing this because something you said kind of hurt me"" type stuff. She turns it back on you and immediately has a raging fury, and insults you like nothing else for daring to suggest that she's not perfect 24/7. Once my dad called her out (rather gently) for insisting on driving us home when she was mad drunk, he forced her to swap seats so he could drive us instead, and she was so insulted that when the car basically started failing us and we needed her iphone (Volt key/controller) to solve the issue and prevent a serious accident on the highway, she hid her phone under her seat out of any of our reach. Dad, brother and I got sent into panic/psychosis and talked at home bc we finally realized she's genuinely evil. 
* **Inhumane treatment as a child** \- I was spanked and yelled at any time I would remotely cry (like at 3 years old for example), or spill yogurt, or do anything else totally natural for a literal baby to do. Just got worse as I got older - emotion was never safe or welcome around her.
* **Man-hating + male-centering simultaneously** \- this one's confusing, but it boils down to which narrative is most convenient for her narcissism. She centers men in that she clearly wants their attn at every opportunity, party, etc. and wants them to like her more than other women. But she's also constantly blatantly bashing men - largely because anything that she's not must be inferior. Her race is better than others, her gender is, anything she is is best (but deep down she's insecure about all of those things). 
* **Entitlement/authority over others** \- Like cleaners and other service people around the house. Anyone who she pays for a service is her inferior. Unsurprisingly, she's spoken to cashiers and waitresses in rather yucky and expecting ways too. Telling people younger than her they should make sure they 'have kids before it's too late' (I'm pretty sure she regrets having kids haha she hates me, so this is just to make sure others are miserable too - she doesn't realize other people genuinely might like kids.)
* **Golddigging** \- Her and my dad frequently get in arguments because of her using insane amounts of his $ in ways he isn't even aware of, much less discussed with her. It's pretty obvious (but not to my dad) that she married him because he's a naive, hardworking, loyal, rather insecure (but not narcissistic) guy who will stay committed out of principle (and because he's the kind of guy to see the best in others even when there is none). He knows at this point she's messed up, but to this day he'll also make excuses for her frequently and delude himself into thinking she's well-intentioned where she's definitely not. My dad actually did seriously consider divorcing her (before they had me ha), which is crazy for someone like him - he's a commitment at all costs kind of guy. He never told her he was having those thoughts, but asked his parents for advice. They encouraged him to end it (also crazy, bc they're also traditionalistic) but he stayed despite that. I think it's because they already had a kid and he knew she'd villainize him/make his life miserable both to their friends/family and to his son.
* **Literally just inconsiderate** \- Her way or the highway. My dad can't have his coffee machine anywhere in the actual kitchen lol, but she can have and do whatever with the kitchen. Just in the flow of her daily life, no one else's feelings really enter the picture - she might break something of ours and not mention it, toss something in the fridge that's not hers without checking with others, etc.
* **Invasive and controlling** \- when I dated someone for the first time in my 20s, she caught wind of it and tracked all our call history (verizon family plan), got his phone number, looked up everything about him, and then read through our entire text history on my phone (naturally including *super* private stuff) when we met up for a vacation, and then harassed me about how I shouldn't be with him (without knowing him at all). One of those things where she has to be on top of my life to make sure I'm never too happy or something. 
* **Insane gaslighting** \- Off the rails. Pretending things never happened at all or that things were never said, legit making you think you're crazy and fully denying any and all of her wrongdoing. 

To no one's surprise, I'm exhausted and just don't want her in my life.",4,1763262312.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1oyanso,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oyanso/every_full_moon_my_roommates_eat_me_alive_its_my/,"Every full moon, my roommates eat me alive. It's my fault. Part 3.","Consciousness was *pain*.

I was moving, squashed against something warm.

Something... no, *someone*... writhing.

It took me a disorienting moment to realize I was in the trunk of someone's car. 

I wasn't alone. 

I could feel his ice-cold breath on my face, and when I dared open my eyes, I saw the eerie sliver of a crescent moon reflected in his iris. 

So bright, and yet so beautiful.

Rowan wasn't completely *done* yet. 

There were still pieces of him that were contorted, confusing static struggling to stitch his skin back together.

But he was awake, his half-lidded eyes piercing into me.

“Urgh. I fucking haaaate you.” 

His voice was a whispered slurry mumble, and I could sense the darkness seeping back into me, ready to tear me away once again. 

The two of us were pressed together, eye to eye, our arms bound behind our backs, so there was no way to avoid that uncomfortable conversation neither of us wanted to have. “You're drugged.” I whispered, testing out my new mouth. 

He responded with a spluttered laugh. 

“Ahhctually, for the first tiiiime in a while I am completely 100% soberrrr right now, so you're going to fuhhhcking *listen* to me.” 

Moving closer, I could hear his heavy breaths, his attempts at stifling a panic attack. 

Rowan Beck had suffered from them his whole life.  But I had to remind myself this wasn't him. 

Rowan’s voice broke apart, and for a moment, he blinked away that mesmerising light, and seemed maybe kind of human. 

“Nin.” He whispered. “I'm begging you.” His warm lips grazed my cheek. 

I don't think that was his choice, especially when the car we were in flew over a speed bump. “Please save them.”

Instead of speaking, I found myself running my hands through his hair.

Wait, wasn't I tied up? 

My head was spinning, two versions of Rowan swimming in front of me. 

“Do you remember that show when we were kids?” I was aware I was drawing out my words too much, but my tongue was swollen. “You know! The one with the, uhmmm…”

He laughed, and maybe it was him being not fully there, or maybe it was genuine. 

“Fuck *off*.” Rowan’s voice cracked into a snort. “I’m not a fish.”

I laughed too, the two of us suddenly in hysterics. 

Maybe we *were* drugged. 

I woke (for the second time) to *screaming.*

Both inside the room I was in, and further away. Faded, but still bleeding through the walls.

The cries closer to me, blowing my eardrums out, weren’t human.

It wasn’t just screaming. It was brutal. Animalistic. A banshee wail I felt in my brain and in my bones, numbing my body and freezing me in place as I woke from slumber. It took me a moment to gather my bearings, memories flooding back.

I was in the car with Rowan, and we…crashed. 

I remembered I’d died for the 28th time. I remembered Rowan’s body being copied right in front of me, static becoming flesh, and flesh becoming skin. The rest was a blur. I had a vague recollection of flashes, like my memories were being fast-forwarded. 

Once I knew I was fully real, that my body wasn’t made of static, I had tried to drag Rowan out of the road. 

Then a sharp pain hit the back of my head, the world spun around, and… darkness.

I came to expecting the hollow sensation and the hunger, but I just felt dizzy. 

I was lying face down on the floor in my bedroom back at the house in a fresh puddle of drool. I knew it was my room because I could smell the exotic plants I kept on my window, and the raspberry-scented perfume plugged into the outlet. 

Slowly, I sat up, resisting the urge to cover my ears to block out the cry. It was agonising, nothing I’d ever heard before. In the corner of my eye, I saw her, a shape bleeding into my vision. 

Somehow, I knew she was crying in pain. 

It was agony and fear and anger enveloped in one hysterical cry, burning her lungs out and setting her body on fire. 

Imogen. 

I could feel my housemate’s scream like a living entity crawling inside my brain. 

Like she was dying.

And somehow, I could feel it. 

The entity slicing into my soupy brain and twining itself around my spinal cord.

Like Rowan, she was sickly pale and gaunt, but somehow beautiful. 

Lying in a pool of halo-colored hair and moonlit eyes, my housemate writhed like she was possessed. 

But she didn’t look like a monster. She was in pain, each wail wracking her body.

She was like an animal, I thought. An animal who needed to be put down. An animal I couldn’t stand to see like that. 

Her vacant eyes didn’t fully find me until I shook her, and life began to return to her expression slowly before she sat up. 

Imogen was trembling, her eyes raw, filled with tears, and not quite human, but I could believe for a moment, if I suspended my disbelief, that she wasn’t a monster. 

My housemate stared at me, blinking rapidly, like I was a hallucination, before her hand whipped out, claw-like fingernails slicing into my flesh.

I felt her desperation, each nail digging into my skin and drawing blood. 

She could smell me. 

Rowan said that the three of them had been starving for the last few days and seeing me must have been agony.

Before she seemingly caught hold of herself, Imogen’s grip loosened, her clammy fingers detaching from my flesh.

My housemate’s expression crumpled, humanity blooming back into fruition. Her voice grew stronger. “Please!” 

She was growing progressively more hysterical. “You have to stop them! They’re hurting them!” 

Imogen tried to get up, but she was so weak. 

I found myself reaching out a hand and yanking her to unsteady feet, and once she could hold herself, my housemate dragged herself over to the door. She needed to eat, I thought dizzily. But it’s not like the snacks I hid under my bed would do anything. 

I knew exactly what Imogen needed. 

Once I was close enough to the door, I could hear it: low murmurs, followed by yelling. And judging from Imogen’s expression, I knew we weren’t alone.

There were people downstairs. Strangers. 

Remembering the figure looming over me, the person who had knocked me out and brought me home, I shivered. Who would do that? I thought. They had kidnapped me, and presumably Rowan too, and brought us home? 

“Stop who?” I managed to get out.

My housemate was sobbing, trying and failing to get the door open, her twitching fingers scraping the handle. 

I sucked in a breath and grabbed her hands, squeezing them. 

The same thing I did in our freshman year, and I found holding her hands and talking to her in hushed whispers calmed her down enough to talk. 

This time, however, my housemate was inconsolable. I did what I could to break through. “Imogen.” I spoke stiffly. “You need to tell me what’s going on, okay?”

I squeezed her hands tighter, and her wails turned into soft whimpers. I hadn’t forgotten what she was, and who I was to her, nothing but food. 

But right then, we were both dealing with an unsuspected mutual enemy. 

I shook her again when she let out a sharp cry. Her whole body was trembling, and I fought to stabilize her. 

Every erratic movement threatened to buckle her legs. 

""Imogen. Who's downstairs?""

Her expression darkened, and I caught that sliver of moonlight glinting around her iris. 

Somehow, my housemate was acting territorial. 

“There are strangers,” she said through her teeth. “They’re hurting us, and I can’t stand it, Nin. They’re hurting us… they won’t stop hurting us, and my head… my head feels like it’s on fire. I can’t... think straight….” 

She drifted off, grabbing the door handle with one hand, and my arm with the other. I didn’t fight against her strength. I didn’t hear the rest of what she said; it was caught up in a territorial hiss ripping from her throat.

Imogen’s grip tightened once again as my housemate dragged me down the hallway. 

She flattened us against the wall and twisted to me, pressing a shaky finger to her lips. *Follow me*, her eyes told me. 

I held my breath, sticking to her steady stride. “The guys,” I managed to get out. “Did they…”

What was I going to say?

Did they hurt someone? 

Kaz and Rowan were unpredictable under the full moon. I had no idea what they were capable of.

It must have been them downstairs, them doing the hurting. After all, in my head, they were monsters.

“No.” Imogen whimpered. “It’s a group of them.” She said, “They’re hurting us!”

Imogen’s humanity practically emitted from her like an aura. I saw fear, pain, and anger. All human emotions.

“Kaz and Rowan,” she said in sharp gasps. “They killed them. Over and over again, they keep killing them! And it hurts!""

Copying, I thought dizzily.

Someone, no doubt the person who had kidnapped Rowan and me, was torturing them.

Imogen swallowed a cry, her expression twisting. 

She didn’t finish that sentence, and that only left more questions as she pulled me further down the stairs. 

The low murmur of voices got louder, until I could hear them clearly. 

A man, or a group of them. As we neared the door, Immie grew stiff. 

“Stay with me.” my housemate breathed. She turned to me, her eyes glowing, that eerie white bleeding into her irises. 

I couldn’t trust her, not when her expression had melted into something inhuman, something I’d expect from a horror movie. Her teeth came out in a vicious growl, her steel grip tightening.

The monster my housemate was, however, was surprisingly protective. 

When I tried to pull my arm from hers, Imogen made a hissing sound, digging her fingernails in. When I caught sight of the front door, I had a chance to run. 

I had a chance to rip my arm from her grasp, lunge into a sprint, and not look back. 

But I didn’t. 

When I jumped from the last step, the downstairs hallway was quiet.

The intruders were in the lounge. 

I could sense them, and I knew she could too; her nostrils flared like a wild animal as she followed their scent, moving in quick strides. 

I followed, not as quick as her, my body leaning back, trying to escape.

“It’s a full moon,” Immie said under her breath. “Kaz and I had just enough time to protect the house before they came.”

“What?” I whispered. I’d already checked, and totality wasn’t expected until September 10th. I’d checked multiple times to ensure I’d have enough time to escape before a full moon fell on us. 

But even as I thought that, my eyes found the clumsily taped-up front door, and if I squinted, I could just about glimpse the tiniest fragment of moon peeking in. 

“They broke in,” she said. “Those bastards broke in and took Kaz and then hunted down you and Rowan.”

As she spoke, my housemate pulled me towards the lounge, where I knew the 
kidnappers were. 

Immie stiffened up when she reached the door. 

I think part of her enjoyed searching each room beforehand, like she was hunting them down. She reminded me of a lioness losing her cubs. Whoever hurt Kaz and Rowan was dead, and we both knew that. 

I could tell from the way she moved, squeezing my arm like I was some kind of anchor.

We found the boys inside the lounge, surrounded by a group of strangers. 

I didn’t know what to look at first. 

The windows were taped up, blocking out the night bleeding in, a protection from the moon. 

Scattered around the room were various versions of my housemates, copies of them strewn across the floor. 

If it had been my first time, I might have thought I was seeing things, or even in a dream of my own making. 

There was so much blur between fiction and reality.

Inside that room at that moment, that line had been crossed multiple times.

What I was seeing reminded me of an Adult Swim commercial. 

I can’t remember which one, but I do know that those commercials were made to spread unease and play with that so-called line which separated reality and our own dreams.

The copies were in varying states: decapitated heads and severed limbs leaking static mixed with blood soaking into the carpet. It was like seeing a cartoon leak into real life. The canny, with the uncanny. My stomach twisted at the sight before my gaze found the current versions. 

Rowan and Kaz were strapped back to back, duct tape covering their mouths, feral teeth slicing through the gags. 

They looked like fresh copies, but I knew from experience the pain clung on, and memories were still fresh, even before they faded. I knew they were fucking strong. Rowan had pinned me to my seat with one hand, and Immie’s grip on me was cutting off my blood circulation. 

But somehow, the restraints pinning their wrists to the chair’s armrests were enough to hold them down. 

Kaz’s gaze met mine, his expression crumpling, like he was ashamed. 

He rapidly shook his head, gesturing for me to run. 

Rowan tipped his head back, snarling through his gag. His eyes were already half drowned in moonlight, already half taken over. The two of them were nowhere near moonlight, with it being trapped behind the taped-up windows. 

But I still saw it coming to life in their eyes, in their cracking skin splintering apart, static moonlight leaking out. 

It was strange seeing the hunters become the hunted. 

Imogen didn’t speak.

Her eyes were wide, her expression feral

When she made a move toward the boys, an oldish-looking man stepped in front of her, and I recognized him from Sam’s group of friends. He was one of the people who had surrounded Sam’s coffee table, marking something on a piece of paper, and actively trying to hide when Poppy dragged me in.

Now that I was taking in the others, I realized they were all from Sam’s house.

I recognized a dark-haired teenage boy and an older woman with greying hair and a thinning smile wielding a knife that I knew had already killed the boys multiple times. The leader's eyes ignited. “See?” 

He turned to the others. “I knew the little bitch would come try save her boys.”

He grabbed Kaz’s hair, yanking the boy’s head back. Kaz glared at me, like *I* was the problem, before averting his gaze.

He didn't fight back, squeezing his eyes shut.

Rowan shoved him, muffle screaming, but Kaz didn't move. 

“We’ve been playing with your friends for a while now,” The man’s grin made me nauseous. He was talking to Imogen. “Now you’re deciding to come downstairs?”

I watched the group take their positions, following orders. A familiar sandy-colored ponytail sent my heart into my throat. 

I must have been seeing things, right? 

Sure, I was seeing some of Sam’s friends, but I wasn’t seeing my best friend himself. 

That idea quickly splintered when I glimpsed his face. 

I wanted to find his expression frozen in some kind of trance. 

I wanted to believe he was brainwashed or under some kind of control. 

But Sam’s eyes were lit up with excitement, anticipation, his lips pulling into a small smile as his group surrounded Rowan and Kaz.

He must have seen me with Imogen, must have known that I was in the room. 

As much as I struggled to meet his gaze, however, I realized he was actively ignoring me. Sam was armed. 

The boy who told me he was scared of fireworks going off was armed with a scary-looking blade sticking from his belt, a handgun moulded into his palm. 

Imogen, trembling, stepped in front of me. Her lips curled back into a hiss, and the man’s eyes widened.

“See. She's a monster.” The man cocked his head, and I tore my gaze from Sam. “A devil too, I presume.”

Devils. My eyes took in the rest of them, their disgusted sneers. That’s what these people thought they were.

Imogen winced, hurt by their words, but she held herself together.

“They’re not devils.” I heard myself say, surprised by my confidence. 

I had spent days trying to escape the monsters in my house, the monsters who were killing and eating me. 

Yet, I was still a resident, and Sam and his gang were the intruders.

“Get out.” I said, directing my words at Sam. I was going to kill him.

Then I was going to kill his friends. 

“This has nothing to do with you.” I sucked my teeth. “Also, they're *clearly* werewolves.”

Rowan caught my eye, his expression crumpling. 

Even with the duct tape gag, his eyes perfectly screamed, “Are you *serious*?”

“No, Nin.” Imogen murmured. “I want to know who the *fuck* they think they are.”

Imogen’s gaze snapped to the man, her lips curling into a snarl. “Why are you hurting my family?”

Her grip slipped from my arm, and I was free. I was free to run, but I didn’t. 

Immie’s eyes reminded me of a cornered animal. She was frantic. 

“Who *are* you?” 

It was the first time I’d heard Imogen Prairie sound threatening. 

I’d known her for two years, and I’d never seen this side of her.

The monster she had been trying to hide.

She opened her mouth to speak but stopped when the teenage boy, who looked to be thirteen at most, lunged forward, grabbed Rowan by the scruff of his neck, yanked his head back, and plunged the knife he’d been playing with into my housemate’s stomach.

Rowan screamed, an agonizing raw wail piercing my brain. But his cry wasn’t alone. Kaz, struggling wildly, howled into his gag—and Imogen squeaked, slamming a hand over her mouth. 

And then it hit me. Why I’d woken to her crying, writhing on my bed. 

Why her tangled words had been barely decipherable on her tongue.

“Stop!” She screamed, dropping all pretense. 

Imogen could feel them. 

Everything they felt, everything the two of them were going through, she felt it too, and it was ripping her apart. 

Every copy of the boys who had been tortured and murdered, Imogen felt everything. Their pain. 

Their deaths. 

Their rebirths. 

Chuckling, the man pulled the knife out with a whistle.

It slid easily back through several layers of skin, though the knife was wet with static. 

Imagine something you didn’t think was tangible, didn’t think could be touched, and there it was, slicking the blade. 

There was a cavern in his gut, and already the blood was draining away, the skin stitching back together with pooling static. The man’s eyes were wide, lips stretched into a grin. 

“This is a fascinating magic trick,” he leered. “Why don’t you tell me, huh? How do these guys do it? We can slice up your boys and cut off their heads, and they just grow another one!”

His shriek of laughter pierced my ears, and I caught Rowan’s half-lidded eyes flick to the window still covered with tape.

Imogen's lip curled. She was already keeping an eye on him. Something told me the chair wasn't going to hold him for long.

“Rowan.” she spat. “I'm *handling* it.”

He responded with a snort, muffling through the tape.

“Well, you're doing a *great* fucking job!”

“I’ve got a question.” The kid stepped forward with a scowl. I expected Imogen to attack him, but she just stood there, paralyzed, her body rattling with the boy’s pain. 

“What did you devils do to my brother?” 

His words stirred something in my mind. 

Is that what they had been doing? Before me, had they feasted on others?

Others who didn’t share my ability to come back.

No. 

Because they made it pretty clear all they *could* eat was me. 

The leader, who was more in awe than disgusted, laughed. “You're devil spawn hiding in  an innocent’s body! Why don’t we have another look at what’s inside, hmm?” 

To my surprise, he gestured to Sam. 

“The Delacroix devil is an old flame, right? He’s all yours, Samuel. And don’t show any mercy, kid.”

In two quick steps, he was in front of Kaz, slapping him across the face. I saw Imogen’s expression darken significantly. Rowan snarled like an animal.

The man raised his voice, addressing the rest of them. “Just like I told you—this thing isn’t Charlie Delacroix. It’s a mimic. This creature wearing the boy’s handsome smile is nothing more than a suit of flesh for a devil, and we’re putting him down.” 

He laughed. “And we’ll do it again, and again, and a-fucking-gain—until he stays dead.”

Every word was emphasised as he ducked in front of Kaz, spitting each one in his face. 

Sam straightened up. He caught my eye before quickly looking away. 

“Yes, sir.”

“And remember,” the man grunted. “They aren’t human. I don’t know what the fuck they are. They're demons. They don’t even have shadows! Look at them! They bleed darkness, and they're feasting on townspeople!""

Sam didn’t move for a moment before nodding and striding over to my housemate.

Kaz weakly lifted his head, and I caught a glance between them. It was so fast I barely saw it, but it was definitely there. 

Familiarity and hatred mixed together in a cocktail burning between the two of them.

Sam didn’t hesitate, stabbing the blade through Kaz’s hand, and just like clockwork, Rowan and Imogen reacted in sync, jolting, like they had been electrocuted. Sam didn’t stop. 

He plunged the knife again and again, each thrust more violent, more brutal, telling a story. 

When Kaz’s body arched back, and he lunged forward in his chair, screaming through the tape over his mouth, howling like a beast, Sam twisted the blade deeper until it perforated bone, which turned to static, rewriting itself back into existence. 

Kaz’s body didn't make *sense*. 

Rowan’s cries turned animalistic as he kicked and screamed, his razor-sharp teeth slicing through the tape. 

Sam. 

No matter how much he seemed to enjoy it, there was something else in his eyes. 

Something I think he was in denial of, which only motivated him further. 

He was upset. No, angry.

Fuming.

My housemate’s pained wails were in perfect harmony, and next to me, Imogen took a different stance. 

Her grip slipped from my wrist. “Go upstairs and lock yourself in your room,” she said through sharp breaths. 

“Just like every other full moon, and don't come out until dawn.”

“What?” I managed. “Are you serious? I know what’s going on,” I swallowed. “And I want to help.”

“Help?” Imogen’s tone dripped with something sour. “So, not run away?”

“What?”

""Run."" She turned to me, her eyes pleading. ""Promise me you’ll lock yourself up. I don’t want you to see this.""

I was already backing away. “What are you going to do?""

Imogen was in agony. I could see it in her face, every contortion in her expression matching the boys’.

She offered me a sheepish smile. ""Just…talk to them.""

When I risked a look at Kaz, while Sam dragged a knife down his face, static pouring out, he was shaking his head. 

Don’t. His eyes were on Immie, desperate, as he struggled under the restraints. 

He seemed to already know what she was going to do. Imogen tried one more time. 

“If you want to talk, we’ll talk,” she said. “I’ll tell you everything about what we are. Just let them go.” Her lips pricked into a smile. “That’s your warning. Let them go, or I'll show you.""

“Show us?” the man scoffed. I inwardly cringed as he dragged his nails down Rowan’s face. Rowan snapped at him like a wild animal. “You’re already showing us! You’re inhuman! Be thankful we’re merciful enough to put you down right here—and not string you up on the gallows where you belong.”

“Then I’m sorry,” Immie said softly.

“Imogen.” Kaz muffled through his gag. I was getting déjà vu from the last full moon. 

He rocked forward in the chair, almost tipping over. ""You’re going to make it worse!""

""*Let* her do it!"" Rowan howled when an older woman with thinning white hair plunged her dagger into his arm. He was seething, a hysterical laugh bubbling. ""These bastards really think they can *kill* us?""

“Don’t do what?” the teenage boy joined in, a delirious grin on his face, circling my housemates like a shark. “You’re weak!”

Rowan spluttered. “I'm sorry, shouldn't you be playing Fortnite?”

“Imogen. Please.” Kaz chewed through his gag. “What the fuck is doing this going to accomplish?”

His gaze snapped to me, and I saw it. Disgust. Disdain he was trying to hide. 

“Tell her, Nin.”

“We just want to talk,” Imogen spoke through a growl. Her patience was thinning. “Let them go, and like I said, we’ll talk.”

But that just got a laugh from the group in response. Sam, the only one who wasn’t laughing, paused mutilating Kaz’s face. 

I noticed he was slower with the knife, like he was reveling in watching the skin slice open and splinter, bleeding moonlight.

“Talk?!” a woman screeched. Her voice was like nails on a chalkboard. “The devils want to talk to us?! Devilish wolves don't talk!”

Rowan groaned. “Jesus fucking Christ, we're not wolves!”

She pointed a gun at Imogen. “Tell me, child,” she sneered. “Would you be able to come back from a bullet in the brain? If I blow your head off, will you grow another one like them? Should I test it out? How about severing each of your limbs, hm?”

I saw the exact moment Imogen Prairie gave up. She gave up begging, gave up trying to negotiate. 

Gave up being human.

She grasped my hand, entangling her fingers with mine. 

I would be lying if I said it wasn't comforting. 

“There’s a freezer inside Rowan’s closet,” Immie said under her breath. “I want you to ignore what’s in it and lock yourself in there.”

“But—” I choked on my response, and she hissed, cutting me off.

“Now!”

I found myself nodding, my brain subconsciously submitting to that light in her eyes that was so hard to look away from. 

“Right.”

I staggered into the wall. 

Immie was next to me one moment, and then she was at the window, half of her face already illuminated in a semi-circle of moonlight. 

At first, I thought she was going to try another tactic to free the boys, maybe from the back. She was fast, after all. Faster than I thought. But… no. 

Kaz turned to me with questioning eyes before twisting to Immie, muffling into the tape over his mouth.

“Imogen, don't!”

Immie didn’t waste time, standing on her tip-toes and clawing at the protection put in place to block out the full moon. And almost as if the moon herself had been waiting in anticipation outside, fighting to get in, she seeped into the room, milky white light filling every corner and hitting every surface. 

I remember turning to run.

Though something made me turn, something, maybe morbid curiosity, twisted my body around and forced me to watch. 

Watch as I finally realized why my friends were so afraid of the full moon. 

Why they forced me to stay in my room every night and blast music until my ears were ringing. 

It was almost like they were waiting for it. 

At least, Rowan was. I knew part of him didn’t care about the control she had over him or what she made him do.

He just wanted out of that fucking chair. 

I watched his frenzied gaze fix on Sam, who was carving the flesh from my housemate’s face, before his twitching eyes darted to every corner the light bounced from. And then he went slack.

His wrists writhed against the restraints—then his face did the same.

It drooped to one side.

His whole expression went blank.

Kaz followed, at first trying to bury his head in his lap, but it was too bright, too powerful, drowning him, flooding his eyes.

Their faces, drenched in her, were... hypnotizing.

Just like the night of Abigail Matheson’s party. They stopped struggling, their frightened eyes wide, lips twisted around the gags—before going slack.

With her so close, inside the room, she filled me too.

I heard her voice, her melodic singing filling their minds.

No. Our minds. 

She was affecting me too. 

I was aware I was moving—jerking, twitching—trying to find a way out.

But I couldn’t move. She was in my head, twining herself around my being. Filling me. Teasing me. My housemates' eyes reflected the same eerie glow.

Not just the subtle halo glint I was used to seeing.

This was blinding light—light that should have scorched their eyes out. And yet it didn’t. Instead, it became part of them, weaving inside of them, fully taking over. 

She hit every reflective surface like she was burrowing deeper, overwhelming us. 

I was staring at Rowan, my gaze glued to him, that light bleeding from him was almost beautiful–hypnotising. 

I felt it beckoning me forward, and only snapped out of it when cutting fangs pierced through his ductape gag, his mouth parting in a monstrous snarl,  inhuman screech sending me to my knees. 

While the moon found her home, leeching onto their minds, I heard only the low hum of her song bleeding into my skull, enrapturing me.

The humans reacted differently. They seemed more confused.

I watched Sam’s expression shift from morbid pleasure to horror as he pulled back with the knife, but my brain couldn’t process what was happening.

Time seemed to slow down, and suddenly, there was so much screaming.

What my mind failed to grasp was that Rowan had ripped himself from the restraints, stumbling like an animal, duct tape still hanging from the corner of his mouth, and pounced on the woman who had leered at him. There wasn’t even a struggle.

I saw those brand new teeth snap out in an animalistic bite—and her headless torso hit the ground. Just like that.

So fast.

But he didn’t stop there.

Once free and fully exposed to her light, still suffocating the room, my housemate dropped to his knees, tearing into her chest and ripping out squirming, glistening insides until she was nothing more than unrecognizable flesh pulsing under his weight.

I didn’t even see Kaz escape, but his chair was overturned, and there was so much… blood. So much red illuminated under the mesmerizing moonlight, drenching everything.

It glittered under dim light, entrails and severed limbs strewn across the carpet.

Kaz had been the chilled out one, the one against killing Sam and his gang.

But once the moon seeped inside him, my usually laid-back housemate crawled across the floor, tearing into anything resembling human flesh, bounding forwards on his hands and knees like a rabid dog. 

I watched him dive on the flailing teenage boy, gnawing into him.

Mushy pink matter clung between his teeth as he chewed through the boy’s skull, newly elongated fangs splintering shattered bone and brain.

Kaz’s movements were mindless, blindly grasping for anything alive in his path.

Imogen pounced on a screaming man, ripping out his spine with a single, brutal tug.

Then Rowan—still kneeling over the woman’s remains—coughed up an eyeball. Imogen snatched it from the ground and stuffed it into her mouth, the pulpy mass of red and white squelching between her too-sharp teeth.

That’s when I remembered how to breathe.

Movement behind me. Sam’s sharp, heavy breaths hit the back of my neck as he whispered, “Run.”

“Get out of here, Nin,” he hissed, slipping on entrails stuck to the soles of his shoes.

“Fucking run!”

Kaz, still ravaging the corpse of the leader, reacted to Sam’s movement. His neck snapped up, head cocking to the side. 

His eyes were vacant.

Sam stumbled back. He didn't look scared. I wouldn't say it was fear. It was pain. Agony. 

""Fuck."" He said in a sharp breath, his gaze on Kaz. Sam pressed himself against the wall, twisting his head to find an exit. 

""Kaz.”  He held out his hands. “Hey! Kaz, it's me!” 

My housemate’s face was transformed. No longer human, no longer the guy I knew, twisted into something resembling a zombie. 

His eyes were milky white, filled, drenched, overwhelmed with her. 

Every part of him was her, his splintered skin bleeding her, his claws digging into flesh and bone. There was nothing there. 

No ignition in his eyes, nothing to suggest he was a living, breathing human. 

Looking at Rowan, he had the same look, kneeling over the kid’s body, his hands cupping into the cavity in the gut and scooping out glistening gore. 

Imogen, moving from each body with incredible speed, like an animal, her toes primed, slick with pooling red. 

I was still standing there, staring, like a fucking idiot, when the three of them seemed to… change. 

No, that’s not the word. 

As if they operated as a three, they all suddenly got the same thought. 

Kaz stopped mindlessly chewing, a slew of chewed up red mush slipping down his chin. 

Rowan spat out the severed arm he’d been mauling, and Imogen lifted her head, and looked directly at me. 

The other two followed, like they shared a hivemind of some kind, a mind which no longer thought like a human, instead like a feral beast. I would much rather have been ignorant at that moment. I would have happily worn rose tinted glasses. 

Instead though, it began to dawn on me. Looking at what they were feeding on, they weren’t really eating it. Just chewing and spitting it out, or in Rowan’s case, mauling on it like a dog. 

When Imogen slowly got up on primed toes, nostrils flaring, moonlit eyes pinpointing on me, I remembered her words before she surrendered to the moon. *Go upstairs and lock yourself up.* 

And as the three of them began to slowly make their way towards me, like animals cornering prey, I found my gaze going to their so-called meals. None of which they had eaten. Another step. 

They were taking their time, revelling in my scent, moving as a group. 

I could sense their mutual agreement that they were going to share. 

When Rowan made a sound cross between a snarl and a snort, I twisted around and ran. The front door was close, but they already knew my thoughts before I did. They knew my destination before it was in my head. Kaz appeared in front of the door, Rowan and Imogen behind him. 

So, I dived upstairs. 

Again, though, they already knew.

They knew where I was heading. 

Their footsteps followed me, pounding up the stairs, forcing me to kick myself further into a frenzied sprint. 

Their breath tickled the back of my neck, and halfway up the stairs, a hand curled around my leg and yanked. 

I crumpled, losing my grip on the top stair, flailing, and kicking my attacker in the face. 

Kaz.

Faster than the others, a mindless determination glimmered in his eyes, he didn’t stop, didn’t falter, only falling, and getting back up again, crawling up the stairs on all fours. 

As if watching him, the moon seemed to follow, her light pouring from cracks in his face. His arms wrapped around my waist and pulled me halfway down the stairs, and I kicked blindly, only for his grip to loosen, letting me go.

Reaching the top, I followed Immie’s earlier words and threw myself into Rowan’s room, slamming the door behind me and throwing my weight into it. 

But they were already on the other side, hurling themselves into old wood. Fuck. 

Scanning my housemate’s room, I glimpsed his closet. 

They were going to get through. 

Their combined weight was overwhelming, sending me staggering. 

I left the door, lunging into the closet just as they broke through. 

Rowan was first, then Kaz and Imogen. 

When I saw Rowan’s teeth curl back, an animalistic hiss ripping into my ears. 

Rowan dropped onto his knees, rolling around in seeping, pooling moonlight. 

I made awkward eye contact with him, and his head inclined. 

He made a soft noise, and I bit back a hysterical laugh. 

*Yep. Definitely werewolves.*

The closet door was flimsy, barely even a door. 

But something was inside: a large white container my brain didn’t register as a freezer until I yanked it open, finding myself face-to-face with severed pieces of an earlier version of me. 

I didn’t have time to be disgusted. 

Slamming the closet doors shut, or at least trying to shut them as best as I could, I climbed into the freezer, burying myself in my own body parts, and closing the lid shut. 

Sucking in a breath, I waited for them to knock it over, or rip open the lid. Instead though, the three of them didn’t even come in the closet. They knew I was in there. I could hear them clawing at the wood, slamming their weight into it. 

But for some reason they never came in. When I was sure I was safe, I risked letting out a breath. 

And then I was too aware of where I was. What I was enveloped in. I reached out, cringing when I touched my own severed flesh. 

Rowan had cut me into pieces. Probably so I’d last longer. 

My stomach flipped over, and my mouth watered. I was going to throw up. I could feel it, a barf-like paste creeping up my throat. The closet door suddenly flew open, footsteps following. They were in. 

So close. I could hear their heavy pants. Instinctively, my fingers curled around what felt like a slimy piece my torso before something flashed in front of my eyes. A memory from that version of me.

The version they’d murdered and cut up, preserving me in Rowan’s freezer.

This had happened before, I thought dizzily. I’d seen my body’s memories in a sharp blur of colors I could barely focus on.

But this.. this was in clarity. 

Again, I saw everything through her eyes. Unlike the other memory, it was less like I was seeing it, more like I was reliving it. 

The graze of cool night air on my bare skin as I opened up our door to a figure on our doorstep.

*“Oh, hey!”* My own voice was a lot lighter and more energetic. I barely recognised myself. *“You’re…not the pizza guy.”*

“Nin!” Kaz yelled from upstairs. “Did they send extra? My wallet is in my car!”

“Tip them if they're hot!” Imogen shouted, her voice a very drunk slur. 

“It’s not the pizza guy!” I shouted back through a laugh.

It struck me, then, that I didn’t remember this.

This had been part of my blackouts. 

What had been ripped from my memories. 

I felt myself pull away from my body parts, my gut curling at the thought of finally knowing what happened that night. I had to know. 

Even when part of me cringed away, refusing to accept a certain part of myself, I needed to understand the events. 

So, ignoring my body’s insistence to let go, I dug my nails into my own severed flesh, willing myself to delve back into the memory when it started to blur out of focus.  A woman. She was maybe in her late fifties or early sixties with white hair growing grey at the ends. 

Her smile was friendly, and I instantly trusted it.

“Good evening! Would you mind helping me out?” 

I felt the dread building in my current self, as well as in my memory. 

In my memory, however, I ignored the alarm bells.

“Bolivia House, I presume.” The old woman’s smile widened, “It’s just like I remember it.”

Her eyes flicked from the door to me. “I am quite lost.”

“Yeah, of course!” I said, my voice sounded different. Tipsy. I think we were all drunk. “What do you need help with?”

Before the woman could answer, a voice spoke up, and I twisted around. Rowan was standing behind me, halfway through a bag of Cheetos. “Who’s at the door?” He said, through a mouthful of orange mush. 

“Nin, I said don’t talk to strangers.”

Rowan. Part of me splintered. I forgot what he looked like before my blackouts. 

Before he started wearing raybans to hide the effects. 

His eyes used to be warm. Friendly. 

They used to be pretty to look at, a deep shade of brown with flecks of ember like orange. Now I could barely see them anymore. 

They’re almost completely taken over whether he’s possessed or not.

I shoved him, shooting the woman an apologetic look. “It's literally an old woman.” I said through a gritted smile. “Do you want to come in?”

Rowan copied me, grinning through his teeth. “And *what* if she's a psycho murderer?”

The woman cleared her throat. She nodded to Rowan. “Do you and your girlfriend live alone?”

*”Girlfriend?!”* He squawked, choking on Cheeto dust, and I shoved him. Harder. 

Rowan hissed. “That hurt!”

“Go back upstairs. You're drunk and embarrassing yourself.”

“We’re housemates.” I corrected the woman. “There are two more of us!”

“Okay, but whyyyyy do you wanna know?” Rowan pressed his face against the door, attempting to act as *weird* as possible. 

I shoved him again and he fixed her with a not-quite smile, “Are you planning on moving in? We're not an AirB&B, y’know.”

“Goodness, no!” The woman said. “I was just curious! So, four of you, correct?”

Rowan folded his arms. “Why so many questions?” He stepped forward. “Can I question *you*?”

“Rowan.” I warned him. “I’m dealing with it."" 

The woman nodded along, seemingly grateful for me shutting him up. “Thank you.” She said, “Would I be able to come in?”",2,1763261944.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

So I had this idea on Thursday night... I like a few local spots and would love to find out before I head over, which is going be an absolute blast and which will be kinda shitty today.

Not bars, ski mountains.

Not restaurants, surf breaks.

Not coffee shops, beaches.

I threw down my first prompt to ChatGPT on Thursday around 10pm. ""help me build a web app that compares my favorite spots using real data to inform and help pick the best local spot for me to hit up today""...

Friday morning I took the output and shared the idea with Claude, ""take a look and tell me if this is concept would work, identify which data sources to capture, where i can get the data for free and build me a prompt i can share with Claude Code in terminal on my mac so it know exactly what to build"" 

Then I simply opened my terminal, typed in ""claude"" and pasted the prompt.

There was definitely some Iteration and tweaks. 

It started as an idea for 5 ski resorts in Vermont and once I figured out how it would work I just expanded the scope, 

Bought the domain this afternoon (Saturday). 

Free Cloudflare acount. 

Hetzner Server. 

Troubleshooting with Claude. 

No Github.

Troubleshooting - The Ai prompt that generates the write up for each spot kept writing about the surf conditions, thinking it was a ski resort. Also Air Temps were fluctuating due to Kalvins, Farenheit and Celsius units being mixed up - 17F water temp and 0F air temp in california at one point in time. The Ai write up for ski spots breaks when I fix teh surf spot write ups too.

Anyway... I'd love to hear any thoughts or suggestions or just any bugs that anybody sees too. Thanks!

1oyahtb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1oyahtb/what_is_the_best_smart_plugs_for_voice_control/,What is the best smart plugs for voice control?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been diving deep into home automation lately, and one thing that's made my life way easier is getting the right smart plugs for voice control. I wanted to share what I learned because honestly, not all smart plugs are created equal.

**Why Voice Control Matters**

Being able to tell Alexa or Google Assistant to turn off my coffee maker while I'm still in bed is honestly amazing. No more getting up to flip switches or fumbling with my phone. Voice activated plugs have basically made me feel like I'm living in the future, but without spending a fortune.

**What Makes a Smart Plug Actually Good?**

After trying different brands, here's what matters:

The connection needs to be solid. Nothing's more annoying than yelling at Alexa three times because your wifi smart plug keeps disconnecting.

Response time is huge too. When I say ""turn on the lamp,"" I don't want to wait five seconds wondering if it heard me.

App quality matters even though we're talking about voice control. You'll still need the app for initial setup and schedules.

**My Experience So Far**

I started with cheaper options from random brands on Amazon, and yeah, you get what you pay for. Some worked fine for a few weeks then just stopped responding to voice commands. Others had apps that looked like they were designed in 2010.

The intelligent plugs that actually work well usually come from established brands. They integrate better with Alexa, Google Home, and even Apple HomeKit. Setup takes like five minutes, and they just... work.

**What I'm Using Now**

I've been checking out different options on <a href=""https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs"">this page that compares the best smart plugs</a> for voice control. It breaks down the top-rated ones on Amazon with real user reviews, which helped me avoid the duds.

The ones I ended up getting have energy monitoring too, which is a cool bonus. I can see how much power my window AC unit actually uses and control it with voice commands from anywhere in my apartment.

**Things to Consider Before Buying**

Make sure whatever you get works with your voice assistant. Most support Alexa and Google, but double-check.

Think about outlet size. Some smart plugs are bulky and block both outlets. Get compact ones or look for multi-plug options.

2.4GHz WiFi is usually required. Most don't work with 5GHz networks, which caught me off guard at first.

**Bottom Line**

If you're looking to automate your home without rewiring everything, voice controlled smart plugs are honestly the easiest place to start. They're affordable, simple to install, and actually make daily life more convenient.

I'd recommend checking out <a href=""https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs"">the current deals on quality smart plugs here</a> before buying. Prices change a lot on Amazon, and you can compare features side by side.

His overarching policy is about strengthening America’s negotiating leverage, and selective adjustments prove he’s willing to be flexible where it directly helps consumers. Real wages will finally increase as Trump fixes the affordability mess left by failed policies. 

**Democratic narrative**: Trump's tariff reversal exposes years of lies about who actually pays these taxes — American consumers, not foreign countries, as repeatedly claimed. These tariffs artificially inflated grocery prices to fund billionaire tax cuts while ordinary families suffered at checkout. The policy flip proves tariffs were always a hidden tax on working Americans disguised as a strict trade policy.

I’m talking bushy tail, hissing,growling,SCREAMING the works he absolutely did NOT like her, but she loves him she wants to play and doesn’t seem to get that he wants her dead. We were able to get separate stuff today(overdraft is great) but I think the damage is done he won’t stop growling at my fiancé(not sure why) or the kitten.

1oyaeab,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1oyaeab/aio_for_thinking_my_girlfriend_is_kinda_toxic/,AIO for thinking my girlfriend is kinda toxic?,"This morning we had an apartment tour at 9:45. Around 8:30, my girlfriend suddenly said she had a “quick 10-minute” work task she had to do right now. I asked if it really needed to be done immediately since the deadline was Monday, and she insisted yes because she needed someone’s approval before then. It ended up taking about 30 minutes, so we didn’t get the coffee/food we’d planned.

As we left for the tour, she asked if I was upset. I said yes, because it felt like she could’ve done it later instead of making me wait. The first thing she brought up was how she wasn’t upset that one time I had to work on her birthday. (For context, that was a weekday, I actually had a same-day deadline, and we still made it to our dinner reservation on time.) That already felt like deflection.

After a bit of back and forth, she admitted she could have done the work later but didn’t want to procrastinate and be stressed all day. I said that felt dishonest, and she got upset at me for using the word “lie,” and things spiraled from there.

Later at home, I tried to talk calmly. I apologized for using the word lie since I know it’s loaded for her, but said it still felt like I wasn’t told the full truth. I also said the argument felt like “escalation after escalation,” and pointed out that when I told her I was upset, she immediately brought up my working on her birthday instead of hearing me out. She told me that the way I was describing things made it sound like I wanted an argument. She insisted she hadn’t escalated anything and that the only issue was me calling her a liar.

I brought up something similar from a few days earlier: during another argument she told me it felt like I don’t care about her or think about her, and later that night said she didn’t know or couldn’t remember the last time she felt cared about. Today she said she didn’t say that, then said she didn’t remember, and later said she remembers the conversation but didn’t “explicitly” say those exact words. When I asked if she believes me that she still said she couldn’t remember the last time she felt I cared about her, she said, “I believe that’s how you remember hearing it.”

That honestly messed with my head.

This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. Whenever I bring something up, she gets defensive, brings up unrelated things, or denies/minimizes what she said, and focuses on wording instead of the meaning. I end up feeling like the unreasonable one and questioning my own memory.

I haven’t spoken to her the rest of the day because I’m drained and honestly scared to bring anything up at this point.

1oyae0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobloxMyths/comments/1oyae0c/need_help_finding_an_old_myth_game_might_not_be/,Need help finding an old myth game (might not be idk),"So the other day, I was on a call with one of my long-time friends, and the topic of Roblox came up. We talked about the ""good old days"" when we'd play Roblox during lockdown, and she brought up various myth games we used to play. Keep in mind, we were no older than 12-14 at the time of lockdown (2019-2021), so my memory is kind of fuzzy with remembering what we played exactly, but being 18 now, I suggested we revisit some of those games we played to see if we would find more hidden meanings in certain games we originally thought were just ""creepy"" or ""weird"".

It started with the Double R Bar, where we'd watch people talk about politics and religion, and that was our first ""niche"" and ""edgy"" game. We made a few questionable friends, one of whom introduced us to more obscure myth games like Mind Murder Place, OneDayThingsChange, and a few others I also can't really remember T\_T.

The game I'm trying to find, though, I remember certain parts very distinctly, and I want to see if anyone can help me find it.

From what I remember (pls note that some of it might be wrong because I might mix up bits and pieces from other myth games), the main setting was in a hotel. There was a functioning elevator and certain items you could interact with that would give a caption, like pop-up text that probably alluded to a story that was within a game. The lobby had couches and a loft with a library. There were NPCs that would only give one or two sentence dialogues when interacted with, and I remember a middle-aged woman in the lounge area and a grandpa in the library. I specifically remember the loft having coffee tables and chairs placed by the railing, and that's where the grandpa was seated. I also remember an apple (for whatever reason, idk if it was interactable). The elevators would bring you to a different floor, and you could explore the hotel; I think the higher you got, the more anomalies you would find throughout the hotel, like a monster being in the pool room (of which I remember not being able to hurt you), and most rooms not being able to be used. I don't remember if there were entities that could attack you, but I'm guessing there weren't because my friend and I wouldn't play games where we'd die from something too often..

Other than that, I think certain objects would either connect you to different experiences linked to the main game or teleport you to a different part of the map. One room in particular was an optical illusion room with white and black checkered floors and walls. I think there was a big dip in it with a big ball having the same pattern.

The game had a rustic, antique look to it, and the graphics and attention to detail in the game were exceptionally good compared to other games, but still had a blocky feel to it, ykwim? Like, the NPCs looked half-rendered in a kinda situation, but otherwise it was really nice. You couldn't sprint, crouch, or go into any other F/POV.  
The topic has been on my mind for a week now, and it's lowkey been driving me nuts. It's a silly thing to think about, as I definitely have better things to be worrying about, but I just wanted to know if anyone else remembered or knew of this game.

1oyacbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaterFilters/comments/1oyacbb/ecofriendly_plumbing_solutions_cleaner_water_and/,Eco-Friendly Plumbing Solutions: Cleaner Water and Lower Waste Throughout Your Home,"Installing A whole house water filter is one of the most effective ways to improve water quality in your home. While many households focus only on drinking water filters, untreated water can impact every area of daily life, including showers, laundry, cooking, and appliances. By installing [A whole house water filter](https://www.purewater4life.com.au/wholehousefilters), you ensure that all taps in your home deliver clean, safe, and fresh water, improving comfort, health, and the longevity of plumbing systems and household appliances.

https://preview.redd.it/1hb04s328j1g1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f0ee20a7a81d8c14d06989f02b7f3648cae9f7c

Why Whole-Home Water Filtration is Essential

Water is an essential part of everyday life, yet untreated water often contains chlorine, sediment, rust, organic compounds, and chemicals that can affect:

•           Skin and hair health

•           Laundry appearance and longevity

•           Appliance performance and lifespan

•           Plumbing efficiency

•           Taste and quality of food and beverages

With A whole house water filter, water is treated at the point of entry, providing consistent quality across every tap. Unlike small filters that target only drinking water, a whole-home system protects your entire household.

Healthier, Gentler Showers

Chlorine and chemicals in unfiltered water can irritate skin, strip natural oils, and leave hair dry and brittle. Hot water can intensify these effects, making daily showers uncomfortable.

By installing A whole house water filter, you’ll notice:

•           Softer, gentler showers and baths

•           Reduced skin irritation and dryness

•           Healthier, more manageable hair

•           Chlorine-free water for a comfortable shower experience

•           Safe water for children and sensitive individuals 

Filtered water transforms your shower from a routine into a relaxing, nourishing experience.

Better Water for Cooking and Drinking

Even if a separate drinking water filter is used, cooking with untreated water can negatively impact taste, safety, and hygiene. Chlorine, chemicals, and sediment can alter the flavour and quality of meals.

A whole house water filter ensures:

•           Clean, fresh water for cooking and boiling

•           Chemical-free water for washing fruits and vegetables

•           Improved taste in tea, coffee, and other beverages

•           Safe, high-quality water for all culinary application 

Filtered water enhances every meal and drink, improving health and enjoyment for the entire family.

Softer, Brighter Laundry

Water quality has a direct effect on laundry. Chlorine and minerals in unfiltered water can fade colours, stiffen fabrics, and reduce detergent effectiveness. Hard water can also lead to scaling in washing machines over time.

With A whole house water filter, you’ll enjoy:

•           Softer, cleaner clothes

•           Brighter, longer-lasting fabrics

•           Reduced detergent usage

•           Extended washing machine lifespan

Filtered water ensures your clothes remain vibrant and fresh while protecting your appliances.

Protecting Appliances and Plumbing

Sediment, rust, and debris in water can accumulate in pipes and appliances, causing blockages, reduced efficiency, and costly repairs. Installing A whole house water filter prevents these issues, protecting your home’s infrastructure.

Filtered water safeguards:

•           Hot water systems and boilers

•           Washing machines and dishwashers

•           Coffee machines, kettles, and ice makers

•           Pipes, taps, and irrigation systems

This protection reduces maintenance costs, extends appliance life, and keeps your home running smoothly.

Suitable for Mains and Rainwater Systems

Australia has diverse water sources, including mains and rainwater tanks. A whole house water filter is engineered to handle both effectively.

For mains water:

•           Reduces chlorine, chemicals, and odours

•           Improves taste and clarity

•           Protects plumbing and appliances

For rainwater:

•           Removes sediment, debris, and organic matter

•           Improves water clarity and safety

•           Provides clean water for all household uses

Filtered water ensures consistent quality across all taps, regardless of the source.

Maintenance and Long-Term Benefits

Maintaining A whole house water filter is simple. Sediment filters typically require replacement every 3–6 months, carbon filters every 6–12 months, and specialty filters according to usage. Regular maintenance ensures optimal performance and longevity.

Key advantages include:

•           Clean, safe water at every tap

•           Softer showers and healthier hair and skin

•           Brighter, longer-lasting laundry

•           Reduced plumbing and appliance issues

•           Greater comfort, convenience, and efficiency in your home

Conclusion: A Valuable Investment for Every Home

Investing in A whole house water filter is one of the most practical upgrades you can make for your home. From softer showers and cleaner laundry to better-tasting water and protected appliances, the benefits are extensive. Every tap delivers fresh, clean, and safe water, creating a healthier, more comfortable, and enjoyable environment for your entire family.

[The episode starts of with a voice tell the viewers about a myth]

A Voice: Beware the Black cat. That myth has been spread down for many years. A black cat that spreads misfortune, pain and bad luck, to anyone that crosses its path. Beware the black cat, it’ll haunt you if you don't heed the warning. Beware the black cat. A single hair will curse you for all your days. 

That's what kids used to say. But of course as all myths there are never true, nobody actually believed this. But what if it was true? 
What if all the stories that others have been saying manifested into the actual curse for the black cat.
And what the cat knows is that it's cursed with bad luck, and doesn't know how to stop itself from causing pain.
It truly is a pity for anyone she tries to get close to. Oh Little black cat, Even though you can't hear me, hopefully you'll learn that life will always exist and life will always have a bit of calamity within itself.

Black cat: [Shocked from being grabbed so suddenly]

Jessie: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

[The Cat girl gets angry and looks like there about to attack]

Jessie: wait. [Jessie observes the Cat girl]
Dirty clothes, Unwashed hair, bad smell, oh this kid is a homeless stray and she looks so young... Wait just a moment kid [Jessie reaches something in her purse while still holding her]

[The Black cat not liking being touched, She looks like she's about to attack Jessie]

Jessie: [Pulls out the sandwich that Ollie made] Here, this is better than that dirty burger I can tell you that.

[The black cat a little shocked from the offer she takes the sandwich] 

[The Black cat takes a bite of the sandwich]

Jessie: Way better then the dirty sandwich am i right.

Pacifica: You're late Jessie.

Jessie: Yea by one minute. It's not like I missed anything important during that minutes

Pacifica: It always starts with being late by a minute. Next thing you know you’re late by 5 minutes, then an hour, By that time If they even show up there fired. 

Jessie: Why do you always have a problem with me? Out of everyone in this building that works here in Red Ink, I seem to have a special place in your heart that you tolerate.

Pacifica: I have no idea what you’re on about. 

[A worker comes into the building late]

Random worker: Sorry I'm late 

Pacifica: Huh? yea it's fine

Tom: Are you serious?

Jessie: [Cracks knuckles] Lord please give me the patience to not smack this bit-

Tom: I'M sure Jessie will improve her time management in the future. So don't fire her just yet

[Pacifica leaves and does her job at managing people poorly.]

Jessie: [Still pissed]

Tom: Don't let her get you down Jessie. 

Jessie: [Sighs] You're right let's just get the day started.

[As the day goes on Pacifica makes Jessie's day horrible by putting hot coffee on her table without a coaster, turning off Jessie's computer when she was working on a paper when she was almost finished. it didn't save]

[Finally near the end of the day Pacifica gave Jessie 400 documents that she need to fill out which wasnt a lot, but still fuck you Pacifica.]

[As Micheal walks thru the store he keeps hearing 2 sets of footsteps behind him]

[Micheal hearing footsteps he turns around and sees nobody behind him]

Micheal: huh, for a second I thought somebody was right behind me,

[Micheal continues walking down the aisle]

[Behind Micheal are 2 small foxes with dirty looking clothes and masks on them looking at Micheal]

Red Fox: [shakes nervously] 

Yellow fox: You almost got us caught you Idiot. Control your breathing. And watch how you step, that's how you're gonna alert them.

Red Fox: I'm sorry I've never stolen from someone before like you.

Yellow fox:  we gotta do this to survive, I'm getting tired of eating food from the garbage.. so go on [pushes Red Fox forward] go and steal their wallet.

Red Fox: Why does it have to be me? You’re usually the thief outta the 3 of us

Yellow fox: You gotta learn how to steal one day. This skill will be helpful in the future. Now go on and steal that man's wallet.

Red Fox: Okay okay, just give me a second.

[The Red Fox continues to follow Micheal around the store to attempt on stealing their wallet]

[The Red Fox eventually figures out what pocket Micheal’s wallet is in, Red Fox Gets on top of a shelf and reaches for Micheal’s wallet and steals it]

Red Fox: I did it, I cant believe that i really did it.

[Micheal turns around because he heard someone talking and sees Red Fox with his wallet]

Micheal: Hey That My Wallet!!

Red Fox: Eeh?? [a little shocked that he got caught]

Yellow fox: YOU DUMBIE, WHO STEALS SOMETHING AND CONGRATULATES THEMSELVES THAT THEY STOLE SOMETHING!?

Red Fox: [screams and proceeds to run] SORRY MISTER!!

Yellow fox: [currently running] If we get outta this unscathed we seriously have to talk about you’re “talking to yourself” problem!

Red Fox:[currently running] Im Sorry It's a Habit i can't get rid out!  {whimpers} 

[Both the foxes Get chased all over the store, after a while They lead Micheal to an aisle, and and when Micheal gets to the end of the aisle he trips upon an shopping cart passing by that appeared out of nowhere]

Micheal: {Gets up and groans, Looks left.. Looks right.. Micheal lost the foxes} Son of a bi-

Yellow fox: BIIIIIIGGG Money

Red Fox: [catches there breath]

[location outside the store]
[Time 9:15AM]

Yellow fox: You know what this means? No more eating out the trash for the time being. We can actually eat decent food for a while.

Red Fox: {pants} This was a terrible idea. we’re gonna get in trouble and when we do i hope your ready for what punishment she has in store for us.

Yellow fox: Oh please she not gonna find out about what we did.

Black cat: Hmm?

{The black cats presents scared both the foxs. Yellow fox hides the wallet within there tail.]

{Both foxes got scared straight}

Red Fox: Hiiii.. how is everything going for you?

Black cat: Great {Smiles} there was this lady that gave me a peanut butter sandwich. here
{Gives the sandwich to Red Fox} 

Red Fox:{they smile and there tail start swinging} 

Yellow fox: You actually had a good interaction with someone? seems unlikely 

Black cat: {stays Silence for a bit} You know maybe If I do interact with more people they could actually help me with you two being hungry constantly.

Yellow fox: I thought you hated people.

Black cat: Not all people are bad, but it's hard to find the good ones

Red fox: Well you made a friend and that friend gave us some food. [before Red Fox can take a bite a bird swoops the sandwich and flies away] HEY!?

[The bird landed on a part of the electric pole wire that was a bit ripped. and the bird got electrocuted. The bird being burned falls into the parking lot along with the sandwich]

Red fox: Hey The sandwich seems to be fine, in fact it might be better sense it's cooked.

[The bird and the sandwich slowly get run over by a car pulling out from the parking lot, The black cat puts their hands over their mouth in shock. The yellow fox covers their ears so they wouldn't hear the crunch from the bird’s bones, and the red Fox covers there eyes so they wouldn't see the death]

Red Fox: {turns to Yellow fox and black cat} How come whenever i have any happiness it gets stripped away in a matter of seconds. 
[Tears start to form]

Yellow fox: It's the mystery of life.

Black cat: uhhh.. I'll find something else for you to, just dont lose hope. [Bends down to wipe the tears off Red Fox]

Red Fox: what about you?

Emily: I'll be fine so don't worry [smiles and pets Red Fox and leaves]

Red Fox: But I am.

Yellow fox: It'll be alright. with this wallet. We’ll be providing the food for a while. Just imagine the look on her face when we come back to her with food

Red Fox: [Gasps] She'd be so happy. Wait Do you even have a plan of how we can fool Her into thinking we didn't steal any of said food?

Yellow fox: I'm so glad you asked my little servant. And the plan is What if we happen to “stubble upon the money together” she’ll think some poor fool lost there wallet. {smirks}

Jessie: What were you thinking? Buying a BB gun.

Milo: Bold of you to assume I was “thinking”

Jessie: [Angrily sighs] I Got bigger problems to worry about. Where is your father? He didn't come pick me up and I thought he forgot, so I had to take the bus, and I see that the car wasn't parked in the garages driveway.

Red Fox: I feel so bad don't you. 

Yellow fox: I feel great actually. Come on, the plan is still in motion.

[The foxes escape further into the city]

[Emily saw all this happen in the distance, they seem a bit mad]

Jessie: No, No, No. Ahhh How am I gonna explain this to the Manager? “Hey I got beat by 2 baby foxes and I lost the documents you handed me” uhh [Calms down and thinks] maybe just maybe I can ask her for forgiveness and ask her for more time. [She doubts] May God have mercy on me

[Jessie enter the Red Ink building]

Pacifica: is that an empty briefcase. Hmm Seems like you have since you don't have the 400 documents I requested.

Jessie: They got blown in the wind. If you can just give me more time

Pacifica: I gave you a reasonable amount of time and yet you still failed this task. Jessie, you used to be a great employee here at Red ink. But you're no longer in your prime. Maybe it's time to toss in the towel darling.

I'm confident in her abilities. just give her a second chance please.

Red Fox: yeah aren't you happy Emily?

Black cat [Emily]: Do you think I'm stupid?

Yellow fox: no? 

Black cat [Emily]: 500 dollars is an outrageous amount of money to just wind up in the garbage can. I saw and heard what you have done and frankly I'm disappointed. I told yall no stealing. And you disobeyed me.

[Both the foxes stay silent]

Black cat [Emily]: [Looks at the little foxes] now where is that wallet you stole.

[Both of the foxes have nervous and horrified faced expressions]

Jessie: those foxes got the Jump on me okay

Micheal: sounds like they took your pride as well.

Jessie: They took more than my pride, they took my job along with them.

Tom: Why are we sitting here at a table shouldn't we go back out there and find more documents?

Jessie: No point, Even with the 3 of us we only found 80 documents that just so happen to be in the city. It's over, I've lost my job.

[A moment of silence]

[Somebody comes inside the fast food restaurant, That somebody goes to the table Jessie is sitting at and hands them something, hands them the documents]

Jessie: What the?

Tom: these are the remaining documents 

Micheal: All 320 of them?

[Jessie looks at the person with handed the documents and sees that it's the Homeless cat girl she gave the sandwich two]

Jessie: It's you. [Says shockingly]

Micheal: You know this little girl?

Jessie: … When I was running to work I met this girl as she was rummaging around in a trash can, I gave her a peanut butter sandwich and she went on her merry way. I don't know why she felt the need to collect the each document though
[Takes the documents from Emily]

Emily: [Looks at both Micheal and Jessie] I-

[Emily hands Micheal his wallet]

Micheal: Is that my wallet? [Grabs it]

Emily: You lost your 500 dollars right? Don't worry they didn't spend anything. 

[Micheal Check his wallet to see if she's telling the truth, which she was.]

Emily: I've told them they shouldn't steal from others but I guess they didn't want to listen. What do you 2 have to say for yourselves  [Looks at Both the foxes]

Both foxes: We're sorry.

Red Fox: We've been on the street for so long. We haven't had good food in so long.

Yellow fox: We just wanted a taste of something good okay?

Emily: [Still mad but understands their feelings] I understand you're tired but you almost cost these people there home? You would have made them homeless as well? 
Do you really want that on your conscience?

Both foxes: No..

Jessie: Wait You 3 are all homeless? But you 3 look so young. Where are your parents?

[A moment of silence]

Red Fox: Well our parents gave up us for adoption. but nobody wanted us, and Emily.. 

Emily: … Gone. [Her eyes look so dead]

[Silence]

Emily: we've been homeless for a while now, it's just how it is.

[Micheal and Jessie look at each other]

Jessie: Tom can you take these documents and place them on the manager desk and tell her i have “Family matters to take care of”

Tom: “Family matters?” [Looks at Emily] Oh I understand. I’ll take care of it for you.

[Tom leaves to deliver the documents]

Micheal: [Looks at Red Fox] Hey you stole my wallet because you wanted a decent meal right?

Red Fox: [Scared] Yes..

Micheal: Well Let me treat you to one. [Pulls out money from the wallet]

[Both foxes' ears perk up and smile while Emily is a bit shocked. The foxes are given burgers and they start Devouring the food]

Jessie: I don't think they're chewing, I think they're just inhaling the food.

Yellow fox: [Starts choking]

Micheal: Slow down are you okay?

Yellow fox: [Nods]

[Emily looks at her burger and slides the plate towards Red Fox and yellow fox]

Yellow fox: Ahh.

[Yellow fox pushes the plate back toward Emily, angrily]

Yellow fox: You need to eat as well

Emily: Hmm I thought I told you I'm fine.
Besides you two seem to be enjoying that burger.

Red Fox: Exactly, We already have a burger. So you don't have to worry about feeding us.

[Emily remains quiet]

Jessie: you know, I have a feeling that the reason they stole our wallet wasn't just to feed themselves but to also feed you.

[Emily being a little shocked by her words she looked at the foxes]

Red Fox: you tell us not to worry and I'll worry for you Emily, but you do these things that only make me worry more. I haven't seen you eat a meal in so long.

Yellow fox: He's right it's been a while since we all ate a meal together. 

[Emily smiles at them and decides to pick up the burger and take a bite, her pupils began to dilate and got bigger]

Emily: Thank you 2 for caring so much. [Got a little Ketchup on her face and wipes it off]

Jessie: So what are your names

Emily: I'm Emily. The Red fox is Clover and the Yellow fox is Daisy. 

Jessie: And You must really care for them huh.

Emily: I do, they mean a lot to me. 

Jessie: it's not easy surviving in the city taking care of them is it?

If anyone has a really good general method nailed down please share in the comments. I know results will vary slightly based on what espresso I use but I do take into consideration the age based on each individual brew. For this instance, consider that I’m using very freshly roasted espresso (roasted 11/11, today is 11/15, waiting a couple more days for them to age before using).

1oyaa0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultKids/comments/1oyaa0k/i_blocked_my_parents_yesterday/,I blocked my parents yesterday.,"Hi, 33f. 
As the title says, it all happened yesterday and right now I just feel...drained. 

Ive kept my parents at arms length for most of my adult life, I knew our relationship wasn't normal but our whole family is conditioned to believe that family is everything and you cant turn your back on them. 

Its been...a rough 2 months for me. I just have a lot of personal things going on and have been stressed. I haven't talked to my parents about it because as I said earlier I try to keep things short and surface level to avoid conflict, guilt tripping, or possibly something I dont want others knowing to be suddenly floating around the whole fucking town. 

Yesterday I left work early because of a lot of BS happening at the company. I was stressed about it to the point of tears. I went and got coffee at my favorite shop and then had lunch with my partner. During lunch my mom texted me, ""Hi, Midknight. Love you!"" 

Tbh, I just really didnt feel like talking. I knew if I responded she would call and I'd be on the phone with her. I didn't want to talk about what was going on which would mean the conversation would be too short for her and she'd just complain that I never talk to her (she always guilt trips me for this). I ignored the message and continued my lunch. 

I got home and cleaned the house for a couple hours, then I started prepping dinner because we were having people over for a game night. I needed it, I wanted to be with friends and laugh. I'm peeling potatoes when she calls me. Ignoring the call after ignoring the text would just cause more shit so I answered. Convo as follows: 

Mom: hi, what are you doing?
Me: im just cooking dinner right now.
Mom: I texted you earlier 
Me: yeah I saw, i was really busy today
Mom: Oh...*click*

She hung up on me. 5 minutes later my dad shows up. I knew what was coming. I told our roommate to open the door. I had a witness, theres no going back on this, my partner was unfortunately still at work. I was on my own in terms of standing up for myself. 

My dad came in to berate me about not calling my mother. That she told him I was too busy to talk to her and he said I should never be too busy to talk to family. Screaming, spitting, pointing fingers. Typical. I tell him to get out of my house because I refuse to be spoken to like that in my own home. He tells me its not my house its [partner]'s house. So I reach for my phone. He accuses me of trying to call the police on him, I told him no, im calling [partner].

He gives me a look of disgust and asks what do you think he's going to do? I put the phone down and tell him to leave now. He starts trying to gas light me, telling me ""oh you guys had a real bad childhood didnt you? You went to disney and Arizona every year, what a tought fucking childhood. Your'e spoiled brats""

He then tells me I need to call my mother or else. Or else what oh father of mine? You going to hit me like you used to? Going to berate and belittle me? Why dont you go ahead and take my door off again. GET OUT, I scream it from the deepest pit in my soul. 

Call your mother because she gave birth to you, you owe us. No I dont because YOU made the choice to have me. Why is your choice hung over my head constantly? Birthing me is first fucking step for having a kid. 

As hes walking out the door he tells me ""I hope you dont have kids because they'd be fucking miserable with a mother like you. Youre incapable of love. Go fuck yourself"" 

Im incapable of love? Me? 
No love to you is submission. Love to you is staying quiet and doing what you're told. Love to you is never questioning authority and being punished if you do. You think I'm incapable of love because I'm not going to lay down and let you talk to me like this ever again.

I immediately started crying when he left. My roommate couldnt believe what he just heard. My partner was furious when he got home. I blocked them. I finally blocked them. I need strength for the months and years to come because I know they will be talking about their ungrateful, cowardly and hateful daughter. They'll send the other family members to guilt trip me. They might come back to my house considering we only live 10 min away. 

I feel so tired. I feel like my spirit has withered away. I dont know...I feel really hollow right now. And my dad's words telling me I'm incapable of love cuts a little too deep. My siblings are on my side, they all went through their own forms of abuse and they deal with our parents in their own way. I dont think anyone expected me, the ""good"" daughter, to be the first to cut it all off. 

Thanks for sticking around to read. 

Edit: after re-reading I should maybe add some context for why I blocked my mother too. This isn't the first time she's sent our dad after us. She used to tell him when we hurt her feelings, or disobeyed and would stand by and watch as my dad screamed at us and hit us. My mother has given my sister a black eye. She once grabbed me so hard as a child I bled from her nails digging into my skin. She is not innocent. 

My dad once threw my sisters phone at her when she was 16. It cut her cheek open right under her eye. My mom called me crying because she was worried her husband would go to jail if my sister talked. She wasnt worried about the fact that her daughter had to get stitches on her face because ""she needed to learn a lesson""",7,1763260800.0,EstrangedAdultKids,3,1.0,False

I’m 18 and I just went away to college in another state and I can’t seem to make any friends. I meet people and I’ve become so desperate for connection that I’ll invite people I talked to once for coffee in hopes of making a friend. I try so hard but no one invites me anywhere.

My year started out fine. Before school started, I was hanging out with these girls I met at orientation pretty consistently. Then I stopped getting invited and they continued to hang out. I was fine with it because I felt like maybe they just stopped inviting me because it was more convenient since they both live on campus and I don’t. Anyways, I started hanging with one of my roommates all the time. We would do everything together, but once she joined her sorority and got her big, she stopped acknowledging me. I text her and she would never respond. To make matters worse, no one at home seems to care about me. I really only had one best friend from back home and I tried to text her consistently because I wanted to stay close. I wanted to have weekly facetimes etc. like I saw everyone else doing, but she would take forever to respond: anywhere from 2-5 days, which was nothing like her. This was discouraging, so I gave up reaching out because I’m so so tired of begging for people to care about me. I met up with those girls from orientation again and I told them about my roommate and how I was struggling, so they planned another thing with me then they forgot about it. I’m constantly alone and have no one to do anything with. Last week, I went to a concert by myself because I couldn’t find anyone to go with me.

I feel like the more time I’m alone the less I recognize myself. Lately when I’ve been in my clubs I’ve felt like I don’t even have a personality anymore and I’m shyer than I’ve ever been before because I’m afraid of doing the wrong thing and people not liking me. They already don’t think I’m interesting now, so I’ve felt like I need to change myself.

I apologize for this being so scattered, but it kind of all culminated this week when I was looking for apartments and realized I have absolutely no one to lease with. I reached out to those girls from orientation and they already had a lease together. I completely understand that but it made me think back to how they just stopped inviting me and how angry I am with people being fine without my presence. I’m just so angry at people right now. All my life, I’ve always been the friend that has to beg to be included. I might care too much or be too sensitive, but I don’t think I’m asking too much for just one person to value me. I’m tired of this world and how no one gives a damn about me. I’m lost and I don’t see a way out. I’m heartbroken by how I’ve been treated by my friends my whole life and I don’t see it ever changing. ",2,1763260659.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

Hi! About what I’m looking for: 

- M 27-35

- To prevent cultural clashes, I am strictly looking for East / Southeast Asian men. Sorry. 

- doesn’t smoke, or at least not regularly 

- someone who lives either within the city or willing to travel as I can’t travel as easily myself

- must be ok with large dogs. I have a 60-pound American Bully (which is why I can’t travel as easily)

- a chill friendship-first connection that will hopefully eventually lead to a stable long term relationship. I’m not itching to get married or anything and super down to just be friends if we ended up not clicking in a romantic way. 

About me:

- immigrant from Southeast Asia

- pretty tall at 5’ 7”. I don’t care about your height, but you might care about mine. Yes, I do wear heels occasionally.

- I don’t drink :( sorry! I don’t mind if you do, though

- mostly a homebody with couch potato vibes at my core, but with an adventurous streak that comes out some weekends and longer holidays :) let’s explore and travel and try new things! 

- an OG weeb! Talk anime to me ✨

- fake gamer. Watches lots of YouTube playthroughs without actually ever playing the games 😬 but still, talk gaming to me! 

- I also love movies, coffee, nature trails, trashy reality TV, trying new food, J-Pop (I sing!), and literature :) I used to read real books, but I mostly stick with children’s picture books now 😅 for work. Oh, and I used to shoot arrows!

When we first met, I wasn’t working either because I was in a really bad place mentally and literally couldn’t get out of bed for months. But I’ve been working for a while now and getting back on my feet.

Meanwhile, I’m paying for basically everything. I buy his basic stuff like shampoo and deodorant, I pay for our dog, and if he wants something and I say no he gets upset and then asks his parents instead. For example: morning coffee. 

He sleeps in all the time, plays video games all day, and I have to wake him up over and over every morning (I’m saying at least 10 times.) He still has my card on his Xbox even though I’ve told him to remove it, and they keep charging my account every month.

He doesn’t have a car either, so he uses mine. I cover gas, insurance, everything. He told me the other day that he “filled up my tank,” and he acted like he did something huge. When I checked, he barely put anything in. I hate to sound greedy, It’s not about the gas, it just feels like he wants credit for doing the bare minimum while I’m carrying everything else.

I love him, but I’m so drained. I feel like I’m taking care of someone who refuses to take care of himself. I don’t even know how to bring this up without it turning into a fight. Has anyone been through something like this? What did you do?

The most recent review on Google complimented the staff’s kindness and creativity, something the owner and returning manager clearly don’t value.

They posted on their social media they’re closed for barista training.

*The ER was a desert that night—wide, humming, fluorescent, and utterly devoid of humanity. A rare and dangerous calm. The nurses lurked at their stations like gunfighters between saloon brawls, sipping stale coffee and pretending not to enjoy the silence. Even the monitor alarms seemed to have taken the night off, leaving behind a low electrical buzz that passed for peace in this madhouse.

I sat at the physician desk, twirling a pen like a man who didn’t trust the universe. Because you can never trust the universe. Not in emergency medicine. The very moment you start to savor the stillness—that is when the gods of chaos notice you.

And I was savoring it. Oh, hell yes. My charting was done, the board was empty, and the whole department was mine, a fluorescent cathedral lit for a single parishioner. I leaned back, cracked my neck, felt the rare high of knowing I hadn’t yet been asked to shove a tube into someone’s throat or divine the cause of their abdominal mysticism.

But the clock ticked like a warning. Any second, the doors could burst open with a bleeding drunk, a cardiac time-bomb, or a family of seven all struck by the same mysterious plague. In the ER, tranquility is never the mood—only the setup. The punchline always arrives by ambulance.

So I sat there in the eerie quiet, basking in the moment like a condemned man enjoying his last cigarette, fully aware that somewhere out there, trouble was revving its engine and checking the address.

It would find us. It always does. But until then, the silence was golden, the coffee lukewarm, and for one fleeting, treacherous moment, the ER felt almost human.*",0,1763260173.0,emergencymedicine,8,0.5,False

We came here for 3 weeks to discover a bit of the country and see if we'd like to move here next year.

We both work remotely (entrepreneur and freelancer) and would be coming under DTV visas around Summer 2026.

I've personally been living in different countries (Spain, USA, Madagascar, Belgium, Germany, Kyrgyzstan), and I speak 5-6 languages, and I'm committed to learning Thai, just like I learned the languages everywhere I went and lived, knowing that it will be hard but I have a track of record of living somewhere and learning the language (even Russian, which was the hardest).

We're not into shopping, luxury, or crazy nightlife. We're into: 

* Nature and Parks (and we love seeing green in the streets).
* Specialty coffee - the nerdiest part of third-wave coffee. Already met a few baristas to geek out with in Terroir recently. Looking to expand on that and make connections in the coffee industry.
* Playing ultimate frisbee and going to the gym. I've seen the soidawgz ultimate frisbee team and I'll find some community there.
* Building local community, creating cool projects to bring people together.
* Playing board games.
* Plants and reading.
* Shopping in day ""farmers markets"" for plant-based food, as we're both vegan and like to cook. We really enjoy markets.
* Creating and launching projects and doing cool shit.

Here's a list of things we're looking for in Bangkok, and would love your tips and pointers:

1. A neighborhood/area to live with a vibrant community with a strong social fabric, who generally stick around, vs a neighborhood of short-term stays (a few months) where people come and go all the time. We still don't know where we'd like to live and are likely to rent a few Airbnb's for a month/two when we come to discover different areas.
   1. Ideally, also neighborhoods where we can access a lot of things by walking. Since we walk remotely and don't commute, we'd love to be able to come to a market, a gym, and some nice cafés within ""walking distance"".
2. Clubs, groups, or organizations doing anything related to what we posted that we like above.
3. Tips from people who've established a nice community for themselves in Bangkok.
4. Any other things you think we should know that we potentially missed in our research.

  
As for our budget, we're looking at around 24-30k baht for a 2-bedroom apartment (so we can set up an office).

But I have noticed in recent years, many more Korean guys can grow nice facial hair compared to past years.

  
Even up to my last twenties, I could only muster a few hairs and whiskers in my chin area and below the nose area. Most other Korean American guys could at least grow a goatee.

  
What changed for me was trying to gain muscle mass and the journey through that process. In my late twenties, I was very slim and my height was height (5'10""). No matter what I ate, I could not gain muscles.  Even after taking in lots of protein, my muscle growth plateaued.  I did a lot of research and read books and the insight that allowed me to gain muscle was the knowledge of alkaline forming foods and acid forming foods.

  
In most modern diets (processed foods), the diet is very acid forming.  And because of this, our PH of our body is higher than normal. This prevents optimal nutrient absorption.

Once I was able to control and adjust for this, I started gaining muscles and at last my facial hair came in.  And I didn't even eat much protein (just a serving a day). It took about two years for me to get a nice beard. It was a surprise because I thought it was purely genetics.   
I also grew like half inch after this and my skin became very clear. My guess is that my spinal discs became more hydrated and the alkaline blood helped all the toxins clear out.



I won't go over every detail of whats acid forming or not, there are many books and online websites on this topic. I will give a basic overview here:

1. Processed foods are generally more acid forming than fresh foods
2. Fresh vegetables and fruits are generally alkaline forming
3. Lemon (despite being acidic) is very alkaline forming. That is why fresh lemon juice is used as an internal cleanser 
4. Some fruits can be acid forming like blueberries, but despite that, you should still eat them several times a week because they have lots of other health benefits
5. Vinegar and most forms of dressing (mustard, Ketchup) are very acid forming
6. Coffee is acid forming
7. Most Grains are acid forming
8. Meats are acid forming when combined with starches. But if just eaten with vegetables, they are some where in the middle. Shell fish is always acid forming regardless.
9. Fermented vegetables, especially things like 김치 and 깍두기 and all the other assortments of fermented Korean side dishes are acid forming. But there are benefits to these because they have pro-biotics and such.  된장찌개 has lots of vitamin K2 that are needed for your body. 



Aside from foods, what else acidifies your body:

1. Anger and extreme emotional distress. Learn to manage your relationships.
2. Exercise in immediate term because of lactic acid generation, but obviously you should exercise since it will improve oxygenation of the blood and help your body rid of acid in the long run.

What alkalizes your body:

1. Exercise in the long term, since your body get better circulation and breathing to remove all that acid.
2. Deep breathing. The removal of Co2 removes the acids from your body
3. Deep Meditation. 
4. Drinking lots of clean water will de-acidify your body when you urinate the acid out.
5. Fresh air, Sunlight, Earthing and negative ions. I'm not a chemist but if someone can explain why people say this work and it does from my experience, that would be great. Acids are electron receiver while Bases are electron donors?
6. Alkaline water machines - These were the rage in the 2000s to 2010s in Japan and in Korea. Many of these machines are actually made by Korean companies.  But these are expensive and while they can be helpful, they can also do too much alkalinity. Too much alkalinity is worse than too much acidity. I think drinking 1 cup daily of alkaline water from these machines can be good for Korean parents who refuse to change their diet away from all those Korean side dishes. Be careful here, the alkaline water will make medication far more absorbent and if your parents are taking any medication, they will have to reduce the amount.
7. Baking powder (Sodium Bicarbonate) - a pinch with large glass of water can give immediate relief to an acid body.  

Ask me anything. I will update.

Those cats passed away in 2020 and 2022, and I haven’t had a cat since. My friend needed to rehome her four year old former feral cat, and I felt finally ready to take on a new buddy, so I brought him home yesterday evening.
He was relatively fine when we came home, rubbing up against things and just wandering around, exploring. Every once in a while he seemed a little timid, but I was surprised at how well he was taking it. He even hung out with us on our bed. He did hide a little bit yesterday evening when my boyfriend left for some food and came back, but came back out a few hours later. Last night he was running around, he is VERY food motivated and a bit crafty, so he even woke us up after finding and ripping open his treat bag (which has since been better secured). 
This morning he was fine too, we spent the morning in bed with him hanging out at the foot of our bed. We gave him a silvervine stick and he even played a bit. My boyfriend left to go to get coffee, the cat got up to pee in the litter box… and right when he finished is when my boyfriend came home. The cat ran to hide and has been hiding with little exception ever since. We left for about an hour to run a quick errand, and when we came back he was still hiding. He came out to eat after a bit, ate VERY well, hung out for a minute… and then took off to hide again. Right now he’s wedged behind the couch, his head tucked away from us like he’s terrified. I’m starting to suspect there’s a pattern, because after he ate my boyfriend left once again to take the trash out and when he opened the door again, that’s when he went to hide. He would probably come out if I offered him more food, but of course I don’t want to overfeed him. 
I expected him to be timid and maybe hide for a while but the hot-and-cold thing is throwing me off. I admittedly have a lot of anxiety and am maybe being a little irrational. When my last cat died it was very sudden and traumatic for me and I’m worried something’s wrong. Maybe I wasn’t exactly ready for this, but that’s my problem, not his. I’m trying my best to leave him alone, but I do check on him once every hour or so. We have his first vet appointment scheduled for the 19th (I honestly don’t know the last time he was at the vet). I just want to be sure that this is normal and I’m doing alright by him. Is there anything I should be doing- or stop doing- to make him more comfortable? ",1,1763259445.0,CatAdvice,4,1.0,False

1oy9qjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXPreppers/comments/1oy9qjs/using_prepswhat_worked_and_what_didnt/,Using preps-what worked and what didn’t,"In another post someone asked me to kind of debrief what worked and what didn’t for us when we recently actively used our preps for an emergency. 

For context, we are an essential employee family and along with weather related events, a lapse in payday(s) due to a shutdown is the most likely scenario/reason we stay prepped. We had a feeling this may happen and spent some time and money in the month or so leading up to the deadline making sure we were mostly well stocked in our pantry. We do have a small savings cushion, which is something we prioritized after the 2018-19 shutdown. I’ll be talking about the time period from 9/30 to 11/14. 

What worked:
1. We paid every single bill we could with our last 2 paydays (9/30 and 10/14) even if it wasn’t due until later in the month. We put all non essential spending into our high yield account immediately so it could start accruing some interest, and hoped we wouldn’t need it. (We wound up needing it, and a little bit out of savings. ) 
2. We stopped ALL non essential spending. However, we allowed for a couple of real life expenditures. One was an event for my daughter’s extra curricular at school that had to be signed up for in a small time window. Another was letting ourselves order pizza one time, just as a little morale boost.

3. I used up quite a bit in our pantry. (But, see below) I  made a list of “eat first” for the first 20 days to discourage food waste. Today, we replenished what we’d used up since I already had a grocery list of things we ran out of. 

4. We encouraged our teen to have good attitudes about it, and it helped our sense of camaraderie. Some days really sucked! Having a sense of humor about it was helpful. 

5. We got partial backpay yesterday. We IMMEDIATELY paid our savings back. We also re-evaluated our budget because it was kind of eye opening how much we’d been spending frivolously. 😳

What didn’t work: 

1. Eating exclusively from our pantry. We decreased our grocery bill by at least 50%, maybe 60%. We COULD have, but we decided to shop sales etc as mentioned above so that we wouldn’t be totally bare bones at the end. We could have done a better job at this. 

2. Small cans of canned fruit/no shelf stable coffee creamer: Going forward, I’ll buy the big can of canned fruit. The small cans are like 1.5 servings each. I’ll also be buying shelf stable creamer so we won’t have to buy it in an active situation. 

3. Lack of lunch variety at the end: We got really tired of PB&Js or leftovers for weekday lunch. No one LOVES lunch meat enough for it to be a justified grocery expense in an emergent. I need to brainstorm this one. (Weekends were often Mac and cheese/ramen)


Overall, I think we did well. It was stressful but having a plan to endure it made it a little better.

The 2-5% or whatever the percentage works out to be was a daily espresso or two and occasional alcohol in the form of scotch 1-2 times per week, along with very occasional dairy in the form of butter and even less commonly, cheese. I had periods of being strict but then would get sucked back into the coffee and alcohol trap with international travels and vacations with my wife who loves to wine and dine. But finally I went super strict and hitting 3 weeks today. And the interesting note is I'm having subtle - not overwhelming - cravings for a lot of fermented stuff like blue cheese, beer, wine, mustard with vinegar, kombucha, chocolate, etc. I'm taking this as a sign of die off and chatGPT says it could take 12 weeks for very long-term SIBO to really clear. 

The message that I want to impart is: if you have chronic gut issues that aren't resolving, don't be an idiot like I was, just go strict for 30 days like everyone says. It's not that bad. I definitely plan to continue further to fully heal, finally.

Hopefully I'll have even more positive news to report soon in terms of relief of terrible chronic pain, indigestion and PTSD stress.

1oy9m1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1oy9m1e/egypt_can_be_awesome_tips_from_a_swissegyptian/,Egypt can be awesome! Tips from a Swiss-Egyptian,"I just went through a recent post about someone who had a terrible 3 weeks in Egypt, and that feeling seems to be shared by many (aka a ton) of people here - post got closed with over 800 comments in just a few hours. 

  
I‘m half Swiss and half Egyptian. I have never lived in Egypt but have been going there every year and feel like I might have a good perspective and advice for prospective travelers (I don’t speak Arabic and I don’t identify much with the culture, which is probably the case for most readers). Here we go:

  
1. Get a “guide”. I.e pay someone who acts as a buffer between you and whoever you may come across. They don’t need to be full of knowledge. What is essential is for them to not have competing incentives - meaning you pay them to help you navigate Egypt and its touristic layer. You just need to find a trustworthy person (plenty of them) and avoid getting a scammer disguised as a guide (bunch of these too…). Also works if you’ve got an Egyptian friend you can travel with. Just don’t do it on your own. I’ve been to 60+ countries, and that advice applies specifically for Egypt. 

  
2a. Egyptians are very kind, caring, and friendly (as are many people in many countries). They are funny too! Most of them live a pretty tough life with worsening economic conditions and little prospects of improvement, yet have this amazing ability to make fun of their own predicament. 

  
2b. Most Egyptians who live off tourism will try to optimize for how much money they can get out of you. They were born into it, and you won’t enjoy them very much. The reason why you hear so many horror stories is because most travelers essentially only interact with that (in reality small) sub-group of Egyptians, which I understand feels like that’s ALL Egyptians from your perspective. Whenever in Egypt I’m usually with my Egyptian family and thus don’t interact with them, including when traveling inside the country. This year though, I travelled with my partner‘s family (from Europe) from Aswan to Luxor and saw how wild it can become when you’re a tourist left to your own device. Back to my point 1: get a (trusted) guide/buffer person. 

  
3. Ideally: figure out a way to interact with non-tourism Egyptians. IMO it’ll add such a great depth to your trip. My father is from a countryside town in the Nile delta 60-90min from Cairo (depending on where you start in Cairo…). The prices have nothing to do with Cairo/Luxor/Red Sea, and the behaviours too! For example: a tuktuk ride anywhere inside the town (which is probably 100K inhabitants) for example is 25EGP/0.5US$ (November 2025). Experience made, even as a complete tourist they’ll expect you to pay the 25EGP and if you give them 30EGP and cannot speak a single word of arabic, they’ll simply return you a crisp (or not so crisp) bill of 5EGP - no questions asked. I’m sure those who travelled in touristic-Egypt and are reading this will think how unreal it seems - yes, that Egypt exists too. And that applies to everything inside that town (and by extension to all the non-touristic towns and cities): they simply don’t function for or by tourism, and thus have no reason or even the idea to take advantage of anyone. Whenever I have the chance to bring European friends or family to Egypt, we usually have lunch with some members of my Egyptian family there and then go for a coffee/tee at a local cafe with one of my cousins and whichever of his friends are around and just talk about life for them, life for us, life in general. Most of my visiting friends/family have referred back to that day in the countryside as a highlight of their trip, because of the immense contrast with the tourism-interactions they’ve had during the rest of the trip.  

  
4. If you can cover point 1, Egypt can still deliver completely amazing sights and experiences. As an example if you visit the temples and tombs from Aswan to Luxor (and if you don’t have enough time, just Luxor itself is already incredible), the stuff you get to see is IMO a multiple times more “wow” than say temples in Greece. If you’re into history / can appreciate stuff that’s been around for THOUSANDS of years, it’s Disneyworld. With the right guide/buffer, Egypt is also one of these countries where you can organise pretty much whatever you want from one day to the next without breaking the bank. You realize at 11.00pm that there’s a church in the outskirts of Cairo that seems interesting to check out: 15 minutes and two WhatsApp messages later you’ve got a private van setup for 8.00am the next morning. It sits on the complete opposite side of the spectrum from Switzerland ha!

  
5. Pick your season. It’s easier to deal with the intensity of your surrounding in 25-30C, than in 40. So, I don’t particularly recommend going to Egypt in June-September (unless you’re going to the Mediterranean coast in the North, which is yet another complete secret zone for most tourists with the finest sand and 30 degree crystal clear water).

6. Assume you’ll need to tip a bit for everything and anything. It’s a bit annoying for those of us who come from non-tipping culture, but it’s also not a lot of money altogether. The way I see it is assume that for example as a couple/family you’ll tip 5$ per day or so. Just have a tip-pocket with bills ready to go and just make it slowly rain throughout the day/trip. Don’t let it become this “I’m bleeding money left and right” feeling in your mind. Anticipate, account for it and you’ll see that it really isn’t any significant value as a total. 

  
tl:dr - If you had Egypt on your bucket list, don’t despair! Simply pay (enough) for someone to be your trusted buffer zone and help you navigate Egypt. You can have an absolute blast.

  
PS if you’ve read this far: I once mentioned to my cousin and his family in my dad’s country side town that they should open an anti-touristic-touristic experience on Airbnb/Getyourguide where they would take people from Cairo to their town to spend the day with them and actually experience real local Egypt (ie not one of these fake “local experiences”, which I had the horrible pleasure to witness myself in a “Nubian village” next to Aswan and was a complete trap). They didn’t know what Airbnb was, and did not seem to understand why would people be interested to have lunch at their place, and take a tour of their very-normal Egyptian town. Do drop a comment/DM if you think it would be a good idea, and I’ll share it back with them! ",1,1763258808.0,travel,6,0.52,False

I’m not a concept.
I’m not here to be your emotional support fantasy, your “save me from my loneliness” match, or the girl you test your self-confidence on. I’m a real human being with a real life, real depth, and real energy… and it takes someone who’s actually grounded and curious to show up for that.

I’m into connection with substance. Someone who wants to actually get to know me… not the surface assumptions, not the aesthetic, not the “wow you seem so confident, fix me” energy. I want someone who can talk about passions, creativity, what lights them up, what they’re building, and what kind of world they want around them.

And yes, attraction matters. Chemistry matters. Connection is emotional, mental and physical.
So here’s [a photo of me](https://imgur.com/a/fnsE9nZ) to avoid the “surprised Pikachu” moment later.

What I’m into lately:
• Emo, Punk Pop and Post-hardcore music 
• Horror, thrillers, and a good psychological mind bender
• Harry Potter
• Cooking and nesting
• Traveling for work (I’m in and out of different cities a lot)
• Dogs, coffee, wandering bookstores, weird little rabbit holes

What I’m not into:
• Men who trauma-dump in message #2
• Anyone who wants the benefits of intimacy without putting in effort
• Guys who think vulnerability = oversharing
• Anyone who can’t laugh, flirt, or be genuinely curious!

I’m not a concept.
I’m not here to be your emotional support fantasy, your “save me from my loneliness” match, or the girl you test your self-confidence on. I’m a real human being with a real life, real depth, and real energy… and it takes someone who’s actually grounded and curious to show up for that.

I’m into connection with substance. Someone who wants to actually get to know me… not the surface assumptions, not the aesthetic, not the “wow you seem so confident, fix me” energy. I want someone who can talk about passions, creativity, what lights them up, what they’re building, and what kind of world they want around them.

And yes, attraction matters. Chemistry matters. Connection is emotional, mental and physical.
So here’s [a photo of me](https://imgur.com/a/fnsE9nZ) to avoid the “surprised Pikachu” moment later.

What I’m into lately:
• Emo, Punk Pop and Post-hardcore music 
• Horror, thrillers, and a good psychological mind bender
• Harry Potter
• Cooking and nesting
• Traveling for work (I’m in and out of different cities a lot)
• Dogs, coffee, wandering bookstores, weird little rabbit holes

What I’m not into:
• Men who trauma-dump in message #2
• Anyone who wants the benefits of intimacy without putting in effort
• Guys who think vulnerability = oversharing
• Anyone who can’t laugh, flirt, or be genuinely curious!

If you’re intentional, kind, self-aware, have your own life and passions, and you actually want to see who I am rather than project who you need me to be then I think we’d get along.

1oy9hdd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oy9hdd,🥩 Trump's Beef with Australia is Over: Tariffs Scrapped on $2.6B Worth of Aussie Meat Exports,"Breaking: The United States has eliminated tariffs on Australian beef and over 200 other food products in a major policy reversal by President Trump.

Why This Matters:

Australia became America's largest red meat supplier in 2024, exporting A$4 billion ($2.64 billion) worth of beef annually – that's 30% of Australia's total beef exports. The tariff removal comes as American consumers face skyrocketing grocery bills, with Trump under pressure after recent Democratic election wins centered on affordability issues.

Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong called it a ""clear win for Australian beef producers,"" emphasizing benefits for both exporters and US consumers.

The Catch:

While beef gets the green light, Australia's steel and aluminium exports still face brutal 50% tariffs imposed in March 2025. The Albanese government continues pushing for relief, but Trump isn't budging yet.

The Bigger Picture:

This executive order, effective November 14, 2025, also slashed tariffs on coffee, tea, tomatoes, and bananas as part of Trump's strategy to address voter anger over inflation. Australia has shipped between 150,000-400,000 tonnes of beef to the US annually since 1990, with fast-food chains being major buyers.

What's your take – is this genuine trade relief or political theater before midterms?",0,1763258454.0,TrendoraX,4,0.5,False
1oy9hd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TanitaTikaram/comments/1oy9hd0/set_list_from_royal_festival_hall_show/,Set list from Royal Festival Hall show,"The show opened with Zosia Jagodzinska and her 'cello. She was described as ""ethereal"", and that barely covered it. Her first album comes out next year, and I'll be keeping an ear out for it!

Next up was Luke Sital-Singh, who combined self-depracating humour with songs of longing. The sound mixing was a bit off for his set, but he thanked the audience for not throwing things or setting the place on fire.

After the interval, the main feature! TT was supported by a band of seven:

* Bartek Glowacki (accordion)
* Zosia Jagodzinska ('cello)
* Midori Jaegar ('cello, piano, and vocals)
* Andy Monaghan (bass)
* Helen O'Hara (violin)
* Marc Pell (drums)
* Lewis McLaughlin (guitar and vocals)

They were also joined by seven members of the London Community Gospel Choir for a couple of songs.

I was blown away by TT's energy. She's six or seven years older than me, yet she was bouncing around the stage like someone half my age!

The songs performed:

* World outside your window
* I don't wanna lose at love
* Glass love train
* This perfect friend
* Cathedral song
* Cool waters
* Heavy pressure
* Valentine heart
* Love isn't a right
* Dust on my shoes
* Wild is the wind
* Lover don't come around
* Fais moi le solitude
* Turn the lights down low
* Twist in my sobriety
* Sweet feather & the storm
* I see a morning (LCGC)

And then the encore:

* May you never (MJ and LM)
* Good tradition
* Love is in the air

I didn't recognise ""I don't wanna lose at love"" at first, because they played a different arrangement and dropped the riff from ""Seelinnikoi"" by Värttinä. ""Valentine heart"" was just TT and HOH, and left a tear running down my face.

It was also educational! I learned that ""Glass love train"" is a tribute to Philip Glass, and ""Turn the lights down low"" is a song about coping with the current state of the world by going out and getting drunk. ""Lover don't come around"" is a song about first love, while ""Dust on my shoes"" is about finding a safe space. 

My only complaint was the absence of ""Feeding the witches"" (and possibly ""Consider the rain""). However, an unexpected (and very welcome) thing happened while we were having coffee down in the food market. We were standing near the Artists' Entrance when a vaguely familiar person strode past. I had to look twice to confirm that it was Ramon! I guess they're no longer estranged.

1oy9h44,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oy9h44/little_black_worm/,Little Black Worm,"Who up Creeping They Cast?

This is my first post! I have had this idea for a while, so I finally decided to get pen to paper and write out a somewhat fleshed-out story. I'm quite happy with how it turned out, but I am always open to discussion :) Thank you for your time <3

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I sighed as I tried to unzip my ancient army coat. The damn zipper was caught again.

*You really should have waxed it like your father had told you to.*

He was right, as usual.

I should have waxed it when I had the chance. Now I looked like a fool trapped in a green duffel bag. I tried again in vain to break free from the confines of my jacket until I admitted defeat and slipped the coat up and over my head. 

I threw the restraint onto my bed and plopped down next to it.

*You really shouldn't have said that tonight; it was such a strange addition to the conversation. You should really be more sensitive to others' feelings.*

Right again.

""Hopefully she will still come to next month's movie,"" I said to myself as I walked to the mirror to wash off tonight's events.

*You shouldn't put your hopes up*. The little black worm whispered in my ear. Of course, He was never wrong, but some nights I secretly wished He would be. I scrupulously wiped away the dirt and toweled off as I looked at myself in the mirror. I could see the little black worm wriggling under my skin. His bulbous, uneven body creating ripples in my cheeks, wriggling and writhing its way down to my neck.

*Perhaps if you reveal a bit more of what is underneath, she will forgive you.*

He was never wrong. 

The worm slowly made His way down my shoulders and into my forearms as I obeyed His orders. The little black worm and I had been living in this routine ever since I could remember.

Throughout our life together, the worm had grown and grown with every order I followed. At first, He was no larger than a scratch or a small scrape. Through high school, He grew to about the length of a finger or two with a thick body that would wrap His way around my throat and arms. Sometimes the worm was able to take over certain parts of my body to help me. He would shimmy to my ankles if my legs had frozen to keep me walking, or wrap around my larynx to stop me from speaking. Although He had caused great anguish throughout my life, I was thankful for His help. Without my little black worm, I would be nothing.

But, there were moments, of course, very rare occasions, that the worm would frighten me. Sometimes, His maternal whisper, soft and quiet in my ear, would become a thunderous hiss that would reverberate into my skull, bouncing from every bone, vein, and nerve. Sometimes I would try to drown Him out, but I would always be able to hear His orders.

*YOU SHOULD BE WORKING* 

*WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?* 

*YOU BELONG TO ME* 

*YOU CANNOT IGNORE ME*

*FEED ME*

Sometimes, the aggravation and rage of the worm would become too much, and I knew I would need to be punished.

*Feed me with your hands, reveal the inside, the truth, you know the shame you bring.*

I would follow my orders, but I knew this was all done from love. The worm loved me; He helped me. He told me what to do, and I obeyed.

I washed the blood from my hands and made a sleepy march from the bathroom to my bed. Sweet, sweet bed.

I had been spending more and more time in bed lately. While I protested this growing habit, the worm insisted it would help.

*You should rest; that is why you have not returned. We need to rest.*

I watched as the worm climbed between my veins into my thighs. When I was younger, this visual frightened me. A thick, meaty tube that writhed just under my skin like a moving bruise. The purple-black hue of its alien body clearly visible under my skin. Mum always said I bruised like a peach, just like her.

I winced as the worm continued to search my body. Sometimes I could dilute the pain through certain positions that created an easier path through my maze of muscles and flesh. It never used to hurt, but since the coffee spilled, it felt like the worm had grown thorns, scraping deep scars into my meat that burned with every inch traveled. I had reached a point where I now needed to sleep on dark sheets to avoid the suspicion of blood as He oozed from my body at night.

*You should accept your fate. This is done out of love*.

I knew this was the truth. The worm loved me. He wanted to protect me.

He hissed in agreement as He moved His polluted shadow from my hips up my throat. Recently, the worm had started blocking my throat. Not to block any life from entering, but to allow a moment of pause while I considered His orders. Although I always obeyed, it was a reminder of how He had built me to be the best version of myself. I owed my life to the worm. I loved the worm.

I stared down at the holy silver in my hand. Love was a strange thing. Some days, it revealed such beauty in the world that you could scarcely believe it to be true; other days, it lifted the veil and revealed the cold underbelly that supported this illusion. Of course, the worm always told me that I existed to create this illusion for others.

*You should be thrilled to have the opportunity to create this for others.*

*Why would it exist for you?*

The wise, ancient serpent continued climbing my muscle tissue. His grotesque, thick body clouded my vision as I watered the tendrils that escaped from my mouth. A sticky ooze excreting from its oily skin sealed my lips. But this was normal; the worm knew what was best. He loved me.

*You should not think of me as a burden but as a martyr. I save you while living beneath your skin. I exist only for you. Someday I will grow to save others, and you will come with me.*

The snake grew and elongated into my limbs and spine. Its reptilian skin growning and sharpening with each notch down my back. I could feel Him replacing the muscles in my body. Taking control.

*We could live together, exist in eternity. You could make them proud. You could remove their pain, their suffering.*

I thought of my family, my friends, and the pain that life had dealt them at my expense. I thought of eternity as the snake continued into the vast crevices in my decaying, mushy cranium. An eternity of servitude with my master. Freedom.

I raised the familiar grey weight in my hand.

After all, the worm was always right.",2,1763258436.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1oy9edy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1oy9edy/my_journey/,My Journey,"So many stories in here - people sharing when they’re in their worst, flaring, or maybe 25 years in remission. I hope I can provide some hope despite not being all the way in the clear. 

I went from virtually no symptoms to having a blockage in my TI about 7 weeks ago. I had stomach pains that got worse during the day and by 10pm I was throwing up. By 11pm I was throwing up what smelt like poop. By 3am I was in the ER getting a high dose of prednisone and a OG tube Down in my stomach to pump everything out to relieve pressure. By the next day things were moving again and after two nights I was back home. 

Due to my mother having Crohn’s and the location of the blockage, my GI doc was convinced it was crohns and the colonoscopy confirmed. I’m still on a long taper off of prednisone - 60mg for two weeks, 50 for two weeks, 40 30 20 10. 

I’ve talked with a nutritionist since then and found a great plan for supplements (fish oil / omega 3, daily multivitamin, sugar free electrolytes, calcium + D) - we talked about reintroduction plan for foods (avoiding all raw veggie, spicy, skins, soda, alcohol since going in)

Here’s what I’ll say for hope, and many address very common questions that I know people come here wondering (me included) and seek validation to not find “the worst”

- since getting “back to normal” after leaving the hospital, I think I’ve had one non solid poop in 7 weeks
- I poop once a day
- I drink coffee with non dairy creamer daily
- prednisone is not a btch for me. I had some achy joints when I was on 60mg but besides that, it’s not affecting me with any other side effects. No moon face. Holding weight. Not breaking out. No mental effects. 
- walking daily is a life saver. Get moving. Get outside.  
- I had my first Skyrizi loading dose about 30 hours ago. It was very easy and I’m having no initial side effects. 

I can’t tell you if skyrizi will work. I can’t tell you I won’t flare. I went from a seemingly normal life to crohns diagnosis pretty fast with no symptoms giving me trouble until the blockage and some dairy sensitivity. 

But overall what I’m finding is this. Everyone in this journey is different. It’s effecting no two people the same. Coming here for validation won’t give it to you. People come here when they’re hurting. I hope I can give you the other side of it. 

Don’t let crohns become you. I keep getting “oh I’m
so sorry” - for me, I’m choosing to remain unbothered and not needing sympathy. Plenty of people have conditions worse than me. Cancers. Alzheimer’s. Maybe your crohns has you down bad right now (or all the time) - maybe like me you’re just starting. Stay strong. Mindset wins. God bless.

Hindi ko talaga alam kung itutuloy ko pa ba yung panunuyo sa cashier na kapalagayang loob ko. Ang dami na naming sweet moments, siya pa nga yung madalas nagyayaya ng date, pero nalaman ko na may ibang nanliligaw din pala sa kanya. Gusto ko sana ako lang yung nasa isip niya, pero wala pa kaming label kaya naguguluhan ako kung magpapatuloy pa ba ako o bitawan na lang.  

Context:  
Service staff ako sa isang fastfood chain, madalas graveyard shift. May cashier kami na sobrang comfortable daw siya sakin at gusto niya lagi ako kasama sa shift. Ang dami din nanliligaw sa kanya sa counter, pero ako yung lagi niyang kinakausap, sabay kumakain, sabay break. Nagstart kami magchat dahil sa kape na hindi ko nainom, dun nagsimula yung kulitan at tawanan namin. Dalawa na kaming nag-date: una sa kapehan, pangalawa sa Pasig Esplanade. Sa second date sobrang saya ko kasi naglakad kami ng malayo, nagkwentuhan ng matagal, tapos sa jeep pauwi sumandal siya sakin kasi inaantok. First time ko maranasan yun kaya sobrang kilig. Nag-photobooth din kami, may mga pictures na memory. Lagi siya nagtatanong kung may gf na ba ako at ano stand ko sa cheating. Sa third meetup, tinulungan ko siya sa project niya, pero natulog siya sa bahay namin kasi pareho kaming galing graveyard. Niyakap ko siya habang natutulog, nagcaress ng hair at back niya, ok lang daw sa kanya. Nahuli kami ni papa kaya kinausap ako, sabi kung seryoso ako ipakilala ko siya. Pinapunta ko siya sa bahay, nakilala ng family ko, nagustuhan siya ng lolo ko kasi magaan kausap. Kumain kami, nagbonding pa sila. Habang nagaabang ng tricycle, naging clingy siya: hinimas baba ko, hawak braso at bicep ko.  

Pero recently, nalaman ko na may ibang manliligaw pala sa kanya, isang customer na lagi siyang dinadalhan ng Jollibee. Medyo na-down ako kasi akala ko ako lang yung gusto niya. Hindi ko siya masisisi kasi wala pa kaming label, pero parang sumobra expectations ko. Hindi ko siya masyado pinansin sa store anniversary, pero binigyan ko pa rin siya ng plato, kutsara, at coffee jelly kahit nagkakaubusan na.  

Previous Attempts:  
Sa lahat ng date namin, hindi ko siya pinapabayad kahit siya yung madalas magpilit. Lagi ko siyang inaantay kumain, sabay kami palagi. Tinulungan ko siya sa project niya kahit pagod ako. Pinakilala ko siya sa family ko kahit wala pa kaming aminan. Kahit down ako nung nalaman ko may ibang nanliligaw, pinapakita ko pa rin na nandiyan ako—kahit sa simpleng bagay gaya ng pagbibigay ng coffee jelly.

1oy98my,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1oy98my/doordash_driver_came_on_my_cookies/,Doordash driver came on my cookies,"Someone please tell me I'm insane and there's a simple explanation, or it's not a big deal, or this isn't going to ruin my entire life, or this didn't actually happen, anything. I have no one to talk to about this and I need literally anything from anyone. I've been going back and forth between denial and disocciating. Writing this on mobile in one go so I apologize for any errors. Not that it matters because I'm pretty sure I'm dreaming right now.

Last night around midnight I got intense sugar cravings. I'm not usually someone with a sweet tooth but this has been happening a lot lately, probably because of depression or a hormonal imbalance that I've been working with doctors to try to figure out (or both). I impulsively decided to get doordash from a nearby bakery. I'm wary of ghost kitchens so I made sure to pick a chain establishment that I'm familiar with. I've been to one of their locations in person, but not this one specifically.

I bought a pint of ice cream, half a dozen cookies, and a brownie. (yes I was planning on eating all of this in one night) The delivery took longer than expected because the driver had another stop on the way. No big deal, just 10 or 15 minutes, I can just pop the ice cream in the freezer if it's started to melt. I did a contact-free delivery because I'm afraid of talking to people. The driver dropped off the bag by the front door of my apartment building and drove away by the time I picked it up.

First red flag was that the bag didn't have a doordash receipt. I've gotten doordash a lot and there's always a receipt either taped or stapled to the outside of the bag. I double checked the photo the dasher sent just to make sure this was what he dropped off, and it was.

Second red flag was the bag itself. It didn't look like packaging that an established bakery chain would use. It was a big brown paper bag that was held shut by clear packing tape. The tape was wrapped all the way around the bag in two places. 

Third thing, not necessarily a red flag but just kind of strange, was that my name was written in sharpie on the bag but slightly misspelled. I don't know if that means anything but I thought I should mention it just in case.

When I brought the bag to my apartment and opened it I immediately got a really weird feeling. The inside of the bag didn't smell like a bakery, or cookies, or ice cream. I don't really know how to explain it, but it smelled like a person. You know how if a guy doesn't wash his sheets or keep his window open, when you step into his room you can immediately smell that ""person"" smell? That's what it instantly reminded me of. I felt really weird but I told myself it had been in this guy's car for a while so of course it would smell a bit like his car. (which doesn't really explain why the INSIDE of the bag would smell like that so much but I didn't want to think about it)

Then I saw the pint of ice cream, which was in a completely blank, all-white container. No label or branding or anything. I opened it and there was no seal. I've never bought a pint from this chain before so maybe the ice cream just comes like that, but the photos on doordash show pints with fully designed containers. But it was really late at night and also near the end of the week, so maybe they just ran out of the branded containers and had to use a cheap backup? Again, I felt weird but brushed it off and just put the ice cream in the freezer. I have a history of anxiety and paranoia and this is not the first time I've thought of the possibility of a doordash driver tampering with my food. I know it's a terrible thing to assume about someone I know literally nothing about, which is why I told myself that everything so far was nothing to be worried about.

The cookies and brownie were all piled in a smaller brown bag within the bigger bag. I took out just the brownie and ate half of it. Then I took out the double chocolate cookie. When I looked at it I was disappointed because I thought they gave me the wrong cookie. It looked like a chocolate cookie with white macadamia, or maybe white chocolate. Then I turned it over and realized there weren't any white spots on the bottom. I took a closer look and saw that the white spots on the top were not nuts or chocolate. It kind of looked like frosting, I guess. There were just two or three spots sitting on top of one half of the cookie. I sniffed it and it didn't smell sweet. It didn't really smell like anything, just vaguely musky like the rest of the inside of the bag. I assumed they somehow spilled frosting on it and I put the cookie down.

That's around the time when it really hit me that something weird could be going on. The first thing I thought was basically ""wow they made a mistake at the bakery that happens to look like the one thing that would ruin me the most. That's kind of crazy."" But the more I thought about it, the more I felt sick. The lack of receipt, the weird packaging, the smell. I had this mental image of the driver opening my package then resealing it with his own bag and tape. I told myself over and over that it was just frosting or ice cream on my cookie but I couldn't stop thinking about it and it didn't make sense. This place only serves cookies and ice cream, they don't even sell anything that would have frosting on it.

(At this point I should mention I have never actually seen cum in real life. I don't know what it looks like. I didn't think it could actually be so white or thick, or look so much like frosting. I don't particularly want to do research into this topic to confirm. Maybe someone in the comments can enlighten me. Can it actually look like frosting, and does it really form such a solid shape when it dries??)

I took one more cookie out of the bag and looked at it. It didn't have any white spots but it did have some sort of translucent substance on top. It seemed to be drizzled all over it in an erratic pattern. When I saw this, even though I didnt have a real point of reference I just knew. Most of my brain was still in denial (and still is, tbh) but at this point I knew.

I didn't want to look at any more cookies. I didn't want to look further into this situation at all. I felt like my brain was floating out of my body. I silently put the cookies, brownie, and ice cream back into the bag, put the bag into a big trash bag, tied it up, and threw it down the trash chute. I know I probably should have taken pictures or kept the evidence or something but I couldn't stand the idea of having those pictures on my phone for even a second, and I didn't want to report this or anything. I just wanted it to be over. I went to my doordash account and changed my name and address, logged out, and deleted the app. I considered deleting my account but I thought that might somehow remove the record of this purchase ever happening, which seemed like a bad idea. I also took a screenshot of the driver's name and the delivery photo he sent. Not sure what the point was since I'm not planning on doing anything about this but it seemed like something I should do. Now I just have that screenshot sitting on my phone as a reminder that this really happened. Great.

I know the correct thing to do is to report this. I know i shouldn't have thrown it all away without even a picture. But I can't. I know it's selfish and stupid. I just can't. It's going to take everything I have just to get an std test. I only ate half of the brownie and it looked and tasted fine but you never know. 

I was hoping I could just go to sleep and forget about this but it was the first thing I thought of when I woke up. I got out of bed at 3 pm and the first thing I consumed was a glass of whiskey. I used to love this whiskey but it just tastes so gross and bitter to me now. As I was making coffee I started hyperventilating and almost passed out. Now I feel nothing. I keep having meltdowns that last a minute then I'm stoic again. I keep expecting to wake up from this dream. Can anyone please tell me that this isn't real life? I have severe ptsd that's kept me away from anything sexual for my entire life and one of my very worst fears has come true. I'm also disabled and intensely agoraphobic, and food delivery was a life saver. Now I can't ever use doordash or any sort of delivery service ever again.

Not sure how to conclude this post. Not really sure what kind of response I'm hoping for, either. I just can't keep this to myself and I don't know where else to go. I do have a therapist but I can't talk to her until Monday. Someone please help me. Thanks for reading.",1,1763257744.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,0.6,False

Hi everyone — I’m looking for some advice from people who’ve run small food stands or farmers-market setups.

I’m planning to start a simple breakfast table offering hot oatmeal with dried fruit toppings, plus tea and coffee. Nothing fancy — just a clean, consistent morning option.

Before I go through permits and setup, I’d love some insight from people who’ve done something similar:

• For a small table with a couple coffee makers and a large pot of oatmeal, what equipment/food-safety requirements should I expect?
• Are there common mistakes new vendors make with temporary food permits?
• Anything I should know about keeping oatmeal hot safely without needing a full kitchen?
• Any tips for managing power, hot water, or transport?
• What’s a realistic startup cost for this kind of stall?

I’m planning to operate in the North Vancouver/Lower Mainland area, so BC/Canadian experience is especially helpful — but general advice is welcome.

Thanks to anyone willing to share their experience.",1,1763257646.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False

RIFT – The Speedster
Rift can run faster than sound—fast enough to blur out of a room before a heartbeat finishes. No one knew his consequences, you might think that’s a good thing. It never has been 

2. HAVEN – Flight & Super Strength 

Haven floats like a ghost and hits like a wrecking ball.
People see a fortress. A tank. Someone unbreakable.

They don’t see the truth: the higher he flies, the more gravity punishes him.
Every landing sends shockwaves up his spine. Microfractures lace his ribs and collarbones. And his strength is fueled by his adrenal system—meaning every time he lifts something impossible, he’s aging his heart one beat closer to failure.

When Haven saves someone, he’s gambling with his lifespan.

3. SWITCH – Teleportation

Switch disappears in a blink and reappears anywhere she can picture. Sounds perfect.
Except every jump scrambles her sense of self.

Her memories glitch—out of order, out of time, sometimes not even hers. She’ll teleport across a city and forget how she got there. Forget who she was talking to. Forget entire days.

Worst of all: every jump risks leaving a part of her behind.

4. MNEMONIC – Infinite Knowledge

He knows everything. Every equation, every secret, every probability.

But his mind wasn’t built to hold infinity.
Thoughts pile like bricks in a collapsing tower. His brain overheats, migraines like sniper shots through his skull. He doesn’t sleep—when he closes his eyes, he sees more.

Mnemonic knows a million ways the world can die…
and he knows he’s the only thing delaying every one of them.

Powers aren’t what they’re all hyped out to be. 



CHAPTER ONE 
I woke up late.
Again.

Checked my phone — I was six hours behind.
Perfect.

I threw on my uniform and sprinted to headquarters, still half-asleep.
“Alright team, let’s get to work,” I muttered as I dropped into my chair, opened my laptop, and took the first sip of coffee I desperately needed.

I’m a dispatcher for a group of heroes called The Liberators.
I’m the guy in the chair — the one who sends them out, keeps comms steady, and prays no one dies on my shift.

One of them, Rift, has been sweating and having panic attacks every day.
Not because of villains.
Because he doesn’t know what his consequence is.

Everyone with powers pays a price.
Some bleed.
Some break.
Some lose their minds.
And Rift… doesn’t know his yet.

They benched him because of it, and he’s been ranting to me nonstop.
Honestly? I get it. Not knowing is worse than knowing.

I was mid-sip when I felt a breath on my neck.

“Dude… please help me.”
Rift’s voice shook.
I turned and his eyes were glazed over, like he was seconds from crying.

“I’m sorry, man. I literally just clocked in. I’ll check later — try Mike’s lab.”

He nodded and walked off, shoulders slumped.

I turned back to my screen just as a call came in — a woman sobbing.

“Please help us! The building’s on fire!”

I put her on hold and sent Switch.
She teleported instantly… then called back.

“Hey, uh… what’d you ask me to do?”

I closed my eyes and groaned.
“The fire, Switch. Save the people inside—”

But by the time she remembered…

They were already gone.

Five children.
Three teenagers.
Six adults.

Sixteen lives lost because powers in this world always take something.



CHAPTER TWO
Tuesday.
Early morning.
Not our normal schedule.

I woke up at five and drove through pouring rain toward the headquarters meeting room, where the mayor and half the city’s officers were already waiting.

The sun wasn’t even up.
Beautiful day.

I sighed, parked, and took my time walking in — stalling like a coward. My head pounded hard enough to split my skull and my heart felt like it was trying to claw its way out of my chest.

I reached the door, hand shaking on the cold silver handle, and forced myself inside. Every step felt heavier than the last. I sat.

“Morning,” the mayor said, stern and cold.

I swallowed, forced a smile. “Morning, Mister Mayor.”

“I’m sure you know why I called this meeting,” he said, sliding two files across the table.

“By the end of the week, you will cut one member from your team.”

Cut them.
Like this was a sports team and not the only family I had.

He stood, the officers following.
“I expect the decision by Friday.”

Then he left.

I stared at the two folders — the lowest-ranked Liberators.

Rift.
Or Switch.

I slipped both files into my bag and walked out. My desk felt safer, even if it wasn’t.

“Morning!” Haven said through the headset, cheerful as always.

I smiled despite everything. “Morning, Haven. Ready to get to work?”

“You bet!”

A call rang in. I put the caller on hold and said, “Bank robbery in the west district.”

His tracker flew across my screen, and then I heard him wince as he landed.

“You okay?” I asked.

“Yup! All good!”

Sure. Right.

Everything was fine until Haven spoke again.

“Uh… Jay? You seeing this?”

I leaned forward. A red dot had appeared next to his tracker.

“What is that?”

He flew upward and then his voice came through, breathless:

“A giant fucking robot!”

Those were his exact words before something slapped him out of the sky and sent him crashing through six buildings.

“I’m sending backup—just hold him off!” I said, typing like my life depended on it.

Mirage arrived fast.

“Holy hell, Jay,” she said. “What happened?”

“Giant robot,” I muttered.

It took them thirty brutal minutes to destroy the mech.

Haven’s voice cracked through the comms, wet and garbled. “Jay…?”

“Yeah? You alright?”

Mirage carried him inside before he could answer. He was bleeding everywhere — arms bent wrong, three teeth stuck straight through his upper lip. Mirage had cuts but she was fine.

“What happened!?” I yelled, rushing to him with the med kit.

“The fucking mech, that’s what!” she snapped.

I lifted Haven and carried him into our medical room. Downey immediately helped me lay him down and started prepping tools to cut the teeth out of his lip.

The silence was awful. Heavy.

“I’m going to find Mnemonic,” I finally said.

They nodded without looking up.

I walked to Mnemonic’s room and opened the door.

A wave of rot hit me.

He sat in the middle of the room, in complete darkness, head tilted unnaturally to the right. His skull was swollen, drooping over his shoulder, spilling down his back like melted wax.

“Mn… Mnemonic?”

Nothing.

“Hey. Can you hear me?”
Still nothing.

I stepped closer, hand shaking, and grabbed his shoulder.

I shook him.

The advisor said I could go the nearest t-Mobile store and swap it for a new one.  After doing the twenty minute drive to the store, they noted they haven’t taken equipment swap for months.

I should’ve never gone up that mountain.,"My father and I loved hiking. Not the casual kind — the kind where the air thins, where the wind feels like knives, and every step burns. He used to say the cold “washed the noise off his mind.”
I never understood that until I was older.

That day was supposed to be one of those days.

We had a cabin we always used as a starting point. Same place every time. Same routine. Coffee. Map check. Climb.

But when I got there, he wasn’t.

At first, I didn’t panic. The road up the mountain gets icy, and the forest can swallow sound. I figured he got held up. But an hour passed. Then two.

I called him. No answer. I called again. Nothing.

My father was a serious man — scheduled, strict, always early. His missing a planned hike wasn’t just unlike him. It was impossible.

I stayed in that cabin for six days.

I must’ve called his phone seven times a day. Eventually, I realized I wasn’t calling to reach him — I was calling just to hear the ringing. If the line was still live, then maybe he was too.

I should’ve called 911 immediately. But fear makes you stupid. Fear makes you small.

So I did the only thing that felt real:
I followed the plan.

I went to the mountain.
I started climbing.

Something was wrong the moment I stepped onto the trail.

The air wasn’t just cold — it was dead.
No birds. No insects. No rustling leaves. Just the crunch of frost under my boots. The world felt like it was holding its breath.

Halfway up, the sun slipped behind the ridge. The trees stretched long, thin shadows across the path. Everything dimmed.

I checked my watch — too late to keep going. I found a flat ledge near a stone outcrop and set up camp.

That’s when I found the first bone.

Not small. Not an animal. Something long. Thick. Snapped clean down the center. The marrow was hollowed out. The white is stained, brown, and flaking.

Something had eaten it.

Recently.

The bone was still wet.

My chest tightened. It looked human.

But it couldn’t be.
My father was strong. Unbreakable.

“What did you get yourself into, Dad?”

Sleep never came. Every time I shut my eyes, I saw his breath in the cold. Heard him laughing on the trail. And beneath that memory: something hungry. Something waiting.

Then I heard it.

Movement in the brush. Slow at first. Then heavier. Closer.

Then his voice.

“Son… I’ve been waiting up here. Took your sweet time.”

For a moment, I almost unzipped the tent. But the voice was off — too loose, too soft. My father always spoke like he was cutting through stone.
This voice sagged. Melted.

I unzipped the tent just an inch.

A figure stood in the dark. Wrong size. Wrong shape. A foot too tall. Limbs too long. And above its shoulders —

A deer skull.

Before I could react, something slashed. The tent tore open. Claws ripped across my arm. I felt blood soak into my sleeve, hot against the cold air. I screamed and threw myself out onto the frozen ground.

I ran — blind, panicked — feet pounding the trail, breath burning my throat.

I didn’t realize I was running up the mountain, not down, until the trees thinned and cold stars opened overhead.

The summit.

I was bleeding. Dizzy. No cover. No way to hide.

Then I heard it again.

“Son…”

It stepped into view.

A towering, skeletal body. Skin stretched thin over bone. A massive deer skull for a head, antlers branching like black lightning. But its mouth — too human — moved beneath the bone.

“You shouldn’t have run. I’m hungrier now.”

It charged.

I curled up, arms over my head, bracing for the strike.

But when it hit me, it didn’t break me. I was heavier than expected. I felt it lose footing. Saw the antlers tilt. Claws scraping rock. Then —

It fell.

I heard it tumbling. Branches snapping. Stone cracking. Then silence.

I never checked if it survived.

I just kept walking until I saw headlights. A ranger’s truck. A real voice.

I never saw my father again.

I still hike. It’s the only place I feel close to him. But I won’t go back to that mountain.

Not yet.

Maybe one day, when I’m ready, I’ll go back and talk to him.",12,1763256944.0,nosleep,2,0.93,False

Author: Andrew Fleet

For my sister — for always being the first reader of every strange idea that turned into something real.


---

They were arguing on the street. Not shouting—just unraveling. The kind of public tension people pretend not to notice while still feeling its weight.

The pavement was wet from the earlier rain. Streetlight reflections stretched long across the puddles. Cars passed slowly, as if the entire city agreed to move more carefully around them.

Respect arrived first.

She stood a few steps away, hands in her coat pockets, posture steady. She watched the couple the way one observes a distant storm—quietly, without interfering.

A man approached and came to stand beside Respect.
He walked with the deliberate certainty of someone who understood the cost of every decision. Respect handed him a coffee.

Where they stood, also stood a lamp post just next to them.

It should have lit their shoulders, but it didn’t.

The light bent around them — more around the man than Respect — but the effect was visible on both.

The light curved away from him.
Not dramatically. Not in streaks or sparks.
It simply avoided him, as if acknowledging his presence
while refusing to claim him.

His hat sat at a slight angle — the way hats used to sit on men who never needed to pretend to be confident.
He breathed like the night belonged to him.

That was Responsibility.
(Though no one said his name.)

He accepted the coffee with care, lifting it to his lips with the slow precision of someone who carried weight even in small gestures. He observed the couple with a thoughtful, measured gaze—calculating, deciding whether this was a moment that required intervention.

He was being responsible.
Respect respected that.

She never got in his way.

“Another one?” she asked, eyes drifting to the cup in his hand.

The man let out a quiet breath—more amused than irritated.

“Sorry, my love. It was too easy.”

Respect allowed herself a small smirk, then turned her attention back to the couple.

The woman spoke again.

“How are we even supposed to get baby formula now, John? Did you even think of that? No—no, because all you ever do is think of yourself.”

The words tumbled out quickly, heavy and relentless. Not sharp enough to cut—but weighted enough to bruise. She didn’t leave him space to breathe. She kept going, driven by exhaustion, fear, and the kind of pressure that only comes from loving something small and helpless.

John said nothing. His chest folded inward more with each sentence, as if her words had mass.

The more he collapsed, the more she expanded.

The man watched the imbalance with quiet intensity.
Respect watched him watching.

The woman inhaled to fire off the next sentence.

The man placed his coffee back in Respect’s hands.

He stepped forward.
Tilted his head.
Measured the moment one last time.

Then he snapped his fingers.

A single, clean sound.

Time stopped.

Traffic froze.
Pedestrians halted mid-step.
A streetlamp’s flicker paused mid-beat.
The city held its breath.

Respect stepped back.
The man stepped back.

And the woman vanished.

No dramatic flare.
No distortion.
Just a clean removal from the moment.

She reappeared somewhere else entirely.



The Somme, 1916

Mud thick beneath her boots. Trenches torn into the earth. Smoke hanging low, unsure which direction the wind wanted it to go.

Artillery shook the ground in slow, distant bursts—but each blast was followed by a thin, fragile sound. Something that sounded like a baby crying through closed walls.

Not a metaphor.
Just how weight translated itself here.

She walked forward.

Bodies lay across the shredded earth. Every face belonged to her husband. Eyes half-open. Arms slack. Still.

None had bullet wounds.
None had been shredded by shrapnel.
Every single one had the same, precise injury:

A bayonet wound directly in the heart.

She didn’t recoil.
It made a kind of awful sense.

Living soldiers rushed past her—every single one of them wearing her face. Her expression. Her exhaustion. Her fear. Endless versions of her, moving with mechanical urgency.

A battlefield made of her actions.
A graveyard made of his consequences.

Then the charge began.

Dozens of her sprinted across the field, boots thudding in rhythm with the crying artillery. Bayonets fixed. Expressions blank. Purpose absolute.

One broke away and charged directly at her.

She didn’t run.
She didn’t fight.
She had no weapon to raise.

The bayonet entered her heart cleanly, without hesitation. The exact shape of the harm she had placed on him again and again—close, quiet, unintentional.

Her truth surfaced at the moment of impact.

“I wish I was kinder to my husband.”

Secrecy caught it instantly.
Nothing escaped her.
Nothing returned.

Responsibility absorbed the weight.

Then the world folded.



A splash of cold water struck her cheek.


She gasped—back on the street as a taxi rolled through a puddle beside her. Droplets clung to her face like remnants of another life. The city resumed its motion. A pedestrian stepped forward. Brake lights pulsed. Everything continued exactly as it had.

John stood in front of her, unchanged.
From his perspective, she had never left.

The street resumed — people walking,
cars passing, life continuing
as if she had only flinched at a splash.

No one had noticed what happened.
No one ever does.

Because the hardest lessons are private,
and the most important corrections leave
no mark.

She didn’t speak.
She didn’t apologize.
But she understood.

For the first time in her life, she understood.



Across the street,
the man took the
coffee back from Respect’s hands.

He sipped it like he had all the time in
the world — which in a way, he did.

Respect brushed her fingers against his
arm. Not to guide him — just to let
him know she was there.

“Slow down,” she murmured.

He smiled, the kind of smile that didn’t
need light.

They walked away together.

Step by step.
Fading not upward or outward, but sideways —
slipping into a direction the world didn’t track.

Because they were never meant to stay long.

They exist where time doesn’t.

And they are only ever here when the world becomes
imbalanced.

It is the most honest piece of work I have crafted yet.

So as the title says, my(23F) two friends (22F and 23M) started dating about 10 months ago, and now I have been excluded from essentially everything they do. I will call them John and Amy I guess. Amy is also my roommate, and was before they started dating. We all met in college but they didn’t get together until the end of our last year. Because Amy and I live together, this leads to very awkward situations where they will be discussing going and getting lunch or dinner/going thrifting/getting coffee/etc. in front of me, and I feel the want to ask if I can go but I’m usually unsure of how to tell if it’s appropriate to ask or if they want it to be more private like a date. I have a very hard time understanding social cues which makes this even more difficult, and I know and understand that they’d want to do things alone because they’re dating, so it’s not that i’m jealous of their time together or something like that. It’s more that all of these things we used to just do together before they were dating all throughout college. John would constantly be at our place and we’d just go do things and it was never weird or awkward, because we were all extremely close. 

I don’t really have any other friends if I’m being honest, which makes my situation even worse, as I literally don’t have any other option of people to hang out with, meaning on the rare occasions I do go somewhere with them I’m always third wheeling. It’s kinda crazy to me just how much them starting to date has changed our entire dynamic. We also have a groupchat that neither of them even look at anymore when I send something because they just text eachother now. They’ve literally in front of me have talked about something they were texting to each other and then were like oh oops we thought we sent that in the group chat. 

My most recent situation that left me feeling extremely unwanted was them asking if I could DD them to a party and then pick them up later. This party was I believe hosted by one of John’s friends (and it’s not like I don’t know his friends, we’ve all hung out before!) and I told them I was tired and really didn’t want to, and they kinda tried to convince me before realizing it wasn’t worth it and called an Uber. 

I guess I don’t really know how to even bring this up to them, because I’m not upset that they’re dating but I have an extremely hard time describing my emotions and how I feel, and the last time I told a different group of friends how I felt excluded they assured me that wasn’t the case, and then all of them completely cut me off and stopped talking to me. Obviously this is probably the main thing stopping me from telling them how I feel, but I just really needed to put this in words somewhere and hoped maybe someone here has had a similar situation happen and could offer advice/comfort.

I just really don’t want to lose them, but I also don’t know how much longer I can handle not being asked to do things with them anymore. 

TL;DR Only two friends started dating, don’t include me in things we used to all do together anymore, wanted me to chauffeur them. I declined, it was awkward, IDK what to do about it, will prob delete this if I get too anxious about it. That’s all.

About 9 years later I was using Mud/wtr as a coffee replacement and had another breakthrough seizure. Neurologist wasn’t convinced that it could have been the adaptogenic mushrooms (there’s some data showing they increase metabolism in liver), but I’m pretty sure that was it.
That being said, it’s been just over year since that seizure and I’m having focal seizures. They usually start with my left arm going numb, focal seizure in my tongue then a grand mal.

GLM 4.6 does ""okay"" with multiple NPCs, but not super great. I stopped bothering to try with heavy-ish Lorebooks with GLM. I still did try to make it multiple NPC friendly because I like it when the minor NPCs talk. This is focused on third person, I am not going to work on first or second person.

I took out a lot of stuff (although it doesn't look like it) like harder plot armor settings, etc because I don't want to deal with the upkeep; it's not GPT, Claude, or Gemini; it can't handle that much stuff super great when you have so much other things you're throwing at it. Sure, it can follow prompts, but it can only follow so many prompts. This won't work on GPT 5.1 because I took out the prefills, etc and made changes to try and clean it up.
