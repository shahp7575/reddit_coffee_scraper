We are completely new to coffee machines and have only made at home moka (Bialetti) and even instant coffee when running in the morning... I know.

My wife is Italian and I love good things so it's time to get us an automatic coffee machine.

The old eletta cappuccino Is now about 520€ new. But is and almost decade old design. The Dinamica Plus (model of a year ago) can be bough for 590€ on sale, but does not heat cups and people complain about milk not being hot enough.

Any advice to help us decide which one to get? If it helps we have eat a coffee in the morning during the weak (next ones are in the office) and then 2 to 3 each on the weekend days. Cappuccino in the morning, macchiato or espresso later.

I’d love some insight because I’m really confused and feeling kind of discarded.

I was casually reconnecting with a guy I dated for a few months a while back. He was actively courting me. He got me flowers, little gifts, skincare, took me out to eat, spent entire days and nights with me, wanted to grab coffee and shop the next mornings. His actions genuinely felt thoughtful and intentional.

He asked me when I was leaving town as I am only here temporarily for work and I told him soon. He said the date was closer than he expected and he does not want to think about it. We agreed that we would enjoy the most of our time together casually hanging out He also talked about wanting to spend as much time as possible with me before I leave town. We had already made plans for our next outing together next week and talker about further plans. But every time I would gently bring up the fact that I’m leaving soon, he would immediately shut it down and ask me not to talk about it anymore. It’s like he didn’t want to face that part.

But here’s where it gets weird.

After our last hangout 4th of July where we got intimate he suddenly panicked. Like, fully flipped a switch. He got up in the middle of everything, apologized over and over, said he needed to leave immediately, and started preaching about how we’re sinning and how he needs to repent. Telling me that he just randomly remember he has an important thing tomorrow and was saying how tomorrow is a special religious holiday he needs to abstain for. 

He also said the fireworks outside were triggering flashbacks from his home country. He was pacing, spiraling, and rushed out so fast it was like he was running from something.

I apologized that he was feeling scared and offered to sit and talk out of a sexual context about how he’s feeling. I apologized for feeling like I was tempting him and asked him directly does he mean no more intimacy moving forward, he hesitates and says yes. I then tell him so I guess I wont hear from you again if you take out the sexual context there is not much holding our “connection” together. He then said we no this was dating to him it was more than sex and if I do not want to talk to him anymore he respects that and does not need me in his life anymore anyways, the world is coming to an end and instead of sinning like this we should be repenting to God. He leaves almost forgets his shirt. 

I ask him if he got home safely, he then casually texted me like nothing had happened. Super light, super polite. No mention of the intense scene. It was honestly bizarre.

I reached out later asking for clarity because it all happened so fast, and he completely ghosted me.

He was the one planning things. He was the one pursuing me. So why would he just freak out and run?

Has anyone experienced something like this? Is this classic avoidant behavior? Or was he just using guilt to ghost me? I’m genuinely trying to understand what happened",1,1751753199.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Not trying to get below 10lbs, but wondering if there are obvious things to cut - or alternatively, add something back in. The items I’m debating about have quantity of zero in Lighterpack. Specifically:

1. Rain jacket vs emergency poncho. Leaning rain jacket but might make a trailhead decision based on forecast.
2. Sawyer Squeeze vs Aquamira. Typically I do the Squeeze but was on a Skurka trip last year and they did all drops. 
3. Sawyer CNOC (or a regular CNOC?) vs Platypus. Just got the Sawyer CNOC with a new filter and damn, it’s awesome. But also 2 oz heavier than the Platypus. :(
4. S2S X-cup vs drinking coffee out of my pot. I might just take this as a luxury item.
5. EB pseudo alpha fleece vs silk sleep shirt. I usually take both but do think the fleece could do double duty. 
6. Probably no on the Houdini windshirt.
7. S2S head net (w insect shield) vs Ben’s head net. Leaning Ben’s for a slight weight savings. As well, shirt, pants, and socks were treated with insect shield.

Note I haven’t weighed my worn weight items but can tomorrow if it’s worthwhile/helpful. As of now I’m still on team hiking boots and not trail runners.

My hobbies include: catch up over coffee with a friend, working out, read something good, or play chill video games to decompress. Borderline tito vibes.

I’m introspective by nature, steady, and playful once there’s comfort. What matters to me is emotional maturity - someone who’s a quiet presence, emotionally intelligent, and open when it counts. Para saken I'm drawn to women who are a balanced mix of emotionally composed pero expressive in their own way. I find it cute and charming.

I value exclusivity and reciprocated effort, especially in the early stages. I don’t mind taking our time, pero syempre I believe 1–2 months is enough to know if we’re headed somewhere real but as long as both sides are showing up.

Truthfully, I’d appreciate someone within a normal BMI range. Physical chemistry matters to me, but so does how we make each other feel day to day.

I'm disappointed in the flying monkeys,"So there's lots of post history for specific details. Essentially MIL is likely mentally ill. She and DH were very emeshed. She ruled us with temper tantrums, silent treatment, guilt trips and passive aggressiveness.

I had a very traumatic birth and postpartum experience with our first baby (now 3 years old). MIL made it worse and was downright mean in some things she said and just insensitive other times. Her defense is she was too happy to be a grandparent and that our LO was big and healthy that she never considered me or how I was doing. She thinks that was completely fine behavior. Her absolute disregard for me postpartum gave me the permission I needed to cut the rope.

We've been NC for 3 years and our lives have been more peaceful. We're honestly happier individually and our marriage is more peaceful. We recently had a new baby 6 months ago. MIL has consistently tried to reestablish contact since we cut contact by calling DH, texting, emailing, dropping off gifts (cake for him on his birthday, presents for LO (multiple occasions)), calling his work line for customers to call in on (he worked IT and his entire team answered that line), threatening to show up at his work, had FIL message twice, told us she was coming and having a visit with LO (our first), tapped a letter to our door, showed up at our house unannounced twice (first time DH ignored second time he answered and they talked-he says the relationship is unhealthy they claim it's not-left him with a childhood photo album). Essentially everything but apologizing or admitted an ounce of fault. Her comments are usually ""let me know if you're willing to start mending fences or picking up the pieces"".

She ""ran into"" one of his friends from high school at his work (seems like it might have been a set up but maybe not) and tried to arrange coffee (friend agreed before knowing, has messaged my we were NC), then she messaged my step Mom saying she was so worried about ""my son and his family"" and hoped my step Mom could answer her. Step Mom is a slight flying monkey and told her that were fine and she would contact MIL if there was an emergency. And step Mom prays for a reconcilation between all of us. 

Now DH's best friend has told him his Mom was messaging him, asking to meet with him and catch with his kids (first time she has asked for this in 11 years). She told DH's best friend she knows about our LO and has seen pictures. I kept the posts (only a few) on a social media account that only had one of DH's cousins on it. I didn't think that cousin really spoke to MIL.

However, she would be the only one capable of sharing a picture (my family knows not too, I don't have any other of DH's family on social media). His other cousin also finds them difficult and wants to stay out of things. I sent her a message and she confirmed she has been speaking to MIL. She stated ""They recently sent me some beautiful things - a portrait of my Mom and I, and the family genealogy book. It's been really to good to be in touch, especially in light of it being 20 years this September since my Mom died."" Cousin reports she is aware the relationship has no contact between us. But I'm assuming that's the leak. I'm disappointed in her. Also I know my view is colored but I think that MIL is a master manipulator and buying cousin off.

I've removed her from social media. But I'm disappointed. I encouraged DH to speak to her more (he wanted to be in contact with family more) and have been sending her our Christmas card and a craft each year. I also tried to set up 3 way video calls with her, my ILs and DH during covid before the NC.

I don't know the point of this post. I'm just a bit betrayed and disappointed in cousin and frustrated MIL is so persistent. ",4,1751752706.0,JUSTNOMIL,2,0.83,False

Hirsutism has taken a toll on my mental health. I started seeing new hair appearing on my neck that were long. I constantly have to pluck out my breast hair and deal with ingrown hairs. I did not feel like a women.

I have white trash neighbours from hell. I’ve had only two conversations with them but it’s incredible how much they’re fucking up my life. I built my dream house on land I bought two years ago, and the house next to it sold to some rather suspect characters during this time. There’s three generations of three people living there, and they’re all so bizarre.

1.) They’ve stolen petty items. Yard tools mostly. For example, I had a very specific blue fibreglass shovel go missing. One from a hardware store that isn’t local here that went out of business years ago. What did I end up seeing in their garage? My blue shovel. 

2.) They get into screaming matches and fist fights all night long. This has kept me up on several occasions. The son also listens to music in the truck, in the driveway at full volume all hours.

3.) Despite everything closing at 8 P.M they start their cat-less truck up hourly until 3-4 A.M. again keeping me up. All night. 

4.) Their dogs have terrorized neighbouring pets. Even disemboweling the other neighbours cat by grabbing it through their catio. They’re also incredibly loud, they never pick up after them and on hot days all I can smell is feces and urine. 

5.) They hoard. Every week it’s truck loads of garbage into the house and truck loads of garbage out. As a result literal garbage ends up on my lawn including used women’s hygiene products. 

6.) Their house is beyond repair. The roof is collapsing in. The garage (separate) is tilted ready to come down; its metal roof is nearly gone, the deck fell down (they threw it in a pile I get to look at from my deck), the house is covered in algae, there is tons and tons of garbage all over the property. Every time they take on a home project they half ass it and make even more mess. For example they cut down a cement wall and threw chunks of cement all over my lawn that I had to meticulously clean up to not ruin my mower. 

7.) They moved my property boundary markers when our house was being built. Trying to claim they own more property. Now I have to have my survey guys come back out and relocate so we can fence this year. They come onto my property all the time as a result and when I asked they didn’t (as it was a hazard to cross while certain parts were being developed) they screamed they owned it. 

8.) They stare and imitate my every move. 
I go outside with my coffee - they come outside with a coffee. 

I cut my grass - they cut their grass. 

I build a deck - they tear their rotting deck down. 

I vacuum - they vacuum. I BBQ - they BBQ. 

And holy do they stare. Every time I’m outside I can feel a hole being burned in the side of my head. Of course when I look over, there they are. Staring.

9.) They beat the shit out of their two dogs.
I watched the mom(?) strangle, punch and kick her large dogs. Several other neighbours have seen this. My BIL has seen it. We called this in. Nothing happened.

Anyway.. that’s all I can remember. The nonsense seems to be really escalating this summer.
None of them work and I’m hoping they default on the mortgage this summer.

I am an international student, so having me costs a lot to my supervisor, which is a ground he uses to taunt me so that he gets all the work he wants. 

My schedule has been merciless, which forced me to work 16 to 20 hours a day every day for the last several months. I am also trying to keep myself afloat by doing side jobs like freelance tutoring, even washing dishes to sustain myself as the salary is criminally low in the university. 

I was forced to take courses that I absolutely hate and have no relevance to the program. Rather, this has become so abusive, I have been producing results as much as possible, practically. I can not rush it. I am trying to explain this to my supervisor, but he has no remorse and understanding.

I have published papers, went to conferences, and have been doing all the chores this guy wants. I am seriously tired of all this nonsense happening with me. I have been desperately trying to get out of this place and get treatment. But my ambitious mind doesn't let me leave this place. It's been just a year now. I've qualified my first year qualifications comprehensive exam. 

Now, I have been diagnosed with a small cancerous cyst in my spine, and I can not speak about it yet to my family or even my friends. My supervisor is a very ""preferentially deafened individual,"" who is only able to hear what he feels is right. I did try to communicate that I am suffering a healthcare nightmare, but he doesn't get it. 

I have been subjected to so many threats for the last few months. I was told last week to present results or withdraw from the program. And gave me a 24-hour ultimatum to produce results. I abused caffeine (hard espresso coffee, etc.), 4 days after my chemo, to stay awake for 24 hours additionally, to make sure that I give him some output. 

Even then, this week, this guy was extremely dissatisfied, as he didn't read my documents, but used other documents to compare and tell me what to do and how it should look. I am thinking in my mind, ""All the fucking content that's there, any professor who had read it would be just giving some constructive feedback or be positive about it. This knucklehead is not even reading mu documents and scolding me because I write 25 pages instead of 20? WTF?""

I have no clue what to do now. I am trying for getting admissions elsewhere, but there is no positivity. I want to strictly bank on my hard work and not sympathy. I have done this all on my own, I have been shot down with 10+ of rejections formally and 300+ rejections and ghosting via email in the last several months. Even from supposedly ""low rank institution"" who are actually really solid in my field. 

I am very clouded, and need some advice. I will delete this post soon, as I am putting myself on edge, if someone understands this me, then I am 100% gonna be fired, as no one around me is supportive in the lab.

But I could have post on decaf because I think I have an addiction with Yerba Mate energy drinks like Guayaki or Mateina, also Guayuasa energy drinks in Canada. The facts is that I had a addiction for coffee two years ago, found the sub Decaf, then stop all coffee and I have began to drink energy drinks with Yerba mate as a subsistute..and now I drink two of them per day, and I begin to feel that they steal my energy , my creativity and my days too..but if I stop the next morning I’ve have one, this day is really hard for myself and then I keep back to the energy drinks to feel better. The only solution for myself to succeed when it’s the next day without it, is to have a coffee. Because only Yerba mate tea doesn’t work like the energy ones, and my day become hard..so I want to convince myself that these energy drinks are not good for me..even if it is Yerba mate, but have to suffer a few days to succeed to drink only the tea leaves, and have a solution of replacement. Because what I would want now is to drink only Yerba mate tea…and I want to succeed. So my question is. Do you find that these energy drinks with Yerba mate are not good? Not as like the tea? They give a instant euphoria that don’t last, and then I have a crash and loose energy..the tea give a long lasting energy, a beautiful happiness. Thank you very much!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **The Great Mariners vs. Pirates Showdown: A Tale of Overhyped Favorites and Desperate Underdogs**

Ah, another night at T-Mobile Park, where the Mariners’ offense is as reliable as a coffee habit—present, but not particularly exciting. The Seattle Mariners (-187) host the Pittsburgh Pirates (+187) in what promises to be a snoozefest of slugging percentages and questionable ERAs. Let’s break this down with the precision of a scout who’s seen *every* swing of Randy Arozarena’s bat.

---

### The Numbers Game

* **Mariners**: 46-42, 11th in MLB in slugging (.408), 1.3 HRs/game. Luis Castillo (4-5, 3.55 ERA) toes the rubber, but his ERA is inflated by a .310 BABIP—meaning his luck might finally turn.
* **Pirates**: 38-51, 29th in slugging (.345), 61 HRs all season. Mike Burrows (1-2, 4.15 ERA) is the starter, and his ERA is… well, it’s not a typo.

**Key Players**:

* **Mariners**: Cal Raleigh (35 HRs, 74 RBI) is a one-man wrecking crew, while Julio Rodriguez’s .307 OBP keeps the lineup afloat.
* **Pirates**: Oneil Cruz (15 HRs) is the lone bright spot in a lineup that’s hitting like a group of interns on their first day.

---

### Odds and Implied Probabilities

* **Mariners**: -187 → **65.1% implied win probability**.
* **Pirates**: +187 → **34.9% implied win probability**.

**Underdog Win Rate (MLB)**: 41%.  
**Split the Difference**: 34.9% (line) vs. 41% (historical underdog rate) → **Expected Value for Pirates**: 41% - 34.9% = **+6.1%**.

---

### Why the Pirates Are a Value Bet

1. **The Mariners Are Overrated Favorites**: Seattle is just 30-56 as a favorite this season (34.9% win rate), far below their implied 65% line. Their “strong” offense? They’ve gone over the total in 47 of 87 games, but that’s more about volume than efficiency.
2. **Burrows vs. Castillo**: Burrows’ 4.15 ERA isn’t great, but Castillo’s 3.55 ERA is buoyed by a .310 BABIP (he’s due for regression). The Pirates’ lineup might not hit, but Castillo’s inconsistency makes this a toss-up.
3. **The Pirates Have Nothing to Lose**: At 38-51, they’re already sellers. Seattle, at 46-42, is a playoff contender—but that pressure could backfire against a punchless Pirates team.

---

### The Over/Under: A Neutral Bet, But Not a Must

* **Total**: 6.5 runs (Over: -115, Under: -115).
* The Mariners average 1.3 HRs/game, and the Pirates hit 0.9 HRs/game. Combined, that’s 2.2 HRs—plus small-ball singles. The Over has gone 47/87 for Seattle, but the line is tight. **Take the Over only if you’re bored and want to gamble**.

---

### Final Verdict

**Best Bet: Pittsburgh Pirates (+187)**

* **Expected Value**: +6.1% (positive EV based on underdog win rate vs. line).
* **Why**: The Mariners are overvalued by the market, and the Pirates’ weak offense isn’t the only story here. Castillo’s shaky command and the Pirates’ desperate need for a win in a dead-rubber game make this a classic “buy low” spot.

**Sarcastic Closing**:  
If you’re betting on the Mariners, you’re not wrong… but you’re also not *right*. It’s like buying a lottery ticket with a 65% chance to win. Congrats, you’re paying for someone else’s dream.

**Stick with the Pirates**. They’re the underdog with a 41% chance to shock the world—and that’s way more fun than watching a team that’s *supposed* to win.

*Play it on FanDuel at +187. Let the Pirates’ bats wake up, and let the Mariners’ ego crumble.* 🐙⚾

She is a very kind and lovely person who is good fun to be around. Ever since my baby was born (her first grandchild) I have felt a strain on our relationship due to her boundary pushing and imposing on me.

My baby is now 5m old. I see my MIL minimum once a week, sometimes twice or three times. She has been so excited about having a grandchild that often I have felt her excitement has taken over her awareness around my feelings.

Several times now she has directed comments about wanting to use ""her pram"", all whilst making these comments speaking to my baby, instead of me. Prior to the birth of my child she went and bought a pram etc for when she would help out. However, I do not feel in a position where I want to hand over my baby for days out just yet but these comments are making me feel really pressured to do so. I find she is quite imposing, asking to collect my baby and take her to a picnic with her work friends so they can all meet her. I feel like she doesn't consider how I am feeling sometimes and is making these requests for her own benefit - rather than mine or my baby's (as she doesn't need to meet a group of people who I haven't even met myself). She will often message unexpectedly or call asking to drop things off and will always stay for a coffee. The other day she was due to come round, my baby's started teething and was very unsettled crying hysterically. I called whilst my baby was crying and said that I needed to just get baby home for a bottle and bed. Her reply was ""I'll only pop by for five mins I need to drop something off"". I explained again and she repeated (in a friendly way) ""oh don't worry I'm only popping by"". This infuriated me as I settle my baby upstairs and would be disruptive (going downstairs and opening doors and getting baby back up from being settled).

I have had issues with my MIL in the past with boundaries (as she doesn't have any) which makes her fun and good company on one hand in some situations but also very intrusive in another.

My partner is very defensive on the subject, so even if I say things in a constructive way, it will often cause a disagreement. We have broached this and he has said he will not be defensive but always is. He feels I'm constantly pushing back on my in laws.

Am I being unreasonable? What can I do? She is a lovely person but has no concept of boundaries whatsoever. I feel I cannot broach this with my partner again.

Also just to add she will be an amazing grandparent to my baby but I just need to know how to manage her as if she could she would FaceTime every night and visit 3 times a week. I love her but sometimes I do need a social battery to be around her.",4,1751750767.0,UKParenting,1,1.0,False

I (29F) have had a very close friend since high school (28 nonbinary, calling them G). This past month, I had a very small wedding to my fiancee of 5 years (29M). By small, I mean we were supposed to have 10 people including the two of us. The ceremony was at a public park and we had a restaurant reservation for after. It was very intimate, and of course we thought a lot about who we wanted there. My very close friend, G, was supposed to come with their new partner. About an hour and a half before the ceremony, G texted me and said that they would be attending the ceremony but not the dinner because they needed some time to process our dynamic because they don't fully understand what is happening with us (almost exact words). They said they felt like there was something unspoken not being said. The message was not hostile, but I still got very upset. I started crying and was very shook up. My fiancee ended up texting them asking them to please just skip the entire thing since he wanted to make sure I had a good time and this seemed like it might ruin the night for me. I told them the next day how confused I was by this and that I needed some time to process. The wedding did end up going really well but it was differently bittersweet without one of my best friends, and with the looming knowledge that one of my best friends seemed to have some kind of issue I didn't understand.

For some context, there had been some distance between me and G the last few months. I have had a lot going on, and so have they. My dog passed away, my mom is getting surgery, and I made the decision to leave a job I had been at for a while which ended up being more emotionally complicated than I expected. G got a divorce, moved in with a new partner, and was struggling with chronic pain and with a job they really don't like. So I had not been the best about texting back. I had also been planning my wedding and finishing the school year (I am a teacher), and just had a lot on my mind. From my end, there hadn't been any bad feelings. I thought we were just aware of the fact that things were really busy - we had even had a conversation a week earlier when I had to cancel on them for coffee about how our schedules seemed to not be lining up that seemed amicable to me. 

Here is the AITAH part. I feel like an AH about this, but I really don't want to hear them out. I know I should give them a chance to explain and not just write off the friendship, but I am having a hard time understanding how someone could do this to a close friend. Like I said, this message completely devastated me and I had a hard time bouncing back and being able to enjoy my wedding. It is always going to be something I remember about this experience. I tried very hard to shake it off but I can't. I feel a ton of guilt about thinking I can probably can't forgive them anytime soon and don't want to be friends again, and even more guilt about throwing away a best friend since high school, but the thought of seeing them makes me start shaking.

First interview with Frida since she left Sweden

 

\-I don't have a big need for new friends, I want to take care of the ones I have, says Frida Lyngstad in the first interview she gives after leaving Sweden for London.

Photo: ROGER LUNDSTEN

Thatcher is a fiery girl!

LONDON. Just over a year ago, Frida Lyngstad moved to London under great attention.

Since then, she has stayed away from the mass media.

Kjell Dabrowski got the first interview for the Swedish press with an open-hearted Frida in London.

\-I feel great, I have to say that this year in London has been very good for me because I have had time to catch up with myself and have had time to think about my life, myself and what I want, she says.

But that Frida would live in London and just sit and twiddle her thumbs is completely wrong. In the past year she has spent, among other things, writing about ten melodies for her new LP, which will be recorded in February and produced by Steve Lillywhite.

\-But since I am so self-critical, we will probably only use one of my own songs.

She has recently been working on the musical ""Abbacadabra"". In France she has made 12 songs for TV and in England she has made a video and sung a single from the musical, which this week is in 61st place.

Why have you stayed away from the mass media? -When I made the decision to move from Sweden, I wanted a period of peace and quiet in my life, so much had happened before and after all these years I deserved to take a little break.

Never in the pub

• When you walk around the streets of London, do people recognize you? Yes, they do, but I am not bothered or harassed in any way.

\- Living in a big city gives you anonymity and here I can choose how I want to spend my time and what I want to do in a completely different way. It was very sensible to move.

Do you take the tube?

\- No, I walk in London. In fact, I sold my car because I don't dare drive left-hand traffic.

What does a normal day look like for you? Do you drink champagne for breakfast? Sure... (laughter) Well, I have my cup of coffee and my sandwich. The same old normal breakfast I've had for many years. I live a quiet life.

Do you go to the pub and have a beer sometimes?

\- I'm not at all fond of beer, so I haven't been to the pub many times.

What do you think of Margaret Thatcher?

She's a fiery girl.

Do you think Swedish journalists are too mean when they do interviews with you? An English newspaper asked Mick Jagger when he last took drugs and how many girls he had slept with since he became a pop star. What would you think of such questions?

 

I am very in love

 

There are different kinds of journalists in all countries, the Swedes are not particularly squeamish.

\-If I were asked such questions, I would say that I don't know anything about it because I have never tried it, at least not the first one. I probably wouldn't answer such questions. It is a lot about integrity.

In a Swedish newspaper you could read that you were very in love with a French businessman.

\-I am very in love, but I don't know if he is French.

Are you not going to get engaged or married? -I don't know, if someone proposes, I might consider saying yes.

If you got engaged, would you advertise it in the press?

\- I wouldn’t.

• Your children are scattered all over the world, your son lives in Sweden and your daughter in the USA.

Family life works quite well, but I miss them a lot. My son, who is 21, lives his own life with his own apartment and my daughter chose to go to an American school instead of living in Sweden. But this is something that happens to all parents, my children are adults.

Do your children like the music you make?

Both Lotta and Hans like my solo album ""Something's going on"", Lotta was also a good advisor when I chose songs.

 

Benny must not disappear

 

What are you going to do for Christmas and New Year? I'm going skiing in the Alps.

Have you changed as a person since you left Sweden?

I have become freer, more open and happier. Because I have had time to think for myself. My life changed a lot when Benny and I broke up and I sold everything I owned in Sweden and moved.

Have you completely gotten over the divorce now?

I have to say that I did, but when you've been with someone for so long, it pops up sometimes. I wouldn't want Benny to disappear from my life or my thoughts. The times he pops up, he's welcome, most of the time it's positive.

Isn't it hard to have contact with someone you've broken up with?

\- The atmosphere might get a little tense because we don't see each other very often. I don't see Benny, Björn or Agnetha very often these days.

• Do you exercise?

\-I don't jog, but I have a bench with lifting devices where I work for an hour every other day.

""Damn how good I have it""

• Are you fascinated by luxury and being financially independent?

No, I'm not fascinated by luxury, but sometimes I think, damn how good I have it.

• Are you afraid of dying? -I'm having so much fun and am so happy with my life that it would be tragic if it happened now. But if it comes naturally, I probably won't be afraid that day.

• Are you worried about the future of the world? What's happening is terrible and worrying. If the unrest in, for example, the Middle East continues, I think there could be a third world war.

Can you do anything as an artist?

\- I don't know what I could do, you have little say in the matter of those in power. Even if you think they're idiots, it's not something you stand in a square and shout about.

Kjell Dabrowski.

1lsk859,https://www.reddit.com/r/airplanes/comments/1lsk859/airports_the_crossroads_of_human_emotion/,Airports: The Crossroads of Human Emotion,"Airports are places where the full spectrum of human emotions is laid bare. They stand as gateways between beginnings and farewells, arrivals and departures, joy and grief. Underneath the metal detectors, flight announcements, and security checks, they serve as theaters for some of the most intense human experiences. If you take a moment to pause and observe, you will find stories unfolding everywhere: reunions that feel like homecoming, goodbyes that ache like open wounds, and moments of solitude where dreams and memories collide.

# The Bittersweet Nature of Farewell

One of the most universal experiences at an airport is saying goodbye. It’s where relationships are put to the test by time and distance, and where people hold onto each other as if the world might fall apart in that final embrace. There’s something heart-wrenching about watching someone you love disappear behind the cold gates of security, knowing that life will move on without them, at least for a while.

Goodbyes at airports are not always dramatic — sometimes they are quiet, loaded with unspoken words. A brief hug, a whispered “stay safe,” or a wave across the departure hall. But no matter how small the gesture, it holds weight. Every farewell carries a mix of sadness, hope, and uncertainty. Will they come back the same? Will life be different when they return? The airport’s sterile corridors amplify these questions, as people cling to fleeting moments, trying to savor what can’t be stopped — time.

# The Magic of Reunions

On the other side of the airport, there are arrivals—an entirely different kind of emotional explosion. Nothing compares to the feeling of waiting by the arrival gate, scanning the crowd for a familiar face. Time seems to freeze in that space between spotting them and embracing them. When loved ones meet after months or even years apart, the world disappears for a brief moment. Tears flow freely, but they are the good kind — the ones that wash away longing and replace it with relief.

There is magic in these reunions, and it is visible in every tight hug, every squeal of joy, every bouquet of flowers exchanged between lovers, parents, and friends. Even strangers feel the energy — the sight of people being reunited reminds us all of the deep human need for connection. It’s a gentle reminder that, no matter how far we travel, love has a way of pulling us back to where we belong.

# The Loneliness in Transit

Airports are also places of solitude. In between the emotional highs and lows, there are moments when travelers sit quietly, lost in thought. It’s easy to feel untethered in transit, as if floating between two lives — the one left behind and the one waiting ahead. Time becomes fluid in the airport; clocks mean little when your heart is still anchored to the place you left, but your body is already moving toward somewhere new.

Some travelers sit alone at gates, staring at their phones or out the window, not because they are bored but because they are processing. For some, the flight might represent the pursuit of a new beginning — a new job, a new city, or the start of a dream. For others, it might carry the weight of loss — flying home for a funeral, saying goodbye to a chapter of life, or walking away from something they thought would last forever.

It’s in these quiet moments — waiting for boarding, sipping coffee at odd hours, watching planes take off into the sky — that people confront their most honest emotions. It’s where anxiety, hope, excitement, and regret intermingle, as if the airport itself is a mirror reflecting every traveler’s inner world.

# The Promise of New Beginnings

Airports are also places of hope. Every flight represents a new adventure, a chance to escape the familiar, and the promise of something different. Honeymooners board planes filled with excitement for the future. Students set off to explore new cities, fueled by dreams and possibilities. Immigrants walk through the gates with hearts full of courage, stepping toward an uncertain but hopeful future.

The airport’s departure board is filled with possibility — Paris, Tokyo, New York, Johannesburg — each destination a promise that life is waiting to be discovered beyond the horizon. Airports remind us that the world is vast and that there are always new places to explore, new people to meet, and new stories to tell.

# A Microcosm of the Human Experience

In many ways, airports are microcosms of life itself. They are places where paths intersect and diverge, where chance encounters turn into lifelong friendships, and where moments of joy are tempered by sadness. The security lines, boarding calls, and crowded terminals may seem mundane, but beneath the surface, there is a hum of life — of emotions raw and unfiltered, of dreams both fulfilled and deferred.

Airports teach us that life is a series of arrivals and departures. People come and go, but the emotions we experience along the way stay with us. They remind us to cherish the hellos because goodbyes are inevitable, to embrace change because standing still is not an option, and to look forward to new beginnings, even when endings feel impossible.

# In Conclusion: The Beauty in the Chaos

Airports are chaotic and stressful, but they are also filled with moments of breathtaking beauty. In a world that often feels disconnected, airports remind us that we are all part of the same human experience. They show us that love transcends distance, that farewells are never really final, and that every journey, no matter how long or short, holds meaning.

So, the next time you find yourself at an airport, take a moment to look around. Witness the reunions, the goodbyes, the quiet reflections, and the hopeful departures. In these moments, you’ll see that airports aren’t just places where planes take off and land—they are places where hearts break and heal, where journeys begin and end, and where human emotion, in all its messy beauty, takes flight.

Seriously. Over any other symptom, the unsolicited advice from others is actually the worst part of being pregnant. For me at least.

At Fourth of July yesterday, I had a family member ask me in front of 20 people “are you planning to give birth naturally?” Like wtf does that even mean? Did you mean vaginally? Or with an Epidural? Why are we discussing my vagina or pain management preferences in front of acquaintances? 🙄 I just said my plan is to have a healthy baby and not die. However this baby decides to exit me, as long as he is healthy, it will be natural…

At work the other day, I was making a cup of coffee (80mg of caffeine, when Dr. said up to 200mg is fine) and a coworker comments “shouldn’t you not be drinking coffee while pregnant?” Excuse me… are you my OBGYN? Please leave me alone and let me enjoy this one simple pleasure that is completely safe according to my highly educated and trained doctor.

Then I went to yoga this morning, which I have been going to 4x a week for years even before pregnancy and have continued to do so (at the advice of my doctor) through my pregnancy..  and another student comments “I’m surprised they let you practice so late, you’re getting so big! Is it safe?” Maybe she was just curious, or trying to make conversation, but cmon why would I be there if it wasn’t safe? Also thank you for pointing out my belly is growing, given it’s attached to me you can imagine I’m well-aware of its size! :))

Just one thing after another… comment after comment. Just existing in the world while being visibly pregnant is like an invitation to others to say some wild shit.

After yoga I decided to go treat myself to the best sushi spot in town. ALONE. And guess what? I got a spicy tuna roll. And it was delicious. I ate it in peace. Feeling content the sushi chef had absolutely nothing to say when I ordered my beautiful fresh caught tuna roll. I have zero regrets. 

Please, random coworkers/family/members of the public, leave us pregnant women alone. You do what works best for you and let other people do what works best for them. Pregnancy is hard enough as it is without the extra judgment from every angle. ",83,1751749770.0,pregnant,22,0.86,False

1lsk5gd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lsk5gd,What was your reason for moving to Mexico?,"Like it says..

What was your reason for moving to Mexico ?
Have you integrated into the local communities ?
How has your life changed for the better ?

So for me I moved here about 5 years ago from Las Vegas when I decided to marry a Mexican woman. She had been in the US as a child for about 10 years and voluntarily returned at age 14. She's fully bilingual with 0 accent at all. We lived in her Infonavit in Reynosa Tamaulipas for about 4 years. Not the safest city if you know anything about it. When we got married in 2021 we bought a house as well. It's in the tiny indigenous village where we were married and her extended family lives. We bought the home from one of her many uncles. The village is dirt roads, no local Internet providers, no restaurants or grocery store and only about 100 ppl max. I love it there. We had a daughter in 2023 and she loves it as well. Lots of green, animals, fresh fruits an vegetable as well as meat. We have several fruit trees in our yard including bananas, plantain, oranges and citrons. There's mango trees everywhere.

I have fully integrated into our village, the surrounding villages and the little cities close by. I used to stick out when we visited on vacation but being half Asian I got dark very fast and my Spanish is way better now. The locals are very weary of outsiders but once they learn who I am I instantly become family as these are small tight knit communities where everyone knows everyone. My wife, even though she has so much family here, is still the oddity along with myself. They don't understand why we chose to move to the village instead of staying in the city or going to the US. Ironically enough a lot of people speak English even if it's not fluent. They speak to me in English and I answer in Spanish unless they ask me to speak English. Most of them were deported many years ago and still know English and enjoy practicing when they have the opportunity which isn't often. I support all local sellers of fruits, vegetables, meats and other locally sourced items like honey, coffee, salsas etc. 

My life in Vegas was work, play poker and drink. I was constantly running and not really happy at all. I didn't know what I wanted. Even after first moving to Mexico I was still running a lot as I crossed into Hidalgo daily for work since I transferred there to be with my wife. It wasn't until I really started taking a step back and seeing things different that my life started to change. The things I took for granted in the US I didn't take for granted here. Having water everyday was a big one. The water would always get cut by comapa in Reynosa with no warning. Yeah we had a tinaco but that runs out fast with 4 people. After visiting rural Veracruz and seeing how some of them lived it really changed my perspective. If you've ever been to a village or rancho then you understand what I'm talking about. I finally found happiness when we moved there. We plan on buying a few hectares, raising animals to sell like cows, pigs and sheep plus some crops. Our 2 year old loves it and we want to give her every possible experience.

Sometimes it takes going to a place you never thought you'd like to find your happiness.
Personally I enjoy being the only American around for miles and miles. I don't want to be surrounded by other Americans that wasn't my reason to move. I go to tourist spots on vacation occasionally but we try to avoid them as much as possible. I never want to be in a bubble of only American people.

Im interested to hear a lot of your stories on why you moved.

Here are some pics of our place.

**📍 BACKGROUND**

Detective Jack Fletcher is a seasoned Las Vegas City Police Department investigator, operating in 1976, who unwittingly becomes a witness to the temporal ripples from the 2244 Chapter 9 climax of 2244 Long Live Las Vegas.  Detective Jack Fletcher came up the hard way.  Known for his bullheaded instinct, brutal honesty, and a growing sense that Vegas has always been stranger than it lets on.

Fletcher doesn't do gadgets. He doesn't do time theory. But on the night of **September 2, 1976**, while on routine surveillance of mobster Tony “Red Tie” Canistrony, he witnessed something no report could fully explain: a warehouse massacre, a man crawling faster than humanly possible, and a freeze-frame distortion of time itself.  He wrote it down anyway. Word for word. Turned it in like it was just another Thursday.

The file was buried. But **the Aeon Council keeps a copy** in their off-grid Black Codex as the *first unknowing mortal witness to chrono-phase manipulation*.

“Warehouse full of bodies, time folded like a paperback… and they want me to say it was heatstroke. Screw that.”

I’m kind of a stickler for food safety. And the first thing I realized was how absolutely unsanitary this practice is. Marker falls on floor, rolls around inside someone’s bag, floats around god knows where, gets put in pocket, gets taken out to write on cup, goes back in pocket, hand that held the marker now places the lid on the cup. Unless we are wiping the marker with a sani wipe and washing hands in between each drink (which we all know is not fucking happening), and/or keeping the marker in a sanitized container between uses, that thing is probably crawling with more bacteria than a toilet seat. 

Granted, back in the day we used to write the drink on the side of the cup but the register partners were the ones doing that, not the bar partners. So not only does it slow things down, it’s also kind of gross.

1lsjzxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1lsjzxy/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

My Honest First Impressions,"Track Your GLP-1 Journey With The [GLP-1 LOG IOS App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/glp-1-log-injections-tracker/id6747810242?platform=iphone)


You know that feeling, right? The one where a new headline pops up, promising something genuinely groundbreaking in an area you care deeply about. Maybe you've been on your own health journey, or perhaps you're just fascinated by the rapid pace of medical innovation. Whatever your reason, if you're like me, ""Retatrutide"" has probably crossed your radar recently, and your mind's started buzzing with questions.

It's easy to get swept up in the initial excitement, but I've found it's super important to pause and really think through what these new developments mean. This isn't a deep dive into the science-y bits - we can save that for another day! Instead, I want to share my honest, unfiltered first impressions and the questions that immediately came to mind when I started hearing more about Retatrutide. Consider this our chat over coffee, where we talk about what's really on our minds.

**The ""Wow"" Factor: What First Caught My Eye**

Let's be real, the initial reports about Retatrutide's potential are pretty eye-popping. When you hear about something that could offer significant benefits, especially in weight management, it naturally grabs your attention. My first reaction was definitely a mix of curiosity and a healthy dose of ""could this really be true?""

Here's what immediately stood out to me:

* **The Numbers:** Honestly, the reported efficacy rates are what first made me sit up straight. We're talking about potential weight loss percentages that are, quite frankly, remarkable when compared to previous options.
* **Novel Mechanism:** It's not just another tweak to an existing approach. Retatrutide works on multiple fronts, targeting different hormonal pathways. This multi-pronged attack felt like a really smart strategy.
* **The Buzz:** You start hearing about it everywhere - in medical journals, news articles, and even casual conversations. That kind of widespread interest usually signals something significant is on the horizon.

It's exciting to imagine the possibilities, especially for folks who've struggled with weight management for years. This is actually pretty cool, isn't it?

**Beyond the Hype: My Immediate Questions and Concerns**

After the initial ""wow,"" my brain quickly shifted into a more analytical mode. As someone who believes in looking at the full picture, I immediately started asking questions that go beyond just the headline figures.

**Safety First, Always**

My biggest immediate concern, like many, was safety. Any powerful new medication comes with potential side effects, and it's crucial to understand them.

* **What are the common side effects?** Are they manageable, or do they significantly impact daily life?
* **Are there any serious, less common risks?** This is something I'd want to know right away.
* **How does it interact with other medications?** So many of us are on daily meds, and compatibility is key.

You might be wondering the same things, and it's totally normal to prioritize your well-being above all else.

**Long-Term Considerations**

It's one thing for a medication to work well in the short term, but what about the long haul? This is a big one for me.

* **Is this a lifelong treatment?** If so, what does that commitment look like?
* **What happens if someone stops taking it?** Do the benefits reverse quickly?
* **Are there any long-term health implications that we don't know about yet?** This is often the case with newer treatments, and it's a valid thing to consider.

**Accessibility and Practicality**

Then there's the practical side of things. Because let's face it, even the most effective medication isn't helpful if it's not accessible.

* **How will this be administered?** Is it an injection, a pill, something else?
* **What's the anticipated cost?** This is a huge factor for many people, myself included.
* **Will it be widely available?** Or will it be restricted to certain conditions or specialists?

These are all important questions that start to paint a more realistic picture of what incorporating something like Retatrutide into one's life might actually entail.

**It's Not Just About the Numbers: The Bigger Picture**

Here's where it gets interesting. While the weight loss numbers are compelling, I quickly realized that thinking about Retatrutide isn't *just* about the scale. It's about a much broader approach to health.

**Lifestyle Matters, Still**

Even with a powerful new tool, our daily habits remain crucial. We've all been there, hoping for a magic bullet, but real, sustainable change often involves more.

* **Dietary Choices:** Will people still need to focus on nutritious eating? (My gut says yes, absolutely!)
* **Physical Activity:** How important will exercise remain alongside this treatment?
* **Mental Well-being:** Weight management isn't just physical; it's deeply tied to our mental health. Will this support overall well-being, or just the physical aspect?

**The Role of Support**

No one's health journey happens in a vacuum. Thinking about Retatrutide made me think about the support system needed around it.

* **Medical Guidance:** It's clear that this isn't something you'd just pick up. Professional medical oversight will be essential.
* **Behavioral Support:** Will patients need coaching or therapy to address underlying habits?
* **Community:** The power of sharing experiences and encouragement can't be overstated.

What's fascinating is how these new medications make us think about health holistically. It's never just one thing, is it?

**Is It Right for *You*? My Current Takeaway**

So, after all these initial impressions and questions, what's my current takeaway? It's pretty straightforward, actually.

Retatrutide represents a truly exciting frontier in weight management and metabolic health. The potential benefits are significant, and it's certainly worth continued attention and research. However, my first impressions strongly reinforce the idea that this, like any powerful medical intervention, is a serious consideration.

Here's what I've learned from my initial thoughts:

1. **Don't Rush In:** It's tempting to jump on the next big thing, but patience and thorough research are your best friends.
2. **Talk to Your Doctor:** This is non-negotiable. Only a healthcare professional can assess if a treatment like Retatrutide is appropriate for your specific health profile and needs.
3. **Consider the Whole Picture:** Think beyond just weight loss. What are the lifestyle changes, the long-term commitment, and the potential impact on your overall well-being?
4. **Manage Expectations:** While promising, no treatment is a miracle cure. It's a tool, and like any tool, its effectiveness depends on how it's used and the context it's used within.

The journey towards better health is a personal one, filled with choices and considerations. Retatrutide is certainly a fascinating new option to think about, but it's just one piece of a much larger, more intricate puzzle. Keep asking questions, keep learning, and always, always prioritize what feels right and safe for *you*.",1,1751749178.0,RetatrutideGuide,0,1.0,False

  THERE WAS DEATH AT ITS BEGINNING AS THERE WOULD BE death again at its end. Though whether it was some fleeting shadow of this that passed across the girl’s dreams and woke her on that least likely of mornings she would never know. All she knew, when she opened her eyes, was that the world was somehow altered.  
  
  The red glow of her alarm showed it was yet a halfhour till the time she had set it to wake her and she lay quite still, not lifting her head, trying to configure the change. It was dark but not as dark as it should be. Across the bedroom, she could clearly make out the dull glint of her riding trophies on cluttered shelves and above them the looming faces of rock stars she had once thought she should care about. She listened. The silence that filled the house was different too, expectant, like the pause between the intake of breath and the uttering of words. Soon there would be the muted roar of the furnace coming alive in the basement and the old farmhouse floorboards would start their ritual creaking complaint. She slipped out from the bedclothes and went to the window.  
  
  There was snow. The first fall of winter. And from the laterals of the fence up by the pond she could tell there must be almost a foot of it. With no deflecting wind, it was perfect and driftless, heaped in comical proportion on the branches of the six small cherry trees her father had planted last year. A single star shone in a wedge of deep blue above the woods. The girl looked down and saw a lace of frost had formed on the lower part of the window and she placed a finger on it, melting a small hole. She shivered, not from the cold, but from the thrill that this transformed world was for the moment entirely hers. And she turned and hurried to get dressed.  
  
  Grace Maclean had come up from New York City the night before with her father, just the two of them. She always enjoyed the trip, two and a half hours on the Taconic State Parkway, cocooned together in the long Mercedes, listening to tapes and chatting easily about school or some new case he was working on. She liked to hear him talk as he drove, liked having him to herself, seeing him slowly unwind in his studiously weekend clothes. Her mother, as usual, had some dinner or function or something and would be catching the train to Hudson this morning, which she preferred to do anyway. The Friday-night crawl of traffic invariably made her crabby and impatient and she would compensate by taking charge, telling Robert, Grace’s father, to slow down or speed up or take some devious route to avoid delays. He never bothered to argue, just did as he was told, though sometimes he would sigh or give Grace, relegated to the backseat, a wry glance in the mirror. Her parents’ relationship had long been a mystery to her, a complicated world where dominance and compliance were never quite what they seemed. Rather than get involved, Grace would simply retreat into the sanctuary of her Walkman.  
  
  On the train her mother would work for the entire journey, undistracted and undistractable. Accompanying her once recently, Grace had watched her and marveled that she never even looked out of the window except perhaps in a glazed, unseeing scan when some big-shot writer or one of her more eager assistant editors called on the cellular phone.  
  
  The light on the landing outside Grace’s room was still on. She tiptoed in her socks past the half-open door of her parents’ bedroom and paused. She could hear the ticking of the wall clock in the hall below and now the reassuring, soft snoring of her father. She came down the stairs into the hall, its azure walls and ceiling already aglow from the r  
eflection of snow through undraped windows. In the kitchen, she drank a glass of milk in one long tilt and ate a chocolate-chip cookie as she scribbled a note for her father on the pad by the phone. Gone riding. Back around 10. Luv, G.  
  
  She took another cookie and ate it on the move as she went through to the passageway by the back door where they left coats and muddy boots. She put on her fleece jacket and hopped elegantly, holding the cookie in her mouth, as she pulled on her riding boots. She zipped her jacket to the neck, put on her gloves and took her riding hat down off the shelf, wondering briefly if she should phone Judith to check if she still wanted to ride now that it had snowed. But there was no need. Judith would be just as excited as she was. As Grace opened the door to step out into the freezing air, she heard the furnace come to life down in the basement.  
  
  Wayne P. Tanner looked gloomily over the rim of his coffee cup at the rows of snowcrusted trucks parked outside the diner. He hated the snow but, more than that, he hated being caught out. And in the space of just a few hours it had happened twice.  
  
  Those New York state troopers had enjoyed every minute of it, smug Yankee bastards. He had seen them slide up behind him and hang there on his tail for a couple of miles, knowing damn well he’d seen them and enjoying it. Then the lights coming on, telling him to pull over and the smartass, no more than a kid, swaggering up alongside in his Stetson like some goddamn movie cop. He’d asked for the daily logbook and Wayne found it, handed it down and watched as the kid read it.  
  
  “Atlanta huh?” he Said, flipping the pages.  
  
  “Yes sir,” Wayne replied. “And it’s one helluva lot warmer down there, I can tell you.” The tone usually worked with cops, respectful but fraternal, implying some working kinship of the road. But the kid didn’t look up.  
  
  “Uh-huh. You know that radar detector you’ve got there is illegal, don’t you?”  
  
  Wayne glanced at the little black box bolted to the dash and wondered for a moment whether to play all innocent. In New York fuzz-busters were only illegal for trucks over eighteen thousand pounds. He was packing about three or four times that. Pleading ignorance, he reckoned, might just make the little bastard meaner still. He turned back with a mock-guilty grin but it was wasted because the kid still didn’t look at him. “Don’t you?” he said again.  
  
  “Yeah, well. I guess.”  
  
  The kid shut the logbook and handed it back up to him, at last meeting his eyes. “Okay,” he said. “Now let’s see the other one.”  
  
  “I’m sorry?”  
  
  “The other logbook. The real one. This one here’s for the fairies.” Something turned over in Wayne’s stomach.  
  
  For fifteen years, like thousands of other truck drivers, he’d kept two logs, one telling the truth about driving times, mileage, rest-overs and all and the other, fabricated specially for situations like this, showing he’d stuck by all the legal limits. And in all that time, pulled over God knows how many dozens of times, coast to coast, never had any cop done this. Shit, damn near every trucker he knew kept a phony log, they called them comic books, it was a joke. If you were on your own and no partner to take shifts, how the hell were you supposed to meet deadlines? How the hell were you supposed to make a goddamn living? Jesus. The companies all knew about it, they just turned a blind eye.  
  
  He had tried spinning it out awhile, playing hurt, even showing a little outrage, but he knew it was no good. The kid’s partner, a big bull-necked guy with a smirk on his face, got out of the patrol car, not wanting to miss out on the fun, and they told him to get down from the cab while they searched it. Seeing they meant to pull the place apart, he decided to come clean, fished the book out from its hiding place under the bunk and gave it to them. It showed he had driven over nine hundred miles in twenty-four hours with only one stop and even that was for only half the eight hours required by law.  
  
  So now he was looking at a thousand-, maybe thirteen-hundred-dollar fine, more if they got him for the goddamn radar detector. He might even lose his commercial driver’s license. The troopers gave him a fistful of paper and escorted him to this truck stop, warning him he’d better not even think of setting out again till morning.  
  
  He waited for them to go, then walked over to the gas station and bought a stale turkey sandwich and a six-pack. He spent the night in the bunk at the back of the cab. It was spacious and comfortable enough and he felt a little better after a couple of beers, but he still spent most of the night worrying. And then he woke up to see the snow and discovered he’d been caught out again.  
  
  In the balm of a Georgia morning two days earlier, Wayne hadn’t thought to check that he had his snow chains. And when he’d looked in the locker this morning, the damn things weren’t there. He couldn’t believe it. Some dumbfuck must have borrowed or stolen them. Wayne knew the interstate would be okay, they’d have had the snowplows and sanders out hours ago. But the two giant turbines he was carrying had to be delivered to a pulp mill in a little place called Chatham and he would have to leave the turnpike and cut across country. The roads would be winding and narrow and probably as yet uncleared. Wayne cursed himself again, finished his coffee and laid down a five-dollar bill.  
  
  Outside the door he stopped to light a cigarette and tugged his Braves baseball cap down hard against the cold. He could hear the drone of trucks already moving out on the interstate. His boots scrunched in the snow as he made his way over the lot toward his truck.  
  
  There were forty or fifty trucks there, lined up side by side, all eighteen-wheelers like his, mainly Peterbilts, Freightliners and Kenworths. Wayne’s was a black and chrome Kenworth Conventional, “anteaters” they called them, because of the long, sloping nose. And though it looked better hitched to a standard highsided, reefer trailer than it did now with the two turbines mounted on a flatbed, in the snowy half-light of dawn, he thought it was still the prettiest truck on the lot. He stood there for a moment admiring it, finishing his cigarette. Unlike the younger drivers who didn’t give a shit nowadays, he always kept his cab gleaming. He had even cleared all the snow off before going in for breakfast. Unlike him though, he suddenly remembered, they probably hadn’t forgotten their goddamn chains. Wayne Tanner squashed his cigarette into the snow and hauled himself up into the cab.  
  
  Two sets of footprints converged at the mouth of the long driveway that led up to the stables. With immaculate timing, the two girls had arrived there only moments apart and made their way up the hill together, their laughter carrying down into the valley. Even though the sun had yet to show, the white picket fence, confining their tracks on either side, looked dowdy against the snow, as did the jumps in the fields beyond. The girls’ tracks curved to the brow of the hill and disappeared into the group of low buildings that huddled, as if for protection, around the vast red barn where the horses were kept.  
  
  As Grace and Judith turned into the stable yard, a cat skittered away from them, spoiling the snow. They stopped and stood there a moment, looking over toward the house. There was no sign of life. Mrs. Dyer, the woman who owned the place and had taught them both to ride, would normally be up and about by now.  
  
  “Do you think we should tell her we’re going out?” Grace whispered.  
  
  The two girls had grown up together, seeing each other at weekends up here in the country for as long as either could remember. Both lived on the Upper West Side, both went to schools on the East Side and both had fathers who were lawyers. But it occurred to neither of them that they should see each other during the week. The friendship belonged here, with their horses. Just turned fourteen, Judith was nearly a year older than Grace and in decisions as weighty as risking the ever-ready wrath of Mrs. Dyer, Grace was happy to defer. Judith sniffed and screwed up her face.  
  
  “Nah,” she said. “She’d only bawl us out for waking her up. Come on.”  
  
  The air inside the barn was warm and heavy with the sweet smell of hay and dung. As the girls came in with their saddles and closed the door, a dozen horses watched from their stalls, ears pricked forward, sensing something differen  
t about the dawn outside just as Grace had. Judith’s horse, a soft-eyed chestnut gelding called Gulliver, whinnied as she came up to the stall, putting his face forward for her to rub.  
  
  “Hi baby,” she said. “How are you today, huh?” The horse backed off gently from the gate so Judith would have room to come in with the tack.  
  
  Grace walked on. Her horse was in the last stall at the far end of the barn. Grace spoke softly to the others as she passed them, greeting them by name. She could see Pilgrim, his head erect and still, watching her all the way. He was a four-year-old Morgan, a gelding of a bay so dark that in some lights he looked black. Her parents had bought him for her last summer for her birthday, reluctantly. They had worried he was too big and too young for her, altogether too much of a horse. For Grace, it was love at first sight.  
  
  They had flown down to Kentucky to see him and when they were taken out to the field, he came right over to the fence to check her out. He didn’t let her touch him, just sniffed her hand, brushing it lightly with his whiskers. Then he tossed his head like some haughty prince and ran off, flagging his long tail, his coat glistening in the sun like polished ebony.  
  
  The woman who was selling him let Grace ride him and it was only then that her parents gave each other a look and she knew they would let her have him. Her mother hadn’t ridden since she was a child but she could be counted on to recognize class when she saw it. And Pilgrim was class alright. There was no doubting he was also a handful and quite different from any other horse she had ridden. But when Grace was on him and could feel all that life pounding away inside him, she knew that in his heart he was good and not mean and that they would be okay together. They would be a team. She had wanted to change his name to something prouder, like Cochise or Khan, but her mother, ever the tyrant liberal, said it was up to Grace of course, but in her opinion it was bad luck to change a horse’s name. So Pilgrim he remained.  
  
  “Hey, gorgeous,” she said as she reached the stall. “Who’s my man?” She reached out for him and he let her touch the velvet of his muzzle, but only briefly, tilting his head up and away from her. “You are such a flirt. Come on, let’s get you fixed here.”  
  
  Grace let herself into the stall and took off the horse’s blanket. When she swung the saddle over him, he shifted away a little as he always did and she told him firmly to keep still. She told him about the surprise he had waiting for him outside as she lightly fastened the girth and put on the bridle. Then she took a hoof pick from her pocket and methodically cleared the dirt from each of his feet. She could hear Judith already leading Gulliver out of his stall, so she hurried to tighten the girth and now they too were ready.  
  
  They led the horses out into the yard and let them stand there a few moments appraising the snow while Judith went back to shut the barn door. Gulliver lowered his head and sniffed, concluding quickly it was the same stuff he had seen a hundred times before. Pilgrim however was amazed. He pawed it and was startled when it moved. He tried sniffing it, as he had seen the older horse do. But he sniffed too hard and gave a great sneeze that had the girls rocking with laughter.  
  
  “Maybe he’s never seen it before,” said Judith.  
  
  “He must have. Don’t they have snow in Kentucky?”  
  
  “I don’t know. I guess so.” She looked across at Mrs. Dyer’s house. “Hey, come on, let’s go or we’ll wake the dragon.”  
  
  They led the horses out of the yard and into the top meadow and there they mounted up and rode in a slow, climbing traverse toward the gate that led into the woods. Their tracks cut a perfect diagonal across the unblemished square of the field. And as they reached the woods, at last the sun came up over the ridge and filled the valley behind them with tilted shadows.  
  
  One of the things Grace’s mother hated most about weekends was the mountain of newsprint she had to read. It accumulated all week like some malign volcanic mass. Each day, recklessly, she stacked it higher with the weeklies and all those sections of The New York Times she didn’t dare trash. By Saturday it had become too menacing to ignore and with several more tons of Sunday’s New York Times horribly imminent, she knew that if she didn’t act now, she would be swept away and buried. All those words, let loose on the world. All that effort. Just to make you feel guilty. Annie tossed another slab to the floor and wearily picked up the New York Post.  
  
  The Macleans’ apartment was on the eighth floor of an elegant old building on Central Park West. Annie sat with her feet tucked up on the yellow sofa by the window. She was wearing black leggings and a light gray sweatshirt. Her bobbed auburn hair, tied in a stubby ponytail, was set aflame by the sun that streamed in behind her and made a shadow of her on the matching sofa across the living room.  
  
  The room was long and painted a pale yellow. It was lined at one end with books and there were pieces of African art and a grand piano, one gleaming end of which was now caught by the angling sun. If Annie had turned she would have seen seagulls strutting on the ice of the reservoir. Even in the snow, even this early on a Saturday morning, there were joggers out, pounding the circuit that she herself would be pounding as soon as she had finished the papers. She took a sip from her mug of tea and was about to junk the Post when she spotted a small item hidden away in a column she usually skipped.  
  
  “I don’t believe it,” she said aloud. “You little rat.”  
  
  She clunked the mug down on the table and went briskly to get the phone from the hallway. She came back already punching the number and stood facing the window now, tapping a foot while she waited for an answer. Below the reservoir an old man wearing skis and an absurdly large radio headset was tramping ferociously toward the trees. A woman was scolding a leashed gaggle of tiny dogs, all with matching knitted coats and with legs so short they had to leap and sledge to make progress.  
  
  “Anthony? Did you see the Post?” Annie had obviously woken her young assistant but it didn’t occur to her to apologize. “They’ve got a piece about me and Fiske. The little shit’s saying I fired him and that I faked the new circulation figures.”  
  
  Anthony said something sympathetic but it wasn’t sympathy Annie was after. “Do you have Don Farlow’s weekend number?” He went to get it. Out in the park, the dog woman had given up and was now dragging them back toward the street. Anthony returned with the number and Annie jotted it down.  
  
  “Good,” she said. “Go back to sleep.” She hung up and immediately dialed Farlow’s number.  
  
  Don Farlow was the publishing group’s stormtrooper lawyer. In the six months since Annie Graves (professionally she had always used her maiden name) was brought in as editor-in-chief to salvage its sinking flagship magazine, he had become an ally and almost a friend. Together they had set about the ousting of the Old Guard. Blood had flowed—new blood in and old blood out—and the press had relished every drop. Among those to whom she and Farlow had shown the door were several well-connected writers who had promptly taken their revenge in the gossip columns. The place became known as the Graves Yard.  
  
  Annie could understand their bitterness. Some had been there so many years, they felt they owned the place. To be uprooted at all was demeaning enough. To be uprooted by an upstart forty-three-year-old woman, and English to boot, was intolerable. The purge was now almost over, however, and Annie and Farlow had recently become skillful at constructing payoff deals which bought the silence of those departing. She thought they had done just that with Fenimore Fiske, the magazine’s aging and insufferable movie critic who was now badmouthing her in the Post. The rat. But as Annie waited for Farlow to answer the phone, she took comfort from the fact that Fiske had made a big mistake in calling her increased circulation figures a sham. They weren’t and she could prove it.  
  
  Farlow was not only up, he had seen the Post piece too. They agreed to meet in two hours’ time in her office. They would sue the old bastard for every penny they’d bought him off with.  
  
  Annie called her husband in Chatham and got her own voice on the answering machine. She left a message telling Robert it was time he was up, that she would be catching the later train and not to go to the supermarket before she got there. Then she took the elevator down and went out into the snow to join the joggers. Except, of course, Annie Graves didn’t jog. She ran. And although this distinction was not immediately obvious from either her speed or her technique, to Annie it was as clear and vital as the cold morning air into which she now plunged.  
  
  The interstate was fine, as Wayne Tanner had expected. There wasn’t too much else on the road what with it being a Saturday and he reckoned he’d be better keeping on up 87 till it hit 90, cross the Hudson River there and head on down to Chatham from the north. He’d studied the map and figured that though it wasn’t the most direct route, less of it would be on smaller roads that might not have been cleared. With no chains, he only hoped this access road to the mill they’d told him about wasn’t just some dirt track or something.  
  
  By the time he picked up the signs for 90 and swung east, he was starting to feel better. The countryside looked like a Christmas card and with Garth Brooks on the tape machine and the sun bouncing off the Kenworth’s mighty nose, things didn’t seem so bad as they had last night. Hell, if it came to the worst and he lost his license, he could always go back and be a mechanic like he was trained to be. It wouldn’t be so much money, for sure. It was a goddamn insult how little they paid a guy who’d done years of training and had to buy himself ten thousand dollars’ worth of tools. But sometimes lately he’d been getting tired of being on the road so much. Maybe it would be nice to spend more time at home with his wife and kids. Well, maybe. Spend more time fishing, anyway.  
  
  With a jolt, Wayne spotted the exit for Chatham coming up and he g  
ot to work, pumping the brakes and taking the truck down through its nine gears, making the big four-twenty-five horsepower Cummins engine roar in complaint. As he forked away from the interstate he flipped the four-wheel-drive switch, locking in the cab’s front axle. From here, he calculated, it was maybe just five or six miles to the mill.  
  
  High in the woods that morning there was a stillness, as if life itself had been suspended. Neither bird nor animal spoke and the only sound was the sporadic soft thud of snow from overladen boughs. Up into this waiting vacuum, through maple and birch, rose the distant laughter of the girls.  
  
  They were making their way slowly up the winding trail that led to the ridge, letting the horses choose the pace. Judith was in front and she was twisted around, propped with one hand on the cantle of Gulliver’s saddle, looking back at Pilgrim and laughing.  
  
  “You should put him in a circus,” she said. “The guy’s a natural clown.”  
  
  Grace was laughing too much to reply. Pilgrim was walking with his head down, pushing his nose through the snow like a shovel. Then he would toss a load of it into the air with a sneeze and break into a little trot, pretending to be frightened of it as it scattered.  
  
  “Hey, come on now you, that’s enough,” said Grace, reining him in, getting control. Pilgrim settled back into a walk and Judith, still grinning, shook her head and turned to face the trail again. Gulliver walked on, thoroughly unconcerned by the antics behind him, his head moving up and down to the rhythm of his feet. Along the trail, every twenty yards or so, bright orange posters were pinned to the trees, threatening prosecution for anyone caught hunting, trapping or trespassing.  
  
  At the crest of the ridge that separated the two valleys was a small, circular clearing where normally, if they approached quietly, they might find deer or wild turkey. Today however, when the girls rode out from the trees and into the sun, all they found was the bloody, severed wing of a bird. It lay almost exactly in the middle of the clearing like the mark of some savage compass and the girls stopped there and looked down at it.  
  
  “What is it, a pheasant or something?” said Grace.  
  
  “I guess. A former pheasant anyway. Part of a former pheasant.”  
  
  Grace frowned. “How did it get here?”  
  
  “I don’t know. A fox maybe.”  
  
  “It couldn’t be, where are the tracks?”  
  
  There weren’t any. Nor was there any sign of a struggle. It was as if the wing had flown there on its own. Judith shrugged.  
  
  “Maybe somebody shot it.”  
  
  “What, and the rest of it flew on with one wing?”  
  
  They both pondered a moment. Then Judith nodded sagely. “A hawk. Dropped by a passing hawk.”  
  
  Grace thought it over. “A hawk. Uh-huh. I’ll buy that.” They nudged the horses into a walk again.  
  
  “Or a passing airplane.”  
  
  Grace laughed. “That’s it,” she said. “It looks like the chicken they served on that flight to London last year. Only better.”  
  
  Usually when they rode up here to the ridge they would give the horses a canter across the clearing and then loop back down to the stables by another trail. But the snow and the sun and the clear morning sky made both girls want more than that today. They decided to do something they had done only once before, a couple of years ago, when Grace still had Gypsy, her stocky little palomino pony. They would cross over into the next valley, cut down through the woods and come back around the hill the long way, beside Kinderhook Creek. It meant crossing a road or two, but Pilgrim seemed to have settled down and anyway, this early on a snowy Saturday morning, there would be nothing much about.  
  
  As they left the clearing and passed again into the shade of the woods, Grace and Judith fell silent. There were hickories and poplars on this side of the ridge with no obvious trail among them and the girls had frequently to lower their heads to pass beneath the branches so that soon they and the horses were covered with a fine sprinkling of dislodged snow. They negotiated their way slowly down beside a stream. Crusts of ice overhung it, spreading jaggedly from the banks and allowing but a glimpse of the water that rushed darkly beneath. The slope grew ever steeper and the horses now moved with caution, taking care where they placed their feet. Once Gulliver slipped lurchingly on a hidden rock, but he righted himself without panic. The sun slanting down through the trees made crazed patterns on the snow and lit the clouds of breath billowing from the horses’ nostrils. But neither girl paid heed, for they were concentrating too hard on the descent and their heads were filled only with the feel of the animals they rode.  
  
  It was with relief that at last they saw the glint of Kinderhook Creek below them through the trees. The descent had been more difficult than either girl had expected and only now did they feel able to look at each other and grin.  
  
  “Nice one, huh?” Judith said, gently bringing Gulliver to a stop. Grace laughed.  
  
  “No problem.” She leaned forward and rubbed Pilgrim’s neck. “Didn’t these guys do well?”  
  
  “They did great.”  
  
  “I don’t remember it being steep like that.”  
  
  “It wasn’t. I think we followed a different stream. I figure we’re about a mile farther south than we should be.”  
  
  They brushed the snow from their clothes and hats and peered down through the trees. Below the woods a meadow of virgin white sloped gently down to the river. Along the near side of the river they could just make out the fence posts of the old road that led to the pulp mill. It was a road no longer used since a wider, more direct access had been built from the highway which lay half a mile away on the other side of the river. The girls would have to follow the old mill road north to pick up the route they had planned to get home.  
  
  Just as he’d feared, the road down to Chatham hadn’t been cleared. But Wayne Tanner soon realized he needn’t have worried. Others had been out before him and the Kenworth’s eighteen heavy-duty tires cut into their tracks and grabbed the surface firmly. He hadn’t needed the damn chains after all. He passed a snowplow coming the other way and even though that wasn’t a whole lot of use to him, such was his relief that he gave the guy a wave and a friendly blast on the horn.  
  
  He lit a cigarette and looked at his watch. He was earlier than he’d said he would be. After his run-in with the cops, he’d called Atlanta and told them to fix things with the mill people for him to deliver the turbines in the morning. Nobody liked working on a Saturday and he guessed he wasn’t going to be too popular when he got there. Still, that was their problem. He shoved in another Garth Brooks tape and started looking out for the entrance to the mill.  
  
  The old mill road was easy going after the woods and the girls and their horses relaxed as they made their way along it, side by side in the sunshine. Away to their left, a pair of blue jays chased each other in the trees fringing the river and through their shrill chatter and the rustle of water on rock, Grace could hear what she assumed was a snowplow out clearing the highway.  
  
  “Here we go.” Judith nodded up ahead.  
  
  It was the place they had been looking for, where once a railroad had crossed first the mill road and then the river. It was many years since the railroad had closed and though the river bridge remained intact, the top of the bridge across the road had been removed. All that remained were its tall concrete sides, a roofless tunnel through which the road now passed before disappearing in a bend. Just before it was a steep path that led up the embankment to the level of the railroad and it was up here that the girls needed to go to get onto the river bridge.  
  
  Judith went first, steering Gulliver up the path. He took a few steps then stopped.  
  
  “Come on boy, it’s okay.”  
  
  The horse gently pawed the snow, as if testing it. Judith urged him on with her heels now.  
  
  “Come on lazybones, up we go.”  
  
  Gulliver relented and moved on again up the path. Grace waited down in the road, watching. She was vaguely aware that the sound of the snowplow out on the highway seemed louder. Pilgrim’s ears twitched. She reached down and pat  
ted his sweaty neck.  
  
  “How is it?” she called up to Judith.  
  
  “It’s okay. Take it gently though.”  
  
  It happened just as Gulliver was almost at the top of the embankment. Grace had started up behind him, following his tracks as precisely as she could, letting Pilgrim take his time. She was halfway up when she heard the rasp of Gulliver’s shoe on ice and Judith’s frightened cry.  
  
  Had the girls ridden here more recently, they would have known that the slope they were climbing had, since late summer, run with water from a leaking culvert. The blanket of snow now concealed a sheet of sheer ice.  
  
  Gulliver staggered, trying to find purchase with his hind feet, kicking up a spray of snow and ice shards. But as each foot failed to hold, his rear end swung down and across the slope so that he was now squarely on the ice. One of his forelegs skewed sideways and he went down on one knee, still sliding. Judith cried out as she was flung forward and lost a stirrup. But she managed to grab the horse’s neck and stayed on, yelling down at Grace now.  
  
  “Get out of the way! Grace!”  
  
  Grace was transfixed. There was a roar of blood in her head that seemed to freeze and separate her from what she was watching above her. But upon Judith’s second cry she reconnected and tried to turn Pilgrim down the slope. The horse yanked his head, frightened, fighting her. He took several small sideways steps, twisting his neck up the slope until his feet too skidded and he nickered in alarm. They were now directly in the path of Gulliver’s slide. Grace screamed and wrenched the reins.  
  
  “Pilgrim, come on! Move!”  
  
  In the odd stillness of the moment before Gulliver hit them, Grace knew there was more to the roar in her head than the rushing of blood. That snowplow wasn’t out on the highway., It was too loud for that. It was somewhere nearer. The thought was vaporized by the shuddering impact of Gulliver’s hindquarters. He bulldozed into them, hitting Pilgrim’s shoulder and spinning him around. Grace felt herself being lifted out of the saddle, whiplashed up the slope. And had one hand not found the rump of the other horse she would have fallen then as Judith fell. But she stayed on, wrapping a fist into Pilgrim’s silky mane as he slid down the slope beneath her.

In the past few months, I've released and continuously updated a news aggregator app called [Newsreadeck](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/newsreadeck/id1593025917). I enjoy starting my day with coffee and news from various sources, but most similar apps are focused on English and cater primarily to U.S. users.

Initially, I tried using RSS feeds, but many websites don't provide them, and manually creating or finding these feeds was tedious. Additionally, most news apps restrict article access, bombarding users with ads, suggested articles, and irrelevant information.

To tackle these issues, I developed my own data sources. I've compiled over 16,000 curated sources, categorized by language, location, and topic, which I monitor for reliability. The app lets you discover and follow sources without limits, providing seamless access to articles. I also built a custom reader to remove ads, banners, and distractions, though some paywalls may still appear.

Following multiple sources can lead to unwanted articles. With the app, you can mute words, mute sources, or create a custom reading list by grouping channels, keeping your news feed clean and relevant.

If you want to stay informed and save time by avoiding distractions,[ feel free to download the app from the App Store.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/newsreadeck/id1593025917) :)

The prices are gone sky high - and many of the businesses have moved out or not returned since covied.  LCBO - Pharma Plus - Post Office - Bloor St. Diner - Timothys Coffee Shop - Starbucks - are no longer here. There is a new coffee shop now open only until 4 p.m. - Dark Horse just opened in Indigo - LL Bean is opening in the fall (but it is american and we wont shop there ever) very few stores remain nothing exciting. Earls restaurant is opened now but very high end expensive and very very very noisy - we refuse to go.  Eataly reataurants are overpriced - and poor service - loud - noisy and chaotic.  Indigo sells more junky items than books .If your interested in moving in the bldg. they are NOT CONDOS AS many people think they are apts.  they are under rent control but very high priced for what you are getting in this area.  There many downfalls of moving in here - you must speak to people who live here or neighbours on various floors - as the leasing management and others dont tell you the truth at all.  A three bedroom will put you back 9000.00 plus parking $230.00 plus cost of a locker - hydro - and Rogers Cable.  For 9000.00 you can do quite well in a more modern bldg.  in the area - Manulife has lots of issues - most units have no washers dryers at all... only the 3 bedrooms and some large corner units.  Installation of washers and dryers is extra an would cost you in the area of 15 to 20 thousand dollars. The new renvations of over 100 units are done very cheaply - poor workmanship - done with low great appliances and flooring. For a 2 bedroom depends on what floor you want and view North or South - they run in the high rise in the area of between 5500.00 to 6700.00 plus the amenities listed above.  The hallways were redone recently and have many many flaws - and poor workmanship.  The bldg. is now 53 years old - always having flooding - the laundry rooms (2 one for the low rise and one for high rise) are disgustingly dirty - and always breaking down and not cleaned properly - The outside of the bldg. has been done over as you may notice and it is a bloody mess many errors made in construction. Recently the finally after over 2 years opened the front entrance and have put in plants trees etc.  The plants were cheap and ugly - and they forgot to connect the water lines to the gardens and all the plants probably thousands of dollars worth have just rotted and dead.  The front entrance where you get out of taxis - cars - wheel trans etc. is often congested - and dirty - dogs pee all over the front - and it is not cleaned up properly. Maintenance staff seem to not care nor are the apparently not told to keep the front entrance with new signage which bye the way now says in large letters (CHARLES WEST) they refuse to put the #44 on it - and it confuses taxis - uber - lyft drivers and people visiting.  No comments from Management. Manulife management is now taken over by JLL and American Company and they dont seem to be keeping things in order - they have changed so many things here we are confused.  They hardly ever answer your requests or complaints.  The Gym is way out of date and has a couple of machines no working for the last year or tow.  Billiards room - is dirty - has coutches very old stained and the carpeting is digusting.  The Party room has not been upgraded in many many years. The furniture in it is stained - dirty - tables scratched ugly - needs painting and some tender care.  The Library on the 51st floor is a lovely room which also needs an upgrade had a lovely view and grand piano - and shelves of books to read - and there is a swimming pool on the 51st floor as well, along with showers and sauna. The cineplex theatre is still nice and convenient for us all - however not sure how long they will be running due to financial losses lately.  The bottom line is that on Charles St. @ Bloor st. there will be more construction of a 91 floor condo going up - making more construction in our areas and changing traffic congestion.  The area of Bloor/Yonge has lost many stores also - The Gap - Talbots - The Bay - Nordstrom Rack - Mcewans - to name a few.  The new condo at Bloor/Yonge has been under construction for about 5 years a 85 storey Hotel - condo - Commerical high rise and has been in receivership 3 times now.  It is due to open only in 2027 - 2028.  So it is very congested -dirty - noisy -dusty - and not a nice place to walk around anymore.  Yonge st. from Davenport Rd. southward to Queen st. is under construction - and has many bldgs. boarded up - few restaurants other than small places that are not so nice - there are no more clubs - or decent restaurants in that 10 - 12 block area.  It is and will be under construction for a number of years to come.  It may be convenient in some ways as the subway is connected underground from Manulife but that connection is underconstruction for a new subway stations - and other issues.  That could be ongoing for 3 - 5 years.  Many of us here in Manulife will not every see them.  Yorkville Village is high end and very close by and accessbile and lovely but you are talking 3 - 5 - 10 million for a condo and high end shopping much like Rodeo Drive in L.A. We have lived here for 15 years after selling our condo - in downtown Toronto - we certainly would not be paying 6600.00 for our two bedroom today if we made a decision - we would be going somewhere else in the area.  This has no feeling of modern - renovations very poorly planned - and whoever the architect was must not known what they were doing... there is more to come here since the Main Lobby also will be renovated and closed of for a period of time.  I has been at least 8 - 9 years of chaos - elevators broken down - unable to get parts etc. and so much more. If you want to know more ask me on here my name is simply FRANCO.  I have lived here in Toronto for 85 years and was born downtown in the general area.

I just understand that there are two options, either the coffee is well-brewed, but I won’t feel the whole spectrum of flavors because of the milk, or the coffee is bad, but it will taste okay-ish because of the milk (still have to pay the full price tho, I would prefer to drink it at home rather then drinking it at coffee shops).

There are some days when I don't nap and I get the wobbly feeling in my legs if I am very active (work, walk dog, etc). Does this sound normal at the four month mark or is it CFS?

1lsjfiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1lsjfiy/how_do_you_make_cold_foam_for_coffee/,How do you make cold foam for coffee?,"As a coffee lover, I've always enjoyed experimenting with different ways to make my daily brew more exciting. Recently, I've been obsessed with cold foam - that creamy, velvety topping that adds a luxurious touch to iced coffee. If you're curious about how to make cold foam at home, you're in luck! I'm going to share my favorite methods and tips.

First things first, you'll need a few basic tools. A milk frother is the easiest way to create cold foam, but don't worry if you don't have one. You can also use a blender, a French press, or even a jar with a tight-fitting lid.

Let's start with the simplest method: the jar technique. Pour some cold milk (about 1/4 cup) into a jar, seal it tightly, and shake vigorously for about 30 seconds. The milk will become frothy and double in volume. For best results, use nonfat or low-fat milk - they foam up better than whole milk.

If you have a handheld milk frother, that's even better. Just pour your cold milk into a cup, submerge the frother, and whip it up for about 20-30 seconds until you get the desired consistency.

For those with a French press, fill it about 1/3 full with cold milk. Pump the plunger up and down rapidly for about 30 seconds. The result? Perfect cold foam!

Now, if you want to take your cold foam game to the next level, consider investing in a dedicated iced coffee maker. These often come with built-in milk frothers, making the whole process a breeze. I found some great options at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers - they have a wide range of iced coffee makers to suit different needs and budgets.

Once you've mastered the basic cold foam, you can start experimenting with flavors. Try adding a dash of vanilla extract, a sprinkle of cinnamon, or even a squeeze of caramel syrup to your milk before frothing. The possibilities are endless!

Remember, the key to great cold foam is using very cold milk and frothing it just before you're ready to use it. If you let it sit too long, it'll start to deflate.

One of my favorite ways to use cold foam is on top of a classic iced latte. Brew your espresso, pour it over ice, add your milk, and top it off with a generous dollop of cold foam. It's like having a coffee shop experience right at home!

If you're as excited about iced coffee as I am, you might want to check out some of the iced coffee makers available at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers. They've got some great options that can help you create barista-quality drinks at home.

Making cold foam for coffee is a simple way to elevate your iced coffee game. Whether you're using a jar, a frother, or a fancy iced coffee maker, you can create delicious, creamy cold foam in no time. So go ahead, give it a try, and enjoy your coffee shop-worthy drinks from the comfort of your own home!",1,1751747713.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

1lsje9k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lsje9k,"I built an AI automation that scrapes my competitor's product reviews and social media comments (analyzed over 500,000 data points last week)","I've been a marketer for last 5 years, and for over an year I used to spend 9+ hrs/wk manually creating a report on my competitors and their SKUs. I had to scroll through hundreds of Amazon reviews and Instagram comments. It's slow, tedious, and you always miss things.

AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude can't do this, they hit a wall on protected pages. So, I built a fully automated system using n8n that can.

This agent can:

* Scrape reviews for any Amazon product and give a summarised version or complete text of the reviews.
* Analyse the comments on Instagram post to gauge sentiment.
* Track pricing data, scrape regional news, and a lot more.

This system now tracks over 500,000 data points across amazon pages and social accounts for my company, and it helped us improve our messaging on ad pages and amazon listings.

**The stack:**

* **Agent:** Self-hosted n8n instance on Render (I literally found the easiest way to set this up, I have covered it in the video below)
* **Scraping:** Bright Data's Web Unlocker API, which handles proxies, and CAPTCHAs. I connected it via a Smithery MCP server, which makes it dead simple to use.
* **AI Brain:** OpenAI GPT-4o mini, to understand requests and summarize the scraped data.
* **Data Storage:** A free Supabase project to store all the outputs.

As I mentioned before, I'm a marketer (turned founder) so all of it is built without writing any code

📺 **I created a video tutorial that shows you exactly how to build this from scratch**

It covers everything from setting up the self-hosted n8n instance to connecting the Bright Data API and saving the data in Supabase

**Watch the full video here:** [**https://youtu.be/oAXmE0\_rxSk**](https://youtu.be/oAXmE0_rxSk)

\-----

Here are all the key steps in the process:  
  
**Step 1: Host n8n on Render**

* **Fork Render’s n8n blueprint** → [https://render.com/docs/deploy-n8n](https://render.com/docs/deploy-n8n)
* In Render → **Blueprints ▸ New Blueprint Instance ▸ Connect** the repo you just created.

  
**Step 2: Install the MCP community node**

* Link to the community node -> [https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-mcp?utm\_source=chatgpt.co](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[m](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  
**Step 3: Create the Brightdata account**

* Visit BrightData and sign up, use this link for $10 FREE credit -> [https://brightdata.com/?promo=nimish](https://brightdata.com/?promo=nimish)
* **My Zones ▸ Add ▸ Web Unlocker API**
   * Zone name `mcp_unlocker` (exact string).
   * Toggle **CAPTCHA solver ON**

  
**Step 4: Setup the MCP server on Smithery**

* Visit the BrightData MCP page on Smithery -> [https://smithery.ai/server/%40luminati-io/brightdata-mcp](https://smithery.ai/server/%40luminati-io/brightdata-mcp)



**Step 5: Create the workflow in n8n**

* System message for agent and MCP tool -> [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TZoBxwOxcF1dcMrL7Q-G0ROsE5bu8P7dNy8Up57cUgY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TZoBxwOxcF1dcMrL7Q-G0ROsE5bu8P7dNy8Up57cUgY/edit?usp=sharing)



**Step 6: Make a project on Supabase**

* Setup a free account on [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/)



**Step 7: Connect the Supabase project to the workflow**

* Connect your Supabase project to the ai agent
* Back in Supabase **Table Editor**, create `scraping_data` with columns:
   * `id` (UUID, PK, default = `uuid_generate_v4()`)
   * `created_at` (timestamp, default = `now()`)
   * `output` (text)
* Map the **output** field from the AI agent into the `output` column.



**Step 8: Build further**

* **Webhook trigger:** Swap `On Chat Message` for `Webhook` to call the agent from any app or Lovable/Bolt front-end.
* **Cron jobs:** Add a **Schedule** node (e.g., daily at 05:00) to track prices, follower counts, or news.

1. ~~Even though Alex gets audibly upset about the oyster fridge being unplugged, she somehow does not mention a thing about it to Charlie the next time they meet up at the bar and Alex is having champagne. Instead, Alex mentions the guy who she claimed hit on her (something we never see), leaving Charlie to discover the discarded oysters in the trash and wonder what happened.~~  Edit: Never mind, my mistake.
2. Alex is the one who suggests escaping the Feds via boat, and when she and Charlie go to the boathouse, she doesn’t even seem to look around before going straight to untie the canoe, as if she already knew where it was and how to get it down. And inside the canoe, there’s the hat and fake eye that the assassin wore, for Charlie to find. But when Charlie corrects her that it’s a lens worn by the assassin disguised as Todd and not an actual fake eye, she dismisses it as “too elaborate.”
3. Are we sure that what Charlie assumes is Beatrix’s Finsta is really Beatrix’s Finsta? How did Bea even tell her about it? Charlie pointed out that she couldn’t DM her. So how did Bea tell her about the account in the first place? One thing that stood out to me in the picture with the mail is the coffee next to the pie. It has a fancy leaf design on the foam, like they do in coffee shops. Maybe Beatrix knows how to make fancy foam designs. That aside, it just seems odd that someone in witness protection would be so careless as to post a pic with their mail in such a prominent position.

My theory is that>! 2. suggests Alex is the employer of the assassin/Iguana/Good Buddy and a part of the Five Families and was luring him to choose her as the patsy, while he thought he was luring her. She also knew that Charlie would later believe that she didn’t kill Kirby, because technically she didn’t, and could then manipulate her into taking her to Beatrix. When Alex said Charlie’s idea of a killer in disguise was “too elaborate,” she seemed annoyed that Charlie had even put that together instead of assuming it was the real Todd.!<

>! \#3 makes me think that Alex/mafia could have already found Beatrix’s address but needed Charlie to arrive at the house so Beatrix would not suspect that she’s about to die. So she set up a Finsta pretending it’s Bea’s, and after the murder, she really pushes Charlie to “think” about how to find her, just like she manipulated the assassin to choose her as the patsy. !<",7,1751747467.0,Pokerface,12,0.89,False

Body:

Plot I remember (read ~7–10 years ago):
	•	Main character: Black man (maybe a journalist or lawyer), embarrassed about his humble roots (mother was a maid), lives beyond his means by buying expensive clothes.
He visits a pub, orders a coffee, and the pub owner insults him racially.
	•	Cold case: A girl aged 13–14 (name starts with C) disappeared in the 1970s–80s. She had a best friend and there was an older guy they’ve been hangin with.
	•	Suspect: The older man, later a pub owner.
	•	Helper: A woman he meets—possibly Inuit or Indigenous—gives him case papers and visits the adult version of the missing girl’s best friend.
	•	Best friend’s arc: She becomes an alcoholic and marries a gambler. The helper visits her home and notices surveillance/camera paranoia.
	•	Themes: Class shame, racism, surveillance, addiction, poverty vs. appearance.

1lsj7yd,https://davidbuckingham.net/2021/04/14/deschooling-society-revisiting-ivan-illich-after-lockdown/,Deschooling society? Revisiting Ivan Illich after lockdown,">Illich’s argument is perhaps the most extreme instance of a broader critique of schooling that continues to gain support, as much from the libertarian Right as the radical Left. There is a grand tradition of schools being blamed for all the problems of society – illiteracy, violence, drugs, inequality, you name it – and yet simultaneously proposed as the solution to them. Announcements of the imminent demise of the school can be traced back to the early twentieth century; although most anti-school campaigners tend to stop short of abolition and propose instead a reconfiguration, in the form of networks, community-based learning centres, and home schooling.

>The challenge to the ‘factory system’ of schooling, and the ‘industrial era’ institution of the school, has had a particular appeal to enthusiasts for educational technology. In the early days of the cinema, the inventor Thomas Edison proposed that the cinema would be the school of the future; while in the 1980s, Seymour Papert was declaring that the computer would ‘blow up the school’. Although Illich’s book pre-dates the internet, there is a remarkable affinity between his account of a deschooled society and the wilder predictions of contemporary ‘cyber-utopians’, with their rhetoric about empowerment and participation.

>It’s important to locate Deschooling Society in the context of Illich’s work as a whole. It is part of a broader argument that runs through a sequence of other books he published in the early 1970s, of which the most famous are probably Tools for Conviviality and Medical Nemesis. His criticisms of the school are part of a wider critique of the institutionalisation of modern industrial society, whose effects he also traces in medicine, in transportation and city planning, and in the church. Illich argues that institutions often create the needs and problems they purport to address; and in doing so, they generate patterns of dependency, requiring us to defer to the authority of self-sustaining coteries of experts (such as teachers and doctors). Services like education and health care come to be seen as things that can only be delivered by professionals.

>Although he doesn’t use the term, it’s probably fair to describe Illich as an anarchist (albeit not of the stereotypical black-clad, bomb-throwing variety). In place of institutions, he favours informal, decentralised networks. While institutions inevitably reserve power for the professional elite, networks are non-hierarchical: they foster autonomy, freedom and self-worth. Nobody, he argues, should have the right to dictate to anybody else what and when they should learn.

>Illich’s arguments here also reflect his concern with ecological issues. Institutionalisation, he argues, creates forms of consumerism and excessive energy use that are leading to the destruction of the natural environment. It reflects a broader ‘mania’ for economic growth, and a harmful faith in scientific ‘progress’, that has to be resisted. His target here, however, is primarily industrialism rather than capitalism: although he is somewhat ambivalent about Mao’s China, he regards Soviet communism as just as culpable in this respect as Western capitalism.

>Deschooling Society offers a throughgoing condemnation of the school as an institution. Most learning, Illich argues, occurs outside school, and many people can effectively teach us things. But schools – and the education system more widely – are constantly attempting to assert their monopoly over teaching and learning. Privileging school learning renders children helpless: they become dependent on teacherly authority, which further disables their autonomy. This, Illich argues, is like confusing medical treatment with health care, police protection with safety, or the church with salvation. People’s non-material needs are redefined as needs for commodities and services provided by others.

>This institutionalisation of learning entails a kind of confidence trick, which is achieved through a series of rituals. Teachers take on the role of clerics, prying into the private affairs of students, while preaching to a captive audience. In fact, Illich argues, schools are not very good at teaching skills, or achieving the broader aims of ‘liberal education’. They attempt to measure learning in ways that are quite ill-suited to the task. Large numbers of students simply drop out, and some of the most troublesome are forced and encouraged to do so. Schooling, Illich argues, is entirely inimical to social equality.

>Almost twenty years before the World Wide Web was being hatched, he seems to be imagining the internet. Notably, he identifies four different kinds of ‘learning webs’, that might make up an alternative educational infrastructure: reference services for educational objects, giving access to museums and libraries; skill exchanges, where people could offer specific expertise; peer matching, where learners could contact partners for collaborative learning; and finally, reference services for educators-at-large, offering means of contacting ‘teachers’ who might or might not be paid professionals.

>These webs make use of existing resources – libraries, museums, even textbooks and forms of programmed instruction – but in radically decentralised ways. Learners are imagined posting their interests on a computerised database in a community ‘skills centre’, and then meeting other learners (or potential teachers) in coffee shops. (It’s perhaps surprising that Starbucks doesn’t have quotes from Illich emblazoned on its walls…) In these proposals, there’s not much sense of the computer as a repository of information or knowledge in itself: it’s primarily seen as a device for educational match-making.

>Illich’s deschooled utopia seems to operate primarily on reciprocity, fairness and good will. At some points, he suggests that people might use educational ‘vouchers’ (and even an ‘edu-credit card’), an idea later favoured by advocates of the educational ‘free market’. Yet this is a world in which the profit motive is somehow magically absent. Questions about how people might earn a living, or about how we might know which services or individuals to trust, are somehow irrelevant.

>In the age of ‘surveillance capitalism’, the contrast between this utopian imagining and the reality of the contemporary internet hardly needs to be stated. Ultimately, the internet isn’t a convivial technology in the way Illich defines it. Convivial tools are, crucially, limited: they are simple to use and subject to individual control. The internet inclines to what Illich calls ‘radical monopoly’ (that is, it becomes inescapable), especially as it comes to be governed by large commercial companies; and its infrastructure is by no means amenable to control (or indeed necessarily understood) by its users. It is perhaps hardly surprising that, far from ‘blowing up the school’, digital technology has been pressed into service by existing institutions, used as means of delivering pre-programmed content and of increasingly pervasive surveillance and assessment.

>Meanwhile, the reliance on technology provided a further alibi for the continuing privatisation of the education system, in higher education as well as in schools. As in many other areas (most notably health care itself), the pandemic provided a great market opportunity; and in several cases, there has been clear evidence of corruption. Of course, this is a much longer-term project, which is driven through powerful networks of state actors, global economic policy bodies, consultancy companies, so-called philanthropists, and the financial services sector. But the large technology companies are now coming to play a critical role in this outsourcing of public education to private providers – not least as the logics of ‘datafication’ are coming to dominate education. While smaller for-profit providers may be creating much of the content, it is Microsoft, Google and Amazon who are generating massive profits from providing the hardware and the infrastructure. And for such companies, schools are merely the gateway to the much larger and more lucrative home market.

>Deschooling Society has a value as a kind of thought experiment. By taking a much longer and broader historical and global view, it helps to question categories and concepts we tend to take for granted. What is a child, what is a teacher, what is education? Why, in particular, do we tend to think of learning primarily in the context of the school – a particular kind of institution, with a very specific form and organisational structure? What, indeed, are schools actually for? It’s possible that the experience of the pandemic has sharpened these debates. Yet as I look at contemporary writing about education – and especially the shelves of books about the so-called ‘science of learning’ – discussion of these bigger questions seems to be in sadly short supply.

My best friend and I slept together on holiday. We’ve been friends for seven years. On holiday, the first few nights he was all over me — he’s recently single and was kissing my neck, cuddling me, and stroking my arm. We were staying in the same room, the tension was high, and we spoke about what it would mean if we had sex.

I said I thought it would change things. He didn’t really say much — he just kept saying we should. I kept saying it would overcomplicate things. He mentioned that if we were together, we’d argue too much, which felt like a weird thing to say. I told him I didn’t want to do it for a quick fix, but also that I didn’t know what it would mean if we did. Anyway, we ended up having great, tense sex.

Then, for the next four days, he kind of ignored me. He seemed super anxious and different around me. I felt super led on and confused — like he went from 100 to zero. He didn’t approach me until the last day, when he finally said he’d just felt really scared and anxious, and that every time he was going to talk to me about it, he panicked. (I did kind of belittle him for not speaking to me for those four days.)

Two months passed, and we went for a coffee. I told him I think it made me feel something, and that it didn’t feel casual. He agreed. He didn’t say it outright, but he said we’ve always had something and we’ve always been super flirty. He said he panicked afterwards, and that it’s weird having sex with a best friend — that he’d never done that before or had a friend where he’d thought of them that way.

He said we suck at communicating so we’re better off as friends. He also mentioned that the last time we all hung out as a group and his girlfriend was there, after she left, the tension between us was really high — and it was. We did flirt a lot.

He said the morning after, when he woke up and I wasn’t in bed, he thought he’d fucked up. But he also said he didn’t regret it in the slightest. I guess I told him how I felt — he didn’t explicitly say how he felt back, but he agreed with what I was saying. I said I didn’t want to date him, but that I did feel something.

I just don’t know if he’s letting me down easy, or if he’s too scared to admit something, or if he’s just not picking up on the hints that I like him.

“California DOJ Memo OAG-2022-02: A Blueprint for Violating the Second Amendment”

🧾 SIDE-BY-SIDE BREAKDOWN:

🧠 What Bruen Said (2022, SCOTUS):

> “The constitutional right to bear arms in public for self-defense is not a ‘second-class right,’ subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees.”
— NYSRPA v. Bruen, 142 S. Ct. 2111, 2156 (2022)



> “We know of no other constitutional right that an individual may exercise only after demonstrating to government officers some special need.”
— Bruen, at 2156



🔻 Key Holding: Subjective “may-issue” regimes violate the Second Amendment because rights cannot be dependent on discretionary approval by government officials.


---

🧾 What California’s OAG-2022-02 Memo Says:

> “Permitting authorities may still inquire into an applicant’s moral character and may deny a license if there is a lack of good moral character.”
— OAG-2022-02, p. 3



⚠️ The memo admits that ""good cause"" is unconstitutional, but then flips the denial tool to something even more subjective and undefined — “moral character.”


---

⚖️ THE CONFLICT:

SCOTUS (Bruen) Says…	California DOJ Memo Says…

No discretion to deny based on “need” or “justification”	Denials now based on “moral character” instead of “need”
Rights must be historically grounded, not invented post-hoc	Vague, modern standards like “moral character” have no historical basis
Objective, shall-issue standards are required	Subjective, still-may-issue-by-excuse system
Rights can’t be chilled or taxed	Still costly, time-consuming, and uncertain



---

📢 TALKING POINTS YOU CAN USE:

California's memo is not compliance with Bruen—it’s subversion.

The memo tells law enforcement how to deny a constitutional right by switching from one unconstitutional method (“good cause”) to another (“moral character”).

There is no clear, objective definition of “good moral character” — making it ripe for abuse, just like before Bruen.

The state is attempting to retain gatekeeping power over an inalienable right, which is exactly what Bruen prohibited.

If you can’t be forced to prove you “need” to speak, vote, or go to church — you can’t be forced to prove you “deserve” to carry.

> ""California’s OAG-2022-02 memo is a roadmap for how to evade the Supreme Court’s ruling in Bruen and continue denying CCW permits based on arbitrary, undefined standards like 'moral character.' This is not compliance—it is state-sponsored resistance to the Constitution.""

📄 CASE SUMMARY FOR ATTORNEY SUPPORT

Case: Vallejos v. Rob Bonta and Chad Bianco
Core Issue: Challenge to California’s unconstitutional CCW permitting scheme under Bruen


---

🔹 Client Background & Standing

I am a law-abiding citizen and a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL).

I currently hold a valid Arizona CCW permit and have passed all required state and federal background checks.

I applied for a California CCW in Riverside County and was ultimately denied, not due to disqualification, but based on subjective reasoning and false accusations that fall outside the lawful scope of the appeal process.

I even received a letter from the California DOJ Bureau of Firearms confirming that I am not a prohibited person under state or federal law.

I filed a formal appeal (BOF 1031), but the state still upheld the denial using vague and arbitrary standards, in clear contradiction to Supreme Court precedent in NYSRPA v. Bruen.



---

🔹 Constitutional Problem: State-Sanctioned Workaround to Bruen

After the Supreme Court’s decision in Bruen (June 2022), which struck down New York’s “may-issue” scheme and required jurisdictions to adopt objective, non-discretionary shall-issue standards, California issued Information Bulletin OAG-2022-02 the very next day (June 24, 2022). This memo:

1. Acknowledges that “good cause” requirements are unconstitutional and must no longer be enforced.


2. Simultaneously instructs issuing agencies (sheriffs, police, etc.) to rely on “good moral character” as a continuing denial basis.


3. Claims that agencies may evaluate an applicant’s entire background under “totality of circumstances” to determine moral character—without defining any objective standards.


4. Offers no historical justification for such a subjective review process, which is now the required test under Bruen.



In practice, this means the State removed one unconstitutional barrier (“good cause”) and replaced it with another (“moral character”)—one that’s even broader, more subjective, and just as unconstitutional.


---

🔹 Why My Denial Was Unlawful

I met every objective statutory requirement: no criminal convictions, completed training, residency in Riverside County, background check clearance.

Yet my application was denied not for disqualification, but due to discretionary judgment by the sheriff’s office—a process that should’ve been struck down under Bruen.

The appeal was supposed to solely determine whether I was disqualified from owning or carrying a firearm. The DOJ admitted I was not. Still, they let the subjective denial stand.

This mirrors a systemic practice enabled by OAG-2022-02, which gives cover to issuing agencies that continue to deny law-abiding citizens for arbitrary reasons.



---

🔹 Legal Question for Litigation

Does the State of California violate the Second and Fourteenth Amendments by instructing local licensing authorities to continue denying carry permits using vague, discretionary standards like “moral character,” despite the Supreme Court’s ruling in Bruen?

> This is not a case about public safety or criminal behavior. It’s about a constitutional right being denied to a non-prohibited person, by state actors knowingly using legally invalid criteria.




---

🔹 Supporting Documents Available

DOJ letter confirming I am not a prohibited person.

Full text of OAG-2022-02 memo.

Timeline of relevant legal developments post-Bruen.

DOJ’s own acknowledgment that “good cause” cannot be enforced, yet denial persisted under a different name.



---

🔹 Relief Sought

Immediate injunctive relief ordering the issuance of my CCW.

Declaratory relief that OAG-2022-02 and its implementation violate Bruen and the Second Amendment.

Broader impact: strike down the scheme statewide to protect all similarly situated applicants in California.

🔥 Hey 2A family, I wanted to bring some serious attention to my federal case: VALLEJOS v. ROB BONTA and CHAD BIANCO, where I’m challenging the unconstitutional CCW permit scheme in California. The current process is costly, burdensome, and designed to price out and screen out law-abiding citizens—even those who can pass background checks and hold out-of-state permits.

I’m doing this pro se, without a lawyer, because no major 2A org wanted to step up. I truly believe this fight is for ALL of us, especially in states like CA where they continue to violate Bruen and treat the Second Amendment like a privilege.

🙏🏼 If there’s any chance  let's Raise awareness could be the spark we need for real change. Appreciate all that you’re doing for the 2A community!

Stay armed. Stay free. 💪🇺🇸

💰 Let’s break down how the CCW permit scheme became a full-blown business — not a public safety measure:

Most instructors charge $275 per person for a mandatory 16-hour class.

They cram in 20 to 25 students every weekend.

That’s $5,500 to $6,875 every weekend.

And guess what? These classes are sold out all year — 52 weekends straight.


Now here’s the math:

➡️ Weekly: $6,875
➡️ Monthly (4 weeks): $27,500
➡️ Yearly (52 weeks): $357,500

That’s one instructor clearing over 350k per year — just for “training” people to ask for permission to use their rights.

But here’s the real kicker:

🧀 The so-called “training” is a joke.

You watch some dated safety videos

Eat pizza and sip coffee

Sit through a sales pitch for carry insurance like USCCA

Then squeeze off a few rounds during a rushed, minimal range session


It’s not quality firearms instruction — it’s a glorified seminar with a price tag, all required just to maybe get your rights back.

They’re profiting off your oppression.
And because of the money involved, they’ve got zero interest in helping end this unconstitutional CCW scheme — it’s their golden goose.

Time to wake up, folks. The Second Amendment doesn’t come with a price tag.

I lived in Ukraine for 10 years, until the full-scale war, and have returned several times since the war on volunteer trips (and to adopt my dog).

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I crossed into Ukraine for the first time after a long bus ride from Berlin. I didn’t know what to expect — but a punk with a green mohawk offering me his seat was not on the list.

It was March, 2010. After leaving Berlin and riding through Poland, I reached the border, got my exit stamp, and trudged the fifty or so yards of no man’s land to the Ukrainian side. Ukraine had everything Poland had — fields, farmers, tractors, sullen youth, frumpy old ladies — but it all felt a bit dirtier, a bit dingier on this side of the line. Nineteen years after independence, it still hadn’t shaken off its Soviet past.

Just over the border, I found and boarded my very first *marshrutka*. A *marshrutka* is basically a privately owned minibus, with the owner usually doubling as the driver. He’s invariably a grumpy, middle-aged man with a cigarette in one hand, coffee in the other, and he’s steering mostly with his knees. Don’t bother saying hello — he’ll just grunt or yell at you. They’re Ukraine’s answer to Seinfeld’s Soup Nazi. Pay the fare (no large bills!) and find a seat.

If there is a seat. In my case, there wasn’t. So I stood there, my bags scattered around me, and off we went. It wasn’t long before I realized I was attracting attention. About ten feet away, facing me, sat one of the scariest individuals I had ever seen. He had a green mohawk, black leather covered in metal studs, and boots made for kicking ass. And he was staring at me — up and down, without blinking. *Great,* I thought. *I’ve been in Ukraine five minutes, and I’m about to get beat up.*

And then suddenly he stands up, and he says, “Would you like to take my seat?” I was flabbergasted. And I accepted. That is Ukraine in a nutshell, and something I’ve witnessed over and over again — frightening and hard on the outside, warm as a teddy bear on the inside.

I was finally in Ukraine, and my soul’s tattoo had begun to be inked.",1,1751746799.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False

I’ve read all your responses, I tried to respond to as many as possible, and I will try to respond to some more soon as I really appreciate everyone commenting. 

Your judgments helped me hold on to reality when my entire family was gaslighting me.

Even though I rationally knew I hadn’t done anything wrong, my emotions were really struggling, especially since I’ve spent most of my life as one of my mom’s defenders. That only started to shift a month ago. So emotionally, it felt awful to stand my ground. I needed every single one of your perspectives to fight the doubt that crept in.

Update:

My aunt (56F) and I (44F) talked on on What’s App call on a Thursday evening. That was the conversation where she suddenly had the idea to suggest couple’s counseling for me and my mom (62F) in hopes of repairing our relationship. I immediately agreed which shocked my aunt, even though I am literally the only one of our family who has ever willingly attended counseling for an extended amount of time. Well, accept for my other aunt, my father’s sister (61F) who was also sexually abused by my grandfather when she was a child, which I only found out when I disclosed my abuse to her a few weeks ago.

Anyways, I know my mom and my aunt talk all the time and physically meet for coffee every Friday morning. So I kind of knew that my aunt would suggest this to my mom the very next morning. But I heard nothing over the weekend. Bad sign already and I assumed my mom had simply refused. I did not want to come across as too pushy or needy to my aunt, as she already had a warped opinion about me, so I waited a week to text her and ask what my mom thought about her suggestion.

Her reply was:

“Well, when I spoke to her on Friday, she was open to it.  
So she hasn’t contacted you yet?  
She did wonder how that would be possible, and whether the counselor would speak our native language or English? I think, and so does she, that a native language one might be easier for her to express herself. But that's something you two need to agree on.  
I think she wants to let it sink in first before reaching out.  
Of course, you can also contact her……..”  
  
I replied that of course it should be a native language counselor, and that I am sure there are plenty homecountry counselors that do therapy online these days, just like here in the country I live now. I also made clear that I was not able to contact my mom right now as she had asked for distance from me and I was respecting her boundary. But that I told my mom I was always open for repair and never to hesitate reaching out if she was ever ready to work on our relationship.

My aunt replied she would “throw the idea out there again” when se saw my mom next.

So, honestly? I don’t believe my mom was actually open to therapy. I think she said she was to keep up appearances of being “the good mom”,  like *the real victim* of her daughter’s supposedly unjustified anger. Saying yes makes her look mature, but then she immediately threw up roadblocks, debating native language vs English therapist (as if I was the one who might suggest an English one?) and then, silence.

My aunt likely thought my mom would take it from there, so didn’t follow up herself. When I told her I still hadn’t heard anything, she seemed surprised. And then, like everyone always does, she jumped in to make excuses for my mom.

That pattern kills me. Everyone around me enables and excuses her behavior, while holding me to impossible emotional standards. And yes, I am being entitled now asking others to give me some emotional slack for a change, but maybe I *am* allowed to sound a little entitled right now. Just this once. Just in this one part of my life.

A few weeks ago, my therapist said something that stuck with me: “This entire family dynamic is exactly the kind of environment where CSA thrives.” She was not wrong.

\_\_\_\_  
  
While I was writing this update, my aunt texted me: “Hey OP, I spoke to mom this afternoon and asked if she’s thought more about therapy. She says she wants *you* to first process your trauma and *then* maybe look at rebuilding the relationship, possibly with therapy. That doesn’t mean you can’t contact her, because she’s totally fine with that. 😘”

So yeah, I’m the broken one, not her. Again, I do all the hard work, and maybe then she’ll show up. But until then, she gets to sit back and look like she’s being reasonable.

  
Well, I guess I have my answer now. Can’t say I am not totally devastated. But, at least I have certainty.

Edited to add: This last interaction made it clear to me that there is no other option left than NC with all of them. I am not responding to my aunt and I am sure as heck not getting in contact with my mom. You want me to get over my trauma first? I’m no expert but I think that’ll take a long while, if ever. Oh and you are adding tremendously to that trauma, so add a few more years? So I guess you won’t be part of my and my children’s lives…

“California DOJ Memo OAG-2022-02: A Blueprint for Violating the Second Amendment”

🧾 SIDE-BY-SIDE BREAKDOWN:

🧠 What Bruen Said (2022, SCOTUS):

> “The constitutional right to bear arms in public for self-defense is not a ‘second-class right,’ subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees.”
— NYSRPA v. Bruen, 142 S. Ct. 2111, 2156 (2022)



> “We know of no other constitutional right that an individual may exercise only after demonstrating to government officers some special need.”
— Bruen, at 2156



🔻 Key Holding: Subjective “may-issue” regimes violate the Second Amendment because rights cannot be dependent on discretionary approval by government officials.


---

🧾 What California’s OAG-2022-02 Memo Says:

> “Permitting authorities may still inquire into an applicant’s moral character and may deny a license if there is a lack of good moral character.”
— OAG-2022-02, p. 3



⚠️ The memo admits that ""good cause"" is unconstitutional, but then flips the denial tool to something even more subjective and undefined — “moral character.”


---

⚖️ THE CONFLICT:

SCOTUS (Bruen) Says…	California DOJ Memo Says…

No discretion to deny based on “need” or “justification”	Denials now based on “moral character” instead of “need”
Rights must be historically grounded, not invented post-hoc	Vague, modern standards like “moral character” have no historical basis
Objective, shall-issue standards are required	Subjective, still-may-issue-by-excuse system
Rights can’t be chilled or taxed	Still costly, time-consuming, and uncertain



---

📢 TALKING POINTS YOU CAN USE:

California's memo is not compliance with Bruen—it’s subversion.

The memo tells law enforcement how to deny a constitutional right by switching from one unconstitutional method (“good cause”) to another (“moral character”).

There is no clear, objective definition of “good moral character” — making it ripe for abuse, just like before Bruen.

The state is attempting to retain gatekeeping power over an inalienable right, which is exactly what Bruen prohibited.

If you can’t be forced to prove you “need” to speak, vote, or go to church — you can’t be forced to prove you “deserve” to carry.

📝 Suggested Caption/Quote for Petition or Lawsuit:

> ""California’s OAG-2022-02 memo is a roadmap for how to evade the Supreme Court’s ruling in Bruen and continue denying CCW permits based on arbitrary, undefined standards like 'moral character.' This is not compliance—it is state-sponsored resistance to the Constitution.""

📄 CASE SUMMARY FOR ATTORNEY SUPPORT

Case: Vallejos v. Rob Bonta and Chad Bianco
Core Issue: Challenge to California’s unconstitutional CCW permitting scheme under Bruen


---

🔹 Client Background & Standing

I am a law-abiding citizen and a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL).

I currently hold a valid Arizona CCW permit and have passed all required state and federal background checks.

I applied for a California CCW in Riverside County and was ultimately denied, not due to disqualification, but based on subjective reasoning and false accusations that fall outside the lawful scope of the appeal process.

I even received a letter from the California DOJ Bureau of Firearms confirming that I am not a prohibited person under state or federal law.

I filed a formal appeal (BOF 1031), but the state still upheld the denial using vague and arbitrary standards, in clear contradiction to Supreme Court precedent in NYSRPA v. Bruen.



---

🔹 Constitutional Problem: State-Sanctioned Workaround to Bruen

After the Supreme Court’s decision in Bruen (June 2022), which struck down New York’s “may-issue” scheme and required jurisdictions to adopt objective, non-discretionary shall-issue standards, California issued Information Bulletin OAG-2022-02 the very next day (June 24, 2022). This memo:

1. Acknowledges that “good cause” requirements are unconstitutional and must no longer be enforced.


2. Simultaneously instructs issuing agencies (sheriffs, police, etc.) to rely on “good moral character” as a continuing denial basis.


3. Claims that agencies may evaluate an applicant’s entire background under “totality of circumstances” to determine moral character—without defining any objective standards.


4. Offers no historical justification for such a subjective review process, which is now the required test under Bruen.



In practice, this means the State removed one unconstitutional barrier (“good cause”) and replaced it with another (“moral character”)—one that’s even broader, more subjective, and just as unconstitutional.


---

🔹 Why My Denial Was Unlawful

I met every objective statutory requirement: no criminal convictions, completed training, residency in Riverside County, background check clearance.

Yet my application was denied not for disqualification, but due to discretionary judgment by the sheriff’s office—a process that should’ve been struck down under Bruen.

The appeal was supposed to solely determine whether I was disqualified from owning or carrying a firearm. The DOJ admitted I was not. Still, they let the subjective denial stand.

This mirrors a systemic practice enabled by OAG-2022-02, which gives cover to issuing agencies that continue to deny law-abiding citizens for arbitrary reasons.



---

🔹 Legal Question for Litigation

Does the State of California violate the Second and Fourteenth Amendments by instructing local licensing authorities to continue denying carry permits using vague, discretionary standards like “moral character,” despite the Supreme Court’s ruling in Bruen?

> This is not a case about public safety or criminal behavior. It’s about a constitutional right being denied to a non-prohibited person, by state actors knowingly using legally invalid criteria.




---

🔹 Supporting Documents Available

My CCW denial and BOF 1031 appeal documentation.

DOJ letter confirming I am not a prohibited person.

Full text of OAG-2022-02 memo.

Timeline of relevant legal developments post-Bruen.

DOJ’s own acknowledgment that “good cause” cannot be enforced, yet denial persisted under a different name.



---

🔹 Relief Sought

Immediate injunctive relief ordering the issuance of my CCW.

Declaratory relief that OAG-2022-02 and its implementation violate Bruen and the Second Amendment.

Broader impact: strike down the scheme statewide to protect all similarly situated applicants in California.

🔥 Hey 2A family, I wanted to bring some serious attention to my federal case: VALLEJOS v. ROB BONTA and CHAD BIANCO, where I’m challenging the unconstitutional CCW permit scheme in California. The current process is costly, burdensome, and designed to price out and screen out law-abiding citizens—even those who can pass background checks and hold out-of-state permits.

I’m doing this pro se, without a lawyer, because no major 2A org wanted to step up. I truly believe this fight is for ALL of us, especially in states like CA where they continue to violate Bruen and treat the Second Amendment like a privilege.

🙏🏼 If there’s any chance I could call in or be a guest on your show, I’d love to share my story and expose how deep this infringement goes. Raising awareness could be the spark we need for real change. Appreciate all that you’re doing for the 2A community!

Stay armed. Stay free. 💪🇺🇸

💰 Let’s break down how the CCW permit scheme became a full-blown business — not a public safety measure:

Most instructors charge $275 per person for a mandatory 16-hour class.

They cram in 20 to 25 students every weekend.

That’s $5,500 to $6,875 every weekend.

And guess what? These classes are sold out all year — 52 weekends straight.


Now here’s the math:

➡️ Weekly: $6,875
➡️ Monthly (4 weeks): $27,500
➡️ Yearly (52 weeks): $357,500

That’s one instructor clearing over 350k per year — just for “training” people to ask for permission to use their rights.

But here’s the real kicker:

🧀 The so-called “training” is a joke.

You watch some dated safety videos

Eat pizza and sip coffee

Sit through a sales pitch for carry insurance like USCCA

Then squeeze off a few rounds during a rushed, minimal range session


It’s not quality firearms instruction — it’s a glorified seminar with a price tag, all required just to maybe get your rights back.

They’re profiting off your oppression.
And because of the money involved, they’ve got zero interest in helping end this unconstitutional CCW scheme — it’s their golden goose.

Time to wake up, folks. The Second Amendment doesn’t come with a price tag.
