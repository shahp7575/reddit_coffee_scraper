They didn't have any drip coffee and I thought that was weird. The place has been open and a coffeehouse doesn't have drip coffee. It's like the easiest you can have and prepare. So I had to buy their crappy, sugary latte.

1q0orxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1q0orxx/need_advice_my_ex_reached_out/,"Need advice, my ex reached out","
I was blindsided by my partner of 5 years. He (25M) left me (23F) 1.5 months ago. We had issues in the relationship but we were best friends and always talked about the future like marriage and trips right up until the breakup. 

A lot of issues arose when I went off an SSRI medication. I got irritable and angry easily and eventually decided to restart the meds. The day before I was about to go back on them he left me. He went from telling me he loved me and kissing me goodnight to telling me he was unsure of us the next night. I was distraught and stayed with my mom for the weekend to let him process his emotions. He texted me 48hr later saying he thought he’d be depressed when I left but he wasn’t and he felt relieved instead. This crushed me. 

He said he’d voiced things too many times and it was too late and said he’d lost feelings for me in the past while. Which really hurt because he suppressed so many emotions and let them build up without telling me he was worried about this. I was in complete shock as we were planning a vacation 4 days before. I decided to move out 2 weeks later hoping if my stuff was gone he would feel my absence more and change his mind, I was in so much denial.

I became very depressed and was having dark thoughts which was scary. I was hormonal from my period which amplified everything and I felt so hopeless it was like a switch flipped. I was so vulnerable and texted him about how horrible I was doing. I felt so guilty about dumping my mental health on him. I cut contact again to try to respect his decision but made sure he knew I was okay.

2 weeks later he reached out admitting I was right all along and he felt things for me still and he was just numb and acted horribly during the breakup. He has apologized so many times.

I wanted him to say this for so long and he wants to meet for coffee and talk about things. However, I feel so traumatized by how depressed I became because I didn’t want to be here anymore. I know that is not his fault but I can’t seem to move on from how I felt. I love him so much and regret all my problems I created in the relationship but I don’t know if I can go back. He was so okay walking away from me forever that I feel like so much emotional trust has been shattered.

Any advice would be appreciated, please be kind I’m very fragile. Also I’m seeing a therapist for my mental health to anyone concerned💗",1,1767219077.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1q0orgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NewNeptuneSaturn/comments/1q0orgz/love/,Love,"So if romantic love is a pattern of unhappiness what does make me happy? 

Kids. They’re so honest and authentic. They shine as themselves. They use imagination and fantasy for play where adults live fantasy and imagination out of insecurity and attachment and fear. 

Family (even though they piss me off and the underlying dynamics are a minefield I still love them.)

My dogs. All dogs. They’re adorable. I love dog personalities. My morning routine at the Dogpark with my coffee is the best part of my day. I know all the dog’s names. There’s a Cane Corso puppy someone is trying to rehome. His name is Mars and he’s so so sweet and mild tempered. I wish I had the space and money to adopt him. (Its 3k!) Anyway, It’s an underrated community for sure. 

Friends. Even though I’m sensitive and a handful these days, I’m watching for consistency through conflict. I know who I trust to do their own inner work. One of my friends is getting me into her Pilates community. I’m excited. It’ll enhance the security I find in my daily routine. I crave consistency and structure that isn’t suffocating, and this will help. It’s not necessarily how other people flatter you that makes friends, it’s their inner character and the inner compass they live by. It has nothing to do with me-it’s who they are and how they choose to live/by what code that makes them worthy friends. Sometimes my Leo psyche wants too much attention and play when what she really needs is to find a healthy balance where multiple needs are met and negotiated in good faith and trust. 

Food, Coffee and Fun. Speaks for itself doesn’t it! I need the clever banter too. I can stop looking for that in love and enjoy it in the wider community around me. My siblings are extremely funny and clever. I want to be closer to them, I’ve spent too much time working and avoiding home. I’m going to drive out to see my Mom soon, I’ll see my other brothers too. I miss them. Repair is going to be hard-we definitely have suffered the Trump family destruction plan via intentional misinformation political propaganda and mean-spirited, passive aggressive internet shitposting. Plus, all that drama only revealed the underlying dynamics and grievances that were already there. It’s time for all of it to be dealt with. 

Nature. I love nature. I feel more regulated and spiritually aligned when I prioritize time outside to “connect”. I want to start camping too.

Romantic love has always taken me away from myself. I don’t want that anymore. I want a life that feels fulfilling. I want contentment. Letting go of the illusion of love will get me where I need and want to go. 

I need to start asking, and more importantly *feeling*, is this a temporary high (am I in polarity) or is this honestly fulfilling? I want safety and peace. I can do that alone, easily. That’s why I’m always so happy after alchemizing a massive breakup. I finally reconnect and align with what my soul actually needs. 

True Love doesn’t involve another person. Not really.

1q0olat,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0olat,A Ferrari for Her & a Fake Marriage for Me? I'm Burning His 'Happy' Home to the Ground,"Not yet, babe. You're not ready—my parents would eat you alive.""


Every time I asked about meeting his family, my CEO husband shut me down with that line. And I actually bought it.


Until today—


I closed the billion-dollar deal that made his company and finally showed up at his family's door.


Who answered?


A nine-year-old kid. Looked me up and down like I was trash.


""Ew. Who are you? Why are you looking for MY dad?""


Before I could speak, a maid dragged me inside.


Right there in the middle of the living room—a wedding photo. My husband and his assistant.


The maid grabbed my arm, all excited. ""Can you believe it? They've been married TEN YEARS! And their little boy—he's gotten so big!""


""Oh, and she just landed this MASSIVE contract—like, billions! Sir's over the moon. Whole party planned for tonight!""


I watched the kid throw himself into my husband's arms. Watched that assistant lean into them like they were one happy family.


My brain flatlined.


So ""not ready yet""? A lie.


So our ten-year marriage? Fake.


So every success I bled for? Just a gift to her.


But here's what he doesn't know—


I didn't need him.


He needed me.


And that empire he thinks he built? I'm about to take it back!


---


Around the corner, my husband Garrett Vaughn had his hand wrapped around his assistant Sienna's waist. Gave it a squeeze that made me want to puke.


He laughed, voice all low. ""Stop babying him. Kid's nine and still climbing all over his dad. Come on.""


Then leaned right into her ear—didn't even try to hide it. ""Those arms? Mine. Tonight.""


Sienna's face went red. Pushed him but she was smiling. ""God, ten years and you still want more?""


His eyes went dark. Thumb rubbing circles on her hip. ""Look at you right now... how could I not?""


My nails dug into my palms so hard I should've bled. But didn't feel a thing.


They were all over each other like I wasn't even there.


The joke? I basically wasn't.


Ten years married and I'd never been allowed in this house. Meanwhile they'd been playing house here the whole time. Kid and all.


Garrett wasn't done. Started whispering about getting the kid to bed so they could ""take care of business.""


That's when he saw me standing there. Face went white as a sheet.


Froze up. Lips shaking. ""Reagan... w-what're you doing here?""


Everything went dead quiet.


Sienna looked at me, confused. ""Who's this?""


He practically threw her off him. Cleared his throat. ""Honey, this is Reagan Ashford. Sales department—always traveling, so you probably haven't met.""


I laughed. Couldn't help it. Ten years. Built this company with him from nothing. Now I'm just ""sales.""


Sienna didn't even respond to him. Just looked me over, eyes landing on my bracelet.


The look on her face? Pure disgust.


""How's some low-level sales girl wearing something like that? Doesn't it look exactly like the one I threw out last time?""


The humiliation hit me like a truck.


Garrett jumped in fast. ""Babe, you know how it is—some people can't afford the real thing so they dig through trash. You tossed that bracelet at the office, she probably fished it out.""


Just like that. Made himself look innocent. Made me look pathetic.


He kept shooting me these desperate looks. Begging me to shut up.


But that bracelet? He'd given it to me himself.


After I closed a major deal, he came to my office, put it on my wrist with his own hands. Said it was part of a matching set and he had the other one. Told me never to take it off.


I'd promised myself right then—land the billion-dollar contract, make his parents accept me, make our marriage something real.


Missed one tiny detail though. He never wore the ""matching"" piece.


Took me this long to realize—the gift I'd been holding onto like it meant everything? Just garbage someone else threw out.


And the real reason he wouldn't let me meet his family? He was already married to someone else.


I took a breath. Forced down everything burning in my chest. Gave them my coldest smile.


""My bad. Didn't know it wasn't mine."" I ripped the bracelet off and threw it on the floor. ""Here. Take it back.""


The sound of it shattering echoed through the whole room.


Garrett lunged at me. Slapped me across the face so hard my ears rang.


""You just broke my wife's stuff! Reagan, you're WAY out of line!""


Five red marks burning across my cheek.


I touched my face, looking at this man I'd given everything to. Realized I didn't even know him.


""Yeah. My mistake.""


With that, I turned to leave.


""Wait.""


Chapter 2


Sienna's voice stopped me. All fake-sweet. ""Don't rush off. Since you're here anyway, might as well stay, right?""


""So tonight? My father-in-law's celebrating ME—that billion-dollar deal I just closed. You're with the company, aren't you? Stick around. Party's gonna be fun.""


Made sure to really emphasize ""billion-dollar deal."" Eyes daring me to say something.


Garrett's face twitched. Looked like he wanted to speak. But Sienna's glare shut him up.


She glanced around with this smug look. ""My husband had this whole place redone for me. Everything's exactly how I like it. Pick any room you want—make yourself at home.""


""NO!""


The kid suddenly screamed. Grabbed onto Sienna's leg. ""Mom! I don't want this homeless lady in our house! She's gross! She'll make everything stink!""


""Look how dark she is! Her clothes are all nasty! She probably crawled out of a dumpster! Make her leave!""


Sienna's smile got even wider.


I looked at her—all pampered and perfect.


Then down at my own hands—rough and beat up from years of hustling. Skin dark from being outside constantly.


For Garrett and those deals, I'd worked myself half to death. Drank until I had a bleeding ulcer. Never complained once.


But ten years of that?


A complete joke.


I pulled out my phone, laughing bitterly—return tickets sold out. Stuck here whether I liked it or not.


Second I dropped my bag in the guest room, Garrett called.


""I TOLD you not to come here. But you just had to show up anyway, huh? Trying to embarrass me on purpose?""


""Reagan, listen to me—this little stunt you pulled? It's disgusting. I'm pissed. Really pissed. And don't expect me to forgive you anytime soon!""


Listened to him rant. My fingers curling into fists.


Ten years. Every fight went exactly like this.


He'd screw up. Somehow flip it around. Wait for me to come crawling back begging.


And I always did. Like some pathetic dog throwing away my dignity just to make him happy.


This time I finally worked up the nerve. Wanted to ask him—""How can you be legally married to two people?""


But before I could get the words out, line went dead.


I tried calling back. Blocked.


Guess I didn't even deserve to ask questions.


My chest felt hollow. Like someone had scooped out my heart. Couldn't even feel the pain anymore.


Standing by the window staring at nothing when the door slammed open.


Sienna stormed in. That sick smile on her face.


SMACK!


Stack of photos hit me in the face. Sharp edges cutting my cheek.


""So YOU'RE the side piece? Thought I didn't know about you?""


I clenched my fists, voice coming out rough. ""I'm his legal wife! We have a marriage certificate!""


""Marriage certificate?"" Sienna burst out laughing.


Pulled out some documents. ""Your marriage certificate's fake, sweetie. Whole thing's been one big con!""


""Only reason he kept you around this long? You're useful. Like a loyal little dog who does whatever he says.""


I grabbed the papers with shaking hands. Vision going dark.


Right there in black and white—my marriage certificate was fake.


Sienna smoothed out her skirt. Tone all casual.


""Garrett told me himself. Said you were pathetic enough to work for scraps—barely asked for a salary, and you'd even spend YOUR money buying HIM gifts.""


""Oh, and all those proposals you stayed up all night working on? Every deal you drank yourself sick closing? All under MY name now.""


With that, she shoved a stack of photos in my face.


""Wow. Didn't realize you were such a freak. Garrett showed me all of this—he was actually proud of it. Guess when you can't satisfy a man the regular way, you gotta try this kinky shit instead. Embarrassing.""


Photos showed me wearing cat ears. On my knees. Worse things I couldn't look at.


Garrett had told me this was just ""couple's fun.""


So I'd humiliated myself trying to make him happy.


Yet he'd turned it all into entertainment.


Sienna kicked me in the chest. Sneered down at me.


""Oh, and these photos? Garrett posted them on the company forum ages ago. Wanna know what everyone's saying?""


""That you're some ugly toad trying to play sexy kitten."" She smirked. ""It's hilarious.""


I hit the floor. Pain in my chest nothing compared to the rage burning through me.


I'd known Garrett first. That assistant came later.


Somehow I'd become the mistress getting humiliated.


Couldn't stay here another second.


""I'm done. You'll never see me again.""


I dragged my suitcase toward the door.


But Garrett grabbed my wrist at the hallway corner.


Chapter 3


""Where do you think you're going this late?"" His face all annoyed. ""Can't just come and go whenever you feel like it. What do you think this place is?""


Looking at him acting all righteous, I almost laughed at how insane this was.


Just closed the biggest deal of my career. Rushed straight here desperate for his family's approval.


Found out about his happy little family instead.


""Mr. Vaughn,"" I said coldly, yanking my wrist free. ""Bit late to pretend you care, don't you think?""


His eyebrows drew together. ""Reagan, what's with the attitude? Who gave you permission to talk to me like that?""


About to leave when rapid footsteps echoed down the hall.


Garrett's son came running with a baseball bat. Swung it hard into my shin.


""AH!""


Pain made my legs buckle.


What shocked me more—watching that little brat throw himself backward, land on his ass, start wailing. ""The homeless lady hit me! She hit me!""


I stared at him in disbelief. Before I could react, Sienna came running. Scooped up the kid. Screamed at me.


""You homewrecking witch! Coming here causing trouble wasn't enough? Now you're hitting my son?""


""Look at yourself! If anything happens to my boy, I'll destroy you!""


Staff immediately surrounded us. Pointing. Whispering.


""Being a mistress is bad enough—hitting a kid? Shameless!""


""If I were the lady of the house, I'd strip her naked and throw her in the dumpster where she belongs!""


""Right? Some trashy nobody trying to start drama here. Without our lady, this company would be nothing!""


I grabbed the wall and pulled myself up, leg screaming.


Worse than that? Garrett's reaction.


Didn't even glance at me. Just crouched down checking on his son.


Once he confirmed the kid was fine, Garrett suddenly grabbed a fistful of my hair. Voice vicious in a way I'd never heard.


""Apologize to my son!""


Scalp felt like it was tearing. I kept my jaw clenched. ""I didn't touch him. Why should I apologize?""


""Garrett,"" I said, eyes burning. ""We've known each other fifteen years. Together for ten. Even if you wanted to marry your assistant and have a kid—why couldn't you just TELL me? You think I'd have made some pathetic scene?""


""I might not have much self-respect left, but I wouldn't have stood in your way. So why humiliate me like this? Why give me a fake marriage certificate? Turn me into a joke for the entire company?""


Something flickered in Garrett's eyes. But gone in a second. Replaced by cold nothing.


He let go of my hair. Looked down at me. ""Reagan, I thought you were smarter than this. Guess I was wrong.""


Garrett had the staff pin my shoulders down, forcing me to my knees.


""This is what you get for showing up uninvited. Deal with it.""


He turned to Sienna. ""Babe, go ahead. Hit her till you feel better. Till our son's happy.""


Kid's face lit up. Grabbed a crystal ashtray off the coffee table and hurled it at me.


Sharp edge sliced my forehead open. Blood immediately running down my face.


That's when Sienna suddenly put on this worried act. Completely different from how vicious she'd been earlier.


""Babe, maybe we should stop.""


Garrett laughed coldly. Grabbed Sienna's wrist. ""What're you scared of? I told you to hit her, so hit her!""


He wrapped his hand around hers. Started slapping me with it.


Sienna pretended to resist at first. Then started putting her own force behind it. Left bloody scratches across my face.


By the time they got bored, I was collapsed on the floor. Vision going black.


Sienna stood over me with that smug smile. Timing perfect as always.


""Babe, we should lock her in the basement for now. The Ashford heiress is coming soon—richest family in Manhattan. Can't have her seeing this mess.""


Garrett looked at me covered in blood and sneered.


""I told you this morning to think about what you did. Wouldn't listen. Brought this on yourself, Reagan. Go cool off in the basement!""


""When you learn how to behave, then you can come out!""


In the damp dark basement, staff shoved me hard.


I hit the ground. Blood still seeping from my forehead. Warm liquid sliding down my face.


""Disgusting homewrecker!""


Older maid spat right in my face.


""Look at yourself! Coming here acting like you own the place!""


Younger maid added her own spit.


Then the iron door slammed shut. Darkness swallowed me whole.


I curled up against the wall. Drowning in despair.


Ten years. This was what I got.


My hands were shaking so bad I could barely get my phone out. The dim screen lit up my pathetic face.


That number I hadn't called in forever—right now it was my only shot.


""Hello? Reagan?""


My sister's voice came through, warm but surprised.


My throat closed up. Tried to speak. Nothing came out but this choked sound.


""Sis,"" I managed to say, and suddenly I was crying. ""I messed up so bad.""


""Where are you?"" Her voice went sharp with worry. ""Did that piece of trash Garrett do something to you?""


""I want to come back to Ashford Industries..."" My eyes squeezed shut. Tears running down my face.


Silence on the other end. Then I heard her crying too.


""Dad was going to leave you everything. But you just HAD to throw it all away for that country nobody and his startup!""


Her voice caught. ""Something's wrong. You're hurt, aren't you?""


""Sis,"" I said, feeling like a lost kid who'd finally found home. ""Please come get me.""


""Hang on!"" Her voice turned sharp, commanding. ""I'm on my way right now!""


I hung up. Leaned against the freezing wall. Listened to party sounds echoing from upstairs.


Through the door crack, I could see the Vaughn house all lit up. People drinking. Laughing.


""Ms. Crane's so young and talented!""


""That billion-dollar deal just shot Vaughn Industries straight to the top!""


""Heard the Ashford heiress is coming too? Ms. Crane's really something!""


Garrett surrounded by people. Face all smug and satisfied.


Sienna on his arm. Makeup perfect. Smile sweet.


Suddenly, the main doors burst open.


Team of bodyguards in black flooded in. Woman leading them wore a sharp tailored suit. Presence like a knife.


Garrett and Sienna immediately plastered on these fake smiles. Rushed over.


""Ms. Ashford! So glad you could—""


She cut them off. Sharp eyes scanning everyone.


""My sister Reagan. Heir to Ashford Industries. Where is she?""

We don't want to drive to La Paz on the day we arrive since that'd force us to drive after dark.

  
My question - should we just stay at any cheap hotel/Airbnb around the airport and then head straight out the next day? Or should we drive a bit after arriving, stay somewhere interesting, then continue on the next day? I'd thought about driving to Todos Santos after landing in Cabo, but I still think that's pushing it for us in terms of what time we'd get there. We want to play it safe with driving. If we end up just staying in/near Cabo, should we stay in Cabo itself or go to Cabo San Lucas?

  
If we're staying overnight somewhere regardless, it'd be nice to at least make it interesting. We'd probably look for a cool beach or some natural area, check out a coffee shop (ideally a roaster?), and then head to La Paz. Nothing too crazy.",1,1767218519.0,BajaCaliforniaSur,1,1.0,False

What should I do?,"I’m a 25-year-old woman living alone in an apartment complex, and I’m feeling increasingly unsafe and anxious about my living situation.

A few weeks ago, the building’s maintenance worker (I’ll call him “Tom”) approached me in a common area near the coffee machines. We’ve crossed paths before, but we’ve never had any kind of formal or personal interaction. He started with small talk and then suddenly told me he thought we had “chemistry” and asked if I was interested in going out with him.

I was completely blindsided. I didn’t want to be rude or escalate anything in the moment, so I gave a noncommittal answer and said I’d think about it. He gave me his phone number, which I saved just to get out of the interaction and went on with my day.

The thing is: Tom is a large man (around 6’3”), in his mid-60s with white hair, and honestly comes across as creepy and a bit socially off. I’m polite to everyone, and I’m worried my basic niceness was misinterpreted as interest. What’s been eating at me is the fact that this man — who thought it was appropriate to ask out a woman 40 years younger than him — also has access to my apartment.

I couldn’t stop thinking about it and started feeling unsafe, so I talked to my family. They advised me to tell building management, not to get him in trouble, but to protect myself. I spoke with the building manager (a woman), who was very empathetic and said she understood my concerns. I asked her to help create a situation where I wouldn’t be put in danger.

Unfortunately, she escalated it to corporate. Today I was informed that Tom will **not** be fired. Corporate’s solution is to tell him that his behavior was “inappropriate.”

Now I’m terrified of retaliation.

I’m an anxious person by nature, and I can’t stop thinking about worst-case scenarios — that he could be angry, embarrassed, emotionally unstable, or resentful, and that he knows where I live and may still have access to my unit. I have pepper spray, but that doesn’t give me peace of mind. I’ve told my family and friends, but I still feel on edge in my own home.

I just want to feel safe and be able to relax where I live.

What are my next best steps to protect myself?  
Should I be pushing management harder for accommodations?  
Should I move, even though that feels unfair?  
Has anyone been in a similar situation?

I’d really appreciate advice, especially from people who’ve dealt with housing or workplace boundaries like this. I’m not trying to ruin anyone’s life — I just want peace of mind.",5,1767218295.0,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,2,1.0,False

for context, yesterday i got a brand new car (it had 15 miles on it), and it is the first car i have had since mine was totaled in a wreck 6 weeks ago. 

i brought the car home, and i told NOBODY about the vehicle. i didn’t post anything anywhere, i barely even took pictures. i have a completely new license plate and all, it’s a totally different vehicle from my last. 

the only people who know about the car are my mom, and my boyfriend, who i live with. 

yesterday, i drove the car home from the dealership (20-30 min drive), and later that afternoon, down the road through a drive thru and back. nothing weird or unusual at all.
this morning, my boyfriend and i went down the road to get coffee, we went through a drive thru so we did not leave my car the entire time. when i got home, i got a notification on my iphone that an airtag was detected near me - the location of said airtag followed my location from my apartment, to the coffee shop, and back home. 

naturally, i was freaked out, but didn’t want to overreact, so i went out and inspected the entire vehicle, literally inside and out every inch. nothing, no air tag, no magnetic box that could have been holding one, etc. i should also mention, it said i was in range to play the noise from the airtag, i even parked it in a closed garage to listen, and heard nothing. 

i came back in and checked my purse and coat, and nothing, no airtag. 

i called my mom, who lives decently far away from me (and i have a great relationship with her, thankfully), and she was extremely freaked out on my behalf. she immediately came over and also inspected the entire vehicle to no avail. 
so, i took the car for another drive around a big local parking lot - it followed my drive there as well wearing different clothes, no purse, etc. it’s an empty, vacated parking lot with no other traffic or cars at all. 

i then parked in a different location when i returned home, not within a close range of other apartments, and the airtag was still pinging to my parked car. at this point, i was pretty convinced there was an airtag on my car. 

i had my mom take it for a drive, she went out for 15 minutes and got no notification of an airtag on her “find my” app. 

i called local non-emergency law enforcement, they documented the incident, but told me there was nothing they could do.

i called the dealership i bought it from (they’re extremely reputable and well known), and they were shocked. they said they had never heard of this happening, and would be happy to help me search. 

so, i drove the car back to the dealership. they IMMEDIATELY had over 10 people just tearing my car apart down to the engine bay, inside every mirror, even down to the spare tire in the back. nothing. they found no airtag. this is a make specific dealer, so they know this vehicle inside and out, and found nothing. also to note, as soon as i left my apartments lot, the airtag stopped pinging to my location for the first time all morning. it didn’t follow me to the dealership. 

they also drove it for 15 minutes only with my key, and got no notification of an airtag.

so, i thought it was over, i thought it was strange and weird, but maybe some kind of coincidence that someone in my complex took the exact same coffee route at the exact same time as me this morning. but the other drive to a vacated parking lot was inexplicable. (the coffee run was too, as i saw the person behind me in the drive thru and they do not live at my complex, plus, nobody followed me out of my complex.) 

however, when i got home and parked, as soon as i got into my apartment, the airtag was pinging to where my vehicle was parked again. 

i really cannot explain this. the fact that the airtag followed me on two separate drives this morning is beyond bizarre, it also followed me from moving parking spot to parking spot (literally, red pinned dots on the map of where my car stopped to park). 

i need advice, thoughts, input?

A bit of context:
I (26F) have been together with my (32M) boyfriend for about a year now. Everything is going mostly great and he even came to my home country to meet my family and is making a lot of effort to learn my native language to better communicate with my family in the future. He went back a few weeks before me to be with his family for Christmas, so we are conducting temporary long distance relation ship (4-5 weeks) until I get back in his country as I work there. It shouldn't be a problem.

Before I met my boyfriend, he was in a 9 years relationship with another woman (F32) and they were married for two of those years. I met him through a common hobby of ours during his divorce and we got close. He assured me he had no feelings for his ex-wife anymore and she doesn't have any feeling for him either and even got together with a close friend of theirs and even moved in with him this year. They have no children and the divorce went very smoothly and was good on both side. They want to stay friends and they see each other through the same hobby I do and where I met him.

Now, for my side, I haven't had this long a relation ship. The longest I had was my last relationship which lasted 3 years and I found out the guy cheated on me with an ex of his and left me to go back with her. This made it hard for me to trust a guy staying friend with his ex, but I am trying to work on this aspect. This is something I have clearly communicated with my boyfriend, he is aware of this and said he was ready to help me and do everything necessary for me to feel secure with him and his friendship with his ex-wife.
It led to a few rocky  beginnings during our relationship: we would be on a date and he'd answer her phone call as soon as she called. When I told him it bothered me, especially because we were on a date, he said he thought it could've been an emergency or something and he somehow still felt responsible for her in certain ways. I told him that he was not, and if it was an emergency she would probably call more than once, leave a message or leave a text if he didn't answer. Also, she has a boyfriend so he should be responsible for her emergency and not her ex husband, but since they were together for so long and even married I let it go as: please don't answer if we are on a date.
He then came forward and suggest, so that I can feel secure, he would tell me everytime she called and what they talked about, so I would then be reassured that there's nothing going on.
I accepted and thought that would be the end of it.

After the rocky start, I didn't hear much more about her calling him or anything and I've even interact with her a few time through our shared hobby. She is nice, but I still have some reservation about beeing friends with her.

Then, one day, my boyfriend asked me to check something on his phone, in his messages, and then I saw that they had a call, like a three hours long call, from which I haven't heard. (I didn't snoop, the conversation was the second on the list. I just opened the app, saw her name and the call duration) I asked my boyfriend about it and he said: ""ah we were just talking cause she got a new job and she wanted to share the news and all."" I reminded him he told me he would tell me such things (I don't need the details but: oh hey my ex called, she got a new job just so you know). This happened a few times over the course of this year, with me reminding him that it hurts me since he said he would tell me, and now it basically looks like hes hiding it. (And we are not talking about 5 minutes talks, but each at least one hour and most going up to three hours on the phone together).

Then, one week, I got to his place for the weekend and while I'm cooking he says: ""oh, my ex was there on Tuesday, she wanted to visit her parents and was there too early so asked if she could come by and drink a coffee and I said yes.""
So this bothered me as well, but I put it on the fact that I was just jealous and affected from my previous experience. After all, he told me just like he said he would.
Fast forward a bit and there's always a few instances of her calling him just to talk or discuss life updates. This really bothers me because I get they had a long relationship but can't you share this with your friends and not your ex? I however ended up accepting the fact and not react as hard as I would've, because I am really trying to not be a bad kind of jealous.

Eventually they called a lot less and didn't meet each other really, until tonight, for NYE.

I am still in my home country and we are several hours behind, so much boyfriend got new year celebration first. We called yesterday and he told me he was sick and was most likely not gonna do anything and rest. So what was my surprise when I saw the instagram story of his ex, at his appartement with a lot of friends celebrating? I had wrote to him a message earlier asking what he will be doing/ if he changed his mind for New Year, but he never answered and several hours later I see this.
I feel quite hurt that 1) he never replied to me (might have been already celebrating at this point but still) 2) he was suppose to write to me a happy new year message when he got to midnight, he told me over call he'd do it  and 3) that his ex-wife is there. That he actively invited her over (and granted other friends) but still.

I want to write to him and tell him that it hurts me, but i doubt it'll do anything. Maybe I might even be a bit too controlling with this, so I should let it go.

So am I overreacting with this? I haven't done anything yet, but this somehow feels like a breech of trust, but I don't know, I haven't had the healthiest relationships in the past and I might be overreacting.

Currently, the plan is to arrive in Melbourne -> Tasmania -> Perth. I’m seeking a relatively low key holiday with focus on viewing wildlife and taking in local culture. I’m hoping to stay in walkable areas, rent a bike wherever possible, and hire a car for Tas. Will rent a car in Mel if I have to if public transport/tour operators seem too difficult for getting around–any thoughts on this would be appreciated.

Melbourne (5 days) 

* Thinking of staying in the Fitzroy area (any downsides?)
* Check out local coffee shops and pubs
* Healesville or Moonlit Sanctuary (also have the Dingo Discovery sanctuary in mind)
* Phillip Island (should I stay a night over?)
* Bike tour around the city

Tasmania (5-6 days) - Fly into Launceston -> depart Hobart

* Cradle Mountain (2 days?)
* Deloraine
* Freycinet
* MONA in Hobart

Perth (4 days)

* Rottnest Island (thinking at least 1 overnight)
* Brewery tour in swan valley

I usualy playing games like darksouls and eldenring. Sometimes this games can get frustrating. So for escaping and getting relaxed I was playing some chill games. But I run out of games. So I was looking for new ones and. Normally I was searching in steam but the options was hard to understand sometimes. So I got an idea to ask here. As your experience which cosy games you would like to recomend?



The games I have played are;

Stardew Valley: I couldn't finish it because I lost my save file mid/late-game.

Graveyard Keeper: I quit playing near the endgame.

Palia: I just couldn't get into it.

Traveller's Rest: Much like Palia, I couldn't get into it.

House Flipper: It was fun at first, but the lack of furniture variety became an issue.

Coffee Talk: Got 100% achievements. It was a fun.

Tavern Master: Just like Coffee Talk, I 100% completed this one too. Loved the medieval setting.

Jalopy: Finished it. It was a good ride.

Aviassembly: Recently finished it. I really liked it.

Simple Planes: Still playing it.



I am looking something like stardew valley but all recomendations are accepted. Grinding is fun actually. Also while I play these games, I like to watch some movie/Show on side screen.

In a couple weeks, I will be going on my first MSC cruise aboard the Seaside. I had a few questions to get a better idea of what to pack and what to expect.

\- Are the cruise doors magnetic on the outside? I was on a cruise with carnival a couple weeks ago and saw many people decorate their doors with magnetics and would love to do that on MSC if possible

\- I will be staying on Deck 11, is it generally a quiet deck?

\- How long before the cruise does the activities become available? Currently the daily activities are empty and I don’t know what theme days if any to expect and what I should plan for my day

\- How is MSC generally for solo cruisers? This will be my first solo cruise and selected a 4 day itinerary as an easy entry into solo cruising

\- What is the general vibe of MSC and the Seaside ship? So far I’ve been on two other cruises: a Norwegian and a Carnival. Both cruises were pretty different but fun in their own regards

\- What are the best dining options? Is the main dining room open for lunch on embarkation day usually? Which speciality dining, if any, would be worth treating myself to. I have the alcohol free drink package so any spot recommendations I can get included speciality coffee or nice non-alcoholic drinks would be appreciated.

Yesterday morning when I brushed I felt fine this happened all of a sudden. I was trying to think about what I did differently yesterday and I realized I drank an espresso yesterday afternoon which I don’t usually drink coffee and at a little bit of sour patch kids. The sensitivity only happens when I brush, so when I am eating or just going about my day I don’t feel anything. Why could this be?

1q0oape,https://i.redd.it/5mlktjsg1mag1.jpeg,Nike Pegasus Premium after 100 miles,"Shoe Model & Size:

Nike Pegasus Premium, 11.5 US size. (10.5 UK) 

Fit/Comfort Notes

I can be guaranteed whatever nike shoe I buy a 10.5uk will always fit me. 
These are a very comfortable shoe to put on an even walk around in. 
The build quality is quite good and certainly feels premium. 

Use Case

I ran the Valencia marathon a few weeks ago and following on from that December was about recovery and rebuilding after the marathon. 
I was also going to be travelling after the marathon over the Xmas and new year period so with luggage space tight I opted for this shoe as a easy and long run shoe for my travels which could also double as a causal shoe if needed. 


Distance Ran

Since December 7th I have used this shoe exclusively and have 179km/105 miles in them. 
I've done one Parkrun in them and a variety of runs ranging from 12km to 21km

Reason For Buying

Historically I have been a Nike fan boy and the premium with its full length airpod was something I wanted to try. 
I had seen the reviews which said it was heavy but I thought it could double as a casual shoe if needed. I didn't pay full price for them, I paid €135 for them from sportsshoes.com 

Personal Observations

Without a doubt the materials on this shoe are premium and it is a great looking shoe (IMHO) 
It is a lot of fun when running downhill, you can really feel the bounce from the airpod. However running up hill it's like having two anchors attached to your feet. On the flat I start to feel they get into a rhythm at around 5min/km pace. 
My travelling finishes in a few days and I cannot wait to retire these. 
Honestly they are an absolute joke of a shoe and while I can see what nike were trying to do the execution was woeful. 
I have a house full of shoes and I wish I had brought anything else!! 
These will be fine for a walk through the city on a coffee run but this weekend will be their last outing. 


Comparisons

There is not direct comparison to this shoe, as I'm away from home I'm forced to run in it but the thought crossed my mind more than once to pop into a local shop and buy a pair of evo sl. I have decided to give them a chance and do a decent amount of miles in them. 
Honestly buy this on discount as a lifestyle shoe, don't waste your money thinking you can run in these.

We're a family of three (2 adults, 1 tween) in a HCOL area. Goals are to save and invest more, consume less, and vote with our dollars. We had some crazy low buy wins, and also revealed we're still shopping/spending more often than I thought.

**Amazon**: We let Prime lapse in February and haven't missed it at all. It has been so effective in cutting spending generally and Amazon use specifically. We now carts build up for free shipping and work to shift what we can to other companies.

* In 2024 we had 430 Amazon transactions (\*includes digital orders and when they charge separately for items ordered together)
* In 2025 down to 275 transactions. 
* ***$12,000 LESS SPENT THAN LAST YEAR. HONESTLY WTF!!!!***

**Target**: Aimed to only do pickup orders when we were in the area on a grocery run, as well as shift purchases to other companies. 

* Transactions for 2024: 125  
* Transactions for 2025: 88 
* ***$7,000 LESS THAN LAST YEAR! HOLY CRAP!***

Other goals:

**Kpop**: Bought a handful of things within my rules, then stopped buying albums and merch altogether. 

**Books:** Read 72 books! Cancelled Book of the Month, reduced physical book buying. Followed ebook deals and bought a lot of Kindle books. Eventually stopped following because I was buying too many, just because they were cheap. For 2026 it's all library/Libby for me! 

Board games didn't pose an issue for me in 2025, coffee outings reduced since I stopped drinking coffee and tried to avoid Starbucks. Spending in this area roughly half of 2024.

I'm very encouraged to see all these numbers, for what felt like very little change to our daily lift and habits. Onward to 2026!!!!!

I was meeting up with random older guys from Tinder for sex who were quite rough and I still have the bruises but I enjoyed it at the time and I was masturbating constantly even when it hurt and drinking every day and taking all sorts of drugs. I hardly slept too for that full time which I think just made things even worse. Like I’m not even joking I think I slept like 8 hours for the full 2 and a bit weeks or however long it was but I wasn’t even tired. Last time I felt like this I spent all my money trying to start this stupid beauty business even though everyone told me it was a dumb idea and I ended up making precisely $0. I’m still paying off my credit cards for that.

Ive not been going to college and have fell behind on all my work and have just been sleeping all day and barely eating. My job at a coffee shop fired me a few weeks ago and I don’t even care because I didn’t have the energy to go. I told my manager I was feeling depressed but she said that it wasn’t good enough and I do understand we are busy at this time of year. But I really am depressed. I actually can’t remember the last time I actually ate something and I’m definitely dehydrated af. Like my pee is dark orange but I don’t have the energy to get a bottle of water. My flatmate has brought me sandwiches and water but she’s with her parents now until college starts again in a few weeks

Now I just found out I’m pregnant and I don’t even know who the father is. I fucking hate myself. I ordered some tests online and they are all positive except 1 but I don’t think I peed on it properly. I think my period was last in October at the start but I can’t remember for sure.

1q0o4lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1q0o4lg/quitting_caffeine_seeking_success_stories/,Quitting Caffeine - seeking success stories,"Caffeine has been a terrible habit for me for years. I spend all day drinking one cup of coffee (it's usually finished by 2pm) and feel like it's time to quit. There have been days that I drank it simply because I was very sleepy, but it is mostly a habit for me. Extra, empty calories. Only ever one cup. At most, a double shot from Starbucks every now and again, so I'm not concerned about withdrawals, especially since there's been many days that I actually forget to make the coffee and have no mal effects.



I'm not coming for anyone who lives on coffee- be happy as you are. I'm really just thinking that it might regulate my sleep and hopefully make me less anxious overall. Maybe even give me energy I've never felt before.



For people who actually quit, how do you feel now?

1q0o3y6,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1q0o3y6/dad_has_been_weirdly_misogynistic_towards_me_all/,"Dad has been weirdly misogynistic towards me all the sudden, any idea why?","Hi Reddit! Sorry for how long this post is about to be. For context; I am an older teen girl, I will be an adult in a year and I am about to graduate high school in May! I am an early grad, which means I am getting out of here a year early and starting college very soon. I’m very active in the art scene and in our arts district where we live, my major was even in 2D visual design at my art high school! However, ever since I was 14 I’ve taken a very keen interest in mortuary science and being a trade embalmer, so I am switching it up and I will be going to college for that instead of art. I am the eldest daughter in my family (my mother and father’s first born), my parents divorced after having my younger sister (I do have two other siblings from both my mom and my dad, but they have a separate mom and dad and aren’t important to what is going on at the moment), I live with my mom and they did have split custody—with my mom having majority and I only spend the weekend at my dad’s. Haven’t stayed with my dad since an incident that happened years ago involving him getting very drunk and my mom having to pick my sister and I up.

With that out of the way onto the issue:

I am a very head strong, feminist, with friends of all colors, genders, sexualities, who truly believes that everyone is entitled to equality and all humans should have equal opportunity. The mortuary field is a very male dominated one but is slowing shifting to be more equal which is awesome! I’m glad to be going into a field where I am making a difference and helping women break into the space more. I also love to work out, I love coffee and trying new spots, I also really love trying new food! My dad shares my love for trying new food spots and also my love of creating art, which I really enjoyed bonding with him over! My dad’s grandfather was also a mortician so I thought he would’ve been happy to see me go into a path my family has history with, but I may be wrong. See my family on that side is HEAVILY Mormon, and while a lot of my cousins and aunts/uncles have broken through the cycle, majority have not. My dad is in this weird area where he still believes in Mormonism but literally breaks every single rule they have? I am not Mormon, I drink coffee/tea, wear tank tops and shorter shorts/skirts, have a nostril piercing and my double lobes pierced, haven’t gone to church in years, and I am most definitely not the type who wants to have kids and get married just to stay at home (no shame to stay at home parents at all, just not for me). I think this may be contributing to the crap my dad keeps saying to me such as: making jokes about how women are gold diggers, how women aren’t strong (I quite literally go to the gym and probably have more muscle to fat ratio then him), how women would love the sport curling cause they sweep (haha get it cause we love to clean), and of course the infamous women belong in the kitchen. I’ve always shared a love for baking and cooking, something I also have in common with my dad but it’s making me think that: does he like I do these things because it appeals to the misogynistic views he has of women? And is this why he is so standoffish about the field I want to go into because it doesn’t fit traditional roles?

This has all started very recently, and mind you my dad has three daughters (myself and my 2 younger sisters), could this be him being upset he has no sons? Is he upset he shares characteristics with me simply because I am a girl? He doesn’t direct these jokes at my sisters, just me. He also has gotten very weird about commenting on my clothes and body as well. For instance: when we were in the mall the other day I had a heavy jacket on because its winter, but the mall was very very hot inside. We were walking around and I decided to take my big jacket off in the store, I was wearing a john colt tank underneath as I usually don’t wear long sleeves because I have weird sensory issues and my jacket was enough to keep my warm (just to preface these tanks are pretty modest like most brandy tank tops are, covered my entire torso and has thicker lace straps, and wasnt tight just form fitting—and I was wearing some cute flared jeans from hollister, zero rips as ripped jeans aren’t in style right now and haven’t been for ages it seems). My dad starts absolutely tripping, talking about how I need to put my jacket back on and such, even though my face was visibly red and I was sweaty. He does this a lot and will comment on all my clothes, but I don’t even own anything skimpy or revealing? I just have tanks, cute sweaters, flared jeans, baggy jeans, a LOT of graphic tees, some general stuff that fits to my body but again not tight. I don’t wear ripped stuff or anything remotely inappropriately revealing for my age. In fact a lot of my clothes I wear are unisex and I pass old clothes down to both my youngest sister AND my little brother. I have no clue where his weird behavior towards me is coming from at all, it’s making me feel as if my dad doesn’t love me or looks at me in a weird way and I am heavily uncomfortable.

If you guys can offer me advice or guidance I would really appreciate it, I’m going to be moving for college in a year and a half all the way across the country so I won’t have to deal with him soon. But I just want an explanation or possible one. Thank you so much Reddit.

Only problem was getting info from one into the other.  

Played around with claude.ai to get the following script.  It's set to run on localhost but should work for a remote install.  Right now you have to manually download the my-spools.json from the website and place it in the same folder, but maybe one day I'll figure out how to automate that.  

My only use case is importing the manufacturer and filament data from 3dFP, individual filament rolls are still managed in spoolman.  I also don't do multi-pack/color rolls so I'm not sure how it would handle that.  If you end up using it, let me know any errors you might run into or improvements that could be done.

1q0nxfj,https://youtube.com/watch?v=k0EZrel25Qk&si=UMQ4gxz0dV0bR5-z,Oatmeal Raisin Cookies! 🍪,"**Ingredients:**

* Raisins — 1½ cups 
* Flour — 2 cups 
* Sugar — 2 cups (half white sugar, half brown sugar) 
* Eggs — 2 
* Rolled oats (oat flakes) — 3 cups 
* Unsalted butter — 2 sticks 
* Baking powder — 1 teaspoon 
* Cinnamon powder — 1 teaspoon 
* Vanilla — 1 teaspoon 
* Salt — ½ teaspoon 
* Baking soda — ½ teaspoon

  
**Recipe:**  
So I baked this super easy oatmeal‑raisin cookie recipe, and honestly it slaps. You just mix together all the dry stuff first — 2 cups flour, 1½ cups raisins, 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar (or just use 2 cups white if that’s all you’ve got or less/more depending on your taste), 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, ½ tsp salt, and ½ tsp baking soda. Then in another bowl you cream a cup of softened butter with 2 eggs and the sugars, mix it well, and add the dry ingredients without over‑mixing so the dough doesn’t get tough. After that you fold in 2 cups of oats and the raisins until everything comes together. Roll the dough into little balls, give them a tiny press with a spoon, and bake at 350°F (180°C) for about 20–30 minutes, depending on your oven. They come out golden, crunchy on the edges, soft inside — perfect with tea (if you're a tea person) or coffee. You can even swap in walnuts or mix them with the raisins if you’re feeling fancy.

Hope y'all give it a try and let me know if you like it or have any feedback for me.  Happy Holidays and wishing you all the best in 2026.",3,1767216599.0,FoodVideoPorn,2,1.0,False

i started this position a little over a year ago and have cycled through two different sets of managers & most of our staff. theres only 2 baristas that i started with from the first team of about 13.

has anyone noticed a trend of abnormally poor work-ethic? like there’s a fundamental misunderstanding about universal job expectations and managerial hierarchy? there’s been a continuous pattern of my delegations, corrections, advice, training, etc getting straight up ignored. things that are inconsequential to functional operations are turned into disrespect. 

for example, one of my managers had changed the trash bag during a closing shift. a very *very* new barista then scolded him for doing it wrong, demanding he redo it his way. this same barista absolutely refuses to take direction to use a smaller pitcher for steaming cappuccino/flat white milks and won’t regularly purge the steam wands despite being informed of the damage it could cause the machine. during closing (which i rarely do as an early-bird), i’ve had multiple ex-employees who don’t take direction, citing that there’s a “particular order that they do tasks,” despite my needing it to be done then + there so i can continue closing in a timely manner. 

the excess taking of (already paid & generous) breaks, the borderline stealing of food, the refusal to double check or ask about a recipe & just winging it, the using airpods behind the bar to the point where they can’t hear anyone else, the tardiness. it’s actually maddening. especially when our team is exceptionally lenient compared to my other workplaces. 

i don’t remember it being like this at my first two cafes or any of my other jobs outside of the coffee industry. is this a pattern of behavior you’ve noticed in new hires? for reference, i’m located east coast usa.

It seems on the left, there is quite a bit of discussion on this topic. I recently met up with a socialist friend of mine and we got into a small ideological argument about this topic over coffee, which I didn’t really have the most education on.

She suggested that socialists should never be in solidarity of a regime which is oppressing queer folk, women and other minority groups. She suggested places like Russia, Burkina Faso, even the USSR post-criminalization, as well as several conservative, formerly colonized nations like Nigeria or Kenya.

This got me into wanting to read up on this topic, and I’ve noticed a lot of people online tend to say that the things she stood for would be chauvinism. They provide examples like: Western colonizers enforced these reactions on the countries, who just culturally retained them post-liberation; These reactionary policies exist because of western imperialism being spearheaded by neoliberal “progressivism” and used as a tool of manufactured consent; and finally that Western socialists have no right to dictate how a formerly colonized nation develops socially.

What are other socialists thoughts on this? I understand this broadly falls into the “1st, 2nd, 3rd campist” trichotomy, but I don’t necessarily view it from a realpolitik perspective like that.",4,1767216281.0,Socialism_101,4,1.0,False

1q0nsd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1q0nsd9/finally_figured_out_what_my_triggers_have_in/,Finally figured out what my triggers have in common - they are all vasodilators!,"Background: I have had long covid since August 2023 and just recently figured out why certain things would flare me and others wouldn't. I am about 85% recovered after a covid infection in January 2025 that left me feeling like I was in serious peril for months. Since then my version of long covid has been nervous system dysregulation and dysautonomia with some POTS mixed in there. 

My symptoms did/do include: shortness of breath, muscle twitches, eye issues, cold hands and feet, lightheadedness, extreme anxiety, heart palpitations, brain fog, white tongue, hair loss, head pressure, noise sensitivity, migratory tingling, nerve hyper-excitability, temperature regulation issues, and my teeth chatter 24/7. I don't have severe MCAS and the covid infection in January 2025 switched off my PEM for the most part. I have had fatigue but never had full blown ME/CFS. I will make a separate post about recovery at some point.

I haven't seen vasodilation discussed very much so I wanted to make a post about it. I'm not sure how many people this will apply to but I wanted to share my epiphany in case it even helps one person.  

The Conundrum: I would flare randomly all the time. I thought I might have a weird version of MCAS but it didn't make sense because I could eat many of the foods that others could not, such as fermented foods, and feel totally fine. 

  
When I would flare after consuming certain things I felt terrible. Anxiety without thoughts that would cause it, cold hands and feet, lightheadedness, pressure in my head, and very much feeling like I wanted to crawl out of my skin. I couldn't figure out why some days I felt fine and others had me feeling like I was going to die. 

  
Things I react to: magnesium (the largest offender), chocolate, polyphenols, K2, CBD, coffee, botox (got some before I knew I had long covid and almost passed out the next day), heat, dehydration, and larger doses of certain supplements. Oxidative/redox sensitivity can amplify flares but for me this is not the main trigger. Unfortunately ""relaxing"" or laying down when I was flared would make me feel worse.   

  
I thought I was reacting to things that were stimulating but I could take my Adderall with no issue so I was very confused and so were my doctors. I use AI to work on ideas to talk to my doctors about and in doing so it finally made the connection that everything I flare the worst from are all vasodilators. I know a lot of people are against AI but it can be super helpful given you use it in the right way and not as a replacement for your doctor(s). It hallucinates and gets things wrong, I know, this post is not to argue the merits of AI. I mention it because it did help me figure out this very important trigger that now allows me to control how I feel most days. 

  
If you can relate to this post at all I encourage you to look into categories of vasodilators as it relates to your food, supplements, medicines, and habits (heat being the primary one here) to see if you find a correlation to what makes you flare. Also, the body constantly adjusts vascular tone (how tight or relaxed the blood vessels are) based on oxygen needs, CO2 levels, temperature, stress, neurotransmitters, and immune signaling. 

Things that help: salt, walking regularly (as I don't have PEM anymore), and GABA/glutamate balancers. 

Vasodilators aren't bad, for a healthy body they are usually a good thing. After covid though, things that relax blood vessels can cause blood pressure drops, blood pooling, and reflexive ""panic"" feeling. My hypothesis is that I have altered vascular tone regulation/signaling. I don't think this is because I'm damaged goods now, I think it's that my nervous system reacts disproportionately to the signals and small shifts are interpreted like catastrophes. I am doing nervous system training to calm this response. 

TL;DR: Vasodilators are my main trigger for flares. Avoiding stacking them or large doses of them, increasing GABA, walking, nervous system training, and salt are helpful in keeping my system calm as I believe this is just an overreaction to signals. ",27,1767216196.0,covidlonghaulers,16,1.0,False

1q0nqog,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaLuxeCafe/comments/1q0nqog/strength_setting_and_espresso_volume_consistency/,Strength setting and espresso volume consistency,"My machine is the 601 version.  
I am trying to improve consistency of espresso amount and reviewing Strength setting.  
So I thought it is responsible for how much water machine pulls through thus influencing the ratio but I did some tests and it's a bit inconsistent:

**Test 1 , brew espresso without coffee grinds:**

I would do this in a row but after each test I would remove the portafilter and let the residual water to drain for a minute until it is no longer dripping.

|Strength|Output (g)|Time from pump start (s)|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|93|19||
|2|61|16||
|2|56|16||
|3|42|14||
|1|76|19||
|1|90|19|On a different day|

You can see that water output is a bit inconsistent even within the same strength levels but still I would say that some water is trapped in portafilter and that accounted for the difference.  
  
**Test 2 , do espressos with consistent variables:**  
In this test I would use the same coffee beans, strength setting and the same grind level  
Grind level: 14  
Strength: 2  
Coffee beans: medium roast, store bought without roasted at date

|Time from pump start (s)|Espresso out (g)|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|27|35||
|25|30||
|27|29||
|27|37||
|25|40|This one felt more bitter (over-extracted?)|
|27|30||

In this case I see a pattern that it outputs closer to 30g but then still jumps to higher numbers sometimes and on other occasion I once got a 20g output with the same variables.  
  
I don't use any special coffee scale, just a regular kitchen scale with 1 gram precision.

Regarding grind level. When I've got the machine I ignored the BA and set grind level to 8 (as I've seen in my friend's machine 701) but that didn't let any water go through on strength 2. I think grinder isn't consistently calibrated for each machine so it's better to think about these levels in relative terms.  
So I've went to 18 and then went down to 12 and switched to strength 1.  
Strength 1 with 12 grind takes longer time \~35-37 seconds and also does more output \~41g  
But still it was a bit inconsistent.

Regarding store bought coffee beans, I know that fresh one is better, I just had a lot of store-bought ones so I am trying those. I hope they do not make such an influence that espresso output can jump between 29 and 40 g.

Regarding tamping, I do tamping twice so I hope I didn't under-tamp.

I like that Strength 2 runs for about 25-27 seconds and output is pretty close to 1:2 even thought more often it's 1:1.66.

So my thinking is currently is that I have couple options to make the output more consistent:

1. Use Strength 1 and Grind 14 to let it run longer but use coffee scale to stop the process manually when the output is 36 g (1:2 ratio)
2. Change to a higher grind size (15) to have a bit more output on Strength 2
3. Use Strength 1 and lower the grind size to 12 so even though it runs longer the output will be limited and hopefully will be closer to 36 g

Ideally I don't want to use scales to stop the brew process manually and I would just adjust the grind size to a specific Strength level so the output is close to 1:2 ratio.  
  
What do you think? Is it possible to have a consistent 1:2 ratio when I adjust all other variables (grind size, strength) for each new coffee beans. Or I should not bother with it and it's better to just set Strength 1 and use scale to stop it manually when the output is at 1:2 ratio?",1,1767216064.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,0,1.0,False

I’m at a point where I have a few possible paths, but each one feels risky in its own way. I’ve thought about opening a coffee shop, investing in a few condos for short-term rentals, or even getting my pilot’s license. The challenge is that every option requires sacrifice and the fear of making the wrong move weighs on me. If I chase my pilot’s license, I risk draining the savings I’d need for a home. If I invest in rentals, I worry the market could outpace me. And the coffee shop idea excites me, but I’ve never worked in one, so I have no idea where to begin.

Typically, my weekends tend to be quite dull, but now my life feels like a thrilling mystery or perhaps something even more perilous, all thanks to a silly book. I suppose I should start from the beginning and explain how it all began.

On a Saturday morning, the sun was shining brilliantly, and I was feeling a bit restless, so I decided to take a bike ride around my neighborhood.

As I pedaled through the area, lost in thoughts about my belongings and life in general, I felt an inexplicable pull guiding me toward a specific house. I stopped in front of it and noticed a handwritten sign announcing a yard sale.

I never really cared for yard sales; I wasn't like those older folks who spent their free time rummaging through other people's discarded items.

To me, yard sales were merely the leftovers of others' lives, people trying to offload dusty relics that had long lost their appeal.

Yet, something about this particular yard sale caught my attention, prompting me to dismount my bike and venture into the yard to take a look around.

The yard was cluttered with old furniture and tables brimming with various knick-knacks and toys, but I halted when I spotted a box labeled 'books.'

A smile instantly spread across my face; I adored books. Whenever I was without my phone or needed something to occupy my time, I would dive into a book on any subject.

I hurried over to the box, knelt down, and began sifting through it, pulling out faded paperbacks and yellowed hardcovers.

My fingers glided over the spines of the books until one particular volume caught my eye, standing out from the rest.

I picked up the unusual book, feeling its weight in my hands, and quickly noticed how worn and tattered it was; the spine was cracked.

As I opened the book, I saw that the pages were yellowed and brittle with age, filled with handwritten notes and peculiar symbols that seemed to dance before my eyes.

I opened the book and saw that the pages were yellowed and fragile due to age, filled with handwritten notes and peculiar symbols that appeared to dance in front of me.

It seemed that the person who wrote this book took great care to record something significant. At the moment, I didn’t think much of it, but I could sense a strange energy radiating from the book, a kind of chilling pulse that made me shiver.

I closed the book, brushed off the cover, and read the title, which sent another shiver down my spine.

""Prophetic Pages""

I considered tossing the book back into the box and simply walking away, but it was too captivating to abandon. I couldn't just leave it there, tucked away in a box in someone's yard.

So, with the Prophetic Pages book tucked under my arm, I stood up and approached an older woman who seemed to be managing the yard sale.

I extended the book towards her, and she nodded in acknowledgment before informing me in a raspy voice that it would cost five dollars. Without a second thought, I handed her the cash.

""Be cautious with that book, young man; it's not ordinary,"" the woman warned.

I merely nodded and made my way back to my bike, placing the enigmatic book in the basket before setting off towards home.

Upon arriving home, I parked my bike beside the house, took the Prophetic Pages book, and entered the house.

I went upstairs, not particularly concerned about my family, and shut myself in my room, settling into my reading chair, eager to delve deeper into my discovery.

This intriguing Prophetic Pages had piqued my interest, and I was ready to immerse myself in its narrative and pages filled with wonder.

As I began to flip through the pages, I quickly noticed that each one contained a detailed entry about an individual's life and death, and their names struck me as oddly familiar.

I suddenly realized that the names in this book belonged to people I knew—friends, family, even acquaintances. My hands turned icy, and when I turned to the next page, I nearly hurled the book across the room.

I had stumbled upon a page that appeared different from the rest; its ink was darker, and the writing seemed more urgent. The names and dates listed alongside each entry were accompanied by descriptions.

The first entry appeared to belong to my neighbor, Mr. Thompson.

Mr. Scott Thompson - 63 years old - Passed away from a heart attack on April 12, 2023.

I grimaced, unable to believe what I was seeing. It was far too specific to be mere coincidence.

Then I suddenly remembered that tonight was the night, and I tossed the book aside, pondering its implications. Was Mr. Thompson truly going to die, or was this merely a cruel joke?

In a flash, I understood that I had to warn him about the danger he was in, so I stood up from my reading chair, leaving the book behind. As I reached the threshold of my bedroom, I hesitated.

""Hold on, there’s no way he’ll believe me; he’ll probably think I’m crazy or something along those lines,"" I thought, my breath quickening.

Yet, the thought wouldn’t leave my mind, so I hurried downstairs into the main area, standing by the front door, lost in thoughts of Mr. Thompson.

""William, what are you up to?"" a voice inquired.

I turned around quickly to see my parents in the kitchen, both busy preparing dinner, their expressions showing concern for my unusual behavior.

""I need to go see Mr. Thompson,"" I replied.

""Why? It’s nearly dinner time,"" Dad responded.

A huge lump formed in my throat. What was I supposed to say? That our neighbor was going to have a heart attack tonight, and I discovered this from a book?

""Uh - I need to return something I borrowed from him, and I thought I would give it back tonight,"" I said, grinning nervously.

""You can do it tomorrow because it's too late now, and I'm pretty sure Mr. Thompson doesn't want to be disturbed at this hour,"" Mom replied.

I growled quietly and clenched my fists, but I couldn't voice my frustration because I knew I couldn't argue with my parents about what was supposed to happen.

A few hours later, I lay in bed staring at the ceiling. It was dark in my room, and I couldn't take it anymore. I got out of bed, still in my pajamas, but I slipped on my shoes and dashed out of my bedroom, then out of the house, heading towards Mr. Thompson's place.

I raced down the front steps in the darkness but skidded to a halt when I saw the scene unfolding there.

Bright ambulance lights illuminated the area, and emergency workers were loading a body into the back of the ambulance. I then noticed Mr. Thompson's wife sitting on the porch, crying.

I hurried over to her, bent over with my hands on my knees, breathing heavily. When I looked up, she was staring at me, and despite the darkness, the ambulance lights revealed the tears streaming down her face.

""Mrs. Thompson, what happened?"" I asked.

""It's terrible, William. I got up to use the bathroom, but I couldn't open the door. I tried to wake Scott, but he wouldn't wake up, so I called for help, and they told me he had a heart attack in bed. I can't believe it; he was the healthiest man I ever knew,"" Mrs. Thompson explained.

I instinctively took a step back, realizing that this was exactly what was foretold in the Prophetic Pages. It said Mr. Thompson would die tonight, and it happened just as the book described.

""William, are you okay?"" Mrs. Thompson asked me.

I took another step back, my head pounding, then turned and sprinted back home. I burst through the door to find Mom and Dad standing there, and they didn't look pleased.

""William Johnson, what on earth are you doing up?!"" Mom yelled at me.

I glanced at the front door, recalling what had just occurred, then turned back to my parents. I needed to tell them; I had to let them know.

""Mr. Thompson passed away from a heart attack!"" I exclaimed, gesturing towards the front door.

""Oh my God!"" Dad gasped in disbelief.

I wanted to share the details about the Prophetic Pages book and its contents, but I knew my parents would likely dismiss it as nonsense.

Without uttering another word, Mom and Dad hurried past me and dashed out of the house, seemingly on their way to see Mrs. Thompson.

I simply returned to my room, surveying the dim space and pondering where I had placed that ridiculous book, contemplating whether to burn it or toss it away.

But I decided to postpone that until tomorrow when I had the chance and when Mom and Dad weren't around to catch me in the act. So, I crawled into bed, wondering what would unfold next.

The following morning, I awoke to find the Prophetic Pages resting at the foot of my bed, which left me puzzled. Without saying a word, I picked up the book.

As I began to flip through its pages, my heart raced as I recognized the names of friends from high school, family members, and even acquaintances like Mr. Thompson.

Each page contained a detailed account of a person's death, with dates approaching rapidly. Goosebumps prickled my arms; was this all just a cruel joke?

I attempted to dismiss it as a product of someone's dark imagination, but the more pages I turned, the more dread coiled in my stomach.

Eventually, I became consumed by the book, searching for any means to avert the impending deaths, knowing that if I didn't take action, I would lose everyone I cared about.

I was attempting to reach out to several people to inform them about what might happen to them, but they either ignored me or claimed to be too busy.

Just then, my phone rang, and I glanced down to see it was Ryan, my best friend since elementary school.

""Hey Willy, are you busy?"" he greeted me with a cheerful and carefree tone.

""Uh - not really, but I need to discuss something very important with you,"" I replied, feeling a knot of panic in my throat.

Should I really share the details about the Prophetic Pages book and what occurred with Mr. Thompson? He would probably just laugh or hang up on me immediately.

""Sure, what's going on, dude?"" he inquired.

I fell silent, hesitating as I struggled to find the right words to explain the book that was essentially about death to my best friend.

""Um, just... be cautious, alright? I came across something online that made me worry we might be in danger,"" I said.

""Are you referring to that illness happening in Russia?"" he chuckled, though I could sense the worry seeping into his voice.

""Just promise me you'll take it easy, okay? Don't do anything reckless,"" I snapped back.

""Yeah, alright. I promise,"" he assured me, and I felt a slight sense of relief, though it was short-lived.

I was about to end the call when Ryan mentioned he had a question for me, and since I was already on the line, I figured I might as well hear him out.

""Dude, I'm going to a horror movie showing today and was wondering if you wanted to come along. You probably need a break from whatever's going on in that head of yours,"" Ryan suggested.

""Um - okay, I guess I'll see you there,"" I replied.

After hanging up, I let out a soft sigh and looked down to see the Prophetic Pages book still resting on my lap, now opened to a different page.

Ryan Orangewood - 26 years old - shot in the forehead and robbed on April 15th, 2023.

As soon as I noticed my phone slip from my grasp, I shut the book and picked it up, tossing it across my room and watching it land with a loud thud.

""Oh God no,"" I thought as I rose from the bed.

Without uttering another word, I gathered everything I needed, leaving the book on the floor, and dashed downstairs to tell Mom and Dad everything that had happened.

However, when I reached the lower level of the house, I found it eerily quiet; no one was around. The only thing that caught my eye was a note taped to the front door. I approached it silently, took it down, and read it.

Dear William, I’m sorry, but your father and I had to leave for work early due to an important meeting. We’ll be back by lunchtime. If you decide to go out with a friend or by yourself, please call us. See you later, love Mom.

I didn’t care much for the note, crumpling it up before sprinting out of the house. I hopped on my bike and pedaled away as fast as I could.

A few minutes later, I arrived at the town square, parked my bike in the rack, locked it up, and hurried to the movie theater, hoping Ryan wouldn’t actually be there.

But there he was, leaning against the side of the building, engrossed in his phone. When he noticed me, a smile broke across his face.

""There you are! I was just about to call you and ask what on earth happened to you,"" Ryan remarked.

""I got caught up with something else. Let's just finish this movie so I can head home and wrap up my work,"" I replied, raising my hands in a gesture of exasperation.

I resolved to share everything with Ryan after the movie, once we left the theater. I hoped he would understand, given his love for horror films, and that he wouldn't think I was insane.

A couple of hours later, the movie concluded, and we stood outside the theater. I opened my mouth, ready to explain everything to Ryan, but he quickly silenced me.

""I know you rode your bike here, but let's head to that smoothie shop just a few minutes away. Your bike will be fine, and if it gets stolen, you can hold me responsible,"" Ryan suggested.

Before long, we were strolling down the street in silence, and I let out a soft sigh before clearing my throat.

""Ryan, remember how much I enjoy yard sales and how I love buying things from them?"" I said.

Ryan nodded silently, as he often did when I had something to share, knowing that my words were usually significant.

""At this yard sale, I stumbled upon a box filled with books, and one caught my eye called Prophetic Pages. Initially, I assumed it was just an old, dull read, but it turns out it contains a page that predicts when everyone I care about will die. Just a few days ago, my neighbor, Mr. Thompson, passed away from a heart attack, and his name was listed in the book, along with the exact date of his death, as if it had foreseen it,"" I explained.

""So, is it like a death book or something?"" Ryan inquired.

""I have no idea what it is. There was even a page for you that stated you would get shot in the head and robbed today,"" I replied, my voice tinged with worry.

I anticipated Ryan's reaction, hoping he would show concern or suggest we head home right away, but instead, he burst into laughter as if I had just shared a hilarious joke.

""Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard from you in all our years of friendship,"" Ryan chuckled.

There it was; I knew he wouldn't take me seriously. He was going to mock me and label me as crazy. I regretted mentioning the Prophetic Pages book at all.

As we walked past an alley, a man who appeared older than us suddenly emerged. He wore a white shirt beneath blue overalls and black boots, but what caught my attention was the white mask with black eyeholes and the object he was gripping tightly.

It was a gun, and in that instant, I realized I had to intervene before things escalated.

Before either Ryan or I could react, the man raised the gun and shot Ryan directly in the forehead. I stood frozen, watching in horror as my friend collapsed to the ground, lifeless.

Bystanders nearby gasped in shock and screamed at the unfolding scene, but the man discarded the gun and pounced on Ryan like a wild animal, rifling through his pockets with frantic urgency.

I was astonished that the Prophetic Pages had claimed yet another life; it appeared to have knowledge of all my friends and acquaintances, predicting who would be next.

Before long, days turned into weeks, and I had almost forgotten what had happened to Ryan. However, the Prophetic Pages remained etched in my mind, and I was determined to protect my friends and family.

It wasn't until I stumbled upon a page for my father that I felt an overwhelming urge to scream and tear the Prophetic Pages apart.

Samuel Johnson - 53 years old - dies in car accident on April 30th, 2023

Realizing that this date was less than a week away, I became frantic and desperate to find a way to prevent my Dad's death.

I needed answers, so I began flipping through the book, hoping the Prophetic Pages might offer a solution. That’s when I discovered a name tucked away in the back of the book.

Daniel Roberts - 25 years old - Passed away from loneliness on May 15, 2023  (Still Alive Owned Book Before)

I was astounded; this guy had owned the Prophetic Pages before me, yet he was somehow still alive. I knew I had to find him.

I took out my phone and began searching online, eventually finding an old news forum where Daniel had shared his experiences with the Prophetic Pages. I felt compelled to reach out to him, so I sent Daniel an email, pouring out my heart and hoping against all odds that he would respond.

To my surprise, Daniel replied. He seemed somewhat withdrawn, yet he agreed to meet me at a downtown coffee shop to discuss things.

Gathering all the essentials, I made my way to the coffee shop, arriving early to secure a seat. Anxiety washed over me, and my stomach twisted into knots.

When Daniel Roberts entered the coffee shop, I instantly recognized him from the photo he had sent. He appeared older, with graying hair and a weary expression. However, his eyes were sharp, as if he had witnessed too much in his life.

""I received your email. You're in trouble, aren't you?"" he asked, taking a seat across from me.

I simply nodded my head, then retrieved the Prophetic Pages from my bag, sliding it across the table.

""I discovered this book at a yard sale and... realized it foretold the deaths of my neighbor and friend - both are gone - and all the names I know are listed in there. Can I prevent it?"" I said.

Daniel gazed at me for a long time without uttering a word; his brows were knitted together, and then he let out a soft sigh before meeting my gaze.

""You can't alter what has been inscribed in the Prophetic Pages. I’ve attempted to do so, and it only worsened the situation. The book has its own will. It unveils the truth, but it doesn’t permit you to change it,"" Daniel clarified.

""What should I do then?"" I inquired, my voice filled with desperation, my hands shaking.

""Just accept it; you can’t battle fate, but you can treasure the time you have left with them,"" Daniel replied gently.

I felt my heart plummet, but something in Daniel's eyes indicated he comprehended my suffering.

""You must assist me. How did you survive the Prophetic Pages?"" I implored.

""I learned to let go. The book is indeed a curse, but it also teaches you to value life. You must confront your fear of loss. If you don’t, it will engulf you,"" Daniel's voice remained calm.

His words struck a chord with me, yet they felt like a harsh reality to accept. I couldn’t merely sit back and witness my loved ones perish. I had to discover a way to resist.

We spent hours deliberating over the book, and with each moment that passed, I felt a spark of hope. Daniel recounted his own battles, the sorrow he had faced, and how he had learned to accept the losses he couldn’t avert.

He talked about finding comfort in the memories of those he had lost, and I began to realize that perhaps I had been so preoccupied with trying to alter the future that I had overlooked the present.

When I got home that night, I reopened The Prophetic Pages, my mind buzzing with renewed resolve. I needed to confront the entries, to face the certainty of death with bravery.

I picked up my phone, calling each of my friends and family, not to warn them but to tell them how much they meant to me.

I hung up, feeling a sense of relief washed over me. I reached out to my mother, my sister, and everyone else listed in the book. I expressed my love for them and how much I valued our shared moments.

As the days passed, I felt increasingly lighter, even though the entries still lingered in my mind. The anniversary of my father’s passing was drawing near, and I dedicated every possible moment to being with him.We went fishing, exchanged stories, and I made it a point to convey how much he meant to me.

On April 30th, I sat next to him in the car as we headed out for lunch. A wave of tranquility washed over me, and upon arriving at the restaurant, I took a deep breath.

The Prophetic Pages no longer held power over me; I had come to terms with the potential of loss.

As I stepped out of the car, a surge of panic hit me when I noticed a truck barreling towards us, but I was prepared.

I grabbed my father’s arm, pulling him back just in time. The truck veered off course, crashing into a lamppost instead.

My heart raced, but I realized I had finally made a decision. I chose to fight for those I loved, to face the darkness with light.

Later that evening, I revisited The Prophetic Pages, leafing through the pages one final time.

When I reached the last page, I was astonished to see the writing had disappeared, the names and dates vanishing before my eyes. The burden of the book felt lighter, and I recognized that I had altered my destiny.

I closed the book, enveloped in a sense of peace. Daniel had been correct; I couldn’t battle fate, but I could embrace the life I had and the people I cherished.

I was liberated from the chains of fear, and I had learned to value the prophetic essence of life, treasuring every moment as if it were my last.

As I returned the book to my shelf, I understood I would always remember the lessons it imparted. 

Life is unpredictable, yet within that uncertainty lies the beauty of existence. While death may be unavoidable, love will always prevail.

And with that realization, I felt prepared to confront whatever lay ahead.",2,1767215192.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

As 2026 looms near, it seems utterly absurd to measure life in tidy 12-month increments, hoping against reason that this may be the year to conquer the Everest within.  The coming year will bring what it will, at least much of it based on decisions - some made years ago - whether good decisions or those now seen as hopelessly stupid.

And yet (there is always an ""and yet"") all is not lost, since every year brings a bit more clarity that the journey is far more important than the destination.

 

So I won't be watching a ball drop.  I will avoid any and all renditions of Auld Lang Syne.  I anticipate being asleep (or at least whatever counts as sleep to a 50-something).  There will be no horns to blow or confetti to sweep up.  But feel free to join me early in the morning for a strong cup of coffee.  The 2025 calendar can be summarily thrown away while we look at the clean slate that EVERY morning gives.  And we can look upwards, joining Sisyphus in pushing our own personal boulder up the hill again.  This time ... it will stay up there...

- everything pistachio glaze: I am currently attempting to project pan my body care (last time I purchased was summer SAS) and I am genuinely so sad that this one is gone 😭 such a unique, sweet, nutty scent 
- cozy vanilla almond pocketbac: nothing super special about this one! 
- COOKIE BUTTER TRUFFLE: SUCH a yummy scent. loved!!
- spiced apple toddy: burned this one in my bedroom leading up to christmas. a nice switch up from the many bakery scents I burn around the holidays!!
- tree hut Aurora Nights: paired beautifully with pistachio glaze!! 
- gingham FFM: I only had a couple days worth of this left after I ran out of pistachio glaze so decided to use it up before opening a whole new set of FFM/body wash/body cream. obviously she’s a classic but not really sad to have it out of my collection. can always replace if I want to!
- Dr. Teal’s Eucalyptus & Spearmint lotion: used as a hand cream because it was a mini. This was a gift from my sister probably 4 Christmases ago … I do not love spa scents so probably wouldn’t ever purchase this myself but glad to have used it up!
- praline delight: burned fast but very clean! Nothing super special to write home about but I did enjoy this one.
- eos vanilla cashmere: obviously that girl, I layer her with all of my BBW body creams esp on shaving days for extra moisture. layers beautifully with everything and a forever repurchase 
- tree hut Iced Coffee: not sure why I didn’t just finish this up before as it only had two uses left when I pulled it out of my shelves 😅 but I really love this scent and would definitely repurchase!! I am getting SO close to fully panning all my scrubs! I only have one in the shower and one on my shelf remaining which is crazy!! 
- sugared snickerdoodle: this burned TERRIBLY. So sooty, constantly soaking up wax with paper towels to keep my wicks from drowning, and didn’t throw well. Not sad to see her go unfortunately 
- gingerbread & spice (unsure of brand): this might be the closest a candle has ever come to burning my house down. I’ve never in my life had candle glass get so hot that it melts the label off on its final burn. the wick was collapsing in on itself the whole time I had it and I’m glad it’s done.
- cookie butter truffle pocketbac: the pocketbacs just never smelled as good imo as the other products in the same scent, but this was half empty from last year so again glad to see it used up! ",5,1767214639.0,bathandbodyworks,0,0.86,False

I can't for some reason to get reminders to work.  I came from a Versa 4 which had Alexa on it.  If I said ""remind me at 2 pm to pick up coffee"" I would get a bus and that statement on the watch. It would stay there for a bit unless I cleared it.

It looks like the PW creates a task when I say the same thing to Gemini.  I might get a small buzz at the time requested, but essentially nothing really pops up, I need to scroll down to try and find it which really doesn't suffice.

1q0n516,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1q0n516/have_i_actually_shown_interest_or_should_i_be/,Have I actually shown interest or should I be more direct as a woman?,"I’ve posted about this situation before but I’m at a point where I need to either act or move on, so I’d really appreciate fresh perspectives.

I’m 31F and have lived beside my neighbor (35M) for over two years who I have a big crush on. Early on, I left sweets/card outside his door to introduce myself and a few days later he knocked on my door with chocolates for me. When I invited him for coffee after a few minutes chat he said he’d call another time but never did. Since then, our interactions have been VERY minimal, mostly waving in passing. Once when he was mowing his lawn outside we had a brief chat. He always cuts our shared lawn.

Once I got the idea to ask him for help moving furniture. He was helpful and polite and said to ask him if I needed help in the future but it only took a minute and I got a bit tongued-tied with nerves and although he made small talk I felt I could have been smoother. 

Otherwise our schedules NEVER seem to align. I have not spoke/seen him in months.
I’ve seen him on dating apps on and off over the years. We’ve never matched or interacted (I never liked him as I hoped irl maybe we could interact instead). Once he posted a prompt saying he was looking for a girl who liked painting garden fences, this was during ny painting of the fence after he did his and I felt it was oddly specific and must be aimed at me but then 24 hours later he changed it back to a generic prompt.

I followed him on Instagram; he followed back after some time and watches my stories, but there’s never been direct interaction.
I’m aware that proximity and lack of closure might be making me overthink things. I have been told he is shy and unassuming and I also tend to panic and pull back in real-life interactions, which makes me wonder if this is mutual uncertainty rather than clear disinterest.

Some friends tell me if he was interested he would have made a move by day. But I'm genuinely unsure:

From an outside perspective, have I actually shown interest at all?

Or if he was interested, would he have acted by this point regardless?

The practical issue is that I genuinely NEVER see him in person so unless I message him or interact via a dating app, nothing will change. I have tried to engineer bump into him accidently on purpose moments but I always miss him. 

I’m planning to make a move (or let it go) before an upcoming holiday, so I’d really value grounded advice:

Should a woman in this situation be direct? If I like him on Hinge will I just make it awkward.

Or is this a sign I should accept it’s one-sided and move on?

Thanks in advance, honest perspectives welcome.

i’m not a city worker… so i know very little about any of this (don’t attack me) however i just feel like there could be a better system here?? i go to 7brew quite frequently and the line to canes is CONSTANTLY busy. this doesn’t bother me except there’s a lot of traffic in this area. not to mention they have 2 ordering lanes but are only using 1.

there have been multiple times when i cannot get into the 7brew lane from that side and i don’t mind turning around to go on the other end except that side also has a lot of traffic from the 7brew end, so much so it could start flooding into providence. also there’s people trying to drive on that side to get to other places like shnucks.

i’m not really trying to complain here, cause at the end of the day it doesn’t matter… people get their coffees/lunches, but i feel like maybe there can be an expansion behind that road of some sort?? again i’m not a city worker, so im curious if other people have thoughts on this.",8,1767214349.0,columbiamo,6,0.9,False

1q0n3dd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1q0n3dd/how_to_read_peoples_hidden_intentions_the_dark/,How to Read People's Hidden Intentions: The DARK Psychology That Actually Works,"Spent 6 months diving into behavioral psychology research, reading FBI interrogation manuals, and studying body language experts. Not because I'm paranoid, but because I kept getting blindsided by people. That ""nice"" coworker who smiled while sabotaging my project. The friend who seemed supportive but was secretly jealous. We're taught to take people at face value, but humans are complicated creatures with hidden agendas, unconscious biases, and survival instincts that often conflict with what they say.

Here's the thing though. Most deception isn't even intentional. Our brains are wired to protect our ego, avoid conflict, and maintain social status. So people lie to themselves first, then to you. Understanding this isn't about becoming cynical or manipulative, it's about seeing reality clearly and protecting your energy.

**The baseline disruption technique** is something FBI behavioral analyst Joe Navarro writes about extensively in ""What Every Body Knows"". Before you can spot deception, you need to know someone's normal behavior. Notice how they usually sit, talk, gesture when relaxed. Then watch for changes. When someone's baseline shifts during specific topics, that's your red flag. Their foot starts tapping when discussing money. They touch their neck when mentioning their relationship. These aren't definitive proof of lying, but they're smoke signals worth investigating.

The microexpression window is insanely short, like 1/25th of a second. But it reveals true emotion before the conscious mind can mask it. Paul Ekman's research on this is groundbreaking. You can actually train yourself to catch these fleeting expressions on people's faces. **The Humintell app** is legitimately good for this, it's built on Ekman's research and uses real video clips to teach you how to spot fear, disgust, contempt hiding beneath polite smiles. I've caught myself missing obvious signs before using it. The contempt microexpression (one side lip corner raised) is particularly telling because it signals feelings of superiority or disdain someone's trying to hide.

**Verbal leak detection** changed how I listen to people. Linguist James Pennebaker found that liars use significantly fewer first person pronouns. Instead of ""I didn't take your money"" they'll say ""that money wasn't taken by me"" or ""nobody took it"". They're linguistically distancing themselves from the lie. They also use more negative emotion words and fewer exclusive words like ""except"" or ""but"". His book ""The Secret Life of Pronouns"" is genuinely fascinating, breaks down how the tiniest words reveal massive truths about someone's mental state and intentions. You'll never listen to people the same way.

Watch for **behavioral clusters** not isolated signals. One crossed arm means nothing. But crossed arms plus reduced eye contact plus shortened responses plus physical distancing equals something worth noting. Former CIA officer Marc Salem talks about this in his work on reading people. You're looking for patterns, multiple signals pointing the same direction.

The question technique is powerful. Ask the same question three different ways throughout a conversation. Truthful people stay consistent because they're recalling actual events. Liars have to remember their fabricated story, and details shift slightly each time. Notice contradictions. ""I was home alone"" becomes ""I was home with my roommate"" then ""my roommate was there but in their room"".

**Inverse questioning flips the script entirely**. Instead of asking ""what did you do Friday night"" ask ""what didn't you do Friday night"". Liars prepare for normal questions, not inverted ones. They stumble because they haven't rehearsed that angle. This comes from investigative journalism techniques.

Body blocking behaviors reveal discomfort and hidden disagreement. When someone places objects between you and them during conversation, laptop, coffee cup, their bag, they're subconsciously creating barriers. They might be smiling and nodding but their body is protecting itself. Carol Kinsey Goman's research on body language in business contexts is excellent here.

BeFreed is an AI learning app that pulls from research papers, expert interviews, and books to create personalized audio content tailored to your goals. It's particularly useful for this topic since you can ask it to generate podcasts on reading body language, detecting deception, or understanding social dynamics, all customized to your depth preference (quick 10-minute summary or 40-minute deep dive with examples). The adaptive learning plan evolves based on what you highlight and how you interact with the virtual coach. You can also pick voices that keep you engaged, from deep and authoritative to more conversational tones, which makes absorbing complex psychology research way easier during commutes or workouts.

**The Insight Timer app** has some solid guided meditations on developing observational awareness and reading energy. Sounds woo woo but honestly training yourself to be present and notice subtle shifts in people's energy is half the battle. You pick up on things your conscious mind misses.

Strategic silence makes people uncomfortable enough to fill the void, often revealing more than they intended. Most people can't handle more than 3-4 seconds of silence in conversation. They'll elaborate, overexplain, accidentally expose their real thoughts. Investigators use this constantly.

Watch eyes during recall. Studies show people generally look up and to the left when remembering actual events (accessing visual memory) versus up and to the right when constructing or imagining scenarios. It's not foolproof and varies by person, but combined with other signals it's useful.

Timing of responses matters too. Delayed responses to simple questions suggest mental processing of deception. Immediate defensive reactions to neutral questions signal guilt or anxiety about that topic.

The key is understanding that everyone has hidden intentions to some degree. We're all protecting something, wanting something, hiding something. This isn't about catching people in lies for sport, it's about seeing humans clearly. Knowing when someone's words don't match their energy. Trusting your gut when something feels off because you're picking up signals your conscious mind hasn't processed yet. The goal is informed awareness, not paranoid hypervigilance.",2,1767214232.0,MotivationByDesign,0,1.0,False

1q0n2gy,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKrelationshipadvice/comments/1q0n2gy/how_to_approach_this_situation/,How to approach this situation?,"So I (27M), met this girl (26F) about 4 months ago at a party. We instantly hit it off. The banter, the laughter, the conversations, it was all amazing. That night, she, along with some of my friends got quite drunk and we had an amazing time. The next day, the first thing I did when I woke up was text her something along these lines “I absolutely loved my time with you yesterday and I can’t help but shake the feeling there’s a spark between us. I’d love to have coffee with you sometime”. She replies back saying something like “That’s really sweet and I agree with you, I’m just not in the right mindset to date someone as I only got out of a long term relationship 2 months ago”. This was completely fair and I really appreciated her being honest with me.

Over the next months we ended up becoming really good friends, met up a lot, and it was never weird. It really seemed like a platonic friendship would be possible between us (there was not a single meet where either of us got drunk).

Over the Christmas weekend, we didn’t end up going home due to several reasons, so we along with some friends of ours decided to have a house party. We got really drunk, and the both of us were very flirtatious with each other. It progressed and the both of us ended up hooking up. 

When I woke up at hers I couldn’t help but feel horrible. What could and should have been an amazing friendship is now probably ruined by a drunken night. We texted each other after this saying “It was a mistake” and “Might be better if we keep some space for a while”.

Now that it’s been a few days since then and I’ve gathered my thoughts, I’ve realised I like her more than just a friend. That spark I mentioned earlier never went away and has only gotten brighter. But I’m afraid if I message her too soon, I’ll drive her away. I also don’t want to stay away for too long because she might end up thinking I’m done with the both of us? 

I’m just so confused. My options are basically - swallow my feelings, tell her I wanna go back to being friends and hope everything returns to normal OR tell her how I feel honestly, and hope she feels the same. If she doesn’t, it’s probably the end of our friendship.. have you guys any advice on what I can do?

1q0n0sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1q0n0sd/please_help_me_stay_on_vyvanse/,Please help me stay on Vyvanse :(,"I will try to keep this brief (jk I have ADHD). 32 year old female.

I was diagnosed with ADHD-C in July 2024. Started on 20mg of generic, then moved to 30mg generic after a couple weeks, then after a few months, moved to 30mg Vyvanse which eliminated my side effects from the generic (headaches, jitters, zombie affect). I’ve been on 30mg Vyvanse for about one year with absolutely no complaints. Vyvanse has, without a doubt, saved my life. I won’t get into that here, but I can’t emphasize enough what it has done for me personally, far beyond just treating my ADHD.

This past summer, for whatever reason, 30mg abruptly became ineffective. I would take it as usual every morning, and it felt like it wasn’t doing anything for me. This went on for a couple months, and then I reached out to my doctor who moved me up to 40mg. I took 40mg for four weeks while dealing with debilitating nausea, lack of appetite, diarrhea, and bloating. I didn’t know about the digestive side effects of Vyvanse and thought I was just sick & stressed (I was moving during this time). Once I figured it out, I went back to my doctor who titrated me down to 30mg again. As soon as I went to 30mg, the side effects resolved, and the dose felt effective again. I’ve taken 30mg everyday since (August-ish) and have been doing incredibly well in my day to day life. 

In November, I wanted to go back to doing protein shakes for breakfast. I bought a vegan protein shake mix that I’ve used many times in the past, and drank that every morning with my Vyvanse over the course of a week. By the end of that week I was experiencing the same symptoms I had when I took 40mg in the summer despite not increasing my meds - upwards of 5 bowel movements a day, nausea, and painful cramping in my upper abdomen. Common sense told me that the liquid breakfast wasn’t enough for my digestive system with the meds, and that’s why 30mg started triggering me the way 40mg did? At least this was what I thought.

I stopped the shakes, and went back to eating the same breakfasts I have ALWAYS taken with my 30mg Vyvanse, but I’ve not been able to recover. No matter what I eat with my Vyvanse (an entire chicken breast, eggs, oatmeal, yogurt, banana, or a combination of all things), it leaves me poopy, crampy, refluxy, and miserable. 

So then I figured…my gut needs a rest from the meds, I’ve obviously aggravated it, I’ll take a break from Vyvanse and let things calm down. I took three weeks off Vyvanse all together, cut gluten and dairy out of my diet, focused on whole foods or “IBS friendly” foods and started regularly drinking ginger and peppermint tea to support my digestive system (I already take a really good broad strain probiotic everyday and have for about two years). I dealt with a lot of reflux symptoms during this time too which have been present since starting Vyvanse but not previously disruptive, so I did pick up some Gaviscon and took that as needed. I didn’t get myself back to 100%, but most of the way there where I wasn’t cramping anymore and having one bowel movement a day (which is typical for me). 

Being off Vyvanse was a living hell for myself, my family, and my mental health. So, this past weekend my husband sat me down while I sobbed and told me that my digestive system had recovered enough to try and get back on my Vyvanse. Monday went well. Tuesday went well. But today, the cramping, poops, and nausea have returned and it is so awful. This is where my problem is. 

Why have I become suddenly so intolerant to the medication? Why, even after a three week break, is 30mg causing me such digestive upset, after previously taking it for a year without an issue? What do I need to do differently? Do I need to take a longer break? Do I need to add a PPI? Is that even the issue? Gaviscon does bring some relief, so did Pepto-Bismol. 

For additional info: I have always taken it with a good size breakfast, never on an empty stomach, I don’t drink coffee or consume any caffeine, sodas, etc…relatively healthy diet, probiotics, lots of home-cooked meals. I am a stay at home mom. I have an appointment with my doctor to discuss this next week. He did run some additional tests (Celiac/Lactose) to see if it was something else triggering me and not the meds, and both came back negative.

1q0mzky,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1q0mzky/please_help_me_stay_on_vyvanse/,Please help me stay on Vyvanse :(,"I will try to keep this brief (jk I have ADHD). 32 year old female.

I was diagnosed with ADHD-C in July 2024. Started on 20mg of generic, then moved to 30mg generic after a couple weeks, then after a few months, moved to 30mg Vyvanse which eliminated my side effects from the generic (headaches, jitters, zombie affect). I’ve been on 30mg Vyvanse for about one year with absolutely no complaints. Vyvanse has, without a doubt, saved my life. I won’t get into that here, but I can’t emphasize enough what it has done for me personally, far beyond just treating my ADHD.

This past summer, for whatever reason, 30mg abruptly became ineffective. I would take it as usual every morning, and it felt like it wasn’t doing anything for me. This went on for a couple months, and then I reached out to my doctor who moved me up to 40mg. I took 40mg for four weeks while dealing with debilitating nausea, lack of appetite, diarrhea, and bloating. I didn’t know about the digestive side effects of Vyvanse and thought I was just sick & stressed (I was moving during this time). Once I figured it out, I went back to my doctor who titrated me down to 30mg again. As soon as I went to 30mg, the side effects resolved, and the dose felt effective again. I’ve taken 30mg everyday since (August-ish) and have been doing incredibly well in my day to day life. 

In November, I wanted to go back to doing protein shakes for breakfast. I bought a vegan protein shake mix that I’ve used many times in the past, and drank that every morning with my Vyvanse over the course of a week. By the end of that week I was experiencing the same symptoms I had when I took 40mg in the summer despite not increasing my meds - upwards of 5 bowel movements a day, nausea, and painful cramping in my upper abdomen. Common sense told me that the liquid breakfast wasn’t enough for my digestive system with the meds, and that’s why 30mg started triggering me the way 40mg did? At least this was what I thought.

I stopped the shakes, and went back to eating the same breakfasts I have ALWAYS taken with my 30mg Vyvanse, but I’ve not been able to recover. No matter what I eat with my Vyvanse (an entire chicken breast, eggs, oatmeal, yogurt, banana, or a combination of all things), it leaves me poopy, crampy, refluxy, and miserable. 

So then I figured…my gut needs a rest from the meds, I’ve obviously aggravated it, I’ll take a break from Vyvanse and let things calm down. I took three weeks off Vyvanse all together, cut gluten and dairy out of my diet, focused on whole foods or “IBS friendly” foods and started regularly drinking ginger and peppermint tea to support my digestive system (I already take a really good broad strain probiotic everyday and have for about two years). I dealt with a lot of reflux symptoms during this time too which have been present since starting Vyvanse but not previously disruptive, so I did pick up some Gaviscon and took that as needed. I didn’t get myself back to 100%, but most of the way there where I wasn’t cramping anymore and having one bowel movement a day (which is typical for me). 

Being off Vyvanse was a living hell for myself, my family, and my mental health. So, this past weekend my husband sat me down while I sobbed and told me that my digestive system had recovered enough to try and get back on my Vyvanse. Monday went well. Tuesday went well. But today, the cramping, poops, and nausea have returned and it is so awful. This is where my problem is. 

Why have I become suddenly so intolerant to the medication? Why, even after a three week break, is 30mg causing me such digestive upset, after previously taking it for a year without an issue? What do I need to do differently? Do I need to take a longer break? Do I need to add a PPI? Is that even the issue? Gaviscon does bring some relief, so did Pepto-Bismol. 

For additional info: I have always taken it with a good size breakfast, never on an empty stomach, I don’t drink coffee or consume any caffeine, sodas, etc…relatively healthy diet, probiotics, lots of home-cooked meals. I am a stay at home mom. I have an appointment with my doctor to discuss this next week. He did run some additional tests (Celiac/Lactose) to see if it was something else triggering me and not the meds, and both came back negative.

I went to Rhinebeck for the first time and bought this lilac lace weight yarn. It took me a week to get a cast on that I was happy with and two more days to learn short rows. By last night I was enjoying myself and this morning I kept thinking about how I excited I am to keep working on the shawl and improving my knitting. My fiance took today off and wasn’t paying attention to what our puppy was doing. He says it was only a few minutes but from the yarn on the floor I don’t believe it was a few minutes and I do think the puppy ate some so I am equally concerned about him digesting the yarn. I can’t stop crying. I put the yarn on the coffee table far away from where the puppy can reach it so he must have been really bored and was not being looked after. I am equally as upset at myself as I am at my fiance but what is upsetting me the most is that I now have no interest in making this shawl.

1q0mxy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_dinozawar/comments/1q0mxy5/zizek_on_technofeudalism/,Zizek on technofeudalism,"Ah, my friends, comrades, and perhaps even a few undercover liberals in the audience—let me begin with a little anecdote, as I always do, to lubricate the gears of thought. You know, in the classic film *The Matrix*, Neo swallows the red pill and wakes up in this pod, surrounded by tubes and wires, realizing his entire life was a simulated dream fed by machines extracting his bio-energy. But wait—today, in our so-called digital age, it's not machines harvesting our bodies; it's the Big Tech overlords harvesting our clicks, our data, our very desires. And Yanis Varoufakis, that charming Greek provocateur, calls this ""technofeudalism."" Ha! As if we've escaped capitalism into some medieval revival with Zuckerberg as the new Baron von Facebook, extracting rents from our virtual serfdom.

But let me tell you, from my Hegelian-Lacanian perch—because, of course, everything must pass through the dialectic and the unconscious—technofeudalism is not a break from capitalism; no, it's capitalism's obscene supplement, its dirty little secret that keeps the whole show running. You see, Varoufakis says we've moved from profits to rents, from markets to platforms, where Amazon doesn't sell you things—it owns the marketplace and takes a cut, like a feudal lord demanding tribute from the peasants tilling his land. And now, with AI scaling up, it's all about infrastructure: data centers guzzling water in the deserts, power grids straining under the heat of endless computations, land grabs turning rural wastelands into fortified compute fiefs. ""It is pure infrastructure,"" you say? Precisely! But here's the Žižekian twist: this infrastructure is not just pipes and servers; it's the Real bursting through the symbolic order.

Think about it—Lacan would love this. In capitalism proper, ideology functioned through fantasy: the promise of endless growth, the American Dream where you work hard and climb the ladder. But in technofeudalism, the fantasy is stripped bare; it's no longer hidden. We all know we're serfs—scrolling Instagram, training algorithms with our likes, paying subscription rents to Netflix just to binge-watch our own alienation. Yet we enjoy it! This is jouissance at its purest: the painful pleasure of submission to the platform lords. ""Opt out?"" Ha! Try living without Google Maps or Uber—you become a digital ghost, irrelevant, unemployable. The infrastructure—the clouds, the cables, the cooling towers—becomes the Big Other, demanding our obedience not through coercion but through dependency. It's like Hegel's master-slave dialectic inverted: the slaves (us) build the master's castle, but now the castle is invisible, algorithmic, and it owns our very thoughts.

And don't get me started on ecology—oh, the irony! These tech barons promise utopia through AI, solving climate change with smart grids and predictive models. But to scale their intelligence? They devour the planet: water rights in drought-stricken Arizona, energy from nuclear plants that could power entire cities, all to cool the heat of their computations. Thermodynamics, my friends—it's the ultimate Lacanian Real, the indigestible kernel that no ideology can fully symbolize. Capitalism pretended to conquer nature; technofeudalism reveals the truth: nature conquers back, through entropy and exhaustion. ""It is pure infrastructure,"" indeed—but infrastructure as the symptom of our collective impotence. We build it, we depend on it, and it extracts from us, turning global economies into vassal states begging for access to the cloud.

But wait—is this the end? No, Hegel teaches us that every thesis births its antithesis. The more totalizing this technofeudal realism becomes—the more it colonizes our shared reality, as that melancholic Mark Fisher might say—the more cracks appear. Protests against data centers in Ireland, antitrust suits in Europe, even Musk's own manic tweets betraying the fragility. The system overreaches, and in its excess, we glimpse the possibility of true emancipation—not back to some nostalgic capitalism, but forward to a communism that reclaims the infrastructure for the commons. Imagine: public AIs, democratized data, water and land as collective resources, not feudal holdings.

So, my dear audience, let's not despair in reflexive impotence. Let's analyze, critique, and yes—enjoy the contradictions. Because in the end, as Lacan whispered, the Big Other doesn't exist—it's just a fantasy we sustain. Tear down the platforms, redistribute the rents, and who knows? We might wake up from this matrix, not as isolated pods, but as a collective ready for the next dialectic turn.

Now that it has been revealed that ""the upside down"" (TUD) is merely a bridge between two cosmic locations, thus a wormhole, it's fair to say that TUD isn't a metaphorical Hell.  It's a place that could exist literally anywhere in the universe.  

Starting with that, it's fair to assume that vecna/demogorgons/mindflayer/etc. are all creatures that inhabit whatever other planet is on the other side of the wormhole.  TUD was created for easy access between these two points, and it's clear that Earthlings were never the aggressors in this expedition through space and time.  Earth is essentially being ""absorbed"" by planet B, and is home to all things scary in this show.  

The final showdown will be between the El, Will and the squad.....and the Mindflayer.  At this point I'm convinced that Vecna is a lieutenant of the Mindflayer.  Vecna is the catalyst for a larger and grander plan that he himself did not create.  

This leaves a very large window open for Vecna to betray the Mindflayer, and combine forces with Will, El, and Kali to take on the big-bad.  I'm unsure of how he will be converted over to anti-hero status, and I don't think it's going to be an alliance per-se....but when push comes to shove, and the squad has their backs against the wall....facing sure death....Vecna will swoop in and save the day, giving the kids the opportunity to strike or escape.  This will more than likely result in Vecna's/Henry's death scene.  It will be a brief redemption arc.  He will have paid his dues, and somehow we are going to feel pity for Vecna in the end.  

As for the squad.  I don't think anybody is safe besides Max.  The only reason I say Max is, there's literally no reason to kill her off now if they weren't going to do it already.  She's been rendered almost useless, aside from moral support.  Here is a brief list of the characters and what I think their fates will be. 

***Any of these could happen, not necessarily all of them, possibly multiple, though;***

**Eleven** \- Likely dies.  Sacrifice to prevent the spread of her blood to others.  
**Steve** \- We will riot if he dies.  Extremely unpopular option.  Would create a lot of buzz, though.  
**Robin** \- Ditto to Steve.  Might die doing something heroic to save Will.    
**Dustin** \- Would also be a very unpopular option with viewers, but the ""you die, I die."" pact with Steve?  
**Mike** \- Not as likely of a death, but possibly sacrifices himself to give Eleven the advantage to finish the job.    
**Will** \- Seems too obvious that he's on the chopping block.  Although, after a close scare, I think he survives in the end.  
**Lucas** \- I will also riot if he dies.  Seems unlikely, but you can't count him out.   
**Hopper** \- Somewhat likely to die.  He seems very ready and willing to blow himself up if it means saving the crew.  I also find it funny the keep showing us that dynamite pack.  I think this is more than just a coincidence.    
**Nancy** \- Will live to tell the story, and go on to make a successful career in investigative journalism.  
**Jonathan** \- Also survives, marries Nancy.  I think the whole Byers family could very well survive this ordeal.    
**Joyce** \- Might die along side Hopper.  Could very likely survive, though.  
**Murray** \- Somewhat likely to die.  Sacrificing himself to save somebody.  

  
The end will be a fast forward to 3 or 4 years later, whoever remains will be the central focus of the last 5-10 minutes of the show.  Hawkins might be gone, but they will be settled in a new area not far away.  If it's Hopper who survives, the ending might be a shot of him drinking a coffee or a beer on his front porch.  Taking in the moment.  A close up shot of his face with a blurred background, where he smirks, turns around and walks into his cabin.  On the front porch the camera slowly starts to come into focus, and there's a box of eggos sitting on the patio table.

All the bread, pastries, bagels etc will be made on site and the site we are looking at is quite open plan (which is something I want, I want customers to be able to see where the goods are made. Think rock shops near the coast).

Now, obviously, I have a responsibility when it comes to allergens. I’m clear on the law around this. We are not planning on offering gluten-free bread but we are planning on offering items that are naturally gluten free (coffee etc). 

From my experience in hospitality, we are sure to get an even few gluten-free customers try to make purchase (even though it will obviously be a fresh bread bakery). My problem is that the site will be swimming in flour, people with particularly bad allergies can react from it being in the air which it absolutely will be. So I’m planning on putting a massive sign up saying (words to effect) ‘we refuse to serve any one with any gluten allergy/intolerance or celiac’s disease’. It will probably be written in a slightly tongue in cheek/ sarcastic manner as is the British way.

However, a mate (reliable source, I know /s) theorised that an allergy could be classed as a disability and as such my blanket refusal of service (of any item, containing gluten or not) could be based on a protected characteristic and open me up to a whole world of problems.

TLDR: is a food allergy a disability? And could a blanket refusal be classed as discrimination?

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. :)

EDIT: It was not my intent to cause offence with the sign. The comments have made me realise that a sarcastic sign could come across as making light of something that does genuinely affect people’s lives. Again this was not my intent, the idea was to brighten an otherwise ‘boring’ sign but I apologise for any offence caused. If I use it, the sign will only be factual and will not be sarcastic or tongue in cheek. Thank you for all your input, it has been genuinely valuable.

Is he selfish?","I'm 30 and dating someone (on and off for 3 years) who confuses me a lot. On paper, he can be generous. For example, for Christmas he gave me about $80 worth of gifts, but they're not stuff I asked for (some items are OK, like tea/coffee). But in day to day dating, his behavior feels passive aggressive and transactional in a way that’s starting to really bother me.

Most of our hangouts are initiated by him. If he asks to meet and I say I’d like to go to Starbucks, he won't say ""sure"" and then keep asking where we’re meeting multiple times. I get the strong sense he’s hoping I’ll eventually suggest somewhere else. If I stick to Starbucks, he’ll show his displeasure by already having ordered his drink by the time I arrive, even when I’m not late, and then I go up and order my drink alone while he's sitting, which makes me feel awkward and like I’m being punished for my choice.

For Christmas, he gave me a bunch of ground coffee - which is probably to tell me to start drinking coffee at home (WHICH I DO, I only go to Starbucks 2-3 times a month!).

The same pattern shows up with restaurants. He hates anywhere that isn’t all you can eat, something I later learned is a big family preference. I hate AYCE places because I don't have a big appetite and prefer quality over quantity. If I want to go to a specific restaurant, he’ll still come, but suddenly he can’t drive, even if he initially offered. That day it’s always that his parents or siblings “have the cars.” It feels like quiet retaliation rather than an honest conversation.

Money-wise, it’s also uncomfortable. He’ll let the bill sit on the table untouched for a long time until I finally just pay for both of us to break the tension. He doesn’t say anything, just waits. With movies, I noticed a similar thing. Every movie we’ve seen has been one he suggested. He’s never asked what I want to see. This past summer, he asked me to see a movie and suggested a kids movie (Elio?). I countered with the F1 movie, which I really wanted to see. He refused. If it’s a movie he wants to see, he’ll buy my ticket. If it’s not, he’ll either buy only his own or just let me pay.

What messes with my head is that he isn’t consistently cheap or ungenerous. He just seems generous when it aligns with what he already wants. When it doesn’t, he becomes passive aggressive instead of communicating directly. I’m starting to feel like my preferences are an inconvenience and that I’m being subtly trained to default to what he wants (so now, I don't even initiate dates with him).

I now feel uncomfortable by this pattern, even though he does show generosity in other ways. I've known this guy since we were teenagers (childhood neighbors) and he used to actually do what I want. Is this now a real red flag about control, resentment, or incompatibility that I shouldn’t ignore?

2. Once I reached out to WestJet/Sunwing they told me to talk with the agent at the reception. I went to talk with them on the time that they are here every day (2 until 3:30pm) and they “registered” the complaint and gave me the option to upgrade to another hotel 4 star if I would pay more.
3. The food - day 3 into my stay, I got really sick. I spent 2 days at the room going to the washroom and only eating bread and drinking water. The food of the buffet never changes and it’s for sure not fresh. All the food is reused and extremely low quality. 
4. The drinks - all the drinks are made with powders - even you “cola” it’s just sink water mixed with a cola powder. The only real drinks are rum and beer, and the coffee is good.
5. The facility - well the picture shows it all: the room is very old, discussing mattress, the “jacuzzis” are all empty and don’t work.
6. The beach and the sand - best I ever seen! Absolutely stunning. However I was sick for 4 days out of 7 so could not really enjoy it.

We literally just got to Sierra Vista today. I am wondering if anyone knows anyone that can help my son move in a couple mattresses and a few other heavier things (couch, coffee table, boxes). 

I do not need a company to do it. We got it in, we can get it out. Just maybe an hour of someone's time to help my son move in a couple of the bulkier things. I am also not expecting this to be charity.

1q0mp1y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0mp1y,A look back at 2025,"Happy New Year everyone!! While it's not 2026 (yet) where I'm from I want to take a look back at 2025, as it feels fitting to look ahead while reflecting on the past year and to summarise everything that has happened. 

2025 was a one wild roller coaster for us theloises but right out the gate, we got Eloise content for season 4 and Claudia and Calam giving us two iconic roles, gracing our silver streams with their presence ❤ 
Calam as Tom Fowle in Miss Austen 
Claudia as Maggie in Toxic Town
Both are shows I highly recommend and both are fantastic in it really showcasing their range. We continued 2025 with the ongoing s4 shoot and kept our eyes and ears peeled 👀 
But Calam decided to surprise us with him joining the cast of Ride or Die, an upcoming action comedy series, and not just a small role but as a lead character😉. We don't have any information about his character (yet) but I expect to see the show coming to Amazon Prime in Spring of 2026.
As the season 4 shoot progressed, we were busy with theories, posts and watching the production closely, by Spring of 2025 we got the Bridgerton renewal announcement for season 5 and 6 👏. 
We had a Calam (and the cast of what it feels like for a girl)  and Nicola collaboration with the release of a t-shirt supporting trans rights and all profits going to the Not a phase charity  💜 
But we cannot forget our Theloise week 2025 which was celebrated in various ways here on Reddit and on A03, with amazing headcanons, fanfictions, edits and fanart 💙 📚 
May graced us with the wrap on Bridgerton s4 and the madness started but we held our ground 👏 
Summer graced us with the release of Calam's series What it feels like for a girl (another show I highly recommend) showing us a new side of Calam and gave us some iconic interviews, Calam being our green flag through and through with supporting countless charities and the lgbtq+ community, an amazing and flirtatious duo was born with Ellis (Howard) and Calam rigorously commenting on each others Instagram posts. 
But of course we can't forget Claudia who decided to surprise us with the announcement of staring in the short film Wegwerf, a movie directed by her boyfriend and Claudia's residential coffee maker Cole Edwards 😄 and not only that but the movie stars Claudia's previous co star Sorcha Cusack aka Calam's aunt. Oh they do love to feed us 😏 .

Summer went by and Calam decided to surprise us by being active but just as we thought we'd seen the last of him, he said ha you thought, and gave us personalised theloise and What it feels like for a girl merch with all profits going to the charities Choose love and Not a phase and had all of our jaws dropping to the floor. And of course the start of shooting Sweetpea season 2 which will give us our resident lover boy 👻 back.  And ofc Calam's appearance at London fashion week 💅 

Autumn was a long season for us filled with some uncertainties and countless posts alongside some frustration but we celebrated our Scorpios ♏ and we finally got some Bridgerton news alongside the release dates for the upcoming season. 
Claudia decided to drop one steamy audiobook on us and made me go feral with her voice 😍 
Meanwhile our favourite 6'2 ft Irish man decided read an amazing irish play for theaidsproject ❤ 
Calam decided to surprise us once again by following Victor (John Stirling) and we all went crazy. But of course it wouldn't be us if we didn't get Claudia content soon after, with our favourite Birmingham girl gracing the court of Glass magazine sending us all into cardiac arrest ❤ 
December gave us more promo, and finally a trailer for the upcoming season and our first look at Eloise (after a long drought) 🙌 😍.

I can't wait to see what's in store for us in 2026!!! Hang in tight it's gonna be a wild ride 😏. 
I want to thank all of our members, all of us who joined the sub and are keeping it alive, all the editors, the theorists, the writers, the artists, the theloise lurkers on here for making this year a fun one 😉 here's to 2026 and the return of our favourite couple! 🎆

1q0mn1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuditaKompakt/comments/1q0mn1f/a_comprehensive_list_of_must_have_apps_and_games/,A comprehensive list of must have apps and games,"I love supporting unique phones because the current landscape of mobile devices makes me sad. I tested this phone for a week before giving it to my 10 year old daughter. I wanted to understand it first. After using it daily, I found that the usual recommended apps are not the best fit. Nothing against eInkBro, InkOS, or Aurora. I simply want to highlight other resources. Here's a list of apps that I think significantly enhance the Kompakt.

**App Store - F-Droid**  
The F-Droid app store feels so much more on brand for this device. Apps approved for F-Droid are free, open source, and designed to respect you. You can still download Aurora from within F-Droid. But I think F-Droid is a better default.

[F-Droid - Free and Open Source Android App Repository](https://f-droid.org/en/)

**Launcher - Olauncher**  
Olauncher is simple, clean and it resembles launcher on the Light Phone. One of my favorite parts of this launcher is renaming the apps. It even supports using emojis in the app names. My 10 year old loved it! I have the gestures so when I swipe left it brings up the calculator and swiping right brings up the calendar. **\*!!Warning!!\*** If you enable the daily wallpaper, and end up not liking what it chooses, you can't simply disable it and have it return to white. You will need a wallpaper picker or gallery picker to change back to a pure white wallpaper.

**Browser - Via**  
This browser is a lifesaver. It's beautifully simple and lightweight. You can customize the home screen so it's distraction free. It has a reader mode which makes webpages so much easier to navigate on an eink display, and most of all, it has gesture support for mapping volume buttons to scroll for you! Go to Menu > Settings > General > Gestures, to enable volume scrolling.

The one downside is that it's not in the F-droid store so you have to get it direct from the Via site or through Aurora if you go that route. You can still get it from Via's own site and use [Obtanium ](https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.imranr.obtainium.fdroid/)to keep it up to date.

**Utility - KeyMapper**  
I love KeyMapper! It makes a world of difference with a display like this. It's fairly intuitive and the open nature of the Mudita makes it very compatible. It walks you through all of the options. My recommendation is if you're using any kind of music app, map a double tap of the back button as media track backwards, double tap the home button as track forward, and a long hold on home to pause/play. Then I mapped a long hold on back to flashlight. You can also opt to do those same media controls as a long hold of volume up, long hold of volume down, and simultaneous key press of both volume keys to pause/play. It won't work when the phone is completely locked, but it will work from the lock screen without having to unlock the phone.

You can mess with the settings key, but it had some unexpected results. It's something to do with there not really being a notification center on the Kompakt. So your mileage may vary on that button as they say.

**Games - Antimine, Dots'n'Boxes, Black No Sugar**  
I have found three simple games that are a lot of fun without being too distracting.

Antimime - A minesweeper remake. It has a theme setting which will let you make the game look a lot nicer on this display. The one setting that is a must is change the box to the one in the lower right. Pictured below.

Dots'n'Boxes - This is a game I used to play with my siblings in church on paper. It's a straightforward game. Just put your lines in place until one of you is forced to put three sides on a box. It can be played against a computer or with a real life friend.

[Dots'n'Boxes | F-Droid - Free and Open Source Android App Repository](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.stefan_oltmann.kaesekaestchen/)

Black No Sugar - This little app was kind of a rare find! It's based on the old game and watch devices. There's definitely going to be the expected input lag, but the animations are blinks designed for this type of display and it's actually a ton of fun. I got it on [itch.io](http://itch.io) where you can actually find several web versions of similar game and watch games. This was one of the few ported to be a native android app.

1q0mmz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1q0mmz6/something_told_me_not_to_leave_my_apartment_i/,Something Told Me Not to Leave My Apartment. I Should Have Listened.,"I didn't go to work that day.  Not because I was sick, or for the simple act of playing hooky; no, it was something else.  Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.  My doom sense was tingling.  It might sound silly, but let me explain.  

Growing up, my mother would occasionally have days that she would refuse to leave the house.  If asked, she would tell you that something bad was going to happen if she got dressed and walked out the door, even if it was just to get the mail.  That was her doom sense, a deep seated feeling in the pit of her stomach that portended some unseen calamity just beyond the boundary of the walls.  As a kid, I would laugh at the ridiculousness of the idea; Mom's off her rocker today, she thinks she's going to die if she touches grass. It was easy to shrug it off because it was just one of many superstitions in a cup that was practically overflowing on the table, staining the carpet with a million little idioms and axioms.  Many of them, I'm sure you are familiar with; don't step on cracks, always toss a pinch of salt over your shoulder should a single renegade grain miss the plate and land on the counter, never pick up a penny that sits tails side up.  So many absurd rules, so many rituals to observe, it's a wonder she got anything done at all.  But above all else, one rule was to be followed no matter what; when your doom sense starts tingling, you must obey. Like a lot of lessons that can only be learned the hard way, it was funny until it wasn't; sometimes I think I'm lucky that I was ever able to laugh again. 

But, I don't like to dwell on that.  Life goes on, and it's easy to write off the things that happen to a child as exaggerated, or entirely mythologized.  When you're eleven, everything is big, and the world is always ending.  It's hard to distinguish random chance from preordained fate.  As an adult, I would tell myself that I didn't believe in such flights of fantasy.  The loudest voice in my head was always quick to rationalize; sometimes, bad things just happen, and there's nothing to blame but happenstance. I think I always knew that was bullshit.  I didn't go to work that day, or any day after, because I knew that something terrible was waiting for me.  Destiny, fate, fantasy, whatever name makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside, I know it for what it was; the truth.  

My alarm went off at 6:45 am just like it always did, and I got out of bed with the same sleep inertia that rested on my shoulders since the day I turned 30.  I didn't know it then, but to be fair, I barely knew my name before the first stream of hot water hit my back as I took my morning shower.  No, I got all the way through the grooming process, past a cup of Kroger coffee and a plate of scrambled eggs, all the way to the moment my hand touched the doorknob when it hit me.  Only hit isn't the right word.  Really, it is more akin to having your body filled with ice cold water.  A sharp chill runs down your spine, as your stomach clenches and drops, and your feet feel as though they weigh a thousand pounds each. Were there goosebumps?  Maybe, it was hard to tell for sure on top of everything else.  The world had stopped around me, as something in my mind let out a panicked hiss.

DON'T.  

I tried to shake the thought and turn the knob anyway

STOP.

My stomach dropped a second time and my hand froze in place.

WRONG. SOMETHING IS WRONG.

Before I knew what I was doing, I had backed down the hallway into my kitchen. The rational voice in my head was already making a fuss.

“What the fuck are you doing?  You're going to be late for work, and for what? A random bout of anxiety?”

Maybe it was right, maybe I was just having a moment, but it was one hell of a moment to be sure.  I buried that rational voice that screamed of write ups and lost wages and walked back to the coffee maker.  I told myself that another cup of coffee was exactly what I needed, and then I would hit the road.  As I pulled the pot from its cradle, I was alarmed to see my hands were shaking.  The great knot in my stomach had loosened a bit, but my nerves must have still been a little frayed.  I poured another cup, sprinkling the counter with little drops of java as the pot writhed in my hand.  I promised to clean those up when I got home, when I didn't have somewhere to be.  

Those drops are still there as I write this.  After slamming my second cup of coffee, the shakes simmered down into a dull tremble.  I looked at the clock on my stove, and saw that it read 8:30.  I couldn't remember if the clock was two minutes fast or two minutes slow, but it hardly mattered; with traffic, I was going to be late regardless. The rational voice piped back up just then, striking the tone of a disappointed mother, chastising me for my silliness.  

“What are you waiting for now?  Time to get going, idiot.”

It was right again.  I set the cup down and headed back to the door, determined to get to the office for my daily 200 bucks.  My hand touched the knob and that weight settled back into my body, but I was expecting it this time.  Before my body could shut down again, I forced my way through the door and into the hallway of the complex, feeling sweat prickle the back of my neck as the cold air of the AC wafted over me.  The heaviness was starting to return to my feet, but I was resolved to keep going.  

“Stop thinking about it, and go!”

I jogged down the hallway to the elevator, and jabbed a finger at the button.  The chime had been broken for months, but the down arrow flashed its usual faded yellow glow.  So far, so good.  A moment later, the doors parted in with a rusty groan and a dull thud, revealing the smudged stainless walls and outdated carpet of the elevator.  I put one foot over the threshold when another wave of anxiety washed over me.

TURN AROUND.  GO HOME NOW.

“Don't be stupid, get in the elevator!”

Conflicting voices now, fighting for dominance.  It felt like a war in my brain, but all I was trying to do was go to work! I wasn't disarming a bomb, or deciding if someone should be pulled off life support; this was stupid.  So, against the wishes of my body, I stepped into the elevator and rode it from the 4th floor down to the first, and I crossed the lobby with a brisk pace, ignoring the monsoon churning in my gut.  When I reached the double glass doors of the complex and peered out into the wider world outside, I saw… nothing, nothing at all.

The early morning traffic started and stopped in a steady rhythm, and passersby continued to pass on by.  Birds fluttered down the street, oblivious to the wide eyed man gawking at them through an inch thick pane of glass. Everything was completely and utterly normal.  I let out a nervous chuckle, and wiped my brow with the backside of my hand.  Man, I thought, I really worked myself up for nothing.

“Yeah, I've been saying that the whole time, asshole, now get moving.""

“Hey man, are you alright?” The voice came from behind me, at the front desk.  I turned my head a little too quickly to see the desk clerk, Paul, leaning forward with a look of concern set across his brow.  I must have walked right by him without noticing when I was forcing my way through the lobby.  “You've been standing at the door for like five minutes, and pardon my cliches, but you look like you've seen a ghost.” He wiggled his fingers as he said the word “ghost,” as if to reinforce the spookiness.

I shook my head and let out another chuckle.  I liked Paul.  For a glorified doorman, he was surprisingly warm and perceptive.  I shrugged and shoved my hands in my pocket.

“Shit, sorry. Just having a weird morning is all.” I paused for a second, and then added; “must have been that second cup of coffee giving me the jitters.”

Paul let out a hearty “ha” and leaned back in his chair.  “Well then, I need whatever you're drinking, because I'm on my third cup and it's not doing shit!” He produced a paper coffee cup from the desk and shook it lightly.  “Not much excitement here to keep me awake.  Heck, you're the most interesting thing I've seen all morning.”

We both laughed at that, and it felt good. It was good.  We shot the shit for a few more minutes, before I wished him a good shift and turned back to leave. I was feeling a little better after the exchange. The rational voice chided me for stalling, but I took it in stride. With rationality within my grasp once again, I took a shallow breath and pulled against the stainless steel handles of the doors, letting the cold early morning breeze cascade across my face and chill the standing sweat from my absurd little panic attack.  My hands were shaking again, and my insides were still at war with each other, but for a second, I felt good about my decision.  No flights of fantasy, no giving in to those unreasonable fears.  I was not my mother, and if I had a say in it, I never would be.  I threw Paul one last wave, and pushed through.



I stepped out onto the sidewalk, hearing the whoosh of air as the door closed behind me, set against a symphony of idling engines sitting impatiently at the red light. From somewhere in the distance, an ambulance siren was echoing off the buildings. I was outside, and now I just had to round the corner to the lot where my Corolla was parked, no doubt covered in a layer of snow.  I turned to walk, cursing myself for not remembering to put the wipers up before the snow came.  Ten steps down the sidewalk, the siren was much closer, and I could see the lights of the ambulance down the street. I had time to wonder how it was going to get past the gridlock on my street. I paused to watch it approach, the knot in my stomach twisted yet again, and the feeling of cold water spread through my limbs.

DOOM.

A loud screech cut through the air as the ambulance barreled down the south side of the street, heading straight for the standstill traffic. The driver was trying to slam on the brakes to no avail.  The salt trucks had not yet been to my neighborhood, and the road was thick with ice and slush. Even with his foot to the floor, the driver could do nothing to stop what was coming; the vehicle meant for saving lives was about to become an instrument for taking them. As I watched, the ambulance closed the distance at what I would guess was 50 miles per hour, gaining yards every time I blinked. I stood there and stared with a dawning horror of what was about to happen. My stomach dropped into my feet.

“What the fuck are you waiting for? RUN!”

The ambulance swung over the center line and plowed between two sedans at the back of the traffic jam with loud, mechanical crunch, sending both cars careening towards the sidewalk.  A red Ford Focus on the opposite side of the street hit the curb hard and flipped on its side, crushing a man against a wall before he even had time to scream. All at once, the weight in my feet let go, and I was sprinting towards the door of my building.  The ambulance hit the next set of cars; one of them was halfway into the next lane and the unstoppable force crushed the driver side and sent the car spinning into the next car in the line.  The screaming had started by then, a cacophony of fear and agony set against the sickening crack of metal on metal.  The carnage was quickly catching up to me, and I tried to tell myself that I couldn't hear the faint wet squelching under each impact.  I was lying.

I got to the doors and ripped them open, practically diving into the lobby as the ambulance reached the point I would have been standing. Paul was standing at the window, looking out in horror at the situation. He saw me run in and turned to yell something, but I just kept moving.

“What the fuck is going…” He never got a chance to finish that sentence. A man in an SUV was attempting to escape the chaos, and had backed halfway onto the sidewalk when the ambulance smashed through his fender, thrusting the SUV into the southern window of my building. The glass shattered instantly, spraying my back with little pieces of shrapnel. As I reached the elevator, the back half of the SUV was now resting where the sitting area normally was, and Paul was wedged somewhere underneath.  In a panic, I pushed the call button what must have been a hundred times, as I looked across the ruined lobby to the hell that was unfolding outside.  At the front of the intersection, a dump truck idled away in the left lane.  The ambulance, now looking more like a white and red hunk of scrap metal, found its final resting place in the back of that dump truck.  The impact boomed like a strike of lightning landed feet away.  The elevator doors opened behind me just as I watched the ambulance driver crashed through the windshield and break his neck on the steel wall of the truck in front of him. The force of the blow pushed the dump truck into the intersection, where more terrible crunches followed.

There is a weird zen that comes with being in shock. In the movies, when something bad happens and someone goes into shock, you don't really get a chance to know what that person is actually feeling.  As it turns out, it's almost sort of pleasant.  I was in shock when I stepped into the elevator, and the sounds of screaming and glass and metal faded away as the doors slid shut, replaced by the dulcet tones of elevator music.  To this day, I can’t tell you if the music was coming from the elevator or my own head.  I was faintly aware of a stinging sensation in the back of my neck, but beyond that, the lights were on and nobody was home.  The time between getting in the elevator and finding myself curled in a ball on my bed is mostly lost to me. I only came back to earth when my phone started buzzing in my pocket. I pulled it out and answered without looking, the motions just happening automatically.

“Hello?” The voice that came out of my mouth felt foreign to me; it was flat and hollow in the way a hypnotized child would speak.

“Jason, it’s Mark.  It’s going on 10 o’clock, and I don’t see you at your desk.  Your time card shows that you haven’t clocked in either.  Are you coming in today? Because if you’re not, you really needed to let me know beforehand.  Our attendance policy is very clear; minimum two hours notice for any call off, no exception.  I don’t want to write you up, but…” 

Of course it was Mark, Mr. By-The-Book, always crossing his T’s and dotting his I’s, quoting the employee handbook like scripture.  I never liked the guy, and I liked him even less at this moment. I sort of tuned out while he was talking, missing the last few things he said.  I could hear the sound of an approaching helicopter, when a thought occurred to me. 

“Did he say 10 o’clock? Has it really been that long?”

Even the rational voice was incredulous. Mark was still talking, something about points and discipline, when I found a point to interject.  

“There…there was a terrible accident.  Right outside my apartment…I…I almost…” I absentmindedly fumbled for the TV remote and turned the TV on my dresser to the Channel 2 News, and immediately saw an ariel view of my street, complete with all the carnage below. “Turn on the news Mark.  Channel 2.”

“Jason, I don’t see how this has…”

I hung up on him mid sentence and turned my attention to the TV screen, marvelling at the level of destruction that I was almost a part of.  The aerial view of the scene cut away to a news reporter on the street, who was doing her best to be professional despite the horrorshow before her, and mostly succeeding. I turned the volume all the way up, and walked over to the window that overlooked the street, pulling the curtains open as I listened for the grizzly details.  

“First responders are on the scene now, working to free those that are trapped in their cars.  Officers at the scene are unsure of the exact number of casualties, but the death toll is estimated to be at least 10, with at least a dozen others with serious injuries. In total, 20 vehicles were involved in this terrible accident, and rescue operations could stretch well into the afternoon. For Channel 2, this is your fault, Jason.”

I tore myself away from the terrible scene below, and nearly screamed when I heard that. I desperately thumbed at the remote, trying to rewind to see if I heard what I thought I had just heard. I found the button and jumped back 30 seconds, feeling the remote grow sweaty in my hand.  

“...In total, 20 vehicles were involved in this terrible accident, and rescue operations could stretch well into the afternoon. For Channel 2, this is Paola Greyson.”

I didn’t realize I had been holding my breath,and I let it all out in a massive exhale. I felt stupid, believing the news had talked to me directly.  I must have been losing my mind, but who could blame me? I just witnessed the death of god knows how many people, and could have easily died myself if I hadn’t moved when I did. This fact, laid out so bare before me caused my knees to buckle.  In the time since, I hadn’t really processed what happened, and all at once, it crashed over me like a tidal wave.  I fell into my bed, and started crying.  I cried for the man pinned by the red Ford Focus, for the ambulance driver whose last view was the back of the dump truck, for Paul, oh God Paul, who was always so warm and friendly, now cold and dead beneath an SUV not 3 floors down.  All of this destruction, all of this unnecessary death, and all of it could have been avoided if…

YOUR FAULT.

No. That wasn’t right.  There’s no way it could have been my fault, could it? All I did was try to go to work. There’s nothing I could have done to cause that.  It was the ice…the traffic, the ambulance.  There was no way for me to stop it, I was just going to…

YOU SHOULD HAVE STAYED INSIDE.
‘
“Bullshit. That’s just superstitious bullshit.  Even if you stayed inside, all of those people would have died anyway.”

That may have been true, but…

“No buts! Do you hear yourself? You’re starting to sound just like your mother!”

My head was at war with itself once again, with the rational voice desperately vying for control. For the rest of the day, I did my best to actively avoid thinking, to varying degrees of success and failure.  Try as I might to keep it out of my mind, flashes of the accident would barrage my senses at regular intervals, bringing up a cavalcade of conflicting emotions.  Grief, anger, fear, and guilt.  The guilt was the worst of it, because I could explain it no more than I could accept it, yet it was there all the same.  It didn’t help that the scene was right outside my windows, and it especially didn’t help that I could hear the tow trucks and ambulances and fire engines.  By nine, I was exhausted in every sense of the word.  I don’t think I could have cried anymore if I tried; my eyes had become deeply sunk in two very red rings.  My neck was sore from the tiny bits of glass that I eventually found and removed with tweezers.  I checked the news before I went to bed, and the final number had been tabulated: 12 dead,15 injured, among which were several children.  My heart broke all over again as I turned off the TV and settled into blankets and pillows.

“Tomorrow will be better.  Tomorrow we can start to put this behind us.”

If only.

My alarm began blaring at 6:45 am on the dot, just as it always did, and when I slammed my hand on the snooze buttons, I immediately became aware of two things; the tense knot in the pit of my stomach, and a panicked whisper at the edge of my mind.

DOOM.  

That was how it all started.

1q0mm0m,https://i.redd.it/slkftio4nlag1.png,Glass center table.,"I was wanting to find a study wood table with a center of glass. I thought it would be nice to look under my bioactive enclosure and see all my hoggies ant hill tunnels and see her more often. I've seen her once since I put her in 3 weeks ago. We had a 2 minute staring contest and when I came back a few minutes later, she was gone. She's still only 1 year old and it's a 36x18x18 enclosure with 6 to ten inch gradate of substrate deep, so makes since she's got a lot of room to run around in.

Anyway. I was looking at something like this, where the weight would be on the wood part and not the glass. Does this seem sturdy enough? Has anyone had a stand or table that lets you see into bottom and could suggest something? Thank you!

P.s. 3 walls of the enclosure are covered so she has privacy, and didn't thank an exposed bottom would bother her since it'll mostly be dark underneath unless we want a look.",2,1767212854.0,hognosesnakes,1,1.0,False

* ***90 days gives you enough time to make real progress but creates actual urgency.*** *No “I have all year” excuses.* 
* ***More flexibility:*** *if your circumstances change, you adapt next quarter instead of abandoning everything.* 
* ***You get 4 fresh motivation bursts per year*** *instead of one hungover January promise.* 
* *And reflecting on* ***3 months is manageable*** *— you actually remember what happened, unlike trying to recall an entire year of blur.*

***What else I added to my method?***

* ***I use voice-to-text with AI for planning:*** *I can do this walking off a New Year’s hangover. But here’s the real benefit:* ***when you speak, you bypass your internal editor.*** *You say things more directly. AI catches patterns in your rambling that you’d filter out if you were carefully typing. Your contradictions become obvious. “Romance is my top priority but I spent zero hours on it” hits different when you hear yourself say it out loud.*
* *AI is IDEAL (and DESIGNED FOR) structuring unstructured thoughts. AI asks follow-up questions like a consultant running a QBR, summarises and shares back with you.* 
* ***The input metrics game-changer.*** *We obsess over outputs — getting married, getting promoted, losing 20kg. But* ***outputs = inputs × conversion rate*** *(which is function of difficulty, quality, and luck).* ***You can’t control outcomes. You can control inputs.*** 

***Want to try this technique?***

*Use the following prompt with Claude (or ChatGPT, though I prefer Claude). Set aside 45–60 minutes. Use voice input if possible. Be brutally honest — the AI won’t judge you, but it will call out your BS.*

1q0ml6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1q0ml6o/something_told_me_not_to_leave_my_apartment_i/,Something Told Me Not to Leave My Apartment. I Should Have Listened.,"I didn't go to work that day.  Not because I was sick, or for the simple act of playing hooky; no, it was something else.  Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.  My doom sense was tingling.  It might sound silly, but let me explain.  

Growing up, my mother would occasionally have days that she would refuse to leave the house.  If asked, she would tell you that something bad was going to happen if she got dressed and walked out the door, even if it was just to get the mail.  That was her doom sense, a deep seated feeling in the pit of her stomach that portended some unseen calamity just beyond the boundary of the walls.  As a kid, I would laugh at the ridiculousness of the idea; Mom's off her rocker today, she thinks she's going to die if she touches grass. It was easy to shrug it off because it was just one of many superstitions in a cup that was practically overflowing on the table, staining the carpet with a million little idioms and axioms.  Many of them, I'm sure you are familiar with; don't step on cracks, always toss a pinch of salt over your shoulder should a single renegade grain miss the plate and land on the counter, never pick up a penny that sits tails side up.  So many absurd rules, so many rituals to observe, it's a wonder she got anything done at all.  But above all else, one rule was to be followed no matter what; when your doom sense starts tingling, you must obey. Like a lot of lessons that can only be learned the hard way, it was funny until it wasn't; sometimes I think I'm lucky that I was ever able to laugh again. 

But, I don't like to dwell on that.  Life goes on, and it's easy to write off the things that happen to a child as exaggerated, or entirely mythologized.  When you're eleven, everything is big, and the world is always ending.  It's hard to distinguish random chance from preordained fate.  As an adult, I would tell myself that I didn't believe in such flights of fantasy.  The loudest voice in my head was always quick to rationalize; sometimes, bad things just happen, and there's nothing to blame but happenstance. I think I always knew that was bullshit.  I didn't go to work that day, or any day after, because I knew that something terrible was waiting for me.  Destiny, fate, fantasy, whatever name makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside, I know it for what it was; the truth.  

My alarm went off at 6:45 am just like it always did, and I got out of bed with the same sleep inertia that rested on my shoulders since the day I turned 30.  I didn't know it then, but to be fair, I barely knew my name before the first stream of hot water hit my back as I took my morning shower.  No, I got all the way through the grooming process, past a cup of Kroger coffee and a plate of scrambled eggs, all the way to the moment my hand touched the doorknob when it hit me.  Only hit isn't the right word.  Really, it is more akin to having your body filled with ice cold water.  A sharp chill runs down your spine, as your stomach clenches and drops, and your feet feel as though they weigh a thousand pounds each. Were there goosebumps?  Maybe, it was hard to tell for sure on top of everything else.  The world had stopped around me, as something in my mind let out a panicked hiss.

DON'T.  

I tried to shake the thought and turn the knob anyway

STOP.

My stomach dropped a second time and my hand froze in place.

WRONG. SOMETHING IS WRONG.

Before I knew what I was doing, I had backed down the hallway into my kitchen. The rational voice in my head was already making a fuss.

“What the fuck are you doing?  You're going to be late for work, and for what? A random bout of anxiety?”

Maybe it was right, maybe I was just having a moment, but it was one hell of a moment to be sure.  I buried that rational voice that screamed of write ups and lost wages and walked back to the coffee maker.  I told myself that another cup of coffee was exactly what I needed, and then I would hit the road.  As I pulled the pot from its cradle, I was alarmed to see my hands were shaking.  The great knot in my stomach had loosened a bit, but my nerves must have still been a little frayed.  I poured another cup, sprinkling the counter with little drops of java as the pot writhed in my hand.  I promised to clean those up when I got home, when I didn't have somewhere to be.  

Those drops are still there as I write this.  After slamming my second cup of coffee, the shakes simmered down into a dull tremble.  I looked at the clock on my stove, and saw that it read 8:30.  I couldn't remember if the clock was two minutes fast or two minutes slow, but it hardly mattered; with traffic, I was going to be late regardless. The rational voice piped back up just then, striking the tone of a disappointed mother, chastising me for my silliness.  

“What are you waiting for now?  Time to get going, idiot.”

It was right again.  I set the cup down and headed back to the door, determined to get to the office for my daily 200 bucks.  My hand touched the knob and that weight settled back into my body, but I was expecting it this time.  Before my body could shut down again, I forced my way through the door and into the hallway of the complex, feeling sweat prickle the back of my neck as the cold air of the AC wafted over me.  The heaviness was starting to return to my feet, but I was resolved to keep going.  

“Stop thinking about it, and go!”

I jogged down the hallway to the elevator, and jabbed a finger at the button.  The chime had been broken for months, but the down arrow flashed its usual faded yellow glow.  So far, so good.  A moment later, the doors parted in with a rusty groan and a dull thud, revealing the smudged stainless walls and outdated carpet of the elevator.  I put one foot over the threshold when another wave of anxiety washed over me.

TURN AROUND.  GO HOME NOW.

“Don't be stupid, get in the elevator!”

Conflicting voices now, fighting for dominance.  It felt like a war in my brain, but all I was trying to do was go to work! I wasn't disarming a bomb, or deciding if someone should be pulled off life support; this was stupid.  So, against the wishes of my body, I stepped into the elevator and rode it from the 4th floor down to the first, and I crossed the lobby with a brisk pace, ignoring the monsoon churning in my gut.  When I reached the double glass doors of the complex and peered out into the wider world outside, I saw… nothing, nothing at all.

The early morning traffic started and stopped in a steady rhythm, and passersby continued to pass on by.  Birds fluttered down the street, oblivious to the wide eyed man gawking at them through an inch thick pane of glass. Everything was completely and utterly normal.  I let out a nervous chuckle, and wiped my brow with the backside of my hand.  Man, I thought, I really worked myself up for nothing.

“Yeah, I've been saying that the whole time, asshole, now get moving.""

“Hey man, are you alright?” The voice came from behind me, at the front desk.  I turned my head a little too quickly to see the desk clerk, Paul, leaning forward with a look of concern set across his brow.  I must have walked right by him without noticing when I was forcing my way through the lobby.  “You've been standing at the door for like five minutes, and pardon my cliches, but you look like you've seen a ghost.” He wiggled his fingers as he said the word “ghost,” as if to reinforce the spookiness.

I shook my head and let out another chuckle.  I liked Paul.  For a glorified doorman, he was surprisingly warm and perceptive.  I shrugged and shoved my hands in my pocket.

“Shit, sorry. Just having a weird morning is all.” I paused for a second, and then added; “must have been that second cup of coffee giving me the jitters.”

Paul let out a hearty “ha” and leaned back in his chair.  “Well then, I need whatever you're drinking, because I'm on my third cup and it's not doing shit!” He produced a paper coffee cup from the desk and shook it lightly.  “Not much excitement here to keep me awake.  Heck, you're the most interesting thing I've seen all morning.”

We both laughed at that, and it felt good. It was good.  We shot the shit for a few more minutes, before I wished him a good shift and turned back to leave. I was feeling a little better after the exchange. The rational voice chided me for stalling, but I took it in stride. With rationality within my grasp once again, I took a shallow breath and pulled against the stainless steel handles of the doors, letting the cold early morning breeze cascade across my face and chill the standing sweat from my absurd little panic attack.  My hands were shaking again, and my insides were still at war with each other, but for a second, I felt good about my decision.  No flights of fantasy, no giving in to those unreasonable fears.  I was not my mother, and if I had a say in it, I never would be.  I threw Paul one last wave, and pushed through.



I stepped out onto the sidewalk, hearing the whoosh of air as the door closed behind me, set against a symphony of idling engines sitting impatiently at the red light. From somewhere in the distance, an ambulance siren was echoing off the buildings. I was outside, and now I just had to round the corner to the lot where my Corolla was parked, no doubt covered in a layer of snow.  I turned to walk, cursing myself for not remembering to put the wipers up before the snow came.  Ten steps down the sidewalk, the siren was much closer, and I could see the lights of the ambulance down the street. I had time to wonder how it was going to get past the gridlock on my street. I paused to watch it approach, the knot in my stomach twisted yet again, and the feeling of cold water spread through my limbs.

DOOM.

A loud screech cut through the air as the ambulance barreled down the south side of the street, heading straight for the standstill traffic. The driver was trying to slam on the brakes to no avail.  The salt trucks had not yet been to my neighborhood, and the road was thick with ice and slush. Even with his foot to the floor, the driver could do nothing to stop what was coming; the vehicle meant for saving lives was about to become an instrument for taking them. As I watched, the ambulance closed the distance at what I would guess was 50 miles per hour, gaining yards every time I blinked. I stood there and stared with a dawning horror of what was about to happen. My stomach dropped into my feet.

“What the fuck are you waiting for? RUN!”

The ambulance swung over the center line and plowed between two sedans at the back of the traffic jam with loud, mechanical crunch, sending both cars careening towards the sidewalk.  A red Ford Focus on the opposite side of the street hit the curb hard and flipped on its side, crushing a man against a wall before he even had time to scream. All at once, the weight in my feet let go, and I was sprinting towards the door of my building.  The ambulance hit the next set of cars; one of them was halfway into the next lane and the unstoppable force crushed the driver side and sent the car spinning into the next car in the line.  The screaming had started by then, a cacophony of fear and agony set against the sickening crack of metal on metal.  The carnage was quickly catching up to me, and I tried to tell myself that I couldn't hear the faint wet squelching under each impact.  I was lying.

I got to the doors and ripped them open, practically diving into the lobby as the ambulance reached the point I would have been standing. Paul was standing at the window, looking out in horror at the situation. He saw me run in and turned to yell something, but I just kept moving.

“What the fuck is going…” He never got a chance to finish that sentence. A man in an SUV was attempting to escape the chaos, and had backed halfway onto the sidewalk when the ambulance smashed through his fender, thrusting the SUV into the southern window of my building. The glass shattered instantly, spraying my back with little pieces of shrapnel. As I reached the elevator, the back half of the SUV was now resting where the sitting area normally was, and Paul was wedged somewhere underneath.  In a panic, I pushed the call button what must have been a hundred times, as I looked across the ruined lobby to the hell that was unfolding outside.  At the front of the intersection, a dump truck idled away in the left lane.  The ambulance, now looking more like a white and red hunk of scrap metal, found its final resting place in the back of that dump truck.  The impact boomed like a strike of lightning landed feet away.  The elevator doors opened behind me just as I watched the ambulance driver crashed through the windshield and break his neck on the steel wall of the truck in front of him. The force of the blow pushed the dump truck into the intersection, where more terrible crunches followed.

There is a weird zen that comes with being in shock. In the movies, when something bad happens and someone goes into shock, you don't really get a chance to know what that person is actually feeling.  As it turns out, it's almost sort of pleasant.  I was in shock when I stepped into the elevator, and the sounds of screaming and glass and metal faded away as the doors slid shut, replaced by the dulcet tones of elevator music.  To this day, I can’t tell you if the music was coming from the elevator or my own head.  I was faintly aware of a stinging sensation in the back of my neck, but beyond that, the lights were on and nobody was home.  The time between getting in the elevator and finding myself curled in a ball on my bed is mostly lost to me. I only came back to earth when my phone started buzzing in my pocket. I pulled it out and answered without looking, the motions just happening automatically.

“Hello?” The voice that came out of my mouth felt foreign to me; it was flat and hollow in the way a hypnotized child would speak.

“Jason, it’s Mark.  It’s going on 10 o’clock, and I don’t see you at your desk.  Your time card shows that you haven’t clocked in either.  Are you coming in today? Because if you’re not, you really needed to let me know beforehand.  Our attendance policy is very clear; minimum two hours notice for any call off, no exception.  I don’t want to write you up, but…” 

Of course it was Mark, Mr. By-The-Book, always crossing his T’s and dotting his I’s, quoting the employee handbook like scripture.  I never liked the guy, and I liked him even less at this moment. I sort of tuned out while he was talking, missing the last few things he said.  I could hear the sound of an approaching helicopter, when a thought occurred to me. 

“Did he say 10 o’clock? Has it really been that long?”

Even the rational voice was incredulous. Mark was still talking, something about points and discipline, when I found a point to interject.  

“There…there was a terrible accident.  Right outside my apartment…I…I almost…” I absentmindedly fumbled for the TV remote and turned the TV on my dresser to the Channel 2 News, and immediately saw an ariel view of my street, complete with all the carnage below. “Turn on the news Mark.  Channel 2.”

“Jason, I don’t see how this has…”

I hung up on him mid sentence and turned my attention to the TV screen, marvelling at the level of destruction that I was almost a part of.  The aerial view of the scene cut away to a news reporter on the street, who was doing her best to be professional despite the horrorshow before her, and mostly succeeding. I turned the volume all the way up, and walked over to the window that overlooked the street, pulling the curtains open as I listened for the grizzly details.  

“First responders are on the scene now, working to free those that are trapped in their cars.  Officers at the scene are unsure of the exact number of casualties, but the death toll is estimated to be at least 10, with at least a dozen others with serious injuries.

I tore myself away from the terrible scene below, and nearly screamed when I heard that. I desperately thumbed at the remote, trying to rewind to see if I heard what I thought I had just heard. I found the button and jumped back 30 seconds, feeling the remote grow sweaty in my hand.  

“...In total, 20 vehicles were involved in this terrible accident, and rescue operations could stretch well into the afternoon. For Channel 2, this is Paola Greyson.”

I didn’t realize I had been holding my breath,and I let it all out in a massive exhale. I felt stupid, believing the news had talked to me directly.  I must have been losing my mind, but who could blame me? I just witnessed the death of god knows how many people, and could have easily died myself if I hadn’t moved when I did. This fact, laid out so bare before me caused my knees to buckle.  In the time since, I hadn’t really processed what happened, and all at once, it crashed over me like a tidal wave.  I fell into my bed, and started crying.  I cried for the man pinned by the red Ford Focus, for the ambulance driver whose last view was the back of the dump truck, for Paul, oh God Paul, who was always so warm and friendly, now cold and dead beneath an SUV not 3 floors down.  All of this destruction, all of this unnecessary death, and all of it could have been avoided if…

YOUR FAULT.

No. That wasn’t right.  There’s no way it could have been my fault, could it? All I did was try to go to work. There’s nothing I could have done to cause that.  It was the ice…the traffic, the ambulance.  There was no way for me to stop it, I was just going to…
‘
YOU SHOULD HAVE STAYED INSIDE.
‘
“Bullshit. That’s just superstitious bullshit.  Even if you stayed inside, all of those people would have died anyway.”

That may have been true, but…

“No buts! Do you hear yourself? You’re starting to sound just like your mother!”

My head was at war with itself once again, with the rational voice desperately vying for control. For the rest of the day, I did my best to actively avoid thinking, to varying degrees of success and failure.  Try as I might to keep it out of my mind, flashes of the accident would barrage my senses at regular intervals, bringing up a cavalcade of conflicting emotions.  Grief, anger, fear, and guilt.  The guilt was the worst of it, because I could explain it no more than I could accept it, yet it was there all the same.  It didn’t help that the scene was right outside my windows, and it especially didn’t help that I could hear the tow trucks and ambulances and fire engines.  By nine, I was exhausted in every sense of the word.  I don’t think I could have cried anymore if I tried; my eyes had become deeply sunk in two very red rings.  My neck was sore from the tiny bits of glass that I eventually found and removed with tweezers.  I checked the news before I went to bed, and the final number had been tabulated: 12 dead,15 injured, among which were several children.  My heart broke all over again as I turned off the TV and settled into blankets and pillows.

“Tomorrow will be better.  Tomorrow we can start to put this behind us.”

If only.

My alarm began blaring at 6:45 am on the dot, just as it always did, and when I slammed my hand on the snooze buttons, I immediately became aware of two things; the tense knot in the pit of my stomach, and a panicked whisper at the edge of my mind.

DOOM.  

That was how it all started.

1q0mioc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1q0mioc/something_told_me_not_to_leave_my_apartment_i/,Something Told Me Not to Leave My Apartment. I Should Have Listened.,"I didn't go to work that day.  Not because I was sick, or for the simple act of playing hooky; no, it was something else.  Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.  My doom sense was tingling.  It might sound silly, but let me explain.  

Growing up, my mother would occasionally have days that she would refuse to leave the house.  If asked, she would tell you that something bad was going to happen if she got dressed and walked out the door, even if it was just to get the mail.  That was her doom sense, a deep seated feeling in the pit of her stomach that portended some unseen calamity just beyond the boundary of the walls.  As a kid, I would laugh at the ridiculousness of the idea; Mom's off her rocker today, she thinks she's going to die if she touches grass. It was easy to shrug it off because it was just one of many superstitions in a cup that was practically overflowing on the table, staining the carpet with a million little idioms and axioms.  Many of them, I'm sure you are familiar with; don't step on cracks, always toss a pinch of salt over your shoulder should a single renegade grain miss the plate and land on the counter, never pick up a penny that sits tails side up.  So many absurd rules, so many rituals to observe, it's a wonder she got anything done at all.  But above all else, one rule was to be followed no matter what; when your doom sense starts tingling, you must obey. Like a lot of lessons that can only be learned the hard way, it was funny until it wasn't; sometimes I think I'm lucky that I was ever able to laugh again. 

But, I don't like to dwell on that.  Life goes on, and it's easy to write off the things that happen to a child as exaggerated, or entirely mythologized.  When you're eleven, everything is big, and the world is always ending.  It's hard to distinguish random chance from preordained fate.  As an adult, I would tell myself that I didn't believe in such flights of fantasy.  The loudest voice in my head was always quick to rationalize; sometimes, bad things just happen, and there's nothing to blame but happenstance. I think I always knew that was bullshit.  I didn't go to work that day, or any day after, because I knew that something terrible was waiting for me.  Destiny, fate, fantasy, whatever name makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside, I know it for what it was; the truth.  

My alarm went off at 6:45 am just like it always did, and I got out of bed with the same sleep inertia that rested on my shoulders since the day I turned 30.  I didn't know it then, but to be fair, I barely knew my name before the first stream of hot water hit my back as I took my morning shower.  No, I got all the way through the grooming process, past a cup of Kroger coffee and a plate of scrambled eggs, all the way to the moment my hand touched the doorknob when it hit me.  Only hit isn't the right word.  Really, it is more akin to having your body filled with ice cold water.  A sharp chill runs down your spine, as your stomach clenches and drops, and your feet feel as though they weigh a thousand pounds each. Were there goosebumps?  Maybe, it was hard to tell for sure on top of everything else.  The world had stopped around me, as something in my mind let out a panicked hiss.

DON'T.  

I tried to shake the thought and turn the knob anyway

STOP.

My stomach dropped a second time and my hand froze in place.

WRONG. SOMETHING IS WRONG.

Before I knew what I was doing, I had backed down the hallway into my kitchen. The rational voice in my head was already making a fuss.

“What the fuck are you doing?  You're going to be late for work, and for what? A random bout of anxiety?”

Maybe it was right, maybe I was just having a moment, but it was one hell of a moment to be sure.  I buried that rational voice that screamed of write ups and lost wages and walked back to the coffee maker.  I told myself that another cup of coffee was exactly what I needed, and then I would hit the road.  As I pulled the pot from its cradle, I was alarmed to see my hands were shaking.  The great knot in my stomach had loosened a bit, but my nerves must have still been a little frayed.  I poured another cup, sprinkling the counter with little drops of java as the pot writhed in my hand.  I promised to clean those up when I got home, when I didn't have somewhere to be.  

Those drops are still there as I write this.  After slamming my second cup of coffee, the shakes simmered down into a dull tremble.  I looked at the clock on my stove, and saw that it read 8:30.  I couldn't remember if the clock was two minutes fast or two minutes slow, but it hardly mattered; with traffic, I was going to be late regardless. The rational voice piped back up just then, striking the tone of a disappointed mother, chastising me for my silliness.  

“What are you waiting for now?  Time to get going, idiot.”

It was right again.  I set the cup down and headed back to the door, determined to get to the office for my daily 200 bucks.  My hand touched the knob and that weight settled back into my body, but I was expecting it this time.  Before my body could shut down again, I forced my way through the door and into the hallway of the complex, feeling sweat prickle the back of my neck as the cold air of the AC wafted over me.  The heaviness was starting to return to my feet, but I was resolved to keep going.  

“Stop thinking about it, and go!”

I jogged down the hallway to the elevator, and jabbed a finger at the button.  The chime had been broken for months, but the down arrow flashed its usual faded yellow glow.  So far, so good.  A moment later, the doors parted in with a rusty groan and a dull thud, revealing the smudged stainless walls and outdated carpet of the elevator.  I put one foot over the threshold when another wave of anxiety washed over me.

TURN AROUND.  GO HOME NOW.

“Don't be stupid, get in the elevator!”

Conflicting voices now, fighting for dominance.  It felt like a war in my brain, but all I was trying to do was go to work! I wasn't disarming a bomb, or deciding if someone should be pulled off life support; this was stupid.  So, against the wishes of my body, I stepped into the elevator and rode it from the 4th floor down to the first, and I crossed the lobby with a brisk pace, ignoring the monsoon churning in my gut.  When I reached the double glass doors of the complex and peered out into the wider world outside, I saw… nothing, nothing at all.

The early morning traffic started and stopped in a steady rhythm, and passersby continued to pass on by.  Birds fluttered down the street, oblivious to the wide eyed man gawking at them through an inch thick pane of glass. Everything was completely and utterly normal.  I let out a nervous chuckle, and wiped my brow with the backside of my hand.  Man, I thought, I really worked myself up for nothing.

“Yeah, I've been saying that the whole time, asshole, now get moving.""

“Hey man, are you alright?” The voice came from behind me, at the front desk.  I turned my head a little too quickly to see the desk clerk, Paul, leaning forward with a look of concern set across his brow.  I must have walked right by him without noticing when I was forcing my way through the lobby.  “You've been standing at the door for like five minutes, and pardon my cliches, but you look like you've seen a ghost.” He wiggled his fingers as he said the word “ghost,” as if to reinforce the spookiness.

I shook my head and let out another chuckle.  I liked Paul.  For a glorified doorman, he was surprisingly warm and perceptive.  I shrugged and shoved my hands in my pocket.

“Shit, sorry. Just having a weird morning is all.” I paused for a second, and then added; “must have been that second cup of coffee giving me the jitters.”

Paul let out a hearty “ha” and leaned back in his chair.  “Well then, I need whatever you're drinking, because I'm on my third cup and it's not doing shit!” He produced a paper coffee cup from the desk and shook it lightly.  “Not much excitement here to keep me awake.  Heck, you're the most interesting thing I've seen all morning.”

We both laughed at that, and it felt good. It was good.  We shot the shit for a few more minutes, before I wished him a good shift and turned back to leave. I was feeling a little better after the exchange. The rational voice chided me for stalling, but I took it in stride. With rationality within my grasp once again, I took a shallow breath and pulled against the stainless steel handles of the doors, letting the cold early morning breeze cascade across my face and chill the standing sweat from my absurd little panic attack.  My hands were shaking again, and my insides were still at war with each other, but for a second, I felt good about my decision.  No flights of fantasy, no giving in to those unreasonable fears.  I was not my mother, and if I had a say in it, I never would be.  I threw Paul one last wave, and pushed through.



I stepped out onto the sidewalk, hearing the whoosh of air as the door closed behind me, set against a symphony of idling engines sitting impatiently at the red light. From somewhere in the distance, an ambulance siren was echoing off the buildings. I was outside, and now I just had to round the corner to the lot where my Corolla was parked, no doubt covered in a layer of snow.  I turned to walk, cursing myself for not remembering to put the wipers up before the snow came.  Ten steps down the sidewalk, the siren was much closer, and I could see the lights of the ambulance down the street. I had time to wonder how it was going to get past the gridlock on my street. I paused to watch it approach, the knot in my stomach twisted yet again, and the feeling of cold water spread through my limbs.

DOOM.

A loud screech cut through the air as the ambulance barreled down the south side of the street, heading straight for the standstill traffic. The driver was trying to slam on the brakes to no avail.  The salt trucks had not yet been to my neighborhood, and the road was thick with ice and slush. Even with his foot to the floor, the driver could do nothing to stop what was coming; the vehicle meant for saving lives was about to become an instrument for taking them. As I watched, the ambulance closed the distance at what I would guess was 50 miles per hour, gaining yards every time I blinked. I stood there and stared with a dawning horror of what was about to happen. My stomach dropped into my feet.

“What the fuck are you waiting for? RUN!”

The ambulance swung over the center line and plowed between two sedans at the back of the traffic jam with loud, mechanical crunch, sending both cars careening towards the sidewalk.  A red Ford Focus on the opposite side of the street hit the curb hard and flipped on its side, crushing a man against a wall before he even had time to scream. All at once, the weight in my feet let go, and I was sprinting towards the door of my building.  The ambulance hit the next set of cars; one of them was halfway into the next lane and the unstoppable force crushed the driver side and sent the car spinning into the next car in the line.  The screaming had started by then, a cacophony of fear and agony set against the sickening crack of metal on metal.  The carnage was quickly catching up to me, and I tried to tell myself that I couldn't hear the faint wet squelching under each impact.  I was lying.

I got to the doors and ripped them open, practically diving into the lobby as the ambulance reached the point I would have been standing. Paul was standing at the window, looking out in horror at the situation. He saw me run in and turned to yell something, but I just kept moving.

“What the fuck is going…” He never got a chance to finish that sentence. A man in an SUV was attempting to escape the chaos, and had backed halfway onto the sidewalk when the ambulance smashed through his fender, thrusting the SUV into the southern window of my building. The glass shattered instantly, spraying my back with little pieces of shrapnel. As I reached the elevator, the back half of the SUV was now resting where the sitting area normally was, and Paul was wedged somewhere underneath.  In a panic, I pushed the call button what must have been a hundred times, as I looked across the ruined lobby to the hell that was unfolding outside.  At the front of the intersection, a dump truck idled away in the left lane.  The ambulance, now looking more like a white and red hunk of scrap metal, found its final resting place in the back of that dump truck.  The impact boomed like a strike of lightning landed feet away.  The elevator doors opened behind me just as I watched the ambulance driver crashed through the windshield and break his neck on the steel wall of the truck in front of him. The force of the blow pushed the dump truck into the intersection, where more terrible crunches followed.

There is a weird zen that comes with being in shock. In the movies, when something bad happens and someone goes into shock, you don't really get a chance to know what that person is actually feeling.  As it turns out, it's almost sort of pleasant.  I was in shock when I stepped into the elevator, and the sounds of screaming and glass and metal faded away as the doors slid shut, replaced by the dulcet tones of elevator music.  To this day, I can’t tell you if the music was coming from the elevator or my own head.  I was faintly aware of a stinging sensation in the back of my neck, but beyond that, the lights were on and nobody was home.  The time between getting in the elevator and finding myself curled in a ball on my bed is mostly lost to me. I only came back to earth when my phone started buzzing in my pocket. I pulled it out and answered without looking, the motions just happening automatically.

“Hello?” The voice that came out of my mouth felt foreign to me; it was flat and hollow in the way a hypnotized child would speak.

“Jason, it’s Mark.  It’s going on 10 o’clock, and I don’t see you at your desk.  Your time card shows that you haven’t clocked in either.  Are you coming in today? Because if you’re not, you really needed to let me know beforehand.  Our attendance policy is very clear; minimum two hours notice for any call off, no exception.  I don’t want to write you up, but…” 

Of course it was Mark, Mr. By-The-Book, always crossing his T’s and dotting his I’s, quoting the employee handbook like scripture.  I never liked the guy, and I liked him even less at this moment. I sort of tuned out while he was talking, missing the last few things he said.  I could hear the sound of an approaching helicopter, when a thought occurred to me. 

“Did he say 10 o’clock? Has it really been that long?”

Even the rational voice was incredulous. Mark was still talking, something about points and discipline, when I found a point to interject.  

“There…there was a terrible accident.  Right outside my apartment…I…I almost…” I absentmindedly fumbled for the TV remote and turned the TV on my dresser to the Channel 2 News, and immediately saw an ariel view of my street, complete with all the carnage below. “Turn on the news Mark.  Channel 2.”

“Jason, I don’t see how this has…”

I hung up on him mid sentence and turned my attention to the TV screen, marvelling at the level of destruction that I was almost a part of.  The aerial view of the scene cut away to a news reporter on the street, who was doing her best to be professional despite the horrorshow before her, and mostly succeeding. I turned the volume all the way up, and walked over to the window that overlooked the street, pulling the curtains open as I listened for the grizzly details.  

“First responders are on the scene now, working to free those that are trapped in their cars.  Officers at the scene are unsure of the exact number of casualties, but the death toll is estimated to be at least 10, with at least a dozen others with serious injuries. In total, 20 vehicles were involved in this terrible accident, and rescue operations could stretch well into the afternoon. For Channel 2, this is your fault, Jason.”

I tore myself away from the terrible scene below, and nearly screamed when I heard that. I desperately thumbed at the remote, trying to rewind to see if I heard what I thought I had just heard. I found the button and jumped back 30 seconds, feeling the remote grow sweaty in my hand.  

“...In total, 20 vehicles were involved in this terrible accident, and rescue operations could stretch well into the afternoon. For Channel 2, this is Paola Greyson.”

I didn’t realize I had been holding my breath,and I let it all out in a massive exhale. I felt stupid, believing the news had talked to me directly.

We're *days* away from launching this huge new feature I've been pouring my soul into for months. My coffee is still hot, my inbox is (miraculously) manageable, and I'm mentally high-fiving myself for being so on top of things. Yeah, that lasted about as long as a free trial.

Then, the Slack message hits. Not just any Slack message, but the red-alert-emoji-laden kind from QA: ""CRITICAL BUG FOUND - BLOCKS LAUNCH."" My stomach immediately did that lurching roller-coaster thing, and my perfectly hot coffee suddenly tasted like regret. I swear I could hear my internal monologue screaming, 'Noooooooooo!' louder than Darth Vader.

Next thing I know, my calm morning schedule is obliterated. I'm juggling calls with engineering, trying to calm down a slightly frantic sales team, and explaining to leadership (again!) why this *absolutely-can't-wait* bug means we might need to push. The whiteboard in our war room quickly became an indecipherable mess of arrows, timelines, and expletive-laden scribbles (mostly mine, in my head).

Hours bled into each other. The faint aroma of burnt popcorn from someone's lunch wafted through the office, a cruel reminder that I hadn't eaten. My brain felt like a tab-overloaded browser, each open tab representing a different stakeholder demanding answers I didn't yet have. The pressure was a palpable weight on my shoulders, making even the simple act of typing feel like a monumental effort. But slowly, painstakingly, the team started chipping away at it. Engineers were coding like their lives depended on it, and QA was testing with eagle eyes.

By 7 PM, the bug was squashed. SQUASHED! The relief that washed over me was so intense I nearly cried into my now-cold, forgotten coffee. We're still on track for launch, albeit by the skin of our teeth and with a few more grey hairs on my part.

This subreddit is a community space for fans of Netflix’s Stranger Things -- specifically **Joyce Byers and Jim Hopper**: the pairing, the characters, and all the things the show very intentionally leaves up to our imaginations.

This is a place for:

* Fanfiction
* Fan art, videos, and other creative projects
* Discussion and meta about canon, themes, characterization, and the show in general
* AO3 guides and filters to help you find Jopper fic by trope, rating, length, completion status, and more
* Find-a-fic threads for when that one story is on the tip of your tongue - or when you’ve got a prompt you’d love to see someone run with

Whether you’re here for quiet domestic fic, slow burns that hurt, post-Russia feelings, or just to talk about how magnets work, your love of Italian food, and the timeless appeal of friends → enemies → lovers, you’re in the right place.

He like a  tea alot

But changed to coffee because she liked it a lot.

He had no color he called his own, 

But now he loves blue since she had shown.

He never cared for flowers before, 

But tulips caught his heart for sure.

Not for the petals, soft and bright, 

But because she smiled when they came in sight.

He changed himself from who he was, 

Not for fame or friends-just because.

He tried to be the man she'd need, 

Hiding his pain and letting her lead.

Love made him grow, made him strong,

But sometimes even strength feels wrong.

The same love broke him deep inside, 

Now he's just a boy who tries to hide.

He tried to forget, to let her go, 

But memories stick and feelings show.

Still, he prays she finds her way, 

Even if he's not part of her day.

\*She came so soft, like evening air, 

And left like fast storms , unfair.

She stayed for months, maybe a year,

\-But he held on, through every tear.

She moved on-she had to, maybe, 

But he stayed stuck in ""what if"" and

""maybe.""

And though his world kept spinning around,

Her name still echoes without a sound.

She was a chapter, short and sweet, 

But her memory never faced defeat.

And though it hurts, he still holds tight

1q0mdxu,https://v.redd.it/tg68jli8llag1,Espresso machine started leaking after holidays,"After a week of holidays (and not using the machine) I noticed that the machine started leaking. I cleaned it with the proper solvent twice and I removed a cover to see that there is a part that clearly leaks water. I suspect that this is a failsafe in case the exhaust gets blocked but I am not sure. The machine still produces coffee though.

It’s a Koenig finessa and the part is listed here (number 7) https://tavora.sparepartscatalog.com/d2p/d2p?ALIAS=25213&TIM=854&BRAND=Koenig&MACHINE=1433&NAVGROUP=Kaffee_Koenig&PNO=B03900.1

Any advice if this can be fixed without replacing the whole part and what the role of this part is? Why is there a hole at the top that seems to be clearly designed to leak?",1,1767212218.0,ifixit,0,1.0,False
1q0mdi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/rivals/comments/1q0mdi3/qp_survival_guide_for_toxic_people/,QP Survival Guide (for Toxic People),"* Don't worry about the team composition. Just pick the player you wanna play. The correlation between team comp and win rates in QP is completely disconnected. I know we've all seen it: blowout 0 kill losses as 222 comp. On the other hand, i've won games with 6dps, 6 heals, etc goofy ass compositions. Just play the game with the hero you want. Doesn't get any deeper than that.
* If you leave games, you'll get hit with those 5 or 10 minute suspensions. Instead, just do what i do: place a heavy ish object on your keyboard to press down the W key. I use a letterman multitool which is PERFECT for this. Get your character out of spawn and just walk him into a wall in the back corner. You won't get kicked for AFK. Use this as a break, grab a smoke, make a coffee, etc. Fuck everyone else. You don't owe em anything.
* Don't worry or stress about reports/reporting. First of all, reporting literally does nothing. Some of you might point to those nice little feel-good messages netease sends you: ""person XYZ you reported has been banned from competitive matchmaking bla bla bla"" 100% placebos. 100% lies. If you don't believe me, if/when you receive those messages, just check their stats again. You will see that they are still playing, no bans, no nothing.
* On the same note, netease simply DOES NOT punish for anything except actual in-game detected cheating. You can smurf, you can say racial/ethnic slurs, you can badmouth CCP, you can throw, you can be toxic, you can literally make rpae jokes and nothing will happen to you. Ask me how I know. Act accordingly; if this bothers you, mute chat and voice.
* Depending on your (hidden) QP MMR, most of us still get bot matches in QP. team comps are always 222 (your 2 bots will try to best ""fill""). You can usually tell your bot team mates, because when you swap they also instantly swap to ""fill"" the needed roles. Enemy teams (6 bots) will always be 222. They will swap a lot. Flyers with go in a perfect triangle pattern. Jeff ults will be useless. In any case, dont get upset: just go afk (see above) OR use this as an opportunity to finish you achievements and get some extra blue coins.

A lot of what I'm saying will upset people, and those people are in the right.

This entirely rests on netease. This is the game that netease designed and developed. This is the community that netease wants to cater to and sell skins to. Toxic people, like myself, are literally what netease considers the core paying customer base that they live and die by, so they will never do anything to these people.",0,1767212184.0,rivals,2,0.29,False
