1itx72b,https://www.reddit.com/r/lamictal/comments/1itx72b/lamictal_heart_rate_insomnia_brainstorming/,"Lamictal heart rate, insomnia (brainstorming)","Hi, to begin with: yes I am in close contact with my psych, cooperating. Also using AI as an assistant, just need to weed out the AI hallucinations. I'm a 30s man.

**Hopefully for anyone this sounds familiar and can help or we can brainstorm more together. I tried the search but results were quite subjective.**

I have available my 23andme V3 genetic data (300k SNPs raw data I think), which has helped immensely when conversing with AI. I use perplexity, chatgpt, grok, to see different answers.

Trying to be a bit scientific here. Have high resting HR with lamictal. Baseline is 65-70, with **lamictal at 150mg**, it is now around 85-90 (I use a whoop to track, bought it just for this ""journey"").

25,50,75,100,125mg all same issue, high resting HR started the moment i started with 25 (i have everything in my diary so no placebo).

Jealous of people who report sleepyness :D , I have had insomnia for 8 weeks now (only gabapentin helps for that). Have tried taking in the evening, and mornings. Whoop reports mostly of light sleep, barely SWS and REM (so poorly restorative). Total sleep is only 5-6h, with 2-3h restorative. With gabapentin total duration is same but SWS is improved. Doctor gave me propranolol, 10mg helps drop the heart rate but I hate it since i love running and gymming. Been testing morning, evening dosing, to no effect. Sleep is probably worse when taken before bed. Can't use melatonin SR or XR, horrible nightmares everytime with many doses. Only thing what helps is gabapentin.

Genetics-wise: I have high prefrontal cortex dopamine (COMT gene, worrier, not warrior), most likely low mesolimbic dopamine (lifetime anhedonia, only love to read, but dont get a kick of ""normal people fun stuff""), diagnosed cyclothymia, low serotonin clearance (so like built-in SSRI, SSRI make me megazombie and give akathisia). So pretty much makes me a nerdy achiever with superfocus, love to read for hours but otherwise missing any type of enjoyable traits, making me a miserable asshole as well. This is a lifelong thing, I've been like this since opening xmas gifts at 4 years old, my mom reports. Anyways, let's discuss only lamictal, however I think there is a certain genotype which is particularly sensitive.

Hypomania triggers are: coffee, nicotine, poor sleep, work stress, traveling stress



**Anyways: to my theory.**

NE: norepinephrine , DA: dopamine, 5HT: serotonin, HR: Heart Rate (resting)

Is it possible lamictal raises NE -> high HR? And for sensitive people this is the reason for high HR, and insomnia?

1. Gabapentin 600mg drops NE strongly -> reason for way better sleep

2. I have tested with multiple herbs all kinds of effects and tracked things. Interesting was using Mucuna Pruriens. Taking 100mg l-dopa equivalent (raises DA) in the morning to an empty stomach, HR dropped to normal 65-75 despite taking lamictal at the same time. Effect ended after a few hours and redosing later in the day didn't repeat the effect. To my knowledge, DA and NE are on a seesaw, so raising the other, might lower the other and vice versa.

3. Propranolol helps to drop HR (via NE reduction)

Anyone else done some research on this? Could it just be increased NE? Been total on lamictal for 56 days, so kinda slow taper, 150mg 8 days. Was on 125mg for 11 days but didnt suppress depressive period after hypomania so raised dose. HR still an issue with 125.

Whether you’re looking to revamp your living space or planning to [buy furniture online](https://nakodahomes.com/), staying ahead of the latest trends can help you make stylish and informed choices. From sustainable materials to multifunctional pieces, [furniture stores](https://nakodahomes.com/) are witnessing a shift in demand. This year, the focus is on functionality, comfort, and timeless aesthetics. Let's explore what’s trending in 2025 and what styles are becoming outdated.



What’s In?

1. Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Furniture

Sustainability is no longer just a buzzword; it’s a priority in modern furniture design. Consumers are increasingly opting for eco-friendly options, including reclaimed wood, bamboo, and recycled materials. Online furniture stores are responding by offering stylish yet sustainable collections. The demand for furniture that aligns with environmental consciousness is rising, making it easier than ever to furnish your home without compromising on style. Expect to see an increase in FSC-certified wood, non-toxic finishes, and upcycled materials in furniture stores near you.

2. Multifunctional and Space-Saving Designs

With urban living spaces becoming smaller, multifunctional furniture is gaining popularity. Think sofa sets that convert into beds, dining room tables with built-in storage, and coffee tables that double as workstations. These versatile pieces are ideal for maximizing space in compact apartments. If you’re searching for practical yet stylish furniture, consider browsing an online furniture store that specializes in smart solutions.

3. Bold and Expressive Colors

Neutrals have dominated the furniture scene for years, but 2025 is all about bold colors and vibrant hues. Shades like deep blue, emerald green, and burnt orange are making waves in living rooms, replacing the safe beige and grey palettes. Whether it's a statement sofa set or colorful bedroom furniture, homeowners are embracing rich tones that add personality and warmth to their spaces.

4. Curved and Organic Shapes

Furniture designs in 2025 are moving away from sharp edges and geometric forms. Instead, rounded shapes and organic silhouettes are trending. Sofas, coffee tables, and even bedroom furniture are featuring soft, fluid lines that create a cozy and inviting atmosphere. This trend is inspired by nature and focuses on comfort, making it a perfect choice for modern homes. If you’re planning to buy online furniture, look for pieces with smooth contours and sculptural forms.

5. Mixed Materials and Textures

Combining different materials is a key trend this year. Wood paired with metal, glass with marble, and fabric with leather create a sophisticated and dynamic look. Whether it’s a dining room table with a stone top or a sofa set with metal accents, this fusion of textures adds depth and interest to interiors. Many furniture stores are curating collections that feature diverse materials, giving homeowners plenty of stylish options.

6. Maximalist Decor

Minimalism is taking a backseat as maximalism gains momentum. Bold patterns, layered textures, and statement furniture pieces are defining modern interiors. Think plush velvet sofas, intricate carvings, and eye-catching wallpaper. If you’re browsing a furniture shop near me for the latest trends, expect to find vibrant upholstery, oversized artwork, and elaborate design elements. Maximalism allows for a more personalized and artistic approach to home decor, making it a hit in 2025.

7. Tech-Integrated Furniture

Smart furniture is revolutionizing home living. From coffee tables with built-in wireless charging to bedroom furniture featuring LED lighting and voice control, technology is seamlessly blending into furniture design. Online furniture stores are offering more tech-friendly options, catering to the growing demand for convenience and innovation in home decor. If you love futuristic interiors, investing in smart furniture is a great choice.

8. Vintage and Retro-Inspired Pieces

Vintage aesthetics are making a strong comeback, with furniture stores embracing mid-century modern designs and retro influences. Curved wooden furniture, rattan chairs, and tufted sofa sets are trending, adding a nostalgic charm to contemporary homes. This mix of old and new creates a timeless appeal, perfect for those who appreciate classic craftsmanship. Whether you visit a furniture shop near me or browse online, you’ll notice a revival of vintage-style furniture with a modern twist.

What’s Out?

1. All-White Interiors

For years, all-white interiors have been a go-to choice, but in 2025, they are being replaced by warmer, more inviting hues. Overly sterile and monochrome spaces are giving way to earthy tones, rich colors, and layered textures. Instead of an all-white bedroom furniture set, opt for warm neutrals or deep, rich shades to create a more welcoming ambiance.

2. Fast Furniture

Disposable, low-quality furniture is on its way out as consumers prioritize durability and sustainability. Investing in well-crafted, long-lasting furniture is now a preferred choice over trendy, mass-produced items. If you’re looking to buy furniture online, choose pieces made from solid wood and premium materials that stand the test of time.

3. Overly Matching Furniture Sets

Gone are the days of buying entire furniture sets that look identical. Modern interior design favors a mix-and-match approach, blending different styles, colors, and materials for a curated, eclectic feel. Instead of purchasing a perfectly matching dining room table and chairs, consider mixing different designs to add character to your space. Many furniture stores near me are offering custom pieces that allow for personalization, making homes feel unique and stylish.

4. Open Shelving in Kitchens

While open shelving was once a trendy choice for kitchens, it’s becoming less popular due to its high maintenance. Cluttered shelves and constant dusting have made homeowners rethink this trend. Instead, closed cabinets and hidden storage solutions are making a comeback, keeping kitchens looking neat and organized.

5. Industrial Aesthetic

The raw, exposed brick and metal-heavy industrial style is gradually fading out. Homeowners are leaning towards softer, more comfortable designs that feel cozy rather than cold. If you’re looking for a furniture shop near me that stocks on-trend pieces, go for warm wood tones, soft upholstery, and organic shapes instead of the harsh, industrial look.

6. Excessive Minimalism

While clean lines and clutter-free spaces are still appreciated, ultra-minimalist interiors are losing their appeal. The “less is more” approach is being replaced by layered textures, cozy decor, and furniture with personality. Homeowners are seeking a balance between simplicity and comfort, moving away from overly sparse designs.

Final Thoughts

As we move into 2025, furniture trends are embracing sustainability, bold colors, and multifunctional designs. Whether you’re planning to buy furniture online or visit furniture stores near me, these trends will help you make the best choices for your home decor. From eco-friendly materials to tech-integrated designs, the focus is on comfort, style, and longevity. Stay ahead of the curve by choosing timeless yet trendy furniture pieces that reflect your personality and lifestyle. If you’re looking for the latest sofa set, dining room table, bedroom furniture, or coffee table, be sure to explore a trusted [online furniture store](https://nakodahomes.com/) or a reputable furniture shop near me to find the perfect addition to your home.

1itx2q6,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/1itx2q6/i_met_my_younger_self_for_coffee/,I met my younger self for coffee,"We hugged. 

She clutched me a bit too tight. So uncertain. Desperately seeking reassurance that all will be well. 

“All will be well,” I tell her. 

“Really?” she asks, slightly pleading, a touch of panic in her voice. 

I can tell her anxiety is through the roof. If I held her hand now, it would be dripping with sweat. And then she’d be mortified. So I hug her again, giving a reassuring squeeze, look into her eyes & say, “Yes, really.”

“But what will happen with…?” 

I just shake my head, smile, & hold up my hand to stop her. 

She doesn’t need all the answers now. She needs to find them out for herself. In her own time, in her own way. To know all the answers now will defeat the purpose of the lesson.

One of the biggest on-going lessons of her life will be to develop a sense of internal safety. To trust that everything will unfold exactly as it should. And to know, in the very depths of her soul, whatever happens, whoever comes, goes, stays or disappoints, whoever breaks her heart, or is there to mend it - she has her own back. So she needs to have these experiences. They’re hard. And they’ll break her. But they’ll break her open. 

I’m so fucking proud of this girl. She keeps giving & getting back up, even when she just wants to curl up into a ball & hide. I want to cry for her, because her heart is as big as the ocean, yet she still struggles to love herself. 

She doesn’t know it yet, but she’s the answer to every prayer she ever asked. 

“I love you so much” I say, holding her face in my hands & kissing her forehead. 

“We’ve got this.”

She nods, wiping away a tear. A tiny part of her believes she’ll be ok. Her faith is small, but it’s there.

We are childfree, have 2 small dogs that we like to take on walks and used to living in quiet friendly suburbs with most shopping (Target, Aldi, Kroger, Home Goods) and a comprehensive medical clinic (walk in clinic, specialists, imaging) about 15 minutes away, and would love to have that convenience here.

1itwz0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1itwz0j/the_bagel/,The Bagel,"

There’s something about bagels—soft, chewy, crispy, warm—that has always comforted me. But I never knew that comfort could transform into something dark, sinister, and horrifying. My tale begins on an ordinary Tuesday, or so I thought. Now, when I think back to that fateful morning, it’s hard to discern where the ordinary ends and the extraordinary, and ultimately terrifying, begins.

I had just moved into a new apartment in the city. It wasn’t much—just a small one-bedroom above a coffee shop—but it was mine. The excitement of independence and the fresh start was invigorating, though I did feel the weight of loneliness creeping in every now and then. I tried to distract myself with routine: work, meals, Netflix, a bit of exercise. Nothing that would raise alarm. I hadn’t made many friends yet in the area, but I didn’t mind. I had my mornings to myself.

One morning, the smell of freshly baked bread wafted up from the coffee shop below. I had been trying to make a more consistent breakfast for myself, so I decided to head down and grab a bagel. I wasn’t normally a bagel person—croissants and muffins were more my speed—but the warm, savory aroma was irresistible. I pulled on a jacket, slipped into my shoes, and headed downstairs.

The shop was small and cozy, the kind of place where you expect to see people working on their laptops while sipping lattes. The walls were lined with shelves of books and mismatched chairs, giving it a homey vibe. The barista behind the counter gave me a friendly smile as I approached.

“Good morning! What can I get you today?” she asked.

“Hi. I’ll have a bagel. Do you have any with cream cheese?” I asked, scanning the menu.

“We’ve got plain, sesame, poppy, and everything,” she replied.

“Everything sounds good.”

She nodded and began preparing my bagel, pulling it from a tray fresh out of the oven. The smell was intoxicating. A warm, doughy scent mixed with just a hint of salt, butter, and something else. Something that made my stomach growl louder than it already was.

“Here you go,” she said, handing me a paper bag with my bagel inside.

I paid and gave her a smile before returning to my apartment. As I walked up the stairs, the bagel’s warmth seeped through the paper bag, comforting me. I couldn’t wait to eat it. I had been up for hours, staring at the same computer screen, trying to make sense of work that just wouldn’t come together. The promise of something simple and delicious was just what I needed to get my mind off everything else.

Once inside, I set the bagel down on the counter, grabbed a knife, and sliced it open. The inside was soft, the perfect balance of chewy and airy. I spread a generous amount of cream cheese on both halves, taking a moment to appreciate the beauty of such a simple, humble breakfast. The first bite was glorious—smooth cream cheese, warm bagel, just a little bit of salt to tie everything together.

But as I chewed, something felt… off. It wasn’t the taste. No, the bagel was delicious. It was the way it felt. Something about the texture of the dough felt different. It wasn’t quite right. I paused mid-bite, confused. My mind tried to rationalize it. Maybe I had just eaten too quickly. But there was something unsettling about the texture, something strange.

I set the bagel down, chewing slowly, trying to figure out what was wrong. As I studied the bagel, I noticed that it wasn’t quite as perfectly round as I had thought. The edges were uneven, slightly misshapen. And the color—it wasn’t the golden-brown I expected. It was… darker. Almost burnt.

Then, I saw it.

At the center of the bagel, where the hole was supposed to be, there was something inside. Something… moving.

I leaned in closer, my heart racing. The hole wasn’t just a hole. It was alive. The edges of it seemed to pulsate, like it was breathing, expanding and contracting with a strange rhythm. I froze, unable to look away, my stomach turning as dread settled in. I felt my hands tremble, but I couldn’t stop staring at it.

The bagel shifted, as though it were somehow alive—like it had a mind of its own. The texture, the dough, seemed to stretch and bend in unnatural ways, as though it were made of something other than flour and water. The more I stared, the more I could see that it wasn’t a bagel at all. It was something else. Something that had taken on the form of a bagel.

A soft, almost imperceptible sound rose from within the dough—a whisper. Low. Breathy. It sounded like words, but I couldn’t quite make them out. I leaned in, trying to hear more, but the whisper faded just as quickly as it had started. My skin crawled.

Suddenly, the bagel lurched. The hole in the center expanded rapidly, stretching wide like a gaping mouth, and from it came a deep, hollow voice.

“Eat me.”

I recoiled, stumbling back from the counter, my heart pounding in my chest. The bagel shuddered and contracted, the hole shrinking back into place. The voice—it had been real. I had heard it.

I wasn’t sure how long I stood there, staring at the bagel in terror, but eventually, my mind started to piece together what had just happened. The bagel wasn’t just a bagel. It wasn’t a simple, everyday food item anymore. It was something else. Something evil.

I backed away, too scared to do anything but breathe and watch it, like a predator silently observing its prey. My mind raced. Could I eat it? What if it was cursed? What if it was dangerous? It felt wrong, so wrong, in ways I couldn’t explain.

But I knew that the bagel wasn’t done with me.

A few seconds later, the voice came again, but this time it was more insistent, more forceful.

“Eat me, now.”

I felt a chill creep up my spine as the command reverberated in my bones. My hand, against my will, slowly reached for the bagel. It was as though I had lost control of my own body. The bagel was calling to me, drawing me in like a magnet.

The moment my fingers touched the surface of the bagel, the room around me seemed to darken. The air grew thick, suffocating. The walls, once painted in cheerful yellows and blues, seemed to warp and twist. The shadows grew long and distorted, as though the very fabric of reality itself was bending. The bagel—no, it—had power. Terrible, dark power.

In that moment, I had no choice. My mouth opened, my hand forced the bagel to my lips, and I took a bite.

The taste was… indescribable. It wasn’t like anything I had ever eaten before. It wasn’t just bread and cream cheese. It was something far worse. Something foul and wrong. The dough tasted like decay, the cream cheese like sour, rancid milk. And yet, I couldn’t stop. I chewed, my mind screaming at me to spit it out, but I couldn’t.

The whispers grew louder now, all around me, scratching at my mind. The bagel had consumed me. I felt its power pulse through my body, taking root in my veins. Something inside me began to change. I was becoming part of it, and it part of me.

I tried to scream, but my voice was gone. The bagel was everything now.

And the whispers? They didn’t stop. They just kept saying one thing, over and over.

“Eat more. Become one with me.”

But I was already gone.

The last thing I remember before I lost myself completely was that strange, hollow voice, whispering one final command:

“Never leave.”

I guess he's around 50 years of age and is rather quirky. After class he started inviting some of us out to the pub. After the second time we had all been to the pub together I got an email from him following up on our earlier conversation (he shared a few links to things we had spoken about earlier on). I replied to say thanks but it carried on from there with him continuing to email me & it turned into a back and forth conversation.  We spoke a lot and it resulted in him becoming quite attached to me (sending me paragraph after paragraph every night about his life). I think I felt sorry him because he lived at home with his parents, was single, didn't seem to have a great social life outside of work and was generally a little bit odd so I continued chatting to him on email or the uni chat and he would sometimes invite me out for coffee. I felt awkward saying no so I met up with him a few times thinking we would be disgussing my work but he spend the whole time speaking to me socially. If I didn't reply to him within a day or declined a coffee (usually because I was busy studying or going out with flatmates) he would behave standoffish with me in seminars so I would feel super guilty and would email him apologising for not replying quickly enough. Or sometimes he'd send 100 plus messages in a row at strange times of the night. He told me he had saved every email and chat exchange we had and remembered details down to the date he first taught me, college results and he had looked up my address on the computer system. I backed off because I was finding it intense. He sent a super long email to my personal email address about how much he missed our friendship and that he was sad I didn't want to spend time with him anymore. I ignored it, blocked him and reported him to my personal tutor but I don't think anything has been done. Luckily I completed the module so I'm not taught by him anymore and he has left me alone. However I've met two other students on my course (both female) who have been taught by him and have experienced THE EXACT same stuff with him sending them messages outside of Uni and trying to be befriend them but I don't think they have reported him. I realised that he was only ever interested in the pub trips when it was just the girls. He was always busy if the boys were coming along too. I don't know what I can do because he hasn't actually DONE anything and he could just be lonely but he does only seem to be interested in meeting up with his female students who are less than half his age???

We spend so much time together that we might as well be dating. She asks me to coffee, invites me out, and even messages me just to walk two minutes to the shop with her.

I’ve never been in a relationship before and, until now, never truly cared about having one. But with her, it’s different. I really like her. It’s caught me completely by surprise.

The problem? I can’t seem to tell her how I feel. I’ve had plenty of chances, moments that felt right, but every time, I keep my mouth shut. I know what I want to say, but when the time comes, I freeze. I feel like I’m stuck in this cycle where I chase something, but the second I catch it, I back off. It’s frustrating—both for me and probably for her too.

I’m starting to worry I’m taking too long, but I don’t know how to break this pattern. How do I get past this hesitation and just say what’s on my mind?

1itwszr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SMCIDiscussion/comments/1itwszr/hold_or_sell_before_10k/,Hold or Sell before 10K ???,"Hi SMCIers, 

I am an SMCIer as well. I want to write a little bit about this stock and I hope it helps you to make a smart decision on your own. 

Story 1: Last 3 months, I bought SMCI stock at a price around $18. I heard it could be delisted from Nasdaq because of financial perspective. Then I was scared and thought a lot about this stock even I was taking a shower. Then, after 3 hours of buying the dip point, I sold it. The story starts from here. After selling it, I don't know why I have a feeling of quiet regret. I am starting to deep dive more into the company, the product they are making and also into the CEO's profile. Then, I was surprised ELON MUSK is using SMCI products for his data center - it is the biggest data center in the meantime. 

Story 2: I am a big fan of coffee. I also want to invest in a coffee company. You know what, there is a company name ""Luckin Coffee (LKNCY)"". It was an IPO around 2019 with a price of 19-20$, then the stock price went up to 30-40$. After several months of the peak, the company was caught because of cheating on the revenue report (fake transactions on that report getting revenue higher than the actual). After a while, this stock **was delisted** from Nasdaq. Then the price immediately drops to around $1. Then, the company fired the CFO along with some leadership. After that, it hired a new management team. They decided to focus on core value: coffee, innovation of the ordering process, etc... After 5 years, the stock price is now around $30 even though it is traded on the OTC market. I guess it will be higher because of potential international growth.   

Based on those 2 stories above, yes they're my personal experience. I would give you some insights. 

* If you already have a diamond in your hand, please keep it and look for the long-term vision.
* Disregard the bad news about the 10k, DON'T FOMO. 
* Please buy and sell with your decision from your brand, not from your heart. 
* In the worst case, this company will be delisted from Nasdaq, then let's buy more and more if you believe about the products, the demand for AI, data centers,... - I would do this even if I must eat bread every day in the next few years. Patients in this case will get a payoff. Don't panic!!!

If you're daily trading, I think this post is not for you.

The kick-me dog bounced around the backyard like a floppy old mop looking for a place to shit. Alan smoked by the back gate and watched the chocolate seal rag-doll cat sit on a bare patch of the overgrown walk next to him. It observed the freedom of the world beyond as something both curious and detestable.

“You got it good here, old boy.”

The feline ignored him with an apathy only possible for its species.

The air harbored a humid nip that numbed his chin and ears. Katelyn had taken everyone’s photograph for new IDs. She cut his hair in front of her kitchen sink, and he shaved for the first time in a decade, revealing the inevitable double chin of middle age and a crease around his mouth he didn’t remember.

His adventures in not smoking resulted in failure. _Here I am, at it again_. He took a deep drag that burned his lungs, let it out slowly, and imagined he was blowing fire into the frozen air.

Bridger and Nash, who were not targets of a nationwide manhunt, had gone out to look for posters. Their plan was to check the places White Owl might advertise: pizza parlors, shopping malls, arcades, and skate parks.

Gwen, Alan, the Greta, and the boys were confined to the house and yard. The Greta, taciturn as the kitchen table where she sat, watched Francis vegetate in front of the television with Ty. Her head would track his small trips to the kitchen for a drink or a snack, now and then lifting her hand a centimeter off the tabletop as if she desired to touch him. Francis would notice her uncomfortably with a timid wave or nod of his head. Ty was less gracious. “Why don’t y’all talk?” he’d said directly to her. When she ignored him, he said, “How about I pull off your mask?”

The boys had grown quickly and fiercely close, like identical twins, each delineating a different side of the coin. Francis possessed a serene stillness that affected Ty, who could be a firecracker. Ty spoke for the both of them. When he was hungry, Francis was hungry. When he was bored, Francis was bored. If he went to the kitchen, he would pull Francis along. If it was Francis who went to the kitchen, Ty would watch him to make sure everything was smooth sailing. Sometimes, he’d even go as far as the entrance to the living room and wait for his return, which was celebrated with a bouncy enthusiasm. Both boys were deeply engaged in the latest season of the teenage fantasy series, _Eternal Love._

Alan detested the franchise, though it would be social death in their cloistered company to admit it.

The story, about as deep as a mudpuddle, told of a boy who falls in love with a girl during the pyramid times in ancient Egypt. Stealing a riff from Shakespeare, the star-crossed lovers were from warring families, forcing them to carry on their affair in secret while their kinfolk died around them. At one point, the boy is at a party in a tomb of an ancient and forgotten sorcerer when he becomes separated from his friends and stumbles into the wrong chamber, disturbing the wizard’s rest and fulfilling a prophecy due to his virtue and his love.

The powerful mage awakens, and after a long battle of wits, the boy is victorious. Enraged, the wizard uses a loophole and curses his rival.

_Lo! The sun will rise and the sun will set,_

_And you’ll outlive the withered stars above._

_Your eyes will see thy friends fade into death,_

_Held in your prison of eternal love._

He stays young while his girlfriend grows up, marries his best buddy, has a child, and in the first season’s finale is gruesomely murdered by an emissary of the wizard.

The boy, crushed by grief, cannot find death in his immortal bondage. He knows he cannot continue in his line—they’re already questioning his youthful looks—so he fakes his death and banishes himself from his homeland. Only to return in disguise when the daughter (played by the same actress) is of the age when he first loved her mother. And so begins _Eternal Love,_ the first drama franchise to surpass a trillion dollars.

Now, it’s season four. A sensational and controversial cast change has almost eclipsed the presidential election. In the story, four thousand years have passed since that fateful night in the wizard’s tomb. She—the direct lineage of his first and true love and (queer plot twist from Season 3) carrier of the “Soul Spark”—is now the daughter of a wealthy and buffoonish merchant. Her mother died during childbirth, and her father has married a sadistic woman with a son who lusts after the beautiful girl.

The Hero, Jonathan Winters, played by climate refugee and international heartthrob Go Min Sung (also the co-lead singer—next to superstar idol Woo Chang Wook, of the same talent agency, and the first actor to play Jonathan Winters—of the boyband series namesake, _E.L._), is an apprentice blacksmith working in her father’s stables where he—having perfected his craft for nearly four millennia—creates for her the most exquisite jewelry. This, he keeps a pining secret until one day, after fighting off a groping stepbrother, she stumbles, ravished and sobbing, into his workshop cubby behind the stables.

How many times has he lost her and found her again? It’s been a millennium since the tragedy of season three (AKA: the gay season), and finally, the Soul Spark has guided him here. When he sees her, it’s like falling in love for the first time. Though on the outside he’s a tender youth, on the inside he’s as ancient as the sibyl, and he has made an oath that he will never interfere, never again be seduced by that infernal curse. But God, she is beautiful…

It was a hack job of clichés, overwrought tropes, impossible plot twists, and bad lines, but the kids loved it, and they would pay anything to get more of it.

Four years in, the show had become a worldwide phenomenon. The teen idols were rolling in hundreds of millions of dollars, full of their own real-life drama and scandal. Merchandising and affiliations were everywhere: a clothing line, backpacks and lunch boxes, fast food endorsements, toys, an admittedly bad VR game, and a music group sensation that monopolized the charts. It was fucking pandemonium.

Alan had never watched an entire season, but it was so pervasive in the daily zeitgeist that the storylines and hackneyed reveals sunk in through osmosis.

Francis and Ty were hooked; it was like cocaine candy to their adolescent minds.

Gwen emerged from the basement, ceremoniously carrying a book from which she read like a schoolgirl.

The cat padded away upon her approach.

“Bum a smoke?” she asked.

He gave her one and lit it for her. They smoked in silence.

“So, you’re a psychiatrist?” she said at the halfway point of the cigarette.

“Psychologist.”

“Right, what’s the difference?”

“Drugs.”

“Do you have depression or something?” she said.

“Do you think I have depression?” he said.

“I do,” she said.

He shrugged and took a drag. His mental health had been evident to himself for a long time. For fourteen years. Since one discrete moment.

“Becky Madison… when she came into the station…” she didn’t finish.

The urge to put his fist through the small window in the garage was overwhelming. “And?” he said.

“If you want to talk, I’m here. No judgment.”

“Thank you.” What could he say that he’d not analyzed in his own head a million times?

“Do you mind if I talk?” she said.

“You can talk. It’s fine.”

“Francis needs you. And if you’re going to be fading in and out, and not clear…”

They passed a silence with a cigarette in which he loathed himself. The cat returned, as if on patrol, and sat in the spot at their feet where the snow had been trodden down. It glared out at the despicable freedom of the back alley.

“I’m sucking, aren’t I?”

She nodded. “There’s some shit going on, in case you haven’t noticed.”

“I’ll get it together,” he said.

“Thank you. So, do you want to hear my plans?”

“Yes, I do, Deputy Wolf.”

“I think we should stay in this house and hunker down, just like we’ve been doing. We help Francis with his concert. In and out like a bank heist. We wait for things to cool off.”

“We need to get out of the country,” he said.

“That’s our best bet,” she agreed. “If we can get to Texas, we can get to Mexico. From there, we have options.”

“What about the Free City? There’re a hundred million people, most of them refugees. We could get lost in there forever.”

The screen door to the upstairs of the house opened, and Katelyn called to her little dog. The mop flopped around, barked at Alan and Gwen, then trotted to the house. The woman scooped up the little pooch, then shut and locked the door behind her.

“She invited me up for coffee this morning,” Gwen said.

“Oh yeah? And you lived to tell about it?”

“She’s scared. She’s a woman set in her ways, and our visit has severely disrupted her life. But she’s determined to help us. She knows about the hunters. The way she said it made it sound like a cult. They believe that if the Maji do their enchantments, it will destroy the Veil and usher in something called the Chaos.”

“Typical apocalyptic eschatology. Kind of like Pastor Tony and his followers.”

“Except for the shapeshifting and murderous tendencies,” said Gwen.

“I’m not convinced Pastor Tony doesn’t have murderous tendencies.”

Over another cigarette, Gwen summarized what Katelyn had told her.

“And that’s why they’re after Francis and Ty. Not just them, everyone who went to that concert.”

“It’s a holy war,” said Alan.

“More like a holy extermination,” Gwen said.

“So it’s genetic, being Maji?”

“Apparently, yes. They’ve always been around, living in secret. But there’s another way; if you had a parent that used a certain strain of the Escape drug.”

“Ty’s mom,” said Alan.

Gwen nodded, adding, “Katelyn said it was Lethe Vonnix who discovered the link between the Maji and Escape.”

“I should know that name?”

“Elvira. Remember on the dock at the Halloween gala?”

The inebriated night came back. At the time, he’d thought she was one of Becky’s spies. Had he not been so self-centered, he may have been able to avoid… “Fuck. I missed it. She was trying to warn us.”

“Her approach wasn’t exactly subtle,” said Gwen. “There’s another way. You go to a Francis Builds A Fire concert. That also gets you a Maji card.”

“We’re all Maji,” he said, remembering Francis’s words.

“Congrats, how do you feel?” she asked.

“I’m waiting for my magic powers to kick in. Hoping for invisibility,” he deadpanned.

Gwen did not smiled. “I think about that night all the time. I don’t know what I experienced, but I’m glad I did.”

He felt the urge to kiss her. Instead, he took a drag and, ignoring Katelyn’s rule, flicked his cigarette butt over the fence to vanish in the snow.

“I’m done drinking.”

It was Gwen who kissed him, quickly, blowing smoke between their faces. Despite the cold, her lips were warm. Her tongue played against his. She pulled back, and he touched her lips with the tips of his fingers.

_It’s been fourteen years since…_

“You kissed me,” he said.

“I have problems,” she said. “You should know that.”

This time, he kissed her, holding the small softness of her face in his palms, feeling her fiery hair through his fingers.

They lingered outside in the broad vastness of a gray daylight. He felt the world was entering an enduring winter; more snow and cold were coming. He didn’t risk thinking Gwen might choose to stay by him through it. It was too much to ask of her… of him… of fate.

But all the same, everyone is single. Because I don't think it is something available anymore. I look outside and see that even most handsome guys or attractive girls are alone. Not even talking about my friends and other people I know. It is not about looks or social stuff. People I know who attend the most social activities where you can meet different type of people also fail . 

Maybe dating is outdated and it is given us as a huge topic only to consume our time? Maybe women just don't like guys that much to date them? The concept is funny as well.

## Why Choose a Cat Body Carrier?

Before we dive into specific product reviews, let's understand the appeal of a cat body carrier. These carriers offer numerous benefits compared to traditional hard-sided or even soft sided cat carrier options.

*   **Hands-Free Convenience:** This is arguably the biggest advantage.A hands free cat carrier allows you to navigate busy streets, manage other tasks, or even simply enjoy a walk without the burden of a bulky carrier pressing against your side. Ideal for urban dwellers and those with active lifestyles, the cat chest carrier and cat backpack carrier give you greater freedom of movement.

*   **Enhanced Bonding:** keeping your cat close to your body provides a sense of security and comfort for them, especially for anxious felines. The physical closeness can reduce stress during travel and foster a stronger bond between you and your cat. Many owners even use a cat pouch carrier around the house for added comfort & closeness.

*   **Increased Safety & Security:** Many cats dislike traditional carriers, leading to stress and potential escape attempts. A well-designed, escape proof cat carrier worn close to your body adds an extra layer of security, preventing your cat from bolting in unfamiliar environments. The adjustable cat carrier feature will also help.*   **Travel-Friendly Solutions:** Whether you're hopping on a plane, taking a train, or simply driving to the vet, a travel cat carrier designed for body-wearing can simplify the process. Certain models are even designed to meet airline approved cat carrier standards, making air travel easier.

## Who are Cat Body Carriers For?

Cat body carriers aren't suitable for all cats or all owners. They are especially well-suited for:

*   **Owners of Small to Medium-Sized Cats:** Most body carriers have weight limits, typically accommodating cats up to 15-20 pounds. If you have a larger breed cat, be sure to check the weight capacity of the chosen carrier carefully.

*   **Urban Dwellers & Apartment Living:** Navigating crowded city streets and using public transportation becomes much easier with a hands-free carrier option.

*   **Owners Who Prioritize Bonding:** If you want to keep your cat close and provide reassurance during travel, a body carrier is an excellent choice.

*   **Active Individuals:** Do you enjoy hiking, walking, or exploring the outdoors? A cat hiking carrier lets you bring your feline companion along for the adventure (provided they are pleasant with it!).

*   **Owners Whose Cats Dislike Traditional Carriers:** Some cats simply refuse to enter traditional carriers. A body carrier can provide a less stressful option.

I’ve been reading about non-stimulants but the reviews are so mixed. Has anyone had similar experiences with stimulants, switched to non-stimulants and found it’s still helped them with focus/motivation?

My lowest adult weight was 197 but I will never get back there. My ultimate goal is to lose 80 lbs. However I understand that it's the small goals that make you successful and sometimes you get off track by focusing on the end goal. 

Anyway, I swim probably 2-3 times a week normally doing anywhere from 12-16 laps... I'm going to up this to 20 laps per swim soon. I don't do any other cardio anymore. I used to walk a lot but I find it to painful now. A combination of the weight I've gained in the last few years plus my supination of both feet causes extreme low back pain after more than 10-20 minutes of walking. I have tried custom insoles, orthopedic shoes and such. It helps but the pain lately is to great. 

So my question is how many calories should I take in per day if my only exercise is 30 minutes in the pool & 15 minutes of sauna time? Should I add weight training as well? I drink about 3L of water daily and typically have a coffee. I recently gave up on artificial sweetner in my coffee, and I am avoiding alcohol & soda as much as I can. My biggest downfall.. over eating and take out foods.

My overweight and SALT intake was mainly due to excess charcuterie type foods or large portions (I rarely fast food, maybe 3 times a year. We never eat because we have young kids. I make our own sauces, broths (not beef though, can't find marrow bones yet), and my own pasta. But i LOVE cheese). 

With the weight loss, and the recovery from the spine injury allowing me to be more active again - the doctor had me ween off the BP meds. That was Aug 2024. 

Between moving (we moved) and holidays, I wasn't eating as clean (added back in some alcohol and charcuterie) and with the weather, I wasn't biking as a mood of transit and my activity level wasn't as high, but still aerobically working out 3 times a week minimum (it was part of my on-going spine recovery). My weight loss stalled. 

I went for a run the other day - and began salivating badly and had to keep spitting. The saliva tasted metallic, or like the iron from your blood, but no blood. So I stopped running, and leisurely walked home. When I stopped walking at home, I began frequently coughing hard until I'd start gagging. This lasted about an hour or so. I made dinner (roast turkey breast with potatoes and beets, and didn't season with any salt). Had dinner, relaxed after dinner with family. But I still super off, like I did when I first went through all this hypertensive stuff; foggy, just off and not well. So at like 7:30pm (my run was around 3pm, dinner at 5:30), I take my blood pressure, 150/106 (doctor compared my machine to their calibrated one, and my home one is fairly accurate, within 2). With the off feeling, and spine issues that give me chest pains occassionally, I took some of my prescription. I was scared!

I went to the doctor the next day. Couldn't get an appointment, but technician took BP, 141/90, which matched my home one. 

They said prefer is to not take the medicine until my doctor appointment in a week, but that i can. But I'm scared. The high BP, mixed with my mild chest pains, and off feeling.... I've been taking 4 days now, and finally just starting to not feel off, and my BP has been 130-140/74-86 in these last days (not trending downward, just all over in that range). 

1. Please just tell me I'm a stupid idiot and over reacting. And nothing is wrong. 
2. Isn't BP going high bad? Like life threatening (risk for stroke, heart attack). How do you not over analyze every speck of salt you eat? Or feel worried if you can't aerobically work out for the day? Does it get normal, and you become comfortable without worry again? (Like someday, I dream of an all-inclusive and guzzling some tropical alcoholic drinks while at a pool side bar. Will I be able to guilt-free do this?)

(Note: Last year, I did a full heart work-up thing: CT, EKG, stress test, etc... doctor said my heart is good. Doctor also said my chest pains are consistent with heart problems - but my heart tests say, good heart. So the cardiologist said, don't know what causes your chest pain, maybe pinched nerve since I have the other spine issues.)",1,1740050101.0,hypertension,1,1.0,False

* A. ''I'm going to limit my meals to 2-3 per day to reduce acid secretion.''
* B. ''I'm going to make sure to remain upright after meals and elevate my head when I sleep.''
* C. ''I won't be drinking tea or coffee or eating chocolate anymore.''
* D. ''I'm going to start trying to lose some weight.''

**Correct answer:** A

**Rationale:** The correct answer is ''I'm going to limit my meals to 2-3 per day to reduce acid secretion.'' This statement indicates a need for more teaching because large meals increase the volume and pressure in the stomach, delaying gastric emptying, and worsening symptoms of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). The recommended approach is to eat smaller, more frequent meals (4-6 small meals a day) to reduce acid reflux. Choices B, C, and D demonstrate good understanding of GERD management by highlighting the importance of staying upright after meals, avoiding trigger foods like tea, coffee, and chocolate, and addressing weight management, which are all appropriate strategies to manage GERD symptoms.",1,1740050029.0,PassNCLEXexams,0,1.0,False

Anyways, I appealed & they said “fine we’ll drop it to £20 but if you appeal again and lose then you have to pay £170” anyway I appealed again thinking “if you’re willing to go from £170 to £20 then why not just let it go??” 

The independent group sided with them BUT they sided with them stating £20 is a fair fine, so I went back to them and said okay, fine, I’ll pay £20. They then continued to argue with me and say no it’s £170, so I said that isn’t what the agents agreed to and I’ll pay the £20. Suddenly total silence for.. 6-7 months?

After about 4-6 months on the stimulants I had a “stimulant induced manic episode and psychosis”
or that’s what my psychiatrist called that two week period.

I had been taking prozac (half a tablet)  for PMDD intermittently for 2 weeks on and off at a time in sync with my luteal phase. I didn’t experience any mania or hypo mania when I started using SSRI’s , but my psychiatrists conclusion is that the SSRI’s and Vyvanse and stress induced a manic episode that may not have been as likely if I wasn’t using psychiatric medication. 

I remember asking him “okay, so do I have bipolar?” and he went “wellll, we actually call this bipolar 3, a medically induced manic episode” 

Ever since then I’ve been on the bipolar medication, Lamotrigine. I’ve taken lamictal for almost 2 years now and stopped stimulants entirely, no coffee, nothing. It’s just that I am curious and worried that Lamictal is affecting my memory and cognitive ability. I need to memorise things quickly for my job as an actor, lines, hitting marks, continuity…ect. And I just wonder if maybe I’m taking lamictal unnecessarily at this point? Would I be likely to have another manic episode if I went off it and didn’t take stimulants? I just want my sharp brain back. so bad. might be brain damage from that manic episode 2 years ago though. Who knows? I have a strong feeling I do not have bipolar, but finding out for sure runs the risk of having an episode independent of stimulants and SSRI’s

TLDR: don’t actually know if I have bipolar. I’ve had 1 psychotic manic episode followed by a downnnn swing that went over the course of 3 months. however this was due to Vyvanse (also was on SSRI’s but this didn’t trigger the episode). I want to get off lamictal due to work because I don’t think I need it.

1itw3se,https://www.reddit.com/r/idleslayer/comments/1itw3se/chest_hunt_simulation/,Chest Hunt Simulation,"I've been playing the game for a while, and I've never cared whether the chest hunts were really random or not.

Recently, I started reading this reddit in an effort to find better grind strategies, and one reccurent topic is chest hunt randomness. 

Since nobody has access to the game code, it's not possible to answer with certainty, but it is possible to simulate a sufficient number of games with *""""""""“(true)”""""""""* randomness >!yes timothy I know true randomness doesn't exist!<to compare what we're supposed to have and what the game gives us.

With a little python, here's the strategy I've implemented:

\- I open a first chest  
\- If it's not a mimic, I lose both crystals, open the shield and continue playing.  
\- If the first chest is a mimic, then the first crystal is used and I open a second one.  
\- If the second is also a mimic, then I use the second crystal, then open the shield in third.  
\- Otherwise, I open the shield second.   
\- Then I open the chests randomly until there are only mimics left or I come across a mimic.

*(I haven't implemented the x2 in the strategy yet, I'll come back when I've got the time to write a script that works with it)*

I then simulated a player who had done 1000 chest hunts, and I ran this 1 million times, so 1 billion chest hunts, that should be enough to reduce biases.

Here is the code:  
[https://gitlab.com/mondertime1/chest-hunt-simulation/-/blob/main/main.py](https://gitlab.com/mondertime1/chest-hunt-simulation/-/blob/main/main.py)

Here are the results:  
\----------------------------------------------------------------  
Total simulations: 1,000,000,000

Total perfect games: 4,745,207

Weighted average perfect game ratio: 0.0047 (0.47%)

Average perfect games per group: 4.75

Median perfect games per group: 5.0

Minimum perfect games in a group: 0

Maximum perfect games in a group: 19

Standard deviation: 2.17  
\----------------------------------------------------------------

This suggests that a player with 1000 chest hunts *should* have between 2,58 and 6,92, let's say 2 and 7 perfect hunts.  However, this estimate doesn’t account for the x2 strategy, which most players with 1000 hunts likely use, so it’s more of a baseline.   
  
As I haven't done many chest hunts because I usually skip them, I can't interpret the results objectively. Can anyone more serious than me about the game say whether the results show a rigged system?

If you have ideas for improving the code, or if you find errors>!*(I wouldn't be surprised if there were, I wrote this thing during a coffee break between two smokes)*!<, pull requests are open.

I am due for a bonus this month and would like to buy two things. First a decent automatic espresso grinder and second an espresso machine with frother to make cappuccino. My current equipment is an aeropress and agaro manual grinder but would want to upgrade now to a full fledged cappuccino station. 

I am ok on budget as long as its not something extraorbinant. I am not looking for cheap 10k machines but also not a 1 lack machine. As long as the product justifies the cost for occasional home use and performs good and has customer support in India I am good to buy it. ",2,1740048753.0,IndiaCoffee,4,0.75,False

1itvtm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayrelationships/s/5i9ieU9xqU,Update: A second chance…,"UPDATE: After posting our past here and collecting some great advice, i met him…and wanted to share an update after our coffee date. A lot happened during this meeting that gave me a clearer perspective on our past dynamic and where we stand now.

When we first met, the atmosphere was friendly but a bit awkward. We started with the usual catch-up topics—how our summer went and what had been going on in our lives since we last saw each other. It felt oddly casual, almost like catching up with an old acquaintance rather than someone I once had deep feelings for.

Eventually, the conversation shifted toward dating. He openly talked about his recent experiences with other people—how he’d gone on dates, hooked up, and even cooked for others. This hit me harder than I expected, especially because, during our time together, he had never cooked for me or invited me over for deeper, intimate conversations. It made me question whether he had really cared about me in the same way.

The turning point came when I asked him why he hadn’t reached out to me after our fight. He told me that he often felt I had belittled him during our time together and that, even though he didn’t call me out at the time, it stayed with him. He said he had been hurt on multiple occasions but chose to let it go for the sake of peace. However, the night of our fight, when he pushed back at me for the first time, my reaction was so strong that he thought I was being unreasonable—“a complete asshole,” in his words. That’s why he never reached out again.

At that point, I reminded him of the moment when he had said something that hurt me deeply and explained how much it had affected me. I told him that I expected him to check in on me after the fight, knowing how upset I was. He admitted that he had wanted to reach out but decided against it because he felt like things had “evened out” between us, as if neither of us owed the other an apology.

Then came the topic of his cold and emotionless text to me recently. He explained that he had seen our last conversation before he blocked me, which I hadn’t mentioned in my first post. After our fight, he had reached out to me on Grindr with an unrelated, almost ridiculous message. I had responded with what I now call a “closure message,” trying to end things on my terms. Shortly after that, I sent him another message out of sheer horniness, suggesting that we meet up purely for sex, without any emotional involvement. He had seen that message, and it stayed with him. So, when he sent his recent text to me—the one that felt detached and almost transactional—it was his way of mirroring what I had done. It wasn’t that he didn’t care or didn’t want to check in on me; he just thought, “If you could send a message like that, then so can I.”

I had to admit that his explanation made sense, and I understood where he was coming from, even if it didn’t make me feel much better.

Before the date, he had been unusually engaged in our text conversations, making an effort to keep the dialogue alive and trying to maintain a connection. He was more attentive, sending messages that showed genuine interest in what I was up to. It was a stark contrast to how things had been before and even during the date itself.

As the date continued, he asked me multiple times whether I wanted to meet again. I avoided giving a straight answer, saying things like “Who knows?” or “Let’s see where things go.” He pressed me for clarity, saying he needed to know where I stood because he had made it clear that he wanted to see me again. Finally, he said, “I’ve asked you multiple times if you want to meet again. I won’t ask again. If you decide you want to see me, you’ll have to be the one to reach out.”

We parted ways after that, heading in different directions.

Reflecting on the date, I realized the romantic spark between us is gone. There was no excitement, no butterflies like there had been in the past. I even found myself questioning my past attraction to him. On the other hand, I was reminded of the intellectual connection we share—something I haven’t found with anyone else. I missed that deeply, and it was refreshing to engage with him on that level again.

Since the date, we’ve continued messaging. He’s been much more attentive and engaged, checking in regularly and trying to keep the conversation alive. It feels like he’s making an effort to stay connected. We might meet again soon, maybe for dinner or a movie, but I’m still uncertain about what I really want from this. I’m not ready to trust him completely, and I’m not sure I want to rekindle anything romantic. At the same time, I don’t feel ready to cut him off entirely. Maybe we’ll end up as friends, or maybe there’s still something worth exploring—only time will tell.

In the meantime, I’ll continue dating. Until we have a clear conversation about what we want or where we stand, I’m not stepping away from the dating scene like I did before.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on all of this!",1,1740048720.0,gayrelationships,0,1.0,False

Seeing someone say theyre 30 and reached their first 1M is insane to me. I come from a low income family and spent my 20s working to pay for rent. I regret my 20s, but I couldn’t have imagined myself do anything differently. My friends are artists and musicians and dont dream of having that amount saved.

I work hard, and im slowly noticing my body get deteriorated, I don’t have brain power to learn how to invest and what to invest in, and because this money didnt come easy, I keep procrastinating.

I have a partner who is still trying to fogure it out financially, he is in between jobs and we share the rent so that gave me the opportunity to save as much as I did. I saved this much in the last year and a half. 

I dream of starting my own business, of yhe freedom it would bring me and of yhe frustration that would feel worth it. I feel like it would be worth being frustrated unlike this job which never feels worth it in all honesty. I work remotely and this had been a dream for me, to work remotely, but i feel stagnant yet ready to hopefully kickstart that business.. maybe.. one day

I feel small, I am a designer, Ive almost always been an executive.. I have no idea how to start and where.

I want to start my own fragrance sprcificallly oud business, I want to turn what I do into a service mostly do marketing for others and hire people, I want to have a small coffee shop, a laundromat, a carwash.. I want to sublease apartments, maybe multiple. But I have no idea how to start, with what, whats the least risk? I want to have an asmr channel on youtube, I want to move.. feel fruitful.. break the generational curse. I am a stateless 3rd gen refugee, I was born and raised in the gulf and dealt with an uncertain existence my whole life, I want to break this, I want it to end and I don’t want to live somewhere and pay taxes just to become citizen. I want to buy my passport because I can afford it. I want to be safe, do it got my grandparents, for my poor parents, for love.. for me.

She felt him before she saw him, the warmth of his body as he settled beside her. A strong arm wrapped around her shoulders, pulling her against him. She sighed, melting into his embrace, the heat of his skin seeping through the fabric of her sweater.

“Still cold?” he murmured, his lips brushing the top of her head.

“A little.” She smiled against his chest, tilting her face up to look at him.

His fingers traced slow, absentminded patterns along her arm, a touch so light it sent a pleasant shiver through her. His gaze softened as he leaned in, pressing a kiss to her temple, then her cheek, then lower, his lips lingering just below her jaw.

She closed her eyes, letting herself sink into the warmth of him, into the quiet comfort of the moment. There was no rush, no urgency—just the steady, unspoken rhythm between them.

“You always do that,” she whispered, a lazy smile tugging at her lips.

“Hm?”

“Make everything feel softer. Safer.”

He pulled back just enough to meet her gaze, his fingers brushing a stray strand of hair from her face. “That’s because you are my favorite place to be.”

Her heart swelled, warmth blooming in her chest. She set her mug down, turning to fully face him. He didn’t hesitate, cupping her face in his hands, drawing her in for a kiss—slow and deep, full of quiet devotion.

I'm an almost 50yo tomboy, exposed to Agent Orange (dioxin) from pregnancy. I was born with a rare congenital birth defect and trashed hormones but way back when no one understood stuff, so I've developed a constellation of odd diseases requiring specialized treatments. Of course many of those treatments have begun to hurt my liver.

My neurologist sent me to a liver specialist who did a fibro scan and a biopsy within three weeks of seeing him.

He diagnosed me as MAFLD 5/8
Macrovesicular score 2
Centralized balloon hepatocytes score 2
Lymphocytic lobular inflammation score 3
Bridging fibrosis stage 3

I also tested positive >1:640, anti-centromere pattern) with negative ASMA, AMA and elevated serum IgG (2626 mg/dL)

His current thoughts are to allow me to wean off the immunotherapy if possible and try to lose as much weight as I can before any more invasive liver treatment.

This was 4 months ago.

My last LFTS 5 days ago were normal 🥰

How I did it
flax and chia for probiotics
Greek Yogurt, cream cheese, skyr, A2 milk for probiotics
Peanut butter
Oatmeal
Frozen or fresh berries in protein smoothies
Multi-vitamin for women 50+ from Thorne
Thorne SAT for liver repair
2 liters of water on top of the milk or tea or coffee

35 grams of fiber per day
1 gram of protein per pound of weight

I've lost 8% towards my weight loss goal and have added back in a ""cheat day"" where I will go out to dinner or breakfast with a friend and order whatever I want.

My liver still feels quite irritated and uncomfortable.  A heating pad helps, but I also take buperenorphine for pain so most of the time it doesn't bug me.

I'll sit back and listen and learn! I appreciate your input and honest help here!  I had some cool charts to show my LFTs declining but no images allowed haha

I must disclose that the moment it gets hot I am team short shorts, thin tank tops, flip flops. No necessity of extra tissue covering my body that is already sweating profusely. 
In my native city, Barcelona, this hardly warrants a stare. I have noticed than in other places people would innerly judge but whatever, they were trying to repress it. 

So as much as I really have liked Vietnamese attitude in general, this country is a festival of how much can everyone express with facial expressions and how longer can they stare at something 😂 From the lady at the coffee store that takes my order doing a head-to-toes look, prepares the coffee while looking and smiling and hands the coffee with a second fully body check folllwed by a smirk, to a group of teenagers opening the eyes, signaling to me and then laughing out loud, to a full restaurant of women looking at me with a smile and no blink for 5-10s. I usually look back and smile, or reproduce the same they did, pointing at them and laughing, etc. But I don't want to offend anyone, and I am starting to think it is on me. On the other hand, it is 33C and 65% humidity right now in HCMC. Why add more warmth to what there is. I might be imagining things, and the clothing might not be the issue. But I am not imagining everyone staring and smiling forever, specially since they are so not subtle about it.
Travelling solo and the last month I felt like all eyes are on me for so long 😅 it starts to feel intimidating. Did anyone have the same impression? Am I exaggerating?

PS: When it was cold and I was fully covered I would also get long stares. Just not the rather extreme version of it with laughing afterwards. ",0,1740047234.0,VietNam,56,0.47,False

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) . I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation* ( mega important ) let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this while while having a smoke and watching Dutch streamers react too a show called “lang leve de liefde”   .sometimes I’m funny but don’t ask me to tell a joke ( that’s not how it works bro ) fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream( no I don’t have reasons why I just don’t , it’s not that deep ). I have adhd and think about a million thoughts a second it feels like . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

- Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning 🫶🏻)
- a lot of random playlists I’ve made

1itvgh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/1itvgh6/infection_according_to_ultrasound_but_not_culture/,"Infection according to ultrasound, but not culture","Sigh. I (trans male, he/him, 22) have been battling with urinary symptoms for SIX MONTHS with little to no relief. I've done swabs (everything negative, yes, even mycoplasma and ureaplasma), i've done three ultrasounds, so so so many cultures. The cultures always come back negative, but the ultrasounds has shown ""crystals"" according to my gyn. After the last negative culture, she told me to see a urogynecologist  to see if they can help. I'm desperate. I NEED to work, but I can't work in this condition, because every time I need to stay out of the house for more than twenty minutes I need to stop drinking completely two hours prior and when I start drinking again the burning is insane. My social life is so bad now, I haven't seen some of my friends in more than three months and the ones I see often are really really worried. My sex life is all over the place, this has destroyed my libido. I can't enjoy intimacy the same way anymore and it's really affecting me. I've got depression again.

I have no idea what to do anymore. The visit with the urogynecologist is so expensive, and it's just a visit. They will just tell me which tests to run and send me home with a bill that's going to be incredibly heavy on my bank account since, again, I've been out of work for 6 months and I've had to pay more than 500€ trying to cure this thing because my parents rarely help me. I'm desperate at this point.

Has anyone ever had this problem? My symptoms are burning when peeing, frequency and urgency, and sometimes burning in general. The ultrasound shows crystals(i'm not sure if they're stones). I'm getting another culture done on Saturday, just in case. Please Please Please if you know anything please help me. I've tried D-mannose, I've tried probiotics, I've tried antibiotics, I've tried cream, I've even tried estrogen cream but it was making the situation worse and very uncomfortable for me. I'm not on any birth control. My boyfriend and I have ALWAYS used condoms. I don't smoke, I don't drink coffee nor alcohol. No idea what to do anymore. I've tried elimination diet too to see if it was IC but nothing changed.",2,1740047179.0,Healthyhooha,2,1.0,False
