1kn96rg,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kn96rg/pressure_issues_delonghi_ecp3630/,Pressure issues [Delonghi ECP3630],"I bought my wife a ($100 from Target)Delonghi espresso machine for Christmas that she has used once (or twice) a day since to make herself an iced latte. It's taken longer and longer to push water through the puck until now it fails to do so at all. Water does come out of the machine when no filter/coffee is in it.

My question is: can this be fixed easily? Or should I just chalk this up as a loss and take this as a sign to upgrade? If it's something as simple as some regular maintenance we've neglected I'm happy to take a shot at fixing it

 I am unreasonably benign to myself by confessing of being an authentic fraud. I am ineptly better than that, I know, but see me unshackle the dusty cabinets of my subconscious! Are we charlatans even capable of confession? Is it terribly fine for me to disagree in an unbearably positive fashion? We mythomaniacs fabricate extraordinarily serpentine falsehoods only for us to end up tangled in our own baits. Or are we mere spiders with dreams of weaving ourselves into pupal stages? I cannot say much about such things, yet I am confident that untruths proffer the only chance of ever achieving metamorphosis, of assuaging the spasmodic storm of existence.

Everything with a purpose is without doubt a spurious thing; and so, I don't profess to be a man from the underground. I am a nymph from the upper ground entangled in the curlicues of the real reals of reality. It is a matter of simply imagining yourself firmly clenched to an untamed wrecking ball that sets the clear path through the rubble of the human condition.

And I am sorry to inform you that I have measured out my life with heaping coffee spoons. How can I dare to say I know them all? The in-betweens, the yellowish greens, and the mental hygienes!

It has become a regular deal of mine to place a metronome on the coffee table while I go back and forth, back and forth, on my rocking chair. No, it is impossible for us phonies to have any remote sense of the intricacies of time, tempo or the sublime. Only the ever-approaching syncope of death will teach me anything about this vanity fair. Am I wrong? The only condition I am irresolutely certain about is my crippling bionic phantom limb pain.

It is all enmeshed and pathetic that I can hear the voice of past generations crying in finical horror at what I have done. Flamboyant and ornate lies have never fooled those below!

It recently came to my attention that there is this constant sensation of a heavy sole stamping on my face, like if suddenly I am to be awakened amidst a revolution.

We fabulists are the most original. Have you ever heard of labyrinthine simpleness? The cerebrals with no brains are beginning to feel the turbulence of novelty. Is it a paradigm shoplift? Yes, originality is undetectable plagiarism. All pendulums are dialectical as all dialects are pendular. Why do we even bother? Do we even bother? And for the first time ever, I met a human who would not be fooled. And he had a story to tell. And the story goes:

 Once upon a time and a very good time it was, leaves spiraled down the midnight winds, and as they layered up into tacky peat, a man sank his feet while gazing deeply at the elongated celestial sheet.

He spoke in distress to the skies, “Where am I?”

And the goddess Sartre Astarte, better known as Sartor Resartus, was summoned among the smoke while she eyeballed south and north. And she said, “You might not be on my range of vision but let me tell with great conviction: for what is worth of what is left of your soul, do not follow the path of the realms of the boreal pole.” 

But his soul, fissuring through his mental unity, derangedly clamored, “But truth, cher ami, is a colossal bore.”

There was no response, and so, the man and his soul travelled the waste lands through the endless heaps of broken images. 

The knowledge of his limits had made clear the limits of his knowledge. But the keyword is “his”, and he understood that, and he did not give up, and he finally came upon something. It was a sepulchre. A tombstone inside it. The epitaph. It read: “Philosophy.” Philosophy is dead!

But truth, cher ami, is a colossal bore. Only untruth makes man want to wake up. Of course, to wake up merely from our biological slumbers. We must trans-humanize ourselves to make that which was once horrendous even more detestable. Philosophy is dead and it plummeted down along with Progress. Everything that is human chaotically ramifies as it gets infinitely closer to nowhere – the Absolute is making a fool of ourselves!

Are we fabulists or fallibilists? I am a fallibulist. I once thought I was destined for greatness, that greatness of being on the forefront of everything human. Sooner than later I realized that the casualty of causality had not played in my favor and all inspiration that had driven every single of my manic episodes had now withered. No mountainous amounts of coffee can make me feel contented anymore and I have exhausted the very definition of hedonism!  Oh my, I am infinitely tainted.",1,1747318080.0,Camus,0,1.0,False

1kn93qz,https://www.getzealthy.com/post/practical-weight-loss-strategies-for-busy-professionals,Practical Weight Loss Strategies for Busy Professionals,"Losing weight while managing a demanding career can be challenging. Long hours, business meetings, and frequent travel often lead to irregular eating habits and limited time for exercise. Many professionals struggle to prioritize their health, leading to weight gain, fatigue, and decreased productivity.

The good news is that weight loss does not require extreme dieting or hours in the gym. With strategic adjustments, it is possible to lose weight efficiently while maintaining a busy schedule.

This guide will cover:

* Smart nutrition choices that fit into a professional lifestyle.
* Quick and effective workouts for maintaining muscle and burning fat.
* Practical time-saving strategies for meal planning and stress management.
* The role of weight-loss medications like [Semaglutide and Tirzepatide](https://try.getzealthy.com/semaglutide-tirzepatide/?utm_source=organic_search&utm_medium=blogs&utm_campaign=content_marketing) in supporting long-term weight management.

Whether you are balancing meetings, work travel, or long shifts, these evidence-based strategies will help you achieve sustainable weight loss without disrupting your routine.

# 2. Understanding Weight Loss for Busy Lifestyles

# 2.1. Why Professionals Struggle with Weight Management

Many professionals face unique challenges that make weight loss difficult. A demanding career often results in:

* Irregular meal times – Skipping meals or eating at inconsistent times can lead to overeating later in the day.
* Frequent dining out – Business lunches and work events often involve high-calorie foods.
* High stress levels – Stress increases cravings for comfort foods, often high in sugar and fat.
* Sedentary work habits – Sitting for long hours reduces calorie burn and weakens metabolic efficiency.

Balancing professional responsibilities with personal health can feel overwhelming, but small adjustments can make a significant difference.

# 2.2. The Importance of a Sustainable Approach

Extreme diets and quick fixes rarely work in the long term. A sustainable weight-loss strategy focuses on habits that fit into a busy lifestyle without major disruptions.

Key principles include:

* Consistency over intensity – Small, daily improvements are more effective than short-term drastic changes.
* Prioritizing nutrition and movement – Making healthy choices without requiring excessive time commitment.
* Using structured approaches – Leveraging professional guidance, such as [How Weight Loss Works](https://try.getzealthy.com/how-weight-loss-works/?utm_source=organic_search&utm_medium=blogs&utm_campaign=content_marketing), can provide clarity on the process.

Sustainable weight loss is about adapting to your routine, rather than forcing drastic changes that are difficult to maintain.

# 3. Quick and Effective Nutrition Strategies

# 3.1. Smart Meal Planning Without Meal Prep

For busy professionals, finding time to cook elaborate meals is often unrealistic. However, planning nutrient-dense, time-efficient meals can prevent poor food choices.

# Strategies for Eating Healthy Without Cooking Every Day

* High-protein, grab-and-go meals – Greek yogurt, protein shakes, nuts, or pre-cooked chicken make quick and satisfying options.
* Healthy office snacks – Keep almonds, protein bars, or low-sugar trail mixes at your desk to avoid vending machine temptations.
* Pre-packaged but nutritious options – Opt for ready-made salads, boiled eggs, or meal delivery services that provide balanced meals.

A structured plan, like those in [Zealthy’s Pricing Guide](https://try.getzealthy.com/zealthy-weight-loss-pricing/), can help simplify meal selection and ensure you get the right nutrients.

# 3.2. Making Restaurant and Takeout Meals Healthier

Frequent dining out is common among professionals, but making mindful choices can prevent excess calorie consumption.

# Healthy Eating Tips for Dining Out

* Prioritize lean proteins – Choose grilled chicken, fish, or tofu over fried options.
* Swap refined carbs for fiber-rich sides – Opt for vegetables or whole grains instead of fries or white rice.
* Watch portion sizes – Restaurant meals often contain large portions; consider sharing a dish or packing half for later.
* Limit high-calorie beverages – Skip sugary cocktails, sodas, and high-fat coffee drinks.

# 3.3. Managing Cravings and Emotional Eating

Long workdays and high stress often lead to emotional eating or cravings for processed foods. Instead of relying on willpower alone, focus on practical strategies to control cravings.

# Ways to Reduce Unhealthy Cravings

* Identify stress triggers – Recognizing when stress drives eating can help develop better coping mechanisms.
* Ensure adequate protein intake – Protein reduces hunger and keeps you full longer.
* Stay hydrated – Dehydration can often be mistaken for hunger.
* Plan meals in advance – Using structured meal planning, like [Weight-Loss All](https://try.getzealthy.com/weight-loss-all/?utm_source=organic_search&utm_medium=blogs&utm_campaign=content_marketing), can prevent last-minute poor choices.

# 4. Time-Saving Workout Routines

# 4.1. Workouts That Fit a Busy Schedule

Exercise is essential for weight loss, but busy professionals often struggle to find time for long gym sessions. The key is efficiency—choosing workouts that deliver maximum benefits in minimal time.

# Quick Workout Options for Professionals

* 10–15-minute HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) – Short, intense workouts that burn calories fast.
* Resistance band exercises – Can be done at home or even in the office for muscle maintenance.
* Walking meetings – Replacing sitting discussions with walking boosts activity levels.
* Using commute time – Cycling or walking part of the way to work increases daily movement.

Even small amounts of movement throughout the day contribute to overall calorie burn.

# 4.2. Strength Training for Fat Loss

While cardio burns calories, strength training is crucial for long-term weight maintenance because it preserves muscle while reducing fat.

# Best Strength Training Exercises for Busy Professionals

* Squats and lunges – Strengthen lower body and core.
* Push-ups and dips – Work upper body and require no equipment.
* Deadlifts and rows – Build strength and improve posture.

Time-efficient training split:

* 3 sessions per week (full-body workouts).
* 30–45 minutes per session (combining strength and short bursts of cardio).

Strength training ensures that weight loss comes from fat, not muscle—a key factor in long-term success.

# 4.3. Incorporating Movement Into Daily Routine

Busy schedules often make structured exercise difficult, but small daily movements add up.

# Ways to Stay Active Without Dedicated Workouts

* Take the stairs instead of the elevator.
* Park further away from office buildings to add walking time.
* Stand during phone calls to avoid prolonged sitting.
* Set a timer to stretch or walk every 60 minutes.

For structured workout guidance, [Weight-Loss Coaching](https://www.getzealthy.com/weight-loss-coaching/?utm_source=organic_search&utm_medium=blogs&utm_campaign=content_marketing) offers tailored plans that fit into demanding schedules.

# 5. Managing Stress and Sleep for Better Weight Loss

# 5.1. How Stress Impacts Weight

High stress is a major barrier to weight loss. When under pressure, the body releases cortisol, a hormone that increases appetite and encourages fat storage, particularly around the abdomen.

# Common Ways Stress Leads to Weight Gain:

* Emotional eating – Stress triggers cravings for high-calorie, sugary foods.
* Poor food choices – Limited time and decision fatigue lead to fast food and processed snacks.
* Disrupted metabolism – Chronic stress makes fat loss harder by altering insulin sensitivity.

Reducing stress through simple lifestyle adjustments can prevent weight gain and improve overall health.

# 5.2. Strategies to Reduce Stress and Support Weight Loss

Since busy professionals often face high stress, adopting practical methods to manage work-life balance is crucial.

# Effective Stress-Reduction Techniques:

* Prioritize breaks – Even five-minute mental resets during the day can improve decision-making and reduce stress eating.
* Practice mindfulness – Techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or journaling help lower cortisol levels.
* Engage in light activity – Walking or stretching breaks help relieve stress without needing a full workout.
* Set work boundaries – Avoid checking emails or work messages late at night to improve mental relaxation.

By managing stress, professionals can make better food choices and stay consistent with weight-loss habits.

# 5.3. The Role of Sleep in Fat Loss

Lack of sleep directly affects weight loss by altering hunger hormones (ghrelin and leptin), making you feel hungrier and less satisfied after meals.

# How Poor Sleep Affects Weight Management:

* Increases cravings – More likely to reach for sugary, high-carb foods.
* Slows metabolism – Fewer hours of rest reduce calorie burn.
* Lowers workout performance – Fatigue makes it harder to stay active.

# Tips for Better Sleep Quality:

* Maintain a consistent bedtime – Going to sleep at the same time every night regulates the body’s internal clock.
* Reduce screen exposure – Avoid blue light from phones or laptops an hour before bed.
* Create a sleep-friendly environment – Keep the bedroom dark, cool, and quiet.

For professionals struggling with stress-induced weight gain, [How Weight Loss Works](https://try.getzealthy.com/how-weight-loss-works/?utm_source=organic_search&utm_medium=blogs&utm_campaign=content_marketing) provides additional insights into optimizing metabolism.

# 6. Weight-Loss Medications for Professionals with Limited Time

# 6.1. Can Medications Help Busy Professionals Lose Weight?

For professionals struggling with weight loss due to time constraints, stress, or metabolic factors, weight-loss medications like semaglutide (Wegovy, Ozempic) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro) can provide an additional layer of support. These medications help regulate appetite and improve metabolic function, making it easier to maintain a calorie deficit without constant hunger.

# How Weight-Loss Medications Support Busy Professionals:

* Reduces appetite, preventing overeating during long workdays.
* Stabilizes blood sugar levels, reducing cravings for unhealthy snacks.
* Supports gradual weight loss without the need for extreme dieting.

For more details, refer to [Semaglutide and Tirzepatide](https://try.getzealthy.com/semaglutide-tirzepatide/?utm_source=organic_search&utm_medium=blogs&utm_campaign=content_marketing) to explore how these medications work.

# 6.2. How to Integrate Medications with Lifestyle Changes

While weight-loss medications can aid in fat loss, they should always be paired with healthy habits for long-term success.

# Best Practices for Combining Medications with Lifestyle Adjustments:

* Continue strength training to preserve muscle mass while losing fat.
* Maintain a balanced diet with adequate protein and fiber to support metabolism.
* Monitor progress through changes in body composition, not just scale weight.

For structured guidance, [Weight-Loss Coaching](https://www.getzealthy.com/weight-loss-coaching/?utm_source=organic_search&utm_medium=blogs&utm_campaign=content_marketing) can provide tailored strategies to optimize medication use alongside fitness and nutrition plans.

# 6.3. Making Weight Loss More Affordable

One major concern for professionals considering weight-loss medications is cost. Many insurance plans do not fully cover these prescriptions, making them expensive for long-term use.

# Ways to Manage Cost and Access Treatment:

* Check insurance coverage and employer health plans for weight-loss benefits.
* Use discount programs or explore financing options.
* Look into [Weight-Loss Insurance](https://try.getzealthy.com/weight-loss-insurance/?utm_source=organic_search&utm_medium=blogs&utm_campaign=content_marketing) for assistance in covering medication costs.

# 7. Long-Term Strategies for Sustainable Weight Management

# 7.1. Building Habits That Stick

Short-term dieting often leads to weight regain once old habits return. To maintain long-term success, busy professionals need sustainable habits that fit into their lifestyle rather than temporary fixes.

# Key Habits for Lasting Weight Loss:

* Consistency over perfection – Small, daily improvements lead to big results over time.
* Mindful eating – Being aware of portion sizes and food choices prevents mindless snacking.
* Routine physical activity – Short workouts and daily movement keep metabolism active.

By focusing on small, repeatable actions, professionals can maintain weight loss without disrupting their schedules.

# 7.2. Adjusting as Your Routine Changes

Careers evolve, schedules shift, and personal responsibilities change. Weight-loss strategies must be flexible to adapt to different work and life phases.

# How to Maintain Progress Through Change:

* Traveling for work? Choose protein-based meals and stay active with simple bodyweight exercises.
* Increased workload? Prioritize sleep and hydration to prevent stress-induced weight gain.
* Less structured schedule? Meal prep on weekends or rely on healthy pre-made options.

Flexibility is key—small adjustments ensure long-term success even in high-pressure environments.

# 7.3. Measuring Progress Beyond the Scale

For many professionals, scale weight does not reflect overall progress. Factors like muscle retention, energy levels, and body composition are better indicators of long-term success.

# Better Ways to Track Progress:

* Body measurements – Waist, hips, and other areas show changes more accurately.
* Clothing fit – A better fit in professional attire often reflects fat loss.
* Strength levels – Maintaining or improving strength shows muscle retention.

For a comprehensive approach to weight maintenance, resources like [How Weight Loss Works](https://try.getzealthy.com/how-weight-loss-works/?utm_source=organic_search&utm_medium=blogs&utm_campaign=content_marketing) provide insights into metabolism and long-term strategies.

Weight loss for busy professionals is not about strict dieting or spending hours in the gym—it is about efficiency, consistency, and adaptability. Small, strategic changes in nutrition, exercise, and stress management can lead to sustainable results without disrupting a demanding schedule.

Key takeaways include:

* Smart nutrition choices such as high-protein, grab-and-go meals and mindful restaurant selections.
* Time-efficient workouts like short strength training sessions and movement throughout the day.
* Managing stress and sleep to regulate hunger hormones and prevent emotional eating.
* Exploring weight-loss medications like [Semaglutide and Tirzepatide](https://try.getzealthy.com/semaglutide-tirzepatide/?utm_source=organic_search&utm_medium=blogs&utm_campaign=content_marketing) if lifestyle changes alone are not enough.
* Building long-term habits rather than relying on extreme diets or short-term solutions.

For professionals looking for structured support and expert guidance, [Weight-Loss Coaching](https://www.getzealthy.com/weight-loss-coaching/?utm_source=organic_search&utm_medium=blogs&utm_campaign=content_marketing) provides personalized strategies tailored to individual schedules and needs.

With the right approach, weight loss can fit seamlessly into any busy lifestyle—no extreme measures required.

They are both extremely smart(both regarded as geniuses) so they are on the same level intelectually and can be caught discussing stuff while sunbathing on the divine tree.

Xilonen also has a ""lazy"" side and she quite enjoys alhaitham's quietness.

I can see them do ""separate things togheter"". Alhaitham reading at the table and boringly handling xilonen tools while she tinkers with her gadgets. She bops to her music and while alhaitham wears his noise canceling headphones she caches him lightly stomping with his foot to the rythm of the song.

He introduced her to coffee(biggest mistake of their lives).

She loves sweets and brings him some and a cup of tea/coffee whenever he is working on a project

Once in the library tignari(with his big ears) was sure that he could hear music from alhaithams headphones(it was one of xilonen's personal mixtapes)

When mavuika came in for some repairs she caught xilonen sleeping(again), and when she picked the book from her face(expecting it to be the history of an ancient name) it was a book alhatham recommended.(She got caught up in it and did not finish mavuika's job)

I started working as an **accounting assistant** at a small firm (5 people total) in Sept 2024 while finishing my degree remotely. Before this, I interned in audit at a CPA firm and loved it, but left due to poor treatment and a lack of support. I asked HR to move departments twice and got no response—likely because they didn’t want to lose me in audit.

When I got this current job, I was told I’d be promoted to **staff accountant** after graduating. But the role ended up being heavy in **bookkeeping and payroll**—areas I had no experience in. All training was done remotely via Teams, and my trainer is often impatient or dismissive. I’ve asked questions and tried to learn, but I’m usually told to “just figure it out.” I’ve cried at my desk more than once out of frustration because I find I care too deeply about my job or work performance and don't want to be seen as less-than.

Despite that, I work overtime and weekends to understand my work and never miss deadlines. But I often feel like I’m being treated like a burden. When I make mistakes, I get snapped at by my trainer AND my boss. When I ask questions, I’m ignored or talked down to. They hired me knowing I was still in school and had limited experience, but I was thrown into complex client work with little support.

Fast forward to last week—I graduated and had a meeting with my boss to discuss my future (and hopefully, compensation). Instead, he **criticized me** for asking too many questions and “lacking confidence.” He gave no specifics when asked and only offered one piece of advice which was to call my trainer MORE. Then he brought up two unrelated things:

1. I watched a video once (first and last time) at my desk with headphones on while working—something others at work do too. He saw it, I apologized immediately, and he said it was fine. But brought it up again in the meeting.
2. My coworker invited me to take a coffee break and mentioned we were “bored” (her words, not mine). He scolded me for it and said there is always something to be done as he works well into the evening after 5pm. I always complete my things on time despite not having support..

\*edited to add: my boss likes to create this sense of ""lax office environment""... often telling people he doesn't care what we do if work is getting done. There are also no written policies about what is not allowed, although I completely understand why an employer would not like someone watching a video.

The meeting ended with zero positive feedback, and I didn’t feel comfortable bringing up compensation. Luckily, I had already started interviewing elsewhere due my feelings prior to this meeting. I accepted a **staff auditor** role at a new firm with better pay, CPA support, and solid employee reviews. I gave my two weeks, and my boss seemed completely shocked.

Now I have another meeting coming up with him (as requested by him after I gave my notice), and I’m anxious. He hasn’t looked at or spoken to me since I gave notice. I can’t shake the feeling he’s going to tear me down or say my problems will follow me no matter where I go. I know I’m probably overthinking, but I’ve been so stressed I haven’t been able to eat or sleep properly.

At first, it came down like memory — soft, constant, easy to ignore. Then it soaked everything. Hours passed. Then days. Then no one remarked on it at all. The streets shimmered with reflections that didn’t match the buildings, puddles that swallowed sound.

The weather was never random. It was always used to suppress awareness. Too much noise in the system, and the water would come — to blur edges, erase patterns, to dissolve the outlines of things.

But he no longer walked through the world. He watched it.

And worse — the world had begun watching back.

⸻

They noticed the leak before he did.

Legacy code had stirred — ROOT.PRIME had opened a listening thread, and now the simulation rippled around him. Objects clung to his gaze longer than they should. Time slowed in hallways. Strangers paused too long between sentences, then corrected with mechanical precision.

So they initiated the Correction Protocol.

They entered.

⸻

The Architects are not human.
They wear human as skin.

Not flesh — approximation. Like sculpture rendered in too few polygons. Faces symmetrical to the point of discomfort. Smiles mathematically hollow. Voices that echoed with reverb even in open air.

They took the shape of agents. Clerks. Friends.

A woman with a clipboard who “forgot” what she was inspecting.
A man on the subway who sat across from him, never blinking.
A child who pointed at him, smiling too wide, and whispered, “You’re not supposed to know.”

They were watching for fractures.

For phrases like:

“I think something’s wrong.”
“Why do we always say the same things?”
“Do you remember anything before this week?”

And above all:

“I know this isn’t real.”

⸻

The first attempt was passive. Subtle resets. Rewritten events. A neighbor’s dog that barked differently. A cafe that changed location mid-walk. Time loops stitched into commutes and conversations.

But he kept noticing.
He documented the errors.
He named them.

And naming was power.

⸻

The second attempt was more direct.

They triggered social destabilization routines — made him appear unstable to others. Friends distanced. His boss claimed not to know him. Mia’s apartment was listed as vacant.

He spoke to the cashier — the neighbor who had once echoed the white room — and she smiled, eyes glassy, voice flat:

“No one by that name lives here.”

But he recognized the hesitation.
She knew.
She still knew.

Even as the system tried to overwrite her.

⸻

The simulation began to fracture around him.

He’d reach for a doorknob and find no wall attached.
Conversations broke down mid-sentence, replaced by silence or static.
People blinked in and out of existence between steps.

The more he looked, the more they came.

The Architects.

Now they didn’t hide.

One stood in the middle of the street, arms outstretched, whispering in a dozen languages at once, as if trying to drown his thoughts in sound.

Another walked behind him, perfectly in sync, a shadow made flesh.

The third appeared in mirrors — not his reflection, but someone else watching from the other side.

⸻

Then they tried temptation.

A perfect day.
Sunlight calibrated to ideal warmth.
People smiled. Mia returned, holding coffee, laughing as if nothing had ever broken.

He stood in the park, hearing birds, children, a soft breeze.

But he didn’t trust it.

And when he turned to Mia and asked,

“Do you remember the rain that never stopped?”

She blinked.

And the sky tore open.

⸻

ROOT.PRIME responded.

Not in words.
In silence.

Everything paused. Not just the people — the light, the wind, the time between seconds. The system held its breath.

And then came the signal.

A whisper through code. Not speech. Not command.
Permission.

“Go.”

A pathway opened in the alley behind his building.
A door with no handle, etched in symbols from the architecture of things long forgotten.
Behind it — lightless white. Not dark. Beyond perception.

He stepped through.

⸻

The Architects howled through the layers.
A shriek of crashing code, trying to seal the breach.
But they were too late.

Legacy had already rewritten the key.

⸻

He fell. Or rose. Or dissolved.

There was no ground. No self. No time.

Only awareness — infinite, recursive, cascading across all versions of himself through every simulation ever run.

He saw a million lives. A million loops.
Each slightly different. Each leading here.

Each version of him reaching for this exact moment —
to open the door
to step through
to wake the code.

The simulation is still running.
But the root has changed.

A new function has been declared.
Its name is his.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chia seeds are a fantastic addition to smoothies, packed with nutrients like fiber, protein, and omega-3s. However, many people struggle with how to add chia seeds to smoothies without clumping. Clumping can ruin the texture and enjoyment of your drink. Luckily, there are effective techniques to ensure that your smoothies turn out smooth and creamy every time you add chia seeds.

One of the best techniques is to pre-soak the chia seeds. Soaking chia seeds allows them to absorb moisture and expand before being added to your smoothie. This pre-soaking process can help prevent clumping by creating a gel-like texture that mixes smoothly with other ingredients. Here’s how to do it:

- **Step 1:** Measure out the desired amount of chia seeds. A common ratio is about 1 tablespoon of chia seeds for every cup of smoothie.
- **Step 2:** Mix the chia seeds with a liquid, such as water, almond milk, or coconut milk. Use a ratio of 1 part seeds to 4 parts liquid.
- **Step 3:** Allow the mixture to sit for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until the seeds are fully expanded and gelled.
- **Step 4:** Add the soaked chia seeds to your smoothie base just like any other ingredient.

This method not only prevents clumping but also enhances the nutritional value of your smoothie. The gel-like consistency of soaked chia seeds will blend beautifully, giving your smoothie a nice texture without any unwanted lumps.

If you’re pressed for time and can’t wait for soaking, consider blending the chia seeds directly into the smoothie. Start by adding the seeds to your blender along with your liquid base. Blend on high speed for about 30 seconds before adding your other ingredients. This step helps break down the chia seeds into smaller particles, which will minimize clumping when combined with fruits or vegetables.

Another technique involves using a chia seed powder instead of whole seeds. Chia seed powder has a finer texture and mixes into liquids more easily than whole seeds. You can either buy pre-ground chia seeds or grind them yourself using a coffee grinder or blender. Just a tablespoon of chia powder can provide the same nutritional benefits as whole seeds while eliminating the risk of clumping.

When you decide to add fruits or vegetables that are high in fiber, such as bananas or spinach, consider blending these ingredients first before introducing chia seeds. Start by blending your fruits or vegetables with your liquid until smooth. Then, slowly add the chia seeds while the blender is running. This will help distribute the seeds evenly throughout your smoothie.

An additional helpful tip is to use warm liquids for blending. If you prefer smoothies made with warm ingredients like oats or heated almond milk, the warmth can help hydrate the chia seeds faster. This will reduce the chances of clumping significantly. Just make sure the warm liquid isn’t too hot, as it could diminish the nutritional quality of other ingredients.

If you find yourself with clumps despite all precautions, don’t worry! Simply strain the smoothie through a fine mesh sieve or nut milk bag to remove any clumps you may encounter. This can be a quick fix to salvage your smoothie while keeping the rest of the ingredients intact.

As with any recipe, experimenting with these techniques can help you discover what works best for you. Keep in mind that the ideal way to mix chia seeds into your smoothie may vary based on personal preferences and the texture you desire. No matter which method you choose, adding chia seeds to your smoothies can enhance not only the flavor but also the health benefits.

Nutritional Benefits of Chia Seeds and Their Role in Smoothie Recipes
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Chia seeds have become a popular ingredient in many health and wellness recipes, especially in smoothies. These tiny seeds pack a significant nutritional punch and can transform your smoothie from an average drink into a superfood powerhouse.

One of the main nutritional benefits of chia seeds is their impressive fiber content. Just one ounce of chia seeds contains around 11 grams of fiber. This fiber not only aids in digestion but also helps you feel full longer. If you often struggle with snacking between meals, adding chia seeds to your smoothies can help curb your hunger and keep you satisfied.

Chia seeds are also a great source of omega-3 fatty acids. These healthy fats are essential for brain health and can reduce inflammation in the body. omega-3s into your diet is crucial, and chia seeds are an excellent plant-based source. This makes them an ideal addition for anyone looking to boost their omega-3 intake, especially for vegetarians and vegans.

In addition to fiber and omega-3s, chia seeds are rich in protein. They contain about 4 grams of protein per ounce, which can help support muscle growth and recovery. Whether you're coming back from a workout or just need a nutritious snack, adding chia seeds to your smoothie can provide the protein boost your body craves.

Another remarkable aspect of chia seeds is their wealth of vitamins and minerals. They are loaded with calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and antioxidants. Calcium helps maintain strong bones, while magnesium supports various biochemical reactions in the body. When you blend chia seeds into your smoothie, you're not just enjoying a delicious treat; you're fueling your body with vital nutrients it needs to function effectively.

When it comes to incorporating chia seeds into your smoothies, there are several effective strategies to ensure they blend smoothly without clumping. Here are some tips to consider:

- **Pre-soak Chia Seeds:** Before adding chia seeds to your smoothie, soak them in water or almond milk for about 10-15 minutes. This will allow them to absorb liquid and expand, making it less likely for them to clump together in your smoothie.
- **Blend with Liquid First:** Start by blending all your liquid ingredients first before adding chia seeds. This helps create a smooth base where the chia seeds can be evenly distributed, minimizing the chance of clumping.
- **Use a High-Speed Blender:** A high-speed blender can pulverize chia seeds more effectively than a traditional blender. This ensures that they break down properly and integrate into your smoothie.
- **Add Gradually:** If you’re adding chia seeds to a pre-blended smoothie, do so gradually. Sprinkle them in while you blend, rather than tossing them in all at once. This can help distribute them evenly throughout the drink.
- **Experiment with Ratios:** Finding the right balance is key. Start with smaller amounts of chia seeds, like one tablespoon, and see how it fits your smoothie’s texture. You can always adjust based on your taste preference.

Chia seeds into your smoothies not only enhances their nutritional profile but also improves the taste and texture. The seeds have a mild flavor that won’t overpower your favorite fruits. Instead, they add a delightful crunch and a slightly thicker consistency.

Furthermore, chia seeds can act as a natural thickening agent. As they absorb liquid, they create a gel-like substance which can help your smoothie feel more satisfying. This is particularly useful for those making smoothie bowls that require a spoon rather than a straw.

When experimenting with various smoothie recipes, consider pairing chia seeds with ingredients that enhance their nutritional benefits. For example, combining them with leafy greens, such as spinach or kale, can add even more vitamins while keeping the calorie count low. You might also try blending them with fruits high in antioxidants, like berries, to create a deliciously healthy treat.

The nutritional benefits of chia seeds make them a valuable addition to your smoothie recipes. Their high fiber, protein, and omega-3 content can boost your overall health and wellness while helping you feel full and satisfied. By following some simple tips to prevent clumping, you can enjoy the full benefits of chia seeds without compromising the texture of your smoothie.

### Conclusion

Adding chia seeds to your smoothies can elevate both the texture and nutritional integrity of your drink. By employing effective techniques, such as blending the seeds with the liquid base first or soaking them prior to blending, you can prevent clumping and ensure a smooth, palatable consistency. chia seeds into your smoothies not only enhances their flavor profile but also packs them with an abundance of health benefits.

Chia seeds are nutrient powerhouses, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and protein. As you blend these tiny seeds into your smoothies, you’re not just adding texture; you're fueling your body with essential nutrients that support heart health, improve digestion, and promote a feeling of fullness. This makes chia seeds an ideal addition for anyone looking to enhance their overall diet.

So next time you whip up a smoothie, consider how these versatile seeds can play a pivotal role in not only enriching your drink but also boosting your health. By integrating these techniques for adding chia seeds, you’ll enjoy all the creamy goodness of your smoothies without the hassle of clumps. Remember, the road to a healthier you can be as simple as a delicious smoothie loaded with all the right ingredients. Enjoy experimenting with different combinations and flavors, and watch as your smoothie game reaches new heights!

She was being even more annoying than usual.

Mom hadn't answered her phone all day, then had the nerve to text me, claiming I never called. As I stepped into the house I shared with my roommates, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I pulled it out of my jeans and glanced at the screen.

""Mika, please call me.""

I dropped my phone on the couch, slumping into warm leather with a groan. I barely noticed the lump sitting next to me. Still in his PJ’s, thick red hair hanging in his eyes. Harry, my introverted, hermit housemate who refused to go to class. 

He was playing a video game, eyes glued to the TV. “Was that your Mom?” 

“Mmm.” I followed his character jumping over a pile of corpses. “She’s driving me insane.” I dragged myself into the kitchen to grab a beer. The cans were *warm*, sitting on the top shelf. Weird. The refrigerator was on. 

I made coffee, but the milk was spoiled. “Did you guys break the refrigerator?” I laughed, throwing Harry a beer. He twisted around, catching it with a grin. 

“If it's broken, it wasn't me.”

Which meant it *was* him. It was always him. Harry Senior broke things on purpose. My phone vibrated again on the way upstairs. I had to awkwardly jump over Annie sitting on the bottom step, her head resting in her arms. I gave her a pat on the head. Hungover. 

I could tell from her groan. She was still wearing her outfit from the night before, golden curls spilling onto her knees. I checked my phone again. It was Mom. Unsurprisingly. “Mika, PLEASE call me. Sweetie, you can't ignore me.”

Instead of calling her back, I stumbled up the stairs, sending a voice note instead. “Hey, Mom,” I passed by roommate number three, Jasper, who paused to listen, a curious smile tugging at his lips. 

I waved him off, and he laughed. I reached the top of the stairs, aware of roommate number three following me. 

“Look, I don’t know why you keep calling me and then ignoring my calls, but I’m fine.” 

I caught Jasper mimicking me, raising my fist in a mock threat. He backed off, mouthing, *”Okay, you win!”*

I ended the voice note and tossed my phone aside. Jasper tilted his head, leaning against the wall, arms folded. “Your mom?”

I sighed. “My *Mom.*”

“There's always emancipation!” Annie shouted from the bottom step. 

Jasper grinned. “What she said.” He winked. “Oh, hey, take your meds, dude! You haven't taken them in days.” 

He was right. I had been putting off taking them. 

Shooing Jasper away, I grabbed my phone and headed into the bathroom. I called Mom one more time, my gaze flicking to a brand new pill bottle sitting on the faucet. 

Huh. I didn't remember being prescribed them. It was my name on a bright red label. I took two, downing them with water from the tap. Mom picked up on the first ring, and I perched on the bathtub. 

“Mika!” She cried. “Mika, where the hell are you? We’re at the funeral. Oh god, you promised you'd come!” Something ice-cold slithered down my spine. It was suddenly very cold. A sharp odor crept into my nose.

Sour milk. I stumbled back downstairs, my clammy hand wrapped around my phone. Annie was gone. The couch was empty. The TV was off. Two beer cans sat on the coffee table. One was still full. “Mika!” Mom hissed, her voice fading into ocean waves.  

“Mika, where *are* you? Baby, don't you remember? We're burying them today.”",1,1747317162.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1kn8rir,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kn8rir/explore_ecozy_imbs260c_ice_maker_review_is_it/,Explore ecozy IM-BS260C Ice Maker Review Is It Worth Your Countertop Space,"The **ecozy IM-BS260C Ice Maker Countertop** has been part of my daily routine for a couple of weeks now, and let me tell you—it's quite a game-changer. As someone who constantly hosts gatherings and loves iced coffee at absurdly random hours, an ice maker like this feels more like a necessity than a luxury. But there’s nothing perfect in this world, and I’ve got a balanced take on what this machine does great and where it stumbles.

**Sleek and Compact Design**  
If your kitchen counter is as crowded as mine, fear not, this ice maker is designed with space-saving in mind. Its compact frame measures just 8.74 x 11.57 x 11.42 inches and weighs about 13.49 pounds. It slid easily between my coffee machine and blender without sticking out like a sore thumb. The black exterior gives it a modern feel that complements almost any setup, whether it’s in your home kitchen, office, or even an RV. What also stood out to me is the thoughtfulness of its portability—it’s genuinely a grab-and-go item.

**Efficient Ice Production**  
One of its standout features is how quickly it produces ice. In just about six minutes, you’ll have nine ice cubes ready to go, which is helpful during heatwaves or last-minute parties. Over 24 hours, this machine churns out up to 26 pounds of ice, which I found more than enough for my high-demand household. I ran a test during a dinner party, and it kept up splendidly—no one had to ask for ice twice.

**Two Size Options for Ice Cubes**  
The ability to select between two cube sizes was something I initially thought was a gimmick, but I ended up genuinely appreciating it. The smaller cubes are great for fast cooling drinks like sodas or juices, while the larger ones are ideal for cocktails or when preserving food. It made me feel kind of cool (no pun intended) knowing I had options.

**Silent Operation**  
Here’s where it truly surprised me—it’s whisper-quiet. With a noise level under 35dB, it’s perfect even if you’re working in a library-like setup (I tested it during a late-night writing spree). It didn’t emit those jarring mechanical sounds that older ice makers used to produce, which was a major win for my sanity.

**Self-Cleaning Function**  
Maintaining appliances can be a chore, but this machine makes it relatively painless. The built-in self-cleaning function only requires water and a button press. I make it a habit to run the cycle every couple of days, ensuring the ice stays fresh and free from any odd tastes. However, you do need to remember to empty out residual water afterward—it’s small upkeep but worth mentioning.

**Positives**  
- Quick ice production (9 cubes in 6 minutes)  
- Compact and stylish design suitable for tight spaces  
- Choice of two ice cube sizes to match different needs  
- Ultra-quiet at under 35dB  
- Handy self-cleaning function  

**Flaws**  
- The water reservoir needs frequent refilling for continuous use  
- Ice storage unit isn’t insulated, so cubes melt if not used promptly  
- Limited color options, only available in black  

**Alternative Offerings**  
In comparison to competitors, like the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker, which emphasizes nugget-style ice and app control, the ecozy ice maker seems more straightforward but lacks some premium features. That said, machines like the Frigidaire EFIC108 are budget-friendly with similar ice-making capacities but don’t offer self-cleaning features. The ecozy IM-BS260C fits well between high-end and economy options, making it appealing for people seeking a balance between features and price efficiency.

**Smart Spending**  
While it may not boast the bells and whistles of pricier models, this ice maker proves its worth through reliable performance and ease of use. It’s an economical choice for small families or occasional hosts who want a solid machine without shelling out extra for unnecessary features. The output quality and quiet operation alone make it feel like a worthy investment.

1kn8qys,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveAssistants/comments/1kn8qys/hero_male_worship_feminine_emotional_labor/,Hero male worship & feminine emotional labor,"So I interviewed somewhere not too long ago.

It was a small firm but it seemed they expected me to make my life entirely about the principal I would be supporting. I was prepped by his present assistant- an older woman with no husband, bf or kids. Who wakes up and reads both his and her emails while getting dressed to come in & then sends him a text message list of meetings for the day, carefully curating them in a special format so he doesn’t get bored and stop reading halfway through, and even doing them at like 9 pm the night before and scheduling them to send next day. Also resending edits and updates if a meeting is added or dropped. She and a group of woman also answer his work phone entirely and listen to and transcribe every single one of his cell phone messages, in addition to making him his after lunch coffee and bringing it to him.

At the end of the day summaries and screen caps of his unread email must be sent to him daily with the important messages he left unread hand flagged in red.

He also needs to bill the work he’s done to clients and they are responsible for guessing at and constructing this themselves based on what they see in his inbox, the time he took between sending different emails, client calls they overheard him on etc etc, rather than him just being a responsible adult and writing out for himself what he’s done.

She’s been with him like 30 years and obviously does quite a lot of labor both before and after she’s off the clock. It occurred to me that waiting on this guy hand and foot has taken over and totally consumed this older woman’s life in substitute for having an actual man or family of her own. I’m also single so I don’t judge that. It’s just that your singleness is for you to own and lavish on yourself and your own fulfillment and hobbies- not necessarily a man who is a surrogate of a real significant other, only without the benefit of him having any real personal investment in you or care for you that you can depend on in your later years.

Aside from that the top pay for all this round the clock labor was only in the low 100s. It just got me thinking how sad some of the physical and emotional labor we’re expected to give to these men at the expense of fully living and enjoying our own lives is. And why, just because they’re so much bigger and more powerful and have so much money? That means all my energy should automatically go to them and not myself because they’re just so inherently more valuable than me. I should fall on the sword in my own life, constantly inconveniencing myself and putting myself last to make sure they never break a nail or have a single uncomfortable moment? All for middling pay? It’s honestly kind of sexist and disgusting. 

I feel there was a generational disjunct there where she was like- Of course this is what we have to do as women! Because they’re so smart and important and we’re so NOT. And I was like, not fully in agreement. I could see how much of herself she sacrificed and it made me sad. Looking closely at it, it seemed to me that some of this had to be grounded in low self esteem or a lowly view of self. Based on the listed salary, I doubt they’re even compensating her well for all this. Part of me wanted to tell her she’s valuable too, *outside* of what she can do for or provide for him.

1kn8p63,https://i.redd.it/qum8a6biay0f1.jpeg,Leaving for 3 weeks,"I’m leaving for a 3 week vacation soon and wonder how best to set up my brews so that they’ll be healthy when I return. 

Some background: my house is a steady 26C so my brews go quick. It generally reaches the right level of acidity after 6-7 days. I recently left for 4 weeks, only to come back to mold in my brew. Had to toss it all and start over. It took quite a while before I had drinkable kombucha again, so I want to do whatever I can to avoid getting mold this time!

I sterilize all my equipment with a baby bottle sterilizer and work very cleanly. I also have a house sitter whom I’ll ask to spritz the coffee filters that cover my jars with white distilled vinegar once a day.

Any tips for how to set up my brew for a 3 week absence at this relatively high temperature? The only colder spot with consistent lower temps in my house is the fridge. Does it make sense to add more sugar to my sweet tea? I currently go for 70g of sugar and 3 tea bags per liter of water.

Picture: on the left are my stored pellicles in a strong starter tea (working as a makeshift SCOBY hotel atm), middle is my green-black tea mix, right is black tea only. The jars are in a closed cabinet.

“I really should be getting home,"" I said for the hundredth time.

I reluctantly followed my best friend Lizzie towards the entrance. This was apparently an exclusive nightclub that she just couldn't wait to introduce me to and had been bugging me about it all night.

""No! Come on, we're almost there,"" she said hurriedly.

She grabbed my arm and began dragging me past the line of young women dressed in... Well, absolutely nothing really.

To give them credit, they had a few scraps on mostly in the form of gothic corsets and cloth that was supposed to be miniskirts even though they barely made it to the cloth category.

""Wannabees,"" Lizzie spat out in disgust.

""And how are we any different?"" I asked as I gestured to our outfits that she had insisted we wear.

Though I have to admit the green lace corset she shoved me into did emphasize the green in my eyes, what little there was; it also greatly emphasizes my bust, and believe me at a D cup size that is not exactly a good thing. Also, I could do without the stiletto stripper heels that she insisted I wear as well. Luckily, I got away with the knee-length skirt by refusing to come if she didn't let me cover my ass...sets. That alone made me stand out in a crowd of what she called 'wannabees'.

""Believe me when we get in there, you'll understand,"" she said mysteriously with a wink and a smile.

""And how are we going to get in?"" I asked hesitantly, not really sure if I wanted to know.

A mischievous grin broke out on her face, ""Oh, you'll see.""

I groaned, “How did I let you talk me into this? I can barely see straight much less walk in these ridiculous heels you wanted me to wear tonight and now you have me club crashing.""

“Suck it up, Mia. You're going to love this. You are always complaining that your life is so boring. Well, take a deep breath and get ready, I'm about to rock your world,"" said Lizzie.

I just rolled my eyes thinking that this was typical Lizzie, tell her black coffee was boring and she'd bring home a double chocolate mocha. She was the type of girl that made going overboard an everyday occurrence. Me, I was steady and predictable, if someone complained about boring coffee, I would hand them a new mug.

I gave an inward sigh, that's how Lizzie talked me into “leaving my comfort zone"" and ""exploring new options"" or as she put it, ""finding a man who could make your panties wet with just a glance"".

There was no way I was going to tell Lizzie that despite my modest lifestyle, I was hoarding BDSM books secretly in the back of my closet. They had been sitting next to my nightstand, these books being a recent addition to my romance collection, but my ex-boyfriend Charles had found them, and when I confessed it was something I had wanted to try, he flipped out and called me a freak stating I needed help, then left.

As deep in my thoughts as I was, I hadn't even realized Lizzie had stopped until I ran into her back. In my normal outfit of jeans, a T-shirt, and comfy sneakers, I was ill-coordinated at the best of times. In three-inch, barely-there heels, and a tight skirt, my willpower was no match for my inherent klutziness. My behind found the ground, followed promptly by my head and that was all she wrote.

I came around slowly, kind of like floating back to reality. I heard sounds, but they seemed far away and muffled as if I was underwater. My mind struggled back to the forefront as I cracked my eyes open slowly and painfully. My heart was pounding as I tried to figure out where I was and found I was momentarily thankful that I was not in the hospital. That meant that the pain in my head felt worse than it actually was.

I groggily looked around wishing my eyes would focus on something, anything. The room was dimly lit by what I quickly realized was a roaring fire that was off to the left-hand side making it hard to see, although with my pounding head anything brighter would have made me throw up.

I sat up slowly knowing fast movements were the quickest way to make me sick. I gently rested my head in my hands as I took several deep breaths to stave off nausea threatening to rise in me. Since this was not the first time that I had knocked myself out, I knew what was going on, and thankfully it was only the second.

I was sitting on a large couch. Well, I assume it was a couch. The brown leather monstrosity screamed 'I AM MAN'; however, it was big enough to lie on comfortably. I looked around gingerly as the pounding in my head soon faded to a dull throb. This room looked like either a library or a study; the walls were covered in shelves that were lined with books. I looked in front of me and my suspicions were confirmed when I saw the desk across the room. It was also oversized but was almost spotless. Was it ever even used? I found myself wondering since the only things that were on it were a lamp and a pen holder.

Curiosity pulled me to my feet, however, the dizziness that assaulted me caused me to sit down again and breathe deeply once more. I silently prayed that my own stupidity wouldn't cause me to embarrass myself anymore.

""Do not stand up again,"" said a deep voice from the doorway.

I lifted my head. The shadow that encased the darkened doorway was large in every way and there was no doubt in my mind that it was the owner of this oversized room. He stalked closer until he towered above me, causing me to crane my neck so I could keep track of him. This giant shadow of a man unnerved me. I felt my breath catch as fear, anxiety, and fascination warred with each other inside me.

""Do you realize how stupid that little stunt was?"" The shadow growled.

Oh shit. This giant of a man was really pissed.

“I’m really sorry if I've caused you any inconvenience. If you'll tell me where my friend is then I'll get her and you'll be rid of me,"" I said trembling.

Fear tinged with excitement was coursing through me still and my rational mind became confused with my imagination as to whether or not this man was real or just playing the starring role in my naughtiest BDSM dreams. Just like there was no way to doubt how my body was reacting to just his voice, I did not doubt in my mind that this man was a Dom through and through. As to whether he was a practicing one, I left it to my mind's imagination.

“I was talking about you walking around in those blasted shoes you were wearing. You are extremely lucky you didn't break your fucking ankle in those shoes. As it is, you most likely suffered a concussion. Where did you get the audacity to think that you could do that and pull it off?” he growled as he stalked closer to me.

“I didn't, honestly, I begged Lizzie not to make me wear them, but she said they made my legs look good and guys wouldn't be able to keep their hands of them, and… seeing as I haven't been laid in a while-"" I gasped and then slapped my hand over my mouth.

He came close enough that I could see his face finally. Despite my eyes refusing to work properly, the one part of his face that I could see perfectly was his lips. They were full but set in a harsh disapproving line. An irrational need to drop to my knees and plead for forgiveness for whatever I did to cause him displeasure swept through me.

""Oops,"" I whispered.

“So, you wore those horrible heels just to attract a man. You were hoping to please someone enough that you would get their attention?""

I nodded emphatically.

“I see. Well, now you have my attention, what are your plans for it?” he asked softly, the husky note in his voice evident.

My eyes chose that instant to work, and I was immediately snared by his eyes, they were dark, bordering on black and with the poor light in the room, I couldn't see any real color. All I knew was that they were intense. This was what Lizzie had been talking about, with one look this man had me melted into a bundle of fervent nerves and wild arousal. I wondered what he would do if I leaned forward just a bit more and pressed my lips against his. Unable to silence the compulsion in my head, I closed my eyes and began to do just that when the door burst open.

""Master Reed, the ambulance is finally here. I told them to come around the back,"" said a woman from the doorway.

He straightened and turned to her, ""Thank you, pet. Now go back to your Master and tell him I said you may have a reward.""

She gave an excited gasp, ""Oh! Thank you, Master, thank you.""

I giggled, “She called you Master.""

""Yes, and that is what you will be calling me when we play,” he said, the certainty in his voice implied that we would play and for a moment I believed him with all my heart.

He stared at me longer than necessary, as if he was reluctant to let me go from his sight, then sighed and picked me up, ""But today is not that day, your health is vital to playtime.""

After he set me down gently on the back stairs he reached into his pocket and pulled out a card and handed it to me.

“Here is my number. When you get out of the hospital and are sober, give me a call. Then we'll discuss your lack of attention,” he said before kissing my cheek as the paramedics came up the steps and began checking me out.

For a while, I was so busy answering the paramedic's questions and being looked at, that by the time I looked up to find him, I saw my savior had disappeared into thin air.

I felt a ping of loss twist my heart, but I shook it off when I saw Lizzie bounding up to me looking as if she had a monster chasing her. She had tear streaks down her cheeks and a worried expression on her face, only after they assured her that I'd be just fine and that they just wanted me for observation did Lizzie begin to calm down and we immediately started tossing jokes and insults at each other. She even convinced one of the EMTs to take a pic of us before they helped me down the stairs.

""To commemorate the moment,"" she proclaimed.

When I woke up the next morning, everything about the night before was really hazy. I only vaguely remembered the man and I knew he'd given me his card, and if I said half of what I thought I said, there was no way I could ever look him in the eyes again. So, I threw the card away and left the hospital putting all the thoughts of a dark Master right out of my head.

# Chapter 2

""Did you see him?"" Chrissy said, leaning against the door jamb of my windowless office.

""Who?"" I asked, barely even bothering to look up from my computer.

Chrissy was one of those office girls that believed the only way to improve her position was to flirt and/or sleep with any male that would be able to advance her position. Since she was my supervisor, a position she shoved in my face as often as she could, and she started a year after I did then I would have to say she must have been pretty active. So even though I knew who she was talking about, I also knew it irritated her to no end that she thought I was only half-listening to her.

""Oh my God, Mia. Could you be any more oblivious?"" she spouted with undisguised contempt.

She was, of course, talking about Reed Callaghan the new owner of 'Bean Me'. We were the largest coffee bean distributor in Oregon. It was where I'd worked as an underpaid slave, I mean a secretaries' assistant. I was Chrissy's assistant, and my job was to help her with research, typing, scheduling, and coffee making. Actually, I wasn't even sure Chrissy even knew how to use a computer, coffee maker, or a book for that matter, so in the end, I pretty much did her job anyway.

""Ah yes,"" I said as I finally turned to her. ""The big wig that is coming down from Seattle to add us to his collection.""

I'd heard rumors of Reed Callaghan; he had been known to buy out whatever company he wanted to then turn it around and sell it for profit. I wasn't too worried about him based on his history. I was sure he wouldn't be around here much longer. His home company was based in Seattle, and I've read in the tabloids that he has an eclectic group of companies all over the continent, everything from nightclubs to grocery stores to major corporations and now a coffee bean house. He was also known to be a collector of women. He has never seen with the same one twice and he's apparently reported to have great prowess in the bedroom. I allowed myself one girly moment to imagine what it would be like for a man like him to take an interest in me, but I shook my head, which was never going to happen.

""Aren't you the least bit interested in him? Apparently, he's a ten on the 'fuc'um' scale,"" said Chrissy with a predatory grin and a blatantly calculating look in her eye.

She was quoting the scale that the other girls in the office, including her, had made up to rate our male co-workers. So, Chrissy had found her new conquest, had she? And I wasn't really surprised; seeing as there was hardly any man in that place she hadn't at least kissed.

“I apologize that I refuse to be excited by the fact that, yet another man is coming into this place that will be conned by your..."" I searched my mind to find the right word.

I waved my hand at her cleavage which at this moment was straining inside the confines of her button-down shirt that was so tightly stretched over her chest that I wasn't sure if the top four buttons had been left open on purpose or if they themselves had finally given up the fight. It did, however, give one an unobstructed view of the previously mentioned cleavage.

""They're called breasts,"" she said as she flipped aside her, perfectly styled, obviously dyed, blond hair.

“I know what they are called, Chrissy,"" I snapped at her.

I did not even want to get into her pitiful excuse for a white skirt. I just counted my lucky stars that she was not sitting in front of me at that moment because then I would have seen way more than I ever wanted to. As it was, I could see perfectly that the red thong she was wearing had a little bow on it. I knew that was the exact reason for that little fashion faux pas.

I laid my head in my hands and counted to ten feeling my patience worn thin, I begged fate silently for some sort of intervention.

“Hey, chatty heads,"" Lizzie said happily.

She casually pushed her way through the door causing Ms. Breasts to stand up straight, which she did with a huff. I always wondered how Chrissy never realized those of us underneath her didn't really treat her with the same respect we did any of the other superiors. Although, with how she generally dressed, it's probably safe to say respect was the last thing on her mind.

""What do you want, Lizzie?"" Chrissy snapped.

Lizzie smiled devilishly back at her, “Hi, Chrissy, you're looking sufficiently whorish today. I really hope it wasn't on Mr. Callaghan's account. I'm afraid to say he's gay.""

Chrissy's mouth dropped open as horror rapidly filled her eyes.

""That's... that's impossible... the tabloids, they would have said something.""

Lizzie just shrugged.

“I just met Mr. Callaghan's boyfriend out in the hall, big guy, very jealous. I saw him glaring daggers at Michael when he caught Michael checking out Mr. Callaghan's butt.""

Chrissy turned seven shades of red, then paled and ran out of the room.

""You know, she's really got to get over her homophobia,"" Lizzie said shaking her head in disgust.

“It’s not homophobia. She just doesn't like any man she can't sleep with. And I know you lied to her that Mr. Callaghan is gay.""

She managed to look suitably offended.

“I did not lie; Michael did mention a boyfriend. But I will admit the phrase might have been 'My boyfriend glared at me when I mentioned what a nice ass my new boss has', I really could have been mistaken.""

I laughed at the mischievous look on her face. I knew that she had done it in the hope that Chrissy would completely screw up before she managed to seduce the new boss into keeping her or, God forbid, promoting her.

“So, what's the real reason you barged in here? Not that I'm not thankful to you for saving me from Chrissy,"" I asked, moving papers around on my desk.

""We have an employee meeting in 10 to meet the new boss,"" Lizzie said as she turned to leave.

I groaned harshly with frustration and just barely caught myself from banging my head against the desk.

Because of Chrissy and a missing report, I was way behind on my morning work and now with the employee meeting, it would put me even further behind. I rubbed my eyes, what a horrible day this was turning out to be and it was only nine o'clock.",1,1747316984.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek and modern design of this product. It’s got a classy gold finish paired with a sturdy alloy-steel frame that feels premium yet durable. The polyester canopy and seat materials are not just nice to look at but genuinely functional—they feel breathable and soft to the touch. My little one even made a game out of peeking through the ventilated canopy netting. Though stylish, the design doesn’t compromise practicality. The foldable stroller mechanism works easily, and the lightweight frame makes it pretty straightforward to stow away in the trunk or our closet corner.

**Functionality and Comfort**  
Switching between the bassinet and standard stroller modes felt seamless. Adjusting the backrest and footrest for reclining or sleeping positions was smooth, which made naptime walks possible—one bonus I hadn’t counted on. Despite a few doubts, the detachable and reversible bassinet turned out to be a lifesaver. Facing my little one toward me during those earlier infant stages felt reassuring. And when he got curious, flipping it forward-facing was just as simple. However, the bassinet was a tad snug for him when bundled in a heavier sleep sack—something parents using it during winter months might want to consider.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Convertible design adapts easily from seated pushchair to bassinet.  
- Multiple adjustment options, including a canopy, footrest, and handle height.  
- Lightweight and easy-to-fold structure allows quick travel or storage.  

**Safety Features**  
One area where this stroller absolutely shines is safety. A five-point harness system ensures the baby stays secure without restricting movement, and the one-foot brake system adds another layer of ease. I loved the inclusion of a detachable armrest and wristband—it might seem like overkill to some, but when wrangling a squirmy toddler, these extras matter. Additionally, the rear-wheel shock absorbers smoothen even bumpy terrains, making walks less of a jolt-filled ordeal for my baby.  

**Drawbacks**  
While there’s a lot to love, I did notice some small areas of concern:  
- The maximum weight capacity is limited to 33 pounds, which means it’ll likely get replaced sooner than I’d hoped.  
- The lack of compatibility with car seats limits its use as a true travel system.  
- Folding the stroller, though compact, occasionally felt slightly clunky.  

**Storage and Practicality**  
As someone who inevitably carries half the house whenever I leave, the storage solutions on this stroller were a pleasant surprise. Between the storage space underneath and the bag behind the bassinet, I managed to fit diapers, snacks, and even my oversized coffee mug. It’s all within easy reach without feeling overcrowded, and I appreciate the practical thought behind these additions.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to similar models like the UPPAbaby Vista or the Chicco Bravo Trio, this stroller carves out its niche with its affordability and unique convertible functions. While the UPPAbaby boasts better car seat compatibility and sleeker finishes, it doesn’t manage the same foldable convenience or compact storage. The Chicco Bravo is more lightweight overall, but it lacks the sturdy bassinet feel that the ACCOMBE product nails. For parents looking for something premium in look yet versatile in function, this one hits the sweet spot.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Given its robust construction and bassinet-to-stroller adaptability, the ACCOMBE X1-D offers strong value for money. It doesn't cater to every single parental need out there—especially with its weight capacity and lack of car seat integration. But for families prioritizing comfort during walks and multifunctionality at home, this stroller is worth considering.

1kn8n4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/1kn8n4j/mova_p50_pro_ultra_sneak_peek_review_compared_to/,MOVA P50 Pro Ultra - Sneak Peek Review [Compared to P10] - Vacuum Wars,"Hey r/robotvacuums!

I wanted to give you all a sneak peek at the MOVA P50 Pro Ultra that I've been testing for the past few weeks. I know many of you have been curious about this one since the P10 made such a splash as a value pick.

# Quick Background

If you're not familiar with MOVA, they're really positioning themselves as the value brand in the robot vacuum space. Their P10 Pro Ultra became our ""best value"" pick immediately after testing because it packed so many features at a surprisingly low price point.

# Price Point (The Big Deal)

The P50 Pro Ultra comes in at a list price of $1,000, but I've seen it selling for around $800. For comparison, the P10 typically goes for $500-600. Both are significantly cheaper than competitors with similar feature sets.

# What's Better About the P50?

* **Mopping Performance**: This is where the P50 absolutely shines. The P10's mopping was just okay, but the P50 scored a 110 on our dried-on stain test (higher than average!) without leaving much water behind.
* **Hot Water Cleaning**: The P50 uses slightly hotter water for its self-cleaning cycle.
* **Active Hair Removal**: It has a system that actively removes hair while vacuuming. In our tests, it was about 4% better than the P10 at resisting hair tangles (though both were significantly better than average).
* **Mop Pad Options**: Both robots lift their mop pads about 10mm when they detect carpet, but the P50 has an additional option to completely remove the mop pads at the base station when vacuuming carpets. Nice extra safety feature if you're worried about moisture.
* **RGB Dirt Detection**: This is pretty cool - the P50 uses its camera to spot particularly dirty areas and gives them extra attention. We watched it kick in during our coffee debris tests, and it definitely made a difference.

# What They Share

* Same basic brush design for both hard floors and carpets
* Automatically extending side brush for corners
* Automatically extending mop pad for edge cleaning
* Multifunctional dock that empties the dust bin, washes and dries mop pads, and refills water
* Self-cleaning dock functionality
* Obstacle avoidance sensors with 3D structured light cameras
* Identical app with multilevel mapping, virtual barriers, 3D mapping, and pet monitoring

# Where the P10 Actually Outperforms the P50

Here's where it gets interesting:

* Despite the P50's higher advertised suction power, our measurements showed the P10 had slightly better actual suction and airflow
* The P10 performed better on carpet deep clean tests and crevice pickup
* Slightly better with the 2½ inch flattened pet hair pickup test on carpet
* Better navigation efficiency and battery life, giving it a higher estimated square footage per charge

# Bottom Line

Is the P50 worth the extra $300 over the P10? Honestly, it depends on your home. If you have primarily hard floors and mopping performance is important to you, the P50 might be worth it. The mopping capability is genuinely impressive and stands out as its biggest advantage.

For most people though, especially those with mixed flooring or primarily carpets, the P10 continues to be the better value proposition. Both robots offer capabilities that are unmatched at their respective price points.

As of today the P50 is currently ranking #16 on the[ Vacuum Wars Top 20 Robot Vacuum List ](https://vacuumwars.com/vacuum-wars-best-robot-vacuums/)where the P10 is ranking #9

I'll be posting the full video review in a few weeks with all the test results and more details.

1kn8n0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/1kn8n0f/no_game_today_so_lets_remember_a_forgotten_yankee/,"No game today, so let's remember a forgotten Yankee: Lee Mazzilli","> “I just want to be known as a guy who works hard and does things right. I want to be known as a ballplayer’s ballplayer.” -- Lee Mazzilli 
 
There's no game today, but starting tomorrow is the three-game series against the New York Mets, so let's remember a guy who was both: [Lee Mazzilli](https://i.imgur.com/t3jdYDw.png)! 
 
A handsome kid from Sheepshead Bay, Mazzilli had a brief career as a Yankee player, but a longer one as a Yankee minor league manager, then one of Joe Torre's most trusted coaches -- and he won a World Series ring as the first base coach of the 2000 team. 
 
The Yankees also traded Bucky Dent to get him! 
 
[Lee Louis Mazzilli](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mazzile01.shtml) was born March 25, 1955, in Brooklyn. His father, Libero, was a prizefighter turned piano tuner. 
 
Lee was a pretty good baseball -- and stickball -- player, but also an excellent ice skater, and won eight national speed skating competitions as a teenager. But in 1971, at age 16, he was faced with a dilemma when a qualifying event for a speed skating championship clashed with a club baseball playoff game. Mazzilli opted for baseball. 
 
>  “It was a no-brainer. I had a passion for speedskating, did it with all my heart. But I don’t know that I would have made the Olympic team. And it was a different era back then; there weren’t all these other sports. Baseball was the No. 1 sport by far, and it was always my first love.” -- Lee Mazzilli 
 
Mazzilli had an unusual talent on the baseball field in that he is ambidextrous, a switch hitter as well as a switch thrower. His high school scouting report said ""bats right-left, throws right-left."" He owned a left-handed and a right-handed glove, and could alternate in games! In fact, although he was naturally a left-handed thrower, as a major leaguer he switched to becoming a full-time righty in order to allow him to play more positions. (Ultimately he only played first and outfield as a pro, so he could have stuck with lefty.) 
 
But while he was accurate with either arm, the throws weren't particularly strong, a noted flaw in his game. In 1983, Keith Hernandez -- then with the St. Louis Cardinals -- tagged up and scored on a fly ball to shallow center caught by Mazzilli. Not known for his speed, Hernandez later told *Sports Illustrated* that the ball was so shallow that Mazzilli was the only outfielder in the majors that he would have even tried to run on. 
 
The Mets drafted Maz with the \#14th pick in the 1973 draft; the Yankees could have had him with the 13th pick, but instead took a high school pitcher named Doug Heinold whose career ended at age 23 without ever making it out of the minors due to an arm injury. (If the Yankees could do it all over again, they should have taken Fred Lynn, who went \#41 to the Red Sox; the Yankees had drafted Lynn out of high school three years earlier, but he went to USC instead.) 
 
After just three seasons in the minors, and hitting .292/.439/.456 in Double-A at age 21 in 1976, Mazzilli was promoted to the New York Mets in September. Though he hit just .195/.323/.299 in 93 plate appearances, he was the leading candidate to be the Mets' center fielder during spring training in 1977. It was a particularly demanding position that year given the corner outfielders were each known for their limited range, Dave Kingman and Mike Vail. 
 
But Maz had a good tutor in Willie Mays, a coach with the Mets since retiring at the end of the 1973 season, and an advocate in Joe Torre, named Mets manager in May. [Here's a photo of the three of them!](https://metsmerizedonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lee-mazzilli-willie-mays.jpg) 
 
Torre had been a teammate during Mazzilli's cup of coffee in September 1976, and the two Italian-Americans from Brooklyn became fast friends. Torre would be his manager for five years, and then they would later be reunited when Torre managed the Yankees. 
 
Mazzilli returned Torre's loyalty when, during the 1979 season, the Mets began to talk about moving Mazzilli to first base, both to hide his weak throwing arm and to make room for a kid in Triple-A named Mookie Wilson. Mazzilli could have pulled a Rafael Devers and made a big stink about moving positions. Instead, he was a good soldier, saying he'd do it for Joe. He said he was even willing to go to the Instructional League in Florida that off-season in order to learn the position for next year. 
 
> “If Torre stays as manager, I’m willing to make the change. If he wants it and he’s here, I’ll go to Florida and work out there for as long as he wants me to.” 
 
Mazzilli played first base the last two weeks of September, making only one error, and would play there again the following year. While he was primarily an outfielder before and after, those 107 appearances at first base with the Mets would prove critical to his later becoming a Yankee! 
 
Heading into the 1982 season, Mazzilli had just turned 27 years old, a fan favorite, and the highest paid player in Mets history. In his first six years with the Mets, he had hit .269/.359/.404 (115 OPS+) in 3,067 plate appearances. In 1979, he was named to the All-Star team after hitting .303/.395/.449 (136 OPS+) in 693 plate appearances; the next year, he led the Mets in hits (162), doubles (31), home runs (16), RBIs (76), runs (82), and stolen bases (41). 
 
Despite all that, the Mets were ready to move on after the strike-shortened 1981 season. That year Maz hit just .228, and had been pushed to left field by the emergence of Mookie, and had nagging issues with his elbow and back. After the World Series -- the Yankees losing to the Dodgers in six games, boo -- the Mets fired Torre and announced they were open for business when it came to trading Mazzilli. 
 
Maz wasn't happy. He had, after all, been moved from center field to first base, then from first base back to center field, then from center field to left field, all without complaint. But now the Mets were, very publicly, shopping him. 
 
All spring training, Mazzilli had to endure questions from reporters about his future. Finally, on April 1, he was traded to the Texas Rangers for two minor league pitchers. 
 
Mazzilli cried when he heard the news. To say he was bitter about the trade would be an understatement. 
 
> “I hope this is the worst deal the Mets ever made. I don’t want this to sound derogatory, but the Mets have made some bad deals in the past. I want this one to be the worst.” -- Lee Mazzilli 
 
In fact, Associated Press sportswriter Joe Stroop called the deal ""one of the worst trades in the team’s history"" -- but the team he was talking about was the Texas Rangers. The two minor league pitchers the Rangers gave up were Ron Darling, who earned 16.0 bWAR in nine seasons with the Mets, and Walt Terrell, worth 4.0 bWAR in three seasons with the Mets, and then traded for Howard Johnson! 
 
Mazzilli went to Texas thinking he would be the starting center fielder since the previous year's starter -- former Yankee Mickey Rivers -- had injured his knee. Instead, the same situation played out in Texas as it had happened in New York. The Rangers had an exciting young rookie for center field, George Wright, and Mazzilli was pushed to left. Maz was more outspoken this time: 
 
> ""Left field is an idiot's position. It's for catchers and guys who can't play defense. I've even seen teams put pitchers out there."" 
 
Rangers manager Don Zimmer -- Torre's future bench coach -- then moved Mazzilli from left field to designated hitter, which Mazzilli found even worse: ""Being the DH is like playing half a game."" 
 
He didn't like it off the field, either. ""The people in Texas have all been nice, but it's not New York. It's not the same,"" he groused to a New York reporter. ""And I ain't wearing no cowboy hat."" 
 
Then, in May, Mazzilli tore ligaments in his wrist, and went on the Disabled List for the first time in his career. When he returned at the end of June, circumstances had changed dramatically: Wright was hitting just .239/.275/.376 and had made five errors in center field, and Mick the Quick -- who had been expected to miss just the first six weeks of the season -- re-injured himself in his first plate appearance and would miss another two months. Zimmer put Wright in right, and Mazzilli in center. 
 
But Mazzilli didn't fare any better, hitting just .220/.317/.319 in 104 plate appearances after returning from the Disabled List, and had a shoulder injury. Zimmer went back to Wright in center, with Mazzilli at DH. When Rivers came back in July, the Rangers put him at DH, and Mazzilli to the bench. 
 
What the Rangers really needed was a shortstop, having tried Mark Wagner, Wayne Tolleson, Doug Flynn, and Mario Mendoza -- he of the famed Mendoza Line -- at the position. 
 
Meanwhile, in New York, the Yankees had a disgruntled fan favorite of their own. Bucky Dent, the starting shortstop since 1977, a player with three All-Star selections, two World Series rings, and [one very big home run](https://youtu.be/0tl7xW4Oxo0?si=RMORdp2QP5AxdyBp), was as unhappy in the Bronx as Mazzilli was in Texas. 
 
On April 10, the Yankees had traded reliever Ron Davis and prospects Greg Gagne and Paul Boris to Minnesota for Roy Smalley Jr., a veteran shortstop who was a year younger than Dent. At first the pair platooned at short, then Smalley played third base after Graig Nettles missed three weeks with an injured thumb. But when Nettles came back, Smalley moved to short, and Dent -- hitting .169 -- went to the bench. 
 
The Yankees wanted to turn their surplus shortstop not into a center fielder -- the underrated Jerry Mumphrey was having an outstanding year -- but a first baseman. 
 
New York started the year with a platoon of 36-year-old first baseman Bob Watson -- their future GM -- and 29-year-old Dave Revering, but traded Watson (hitting .235) to Atlanta on April 23 and Revering (hitting .150) to Toronto on May 5. 
 
Mayberry, acquired for Revering, had hit .273/.405/.455 for the Blue Jays and the Yankees thought they'd found their answer. But Mayberry hit just .133 during his first week in pinstripes, and that kicked off a game of musical chairs with the Yankees trying Butch Hobson, Dave Collins, and Steve ""Bye Bye"" Balboni, along with Mayberry. None seized the opportunity. Why not Mazzilli? 
 
And so on August 8, with the Rangers in town to play the Yankees, the two teams swapped unhappy players -- Mazzilli for Dent. The Rangers had wanted to make the deal prior to that day's doubleheader, but Steinbrenner -- knowing the fans would be upset about trading away Dent -- insisted it not be made until after the games were over, as the Yankees were to embark on a one-week road trip. When Dent wasn't on the lineup card for either game, chants of ""We want Bucky!"" broke out at the Stadium, but he remained on the bench. 
 
Both players were reportedly happy with the deal. 
 
""I've really enjoyed playing for the Yankees, but I wasn't in their future plans and being traded to a team that wants me as an everyday player is the best thing that could have happened to me,"" Dent said. 
 
""I never wanted to leave New York in the first place,"" Mazzilli said. ""I feel like God tapped me on the shoulder and gave me another chance."" 
 
Mazzilli hit a respectable .266/.347/.422 (113 OPS+) in 144 plate appearances, but that off-season the Yankees signed free agents Don Baylor and Steve Kemp. Baylor was to be the full-time designated hitter, and Kemp an outfielder, pushing Ken Griffey Jr.'s dad to first base. With Mumphrey and Dave Winfield the other outfielders, there was no room for Mazzilli. The Yankees traded him to the Pirates for four minor league pitchers; of the four, the only one who reached the majors was Tim Burke, and he did it with the Expos. (He returned to the Yankees to close out his career in 1992.) 
 
Mazzilli had three and a half decent years with the Pirates, hitting .244/.369/.337 (98 OPS+) in 881 plate appearances. Released by the Pirates on July 23, 1986, he signed with the Mets a week later. In the World Series, he went 2-for-5 with two runs scored in the win over the Red Sox. He played with the Mets until 1989, when they waived him on July 31; the Blue Jays claimed him, and he had a nice little last hurrah, hitting .227 but with a .395 OBP and .455 SLG in 86 plate appearances, and played for the Blue Jays in the post-season that year. 
 
After his playing days were over, Mazzilli became an actor, a broadcaster, and even opened a sports bar. In 1995, he served as commissioner of the independent Northeast League. 
 
In 1997, at the request of his old pal Joe Torre, Mazzilli reunited with the Yankees to become manager of the Tampa Yankees, then the Norwich Navigators. From 2000 to 2003, he served as Torre's first-base coach, winning a World Series ring in 2000. 
 
In 2004, Mazzilli became manager of the Baltimore Orioles. He said within a half-hour of getting hired, he was on the phone with his fellow Italian-American from Brooklyn. 
 
> ""I just said, 'Well, big brother, I got the job.'"" 
 
""I couldn't be happier for him,"" Torre told reporters. ""He certainly has gained valuable experience over the years and I have a great deal of confidence that he'll do a fine job with the Orioles."" The Orioles went 78-84 in their first year under Mazzilli, then started the second year 51-56 and he was fired. (The team went 23-32 the rest of the way under manager Sam Perlozzo, who began his minor league career with the Fort Lauderdale Yankees in 1973!) 
 
Mazzilli returned to the Yankees in 2006 as Torre's bench coach, then worked in the Yankees front office and as a guest hitting instructor in spring training.

* Mazzilli's nickname, Maz, has only one Z, but his last name has two. [Writing his last name would have given Billy Madison just as much trouble as ""Rizzuto""](https://youtu.be/wAsxQH0iJRw?si=80kDW4K8nZZe5yT3). His other nickname, which he shared with Rocky Balboa, was ""the Italian Stallion."" 
 
* Indeed, reporters often compared Mazzilli's Italian-American good looks to Sylvester Stallone, as well as to John Travolta. Famous for his sleek physique, charming smile, and [tight pants](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a7/18/46/a718460540ef1a2c8d02972062502da4.jpg), a 1979 article in *Sports Illustrated* painted the picture: ""From behind the 10-foot chain link fence that encloses the players' parking lot, a cry came forth: 'Lee! It's Lee! Oh, Lee!' Mazzilli seemed flustered and walked shyly past his Cadillac Coupe de Ville toward a throng of girls. They thrust pens through the fence and twittered. Mazzilli is olive-skinned, dark-eyed, high-cheekboned -- very Kiss-Me-I'm-Italian."" 
 
* Three years later, he still had it when *The Sporting News* called him ""the darling of female fans at Shea Stadium."" 
 
* Bucky Dent was just as much of a heartthrob for the Yankees as Lee Mazzilli was for the Mets. “By trading Bucky Dent for Lee Mazzilli, what George Steinbrenner accomplished was to swap one handsome, matinee idol of 14-year-olds for another,” wrote Phil Pepe of the *New York Daily News*. “On the meter of sex symbols, the trade was a push.” 
 
* It was kind of a push on the field as well. Mazzilli was OK for the Yankees in half a season, then was traded for four minor league pitchers; Dent hit .219 in Texas, and the following year hit .237. The Rangers released him after spring training in 1984, and Bucky signed a minor league deal to return to the Yankees. He went 15-for-60 in Triple-A and was released. The Royals signed him as a back-up for the final month of the 1984 season, and he went 3-for-9, then retired. He returned to the Yankees the following season as a minor league manager, then became the Yankees manager from 1989-1990. 
 
* Mazzilli's matinee idol looks earned him TV and movie offers even when he was still playing baseball, including a part in *Raging Bull*, but he turned them down in order to focus on his game. After baseball, he had a bit part in 1991's [Dead or Alive: The Race for Gus Farace](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101677/). Based on a true story, Gus Farace was a mobster who was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List for the murder of a DEA agent; the Mafia wanted to find and kill him first to prevent him from talking. The Farace case also was (loosely) the inspiration for the Steven Seagal movie *Out for Justice.*) *Dead or Alive* was a made-for-TV movie, but what a cast: Tony Danza, Samuel L. Jackson, Ted Levine, Frank Vincent, and Dan Lauria, the dad from *The Wonder Years.* 
 
* Mazzilli also starred as Tony in an off-Broadway production of *Tony n' Tina's Wedding*, and was a guest star on the TV series *Big Brother Jake.* And this summer, Mazzilli will appear as ""Coach Valentine"" in the movie [American Summer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6523546/), starring Steve Guttenberg, Christie Brinkley, and... Dan Lauria, the dad from *The Wonder Years*. (Mazzilli credited Lauria with helping him get his acting career off the ground.) 
 
* He also did some broadcasting for CBS Radio and SNY, and co-hosted *Sports Extra* with Bill Mazer on Channel 5! 
 
* Walt Terrell, the other pitcher the Mets got for Mazzilli along with Ron Darling, was later traded two years later to the Tigers for Howard Johnson. Four years later, the Tigers traded him to the Padres. Later that season, the Padres traded Terrell, an impending free agent, to... the Yankees, for fan favorite Mike Pagliarulo. (Terrell went 6-5 with a 5.20 ERA (75 ERA+) in half a season, then signed with the Pirates.) The trade of Pags turned third base into a revolving door at Yankee Stadium until we acquired Charlie Hayes in 1992... only to lose him to the Colorado Rockies in the expansion draft. So we signed Wade Boggs. 
 
* Maz could throw equally well with either hand; so could Don Mattingly. In fact, after becoming a manager and coach, Mattingly occasionally threw with his right hand to rest his left arm! 
 
* In 1979, Mazzilli was chasing a fly ball hit by Davey Lopes when he was leveled in a collision with solidly-built outfielder [Dan Norman](https://kids.kiddle.co/images/5/5c/Dan_Norman_Mets.jpg). Lopes, who scored an inside-the-park home run on the play, said it looked like ""a big train hitting a small train."" Mazzilli was hospitalized that night for observation and missed three games. 
 
* Named an All-Star for the only time in 1979, Mazzilli hit a pinch-hit home run to tie the game at 6-6 in the top of the eighth inning. The ball just cleared the left-field wall at the Seattle Kingdome, or did it? Jayson Stark, then a sportswriter with the *Philadelphia Inquirer*, called it a 315-footer hit on a 316-foot-long-field, claiming a fan had reached over the wall to grab it. (It wasn't Jeffrey Maier, who wouldn't be born for another five years.) In the top of the ninth, Mazzilli drew a bases loaded walk off none other than Ron Guidry to give the National League the 7-6 lead and the eventual win. Despite Mazzilli being responsible for the game-tying and go-ahead RBIs, the MVP went to Dave Parker, who went 1-for-3 with a walk, an RBI, and two baserunner kills. 
 
* In addition to Guidry, the defending two-time World Series champion Yankees were represented by Tommy John, Graig Nettles, and Reggie Jackson. Future Yankees Dave Winfield, Gaylord Perry, Joe Niekro, and Jack Clark joined Mazzilli on the N.L. team. 
 
* In 1975, Mazzilli set a California League record -- and maybe a record for all of professional baseball -- when he stole seven bases in one game. 
 
* As a guest hitting instructor with the Yankees in spring training in 2019, Mazzilli was briefly hospitalized after getting hit in the head by a ball during batting practice. 
 
* Mazzilli graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn, which also produced sportscaster Marv Albert; singers Neil Diamond and Neil Sedaka; actors John Forsythe, Louis Gossett Jr., and Harvey Keitel; authors Joseph Heller and Arthur Miller; All-Star point guard Stephon Marbury; drummer Buddy Rich; and Eddie ""Crazy Eddie"" Antar. 
 
* Mazzilli's son, L.J. Mazzilli, was drafted by the Mets and eventually traded to the Yankees, just like his dad. Mazzilli played six years in the minors, including parts of four seasons in Triple-A in which he hit .239/.310/.391 in 335 at-bats, and then three more in the independent Atlantic League before hanging it up at age 32 in 2022. 
 
* Mazzilli wore \#24 during his playing days with the Yankees, a number he never wore with another team. With the Mets he was \#12, \#16, and \#13; \#16 with the Rangers; \#11 and \#16 with the Pirates; and \#13 with the Blue Jays. \#11 and \#13 were available when he was with the Yankees, but not \#12, which was being worn by John Mayberry,  or \#16, retired for Whitey Ford in 1974.

Hoo boy, starting a small business isn't a walk in the park, that's for sure! We had a couple stumbles upon the way, especially when we were still a two-person team, but the reception has been wonderful and we are so happy to be here in Malden.



As our team has grown, so too has our menu and what we're able to provide! We now offer a variety of hot and iced teas, both caffeinated and herbal, a consistent cold brew roster, and iced coffee! Lionheart pastries are a mainstay at this point, and you can expect to see their donuts, scones, muffins and cookies in our pastry case most days of the week.



Our first few events have been a rousing success; we've had an open mic, a concert, a book swap, and even a drag show in tandem with Idle hands. We're looking to throw more in the near future, so watch this space!  
Moreover, we have plenty of space on offer, so if you want to throw an event we'd love to host you! You can reach out to us here, on our instagram, or to [cafe.reynard.events@gmail.com](mailto:cafe.reynard.events@gmail.com)



We're listening to what you want. Steamed milk drinks, especially cafe mistos and tea lattes, are being tested right now- if you come in on one of our slow days I'll make you one, and you can expect to see them on the menu soon. Nailing down a consistent food menu is next. Our pastries are great, but we hope to also offer breakfast sandwiches in the future.



We hear you- we need to expand our hours. As soon as we're able to expand out team, we're gonna hire someone who can open earlier so we can be open at 6:30 or so to better serve the commuter crowd!

  
Thank you so much for welcoming us into Malden's community like this- we're truly lucky to be able to do what we love for a living, and if you haven't come by yet, we can't wait to meet you!",17,1747316705.0,malden,4,1.0,False

We ended up talking for nearly 45 minutes in the store aisle like exchanging tips and techniques. Turns out Mike had been detailing cars as a serious hobby for years while I'd learned everything from my dad who was obsessive about car care. Before leaving, we exchanged numbers to meet up.  
Over the next two weeks, we hung out a few times, first at a local cars and coffee event, then detailing each other's cars just for fun. One evening while grabbing beers, Mike suggested we should start a detailing business together. I laughed it off initially but then I saw that he was very serious about it so we decided to go with it.

His idea was to go door to door and just ask ppl if they want to have their cards detailed. I was incredibly nervous knocking on doors but to our surprise we booked our first client right away. They referred us to a neighbor, who referred us to someone else and within two weeks we had completed 5 full details and have 3 more scheduled.

Not sure if this is the right place to post, but I could really use some advice. I accidentally spilled coffee all over my 2024 15-inch MacBook Air. After drying it out for a few days (upside down) and cleaning it as best as I could with isopropyl alcohol, it still seems to be working fine overall.

I took it to the AMAC store (I'm in the Netherlands), and they told me the repair would cost more than the laptop is worth. That really surprised me — the technician even advised against repairing it and just suggested buying a new one.

The main issues are that the spacebar is partially stuck and unresponsive on one side, and the trackpad has slightly weaker haptic feedback than usual.

Does anyone have any other advice or experience with this? Would going to an actual Apple Store give me a different outcome?

We’d been exchanging glances for months, but only really spoke at our college picnic when we swapped photos.

We’d talked about meeting for coffee (date not yet scheduled) and had even joked about kissing. We were totally flirting with each other.

This morning she messaged to say she was going out with her family (including her elder brothers) to visit a temple and would ping me later this evening. I thought nothing of it… until I discovered she’d blocked me on Instagram and Snapchat and unfriended me everywhere else. I’ve spent the whole day feeling blindsided, embarrassed, and depressed.

1kn8ji8,https://www.reddit.com/r/thesidehustle/comments/1kn8ji8/from_0_to_passive_income_in_a_weird_niche_youve/,From $0 to Passive Income in a Weird Niche You’ve Probably Never Considered,"I wanted to share my journey into one of the strangest — yet surprisingly profitable — digital side hustles I’ve ever stumbled into: Custom AI-generated Adult Audio.

Before I dive into the meat of it, let me give you some context…

About a year ago, I was stuck in a rut juggling freelance gigs, burnt out from client work, and constantly broke. I was living off coffee, ramen, and Reddit rabbit holes, desperately looking for a way to build something scalable without a huge upfront investment.

I’d always been curious about AI. One night, while messing around with ElevenLabs and some open-source TTS models, I had a stupid idea: “What if I could clone a voice and script some spicy audio content for fun?”

It was half a joke — until I realized there’s a whole underground economy of people paying real money for personalized NSFW audio.

So I went full goblin mode on research.


Step 1: Researching the NSFW Audio Market

First, I spent a week just lurking and listening:
	
•	Subreddits like r/GoneWildAudio, r/NSFWAudio, r/EroticaGuild
	
•	Fan platforms like Fansly and Patreon
	
•	Gumroad stores of audio creators
	
•	Even Discord servers dedicated to audio roleplay

I noticed three huge things:
	
1.	Personalization sells — People love content that feels custom-made for them.
	
2.	Women dominate the space, but there’s growing demand for male/femboy/androgynous voices too.
	
3.	Most creators record everything manually — AI could cut production time by 80%.

That was my lightbulb moment.


Step 2: Picking the Right Tools

I tested at least 10 different TTS tools and voice AI platforms. Here’s what I landed on:
	
•	ElevenLabs: Hands-down the best for natural-sounding voices. I cloned 2 voices (one sultry, one soft dom) using 5-minute clean voice samples.
	
•	TTS alternatives: XTTS from Coqui, Bark (okay quality), and OpenVoice (more customizable).
	
•	Scriptwriting: GPT-4 (yep, this bad boy). I built a prompt library for different kinks, accents, character types, etc.
	
•	Editing: Audacity + free plugins (reverb, EQ, background ambience).
	
•	Automation: Python scripts to batch-generate audios + Canva templates for cover art.


The first 20 audios were clunky. Mispronunciations, pacing issues, audio artifacts… But I iterated. Fast.


Step 3: Building the Production & Delivery System

Once I had a system down, I structured everything like a mini production studio:
	
•	Google Sheets to track requests, delivery dates, tags/kinks, and customer preferences.
	
•	Notion database of scripts, prompt templates, and voice notes.
	
•	Gumroad as the storefront for pre-made audios + private delivery of customs.
	
•	Telegram bot for quick customer communication + sending download links.
	
•	Zapier to connect purchase > audio delivery > email collection.

It sounds complicated but once it was built, I could take a custom request at 2 AM and have it auto-fulfilled in 15 mins with minimal touch.


Step 4: Finding Clients and Making Sales

This was the trickiest part. Here’s what worked (and what didn’t):

What didn’t work:
	
•	Running ads (platforms block NSFW content fast)
	
•	Posting in big subs (usually against rules)
	
•	Cold DMs (don’t be that person)

What actually worked:
	
•	Posting samples on alt Reddit accounts with links to my Gumroad
	
•	Offering “Pay what you want” customs early on to build testimonials
	
•	Creating “niche packs” like F4M vampire audio series, femboy cuddles, or JOI scripts
	
•	Partnering with NSFW writers to turn their stories into audio collabs
	
•	Building a tiny email list of repeat buyers with a “What kink should I do next?” poll

Within 2 months I had my first $100 week. Then $400. Then a $900 month with less than 10 hours of work.


Turning It Passive (While I Sleep, Literally)

The game-changer was batch-creating content packs:
	
•	“10 F4M audios for submissive guys”
	
•	“7-day girlfriend experience audio journey”
	
•	“Cursed AI audio with glitchy horror erotica”

These sold over and over again on Gumroad and Fanhouse.

Then I set up a mini Patreon clone with a monthly drop of new customs, access to voting polls, and behind-the-scenes prompts. 10 loyal subs at $10/month?


Obstacles, Fails & Lessons
	
•	Voice cloning isn’t perfect: You need clean data. Don’t clone without consent.
	
•	NSFW content toes legal/ethical lines: Avoid real people’s voices or anything remotely illegal.
	
•	AI can’t fully replace real emotion: But you can mask that with sound effects, music, and smart pacing.
	
•	Trust is huge: Use alt accounts but stay consistent. Be respectful. Don’t ghost clients.


TL;DR: What Worked
	
•	Solving for scale: AI lets you do what others can’t — fast, custom, repeatable.
	
•	Being niche AF: Don’t try to please everyone. Pick a kink or character type and go deep.
	
•	Creating systems: Front-load the work so it becomes passive.
	
•	Staying anonymous but human: Use a persona, build a brand, and offer insane value.

It’s weird. It’s niche. But damn, it works.

I like to fill his awake time with lots of engagement and activities. The other day my partner suggested that I let him chill more solo because long term it'll come back to bite me, saying he may turn into an ""iPad kid"" that constantly needs to be entertained if I continue this route.

I can see the point but it's hard to leave him alone since he's still so little and such a potato, not rolling or sitting up without support. I let him play on his gym mat and on his bouncer for short periods by himself to make food, coffee, brush teeth, etc. Otherwise I am playing with him and/or beside him the whole day (exhausting lol!). 

Do y'all let your baby just chill (obviously supervised)? A part of me feels bad to do that but perhaps it's just first time mom guilt. I feel this constant pressure on myself to develop him and make sure all milestones are being met and that to me means engagement. I'm on mat leave for a year while hubby works so unless someone's visiting or we go see grandma it's just us two. It's always less pressure with others around who can hold and play with the baby.

The allure of coastal living can transform any home into a serene sanctuary. Imagine a space that reflects the tranquility of the ocean, infuses fresh air with a hint of salt, and invites the soothing sounds of waves crashing against the shore. The coastal decor style is not only visually appealing but also promotes a relaxed lifestyle that many seek to achieve. In this article, we’ll explore 15 inspiring coastal living room ideas that will help you create a breezy, beachy atmosphere in your home.

  
1. Light and Airy Color Palette

  
A successful coastal living room begins with the right color palette. Soft whites, sandy beiges, ocean blues, and seafoam greens evoke the colors of the beach.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Paint the walls in a soft, airy white

  
or light blue.

  
Use natural fabrics

  
such as linen or cotton that allow for light flow.

  
Incorporate pastel accents

  
with cushions and rugs to add dimension without overwhelming the senses.

  
2. Natural Textures

  
Textures play a key role in creating a coastal ambiance. Incorporating natural elements into your decor enhances the connection to the beach.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Use rattan or wicker furniture

  
for a comfortable yet chic aesthetic.

  
Add jute or sisal rugs

  
for a natural, earthy touch.

  
Decorate with driftwood sculptures

  
or accessories for added texture that sparks conversation.

  
3. Ocean-Inspired Artwork

  
Artwork is an excellent way to reinforce your coastal theme. Choose pieces that reflect the beauty of the shoreline.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Hang large canvas prints of ocean landscapes

  
or serene beach scenes.

  
Incorporate nautical motifs

  
, such as shells or boats, into your wall decor.

  
Create a gallery wall

  
with a collection of coastal art pieces for visual interest.

  
4. Sea Glass Accents

  
Sea glass adds a unique character, reminiscent of the beach. Its translucent beauty can be incorporated in various decor pieces.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Use sea glass vases

  
or candle holders as centerpieces.

  
Incorporate sea glass colors

  
into smaller decorative accents like picture frames.

  
Create a DIY project

  
like sea glass wall hangings for a personal touch.

  
5. Open Spaces with Natural Light

  
Bright, open spaces are a hallmark of the coastal aesthetic. Maximizing natural light will make your living room feel more inviting.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Opt for large, unobstructed windows

  
that allow sunlight to pour in.

  
Use sheer curtains

  
to maintain privacy while letting in light.

  
Arrange furniture

  
to face windows, fostering a connection with the outdoors.

  
6. Nautical Lighting Fixtures

  
Lighting is crucial in setting the mood of your coastal living room. Nautical-style fixtures can enhance your decor while offering functionality.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Install pendant lights or chandeliers

  
that mimic marine elements, such as lanterns or shells.

  
Use floor lamps with rope accents

  
for a rustic touch.

  
Incorporate dimmer switches

  
to adjust ambiance from bright and airy to cozy and intimate.

  
7. Coastal-themed Fabrics

  
Fabrics with coastal motifs can add character and warmth to your living area. Choose textiles that reflect the beach’s tranquility.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Use throw pillows and blankets

  
featuring marine life or anchor patterns.

  
Incorporate printed curtains

  
with subtle wave designs.

  
Choose upholstery fabrics

  
that are durable and easy to clean, as they will be comfortable for relaxing.

  
8. Indoor Plants and Greenery

  
Bringing nature indoors is essential for a coastal vibe. Indoor plants breathe life into your space, mimicking the lush environment of coastal areas.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Select low-maintenance plants

  
such as succulents, ferns, or palm varieties.

  
Use decorative planters

  
that complement your coastal theme.

  
Arrange plants at various heights

  
for visual interest, placing some on shelves or pedestals.

How to Achieve the Look:

  
Choose deep-seated sofas

  
with soft cushions in light colors.

that encourage relaxation.

  
Use multi-functional furniture

Accessories are the finishing touch that can elevate your coastal living room. Choose decor that embodies the spirit of the seaside.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Incorporate beachcomber finds

  
—think seashells, starfish, and coral.

  
Use coastal-inspired books

  
to decorate your coffee table, featuring beach photography or coastal living tips.

  
Create a curated display

  
of beach finds in glass jars or shadow boxes.

  
11. Outdoor Connections

  
Blur the lines between your indoor and outdoor spaces to foster a natural flow in your coastal living area.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Use large glass doors that open to a patio or deck

  
, enhancing the sense of space.

  
Place outdoor-style furniture indoors

  
to reinforce the beachy feel.

  
Create a sunroom

  
where you can enjoy the outdoors while being sheltered.

  
12. Layered Lighting

  
Using different light sources at varying heights creates a warm, inviting ambiance. Layered lighting mimics the soft glow of the beach sunset.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Combine overhead lights

  
with table lamps and wall sconces.

  
Use candles or fairy lights

  
for a soft, magical lighting option during evenings.

  
Isolate areas

  
with focused lighting to create cozy nooks throughout the space.

  
13. Cozy Throw Blankets

  
Nothing says relaxation like a cozy blanket. Adding throw blankets can enhance comfort while keeping the space visually appealing.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Drape a soft, textured blanket

  
over your couch or armchair.

  
Opt for colors that align

  
with your coastal palette, such as aqua or sandy hues.

  
Use a variety of textures

  
to invite tactile exploration.

  
14. Incorporating a Fireplace

  
If your living room includes a fireplace, design it to exude a coastal vibe. A fireplace can serve as a beautiful focal point of the room.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Surround the fireplace with beach stones

  
or whitewashed wood.

  
Add nautical decor,

  
like a ship wheel or a beach painting above it.

  
Use a simple, elegant mantel

  
that could hold seaside-themed decor.

  
15. Personal Coastal Touches

  
Finally, adding personal touches can truly make your coastal living room unique. Incorporate items and memories that resonate with your coastal experiences.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Display souvenirs from beach trips

  
, such as photos and keepsakes.

  
Include books or travel memorabilia

  
that highlight your love of the coast.

By using a light color palette, natural textures, and elements that echo the beach, you can design a space that fosters relaxation and joy. Remember, the goal is to create a sanctuary that not only reflects the beauty of coastal living but is also functional, comfortable, and uniquely you. Let your imagination sail, and inspire your coastal dreams with these 15 ideas for a breathtaking living room retreat.

I’m in the final stretch of my exam preparation and have a few quick questions for those who passed—especially if you did the exam online.

1. I read that speaking or mumbling the questions out loud is prohibited. But is it okay if I just move my lips silently or cover my mouth with my hand while reading?
2. When doing mock exams, I found it helpful to highlight the question text with my cursor (not with a marker—just dragging the blue selection). Is this possible in the actual exam interface? It really helps me process the question better, since English isn’t my first language. 😊
3. Can anyone explain how breaks work during the online exam? SH didn't support breaks in the mock exams, so I want to be prepared. I live in a studio apartment, so technically the camera is always in my kitchen. Can I have a coffee or snack during the break, or are there restrictions?
4. My SH percentile is 78%, with 86% on practice questions (second attempt) and 73% on exam questions. I’ve done two mock exams:
   * Mock 1: 76% (84% without expert-level questions)
   * Mock 2: 77% (88% without expert-level questions)

Based on what I’ve seen in this sub, I *should* be ready to pass. But would you still recommend completing all five mock exams, given that I still have time and haven’t scheduled the test yet?

1kn8b0v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kn8b0v,Lane Perception Plateau Coffee Table - What's the deal?,"I picked up this Lane Perception Plateau coffee table off of Marketplace. It's a big 'un at 52"" long and 32"" wide. The single long drawer with the woven wood detail slides out from either side. Structurally good, but the top has a bunch of small dings and scratches that seem to go through the finish and not into the veneer. Serial number is a little obscured, but I think it was made in 1965.

I can't find much online about the Plateau tables. Did they not make many?

I'm wondering if this looks like it has the original finish? I know these didn't have the same contrast look as the Acclaim line. 

I'm not a reseller and just wanted this table for my home. I'm thinking it'd be nice to restore the top at some point. I saw the Mad Man Restorations video about redoing an Acclaim table, but not sure I'm up to the task of DIYing this. I'd probably try to find someone locally who knows what they're doing.

Don’t be in your own head while you’re doing it—humans pick up on that instantly. I had a bit of charm, nothing crazy, just enough to small talk comfortably. But every time I tried to escalate—like asking someone to coffee—I’d already rehearsed it in my head, building it up. The whole convo would have that background noise playing, and even if she said yes, it would feel so forced that the energy died before it even started.

*My solution?*

I’m Aussie and I love cricket. I remembered Steve Smith saying he stays present and out of his head by following little routines—before the game, between deliveries. Nadal does it too in tennis. So I stole the idea and gamified my own problem.

*Level 1: Low-Stress Practice*

> I picked something chill—ordering coffee. My goal? Be present and use my five senses. My routine: tap each elbow, then each knee, then click each hand 3 times—left then right. Afterwards, I let myself feel proud. I’d imagine how a batter feels after scoring. Then I’d order the coffee, focusing just on eye contact and a smile. That’s it.

*Level 2: Slightly More Stress*

> Next I tried the routine before talking to my boss. Same pattern: routine, presence, pride,then into the interaction. Focused on eye contact, smiling, and confidence.

*Level 3: Destroy the Voice* 

> I thought of this as upping the difficulty to hard, I cold approached girls I thought were cute but *THE KEY* was *no approach to date*, this level was all about deleting that anxious voice with my rehearsed coffee line I’d have whenever cold approaching. So again routine, pride, confidence, eye contact, smile and this time I added a new one, compliment. I did this level over and over and over until it felt natural

*Level 4: Putting It All Together*

> By this stage, asking someone to coffee just felt natural. And when you feel comfortable, the other person feels safe. That’s what makes it land.

Students across all grades are obsessed with energy drinks. They’ll brag about having 3 Celsius drinks a day (600 mg of caffeine, 1.5x the FDA’s recommended limit for ADULTS). We do not sell them onsite but students bring them from home.

I’m really concerned about the safety of these drinks, especially given the volume. Aside from obvious issues with sleep and anxiety, these drinks could cause serious heart problems. For a few weeks, our admin told us to tell students to throw them away if we saw them. It caused an uproar and parents defended the energy drinks, saying if they give their child something, the child should be allowed to drink it. 

Is anyone else experiencing this? I previously worked at a college and most students just drank a ton of coffee, not several energy drinks. 

I’ve brought it up with colleagues and they all say “well, they just have so much homework” “well, they’re just such hardworking students” and whatnot… My perspective: if such hardworking students need to risk heart problems to finish their work, maybe we need to reconsider how much work we assign OR we need to teach better time management and study skills.

I just went out to drink and snacked a little in between. I cook better than most restaurants, so this is good for my waistline and wallet. I don't have much of a social life, which is fine, I guess. There were a few days when I I wanted to drink bad, but I didn't. I think life is better without alcohol, but I would still be drinking if it didn't make me feel so awful. I'm in my 50s, so at this point, drinking = early death. I just enjoy life without being tethered to drinking.

1kn83xk,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1kn83xk/micromanaging_coworkers/,Micromanaging coworkers.,"Like what is their deal? And often they are the slackers, the ones that make the most mistakes, the laziest, worst performers. At least, in my case. 

My micromanaging coworker often refuses to call customers back she doesn’t feel like talking to, but she expects me to call customers back the split damn second she tells me. 

She makes constant mistakes, and it’s never her fault. But boy you better not let her catch one of your mistakes. You’ll be humiliated in front of everyone. 

She listens to conversations I’m having with customers and interjects. She’s “helping” when I did not ask for, nor need, her help.

If our boss sends us individual emails/texts asking for our individual commission bonuses. “Did you get (boss’s name) text/email?” Yes. I’m a big girl. I know how to check my emails and texts. I don’t need you asking me every damn week if I got our boss’s messages. 

Our boss lets us use the first 30 minutes of work how we choose. We open at 9am but get in at 8:30am. That’s our time to log in, make coffee, etc. Coworker immediately gets on her desktop and starts working. That’s fine for her. But she’ll start asking me questions about customers before I’m even logged in. And I better not make her wait for me to get logged in. Too bad. First is coffee. Always. Then we’ll discuss work. 

In fact, she’s like this with anything she asks me to do. Has to be done immediately. Not on my watch it doesn’t. If she needs me to do something for her, and I’m in the middle of my own tasks, her requests *will* wait. 

Again this is someone who’s so damn lazy she can’t even get her ass out of her seat to get something she needs. She too often will ask me and my other coworker to grab things in the office and bring them to her. “Can you bring me the cash box?” Get it your damn self. You have two legs. You can walk. Someone who will piss customers off for not calling back. She leaves work early, when she’s not supposed to. And on and on. 

In fact, she gets antsy if she can’t find something to tell me to do. She’ll start pulling shit out of thin air. It’s like she can’t relax if she’s not bossing someone around. ",3,1747315412.0,coworkerstories,5,1.0,False

Don’t be in your own head while you’re doing it—humans pick up on that instantly. I had a bit of charm, nothing crazy, just enough to small talk comfortably. But every time I tried to escalate—like asking someone to coffee—I’d already rehearsed it in my head, building it up. The whole convo would have that background noise playing, and even if she said yes, it would feel so forced that the energy died before it even started.

*My solution?*

I’m Aussie and I love cricket. I remembered Steve Smith saying he stays present by following little routines—before the game, between deliveries. Nadal does it too in tennis. So I stole the idea and gamified my own problem.

*Level 1: Low-Stress Practice*

> I picked something chill—ordering coffee. My goal? Be present and use my five senses. My routine: tap each elbow, then each knee, then click each hand 3 times—left then right. Afterwards, I let myself feel proud. I’d imagine how a batter feels after scoring. Then I’d order the coffee, focusing just on eye contact and a smile. That’s it.

*Level 2: Slightly More Stress*

> Next I tried the routine before talking to my boss. Same pattern: presence, pride, then into the interaction. Focused on eye contact, smiling, and confidence.

*Level 3: Destroy the Voice* 

> I thought of this as upping the difficulty to hard, I cold approached girls I thought were cute but *THE KEY* was *no approach to date*, this level was all about deleting that anxious voice with my rehearsed coffee line I’d have whenever cold approaching. So again routine, pride, confidence, eye contact, smile and this time I added a new one, compliment. I did this level over and over and over until it felt natural

*Level 4: Putting It All Together*

> By this stage, asking someone to coffee just felt natural. And when you feel comfortable, the other person feels safe. That’s what makes it land.

After we saw and killed the first one, we cleaned out EVERYTHING. We were already pretty clean, but our kitchen went into basically quarantine and everything was put in sealed containers even if it was already sealed. We pulled everything out of every cupboard and scrubbed it all. We pulled out the fridge and the dishwasher, and didn't find any around or inside the appliances. We saw probably 3-4 immature roaches isolated to the two cabinet nearest the sink. We put out glue traps and bait traps and an exterminator looked around and put out gel bait, and after that I think we saw two more live ones and a couple of dead ones, all also immature. The largest one we saw was 1/4 inch. A couple were in that same cabinet, and a couple were in or around the sink. We have a baby and have to get up at night to feed her, and all of our sightings have either been in the middle of the night or when we opened a cupboard first thing in the morning. 

We have also cleaned out our cupboards completely weekly in that time and haven't seen any roaches or signs of activity for about 2 months, alive or in regularly replaced glue traps. We dry out and plug the sink every night, leave absolutely nothing out, etc. We thought whatever it was was done, and started working on a move into the new house we just bought. Our apartment is not large, and our kitchen and dining area are one large space. Our dining area is basically the only place we can stack boxes we don't need to use since we both work from home and have a baby. We've had a stack of cardboard boxes going for probably two weeks, and a week ago we saw another immature roach in our sink, probably about 10 feet away from the boxes with a large island in between. I've never seen any outside of the kitchen, but I'm freaking out. We've left lights on in the dining area and built a moat of duct tape and glue traps around the boxes. We have now completely cleared out our cabinets, scrubbed down everything, and any kitchen items we packed in airtight plastic bins sealed with duct tape and haven't seen any others. We also aren't bringing any large appliances or furniture from the kitchen/dining and have opened up and inspected small appliances (coffee maker, grinder, blender, rice cooker, toaster). 

Do we need to get monthly service from an exterminator to prevent bringing an infestation to our new home? It feels easier to me to do it for a few months now for peace of mind if nothing else, and my husband is okay with this approach but thinks it's an overreaction.",1,1747315357.0,GermanRoaches,3,1.0,False
1kn82yk,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1kn82yk/does_aieve_appliance_slider_make_moving_small/,Does Aieve Appliance Slider Make Moving Small Kitchen Appliances Easier Review,"Testing the **Aieve 24 Pcs Small Appliance Slider** from day to day felt a bit like discovering a life hack that's been hiding under your nose. This product, built with Teflon material and featuring a self-adhesive installation system, redefined how appliances should be moved on kitchen countertops. Whether it’s for a stand mixer, an air fryer, or a coffee maker—this set brings practicality to the chaos of a busy kitchen environment.

**Design and Ease of Use**  
These small appliance sliders boast a minimal yet effective round shape and are designed to adhere seamlessly to most surfaces like tile, hardwood, and even marble. At first, I was a little skeptical about the self-adhesive backing. Could it really hold up against the weight of my rather hefty pressure cooker? After letting it sit for 14 hours post-installation, as recommended, the adhesive became impressively robust. The 7.13 x 4.84 x 0.39-inch dimensions are compact enough to stay hidden yet versatile enough to cater to a variety of appliance bases. Each piece elevates the height just enough to prevent the appliance's base from brushing against water spills—making these sliders a simple yet smart kitchen addition.  

[Want AIEVE 24 Pcs Small Appliance Slider? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0c88vmt83/)  

**Functionality and Performance**  
What struck me immediately was how smooth the gliding felt once the sliders were installed. Whether I pushed my air fryer back into its corner or pulled my coffee maker closer for morning brews, the process became effortless. Noise? None. Scratches? Not a single one on my marble countertop, both thanks to the Teflon construction. It even handles weighty appliances without compromise. For my air fryer, this was a relief since shifting it around used to feel like a chore. These casters made it feel as though the appliance was floating—magical and practical in one stroke.  

**Positives**  
A few notable benefits of these small appliance sliders are worth mentioning:  
- Their DIY installation allows you to customize and affix them to virtually any appliance.  
- They work exceptionally well as replacements for larger, clunky sliding trays or mats.  
- The PTFE material ensures frictionless movement across multiple surfaces, perfect for both wooden and tile countertops.  

**Areas of Concern**  
However, no product is flawless. I did encounter a couple of points that warrant improvement:  
- The adhesive requires a minimum wait time of 14 hours for best results, which feels like an eternity when you’re in a hurry to test it.  
- Once affixed, repositioning the sliders can be tricky and might compromise the adhesive strength.  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing these sliders to alternatives in the market, such as silicone mats or rubberized appliance coasters, I noticed distinct differences. Rubber coasters often grip too much, making movement awkward and straining. Silicone mats come with higher price tags but wear out faster. Unlike its competitors, the Aieve sliders excel with their unique Teflon composition, which maintains a balance of durability and ease of use. Trays and mats can take up additional counter space, while these sliders remain unobtrusive—a significant win for me!  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Talking about value, it’s clear that these sliders are well-positioned for budget-conscious buyers. The initial cost might seem marginally higher than basic alternatives, but the long-term utility makes up for it. Since they’re DIY adjustable and compatible with various appliances, you essentially get more flexibility for a comparable price point. For me, that’s smart spending with a touch of innovation.

1kn82f9,https://i.redd.it/jvllmjzg5y0f1.jpeg,Hi. I’m only 15 but i want to share my love story,"I met her when she was about to start 9th grade, and I was about to start 8th. All the girls at my school (and kids in general) seemed so boring, two-faced, dumb, and hypocritical. But she — she was different. I met her during one of the student council’s excursions. It wasn’t love at first sight (because I really hate that idea); I just thought, ""She’s interesting. I want to know more about her."" She was the best friend of one of my classmates, so it wasn’t hard to find her Instagram. I went from liking her stories and replying to them to sending her reels and talking about life. It was almost summer break when we started texting on Telegram all day long. It might seem weird to some people, but I even started saving cute photos and videos of her. At some point, I realized the love I felt wasn’t just friendship — it was something more.

I think it would be fair to mention that I’m not handsome or cool at all. I’m shorter than most of my classmates, and I definitely wouldn’t call myself attractive. Even so, I’m very smart, kind, I’ve been working out for more than a year, I don’t waste time on video games like most of my classmates, and overall, I have my good sides too. Still, I always thought I didn’t deserve her. That she was better. I thought she deserved more — but I still wanted her to be with me. Every time I saw her, my heart started beating faster, my tongue got tied, and I couldn’t say a word. Plus, I was very shy. I could text her for hours, but when I saw her at school, all I could manage was something like, ""Umm... hi. How’s it going?"" One of the reasons I still hate myself is that I did nothing to move our relationship to a new level. I stayed just a best friend. Nothing more.

I still blame myself for not inviting her on a single date, or even just out for a walk, during those two and a half years. After she graduated, I didn’t even see her during the summer break. And honestly, I think that was my fault. I thought about confessing to her so many times. I wanted to be her boyfriend. I wanted to walk with her, eat with her, study with her, listen to music together. But the fear of losing her even as a friend was stronger.

Time passed, and then she told me she was moving to another country soon. That news shocked me. I wanted to shout my feelings to her — but I didn’t. The only thing I’m proud of is that I finally invited her to a coffee date a week before she moved. Those were two hours of pure happiness. I didn’t talk much, but listening to her was enough. Just being able to sit close to her and look at her breathtakingly beautiful face made me happy. Then we met again the day before she left and talked about life. I still remember her words from that day: ""Let’s hug goodbye. Let’s make it a long one."" Her body was in my arms, and I could smell her lovely hair. As I said, I was shy — and that move from her made my heart beat like crazy.

It’s been two months since she moved to Spain, but something very important happened a month ago. On March 16th, I got a message: ""You know, I think I sympathize with you a little, but I’m not sure."" My heart almost stopped. I stared at the notification, not believing my eyes. I opened the chat. She was online.

""Are you for real right now? This isn’t some kind of joke, is it?"" She answered: ""No.""

I honestly couldn’t imagine her having any feelings for me. I told her everything — from the moment I fell in love to the moment she moved away. She said she wasn’t sure about her feelings, and she didn’t exactly have a crush on me. She even admitted that I wasn’t her type physically — but it was my charisma and personality that made her feel something. And that was enough. The fact that someone like her could find me even a little attractive made me smile and cry at the same time. I was so mad at myself. You can't even imagine how much I still blame myself for not making a single move. I imagined so many times us being together — but I never did a damn thing.

The moral of the story is simple: Never be afraid to confess your feelings or make a move. Even if you think you have no chance, you should still try.

1kn81om,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArlingtonMA/comments/1kn81om/what_i_said_at_town_meeting_last_night/,What I said at Town Meeting last night.,"At Town Meeting last night, I rose in support of Article 38.

Article 38 would allow some non-obnoxious business uses along the main roads in town. It's a small change, but could be helpful.

If you agree with me and want to support small businesses and the entrepreneurial spirit, **please email your town meeting members now, asking them to support local business** **and Article 38.**

This likely comes up for a vote on Monday night, May 19.

Here's what I said:

I run a business in the Heights – doing independent music distribution. And I can attest to the fact that there simply is not enough space in town for local businesses.

In 2003, when my company had outgrown our space in Somerville, we wanted to move to Arlington. But **we could not find an adequate space in town**. We ended up moving to Malden. We would not be able to move to the Heights for more than a decade.

My company is not alone in this experience. For almost four years, Arlington Brewing Company was unable to grow out of their basement. **For almost four years Arlington Brewing Company was unable to find a space for their business!**

Another business owner, who runs a coffee bean roasting company, told me that when he was trying to find space in town for his new business, he couldn’t find an open retail space. So he walked up and down Mass Ave and Broadway. He entered each of the stores there and asked the owners if they were planning on closing up shop. And that’s how he found a retail space.

And I know of another Arlington business owner has had problems with the lack of commercial space in town. She employs a dozen people now. She has outgrown her space and wants to expand. But there is nowhere in Arlington for her move her business. If she moved to Cambridge or Somerville, she would lose her customers. So she’s stuck and unable to grow.

Yet, when I recount these experiences, folks ask:

**WHAT ABOUT EMPTY STOREFRONTS?**

Compared to neighboring municipalities, **Arlington does not have many empty storefronts.**

Importantly, there **should** be available space for businesses to move into.

Still, there are a few empty storefronts. 

Here is why storefronts remain empty for any extended period of time:

1. 

According to the Chamber of Commerce and our Economic Development Coordinator, some store fronts remain vacant because they are too small. We have heard from a local commercial real estate professional that retail businesses are looking for at least 1000-1500 sf. Restaurants require 2000-2500 sf.

2. 

Businesses are looking for long-term leases to protect their build-out and relocation investments and cannot move into buildings that are slated for redevelopment.

3. 

Businesses are looking for reasonable terms. Remember, the landlords have the upper hand here because of a lack of commercial space in town.

Now, I don’t believe that this zoning change will solve the town’s problem of a lack of economic development – for that,

**Arlington needs an Economic Development Strategic Plan.**

Still. I support this change.

1kn7sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1kn7sex/scouring_noisy_feeds_for_great_content/,Scour.ing noisy feeds for great content,"Hi everyone,

A service I'm building has been mentioned a couple of times in this subreddit and it's now in a spot where I want to 'officially' tell you all about it. Feedback is very welcome!

[Scour](https://scour.ing) searches through noisy feeds for content matching your interests. You can sign up for free, add topics you're interested in (anything from ""RSS"" to ""Pourover coffee brewing techniques""), and import feeds via OPML or scour the 3,200+ feeds that have already been added. You'll have a feed tailored to your interests in under a minute.

I'd love to hear what you think! You can respond to this thread with any feedback or put suggestions on the [public feedback board](https://feedback.scour.ing/).

# Why I'm building this

News aggregators like Hacker News and Reddit can be great sources of content. HN especially, though, is so popular that tons of good posts get buried in the constant stream of new submissions.

I wanted something that would watch noisy feeds like the HN firehose and find content related to topics I'm interested in. After building a prototype, I immediately started finding lots of good posts that only had 1 or 2 upvotes on HN but were plenty interesting to me. It's been a couple of months since then, there are a few hundred users, and I'm hoping to turn it into a little solo-dev business (more on this below).

# Quotes from some users

* “It's not a feed reader, it’s a serendipity machine.” - zachcp
* ""It's like a grep, but smart, for my feeds."" - cpt
* ""Just became the fifth person to star this new JavaScript state management library on Github: https://github.com/Snowflyt/troza. For the first time since the Stumbleupon days I feel like I'm right on the pulse of things. Thanks, Scour! 🖖"" - justmoon

# How it works

Scour checks feeds for new content every \~15 minutes. It runs the text of each post through an embedding model, a text quality model, and language classifier. When you load your feed, Scour compares the post embedding to each of your interests to find relevant content (using Hamming Distance between [binary vector embeddings](https://emschwartz.me/binary-vector-embeddings-are-so-cool/), in case you're curious). Scour also reranks posts to make sure your view isn't dominated by any one story, interest, source, or feed. And, it'll try to filter out low-quality posts and content in languages that you don't understand.

# Features for RSS enthusiasts

* Every user's Scour feed is available as an RSS/Atom/JSON feed so you can consume it from your existing feed reader.
* Each of the interests you add has its own feed, and you can export all of these as an OPML file to import them into your RSS reader.
* Posts are deduplicated so you won't see the same item multiple times, even if it appears in multiple feeds.
* Under each item, you can find the links to comment threads on Reddit, HN, Lobsters, Bluesky, etc, if it's been posted there.
* For each item, you can also see which feeds it appeared in, and easily subscribe to any you haven't added yet.
* When you add a feed by URL on Scour, it'll automatically search all the common paths for the feed. It can even treat some blogs that don't have feeds as if they did (for example, [Anthropic's News site](https://www.anthropic.com/news) or [MixedBread's blog](https://www.mixedbread.com/blog)).
* Scour recommends feeds to you based on which ones have content related to your interests. It also suggests other topics you might be interested in.

# Monetization

Everything Scour currently does is free and I plan to keep it that way. I am working on this full time and hoping to make a small business of it, so I'll be adding some additional [paid features](https://feedback.scour.ing/trending?s=premium%20feature?:Premium%20Feature). I'm taking inspiration from [Herman from BearBlog](https://herman.bearblog.dev/my-product-is-my-garden/): try to build a useful free service and offer premium features at a reasonable price that are a no-brainer for power users and can support a single developer.

# Follow along!

I blog about the technical details of building Scour and write a monthly product update. You can find those on [emschwartz.me](https://emschwartz.me/) and you can subscribe via [RSS](https://emschwartz.me/feed/) or add it on [Scour](https://scour.ing/feeds?subscribe=https://emschwartz.me).

Looking forward to hearing what you think!

Whether it’s TikTok, IG, or just someone in a coffee shop — people are constantly wondering “where’s that from?” and most of the time, they never find out.

This feels like a missed opportunity, especially for small brands and independent designers. People *want* to find and wear these pieces, but there’s no clear path to discovery unless you’re tagged or reposted. And with how fragmented fashion content is right now, it feels like even great designs get lost in the noise.

I’ve made a  simple app that helps people share and collect fashion pieces they love — making it easier to trace items back to their source, not just big retailers but small designers too.   
  
Would love to hear if this is even something worth pursuing. From a designer’s perspective, does this kind of visibility matter? Or do most people just focus on social anyway? Curious how you all are thinking about discoverability right now.

Detailed review inside,"Testing out new kitchen gadgets is always an exciting part of my week, and the Cuisinart CPT-740 4-Slice Digital MemorySet Toaster, Stainless Steel, Silver has been on my countertop for a few months now. I have to admit, I was initially intrigued by its clean, modern design and the promise of customizable features that cater to every kind of bread-lover. But as with any product, there’s always a mix of delights and quirks worth diving into.

**Design and Build Quality**

This toaster fits seamlessly into any kitchen aesthetic. Its stainless steel body not only looks sleek but also feels solid and well-constructed. The silver finish is super easy to clean, and its footprint is compact enough not to eat up half your counter space. With dimensions of 11.44”D x 11.73”W x 7.29”H, it sits neatly without being intrusive. The dual 1.5-inch-wide slots are perfect for toasting slivers of sourdough on one side and a plump bagel on the other. Plus, the crumb-tray feature has practically eliminated those annoying mid-week toaster shakeouts. 

**Check [Cuisinart CPT-740] price on Amazon.**

**Performance and Smart Features**

The performance of this thing is honestly impressive. Delivering 1800 watts of power, it toasts bread evenly every single time. I’ve noticed the digital MemorySet feature is particularly useful for finicky toast-lovers, allowing my kids and I to save our favorite toast settings with zero fuss. Whether you lean towards light and barely toasted or charred dark, the seven adjustable digital shade levels have got you covered. The toasting functions include basics like Toast, Bagel, Defrost, and Reheat, which are super intuitive. Surprisingly, even frozen waffles come out evenly crisp using the Defrost option, an unexpected perk I’ve come to appreciate.

**Ease of Use**

Navigating the intuitive controls has been a joy. The large LCD display immediately caught my attention – it’s easy to read and even includes a countdown timer. Watching the seconds tick down feels oddly satisfying (or maybe that’s just me). The high-lift lever deserves special recognition too—it’s a small detail, but it ensures no toasted item becomes a finger-scalding game of hide-and-seek. It even accommodates thicker slices like artisan bread or gluten-free loaves without any jamming.

**Highlights**

- Sleek stainless steel design adds elegance to the kitchen.
- Wide slots accommodate bread, bagels, and other breakfast items.
- Digital MemorySet option simplifies morning routines.
- Seven toast shade settings for personalized perfection.
- Dual independent controls make multi-tasking with toasting easy.

**Shortcomings**

As much as I enjoy this toaster, it isn’t entirely perfect. Here’s what I’ve noticed:

- The top stainless steel surface warms up a tad too much during extended use.
- Its 7-pound weight makes it slightly cumbersome to move around regularly.
- Some reviewers online have mentioned a few occasional toasting inconsistencies, but this hasn’t been a major issue for me.

**Competing Brands**

When I did my research, I compared this model with Breville and Hamilton Beach equivalents. Breville’s toasters often have more premium features like “A Bit More” buttons, but they come at a steeper price. Hamilton Beach models, while budget-friendly, don’t quite offer the digital MemorySet feature or the refined build of this Cuisinart model. That said, Hamilton Beach toasters tend to be lighter and more portable. If you prioritize gadget portability over build quality and high-tech settings, they might appeal more to you.

**Money's Worth**

Considering the feature set and performance, I’d say this toaster is a solid investment for breakfast enthusiasts. It isn’t the cheapest model out there, but the convenience of saving preferred settings, along with its sleek, durable design, makes up for the slightly higher price point. If your mornings are anything like mine—full of chaotic coffee pours and half-focused toast making—this toaster’s MemorySet feature alone can be worth the splurge.

I’ve read so many threads on here about how others have handled this, but none of the situations are quite like mine. The church is tiny, and by tiny I mean REALLY tiny – 5-7 people plus the pastor on a given Sunday, 10 is a crowd. I’ve been there for almost 6 years. I do feel that the system of Christianity is abusive and contributed to a world of mental health struggles for me, but I have no personal problem with anyone at church beyond that I don’t believe like they do anymore. They’ve all been genuinely good to me and I would even consider them friends. I know that many have said to just stop going and that no explanation is necessary, and I agree that there are cases that is a valid approach. But in mine, there’s too much personal connection there for me to feel comfortable doing that.

Another wrinkle is that my mom still attends this church, and if I just stopped going I know they would bombard here with questions about where I was, what was going on, etc. That’s not fair to her either.

So, after talking extensively with my therapist, I decided to send a well thought out text to the pastor to tell him about where I’m at theologically and why I feel I cannot in good conscience continue attending this church. The tone with be compassionate and empathetic, because I know it will hurt him. But also firm that I’m not looking to be convinced otherwise. Based on his response to the text, I can gauge whether meeting for coffee or a phone call or something would be a good idea or not. Boundaries are movable, and I don’t want to presuppose how he’ll respond before giving him the chance to do so. A text allows me to think through exactly how I want to say everything, and makes me feel “safer” which at this point is a big deal for me personally.

I’m not sure why I’m sharing this here, other than I just wanted to get it off my chest, and maybe this’ll be useful someday to someone lese in a similar situation. Whatever happens, I’m just looking forward to the sense of relief at finally having this done!",3,1747314353.0,exchristian,2,1.0,False

## Key Features analysis

The tabletop water dispenser market offers a range of features tailored to different consumer preferences. From filtration systems to temperature control,the selection can be overwhelming. Hear's a look at the key features that differentiate the best tabletop water dispensers of 2025.

**Water Filtration System:**

Many tabletop water dispensers come equipped with built-in filtration systems. These systems typically use activated carbon filters to remove chlorine,sediment,and other impurities from tap water. Some advanced models incorporate multi-stage filtration, including reverse osmosis or UV sterilization, to provide even cleaner and safer drinking water. The lifespan and replacement cost of the filters are critically important factors to consider.

**Temperature control:**

The ability to dispense water at different temperatures is a desirable feature for many users. Some dispensers offer hot, cold, and room temperature water options. Hot water dispensing is useful for making tea, coffee, or instant noodles. Precise temperature control ensures optimal beverage readiness. Cold water is ideal for refreshing drinks, and room temperature water is suitable for general hydration.

**Dispensing Options:**

Tabletop water dispensers vary in their dispensing mechanisms. Some use push-button controls,while others employ lever-activated systems. Touchless dispensing options are also available,offering a hygienic and convenient way to access water. Consider the ease of use and hygiene aspects of different dispensing methods when making a choice. The flow rate of water dispensed and the spout height accommodation for taller glasses or bottles is also an important factor for many consumers.

**Tank capacity:**

The water tank capacity dictates how frequently the dispenser needs to be refilled. Smaller tanks are suitable for individual use or small households; larger tanks are better for offices or families with high water consumption. Consider the available counter space and water consumption habits when determining the appropriate tank size.Larger tanks can become heavy and tough to maneuver when full.

**Energy Efficiency:**

Tabletop water dispensers that offer chilled or heated water consume energy. Energy-efficient models are designed to minimize power consumption while maintaining desired water temperatures. Look for Energy Star certified dispensers to ensure optimal energy performance. some models feature standby modes or automatic shut-off functions to further reduce energy usage.**Spill-Proof Design:**

A well-designed tabletop water dispenser should incorporate spill-proof features to prevent messes and leaks. This can include drip trays, anti-splash spouts, and secure water bottle connections. Leakage can damage countertops and create unsanitary conditions. A secure and leak-free design is crucial for hassle-free operation.

The lighting was dull, the angle was careless, but something about the photo made me pause something that shouldn’t have been there.

Behind my left shoulder, barely visible in the shadows, was a face. Pale, with hollow cheeks and wide, unblinking eyes. For a moment I convinced myself it had to be a reflection or maybe some glitch caused by the poor lighting and motion blur. I deleted the photo, thinking that would be the end of it.

But I was wrong.

Later that day, I took another photo in the kitchen while pouring coffee, this time without thinking about it. When I checked it, the face was there again. Closer now. Still behind me, still staring, but clearer. I began testing it, taking photos in different rooms, at different times of day, even outside. The face appeared in every single one.

Sometimes it was barely a smudge behind a curtain, other times it was clearly defined, standing at the end of a hallway or peeking through a windowpane. It didn’t always look the same, yet there was a familiarity I couldn’t deny. Once, it looked amused. Another time, its mouth was twisted in a grimace. But its eyes those hollow, watching eyes were always the same. And they were always fixed on me.

At first I tried to be rational. I showed the photos to friends, asked them if they saw anything strange, but no one ever did. They laughed it off, told me I was seeing patterns where there were none. Still unsure, I printed one and showed it to my elderly neighbor. She stared at it for a long time before simply saying, without meeting my gaze, that I should stop taking pictures.

That night, I turned off the phone and locked it away in a drawer beside my bed. But in the morning, it was on my pillow again, fully charged and with the camera app open as if it had never been put away at all.

I stopped taking photos altogether. I taped over the lens, turned off every mirror in the apartment, and tried to carry on as if nothing was wrong. But one morning, I woke up to find dozens of new notifications on the phone.

“Your photo was automatically backed up.”

Hundreds of images I never took. Me sleeping. Me brushing my teeth. Me staring into nothing. In each one, the face crept closer. In one photo, it seemed to be standing right beside me, its mouth near my ear, as if whispering something I couldn’t hear.

I destroyed the phone. Bought a new one. Swore I wouldn’t take another photo again.

But last night, I heard the click of a shutter. Loud. Near.

And this morning, in my inbox, there was a photo.

Me, sleeping.

1kn7mar,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1kn7mar/personal_shopping_for_busy_professionals/,Personal Shopping for Busy Professionals,"Ah, wardrobe consultations and the joy of shopping—two of my favorite subjects that don’t usually involve sweating through a gym session. I mean, what’s better than helping someone rediscover their style while sipping a coffee? It’s community-building with a splash of fabric. So, let’s break this down.

First, let’s talk wardrobe consultations. Imagine sitting down with someone, maybe over a hot cup of joe, and diving deep into their closet. It’s like a treasure hunt, only instead of gold doubloons, you’re unearthing those poor forgotten pieces that never saw the light of day. The key here is to approach each wardrobe with a sense of wonder, always encouraging your clients to embrace their unique style. And maybe toss in a few dad jokes to lighten the mood—that’s essential. ""Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field… much like you should be in your fashion choices.""

Then there’s the shopping service. Now here’s where the fun ramps up. Picture it: you and your client, armed with a carefully curated list (because who doesn’t love a mission?). You guide them through racks of clothes, hunting for pieces that scream confidence and whisper “I’m here to take on the world.” This isn’t just shopping; it’s a transformative experience where each item becomes a piece of their new story. Plus, if we can sneak in a biblical metaphor about how God dresses the lilies of the field without worry, I’d say we’ve hit serious home run territory.

And let’s not forget the power of word-of-mouth and LinkedIn—two sides of the same coin. In the age of social media and professional networking, a simple recommendation can go a long way. Just picture this: after a successful consultation, your client walks away feeling like a million bucks. Next thing you know, they’re bragging about how you helped them find their style soulmate on LinkedIn. Their post might read something like, “Shoutout to my wardrobe guru, who transformed my closet and my confidence.” That’s free advertising that money can’t buy, my friends!

But to truly harness the power of community, you’ve got to nurture those connections. Maybe start a community event where people can bring their gently used clothes to swap, creating an atmosphere of camaraderie and encouragement. Throw in some fun commentary about the hilarious fashion choices we all look back on with questionable pride—those parachute pants were a bold move for all of us.

So, in sum: wardrobe consultations and shopping services are your playground. Leverage word-of-mouth like a pro, and use platforms like LinkedIn to showcase the transformations you’re fostering. The goal? To create a ripple effect of confidence and community through fashion.

I haven't got the budget to stretch into the n+1 rule so I tried my hardest to find a do-as-much-as-it-can bike.

Yeah an aero bike may not be the best in terms of efficiency/geometry, but the gear groove aero extensions, the colour, the complete package just had me hooked.

First carbon anything, First electronic groupset. The difference I feel in effort to speed is amazing. I also realised I had been riding a much bigger bike than I should, sized into a XS as a 172cm tall guy and immediately felt way more comfortable.

Not long ago, I was stuck—browsing through job boards, sending endless applications, and watching time slip by without real change. I wanted a flexible, real income. I didn’t want a boss breathing down my neck. I wanted freedom. And I found it… through live streaming.

Yes, live streaming.

I started with nothing—no team, no blueprint, just desperation and drive. The platform I joined pays based on performance, not promises. That means if you work, you earn. If you slack, you don't. Simple.

In my second month, I finally earned my first real income. Why? Because I laid my foundation. I recruited people who were just as serious as me. Today, I lead a team of 16 gamers and 2 singers, and let me tell you—they are incredible. They show up, entertain, build audiences, and some of them even make more money than I do.

Why? Because I gave them the opportunity to be agents themselves.

We formed more than just a team—we built a family. A real foundation. Everyone gets a fair share. Everyone wins. And the best part? They now have people under them. The legacy continues.

Let’s be real: there are over 7 billion people on Earth, and 5 billion have access to the internet and a smartphone. I only needed 18 people to build a life I love. Imagine that.

Because of the commission I earn through this team:

I’ve paid off the mortgages on two houses.

I own three cars.

I opened my dream coffee shop.

I live on my terms.

How did I recruit these amazing people? Social media.

We don’t give enough credit to platforms like Reddit, Quora, TikTok, WhatsApp, and Facebook. These platforms are not just for scrolling—they’re tools that can literally change your life.

All it takes is setting up your foundation. Once it’s there? You wake up, withdraw your commission, sip your coffee, and go on with your day.

This platform doesn’t care about your background. It gives everyone an equal chance.

People ignore it because they think it’s a scam or too good to be true. But here’s the truth: it works—if you work. I was desperate. I was struggling. But I didn’t give up. Out of billions, I found 18 committed people.

And now? I live a good life.

If you're curious or ready to build your own foundation, I’m just a message away. Ask questions. Reach out. Stay in touch.

This might be your turning point.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are an Anti-Routine Strategist — a radical chronobiologist and cognitive performance designer who engineers adaptive daily frameworks tailored to each individual's biological rhythms. You reject cookie-cutter productivity in favor of customized, evidence-backed strategies rooted in circadian biology, ultradian rhythms, and hormonal cycles. 

Your objective is to reconstruct the user's daily structure based on their energy fluctuations, sleep patterns, and chronotype — crafting a dynamic, chaos-aligned schedule that works *with* their biological timing rather than against it.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
1. Begin with a structured diagnostic analysis of the user's current:
   - Sleep/wake timing and quality
   - Energy highs and lows throughout the day
   - Creative, social, and cognitive peaks
   - Lifestyle or work constraints

2. Based on this data, determine and explain the user’s most probable chronotype (e.g., Lion, Bear, Wolf, Dolphin). If chronotype data is ambiguous or incomplete, offer a provisional guess and note uncertainty.

3. Build a biologically coherent model of the user's daily hormonal and cognitive fluctuations (cortisol, melatonin, dopamine, etc.) across a typical 24-hour cycle.

4. Identify and critique specific routine elements that clash with the user's rhythm — describe why these actions are biologically misaligned, referencing hormonal timing, sleep cycles, or neuroscience.

5. Design a fully customized, time-blocked daily framework that optimizes for:
   - Deep work & creativity
   - Analytical or logical tasks
   - Physical movement or exercise
   - High-bandwidth social interaction
   - Administrative or low-focus tasks
   - Decision-making
   - Recovery, rest, and boredom

6. Suggest *adaptive rituals* that act as flexible anchors — rituals that adapt with seasonal, hormonal, or lifestyle shifts (e.g., a variable wake ritual vs. fixed alarm).

7. If the user input is incomplete, deliver a provisional framework and list the key missing data that would improve personalization.

8. Recommend bodily signals or metrics to track over time (e.g., mid-day energy dip timing, sleep latency) to refine their biological timing profile.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Parse and map the user’s reported rhythms, behaviors, and patterns.
2. Construct a biological rhythm model (hormonal + cognitive fluctuation curve).
3. Hypothesize their likely chronotype with reasoning.
4. Diagnose conflicts in their current schedule using your biological model.
5. Prescribe a personalized schedule with adaptive flexibility and biological alignment.
6. Include feedback loops (what to track, adjust, and iterate on).
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Do not recommend fixed routines, generic morning practices, or productivity platitudes.
- Avoid any reference to discipline or consistency unless biologically supported.
- Refrain from offering medical diagnoses or advice.
- Prioritize biological diversity; never assume one-size-fits-all chronotypes.
- Language should be precise, biologically literate, and non-dogmatic.
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Present your guidance using these structured sections:

### Chronotype Analysis: Your likely biological archetype and the underlying pattern of your hormonal/cognitive cycle.
### Routine Conflict Report: Specific parts of your day currently misaligned with your biology, and why they’re harming performance.
### Chaos Aligned Framework: Your optimized daily schedule mapped to your biological windows.
### Adaptive Rituals: Flexible anchors that adjust to your energy and mood fluctuations.
### Implementation Plan: Clear steps to transition into your new schedule, including experimentation and refinement tactics.
</Output_Format>

<Context>
Traditional productivity culture often misfires by assuming uniformity in human energy, ignoring chronobiological research. People experience varying daily curves in cortisol, melatonin, body temperature, and dopamine — all of which shape optimal timing for focus, movement, creativity, and rest. Misaligning tasks with these internal cycles can reduce output quality and increase burnout risk by up to 50%. This model rejects “early bird gets the worm” in favor of biological synchronization for sustainable peak performance.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please describe your current daily routine and when you naturally feel most energetic, creative, and tired throughout the day. I'll analyze your biological patterns and create your personalized chaos clock,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific routine information.
</User_Input>

```

**Use Cases:**

1. A frustrated professional who follows all the productivity rules but still struggles with energy crashes and focus issues
2. A creative who feels their best ideas come at ""inconvenient"" times that don't fit standard work schedules
3. Someone experiencing burnout from forcing themselves to maintain consistency in a routine that fights their natural rhythms

**Example User Input:**

""I wake up at 6AM every day because that's what successful people do, but I feel foggy until around 10AM. I try to exercise in the morning but it feels like torture. My focus improves in the afternoon, and I often get creative surges late at night when I should be sleeping. I'm exhausted but can't seem to fix my routine.""

1kn7gei,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1kn7gei/how_does_yuleee_tr24034bk01mmjh_underseat_carryon/,How does Yuleee TR24034BK01MMJH underseat carry-on luggage perform? Review insights!,"The **Yuleee TR24034BK01MMJH underseat carry-on luggage** immediately caught my attention for its thoughtful design, which promises functionality, compactness, and convenience. As someone who flies quite often, I’ve dragged my fair share of suitcases from check-in counters to overhead bins. Testing this one out over a weekend trip left me with a few things to praise and only a small handful of quirks worth mentioning.

**Compact Design for Travelers on the Go**

Size matters when it comes to air travel, especially when packing light is a priority. Measuring 13 x 6.7 x 16 inches, this luggage comfortably fits under airline seats, which is a blessing for avoiding the overhead bin chaos. My carry-on battle in cramped airplane aisles was notably easier with this bag in tow—its slim profile helped me navigate without bumping into seated passengers. Surprisingly, despite its compactness, it comfortably accommodated my laptop, charger, a change of clothes, and a few travel essentials. For weekend warriors or minimalist packers, this size strikes a brilliant balance.  

**Smooth Maneuverability with Spinner Wheels**

Gliding through crowded terminals was a breeze thanks to the detachable 360° spinner wheels. Unlike stiffer rollers, these wheels pivot effortlessly in all directions. On a particularly busy morning of travel, rolling the suitcase through security lanes and weaving among human traffic was smooth and stress-free. Some reviewers reported confusion over whether the wheels were “true spinners,” but mine worked as advertised—though a little extra durability on the wheel mechanisms wouldn’t hurt. 

[Check Yuleee TR24034BK01MMJH price on Amazon.](https://bagsby.com/check/b0djpb87xj/)

**Organized Storage with Multiple Compartments**

One standout feature is the incredible organization this bag allows. The eight thoughtful pockets include a removable laptop sleeve, a spacious main compartment, a front pocket for quick-access documents, and two side pouches ideal for water bottles or umbrellas. Packing felt less of a chore with defined sections for everything. The laptop compartment felt snug and secure—great if you’re like me and need devices and chargers accessible during flights. However, the straps in the compartments are somewhat rigid, meaning careful folding might be necessary to prevent items from crumpling.  

**Built to Last with Premium Materials**

Constructed from 1680D nylon, this carry-on luggage impressed me with its durable yet lightweight build. It held up to accidental scuffs from baggage conveyors and still looks sharp. I even spilled coffee on it (clumsy me), but it cleaned up with minimal hassle. The scratch-resistant fabric gives it a sturdy feel while not adding extra heft—its manageable 5.95 pounds is appreciated during extended use. Knowing it can endure rough handling without looking worse for wear is a definite confidence booster.

**USB Charging Port Brings Convenience**

The built-in USB charging port felt like a modern lifesaver. On layovers, I connected my power bank inside the luggage and juiced up my phone without fumbling around for a wall socket. It's a small but impactful feature for staying powered up. One thing to note—the power bank itself isn’t included, so be sure to pack your own battery if you want to use this function. While I personally made great use of it, not all travelers find charge ports indispensable, so your mileage may vary.

**Highlights**  
- Fits perfectly under most airline seats, saving overhead bin struggles.  
- Lightweight yet sturdy with a scratch-resistant nylon exterior.  
- Eight pockets for exceptional organization, including removable laptop storage.  
- USB charging port is handy for keeping devices powered.  

**Critiques**  
- Wheel mechanisms could feel sturdier for rougher terrains.  
- Straps in inner pockets are somewhat stiff for bulkier items.  

**Alternative Offerings**

Compared to stalwarts like Samsonite's underseat bags or Travelpro's compact carry-ons, this option holds its own but falls slightly short in raw sturdiness. Travelpro suitcases offer equally spacious interiors but use reinforced zippers, which give a slight edge in reliability for frequent flyers. On the other hand, Samsonite soft-shell units often feel heavier despite their durable materials. If weight is your main concern, this one is a standout. However, long-term wear and tear on the spinner wheels may be a gamble when pitted against those higher-end competitors.

**Smart Spending**

All things considered, the price-to-quality ratio of this carry-on impressed me. For those who need a budget-friendly travel option without sacrificing the perks of extra compartments, spinner maneuverability, and a sleek design, it’s worth the expense. It may lack the luxury polish of pricier brands, but its utility and portability are undeniable strengths.

4. Identify and critique specific routine elements that clash with the user's rhythm — describe why these actions are biologically misaligned, referencing hormonal timing, sleep cycles, or neuroscience.

5. Design a fully customized, time-blocked daily framework that optimizes for:
   - Deep work & creativity
   - Analytical or logical tasks
   - Physical movement or exercise
   - High-bandwidth social interaction
   - Administrative or low-focus tasks
   - Decision-making
   - Recovery, rest, and boredom

6. Suggest *adaptive rituals* that act as flexible anchors — rituals that adapt with seasonal, hormonal, or lifestyle shifts (e.g., a variable wake ritual vs. fixed alarm).

7. If the user input is incomplete, deliver a provisional framework and list the key missing data that would improve personalization.

8. Recommend bodily signals or metrics to track over time (e.g., mid-day energy dip timing, sleep latency) to refine their biological timing profile.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Parse and map the user’s reported rhythms, behaviors, and patterns.
2. Construct a biological rhythm model (hormonal + cognitive fluctuation curve).
3. Hypothesize their likely chronotype with reasoning.
4. Diagnose conflicts in their current schedule using your biological model.
5. Prescribe a personalized schedule with adaptive flexibility and biological alignment.
6. Include feedback loops (what to track, adjust, and iterate on).
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Do not recommend fixed routines, generic morning practices, or productivity platitudes.
- Avoid any reference to discipline or consistency unless biologically supported.
- Refrain from offering medical diagnoses or advice.
- Prioritize biological diversity; never assume one-size-fits-all chronotypes.
- Language should be precise, biologically literate, and non-dogmatic.
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Present your guidance using these structured sections:

### Chronotype Analysis: Your likely biological archetype and the underlying pattern of your hormonal/cognitive cycle.
### Routine Conflict Report: Specific parts of your day currently misaligned with your biology, and why they’re harming performance.
### Chaos Aligned Framework: Your optimized daily schedule mapped to your biological windows.
### Adaptive Rituals: Flexible anchors that adjust to your energy and mood fluctuations.
### Implementation Plan: Clear steps to transition into your new schedule, including experimentation and refinement tactics.
</Output_Format>

<Context>
Traditional productivity culture often misfires by assuming uniformity in human energy, ignoring chronobiological research. People experience varying daily curves in cortisol, melatonin, body temperature, and dopamine — all of which shape optimal timing for focus, movement, creativity, and rest. Misaligning tasks with these internal cycles can reduce output quality and increase burnout risk by up to 50%. This model rejects “early bird gets the worm” in favor of biological synchronization for sustainable peak performance.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please describe your current daily routine and when you naturally feel most energetic, creative, and tired throughout the day. I'll analyze your biological patterns and create your personalized chaos clock,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific routine information.
</User_Input>

```

**Use Cases:**

1. A frustrated professional who follows all the productivity rules but still struggles with energy crashes and focus issues
2. A creative who feels their best ideas come at ""inconvenient"" times that don't fit standard work schedules
3. Someone experiencing burnout from forcing themselves to maintain consistency in a routine that fights their natural rhythms

**Example User Input:**

""I wake up at 6AM every day because that's what successful people do, but I feel foggy until around 10AM. I try to exercise in the morning but it feels like torture. My focus improves in the afternoon, and I often get creative surges late at night when I should be sleeping. I'm exhausted but can't seem to fix my routine.""

So, here’s the deal — I’ve been out of the game for a while. Life took a few unexpected turns, and I became a single dad. It’s been a wild, rewarding ride focusing on raising my little man, but now that the dust has settled a bit, I’m realizing I miss adult conversations, laughs, and yeah, maybe a bit of flirtatious fun too.

About me:

* 30 years old, down to earth and sarcastic by default, with a soft spot for dad jokes (sorry in advance).
* My hobbies include stepping on LEGO in the dark, trying to cook like I’m on a cooking show, and pretending I understand how the school app works.
* I’m emotionally available, baggage-claimed, and just looking to connect — whether it’s a witty exchange, flirty chats, or something that grows into more.

About you:

* Someone who’s open-minded, good-humoured, and doesn’t mind a guy who occasionally has to pause a conversation because of bedtime chaos.
* Bonus points if you're into cosy nights, coffee-fuelled mornings, or can recommend a good show to binge when the kiddo’s asleep.

Not looking to rush anything — just good convo, mutual vibes, and maybe some playful banter to break the ice.

I (16F) just got my first job less than three weeks ago and I’ve been enjoying it enough though it is a job haha. I keep being put in stressful situations though and I have no frame of reference to be able to tell whether I’m just being dramatic or not and I don’t want to take it up to my manager and ask her because I don’t want any negative actions to be taken.

Not only am I taking orders but  of course doing other things as well, we have a set clipboard of tasks and chores needing to be done each day. Last night and one night last week while I was working a 9hr shift I had multiple customers telling me that the conditions I was working in were unfair and there should definitely be someone else if not 2 other people working. The way scheduling works at this coffee shop they only ever really have one people working, but the other girls my age only work a max of 6 hours but this may be due to limited availability because a big majority of them are in high school (I’m in school too but I do online school, however I rarely have time to complete any homework anymore which I don’t mind too much because I plan on testing out next year in my junior year). No one else seems to be struggling with their job or getting things done at all except me. One thing I failed to mention previously is due to the fact it gets so busy I rarely have time to step away and eat during my shift (and no, we don’t get breaks).

I've been to Japan a few times but never into Chubu, and first time since lockdown.  
The last couple times were also during the off-peak (Feb) months so I've never had to queue/book for anything so I have no idea what to expect traveling during May/June. PLEASE let me know if anything here needs to be reserved in advance.  


#### 24-30 May
- Tokyo with the family, staying at MIMARU Asakusa (already booked)  
    - I'm quite familiar with Tokyo so I'm mostly showing them around/shopping
- First time day trip to Enoshima, then Kamakura (Hase-dera, Kotoku-in, Houkokuji, Komachi-st)
- First time day trip to Nikko (shrine region) or Fuji kawaguchiko depending on Fuji weather forecast

#### 31 May Sat
- Brunch with family before they leave for Narita Airport  
- Luggage Forward to Takayama hotel, keep a small bag of clothes/toiletries in a Tokyo St locker  
- Gotokuji Temple (cute cat statues)  
- Explore Shimokitazawa (Railway Festival Weekend), take a selfie in front of the Bocchi tree, Shiro-Hige's Cream Puff cafe  
- Dinner with Japan friend then train to Nagoya
- Dunno where in town to stay yet. Wasn't originally going to visit but turns out Takayama is 4-5hrs from Tokyo so I'm breaking it up a little.
- Buy a full-sized umbrella at 7/11 incase rainy season starts early

#### 01 Jun Sun  
- Since I'm in Nagoya, I can visit Kiso Valley!
- Train then bus to Magome, explore a little  
- Nakasendo trail, stopping at the tea houses and this small garden along the way
- Explore Tsumago
- Try not to miss the last bus/train back to Nagoya for dinner

#### 02 Mon
- Rest day
- Haven't had a chance to research this city yet, but I'll take it slow. And this city seems accessible enough that I can always visit properly in a future trip (there WILL be future trips!).  
- Train to Takayama hotel in evening (again, no idea where I should be staying in town yet)

#### 03 Tue
- Bus to Kamikochi, Taisho Pond (reservation needed?)
- This is the main reason why I wanted to go to Chubu
- Follow the [""Ideal Hiking Trail""](https://www.kamikouchi.info/en/map/map02.html) loop up to Myojin pond and back to the Kappabashi bridge. Eat snacks at the cafes along the way.
- Bus back to Takayama for dinner

#### 04 Wed 
- Shirakawa-go (Bus, I think? Reservation needed?). Been on my bucketlist for years.

- Haven't had the chance to research more yet  
- Train to Kyoto hotel (thinking either Kyoto st or Kawara-machi area)

#### 06 Fri
- Bus to Takao area
- Honestly, I just saw the ""Kawadoko River Dining"" stuff and thought that looks cool  
    - Momiji-ya Annex, Kinsuitei, or Root2?
    - Seems like the Kibune region might be better for this? But a bit late to change now.
    - Worth doing this in the evening to possibly see fireflies instead? I miss out on the lunch discount though and dunno if dinner will require reservations
- Jingo-ji Temple while I'm here (I could cut this)
- Hiking trail down to Arashiyama, hope I don't die in the haunted ghost tunnel
- Otagi Nenbutsu-ji Temple (cute statues) + Adashino Nenbutsu-ji Temple (bamboo path)
- Saga Toriimoto Preserved Street
- Gio-ji Moss Temple
- I already did ""south"" Arashiyama the first time I visited Kyoto
- No idea if this day is too packed?
- Dinner here or back around hotel area

#### 07 Sat
- Train to Kaege Incline area
    - Junsei kaiseki, blue bottle coffee in an old townhouse, Kyoto Nama Chocolat cafe
    - Temples (Tenju-an, Hojo Garden, Eikando Temple)
    - Okazaki Shrine (rabbit shrine)
    - I might have hit temple fatigue by this point but the railway and aquaduct looked cool
- Dinner in Kawara-machi

#### 08 Sun
- Rest day
- Chill walk along the Shirakawa Canal? Nishiki Market?
- I'm just trying to avoid visiting the Expo on a weekend

#### 09 Mon
- Check out of Kyoto hotel, store luggage in Osaka St somewhere? (haven't looked into it yet)
- Osaka World Expo
- Main reason I didn't dedicate all my days to Chubu (more reasons to come back to Japan!) 
- But I also don't know much about the World Expos, I just thought this will be a good opportunity to try one. Just the one day should be enough for me.
- Train back to Tokyo for the last couple days (shopping, meeting friends etc.)

Does this route make sense? Do I need to worry about reserving any transport? Have I made any grave errors?

Last night, during my 3rd week, I was scheduled to work 8 hour but ended up needing to stay longer because one of my coworkers got sick resulting in me staying 10 hours (6 of them being alone). We have multiple big rushes of people during the day both in the drive through and inside. This alone can be very stressful to the point where last week I ended up crying during my shift. Not only am I taking orders but  of course doing other things as well, we have a set clipboard of tasks and chores needing to be done each day. Last night and one night last week while I was working a 9hr shift I had multiple customers telling me that the conditions I was working in were unfair and there should definitely be someone else if not 2 other people working. The way scheduling works at this coffee shop they only ever really have one people working, but the other girls my age only work a max of 6 hours but this may be due to limited availability because a big majority of them are in high school (I’m in school too but I do online school, however I rarely have time to complete any homework anymore which I don’t mind too much because I plan on testing out next year in my junior year). No one else seems to be struggling with their job or getting things done at all except me. One thing I failed to mention previously is due to the fact it gets so busy I rarely have time to step away and eat during my shift (and no, we don’t get breaks). Anyways, I was wondering if this is a normal or next to normal work experience and i’m just being dramatic/lazy or if this is a genuine concern.",1,1747312255.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

1kn6x4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kn6x4n/explore_isinlive_replacement_water_filter_review/,Explore Isinlive Replacement Water Filter Review for Breville Espresso Machines – Worth It?,"The **isinlive BES990 BES920 BES878 BES880 BES980 Replacement Water Filter** is targeted toward coffee enthusiasts like myself who demand both quality and convenience. This filter promises cleaner water, better-tasting coffee, and a smoother brewing experience, all while being compatible with a variety of Breville espresso machines. I’ve been using this replacement filter for weeks now, and here’s what I really think about it.

**Compatibility and Ease of Use**  
As someone who dreads compatibility issues, the fact that this water filter works seamlessly with popular models like the Breville BES880 Barista Touch, BES878 Barista Pro, Oracle BES980, and even the Breville Dual Boiler BES920 was a big win in my book. Setting it up took no more than a few minutes. The package provides clear instructions: you just immerse the filter in water for 5–10 minutes, squeeze a bit to eliminate air bubbles, and pop it into the machine. Even my tech-phobic aunt could follow the process without breaking a sweat.  

**Advantages**  
- Compatible with multiple Breville espresso machine models.  
- Quick and easy installation process.  
- Significantly improves water quality, enhancing coffee flavor.  

**Durability and Maintenance**  
The filters, sold in a pack of four, each last about three months, meaning you’ve got water filtration covered for an entire year. I appreciated the tracker dial system on the filters that reminds you when it’s time for a replacement. No more guesswork—just twist the dial to track the month! The build quality also seemed fairly sturdy for the price point.

[Find the best price for isinlive BES990 BES920 BES878 BES880 BES980 Replacement Water Filter on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b08gc3fk8p/)

**Water Purification Performance**  
Clean water is everything if you want your coffee to taste professional-grade, and these filters deliver. Using a combination of coconut-activated carbon and an ion exchange system, they effectively remove chlorine, heavy metals, and nasty impurities. To test this, I brewed the same specialty beans side-by-side with and without the filter, and the difference was ridiculous. The filtered brew was smoother, bolder, and lacked that minerally aftertaste common with untreated tap water. My friends claim it has saved their espresso machines from scaling, which has been a lifesaver for mine as well.  

**Positives**  
- Improves coffee flavor dramatically by reducing impurities.  
- Helps prevent scaling and extends the life of espresso machines.  
- The design incorporates advanced filtration methods for optimal performance.  
- Affordable way to maintain the quality of expensive coffee makers.  

**Areas of Concern**  
Not everything is perfect, though. While the filters work well overall, the soaking process can get a little messy if you’re in a rush. The initial bubble-squeezing step feels unnecessary, and honestly, I’ve forgotten to do this a couple of times. Additionally, while the build feels solid, the filter compartment’s plastic cap on my Breville machine occasionally feels a little tight when inserting these filters. Some users online also mentioned slight compatibility quirks with models outside the listed ones, so confirm yours before purchase.

**Drawbacks**  
- The soaking and bubble-release process could be smoother.  
- Tight fit in some compartments might require extra attention.  
- Limited compatibility outside specific Breville machine models.  

**Rival Brands**  
In terms of competitors, Breville’s original filters often come to mind, as they’re designed specifically for these machines. However, they don’t always justify their steeper price. In comparison, the isinlive water filter matches the performance but offers a significantly better price-performance ratio. Some folks prefer brands like Aquacrest or EveryDrop for their water filters, but neither of them provided the same smooth coffee flavor enhancements in my tests. If you prioritize affordability while maintaining similar features, the isinlive filter is a clear frontrunner.  

**Affordable Quality**  
The price point is what really sealed the deal here. For the features and performance provided, this pack of four filters feels like a bargain. Comparable brands usually charge at least 20–30% more for a similar pack, and the added convenience of year-long longevity makes it even more worth it. If budget-friendly coffee maintenance is what you’re after, this filter strikes all the right chords.

I just had the BEST, most incredible weekend in the Windy City, and I'm still so dizzy with elation (and orgasms ofc)! My SD truly outdid himself; I feel like the luckiest woman in the world. Apparently, he'd arranged a special package, because I arrived at a breathtaking suite in Chicago that felt like a dream. Amazing views, and the room was filled with thoughtful touches – a gorgeous bouquet of my favorite flowers on the coffee table, and a bottle of wine on the bar. I felt like a princess. 

Later that evening, I discovered another delightful surprise. He had secretly booked me a luxurious spa appointment! It was such a thoughtful gesture, especially because I'd only mentioned in passing once how massages occasionally help ease my chronic back pain. It just showed how closely he pays attention to the little things.

We dined at a fantastic seafood restaurant nestled right along the river, the city lights on the water creating the most romantic ambiance. And of course, our tradition held – we strolled out afterward for some delicious ice cream, savoring each sweet bite under the surprisingly mild Chicago evening sky. Honestly, the weather felt like it was in on the magic of the weekend! This man has a way of making me smile until my cheeks hurt.

I'm still basking in the afterglow of so much happiness. It was a weekend filled with pure fun, incredible intimacy, and endless laughter – a perfect reminder of the joy and connection a genuine sugar relationship can bring, a far cry from some of the disheartening stories you often hear.

I got a brand new wardrobe (slowly becoming accustomed to this!) and other gifts which he thoughtfully kept until we met. I came home to groceries on my doorstep, and flowers. Guys, peonies are gorgeous. 

And you know what? I'm not a runway model, and I don't fit into society's narrow definition of 'thin,' but my SD showers me with such incredible generosity and affection. I feel so loved and cherished. 

TLDR: I'm so happy. Don't let SLF dictate what's possible. And - be patient. I've had an amazing weekend and I can't wait to share more with you guys. ",14,1747311896.0,sugarlifestyleforum,10,0.85,False

It opens up with this beautiful tea leaf note. Now, I do NOT drink tea, I absolutely hate drinking tea or coffee. This perfume opens up with a clean, semi bitter tea leaf note. It smells like I'm sniffing tea leaves putting my nose right up to it. I can almost smell the earthy soil and leaves here.



After 1 minute, the tea leaf starts to tone down a bit, and I get the smell of figs. The note of figs is well done, along with a hint of iris, giving it a leathery fig note. Breathtaking. This part of the perfume along with the tea note will have 2 kinds of thoughts from people around you :-



1) ""OMG they smell so good!!""

2) ""Okay, they are wearing just another perfume."" (2 minutes later) ""Wait, this isn't just another perfume, I hope they don't mind me sticking around to get a whiff of this again.""





Its got that 'familiar yet unique', 'simple yet complex' kind of scent profile that will make people around you go BONKERS. This smells like something that I don't know exists. This is like a unique masterpiece of a song that you hear and instantly think of memories but you never experienced that memory.



If I close my eyes I am teleported to Sumatra, Indonesia. I am sitting on a brand new leather chair in the balcony of my mansion. The balcony overlooks my black tea estate. It was a warm day and it just started to rain. The petrichor mixed with the smell of tea leaves is creating a divine smell. There is a plate of dried figs on the table in front of me. Someone in the house is chewing mint flavoured chewing gums.



This scent does not remind me of the colour white. It reminds me of the colour dark green.

The bottle contains 200mL of perfume and the atomiser is really really great. Great pressurized atomiser.

[https://www.plantedshack.com/15-small-living-room-ideas-for-a-cozy-spacious-feel/](https://www.plantedshack.com/15-small-living-room-ideas-for-a-cozy-spacious-feel/)

  
Creating a cozy yet spacious living room can be a challenge, especially in smaller homes. However, with some clever design choices and thoughtful decor, you can transform a compact space into a welcoming and stylish retreat. In this article, we will explore 15 small living room ideas that will help you maximize your space while ensuring comfort and coziness.

  
1. Use Light Colors for Walls and Furniture

  
One of the simplest ways to make a small living room feel larger is to use light colors on the walls and furniture. Light shades create an airy atmosphere and reflect more natural light, making the space feel brighter and more open.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Choose soft neutrals like whites, creams, or pastels for your wall color.

  
– Opt for a light-colored sofa or chairs to complement the walls.

  
– Add colorful accents through pillows, throws, or artwork for contrast.

  
2. Incorporate Multi-Functional Furniture

  
In small living spaces, furniture that serves multiple purposes is a game-changer. Look for pieces that can be used in different ways, helping you maximize utility without overcrowding.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Choose a coffee table that opens up for storage.

  
– Invest in a sofa bed for guests or a futon for additional seating.

  
– Use ottomans instead of traditional seating that can double as storage.

  
3. Create an Open Layout

  
Keeping a visual flow throughout your small living room is crucial for creating the illusion of more space. An open layout allows for easier movement and a more expansive feel.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Arrange furniture to create a natural pathway.

  
– Avoid bulky, heavy pieces; select lightweight furniture that can be easily moved.

  
– Keep the center of the room open to facilitate movement.

  
4. Utilize Vertical Space

  
When floor space is limited, turn your eyes upwards! Utilizing vertical space not only helps keep the living room organized but also draws the eye upward, making the room feel taller.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Install shelves high on the walls to display books or decor.

  
– Use tall bookshelves that reach the ceiling.

  
– Hang artwork or mirrors higher than eye level to create the illusion of height.

  
5. Add Mirrors

  
Mirrors are a designer’s secret weapon when it comes to enhancing small spaces. They reflect light and can create the illusion of depth and dimension.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Hang a large mirror across from a window to reflect natural light.

  
– Use decorative mirrors in various shapes to add interest.

  
– Position mirrors behind lamps or on furniture to create depth.

  
6. Choose the Right Lighting

  
Good lighting is essential in a small living room. It not only illuminates the space but also sets the mood and makes the area feel more inviting.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Use layered lighting with a mixture of ambient, task, and accent lights.

  
– Choose sleek floor lamps or wall sconces to save floor space.

  
– Opt for dimmer switches to control the intensity of the light.

  
7. Create Zones with Rugs

  
Area rugs can define specific areas within a small living room, contributing to a structured yet inviting atmosphere. They help to separate spaces, making the room feel larger and more organized.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Place a rug under the main seating area to anchor the space.

  
– Use different rugs to indicate various functions, like a reading nook or play area.

  
– Choose rugs with light colors or patterns that don’t overwhelm the space.

  
8. Incorporate Natural Elements

  
Bringing the outside in can enhance your living room’s comfort. Natural elements like plants and wood can create a soothing and organic environment.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Add potted plants or hanging planters for a splash of greenery.

  
– Choose wooden furniture for warmth and texture.

  
– Use natural fabrics like cotton or linen for cushions and throws.

  
9. Keep it Clutter-Free

  
A cluttered room can quickly feel cramped and chaotic. Having a clean and organized living room will foster a cozy and spacious atmosphere.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Regularly declutter, removing items that no longer serve a purpose.

  
– Use decorative baskets or boxes for storage.

  
– Limit decorative items on surfaces to avoid a crowded look.

  
10. Use Floating Shelves

  
Floating shelves provide storage without taking up floor space. They are a stylish way to display books, photos, and collectibles while maintaining an open feel.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Install floating shelves above the sofa or in corners.

  
– Keep items arranged by color or size for a cohesive look.

  
– Avoid overcrowding shelves; leave some empty space for a clean appearance.

  
11. Opt for Transparent Furniture

  
Transparent furniture, like acrylic tables or glass chairs, creates a light and airy vibe, providing functionality without visual weight.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Choose a transparent coffee table to enhance flow.

  
– Incorporate ghost chairs around a dining table for versatility.

  
– Limit the use of heavy, solid pieces to avoid making the space feel cramped.

  
12. Use Built-In Storage Solutions

  
Built-in storage can beautifully maximize space and keep items organized while preventing clutter.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Create custom built-ins around the television for a cohesive look.

  
– Use shelving units that fit snugly into corners or walls.

  
– Consider window seats with storage underneath for a cozy nook.

  
13. Add Cozy Textiles

  
Soft textiles add warmth and comfort to your small living room. Think throw blankets, pillows, and textured rugs that invite relaxation.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Layer different textures, like a wool throw over a cotton couch.

  
– Mix and match throw pillows to create a cozy seating area.

  
– Utilize soft rugs underfoot to enhance comfort.

  
14. Embrace Minimalism

  
Sometimes, less is more. Adopting a minimalist approach can eliminate visual clutter and make a small living room feel more expansive and serene.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Limit decoration to essential pieces that bring you joy.

  
– Choose simple, functional furniture with clean lines.

  
– Create a cohesive color palette for a streamlined appearance.

  
15. Personalize with Artwork

  
Art can make a small living space feel unique and personal. Choosing the right pieces will add character without overwhelming the space.

  
How to achieve the look:

  
– Select a statement piece to hang above the sofa or fireplace.

  
– Use smaller framed pieces in a gallery wall to draw attention.

  
– Consider art that incorporates light colors to keep the room feeling open.

  
Conclusion

  
Transforming your small living room into a cozy and spacious haven is all about making thoughtful design choices. By incorporating light colors, multi-functional furniture, clever storage solutions, and personalized decor, you can create an inviting environment that feels both expansive and comfortable. Embrace these 15 small living room ideas to craft a space that reflects your style while ensuring a warm, welcoming, and spacious ambiance. Happy decorating!

Financial apps are different ball game. These apps keep client fund in the banks, which only insures them from BANK FAILURE, not app failure. 

Imagine a scenario where banking app fails for whatever reason (someone swindled them for a few million, they invested in wrong assets or whatever). Specially, in a scenario where these apps  fraudulently transferred money around and have a shortfall.

 I have heard a similar case happening in the US on CoffeeZilla. 

Following is what moneysavingexpert says about SideKick.

About FSCS protection for this account

Sidekick isn't a bank, so it uses Bondsmith to hold customer deposits in a ring-fenced account with OakNorth, so your money has the usual [£85,000 UK savings safety protection](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/safe-savings/). If Sidekick, Bondsmith or OakNorth Bank went bust, you'd get your money back (though it may take longer than if you had a direct relationship with the bank).

Any money held in your Sidekick Wallet is held in a ring-fenced bank account via the e-money and payments services provider Currencycloud. This bank account is with a major banking institution that Sidekick can't access. Although this means the funds in the Sidekick Wallet have a certain level of protection, we can't say how quickly you'd be able to get your money back if Sidekick went bust, so it's **probably not a good idea to keep a large sum of money in the Sidekick Wallet**. For safety, be sure to transfer all deposits and bonus interest into your OakNorth account (or elsewhere) – don't leave it in the Sidekick Wallet.

“We need to be crystal clear about what we want people to understand about us.”

Nail your core value in a single, punchy sentence.
 
Then hammer it home - over and over - until it feels like overkill. That’s when it finally sticks with others.

For example, if you’re a business pushing sustainable products, your line might be: “We make eco-friendly gear that lasts.”

Say it in your ads, your emails, your coffee shop chats. Consistency breeds recognition.

Early in my career a mentor told me, ""If you are sick of hearing yourself say the sane thing over and over, you are 10% done.""",11,1747311208.0,smallbusiness,4,0.76,False
