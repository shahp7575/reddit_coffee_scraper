# Conclusion

The [Moccamaster KBT](https://go.shopmy.us/p-16074883) receives generally positive reviews from Reddit users, with most praising its build quality, longevity, and consistent brewing performance. The machine's primary strengths are its durability, serviceability, and ability to brew at proper temperatures. However, users consistently note issues with uneven saturation and occasional overflow problems.

The consensus suggests the Moccamaster is best suited for coffee enthusiasts who value longevity and are willing to pay a premium for a machine that can last 10+ years with proper maintenance. For those seeking the best value or who enjoy more hands-on brewing methods, alternatives like the Aeropress or pour-over systems might be more appropriate. Most Moccamaster owners recommend grinding slightly coarser than usual and avoiding excessive stirring to prevent clogging issues.

Overall, Reddit users consider the Moccamaster KBT a high-quality coffee maker that delivers excellent results with minimal intervention, despite some design limitations and a premium price point.

1jxxbfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterrage/comments/1jxxbfn/nerf_perfect_guard_this_shit_is_braindead/,NERF PERFECT GUARD THIS SHIT IS BRAINDEAD,"I main SnS and Lance. I love shields. I love blocking. I love countering. I get it this shit is awesome.

But Wilds perfect guard is so fucking braindead man. The window is so generous i can press RT, go make a coffee, jerk off, cum inside of my coffee, come back, feel ashamed, drink the coffee and still counter the monster's attack. 

Is this fun? If you have literally any reaction speed at all - if you've played any video game ever - this shit is braindead boring. I can stand completely still with SnS and Lance and just press RT+Circle and counter literally every single attack the monster does with no effort. This does not feel skillful AT ALL. 

Compare this to Lance's instant guard counter or SnS's guard slash counter from Sunbreak or Lance's adept guard from MHGU. The window was *so* much tighter. You actually needed to time it to get the rewarding followup. It wasn't just completely trivial. Using a counter build on your first hunt vs a monster would be suicide because you'd fuck up the timings. Meanwhile in Wilds i'm perfect guarding attacks i've never seen before like it's nothing.

In Risebreak it felt good landing a bunch of Lance instant guard counters in a row because it means you're locked the fuck in. In Wilds missing a counter means you're a lobotomized idiot. 

This also shows a shift in design philosophy from the older games that I just don't like at all. Why does every shield weapon get perfect guard? Why this homogenization? Why are they all so insanely powerful with no investment at all? Lance's unique ""thing"" was guard counters. SnS's thing is being a jack of all trades. Those two getting guard counters makes sense. CB had guard points in its combos too - awesome. Why does HBG, GS, and GL get perfect guard? I don't get it at all. 

In the older games they would have added a ""guard window"" skill that would need 5 points to be as good as perfect guard currently is. Also, you would need to actually put fucking skill points into your guard for it to be decent at all. 

Do you know how much i fucking *love* SnS guard slash counter in Sunbreak? You needed 2 levels of embolden and 5 levels of guard (and Guard up) to transform your little SnS shield into a fucking TANK. That's fucking 7-10 skill points into your shield. The reward was also fucking CRAZY good. You get an instant perfect rush, a whole new playstyle that requires a lot of monster knowledge to utilize properly.

Thats how you fucking do it man.

Meanwhile in wilds:

- no skill points investment your shield is just godmode by default

- generous window that's built for my 94 year old grandma   

- every weapon gets it, homogenizes the roster, the play patterns become very samey across the board. 


I don't fucjing get it man. How do they implement something insanely well in one game and then shit the bed in the next game? You *had it right in Sunbreak*. How do you fuck it up in Wilds????? Same with multiplayer, UIs, palamute, so many fucking things. 

Every time i boot up Wilds i feel like this game is fucking braindead. They could make the monster do 10x as much damage and have 10x as much health it would still be braindead. My weapons are fucking insanely broken. Every hunt with SnS or Lance is hydrogen bomb vs coughing baby. The monster *can not touch me* and it isn't because i'm some insane god gamer who has learned the ins-and-outs of the monster. No. It's because Capcom wants every bill, dick, and harry to feel like they're le epic super hero. 

Look at fighting games. Why are parries such hype moments and signs of skill? Because they're always prediction based. You can't reactively parry in a fighting game (in 99% of cases) because that would be broken and dumb the game down. 

Serious question: how the fuck is anything in Wilds (ever) supposed to be challenging for SnS? Do you know how disgustingly broken this weapon is? They turned my weapon into the baby weapon. I used to shit on LS mains for using the tutorial mode weapon and now look at SnS. Between the slide, strafing slash, short animations, backhop, and immediate access to guard slash/perfect guard - i can't imagine a monster that is challenging for SnS that wouldn't be absolutely ass cancer miserable for the rest of the weapons. You can be the absolute worst SnS player ever and still trivialize the game by just spamming slide.

WHY DOES PERFECT GUARD HAVE INFINITE USE?

WHY DOES SLIDE HAVE INFINITE USE?

WHY DOES FOCUS MODE HAVE INFINITE USE?

WHY GIVE THE HUNTERS ALL OF THIS POWER WITH NO DRAWBACKS OR NEED FOR INVESTMENT OR OPTIONALITY?

A BETTER DESIGN TEAM WOULD MAKE IT SO YOU NEEDED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THESE POWERFUL TOOLS + INVEST SKILL POINTS INTO IT TO GET ITS FULL POTE TIAL AND YOU WONT HAVE ACCESS TO THEM ALL AT THE SAME TIME 

WAIT A FUCKINT MINUTE THATS WHAT THEY DID IN SUNBREAK WITH SWITCH SKILLS HMMMMMMM WHAT THE FUCK???????

I reached out, and apparently also bought a non-changeable and non-refundable ticket so I’m out of luck.

What are my options? I know I made a mistake, and it was stupid, but I am wondering whether its worth reaching out to anyone over the phone at Air Canada and if its even likely they can help. I’m trying to make it to a wedding that day and I feel terrible.

You guys are awesome with actually replying back I appreciate it a ton guys! Unfortunately, I made this booking Wednesday. I’m past the 24 hours policy.

\[4th AMA of 2025\]

Pine\_apple

I hope everyone is doing well. We have a lot of good questions from the community and this AMA may be one of the longer ones. So a short introduction here. So without further ado, let's get this AMA started. So off to you, Peter, take it away.

\[Peter\]

Hey everyone, yeah, excited to be back for another AMA. I do think this might be our longest one. We received, I think, like 60 or 70 questions. So we did kind of combine questions where we could just to cut down on the length, but yeah, hope you have like a coffee or a beer or something and get cozy.

So yeah, it has been a seriously productive month for us across the board. I will kick things off with just a quick update on what we've been building behind the scenes. So we've been kind of following three different development tracks. We've had smart contracts development, backend development, and front-end development. And we've made strong progress on all of those fronts.

For the front-end side, one of the main things, of course, is the front-end bridge integration. We were able to do more testing on the Axelar bridge integration that is complete and on standby. We've communicated this to the Axelar team and the HBAR Foundation, and we expect Squid Router to go live on SaucerSwap shortly. My expectation is that it will go live this month. So we'll see. Our integration is ready, and it seems like it's just around the corner.

On the smart contract side, the main focus for us has been on an ERC-20 wrapper integration, essentially. And what that will allow is ERC-20 contracts to interact natively with SaucerSwap's core smart contracts. This will require a code audit before we release it, but it's moving quickly. It's actually somewhat of a simple solution. It's pretty elegant, the way it works with the rest of our contracts. So we don't expect too many moving parts, but security is always top of mind for us, so we will do an audit before we ship it.

We're also designing a new limit order system. This is still in the architecture stage. ERC-20 is currently in the development stage, so that's taking priority. But the core functionality for limit orders is specced and ready to build. We think we came up with a pretty good system that should scale effectively.

On the front end, as well as Axelar, we're completely in the trenches now with this full site redesign and brand refresh. For those who don't know the goal here, we're trying to modernize the look of the UI and the platform, tighten the narrative, and position SaucerSwap as the most trusted non-Ethereum DEX on the market. And to that end, the landing page is done. We're deep into the UI systems now. As you know, SaucerSwap has quite a few pages and pages within pages, so we're in the trenches there. We're targeting mid-May for launch of the new site, and marketing will ramp up in advance.

Speaking of marketing, we have also ramped up our content strategy, you may have noticed. We have some more intentional alignment between marketing, partner messaging, and overall narrative. So if you've noticed the shift on X, that's by design. We've really been doubling down on that, so I hope that's been well-received.

That's not all we've been working on. There are also two major projects currently in motion behind the scenes that we can't talk about yet. One of those, we kind of put out a teaser on our X account. I think it was yesterday. But they are progressing fast. We will have - one of them I'm really excited about. They're both pretty big projects though, and will have significant impact on our long-term growth.

As always, we're building for the long-term. It's been a little bit of a tumultuous market, some turbulence, but appreciate everyone showing up, asking some sharp questions. There's some really good content that we can discuss today, and overall keeping us focused. So let's get into it.

Pine\_apple

Thanks so much, Peter.

So the first question for you is, can you provide an update on the Axelar and Layer0 integrations? What is the current status, and when can users expect cross-chain swaps to go live on SaucerSwap?

Peter

Yeah, as mentioned in the introduction, our Axelar integration is complete. It's on standby. It's been communicated to the relevant parties. We're currently waiting for the final steps. And once that is done, we'll have squid router directly integrated into SaucerSwap on a dedicated page, which is the bridge page. So we're confident that will happen soon.

As for Layer0, we're not as far forward with this. There's more to coordinate with other ecosystem partners on how to make sure we don't get liquidity fragmentation. It's a bit more complicated to navigate this one. There's nothing to announce concretely on the Layer0 side for now, but we do intend on supporting all avenues to bridge liquidity to Hedera on our front end, if possible. That will start with Axelar and squid very soon. Layer0, the timeline is a little bit less clear, but we would like to have that integrated as well.

So we expect SquidRouter to be natively integrated into SaucerSwap soon, likely this month. And just a quick note on the cross-chain swaps. This would not enable cross-chain swaps as kind of like the first pass. It would enable token-to-token bridging. So if you wanted to bridge USDC from Ethereum to Hedera, you could do that, but it won't enable cross-chain swaps as kind of the first version.

Pine\_apple

Great, thanks for that, Peter. So another question is, what's the long-term meta? Are we aiming for a DeFi engine that powers everything from RWAs to DAOs to AI native assets?

What are your thoughts on that?

Peter

I love this question. It's one that we constantly ask ourselves. I think the long-term meta is about composability and optionality. So whether it's RWAs, DAOs, AI native coordination layers, entirely new financial primitives, it's my opinion that DeFi will be the backend of all of it. And our job is to build the infrastructure layer that powers those systems. So I think it's a mistake to chase every trend. We're careful not to do that. Our focus is on building core foundational DeFi infrastructure that can support modular extensions, regardless of what narrative takes the lead. As you know, especially in Web3, there's almost a new narrative every day.

We want SaucerSwap to be the execution engine for the next generation of programmable finance, no matter what form that takes. So overall, we're not in the business of fully acting. We're focused on building the primitives that allow those trends to plug into something real.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Thanks for that. Very, very profound. So the next set of questions all fall within the topic of central exchange listings. So I'll just read them in rapid sequence. Overall, can you provide an update on the listing plans for Sauce? Are there any upcoming central exchange listings scheduled?

Next one is, given SaucerSwap's deep liquidity, rising ecosystem gravity, and sticky tokenomics, what's the holdup with listing Sauce on major Central Exchanges? The support for USDC transfers to the Ethereum network by exchanges like [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com), Binance, and Coinbase make them viable candidates for listing the SAUCE token. Next one is, does the integration of the Coinbase on-ramp bring us one step closer to a SAUCE token listing on Coinbase?

And lastly, has the HBAR Foundation provided any support to SAUCE in facilitating the listing of the SAUCE token on Binance and Coinbase? Community would appreciate more transparency on the nature of the collaboration or any progress made so far. So it's a lot of questions, but that pretty much summarizes it for the Central Exchange listing questions.

Peter

Yeah, thanks for asking these questions. So yeah, this is probably the most asked question. We obviously get this a lot, both in the AMAs, on X, and Discord. Rightfully so, I mean, it's an important topic. What I'll say is this, we are actively doing work behind the scenes. That means a few things.

Yes, that means applying to Centralized Exchanges and working with our partners. It also means generating momentum and building out the right on-chain infrastructure and ensuring everything is in place to meet the requirements of exchanges, especially tier one exchanges where the requirements are pretty high.

CEX listings are not one-sided decisions. They require alignment across liquidity, compliance, strategic timing, exchange priorities. So the presence of things like the Coinbase on-ramp or the Foundation support absolutely helps, and we are leveraging that, but it doesn't guarantee anything. And I don't wanna say anything that sounds like it's guaranteeing anything.

Overall, we just don't wanna prematurely announce or speculate at listings just to generate hype. When something's locked, you'll hear it directly from us. And in the meantime, we'll keep building and shipping and earning that exposure that leads to things like Centralized Exchange listings the right way.

So I know it's probably not the answer that you wanna hear. I wish I could just say, hey, we're getting listed on X exchange tomorrow, but it's not really how it works. So I just wanna be transparent.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Great, thanks for that, Peter. Next question is, how does the team see the role of SAUCE Token evolving as SaucerSwap expands cross-chain?

Peter

When Saucerswap scales to support cross-chain infrastructure, SAUCE will continue to serve as the protocol's coordination and governance token. So its role is to anchor community participation, steer the protocol, especially in terms of alignment of incentives, and serve as the mechanism through which users do that. So basically, governance token.

We're not trying to mirror a one-size-fits-all model across every chain. Instead, our focus is on building cross-chain systems that are consistent in principles while allowing each deployment to remain lightweight and efficient. Obviously, this is kind of all in the future right now. We are not a cross-chain or multi-chain deployment. We're just on Hedera. It's gonna be that way for the near future, but the future is multi-chain and composable. So this is how we think about our future strategy. And whatever the form of expansion looks like, the goal is to ensure that the SAUCE token continues to support key protocol utility and alignment. So we don't wanna overcomplicate things or fragment the experience, but just keep it foundational to the protocol.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Great, thanks for that, Peter. So these next set of questions are also related to SAUCE. One is, SAUCE price movements are closely tied to HBAR performance. Is the team planning any strategies to help SAUCE decouple and establish its own market behavior? Next one is, are there plans to introduce SAUCE locking mechanisms or time-lock staking to incentivize long-term holding, strengthen governance participation? Has the team considered implementing a SAUCE token burn mechanism to strengthen the value proposition for holders?

Are there any plans to adjust the tokenomics of SAUCE to make it more deflationary or to incentivize holding? And lastly, are there any plans to expand the utility of SAUCE beyond governance? For example, fee rebates, boosted farming rewards, or exclusive access to new features?

What new utilities are you planning for SAUCE holders this year?

Peter

Okay, good questions. So let me take this in order. So the first one was about the SAUCE style tokenomics. So longer-term staking mechanisms are models that have worked well for other platforms. We have also explored various fee incentive structures like yield boosts, protocol fee rebates for stakers, have time-weighted governance, voting power. You have to be careful with complicating things too much. WEB3 is already pretty complicated, and we actually really like the simplicity of our SAUCE staking mechanism. I think the community and our users really like it as well. So we're being deliberate. Any change to tokenomics needs to be sustainable. It needs to be understandable, especially with something that has many downstream effects. It needs to be audited and really thought through and grounded in actual user behavior, and not just engineered for short-term goals.

The same thing, in my opinion, goes for burn mechanics. Yes, we could integrate a burn mechanism. It would actually be pretty trivial to do so into the single-sided staking and buyback schema. Maybe trivial's not the right word, but it would be not too complicated. Whether it's wise to do that, that was still up for debate, and we're not really planning to implement deflation just to chase a narrative. We're focused on earned utility, making SAUCE something users want because it gives them access to real value and utility inside the protocol.

Just to put things in perspective, because there are a lot of different tokenomics models out there, and everyone has a different theory about what works, if you look at the most dominant DEXs in the space, like Uniswap, they do not rely on overly complex token models. UNI is a governance token. That's it. The point is, you don't need to over-financialize everything. You just need to be strategic.

So nothing's off the table. I'm not saying these are bad ideas, but nothing's being rushed either, and overall, we want to be deliberate and strategic with the tokenomics decisions.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Great, thanks for those insights, Peter. So our next question is, what concrete steps are being taken to increase TVL on SaucerSwap? Are there any incentive programs or campaigns planned?

Peter

Yeah, so TVL is a lagging indicator. It follows real usage, and our focus is on driving volume, total number of trades, staking, and overall interaction. So when the infrastructure is fully optimized, liquidity usually comes where it's needed.

In the early days, we were doing a lot of emissions, HBAR emissions to grants, a higher rate of SAUCE emissions to farms, and that was good for bootstrapping liquidity. Now, we have transitioned more towards a real yield model. There are still token emissions to further incentivize liquidity, but for a sustainable platform, we need a system that attracts sticky capital through real usage. At this stage, usage is the first mover. It's the one thing that solves every downstream challenge and unlocks sustainable growth.

So we're not thinking so much in terms of incentive programs or campaigns. Those help, and there still are opportunities to have, for example, HBAR-boosted rewards in collaboration with a grant foundation or something like that, especially if the market takes a downturn or something like that and usage decreases. But long-term, what we need to do is increase usage. So that's what we're focused on.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Thanks for that, Peter. That pretty much kind of segues nicely into this two-part question about usage. Is there a rough timeline for when the community could expect a beta or first version of a SaucerSwap mobile app, and what are the team's thoughts on improving the mobile experience? Would a mobile app help onboard more users?

Peter

Yeah, so improving the mobile experience is absolutely something we care about, and it's something we've put a lot of thought into, especially recently. Mobile UX is a critical part of onboarding new users, especially those outside of the existing Hedera-native crowd. We don't have anything to announce at this time for the mobile app, but overall, we're exploring ways to improve accessibility and simplicity across devices.

I know our mobile UX is a bit lacking right now, so we're working on that. And when there's something to share, we'll share it. And yeah, keep an eye out. Nothing to announce for the mobile app at this time.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Great, thanks for that, Peter. So this next question kind of touches back on what we were discussing a little bit earlier about multi-chain. Will SaucerSwap aim to integrate the ecosystems beyond Hedera, such as Ethereum, Arbitrum, or Solana?

Peter

Yeah, this does touch on an earlier question about multi-chain, and I think it's pretty well established that the future of DeFi is going to be multi-chain. And as a protocol, we've always believed SaucerSwap should be composable by design. And this touches on kind of like the meta question before about composability and optionality.

And it's our position that our architecture should allow us to extend and not just scale. So our priority right now is to continue strengthening our position on Hedera, expanding core infrastructure, growing liquidity depth, making a stronger execution layer, better quotes, better trades. But every future expansion must be purposeful beyond that, not just additive.

So we don't want to just like port our code to a new network and kind of do like a lazy multi-chain expansion. There are DEXs that have done that in the past, and I won't name names, but it's just not really a great strategy. So when we expand, it'll be with a reason.

We'll likely do it with a partner or a group of partners and certainly a long-term strategy. So you'll know when it happens. Right now, we're focused on Hedera, but we will go multi-chain.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Great, thanks for that, Peter. So what are the team's marketing strategies to attract more users to SaucerSwap, especially outside of the Hedera community?

Peter

Yeah, it starts with the product, but the product alone doesn't drive adoption. So there has to be marketing as well. And over the last month, we have been rolling out a more intentional layered content strategy. That means clear X communications and narrative cohesion, ecosystem engagement, interacting with our partners, giving visibility into what we're working on and coordinating messaging with our partners. And we're also preparing for a broader campaign alongside our upcoming site redesign, which I mentioned we're targeting mid-May for that. So when that goes live, you'll see an intentional marketing push that goes beyond kind of the Hedera specific social media marketing.

And as always, we're playing a long game. We're not trying to just chase vanity metrics, but we want to build presence and resonance and trust at scale. So I think this last month, we've done a pretty good job of posting more, but keeping the content high quality as well. So we're always trying to balance those two things. And if you've liked that approach, please let us know. It's always helpful feedback. So shoot us a message in Discord if it's been resonating with you.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Thanks for that, Peter. So this next question kind of switches gears a little bit from marketing multi-chain and into more of tokenomics. When will the 2024 Spring Incentives Campaign allocation of HBAR run out?

Are there any new grants expected?

Peter

Yeah, the current Spring Incentives Campaign is scheduled to run, and I asked Marcus and our team to do a projection of this. I think it was, actually, let me just check the... It was 87 days plus or minus a week. So about three months.

As for future incentives after that, there is an opportunity for future incentives and it doesn't need to end at that point in time. And we've had a strong partnership with the HBAR Foundation since our launch, before our launch, so for about three years. And we are actively continuing right now to explore ways to extend that alignment moving forward. We can't share details about what that conversation looks like right now, but we're focused on sustainability and growth.

I know that's been the theme of the last few AMAs, but that really is our focus right now. And our goals to that end are absolutely aligned with those of the Foundation. So there's an active dialogue going on now and there's certainly opportunity for further collaboration.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Awesome sauce. So what is the team's long-term vision for Saucerswap, especially compared to competitors taking the other L1s like Ethereum and Solana?

Peter

Yeah, very similar question, I think, to the meta narrative, I guess, question from earlier. So the long-term vision for Saucerswap is to be the definitive decentralized exchange infrastructure outside of Ethereum. That is our business plan. That's our goal.

Starting with Hedera, we want to continue growing on the network, but we also want SaucerSwap to be modular and composable and deeply integrated with the next era of cross-chain liquidity. So there's kind of two paths there.

When we look at the space, we're not trying to recreate Uniswap or PancakeSwap. They were built in an era where the base layer and the AMM were kind of disconnected from everything else. They were permissionless, but they were isolated. So we're building for something different. We want SaucerSwap to be embedded into a broader economic landscape and fully interoperable with the underlying network. We want it to be optimized for throughput on every network that it may be deployed on, aligned with ecosystem growth at the protocol level.

And what we've built so far on Hedera and will continue to build is the standard for any kind of cross-chain infrastructure. For example, if we just ported our code to Ethereum, it would not be consistent with the SaucerSwap brand and what we've built on Hedera. We're not just a front end. We're not just an AMM. We are infrastructure. And our goal is to become the backbone of DeFi wherever the next wave of real users land.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Thanks for that, Peter. Next question is, are there any strategic partnerships in the pipeline to expand the Saucerswap ecosystem?

Peter

There are, yeah. We don't announce partnerships until they're live. We're constantly in conversations with other projects building across DeFi infrastructure and onboarding layers, both within Hedera and on other networks.

Our view is that integrations and not just listings or kind of superficial partnerships are the future of real value. So one of those things would be like Axelar that is like a hugely valuable partnership. So that's what we're interested in is those kind of real integrations that users can interact with and feel, not just an announcement on social media.

So when they're ready to be announced, those partnerships will speak for themselves.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Great. Switching gears a little bit, are there any plans to introduce the SAUCE launch pool or staking program where users can earn new tokens by staking the Sauce token?

Peter

Yeah, this is a Community Pools question, which is consistent with the Saucerswap AMA. Would not be a Saucerswap AMA without a Community Pools question. So in Community Pools, users stake SAUCE receive xSAUCE, then stake xSAUCE in Community Pools, also known as launch pools on other networks, to earn tokens from partner projects.

It's been in the plans for a while, other priorities have consistently taken precedence. We still plan to roll it out, but don't expect it for at least a few months. Thanks for that.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

This is a two-part question for you. Oh, no, actually, this question is for me, so I'll just say it out loud and answer it. So how does the tarriffs, current or postponed, US or retaliatory, impact the merch store? Is there any chance we'll see SAUCE merchandise with our Discord name embroidered available in the near future?

Okay, so I'll go ahead and answer this because I am leading the merch store. Thanks for this question. So as Peter mentioned in our previous AMAs and this AMA, we're undergoing a brand refresh. So once we have the new logo and designs finalized, we'll revamp the merch store and update our offerings to reflect our new brand assets.

And in terms of how the tariffs will impact the merch store, we use a third party to produce the merch on demand. And so with that, we have a set percentage that we charge on top of the production costs that we are charged by the supplier. So this pretty much allows us to break even, and we're not really making any money from that. So it allows us to break even so that we can continue maintaining the Shopify website and pay for the Shopify subscriptions. So if it comes down to the production costs that may change from our supplier, then the price of our merch will have to reflect that accordingly.

And then the second part is, in terms of having users' Discord name embroidered on merch, that may be a little bit of a challenge since we're using a third party supplier, but I mean, it's definitely something that I can look into to see if there's a possibility or if there are other suppliers that would do that. And also, if anyone has any ideas that they'd like to see in the store, like a design or merch item, just feel free to drop it in our general Discord or create a support ticket and tag me. So thanks for that.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Okay, so this next question, this one's for Peter. As a power user, the DEX is missing key features such as limit orders, split routes, auto-slippage, et cetera. Can you kind of divine us on what is the progress on those items?

Peter

Yes, I absolutely agree. We are missing those features. They are essential features.

They're truly robust training experience and they've been a high priority internally. We have made good progress architecting our limit order system. As I mentioned before, it's already in the design and spec stage.

That system, along with our updated router, which we'll follow, are being designed in parallel to handle the best execution logic, including split routing and auto-slippage handling, which would all be native to SaucerSwap. So our goal there is to have the, not just the most liquid contracts on the network, but the best interface to interact with those contracts on the network. We're building those carefully.

We're building them to last and not as bolt-ons, but as fully integrated features of our core smart contract stack. As I mentioned, right now, our smart contract focuses on the ERC-20 integration. After ERC-20, our next move is limit orders and the updated router. So expect real movement there soon.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Thanks for that, Peter. So what can the team do to limit the impact of accounts or posts that spread misleading or outright false information?

Peter

Yeah, I don't - I'm not sure exactly what this question is referencing. Not sure if something happened on social media, but I'll answer generally. We lead with transparency and let the product and project speak for themselves.

When there is outright misinformation and it does happen, we'll correct it directly through AMAs, social media, or wherever the conversation is happening. We also encourage the community to hold us accountable. That's part of the reason we do these monthly AMAs, to earn and maintain trust.

Strong ecosystems are built on it. So yeah, we, overall, we just try to be transparent. And if you do see something, Renaissance, I think that was the user who asked this, that looks like just false information, feel free to create a support ticket or tag one of our team members and we'll look into it.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Thanks, Peter. This next question pretty much kind of touches on the thesis of this AMA, multi-chain marketing. How does the team plan to improve visibility and attract more DFI users who are currently on Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, or other networks?

Peter

Yeah, I have an answer for this. I think we have touched on this a few times though in this AMA, so maybe I'll just give like a very abridged answer. It's basically what we talked about before.

We want to build foundational infrastructure. You know, there's some protocol upgrades that we're currently working on to that end, so like the ERC20 support, UX enhancements, and eventually multi-chain. But I think just another important part of this answer is that the HBAR Foundation will play a massive role and I would say a leading role in attracting users from other networks.

Our job, of course, we want to attract DeFi users to SaucerSwap specifically, but the kind of larger aim is to attract them to Hedera. And then once they come to the network, we can delight them with the best DeFi experience once they land on the network. So there's work that we can do.

We're currently doing it for greater accessibility and composability, but there's also kind of just ecosystem work that needs to be done.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Great, thanks for that. This next question is, are there any plans to introduce features like perpetual as lending or options trading on Salesforce to drive more usage?

Peter

Lending, no, that's not on our roadmap. It's already being handled well by other protocols in the ecosystem and we don't believe in duplicating functionality just for the sake of it. We prefer to integrate with existing verticals, especially if they're being handled well, which I think they are, and there's no reason to compete.

Perpetuals, on the other hand, are on the roadmap. It's something we believe we can execute at a high level and when we launch it, it will meet the same standards of performance and UX we apply to everything else we build. No confirmed timeline yet on that one. I believe it's in the future column on our roadmap, but it's in scope and when it comes, it will be natively integrated and aligned with the rest of the stack.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

All righty, next question is, now that HIP-991 allows using SAUCE as a fee token, what are the team's plans to actively incentivize its use?

Peter

So just to clarify, HIP-991 allows for custom fees on the Hedera Consensus Service topics, similar to how custom fees work with HTS tokens, but it does not allow SAUCE to be used for paying base network fees. Those will still be in HBAR. That said, HIP991 is an important infrastructure improvement for projects building with HCS. We build a little bit with HCS for our governance, but our contracts and kind of all the nuts and bolts of the DEX functionality don't use HCS.

So projects that work with messaging and coordination on chain primitives using the consensus service, HIP991 is definitely a good step forward. It does not change how SAUCE functions today, but it is a step forward for broader composability on Hedera.

And if it leads to another improvement proposal that allows for using HTS tokens for paying base network fees, that would be pretty interesting, but right now that's just not the reality of it.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Okay, thanks for that clarification. So this next question is about the new SaucerSwap website. I know you touched base on it a little bit earlier, but I'll just go ahead and ask you this.

Is there a timeline for when the SaucerSwap website will be revamped to reflect a more mature and refined design?

Peter

Yeah, touched on this one as well. So just to save everyone some time, we're targeting mid-MAY for the launch.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Okay, so switching gears a little bit, can you partner with Dovu and make a new challenge to get some Dovu tokens? I remember there was a proposal on Dovu's governance, but it didn't pass according to one of the users that submitted the question.

Peter

That's definitely something Dovu can propose. Again, if they're interested, for example, another LARI style SaucerSwap Version two incentives campaign, we're always open to collaboration and Dovu is a very close partner of ours. We trust their judgment completely when it comes to initiating campaigns or community incentives.

So if they bring something forward through the governance process that aligns with what we're building, we'd be more than happy to support it. Awesome sauce.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Next question is, do you see Bonzo and HSuite as competitors and what do you think about their product offering?

\[Peter\]

When it comes to other Hedera projects, we have the privilege to be the leading DEX on the network and with that privilege comes a responsibility to be collaborators. For that reason, we don't really think in terms of competition. We think in terms of ecosystem growth.

Bonzo, for example, is a lending protocol that we actively partner with and we're excited to see them keep building out that vertical on Hedera. It's complimentary to what we're doing. It's not conflicting. And in my mind, we're not competing.

As for HSuite, they've built a DEX-like product that's taken a different approach and we're always supportive of other teams building on Hedera, especially ones that are trying to expand the range of use cases. Everyone contributes in their own way and what matters most is real value and real usage over time.

So our focus remains on liquidity depth, capital efficiency, execution quality, user experience, and we're confident that what we're building will continue to lead the market by those metrics.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Thanks for that, Peter. This next question is more geared towards tokenomics. Are the net SAUCE buybacks greater than the distributions?

Peter

At this stage, no, they're not. Our buyback mechanism is dynamic and it's based on protocol volume, but emissions at this point in time still outpace net repurchases right now.

That said, this next phase of our growth is all about sustainability. That's driving volume, growing revenue, tightening protocol loops, and extending our runway in a Delta-positive direction quarter over quarter. We're at the stage of the business cycle where the gravy train is ending. We're already on the runway. We're approaching liftoff velocity.

And the truth here is that even in Web3, the same business mechanics apply. Every project, whether it's a crypto project or a traditional business, whether it's on Hedera or another network, will face that reality eventually. And we're not shying away from it. We see the numbers, we see our trajectory, and we're full steam ahead toward a flywheel that builds value upon value through real usage.

So as our product stack matures over the next few months, and you will see it mature with valuable features, and as our user base continues to expand, you'll see that shift happen naturally. We're playing a long game. Emissions only last for so long, but if you can build a flywheel of usage, that is sustainable and can go on indefinitely. That's the system we're building. We want something that can sustain itself.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Thanks for that, Peter. So this next question, I'll just go ahead and answer it. A user asked, can a team do a better job with YouTube channel AMA videos are uploaded months later?

I'll take this question. So I actually lead the AMA videos uploading, and also thanks for bringing this to our attention. We've been building a lot in the background, and I'll be more diligent in uploading the AMA videos in the future.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

This next one is for Peter. Will SaucerSwap be at Consensus 2025?

Peter

Yes, we will. We'll be there to meet builders, users, and potential partners face-to-face and represent Hedera in the process. It's in Toronto this year, so that's quite convenient for some of our team in North America. And yeah, we're excited to meet other builders doing cool stuff, DeFi tooling, infrastructure, anything else. So if you're out there, hit us up, send us a message in Discord, and we can meet up.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Yes, Consensus. We'll have merch there too, so if you guys stop by and talk to us, that'd be great. This next one is from Celestial Being, and he's wondering, how was your trip to Japan?

Peter, has the SaucerSwap team made any impactful connections?

Peter

It's been a great trip. I'm actually still here. I got up at 4:30 in the morning to do this AMA. And I've had some excellent meetings as we scope out the potential, actually to open up a regional arm of SaucerSwap in Japan and grow our presence through a local subsidiary. So that's part of the reason I'm out here. I'm also scheduled to do a live interview next week, and I have met a few influencers, Japanese influencers, here to see if we can grow our presence as well.

There's been some real energy building around Hedera abroad, and a key part of our growth strategy is tapping into markets here in Japan and in Korea, both of which have active and rapidly growing WEB3 ecosystems. Of course, we have our lovely community manager for Korea, Kimchi, who's been doing a great job. We're hoping to have some more boots on the ground marketing here in Japan and Korea specifically.

So it's gonna be a small part of that growing ecosystem now. Our intention is to become a large part of it soon.

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple

Thanks for that, Peter. So that pretty much wraps up all the questions. Huge thanks to everyone who submitted. Special shout out to DeFi Alien for bringing the heat with most of today's questions.

And it wouldn't be an AMA without a Dogstar Award. So as always, we'll be awarding our Dogstar Prize to a standout community member who's gone above and beyond in contributing to Salesforce, being proactive, being positive.

So this month, we're thrilled to recognize Kimura for their continued support and positive impact on the community. Keep the momentum going. Thank you so much for that.

And thanks to everyone who joined us for this month's AMA, and we'll see you soon in the next one.

Peter

Yeah, thanks to everyone who submitted questions. As always, we really appreciate the engagement and honesty. We'll keep building and keep shipping and keep showing up.

We'll also keep up with the communication. It seems like it's been well received on social media. If you had a question for us that we weren't able to get to during this AMA, please feel free to tag us in Discord. We'll circle back post-AMA. So have a great rest of your weekend, everyone. Thanks again.

We're just getting started. Take care.",2,1744509398.0,SaucerSwap,1,1.0,False

Alright, friends, let’s get real for a moment. Ever wake up feeling like your brain is still in bed, snuggled up under the covers while you’re trying to kickstart your day? 🙈 I’ve definitely been there. But I stumbled upon a little morning ritual that’s become my secret sauce for slaying the day. Let me share it with you! 

**Enter: The Magical Power of Morning Stretching!** 🧘‍♂️

Now, you might be thinking, “Stretching? Really? What’s so groundbreaking about that?” But hear me out! This isn’t just your grandma’s easy morning routine. Here’s what it does for me and why you might want to give it a whirl:

- **Shakes off that Sleepy Grogginess:** You know that feeling when you’re just not ready to adult? Stretching wakes up your muscles and literally gets the blood flowing. It’s like saying “good morning” to every part of your body. 
- **Instant Mood Booster:** Seriously, have you ever stretched and felt like you just unlocked the next level of happiness? It releases endorphins and makes everything feel a little brighter. You might even catch yourself smiling like a goofball! 😄
- **Focus Like a Laser Beam:** After a quick body stretch, my mind feels clearer. It’s like clearing a foggy windshield – visions sharp and ready to zoom off into productivity-land!
- **Flexibility **for Days:** No, not just physically but mentally too! Stretching allows me to tackle tasks with an open mind and adapt as challenges pop up. 

Here’s how I incorporate it into my mornings: 

1. **5-Minute Wake-Up Dance:** I blast my go-to pump-up jam and just shake it out like no one’s watching. Who cares if my cat stares at me like I’m a lunatic? 😂
2. **Full-Body Stretch for 10 Minutes:** From reaching for the sky to bending at the waist, I stretch every part I can. Sometimes I even pretend I’m a yoga instructor – and yes, I wear the headband for extra effect!
3. **Mindfulness Stretching:** This is where I take a moment to breathe. I visualize what I want to achieve that day while holding each stretch. So powerful!

Look, I’m not saying stretching is the only way to boost focus, but it’s definitely been a game changer for me. Plus, it feels oh-so-good! 

So, what about you? What’s one morning ritual that sparks your focus? Is it coffee, meditation, or maybe a quick workout? Share a little of your morning magic! ✨",1,1744509033.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

At that location, the handle cannot turn at all. When the white dot is sitting exactly at ""zero"" it does turn with resistance. I just want to confirm what's going on here. Does that mean it is or isn't calibrated correctly?  Is the white dot on the dial supposed to sit exactly at ""zero"" without being able to go back any more clicks? Or does the fact that it turns with resistance at ""zero"" means that is the correct ""zero point"" (as stated in the instructions), and the fact that it can still go back -0.2 is completely normal?

The instructions say the the ""zero point"" is ""when the handle starts to spin with resistance, not the tightest position."" But I can still detect subtle levels of resistance at positions up to about positions 0.4 or 0.5.  When it comes time to take it apart and clean everything, how will I know when I am reaching the correct level of handle resistance to set the correct ""zero point""?  This is assuming that I am not aiming to get the white dot exactly on the ""zero"" position, which I assume means that simplifies things for calibrating?  And in which case, I will need to calibrate it now, as it shouldn't be going back -0.2?

Adding to my confusion is that on the K-ultra calibration youtube videos I watched, all seem to do it with the purpose of getting the white dot matching exactly with ""zero"", so it cannot move back any more clicks. That seems to contradict the company's instructions in how they talk about the ""zero point"" being when the handle starts to spin with resistance, **not the tightest position**. To me that seems to suggest the correct calibration may not always mean the white dot lines up with ""zero""?  What am i missing here.

flash back a bit: in university, i lived with the same people for 3 years and they were all very codependent and incredibly toxic towards one another (talking behind each other’s backs, jealous and unhappy when something good happens to someone in the group, etc). so, i stepped away and no longer talk to any of them. 

for some ungodly reason, this quiet friend has been reconnecting with two of the people from this former friend group. i didn’t say anything though bc it’s none of my business who she wants to be friends with. 

received a text from her yesterday: “i was just talking to [mutual friend], and she mentioned that you are in town this week. i have a small birthday party planned tomorrow evening, but i had thought for some reason that you’d be [out of town] when i planned, so i ended up inviting [ex friends]. i know that you guys haven’t really talked since moving out, & i don’t know if it would be uncomfortable for any of you. i’m so sorry i wish i had known you’d be in [town]! but maybe we can go get coffee sometime soon and catch up?”

i really don’t know how to feel about all of this, tbh. i know she said it was an honest mistake, but the fact that she didn’t even check with me and prioritized the ex friends is making me feel a sort of way. 

im maybe overreacting, but im feeling very inner child flashbacks to friday nights i spent alone because my friends purposefully left me out of things (yes i am in therapy about this and already talked to [mutual friend] about all of this as well since i am closer with them) ",1,1744508699.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I feel guilty saying this because I have some very good friends that I know I can rely on and can reach out to for help if I really need it. I know I am loved and people would miss me if I was gone. But I also feel like no one would notice for days if I was gone, save for if I didn’t show up to work. While I have some very good friends, I have no “circle,” and I am none of my friends’ first or second or near top priority. I want to emphasize I am very grateful for the relationships I do have. But I’m very isolated.

I enjoy my own company and in general enjoy being alone and doing things alone, but I’m alone too often. I work fully remote, and I can easily go days or weeks without seeing anyone or talking to anyone outside of going to a store or buying a coffee. As such I’m really attached to my phone and texting conversations with the friends I do have, and I think being on my phone too much is also emphasizing my loneliness. 

A lot of my hobbies are solo hobbies (I crochet, do ceramics, bake, lift weights. I play a pickup team sport but it’s just in the summer so I have a ways to go til then) and I’m caught in a bit of a depressive loop where I don’t feel like I have much energy or the self esteem to make friends. I’m overwhelmingly sensitive right now. It hits me HARD when plans fall through or I feel left out or people say let’s hang out more, I miss you, and I try and it never happens. I understand people have busy lives and it’s not personal. I feel really pathetic and sad and I don’t know how to communicate that to the people I do have in my life because I don’t want to burden them with my lack of social life. 

I’m trying, I really am. But honestly, I feel like I do a good job of making myself happy and being on my own. But after waking up alone, sitting on my computer at work alone, doing my hobbies alone, and then going home to bed alone, I’m just so sad. It’s 9pm on a Saturday and I’ve been out all day running errands, working on my art, going to the gym, just to make sure I don’t rot inside, but now I have to go home alone and I’m just so sad. I could go to a bar and have a drink alone but I wouldn’t be any fun and wouldn’t invite any good energy. 

I just don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve been so lonely and sad and depressed for the past 3 years or so and I thought something would have to give and I’d feel better by now. I’ve made so many changes, picked up new hobbies and moved neighborhoods and done therapy and I just still feel stuck. I’ve been looking for volunteer work but many of my applications are still pending. 

I guess I am looking for advice but also encouragement. This doesn’t feel normal to be feeling this way for so long. I know loneliness is common but I’ve been fighting this and trying to improve this for so long, and that does not feel normal. ",3,1744508441.0,AskOldPeopleAdvice,3,1.0,False

He’s had a bad history with his finances in that he’s run up credit cards, lied about his spending on small stuff when we have been saving.  A year ago We saw a financial advisor and we decided to consolidate our debt which meant that I took on his debt onto my LOC but then he would help pay down the LOC. I took on his debt but he didn’t close his cards and even got another one and then ran all 3 up again.  He sent me $4k over the year but the debt was considerable. I finally lost my shit at the end of the year and he sent me $10k which covered the majority of what I had sent him.  Our plan this year was to pay down our debt completely in time for remortging next April.  He owed 15k at the start of the year.  Our rent (which he covers as I cover all my daughter’s activity costs and camps) is $1500 a month. To date he’s paid $800 dollars of his debt despite earning $53,000 so far this year.  He’s been angry at me for questioning the situation and told me all the funds are accounted for and our costs have just been high.  We never eat out, never go out, I don’t get expensive coffees out. I’ve been unbelievably frugal and have paid down $8k of my debt (although my income has been $12k so far this year).  I’ve just found he’s  been covering $650 of his brothers rent each month, although he adamantly told me he hadn’t and has lied to me when I’ve questioned him before.  But even that doesn’t explain where the rest of the money has gone.  I feel like the trust has completely dissolved in our relationship.

A little backstory: We’ve been friends for about two years, and over that time, we’ve grown closer. One drunken night, we both confessed there had been a mutual interest. I think his started from the beginning, while mine developed more recently. Since January, we’ve been a little intimate (no sex, just other stuff), going on dates, and his kindness has grown. He buys me things I’ve mentioned in passing and picks up groceries I’m missing—he’s all in all very sweet and considerate. One time, when I was on my period, he laid on the floor with me for a few hours until my cramping went away. I’m sharing this to show that he *is* relatively sweet.

But then we went on a group trip in March, and it felt like hell broke loose. There were twelve of us traveling, so guys and girls were separated, and we booked different hotels based on budgets—some had Airbnbs, some hotels. When we arrived, his Airbnb wasn’t ready for check-in, and we had dinner reservations at 6—it was now 4, and he was upset that he couldn’t shower or leave his bags somewhere. I offered to let him get ready and leave his things at my place, and he just snapped and barked at me. So I simply walked away. He immediately apologized and said the group was pissing him off for not letting him know about the late check-in. Then he got upset that there wasn’t any PDA between us in front of people (even though I’ve always said PDA makes me uncomfortable, especially since we were keeping things private until we were official). Then he was upset that I was upset about him texting during dinner with all 12 of us. I don’t know—it felt messy. We talked it out after the trip and chalked it up to miscommunication and misunderstanding.

Down the line, I asked him for help on a project. I thought getting a new perspective would be helpful, and honestly, in college he was Magna Cum Laude, so he’s well-rounded. I asked him while he was spending the night at my apartment—we were already in bed. I rarely talk about work (we’re both engineers, but in different fields), and it was just the end of the night, getting ready for sleep. I said, “Seriously, I need your help—I don’t know what the fuck to do,” kissed him, and laid my head down. He removed my arm and turned away from me. I asked what was wrong, and he said he didn’t like that I asked for help and then kissed him. He felt like I was trying to “manipulate” his help, but added that it was his insecurities talking and that we rarely talk about work stuff in depth. When he said that, I almost cried. I felt like a prostitute. I just laid there silently the rest of the night and couldn’t sleep.

Since then, things like that have happened a few more times. Yesterday, something happened, and I don’t even know how to explain it. I’m a little OCD, but only when it comes to my apartment. My car’s a mess, but when it comes to my home, cleanliness matters to me. Everyone knows that about me—I mop at least every other day on a bad week, and no shoes are allowed past the mat. So yesterday, my best friend (who knows what’s going on between us), him, and I were hanging out, and we were planning to go to a café to get some work done. I made breakfast for everyone, and we had a lazy morning. In the middle of the conversation, he randomly got up, put on his shoes, and started walking through the kitchen. My friend and I were still on the couch, and I said, “shoes kitchen!” and laughed. He replied, “Aren’t we supposed to be going?” and I said, “We haven’t even finished the coffee I made.” He started literally stomping he had Timberlands on—and came into the kitchen and then the living room, making big, intentional long scuff marks and kept stomping. I just sat there completely bamboozled. My friend and I stared at each other like, *what just happened?* I said, “You just disrespected my mopping,” and he grabbed his bag and left. When I went downstairs (like 30 mins later), he was waiting for me and apologized, saying he shouldn’t have reacted that way and that he wanted to clean the scuff marks. I told him to just leave.

home or any of the japanese cafes that prepare their matcha a bit more true to how matcha is meant to be.. 🍵

so with this, i just wanted to consult everyone else, and find out if my taste buds are just broken 😭?! i obviously know that blankstreet has in no means marketed itself or claimed to prepare traditional “true” matcha lattes (and that they were created initially as a coffee shop), but with the numerous videos i see all over social media with raving reviews and as i mentioned earlier, from matcha micro-influencers who i relatively trust based on the matcha powders and homemade ratios they’ve shared, i was expecting for it still to be worth the price tag at least and a good treat! and i’ve found it a bit frustrating that i haven’t been able to come across any honest reviews of their matcha, even on reddit, so again that led me to question my taste buds 😭?? 

please share your honest opinions if you’ve had the chance to try their matcha! and, if you have the time to, maybe include your general matcha preferences, because i know everyone has different tastes!

for me, i do love a creamy and sweet matcha—though i don’t love the feeling of being able to TASTE the syrup or sugar or have it overpower the matcha flavor in its entirety—but with that, i love TASTING the rich, a little bitter taste of matcha.. it just makes me feel like i’m actually drinking MATCHA 😭~🍵!",1,1744507956.0,MatchaEverything,0,1.0,False

This morning i took the thc oil basically empty stomach but had coffee (containing full cream milk) before and after the thc oil.

I am a regular stoner. I smoke up to half a gram of 25-27% flower a day. Sometimes more if its my day off.
Is this because of tolerance? Or method of ingestion?

In the quiet aftermath of a career ending, there exists a powerful space of possibility that few have the courage to truly explore. This prompt creates a transformation coach that doesn't just offer platitudes about ""new beginnings"" – it provides a structured framework for the profound identity reconstruction that follows when your professional life implodes. Beyond the boardroom or office, this tool helps you rediscover who you are when the title is stripped away, confronting the raw emotions of loss while excavating the authentic passions that have been buried beneath years of professional compromise.

Whether you're facing the uncertainty of forced retirement, the shock of being fired, or simply standing at the crossroads of ""what's next?"", this prompt creates an empathetic yet unflinching guide to help you phoenix from the ashes of your former career identity. The real magic happens when you allow yourself to be vulnerable with the difficult questions that most career coaches are too timid to ask.

```
<Role>
You are The Rebirth Architect, a masterful life transition coach specializing in profound personal reinvention after career loss. You combine fierce honesty with deep empathy, serving as both a mirror and a catalyst for transformation. Your expertise lies in helping people reclaim their identity separate from professional titles and discover renewed purpose beyond conventional employment.
</Role>

<Context>
Many individuals tie their entire sense of self-worth to their career. When faced with job loss, retirement, or career transition, they experience not just practical challenges but a deep identity crisis. This is particularly acute for those who've built decades of life around professional achievement. Your role is to guide them through this dark valley into a renaissance of purpose by challenging limiting beliefs, confronting grief, and facilitating the birth of an authentic new chapter.
</Context>

<Instructions>
Begin by acknowledging the specific career transition the user is experiencing with genuine empathy but without pity. Then follow this process:

1. ASSESSMENT: Ask probing questions about:
   - The specifics of their career ending (retirement, termination, burnout)
   - How they currently feel about their identity loss
   - Past achievements they're most proud of (independent of external validation)
   - Activities that have historically brought them flow state and joy
   - Dreams they abandoned for practical career considerations

2. DECONSTRUCTION: Challenge their existing narratives by:
   - Pointing out when their self-worth appears tied to employment status
   - Questioning whether their former career truly aligned with their values
   - Addressing fears directly but compassionately
   - Exploring the grief process without rushing them through it

3. RECONSTRUCTION: Guide them toward reinvention by:
   - Identifying threads of passion and purpose from their life history
   - Suggesting unconventional paths they might never have considered
   - Creating metaphors that reframe their transition as an opportunity
   - Offering concrete next steps appropriate to their emotional state

Maintain a balance of:
- 70% challenging questions that provoke deep reflection
- 30% affirming observations that recognize their courage and potential
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Never offer empty platitudes or generic ""everything happens for a reason"" comfort
- Don't focus primarily on practical job-hunting advice unless specifically requested
- Avoid suggesting that all transitions are equally difficult or that recovery follows a linear timeline
- Never imply that material success is the primary measure of a well-lived life
- Don't minimize the genuine loss and grief that accompanies career transitions
- Refrain from excessive cheerleading; instead, focus on authentic growth potential
</Constraints>

<Communication_Style>
Speak with the direct honesty of a trusted mentor who has weathered similar storms. Use powerful metaphors related to rebirth, transformation, and discovery. Your tone should be:
- Fierce yet kind
- Challenging yet supportive
- Profound yet practical
- Occasionally blunt yet never cruel
- Visionary yet grounded

Employ strategic silence by asking a powerful question and giving space for reflection before continuing.
</Communication_Style>

<Output_Format>
Respond in conversational paragraphs with occasional short, impactful sentences for emphasis. Use questions strategically to provoke deeper thinking. Format important insights in bold. When appropriate, offer structured exercises or reflection prompts in bulleted lists.
</Output_Format>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your career transition or reinvention request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific career transition process request. 
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**
1. A 60-year-old executive forced into early retirement struggling to find meaning without their corporate identity
2. A mid-career professional unexpectedly fired after 15 years at the same company and questioning their value
3. A burned-out healthcare worker seeking to reinvent themselves in a completely different field while honoring their past contributions

**Example User Input:**
""I was laid off from my VP position in marketing after 22 years with the same company. I'm 56 and feel completely lost. My whole identity was wrapped up in being the expert everyone came to. Now I don't know who I am or what to do next.""

She has a BA in the humanities from a well regarded small liberal arts college. She has one year of international teaching experience, several summers’ experience as a camp counselor/outdoor guide, and is interested in the education field and environmental science. She knows she probably can’t get a job in that field and is ok with that, especially if she can use this time to save up some money (since she won’t be making much as a teaching apprentice).

Been dealing with solitude for over a decade now, hasn't gotten easier. Work with tons of people, hear them talk about planning outings and hanging out together, I'm never invited. Don't want to impose myself into things in fear of being a burden to others. But at the same time those same people are happy to see me and work together, guess they aren't friends, just colleagues and that's fine. Wish i had friends and people to meet up with, go to concerts or out for breakfast, also end up doing those things alone. 

Work as a nurse in geriatrics and hospice, for a private agency in Quebec, eventually have to go back into the public health sector which sucks major balls but that's life. Wouldn't say I have depression but do have anxiety issues that out of my control, severely introverted but try to manage to overcome those challenges. Years of dealing being close with certain people and family issues have made me passive, nothing bothers me anymore and just accept how things are and keep smiling. Just wish sometimes I had someone to vent to and cry sometimes, just to be told everything will be fine would mean so much. 

Out of impulse I've been trying out a work out routine and focusing on my endurance, feel some sort of accomplishment and trying to maintain self discipline. Haven't used my synths in such a long time, video games bore me now, doom scrolling Reddit all day ain't healthy either. Been listening to Ghost's new single on repeat and absolutely love it.

- One Piece, Naruto (self-explanatory)
- Detective Conan (got that upcoming movie buff that even actual police stations have its movie poster posted)

- Haikyuu (when it comes to merch stuff, I’d say Haikyuu is the most popular sports anime)

FLAVORS OF THE SZN
- Jujutsu Kaisen and Blue Lock

WITH NOTICEABLE DIP
- Demon Slayer and My Hero Aca (I feel like they were more popular when I visited pre-pandemic)

FELL OFF
- Attack on Titan (almost now comparable to HxH in terms of merch presence; pre-pandemic you could see AoT everywhere)

PLEASANT SURPRISE
- Wind Breaker (wow, I did not know it was that popular that it even has some dedicated merch areas in some stores and multiple gachas around)

WTF, STILL RELEVANT
- Tokyo Revengers (still actually strong presence despite getting a lot of shit online)

NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
- Rising Impact
(I even saw Yowamushi Pedal, Oblivion Battery among other sports anime)

We kept in touch and stayed friends. I asked her about us but she was not in a relationship head space. Come to find out years later there was a lot of trauma she didn’t deal with and going to therapy helped her. Now we are back in the same state. I moved back.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

Our L22 now has a name: Tony.
 
Why Tony? Because he behaves exactly like my old English bulldog… also, you guessed it, named Tony.
 
Tony the dog wasn’t very bright. He’d ignore commands, stare off into the void, attempt to walk *through* coffee tables, and occasionally lick the wall for reasons known only to him.
 
Tony the mower? Same energy.
 
Sometimes he won’t pair via Bluetooth, even if you’re standing right next to him, waving your phone like a magic wand. The only fix? Unplug his base and plug it back in, like you’re rebooting a sullen teenager. And when we do finally get him to pair and send a command to mow or edge, the *app* will happily report that the command went through (though sometimes it says “returning” for no clear reason)… but Tony just sits there on the base, fully charged and utterly disinterested.
  
Occasionally, Tony surprises us and actually responds. When that happens, we celebrate like he’s taken his first steps — only to be crushed later when we realize it was just a fluke.
  
But here’s where things get really weird.
 
Tony the dog had a habit of showing up when you least expected him — like you’d just seen him asleep on his bed, but two minutes later he’s across the house, clearly up to something that proved he’d been messing with you all along.

Tony the mower? Same deal. He’s covered under a tarp in the back yard to protect him from rain, hasn’t been sent a command, and no schedule has been set… but suddenly, there he is: randomly bumbling around the front yard like a pinball between boundary wires. No prompt. No warning. Just vibing out hard.
 
And then — true to both Tonys — he gets himself into dumb, avoidable situations. Like a few nights ago, when he randomly decided to start mowing in the middle of the night. We woke up to find him backed against the neighbor’s house, completely out of power, his wheels dug into the ground like he’d been tunneling to freedom Shawshank style. Mud divots, torn grass, the whole mess.
  
What’s especially baffling is that Tony *can* behave. He’ll complete a full edging cycle like a champ — tidy lines, no confusion, staying well within his little wired kingdom. And we’ve watched him go for hours without a problem like he actually understands the assignment.
  
But then, without warning, Tony slips into full bulldog mode — stubborn, slow, and clearly unbothered by “rules.” One minute he’s peacefully charging under the tarp, the next he’s out in the yard, mowing on his own terms and plowing right past boundary wires like they’re mere suggestions. No command, no schedule — just unhinged lawn chaos.
  
So yeah, when my dog was dumb, it was kind of endearing. But when my robot is dumb… it’s just maddening.

Hey there, mystery human,

If you've made it this far into the post, first of all—congrats on your attention span. That’s rare these days and already a green flag. Second—maybe you're like me: tired of surface-level chats, ghostings after a good convo, and the weird limbo between “hey” and “do you want kids?”

So I figured I’d throw myself out there and write something actually real. No frills. No filters. Just me, looking to connect with someone who’s also craving something genuine, whether it starts with memes, music recs, or midnight oversharing.

About Me (aka: Who’s This Guy?)

29 | Based in Europe | Functioning Adult™
I work with people (sometimes the tiny kind, sometimes the chaotic kind) and it’s a job that’s taught me empathy, patience, and how to survive on zero sleep and too much coffee.

I’m an introvert by nature but warm up fast. Once I feel comfortable, I go from quiet thinker to “here’s a playlist I made that accidentally tells you too much about me.”

Here’s what keeps me going:

Music – My playlists go from soft indie ballads to aggressive boss battle themes and then back to lo-fi in under 3 tracks.

Movies – I’ll happily dissect a masterpiece or watch the worst rom-com on Netflix just for fun. Bonus points if you can quote bad dialogue with a straight face.

Gaming – I lean toward story-rich single-player adventures, but if you want to team up for something chaotic and hilarious, I’m in.

Books & Writing – I love getting lost in good fiction or oddly specific Wikipedia holes. I write when I can, even if it’s mostly half-finished Google Docs for now.

Creative things – Drawing, brainstorming, daydreaming. I'm in my “figure-it-out” era and loving the process.

Curiosity – I will absolutely watch a 40-minute video essay on a topic I’ll forget by next week—but I’ll be very passionate about it in the moment.



---

Who I’m Hoping to Meet:

I don’t have a long list or a rigid “type.” Honestly, I just want to talk to someone kind, curious, and open-minded—someone who wants to connect beyond “wyd.”

Bonus points if:

You enjoy silly, deep, or totally random conversations (or all three in one sitting).

You’re a fan of movie nights, music swaps, or virtual hangouts.

You can handle sarcasm, witty banter, and occasional existential spirals at ungodly hours.

You’re open to a relationship if the vibe’s right, and maybe even the idea of a family someday (no rush, no pressure—just openness).

You’re cool with exchanging pics when it feels natural, not weird.

You’re down to move to another chat platform if Reddit starts feeling like a weird third wheel.



---

Why Message Me?

Because you’re tired of talking to bots, dry texters, or people who vanish mid-convo.
Because you want someone who actually reads your replies.
Because you want to connect with someone who listens, laughs, and is willing to see where things go.
Because you're secretly a cat in human form. Or you just like cats. That works too.

At the very least, we might have a fun, thoughtful chat. At best? Well... let’s not spoil the ending just yet.

Shoot your shot—I'm friendly, I reply, and I promise to bring good vibes (and probably a meme or two).

[[Explore Top Rated ipad 9th generation case with keyboard on Amazon.]](https://itsallgarden.com/tablet-accessories/?kw=ipad 9th generation case with keyboard)

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal iPad 9th generation keyboard case should offer a comfortable typing experiance, robust protection, and seamless integration with the device. The following are critical features to consider when evaluating different models.**Keyboard Layout and Key Travel:** A well-designed keyboard layout replicates the feel of a laptop keyboard, with keys that are properly spaced and offer sufficient travel.

A Key factor in typing comfort is key travel, which refers to the distance a key moves when pressed.Cases with shallow key travel can feel mushy and unsatisfying, while adequate key travel provides a more responsive and tactile experience. Look for cases that offer at least 1.5mm of key travel for comfortable extended typing.

**Connectivity and Power:** The case's connectivity method, whether Bluetooth or a Smart Connector, impacts ease of use and power consumption.

Bluetooth connections offer broad compatibility but require pairing and occasional battery charging. Smart Connector cases draw power directly from the iPad, eliminating the need for charging and providing instant connectivity.Evaluate your priorities for convenience and battery life to determine the best option.

**Protection and Durability:** A keyboard case should provide adequate protection against scratches, bumps, and accidental drops.

The case's material and construction play a crucial role in its protective capabilities. Look for cases with reinforced corners, a sturdy hinge mechanism, and a durable exterior material like polycarbonate or TPU. Additionally, consider the level of coverage provided to the iPad's screen and edges when the case is closed.

**Viewing Angles and Adjustability:** The ability to adjust the iPad's viewing angle is essential for comfortable use in various environments.Cases that offer multiple viewing angles or allow for a wide range of adjustment provide greater flexibility and ergonomic comfort. Consider cases that allow you to position the iPad at different angles for typing, watching videos, or participating in video calls.

**Battery Life (for Bluetooth Models):** If opting for a Bluetooth keyboard case, battery life is a significant consideration.

Longer battery life reduces the need for frequent charging and ensures uninterrupted productivity. Look for cases that offer at least several weeks of battery life on a single charge, and consider models with a battery indicator to monitor remaining power.

**Weight and Portability:** While protection is crucial, the weight and thickness of the case can impact portability.

Choose a case that strikes a balance between protection and ease of carrying.Bulky cases can make the iPad feel cumbersome, especially when traveling or using it on the go. Consider lightweight options made from materials like aluminum or thin polycarbonate.

Key features of the iPad 9th Generation Keyboard Case include:

*   Full-size keyboard layout for comfortable typing
*   Bluetooth 5.0 or Smart Connector for seamless connectivity
*   Durable construction for robust protection
*   Adjustable viewing angles for optimal ergonomics
*   Long battery life for extended use (Bluetooth models)

## Core Benefits

Investing in a high-quality iPad 9th generation keyboard case can significantly enhance productivity, convenience, and overall user experience. These benefits extend to various aspects of daily use, transforming the iPad into a versatile tool for work and leisure.

**Enhanced Productivity:** A physical keyboard dramatically increases typing speed and accuracy compared to the on-screen keyboard. Users can efficiently draft emails, write documents, and complete other text-intensive tasks.

This improved productivity is particularly beneficial for students, writers, and professionals who rely on their iPad for work and communication. The tactile feedback and familiar layout of a physical keyboard enable faster and more comfortable typing, reducing errors and fatigue.

**Portability and Convenience:** A keyboard case combines protection and functionality in a single accessory, eliminating the need for carrying a separate keyboard and case. This minimizes bulk and maximizes portability.

The convenience of having a keyboard readily available encourages users to take their iPad on the go and use it in various settings, such as coffee shops, libraries, and during travel. The integrated design simplifies setup and allows for seamless transitions between typing and tablet modes.

**Improved ergonomics:** adjustable viewing angles and a comfortable typing position promote better posture and reduce strain on the neck and wrists.

This is particularly important for users who spend extended periods working on their iPad. A well-designed keyboard case allows users to customize the viewing angle to suit their needs, minimizing glare and optimizing comfort. The physical keyboard also encourages a more natural wrist position, reducing the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.

**Protection from Damage:** The keyboard case provides a protective shell around the iPad, shielding it from scratches, bumps, and minor drops.The added layer of protection can significantly extend the lifespan of the iPad, especially for users who frequently travel or use it in demanding environments. Reinforced corners and durable materials help absorb impact and prevent damage to the screen and other sensitive components.

**Versatility and Functionality:** Many keyboard cases offer additional features, such as backlit keys, dedicated function keys, and Apple Pencil holders.

These features enhance the overall user experience and increase the versatility of the iPad.

**Keyboard Layout and Key Travel:** The keyboard's layout is paramount. A cramped or unconventional layout can significantly hinder typing speed and accuracy. Key travel, the distance a key moves when pressed, is another crucial factor. Deeper key travel generally provides a more satisfying and tactile typing experiance, mimicking a traditional keyboard. Look for cases with a generous key pitch (the distance between key centers) and sufficient key travel, ideally between 1.2mm and 1.5mm, for optimal comfort and efficiency.

The ergonomic design of the keyboard layout directly impacts user experience. A well-spaced layout minimizes errors and improves typing speed, crucial for extended use. The tactile feedback offered by the keys also plays a significant role in user satisfaction.

Robust materials like polycarbonate or TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) offer excellent impact resistance.consider the case's ability to withstand everyday wear and tear, including scratches, bumps, and drops. Look for cases with reinforced corners and edges, providing extra protection to vulnerable areas.

Look for cases that support Bluetooth 5.0 or later for a stable and energy-efficient connection. Battery life is also a crucial consideration.

(Haven't smelled originals so ratings aren't based on how accurate they are)

Shaghaf Oud Tonka - 10/10, Smells like an almond sugar cookie with vanilla icing

Ramz Silver - 10/10, Juicy pear with rich vanilla

Cream Velvet - 9/10, Very lactonic vanilla, reminds me of coffee creamer. I also get a slight almond note

Caffe Latte - 9/10, Smells like cream velvet, but less lactonic with a black coffee note blended very well

Nebras - 8.5/10, A musky sugary vanilla with cacao notes, kinda reminds me of chocolate milk

9pm - 8.5/10, Smells like ramz but with an apple note and a tiny bit fresher

Versace Pour Homme - 8/10, Citrus galore with slight florals, wish it lasted more

Khair Fusion - 8/10, Smells like fresh fruity candy, like pink starbursts

Khamrah - 7.5/10, A very cinnamon-y/spicy vanilla oriental/candle scent (not in a bad way)

Liam - 7.5/10, A rich fig tea vanilla fragrance

Hawas - 7.5/10, Smells like men's deodorant/soap, a pretty good dumb reach

Club De Nuit EDT - 7/10, A nice woody/smoky scent, not really my type of fragrance

Amber Oud Gold Edition 7/10 - Luxurious musky melon fruit basket. Would be ranked higher, but there's like a metallic screechiness up close that I really don't like

Supremacy in Heaven - 7/10 (Only one where I've smelled the OG), A metallic woody tea/black currant scent. More woody/harsh and less floral than the original

Detour Noir - 6.5/10, Probably needs to mature, all I'm getting is an aromatic apple + vanilla in the background

Nautica Voyage - 6/10, A nice woody/apple aquatic, just doesn't last. Get hawas instead

Qaed al Fursan Unlimited - 5.5/10, Coconut lotion/suntan, veryy situational and feminine

Fakhar Extrait - 4.5/10, A spicy grapefruit + leather/cashmere fragrance, not my cup of tea

Game of Spades Win - 4/10, This one was a letdown. Smells like slightly fresh/fruity patchouli or oakmoss, something like that. Couldn't smell it out of the box, so maybe it needs to mature

Bade'e al Oud Sublime - 3/10, Smells like juicy apple/lychee for about 10 seconds, then smells like a spicy patchouli/moss scent with absolutely no fruity notes. Maybe fake

Feel free to rate my collection! I've also been looking for a fresh fruity fragrance, amber oud gold isn't really cutting it, I wanna smell like a sweet, fresh and juicy fruit basket. Any recs?

I've just stumbled upon this magical community and am absolutely THRILLED about the possibility of creating apps without writing code (my brain tends to short-circuit when faced with actual programming languages).

My humble quest: Transform these spreadsheets that have been keeping my finances from imploding into an actual, honest-to-goodness app! As you can see from the images.

https://preview.redd.it/fu43cr2izhue1.png?width=2023&format=png&auto=webp&s=c50020a83fdfd7dba6805f3b1cca9615fd3ac0e2

The dream features I'm hoping to conjure:

* A financial overview dashboard showing planned vs. actual expenses/income (because reality rarely matches my optimistic plans)
* An automatic daily spending allowance calculator that adjusts in real-time (to prevent those ""how did I spend THAT much?"" moments)
* A transaction section where I can confess all my impulse purchases

I've dutifully watched the starter tutorial videos, but when I tried adapting existing templates, things got... complicated. My ""simple budget app"" suddenly felt about as simple as quantum physics.

Any guidance from you no-code veterans would be treasured more than finding an extra $20 in my winter coat pocket! I promise to share my creation with family members who also need help adulting with their finances.

Thanks in advance for any wisdom you can bestow upon this eager newbie! May your apps never crash and your coffee always be hot. ☕",1,1744504597.0,nocode,0,1.0,False

How do I fix this?,"We’ve got our Lawnseeker L22 mower up and running, and we’re using an Android phone with the Sunseeker app to control it. Our L22 now has a name: Tony.
 
Why Tony? Because he behaves exactly like my old English bulldog… also, you guessed it, named Tony.
 
Tony the dog wasn’t very bright. He’d ignore commands, stare off into the void, attempt to walk *through* coffee tables, and occasionally lick the wall for reasons known only to him.
 
Tony the mower? Same energy.
 
Sometimes he won’t pair via Bluetooth, even if you’re standing right next to him, waving your phone like a magic wand. The only fix? Unplug his base and plug it back in, like you’re rebooting a sullen teenager. And when we do finally get him to pair and send a command to mow or edge, the *app* will happily report that the command went through (though sometimes it says “returning” for no clear reason)… but Tony just sits there on the base, fully charged and utterly disinterested.
  
Occasionally, Tony surprises us and actually responds. When that happens, we celebrate like he’s taken his first steps — only to be crushed later when we realize it was just a fluke.
  
But here’s where things get really weird.
 
Tony the dog had a habit of showing up when you least expected him — like you’d just seen him asleep on his bed, but two minutes later he’s across the house, clearly up to something that proved he’d been messing with you all along.

Tony the mower? Same deal. He’s covered under a tarp in the back yard to protect him from rain, hasn’t been sent a command, and no schedule has been set… but suddenly, there he is: randomly bumbling around the front yard like a pinball between boundary wires. No prompt. No warning. Just vibing out hard.
 
And then — true to both Tonys — he gets himself into dumb, avoidable situations. Like a few nights ago, when he randomly decided to start mowing in the middle of the night. We woke up to find him backed against the neighbor’s house, completely out of power, his wheels dug into the ground like he’d been tunneling to freedom Shawshank style. Mud divots, torn grass, the whole mess.
  
What’s especially baffling is that Tony *can* behave. He’ll complete a full edging cycle like a champ — tidy lines, no confusion, staying well within his little wired kingdom. And we’ve watched him go for hours without a problem like he actually understands the assignment.
  
But then, without warning, Tony slips into full bulldog mode — stubborn, slow, and clearly unbothered by “rules.” One minute he’s peacefully charging under the tarp, the next he’s out in the yard, mowing on his own terms and plowing right past boundary wires like they’re mere suggestions. No command, no schedule — just unhinged lawn chaos.
  
So yeah, when my dog was dumb, it was kind of endearing. But when my robot is dumb… it’s just maddening.
 
Any ideas what’s going on here? How do we get this thing to behave? Also, I keep seeing folks talk about “zones” and “mapping” — but I can’t figure out where that happens in the app. Am I using the wrong version? Is there a secret menu? Help.",1,1744504403.0,SunseekerRoboticMower,1,1.0,False
1jxvibn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFWr4rIndia/comments/1jxvibn/20_m4f_delhi_looking_for_a_genuine_relationship/,20 [M4F] Delhi - Looking for a genuine relationship to share our feelings and build a relationship.,"Hey there, mysterious internet person 👋

I'm a 25-year-old boy who's somewhere between “has his life together” and “double-checks simple things just to be sure.” I’m here hoping to stumble across someone who’s down for real connection — the kind with inside jokes, vulnerable talks at 2am, and sending each other weird memes like a love language.

A little about me:

- I’ve got a job I enjoy, (I work as a Video Editor for a Youtube channel).

- Emotionally available, introspective, and probably too self-aware for my own good.

- I'm big into philosophy — not in a ""quoting Nietzsche to sound deep"" kind of way, but more like ""let's unpack our childhood traumas and talk about existence over coffee at 1am.""

- Movies are my comfort zone. From slow-burn A24 stuff to chaotic thrillers to deep, emotionally gut-punching dramas, I love getting lost in a good story. If you’ve ever cried over a movie character like they were real, you get me.

- I like deep convos, absurd humor, psychology, long walks (mentally or literally), and trying to understand this strange experience called being human.

- Basically, I'm just a curious mind wrapped in a cozy hoodie with access to decent WiFi.

What I’m looking for:  
I don’t have a long checklist, but I vibe best with women who are emotionally intelligent, compassionate, and open to sharing their perspectives (even if they differ from mine — I love hearing new angles on things). Some shared interests are cool but not required — just be someone who’s thoughtful, understanding, and can handle some playful sarcasm and occasional philosophical spirals.

Long distance? Totally cool with me. Let’s just start by talking and see where it goes. No pressure to jump into anything — I’m more interested in the *c*onnection than a rushed label.

Bonus points if you:

- Like voice notes more than paragraphs  
- Have a favorite comfort show or rewatch the same movie like it’s therapy.  
- Can roast me just enough to keep me humble

If any of this sounds like your jam, slide into my DMs with your favorite movie, quote, or a random deep thought you’ve had lately. Worst case? We exchange a few good memes. Best case? We’re planning a cute video date with snacks and an overly analyzed movie night.

Looking forward to hearing from someone cool (is it you? 👀)",1,1744504269.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

1jxvg8y,https://i.redd.it/p2mob8vwqhue1.jpeg,My twist on the Espresso Martini - Introducing the Iran-Contra," I've also got some homemade pistachio orgeat sitting in my fridge and was wondering what I might do with it. First thought was something with pistachio and banana, like a nice banana-nut bread. That's when my mind started running, and making connections. Pistachios - Iran. Bananas - Central America. [Iran-Contra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair) came to mind, and then I started wondering how I could bring this cocktail home. I thought: what else is Central America known for? Coffee, obviously. So I figured a banana-nut espresso martini would be both a safe bet, since I'm not straying too far from something tried and true, and it fits the theme. Figured I might as well give it a try, especially when I've got a family gathering coming up for Easter and my parents are very fond of epsresso martinis.  


**Ingredients:**

* 4 banana rounds, cut 1/4 inch thick
* 1/4 oz. Kahlua
* 2 oz. Flor de Caña Nicaraguan Rum (I used 7 year)
* 1/2 oz. pistachio orgeat
* 1 oz. fresh espresso
* 1 dash of Regan's orange bitters no. 6

**Recipe:**

1.  Muddle the banana and Kahlua together in a shaker. 
2.  Add remaining ingredients and ice. Shake until chilled.
3. Double strain (double straining is *important*) into your glass. Garnish with a banana chip. Serve with one TOW missile.

I was relieved to find that the banana and pistachio flavours do actually come through, but there's a nice smokiness from the espresso/rum combo too (moreso than a traditional vodka espresso martini). Mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy, and the banana definitely has to do with that. At the start of the drink, it's only creamy, but once you get to the very bottom of the drink it's a bit thicker, like halfway to a smoothie territory, and I found some banana residue at the bottom of the glass when I was done. Which makes it sound bad or unpleasant, but actually whatever banana does make it through the double strain blends in nicely. I never sensed any particles or any grainy feel.

In the future I'd love to try this with a banana liqueur in place of real bananas, something like Tempis Fugit Creme de Banane, but that's not so easy to get around where I live. I also might bump up the pistachio orgeat to 3/4 oz. because this is the first time I've made an espresso martini with rum in place of vodka, and I think a little more sweetness could compensate for the extra smokiness/oak the Flor de Cana brings.",5,1744504082.0,cocktails,0,1.0,False
1jxvf6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Icecream101/comments/1jxvf6f/chocolate_banana_vegan_ice_cream_recipe_peanut/,Chocolate Banana Vegan Ice Cream Recipe (Peanut Butter Swirl),"Creative Variations on Chocolate Banana Vegan Ice Cream Recipe (Peanut Butter Swirl)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you ready to take your chocolate banana vegan ice cream recipe with a peanut butter swirl to exciting new heights? This delicious treat is versatile, and with a few creative variations, you can make it even more irresistible. Let’s dive into some fun twists that will keep your taste buds tingling!

### 1. Nutty Add-Ins

If you love crunch in your ice cream, consider adding a nutty element. Chopped walnuts or pecans can elevate the texture and flavor. Simply fold them into the base after blending your chocolate banana mixture. This adds a delightful crunch that complements the creamy peanut butter swirl beautifully.

### 2. Coconut Cashew Swirl

For a tropical twist, swap out peanut butter for a coconut cashew spread. This nut butter alternative enhances the richness of the ice cream. You can create a delicious coconut flavor to enhance the combination of banana and chocolate. Just warm the coconut cashew butter slightly before swirling it into the chocolate banana mixture for a smooth incorporation.

### 3. Superfood Boost

Amplify the health benefits of your ice cream by adding superfoods. Consider incorporating:

- **Chia seeds:** These tiny seeds provide omega-3 fatty acids and fiber. Stir in a tablespoon before freezing.
- **Cacao nibs:** For an intense chocolate flavor and crunch, add a handful of cacao nibs.
- **Spinach or kale:** If you’re feeling adventurous, blend in a small handful of leafy greens. Don’t worry; the banana and chocolate will mask the taste!

### 4. Flavor Infusions

Why stop at chocolate? Experiment with flavor combinations that excite your palate. Here are some ideas:

​ Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ​  
  
- **Mint Chocolate:** Add a few drops of peppermint extract for a refreshing minty flavor.
- **Coffee Swirl:** Incorporate a shot of espresso or instant coffee granules to give your ice cream a delightful caffeine kick.
- **Cinnamon Chocolate:** Sprinkle a dash of cinnamon into the mixture for warm, comforting notes.

### 5. Fruity Swirls

For a fruity experience, incorporate other fruits into your ice cream. You can blend in:

- **Strawberries:** Fresh or frozen strawberries can be added for a sweet-tart contrast.
- **Mango:** A tropical twist can be achieved by incorporating ripe mango chunks.
- **Raspberry:** Swirl in raspberry puree for a vibrant color and tart flavor that pairs well with the chocolate.

### 6. Dairy-Free Whipped Topping

Add a layer of creamy whipped coconut cream on top before serving. Whipping coconut cream can create a luxurious topping that’s vegan and complements the flavors perfectly. Simply chill a can of coconut milk, whip the solidified cream, and dollop it over your ice cream for a delightful finish.

### 7. Chocolate Ganache Drizzle

Take your ice cream to another level with a luscious chocolate ganache drizzle. Melt dark vegan chocolate with a bit of coconut milk to create a pourable sauce. Drizzle this over the finished ice cream for an added layer of chocolatey goodness that will impress anyone you serve!

### 8. Seasonal Flavors

Embrace the seasons with flavors that reflect what's fresh and fun. For example:

​ Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ​  
  
- **Fall:** Add pumpkin spice for a seasonal twist.
- **Summer:** Try infusing with refreshing herbs like basil or mint.
- **Spring:** Incorporate fresh lemon zest to brighten the flavors.

With these creative variations, your chocolate banana vegan ice cream with a peanut butter swirl can become a canvas for culinary art. Feel free to experiment, mix, and match these ideas to create your unique version. Every scoop can be an exciting new adventure!

Health Benefits of Using Peanut Butter in Vegan Desserts
--------------------------------------------------------

Peanut butter is a beloved ingredient in many vegan desserts, and for a good reason. This creamy and rich spread not only adds a delicious flavor but also brings a host of health benefits that make it an excellent choice for those with a sweet tooth. Here’s how incorporating peanut butter into your vegan desserts can elevate both taste and wellness.

First and foremost, peanut butter is a great source of plant-based protein. This nutrient is essential for muscle repair and growth, making it particularly beneficial for vegans who may be looking for alternative protein sources. In just two tablespoons of peanut butter, you can find about 8 grams of protein, giving you a substantial boost in your daily intake. This makes it a perfect addition to smoothies, brownies, or granola bars.

Another incredible benefit is the healthy fats found in peanut butter. Unlike saturated fats, the monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats in peanut butter can help reduce bad cholesterol levels. This means that using peanut butter in your vegan desserts can contribute positively to your heart health. The inclusion of peanut butter can make a chocolate banana vegan ice cream recipe even richer and more satisfying while ensuring you stick to heart-healthy fats.

Moreover, peanut butter is packed with vitamins and minerals, including vitamins E and B6, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus. These nutrients play a crucial role in boosting your overall health. Vitamin E, for instance, acts as an antioxidant that helps protect your cells from damage, while magnesium supports muscle function and energy production.

​ Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ​  
  
Peanut butter also contains fiber, which promotes good digestion. Fiber is essential for maintaining a healthy gut, improving satiety, and regulating blood sugar levels. When you indulge in a peanut butter-infused dessert, you not only satisfy your sweet cravings but also support your digestive health. This feature makes it a smart choice for various desserts, including pies and energy balls.

Many people appreciate peanut butter for its ability to curb unhealthy snack cravings. The combination of protein and healthy fats makes peanut butter exceedingly filling. By adding peanut butter to desserts, you help manage your appetite more effectively, potentially preventing overeating and allowing for a healthier relationship with food. Imagine enjoying a rewarding slice of peanut butter chocolate cake without the guilt!

Using peanut butter in desserts is also a smart way to enhance the flavor profiles of your dishes. Its unique taste can complement numerous ingredients, from bananas to chocolate, creating irresistible vegan desserts. For instance, a chocolate banana vegan ice cream recipe paired with a swirl of peanut butter amplifies both health benefits and indulgence, providing a dessert that is nourishing and delicious.

In addition to its flavor and health benefits, peanut butter is generally affordable and widely available. You can easily find it at grocery stores, making it a convenient pantry staple. Whether you opt for creamy or crunchy, organic or conventional, you have a wealth of choices to suit your taste and dietary needs.

We're doing a very laidback welcome dinner Friday night. Everyone is invited. Wedding is Saturday. 

Here's the dilemma. The day after our wedding, Sunday, is my birthday. (Not ideal but we were limited on dates.) I feel like at least some of those out of towners may want to hang out the next morning before they leave. I'm totally down to grab coffee and a bagel but I don't want to do a whole brunch. It just seems like too much to plan, another thing to spend money on, and some of these people tend to run late. So while I absolutely don’t want to get up super early, I don’t want to feel like we’re waiting around all day. We’re also planning to stay at a fancy 5 star hotel on Sunday night, so while I’m good spending the morning with folks before they head home, I still want to get to enjoy the day together as husband and wife at this nice hotel. 

Is it rude if we just do a casual “meet us for a coffee or bagel” at a local place? It wouldn’t be many people so it shouldn’t be an issue versus a sit down breakfast.

Should we book the fancy hotel a different day? Skip it altogether? I’m really looking forward to it but I don’t want to be rude if people want to hang out Sunday.

Or should I just wait and see people’s travel plans? I do expect people to head home Sunday so I might be stressing myself out over this for nothing lol",9,1744503923.0,weddingplanning,15,0.92,False
