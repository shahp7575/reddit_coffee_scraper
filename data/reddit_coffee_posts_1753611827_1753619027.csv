I‚Äôm looking for a few people to regularly exchange cards with ‚Äì ideally, people with shared interests/hobbies/ideas. There‚Äôs no set schedule; you can send a card (or two) every month or as often as you want, and each card can be independent and doesn‚Äôt have to be a response or anything. But ideally, it should be an ongoing exchange.

A little bit about me: I love language learning, reading, journaling, gaming, arts and crafts, coffee, etc. I love going on solo dates (cafes, bookstores, libraries, parks, museums, cozy events!). I have more info on my profile.¬† I have a lot of stationery and I enjoy decorating my cards with stickers and washi tape.

Here are a few things you can write about in the cards:

* your latest hobbies, hyperfixations, or favorites (can be a book, anime, game, or your favorite coffee!)
* a recent fun adventure
* something you‚Äôre looking forward to
* simple pleasures/joys or simple wins
* a book you just read¬†
* language learning progress/wins
* recent reflections
* ‚Ä¶and so on!

Let‚Äôs keep it chill and cozy! I don‚Äôt want to talk about anything too heavy, personal, controversial, political, etc. I don‚Äôt like talking about work/career as well.

I also speak Spanish, so it would be nice to exchange cards in Spanish!

Please send me a chat if you‚Äôre interested ‚Äì plus a bit about you and why this post resonated with you.

I can‚Äôt wait to hear from you! ¬†ü•∞",1,1753618868.0,RandomActsofCards,0,1.0,False

1maksux,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1maksux,"I just did a water cupping - same coffee but brewed with tap water, filtered tap water and Volvic","When I started my coffee journey I used tap water, later switched to Volvic and then bought a Brita filter to save costs.

Lately I was curious to compare the three side by side. I used an affordable Gesha from a local roaster (56‚Ç¨/kg). It's not extraordinary but has some complexity which I thought would be nice to compare the different brewing waters. 

To not be biased I put numbers below the cups and shuffled them.

When cupping them (A, B, C from left to right, shuffled, not knowing which is which) I observed the following:

Unsurprisingly, they all tasted similar, but B had a bit more aroma and more acidity. A and C were harder to distinguish, while I had the feeling that A was a little thinner and mellow with the least acidity. B was slightly more flavorful and had a bit silkier texture than A. 

C being in the middle I assumed it is the filtered water, which is also somewhere between the unfiltered tap water and the soft Volvic. For A and B I wasn't so sure. The higher mineral content of tap water could lead to higher extraction, which might be an augment for B having the most aroma. However, with B being the best of all thee I was worried that this might be true, because I don't like the scale build up in my kettle. On the other hand, B having the highest acidity was a good indicator that it actually is the Volvic. 

When I checked, I was happy that my observations also aligned with the theory:

A: tap  
B: Volvic  
C: filtered

Since Brita filters don't reduce the mineral contents a lot (at least for magnesium and calcium) it makes sense the A and C were rather similar. Volvic standing out among the three also fits to it being recommended often for having a good mineral composition.

Maybe water chemistry is my next rabbit hole. I don't really like spending a lot of money on Volvic but I might ask my local roasters if they are willing to give away their brewing water in some 5L canisters.

Next? She made me text my ex ‚ÄúHope you're doing well üòâ‚Äù  
Yes. **MY EX.**  
If I go missing, you know why.

Midday was chaos. She had me pretend I was on a phone call with her in public and *moan softly* just to ‚Äúassert dominance.‚Äù  
I‚Äôm not even joking. I was in Target, and people kept staring at me.

Later, she asked me to tell her what I was wearing (again), called me her ‚Äúobedient little boyfriend,‚Äù and demanded I thank her for *""improving my confidence with her love and dominant guidance.‚Äù*  
I said thank you twice. I think I meant it.

## Key Features Analysis

The models featured in this review showcase a commitment to quality, innovation, and user-friendly design. Understanding their technical specifications is essential for choosing the perfect fit for your individual needs.

**Integrated Burr Grinder:**

The cornerstone of these machines is the integrated burr grinder, which ensures consistent and uniform coffee grounds. Unlike blade grinders that chop beans unevenly, burr grinders crush the coffee beans between two rotating abrasive surfaces, preserving their aroma and flavor.Models like the Breville Grind Control offer adjustable grind settings to tailor the coarseness to your preferences, optimizing extraction for different coffee types. The precision of the grinder directly impacts the taste of the final cup.

**Programmable Brew Settings:**

Advanced features, such as programmable brew settings, allow for customization of water temperature, brew strength, and cup size. Machines like the Cuisinart Grind & brew Single-serve offer different brew strength options (mild,medium,strong),catering to individual taste preferences. Programmable timers allow you to set the machine to automatically grind and brew your coffee at a specific time, providing a convenient and aromatic start to your day.**Water Filtration System:**

Many of the top single-cup coffee makers come equipped with water filtration systems. Water quality significantly affects the taste of coffee, and these filters remove impurities like chlorine and sediment. Using filtered water results in a cleaner, more flavorful cup of coffee. Some machines even feature replaceable charcoal filters to further enhance water purity.

**Direct-Brew Technology:**

Direct-brew technology ensures that the coffee is instantly brewed after grinding, preventing the loss of volatile aromatic compounds. This contributes to a fresher and more flavorful cup.Some models also feature pre-infusion, a process where hot water is briefly introduced to the grounds before brewing, allowing for blooming and enhancing flavor extraction.

**Removable Components for Easy Cleaning:**

Ease of maintenance is a huge factor.Look for models with removable brew baskets, water reservoirs, and drip trays. These components should ideally be dishwasher-safe for convenient cleaning.Regular cleaning is crucial for optimal performance and preventing the buildup of coffee oils and residue.

**Variable Cup Size Options:**

These coffee makers cater to diverse needs by offering variable cup size options, ranging from small espresso shots to larger travel mugs. Some models allow you to program custom cup sizes, ensuring that you get the perfect amount of coffee every time. This versatility accommodates different preferences and brewing styles.

## Core Benefits

Choosing a single-cup coffee maker with a grinder extends beyond mere convenience; it offers tangible benefits that elevate the coffee-drinking experience.

**Superior Flavor and Freshness:**

The most significant benefit is the enhanced flavor derived from freshly ground coffee beans.Grinding beans just before brewing preserves their volatile oils and aromatic compounds, resulting in a richer, more vibrant cup. This is especially noticeable when comparing freshly ground coffee to pre-ground varieties that tend to lose their potency over time.

**Customization and Control:**

These machines offer a high degree of customization, allowing you to tailor your coffee to your exact specifications. Adjustable grind settings, brew strength options, and water temperature controls provide unparalleled control over the final cup. This empowers you to experiment with different coffee beans and find the perfect profile for your taste.

**Convenience and Time Savings:**

The all-in-one design of these coffee makers streamlines the brewing process, saving you time and effort. No need to fumble with separate grinders and brewers; simply add beans, select your settings, and enjoy a freshly brewed cup in minutes. This is especially valuable for busy mornings or anyone seeking a quick and efficient coffee solution.

**Reduced Waste:**

By eliminating the need for pre-packaged coffee pods or single-use filters, these machines contribute to a more lasting coffee routine. Grinding your own beans and using a reusable filter reduces waste and minimizes your environmental impact.

## FAQs Section

Addressing frequently asked questions can definitely help demystify the technology and alleviate common concerns before making a purchase.

**how do I choose the right grind setting?**

The optimal grind setting depends on the type of coffee bean and your personal preference. As a general guide, finer grinds are suitable for espresso, medium grinds for drip coffee, and coarser grinds for French press. Experiment with different settings to find the sweet spot that delivers the best flavor for your chosen coffee beans.

**How often should I clean my coffee maker with grinder?**

Regular cleaning is essential for maintaining optimal performance and preventing the buildup of coffee oils and mineral deposits. It is indeed recommended to clean the grinder burrs weekly and descale the machine monthly, especially if you live in an area with hard water. Refer to your manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning recommendations.**Can I use flavored coffee beans in my single-cup coffee maker?**

While most coffee makers can handle flavored beans, it is important to note that the oils from flavored beans can sometimes leave a residue that is arduous to remove, potentially affecting the flavor of subsequent brews. Consider using a separate grinder or thoroughly cleaning your machine after using flavored beans.

**What type of filter should I use?**

Many single-cup coffee makers come with a reusable filter, which is a good environmentally friendly option. However, paper filters can also be used for those who prefer a cleaner cup of coffee with less sediment. Ensure that the filter is compatible with your machine's filter basket.

## Intro & Context: Brazil‚Äôs Macro Snapshot and the Promise of AI

Brazil stands at a crossroads of economic potential and technological transformation. As Latin America‚Äôs largest economy and the world‚Äôs 10th largest by GDP, Brazil boasts a diverse macroeconomic profile: a powerhouse in agriculture, a resilient industrial base, and a rapidly expanding services sector. Services now account for over 70% of Brazil‚Äôs GDP, with industry around 20% and agriculture roughly 6‚Äì8%. Yet behind these broad strokes lies a story of untapped productivity and stark inequalities. The promise of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital innovation offers a tantalizing path to boost productivity, inclusion, and sustainability across Brazil‚Äôs economic landscape ‚Äì if harnessed strategically and collaboratively.

Why AI, and why now? Brazil‚Äôs recovery from the pandemic has been surprisingly strong (3.4% GDP growth in 2024), but long-term growth has been constrained by low productivity gains. AI and advanced digital technologies present an opportunity to ‚Äúleapfrog‚Äù traditional development barriers, augmenting human expertise in everything from farming to finance. Crucially, this must be a Brazilian journey. It‚Äôs about infusing local ingenuity ‚Äì the creativity of our entrepreneurs, the wisdom of our farmers, the passion of our educators ‚Äì with cutting-edge AI tools, in a way that reflects Brazil‚Äôs cultural richness and values.

This post speaks directly to Brazil‚Äôs innovators and changemakers: how can we co-create an inclusive, AI-empowered future that accelerates growth while narrowing social gaps? We‚Äôll diagnose where we stand today, spotlight high-impact sectors ripe for AI-human collaboration, examine our readiness and hurdles, and map actionable frameworks to ensure every Brazilian can share in the gains of this new era.

## GDP Breakdown & Tech Sector Trends

To chart where AI can make a difference, we first need a clear picture of Brazil‚Äôs economic composition and the role of the tech sector within it.

**Brazil‚Äôs GDP by sector:** Services dominate our economy, contributing roughly 59% of value-added (by 2023) ‚Äì encompassing commerce, finance, health, education, public administration, and more. Industry (manufacturing, mining, construction, utilities) makes up about 22%, and agriculture around 6‚Äì8%. Notably, agriculture punches above its weight in driving growth and exports: when we include the entire agrifood complex, its contribution reaches ~22% of GDP. In 2023, booming harvests helped agriculture contribute nearly one-third of Brazil‚Äôs GDP growth. In short, farming feeds our trade surplus, industry anchors formal employment, and services underpin domestic demand ‚Äì a broad base that AI can energize in different ways.

**Tech sector‚Äôs rising share:** Brazil‚Äôs technology and digital industries have been growing faster than the economy at large. According to Brasscom industry reports, the ICT sector reached R$707.7 billion in revenue in 2023, about 6.5% of GDP, after average annual growth of 11.9% over the past three years. This employed 2.05 million professionals (4% of all jobs) in 2023, with an average salary more than double the national average. Brazil is now the world‚Äôs 10th largest ICT market, accounting for 30% of all tech market revenue in Latin America.

**Services going digital:** In 2023, even as overall services grew ~2.4%, the sub-sector ‚ÄúInformation and communication‚Äù grew +2.6% and financial services grew +6.6% ‚Äì likely reflecting fintech and digital banking gains. Brazil‚Äôs creative industries now account for about 3.6% of GDP (R$393 billion in 2023), with half driven by technology-related activities.

Overall, Brazil‚Äôs economy is service-heavy and driven by its huge internal market ‚Äì but technology is increasingly the engine within that machine. The stage is set for AI and digital innovation to amplify productivity in each sector.

## Precision Agriculture: AI and Drones Transforming Farming

Agriculture has always been Brazil‚Äôs bread and butter ‚Äì and now it‚Äôs becoming our silicon chip, too. Precision agriculture powered by AI, drones, and IoT is revolutionizing how Brazilians farm, helping us produce more food with less land, water, and chemicals.

**Agtech by the numbers:** Brazil has seen an explosion of agritech startups. The Radar Agtech Brasil 2023 survey identified 1,953 agtech startups, a 15% jump from the previous year. These span the value chain: about 17% focus on ‚Äúpre-farm‚Äù needs (inputs, planning), others on on-farm management, and many on post-harvest logistics. The traditionally underserved North region saw a 300% increase in agtech startups (from 26 to 116 in one year) as digital solutions reach the Amazon and beyond.

**Drones and AI in the field:** In 2017, agri-drones were a rarity; by 2024, the Ministry of Agriculture had over 8,300 drones registered for farm use, up from just 1,100 two years prior. Industry experts estimate the real number could be 20,000+ and climbing. They allow farmers to map crops, spray pesticides with precision, and monitor crop health via imaging ‚Äì tasks AI algorithms enhance by analyzing aerial data for stress signs, pest outbreaks, or optimal harvest timing. Coffee growers using drone sprayers cut operational costs by up to 70% and halved their chemical use compared to manual methods. Brazil is now seen as a global leader in agricultural drone adoption, with the market valued at $77 million in 2024 and projected to quadruple by 2030.

**From big farms to smallholders:** Much of this tech initially served large plantations, but bringing AI to small and medium farmers is crucial. Coopercitrus, a major agricultural cooperative, launched a Mobile Drone Maintenance Unit in 2023 ‚Äì essentially a tech support van that travels to farms to service drones on-site. This unit can perform repairs and software updates right in the field, ensuring small farmers don‚Äôt suffer long downtimes. Coopercitrus also runs training programs that have taught hundreds of farmers how to operate drones and interpret data, offering financing plans to help farmers acquire drones. This cooperative-led AI enablement shows how we can ensure high tech isn‚Äôt just for mega-farms.

**Moonshot partnership idea:** Imagine an ‚ÄúAI for Agro‚Äù public-private consortium bringing together Embrapa, top universities, co-ops like Coopercitrus, and agtech startups. Together they could build open datasets and train AI models tailored to tropical agriculture and smallholder needs ‚Äì like AI systems that give family farmers SMS alerts about pest outbreaks or micro-climate predictions for irrigation guidance. Given agriculture‚Äôs outsize impact on Brazil‚Äôs GDP and exports, gains here ripple through the whole economy.

## Fintech and Digital Banking Inclusion: Closing the Financial Gap

No sector has epitomized Brazil‚Äôs digital renaissance quite like fintech. In a country once plagued by high banking fees and tens of millions unbanked, fintech innovations are cracking the code of financial inclusion.

**Scale of Brazil‚Äôs fintech boom:** Brazil is now home to 1,500+ fintech startups ‚Äì about 59% of all fintechs in Latin America. A recent industry report counted 1,592 active fintechs as of mid-2024, collectively attracting US$10.4 billion in investment over the past decade. Brazil consistently produces fintech unicorns and market leaders (Nubank, Stone, PagSeguro, Ebanx) and holds 31% of Latin America‚Äôs fintech companies.

**Impact on financial inclusion:** The fintech wave, combined with supportive central bank initiatives, has tangibly expanded financial access. A pivotal development was Pix, the Central Bank‚Äôs instant payment system, launched in late 2020. In 2023 alone, Brazilians made almost 42 billion Pix transactions, a 75% increase over 2022. By year-end, 65 million Brazilians were ‚Äúfrequent users‚Äù of Pix ‚Äì a remarkable figure in a country of ~214 million people. Pix has essentially turned every smartphone into a banking tool, enabling even street vendors to participate in the digital economy with zero-fee instant transfers. Digital banks like Nubank (with ~80 million clients) have onboarded millions who previously had no access to credit cards or savings accounts.

**AI‚Äôs role in fintech:** Fintech firms leverage AI for credit scoring using alternative data, chatbot assistants for customer service, and fraud detection systems using machine learning. Brazilian fintechs were among the first to use AI for credit risk modeling ‚Äì analyzing mobile phone bill patterns or smartphone usage metadata to extend loans to people traditional models would reject. AI-powered chatbots handle millions of routine queries, helping new digital users navigate apps in conversational Portuguese.

**Moonshot partnership idea:** Launch a ‚ÄúDigital Inclusion Taskforce‚Äù uniting fintech startups, big banks, the Central Bank, and community groups. This could deploy mobile financial services units to remote areas, use AI translators for local languages, and create AI-driven microcredit cooperatives that analyze non-traditional data to provide fair-rate loans to informal workers and small farmers.

## Remote Healthcare: Telemedicine and AI Reaching the Unreached

In a country as vast as Brazil, equitable healthcare access has always been a challenge. Enter telehealth and AI ‚Äì a combination that promises to bridge distance and resource gaps in our health system.

**Telemedicine‚Äôs surge:** Once restricted by regulation, telemedicine truly took off after nationwide legalization in 2022. The number of telemedicine consultations jumped 172% in 2023 alone. By year-end, Brazilians had completed over 30 million remote medical consultations ‚Äì including 4.6 million within SUS. This explosion shows Brazilians‚Äô willingness to adopt digital health solutions when accessible and trusted.

**Reaching rural and underserved patients:** Patients in the Amazon or semi-arid Northeast can now connect to specialists in S√£o Paulo or Recife without costly travel. AI tools are increasingly part of this pipeline: in radiology, AI algorithms assist in reading X-rays for remote diagnosis; in ophthalmology, AI-powered smartphone adapters screen for diabetic retinopathy. Brazilian startups use AI to pre-screen EKG readings so a single cardiologist can oversee hundreds of patients‚Äô heart data.

**Healthtech ecosystem:** Liga Ventures identified 536 active healthtech startups in Brazil as of early 2024, operating across 35 healthcare categories. Over 80+ investment deals totaled ~R$1 billion from Jan 2023 to Apr 2024. Notably, 89 startups explicitly apply AI ‚Äì for analyzing medical images, personalizing treatments, or predicting disease outbreaks. Success stories include Portal Telemedicina‚Äôs AI platform connecting clinics with remote specialists, and Laura, an AI virtual assistant monitoring patient vitals for sepsis risks.

**Moonshot partnership idea:** Establish a ‚ÄúUnified Telehealth & AI Network‚Äù linking federal, state, and municipal health services with private innovators. Deploy AI-equipped diagnostic kiosks in remote health posts, create an open medical data sandbox for Brazilian AI researchers, and train 10,000 community health agents in digital tools. This could ensure no Brazilian is left behind due to geography or lack of specialists.

## Advanced Manufacturing: Industry 4.0 and the Future of Factories

Brazil‚Äôs industrial sector is undergoing a digital makeover often dubbed ‚ÄúIndustry 4.0‚Äù ‚Äì integrating automation, sensors, data analytics, and AI into production.

**Industry 4.0 growth:** The market for Industry 4.0 technologies in Brazil was estimated at US$1.77 billion in 2022, projected to reach $5.62 billion by 2028 ‚Äì a robust ~21% annual growth rate. Factories are using more sensors, automating processes, employing digital twins, and experimenting with AI for predictive maintenance. However, adoption is uneven ‚Äì surveys indicate most large Brazilian industrial companies are aware of Industry 4.0, but only a minority have implemented advanced projects due to high costs, skills gaps, and infrastructure challenges.

**Talent and skills gap:** Perhaps the biggest challenge is the shortage of qualified workers. In a global survey, 88% of Brazilian industrial firms struggled to find data scientists, automation engineers, or skilled technicians who can work with robotics and analytics ‚Äì higher than the 66% global average. Organizations like SENAI have ramped up ‚ÄúIndustry 4.0 Academy‚Äù programs, but demand far outstrips supply.

**SMEs and supply chain:** Many small and medium enterprises operate on thin margins with little capital for tech investment. Without help, they risk falling further behind, creating inefficiencies throughout supply chains. Some initiatives like BNDES funding have helped, but a national strategy to include SMEs in the Industry 4.0 revolution is needed.

**Moonshot partnership idea:** Launch ‚ÄúBrasil 4.0 ‚Äì SME Accelerator‚Äù providing matching funds, tech expertise, and training to clusters of small manufacturers. Establish University-Industry Labs in major industrial hubs, extend tax incentives for digitalization projects, and create a national retraining initiative to turn assembly line workers into robot maintenance technicians.

## Creative Industries & Cultural Tech: Unleashing Brazil‚Äôs Creative Economy with AI

Brazil‚Äôs creative industries contribute about 3.5% of GDP and are increasingly intersecting with technology. AI is providing new canvases for Brazilian creativity and new business models to monetize cultural talent globally.

**Digital creative boom:** Brazil‚Äôs game development industry has produced globally successful companies like Wildlife Studios (valued at over $3B). Streaming platforms have opened global markets for Brazilian music and film. The creative sector overlaps with tech startups through ‚Äúcreator economy‚Äù platforms and emerging NFT/metaverse projects. Roughly 50% of creative industry GDP comes from technology-related segments.

**AI as a creative tool:** Brazilian creators use AI for music composition, visual art generation, film subtitling and dubbing. AI voice synthesis can dub Brazilian content into other languages, potentially boosting cultural exports. AI can also preserve culture through digital restoration and language preservation projects for Brazil‚Äôs 274 indigenous languages.

**Moonshot partnership idea:** Form a ‚ÄúCreative Tech Alliance‚Äù to launch a ‚ÄúBrazilian Culture GPT‚Äù trained on our literature, music, and historical texts. Digitize and AI-tag vast cultural archives, and set up regional creative tech labs where artists experiment with AI tools while ensuring cultural authenticity remains central.

## AI Readiness & Barriers: How Prepared is Brazil for the AI Era?

**National AI Strategy and policy:** Brazil released a National AI Strategy in 2021, with the current administration announcing a revamp in December 2023. The LGPD provides a privacy foundation, and an AI Bill (PL 2338/2023) under debate could establish principles for AI development and use, potentially making Brazil the first G20 country with comprehensive AI legislation.

**Talent and ecosystems:** Brazil has strong STEM education and growing AI research community ‚Äì Brazilian researchers published 10,584 AI-related papers in 2022. However, only ~2% of Brazilian workers have advanced ICT skills, and diversity in AI is lacking with only 37% of STEM graduates being female. Brain drain remains a concern as top talent moves abroad.

**Infrastructure:** Internet access has improved (83% of Brazilians use the internet), but urban-rural gaps remain. The 5G rollout and fiber expansion are positive steps, though remote areas still lack high-speed connectivity. Cloud providers have established local regions, and there‚Äôs movement on local AI compute infrastructure.

**Public adoption and trust:** Surveys show 92% of Brazilian business managers are optimistic about AI‚Äôs positive impact, and 94% of large companies are implementing or planning AI systems. However, there‚Äôs public wariness about data misuse, and trust varies between private sector (86%) and government websites (48%).

In summary, Brazil‚Äôs AI readiness could be described as ‚Äúhigh potential, medium preparedness.‚Äù We must urgently invest in people, infrastructure, and robust governance to remove roadblocks.

## Case Studies & Success Stories: Brazilian Ingenuity in Action

**Coopercitrus‚Äô Digital Farming:** This 36,000-member cooperative introduced precision agriculture tools to even small family farms. Through their Campo Digital platform and mobile drone maintenance units, they‚Äôve helped farmers improve yields by 20% and cut costs by 15% while training over 120 members as licensed drone pilots.

**Letrus ‚Äì AI for Education:** This edtech startup developed an AI platform to improve student writing skills. After a controlled study showed students using Letrus achieved the 2nd highest average essay scores nationally on ENEM, the platform now serves 170,000 students across Brazil.

**Hospital Einstein ‚Äì Healthcare AI:** S√£o Paulo‚Äôs Hospital Albert Einstein implemented an AI early warning system for patient deterioration that identified 25% more at-risk patients than standard protocols, enabling life-saving interventions.

**Smart City Curitiba:** The city integrated AI-based traffic control reducing average travel time by 12%, launched participatory budgeting with AI sentiment analysis, and deployed AI chatbots for citizen services.

Each story highlights human-centric innovation where AI serves as a tool in Brazilian hands to solve local problems and improve lives.

## Strategic Roadmap: Empowering Citizens, Entrepreneurs, and Government

To achieve an inclusive, AI-empowered future for Brazil, we need coordinated efforts across all stakeholders:

**1. Invest in People:** Rapidly expand AI and digital skills training, update curricula, fund more university seats in data science, and incentivize STEM for underrepresented groups. The private sector should partner with SENAI for on-the-job training and fund coding bootcamps in low-income neighborhoods.

**2. Strengthen Infrastructure:** Treat internet connectivity as essential infrastructure, accelerate the National Broadband Plan, and invest in national AI cloud infrastructure. Industry should collaborate on expanding last-mile connectivity and shared 5G networks.

**3. Support Innovation:** Create thematic innovation funds for high-impact subsectors, streamline regulatory sandboxes, and simplify startup funding access. Investors should embrace open innovation and impact investments in inclusion-oriented tech.

**4. Foster Collaboration:** Establish formal mechanisms like a National AI Council and project-level consortia. Align incentives across sectors while including end-users in planning.

**5. Governance and Ethics:** Enact sensible AI regulation protecting rights without stifling innovation, strengthen enforcement institutions, and launch public awareness campaigns about AI literacy.

**6. Measure and Iterate:** Set concrete targets for 2025 and 2030, track progress through annual reports, and maintain accountability through transparent public updates.

## Conclusion: Calling All Brazilians to Co-Create Our AI Future

Brazil stands at the cusp of an AI revolution that offers a chance to turbocharge development while weaving a more inclusive social fabric. The seeds of an inclusive AI future are already sprouting across Brazil ‚Äì in drone-assisted farms, AI-aided classrooms, telemedicine reaching the Amazon, and creative AI labs reimagining culture. Our task is to nurture these sprouts into a flourishing landscape benefiting all Brazilians.

**To innovators and entrepreneurs:** Focus on our unique problems and opportunities. Build AI tools for diagnosing cassava diseases, platforms for translating indigenous languages, or fintech apps helping favela residents invest. Seek collaboration with universities, government programs, and international partners who respect local leadership.

**To policymakers and leaders:** Support innovation with consistent policy and funding. Break silos between ministries, empower institutions to be agile, and listen to voices on the ground. Continue Brazil‚Äôs international leadership as a voice for ethical AI in developing countries.

**To Brazilian citizens:** Be active co-creators, not passive bystanders. Demand transparency in AI use, participate in public consultations, experiment with new tools, and encourage your children to learn technology while instilling values of empathy and ethics.

The story of Brazil has always been one of potential ‚Äì often unrealized, but when realized, simply spectacular. With strategic action and unity of purpose, Brazil can transform its economy, leap ahead in productivity, and do so while bringing millions more into the fold. We can show the world a model of AI deployment that is socially inclusive, culturally rich, and deeply democratic.

This is a call to action. Vamos juntos ‚Äì let‚Äôs come together across sectors and ideologies to build a future where Brazil‚Äôs tech economy thrives and every Brazilian thrives with it. The ‚Äúcountry of the future‚Äù is poised to become the country of the present ‚Äì an AI-empowered present that we will shape with our own hands and hearts.

1mak98p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1mak98p/alternative_to_fire_a_small_business/,Alternative to fire: a small business?,"The vast vajority of Fire strategies are like this:

1> work ungodly hours in a job you potentially hate, but pays well

2> For 20 years, ideally in the US, honestly Fire isnt realistic with the meager wages / high taxes in most places

3> put every penny into the stock market

4> Retire and never work again

But, did anyone consider instead to invest the money into something nicer to work with? Like a small hotel, restaurant, whatever? Probably you can close down during off season.

I know a guy which was software engineer and totally quit and now owns a few coffee shops, he takes very long vacations as the business works without him most of the time. 

Is there a variant of Fire for that?

The main plus would be:

1> you are the boss instead of wage slave for a change

2> Can work with people instead of staring at a computer screen the rest of your days

I also know another guy yhat opened his own tech company, not sure it really was so good since after some time he went back to a job...

On the other hand I also saw people lose huge amounts with such businesses that didn't work...

1mak4zp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mak4zp/was_my_professor_even_slightly_involved_tmi/,Was my professor even slightly involved? TMI.,"I have a strange relationship with the professor. He‚Äôs in his late 60s, and I‚Äôm 25. I like him very much. He‚Äôs married. I thought our flirtation was mutual. He always told me I was very beautiful‚Äîlong neck, long legs‚Äîand sometimes touched my knee during conversations. He often held my hands when we rode the metro together, pressing his knee against mine or my thigh. Occasionally, he‚Äôd drop phrases like, 'You‚Äôre very prone to falling in love, and with the wrong people.'

Around mid-June, we went for coffee outside the university for the first time. After that, for two weeks, we walked around the city center almost every day for 2-3 hours, had coffee, and three times he even invited me to restaurants after our walks. We always had something to talk about‚Äîhistory, religion, science.  

I told him I liked restored antique furniture and showed him mine in my new apartment, where I was planning to move. In return, he photographed his own antique furniture day after day and showed me. He wanted to get me more into religion, the Bible, and nurtured my interest in the subject.  

During one walk, he mentioned it was his grandchildren‚Äôs birthday, but that day, he stayed with me until 9 p.m. In the metro, he always waited until I boarded my train, waving at me. When saying goodbye, we‚Äôd sometimes squeeze each other‚Äôs hands but never held them.  

On the escalator‚Äîespecially the long ones‚Äîhe‚Äôd stand one step below me, facing me, his back to the descent. His face was always so close! He often looked at my lips, and I at his. Then we‚Äôd smile awkwardly. Sometimes, if I wore a short T-shirt, he‚Äôd playfully tap the button on my jeans, grazing the bare skin of my stomach. I‚Äôd freeze, flustered. Later, he might lean in slightly and ask with a smile, 'Falling asleep? Are you relaxed?'.

In the train, we always sat side by side, his knee often pressing against mine or my thigh. As I said, we often walked until 8 or 9 p.m. Sometimes I‚Äôd ask if he was in a hurry, and he‚Äôd say, 'Not at all.' He frequently gave me compliments‚Äîgood posture, confident walk, long neck that 'should be adorned with a scarf.' He said he‚Äôd noticed me from the very first class, 'physically, I mean.'

When we walked and talked, our faces were very, very close. Twice, he took my hand while crossing the street‚Äîfor about 5-7 seconds. He often said my hands were cold, and I said his were warm. I told him he looked great, always well-dressed in a shirt and tie, and that I only liked men in such attire.  

A couple of times, we drank 20 ml of cherry liqueur in his office. Whenever we were close on the escalator or alone, I‚Äôd compliment his ties. After that, it seemed like he changed them daily, showing off his whole collection.  

Once on the train, I asked why he didn‚Äôt wear a ring. 'A wedding ring?' he clarified. I said, 'Yeah,' and he replied it didn‚Äôt fit anymore. He kept looking at his fingers, examining them. Then he asked, 'Why is your body tanned? You got sun somewhere? Your face is pale, but your body is tanned‚ÄîI‚Äôve seen it.'  

One walk stood out the most: again, he stood extremely close to me on the escalator. I told him his tie was beautiful and that he smelled nice. Exiting the train, he took my hand. He bought me ice cream during the walk. When someone called him unexpectedly, we leaned against a railing‚Äîhe talked on the phone while gently stroking the inside of my elbow. I nearly melted.  

We found a quieter bench. We almost kissed, sitting so close, faces nearly touching. He called me an 'amazing girl' and said he didn‚Äôt understand why others didn‚Äôt notice me. An old song played, and he smiled, 'You know, this song is from your grandmother‚Äôs era.' He blushed‚Äîso did I. He said I had long lashes. He was nervous, talking nonstop to fill the silence.  

Then I made a mistake and ruined the tension‚ÄîI said, 'Your wife is very lucky.' He started telling me how she almost died twice, but he saved her, how much they‚Äôd been through. He mentioned she once got into an accident coming to see him and later blamed him for it. Then he talked about building his business, saying, 'When you want to sin, it‚Äôs better to resist‚Äîbut sometimes you still fail.' All the while, he kept touching me, his face still close, holding my wrist, stroking my hands. His arm rested on the back of the bench.  

We sat like that, pressed together, for over an hour. Then we stood up‚Äîsomeone called him. I stood there disappointed, silently watching him as he talked, and he looked back at me. We stared at each other for about 5 seconds. I wasn‚Äôt shy around him anymore. I wanted him desperately.  

After that silent exchange, he walked over and calmly said, 'You‚Äôre very beautiful. My granddaughter looks a lot like you.' As we walked, he added, 'Thanks for walking with me. Want to visit a painter I know sometime? He could paint your portrait.'

On the way back to the metro, it rained. I held the umbrella at first, then he took it, and I held his arm tightly. At the metro, on the escalator, we stood close again, staring into each other‚Äôs eyes‚Äîhe smiled shyly and looked away. I nudged him and asked, 'What are you smiling about?'.
When we said goodbye, he squeezed my wrist firmly, and I lightly stroked his hand with my finger. We smiled at each other.

The next day, we went to a restaurant for dinner after our walk.  He served me food, saying, ""Let me take care of you."" Then someone called him, and for the entire conversation‚Äîabout five minutes‚Äîhe held my hand just above the elbow. We talked about something, smiling. Afterward, we walked for another hour and a half.  

As we strolled, he told me I was very feminine. He held my arm, then took my hand firmly‚Äîmy palm‚Äîwhile I lightly stroked his fingers with mine. Then he interlaced his fingers with mine, and we walked hand in hand. Suddenly, we fell silent. I looked at him, smiling, and he smiled back, glancing at the ground. Then I silently looked at him again, and he said, ""My dear friend.""

We didn‚Äôt let go of each other‚Äôs hands. I started leaning into him, even though we were already walking side by side. When I pressed closer, he said loudly, ""I GET IT!"" I got flustered, let go of his hand, and walked for about five minutes staring at my feet in silence. Then he started talking about landmarks, buildings, and so on. Later, he suggested I write an article myself. I wondered why he brought it up just then. I said I could try but wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd succeed. After a pause, he added, ""Well, let‚Äôs write it together then!"". The sexual tension seemed to vanish, and we walked as just friends.  

In the metro tunnel, walking side by side, he suddenly put his arm around my waist and pulled me close for 3-4 seconds. On the escalator, he said, ""Thanks for the walk! I wanted to give you attention!!!"" For some reason, this irritated me. I smirked and said, ""Thank you so much."" He replied that I‚Äôd misunderstood him. When we said goodbye, he squeezed my hand tightly and said, ""Goodbye.""  

We didn‚Äôt see each other again until three days later. He was very kind, said he was happy to see me, that he‚Äôd missed me, that it felt like ""a thousand years"" since we‚Äôd last met. He claimed he couldn‚Äôt even remember what he‚Äôd done in those three days‚Äîexcept our walks, which he remembered vividly. He noticed my new WhatsApp profile picture and said he‚Äôd watched Pretty Woman and that I resembled the main character but was ""much prettier."" He smiled often, pressing his knee against my thigh. When we said goodbye, he held my hand with both of his and said, ""They‚Äôre cold again.""  
I asked if he‚Äôd gotten a haircut. ""Yes, today,"" he replied.  

The last time we walked together was before my week-long trip to the seaside. It's worth noting that in restaurants, we always sat side by side rather than across from each other - it felt so nice to feel his body next to mine. That day I was typing an article in his office, we talked about everything, and agreed to leave the university at a certain time because I needed to pick up a dress from a tailor near my place. He suggested we go together and said he would have driven if he'd known earlier.
Then another woman, about 40-45 years old, came into his office. She sat down, flirted with him, even kissed his cheek when greeting him, which made me uncomfortable being there with them. He offered her tea, coffee, sweets - the same things he always offered me. She sat with her legs crossed in a skirt, and he clearly noticed - right in front of me. The most painful part was that when it was time for us to leave as we'd agreed, he kept talking to her. It really hurt me, though I tried not to show it. She complained about her blood pressure rising for the first time in her life, and he said ""Let me check your pulse,"" taking her wrist while she sat with her knee exposed in her dress. ""I'm young to you, but I'm already 45,"" she told him. I left the office for about 30 minutes, saw he called me but didn't answer. When I returned, we continued working - he seemed to be gauging my reaction, while I mostly kept my eyes on the screen.
Walking to the metro, I was silent and walked ahead of him while he lagged behind, not trying to catch up. I wasn't in the mood to smile or flirt. He saw me in a skirt for the first time and said he'd never seen me like that before. On the escalator, we stood face-to-face with no step between us. He suddenly leaned his head toward me but looked away. I caught the scent of his cologne and mentioned how good he smelled. Then I deliberately moved close to his neck, quickly inhaled and said ""Yes, it smells wonderful."" He replied ""I regret wearing it because now I can't smell your perfume.""

In the restaurant at first we sat with our arms touching, then he slightly moved away. During the meal, he taught me proper table manners - ""Look, this is how to hold the fork in your left hand and knife in the right. Try it."" I said ""No one ever taught me this, thank you."" While eating, he once placed his palm on my thigh for just a second. I touched his stomach once in return. Then he started talking about his article, what an interesting topic it was, saying if I worked on it for two more weeks after my trip I'd make great progress. For a moment I wondered if all our walks and outings were just to get me to help him with his work. He kept serving me food, adding sauces, feeding me. As we left, he said ""Next time we'll come here for breakfast."" At the metro station, we said goodbye - he squeezed my hand and wrist, I did the same. Looking at each other, he said ""Great dress! It suits you better than jeans. Goodbye.""

!!! We didn‚Äôt see each other at all the following week. He‚Äôd promised to call, but never did.  

When I returned, he seemed colder. Over the next two weeks‚Äîuntil our unofficial ""breakup""‚Äîhe never invited me out again: no walks, no restaurants. Instead, he offered me a month of working in his office (""You‚Äôll have AC, my snacks‚Äîeverything you need""), emphasizing how much he wanted me on his research team.  
Then, out of nowhere, he pivoted to relationship philosophy: ""Some thinker once said two men for one woman is excessive."" He rambled about physiological differences‚Äîhow men ""ignite instantly"" while women need time, how fleeting intimacy leaves you ""lost afterward.""
That first day back, we rode the metro together. I wore a short dress with a low neckline. ""I‚Äôm not used to seeing you like this,"" he said, eyes flicking between my legs and cleavage. On the escalator, he closed the gap between us, then stepped away. Later, he poked my stomach playfully and asked, ""Are you wearing lipstick?"".
In the train, he crossed his legs (was he hard? üòÇ) and glanced at my neckline. He guided us to an emptier car (""Let‚Äôs go here‚Äîfewer people""), briefly pressed his knee against mine, then withdrew. When my stop came, he stood to ""see me off""‚Äîthough the doors were right beside us.  

The next day, he left early for a funeral but said, ""I‚Äôd be glad if you called‚Äú. I didn‚Äôt. Instead, he called me four times: asking about my day, reminding me to take his milk and cheese from the fridge, joking he‚Äôd boarded the wrong train. His sign-off: ""Alright then, sunshine.""  

At 5 AM the following morning, he sent a ""Gospel of the Day"" video‚Äîstill pushing religion on me. That evening, he complimented my dress and ""long, graceful stride."" On the escalator, he faced me, staring at my lips until we both smiled.  
""Drive less,"" he advised. I teased, ""My car‚Äôs red‚Äîeveryone assumes a fool‚Äôs behind the wheel!"".  He laughed. ""How can you say that? You‚Äôre extraordinary. There‚Äôs no one else like you."" 

Yet the next day, when another woman (his 40-year-old PhD student) visited his office, he touched her arm repeatedly while loudly exclaiming, ""Listen!""‚Äîeyes darting to me. Was this jealousy bait?  

His hot-and-cold act intensified. He‚Äôd unbutton his shirt to mid-chest, slowly rubbing something near his collarbones while talking‚Äîfully aware of my gaze. Once, when we parted ways (a first), he noticed my disappointment and said flatly, ""I don‚Äôt want to leave you, but I must."" (His friends invited him somewhere). Then he sat across from me, deliberately tying his tie without a mirror. ""Why not use one?"" I asked. (God, I wanted him in those moments‚Äîso meticulous, so vain.)  

The next day, he made us cocoa in the campus kitchen. As I sat closer, he tickled my knee. Yet he never asked me out again‚Äîjust dropped hints like, ""Remember where we walked?"".

And so, this week, we unexpectedly began to drift apart.  
It‚Äôs worth mentioning that from Monday (07/21/25) until Friday, we left the university together every day, but he had started driving his car and would give me a ride home each time!  
In the car, he played classical music and once asked if I listened to that kind of music. I told him it was too calm for me. Then he asked, ""Am I too calm for you?"" and laughed. I nudged him lightly with my elbow and said no. Later, I asked him why he preferred driving a manual car. I said, ""I noticed you like keeping your hands busy,"" and he smirked. At a traffic light, he told me I had a nice tan but found it strange that my face hadn‚Äôt tanned. Then he dropped me off at home, I touched his forearm and said goodbye.  

In the following days, he started saying strange things to me: he kept complimenting me‚Äîtelling me I had a beautiful face, neck, long legs, and that I was tall.  
Once, he said he‚Äôd noticed about me that ""I could easily get carried away by the wrong kind of person."" That day, I immediately acted very cold toward him. I didn‚Äôt know how to express my disappointment‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt understand what he meant by those phrases. I mustered up the courage and asked him, ""Were our walks sincere?""
 He replied, ""What do you think? Of course they were. Weren‚Äôt they? I noticed you from our very first class‚Äîyou were sitting in the second row. I noticed you because of your appearance.""

On Thursday, in the car, I was sitting in the front seat wearing a short dress. He was cheerful, looking at me‚Äîeven at my knees. He asked if I had lost weight. 
And suddenly, I decided to invite him to my place once I moved: ""When I move into my new apartment and you are free, would you like to come over sometime and see‚Äîor critique‚Äîmy restored chandeliers?"".
He said, ""Why? You like them, don‚Äôt you?"" 
Then he abruptly changed the subject and started asking, ""Where is this new place? Is it close to your parents' house? When are you moving? Do your father and mother mind you moving out?""
 I said ""no"" and showed him where my new place was.  

There was a moment on Thursday when I told him that about a month ago, I had noticed he wore a really nice cologne for a few days, but I hadn‚Äôt smelled it on him since. The next day, on Friday, I caught a whiff of it again and said, ""I‚Äôm testing my sense of smell‚Äîis this that same cologne?""
 He replied, ""Yes."" 

On Friday, he looked incredibly handsome‚Äîhis shirt unbuttoned to the third button, revealing his beautiful, hairy chest. God. He definitely noticed me looking. He also often sat with his legs spread, and I‚Äôm sure he caught my glances there too. We laughed a lot, smiled, and he was telling me something when suddenly, out of nowhere, he started saying, ""Some people you can just admire‚Äîyou don‚Äôt necessarily have to have them."" Then he gestured at me and continued, ""These beautiful people are what make life worth living! I‚Äôve never understood fixating on just one person. If you feel it‚Äôs not mutual‚Äîlet them go, wish them well, and move on‚Ä¶ You‚Äôll still have so much ahead in life, you‚Äôll meet someone a thousand times better!"" 
I told him, ""That‚Äôs easy to say!"" 
He replied, ""Don‚Äôt pity yourself!""

I didn‚Äôt even understand how he shifted to this topic‚Äîwe weren‚Äôt even talking about us. After saying all that, he disappeared for an hour or two. 
When he came back, he acted like nothing had happened, and I told him, ""Thank you for saying that. Unspoken things have always weighed on me.""
 I couldn‚Äôt say anything else. 
But he kept asking, ""What words? Can you tell me what words? What did I say? I don‚Äôt even remember""
After a while, I brought it up again and asked, ""Then why did all of this even happen?"" 
And again, he replied, ""What are you talking about? What words? I don‚Äôt even understand what you mean.""

That day, he drove me home‚Äîapparently for the last time. 
We stopped at a store to buy cakes‚Äîhe wanted to get one for himself and one for me. But in the end, he didn‚Äôt buy one for himself and paid for mine instead, even though I didn‚Äôt want him to. 
He said, ""Don‚Äôt upset me, you‚Äôve already said enough.""

Then, in the car, he told me with a smile, ""You‚Äôve imagined things, you‚Äôve made things up in your head.""
 I smiled back and said, ""No, I‚Äôm not making things up, I‚Äôm not making things up.""
 We fell silent. But I was bursting inside. I told him, ""I‚Äôm not stupid‚Ä¶ but some things I just can‚Äôt explain.""
 He asked‚Äî""Like what?""‚Äîbut I stayed quiet. 
I didn‚Äôt have the strength to put everything between us into words. How could this have meant nothing to him? My God!!!  

I brought it up again and said, 
""No accusations, but why did all of this happen? What was any of it?"" 
He again claimed he didn‚Äôt understand what I meant. At the end of the ride, I said, ""I feel so emotionally drained for some reason‚Ä¶"". 
He stayed silent. When we said goodbye, he told me, ""I didn‚Äôt mean to say anything hurtful‚Äîif I did, I‚Äôm sorry. Goodbye."" And I said, ""Thank you anyway.""

There‚Äôs such a hole inside me now. I don‚Äôt believe he felt nothing.  
I‚Äôm sorry for such a long text. This is our whole story. And it ended so cruelly. The one thing I don‚Äôt understand is‚Äîwhy play with someone‚Äôs feelings like that? Was he really not emotionally involved at all?  ",1,1753616301.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

We've been together for 9 years now and I'm really starting to question wether we're right for eachother.

We don't share any interests and we're very different people. There's only a few topics he's able to talk about: His work, his political views/ideology, bodybuilding/steroids.

When it comes to interests, we don't like the same music, we can't even watch a movie we're both enthusiastic about because what he's interested in is very limited: war, world war 2, documentaries about war or about the universe. So I always need to force myself to watch something I'm not interested in just so that we could watch something together...and if we watch something I choose I'll listen to how stupid it is the entire time.
For an example, I like to watch anime and he keeps calling it ""that nonsense you watch"" and he even infatilises me sometimes saying that I'm a little girl watching cartoons.

When it comes to food all he's willing to eat is meat, potatoes and rice. Claims that vegetables are for rabbits and thinks that joke is so funny even though I heard it 100 times.
I like to cook and it sucks that most of the time I can't even cook what I want because he doesn't eat any vegetables (even if they're finely chopped/ blended and hidden in the sauce).

We basically can't do anything together and spend no quality time together because we just share nothing in common amd I find him sooo boring.

So as a result we just end up in different rooms doing our own things because what else am I supposed to do? I can't force myself to enjoy things I find boring anymore and he is not even willing to try my things because ""it's stupid"". 
Sometimes when we're both off work, with my morning coffee I like to have a conversation...but he's not interested in talking about anything else other than topics mentioned before. If I bring up some scientific study that clashes with his opinions, he will say that it's some sort of agenda and that those scientists are biased and lying. He thinks he knows better than anyone.

This is not a new thing, this is how he has always been since the beginning of our relationship, I don't want to change him, because this is who he is and has been his entire life. I just don't know if I can stay with him now that I'm noticing how miserable I am. I was just very young at the beginning of our relationship and I didn't know any better...I didn't know what relationships are supposed to look like and I thought it was normal. But after I passed the age of 25 it was as if something clicked in my brain and now I see things more clearly. I want a real connection, not someone who just lives with me and talks to me sometimes about stuff I don't care about...and I just don't know what to do.

I didn't realize I was anemic until a few weeks ago and started supplementing and trying to eat more iron immediately - but from what I've read, it'll still be a few weeks before my hair stops shedding and a few months before it actually starts regrowing.

My hair is very fine and was already pretty thin. I hate losing what little hair I have - so in the meantime I'm doing coffee rinses or adding instant coffee to my shampoo (usually every other day/every two days) and using hair masks on the rest of my hair to prevent as much loss from breakage as possible since so much is falling out straight from my scalp.

My thought is that caffeine can possibly stimulate growth, and a coffee rinse + letting it sit for 20 minutes isn't likely to hurt. I currently can't get a caffeine serum where I'm at right now (that might change in a few weeks, I'm backpacking SE Asia at the moment). 

I also just started using tretinoin and have been putting it on my hairline, and it seems to be actually regrowing some hair where I apply it! 

I sleep on a silk pillowcase and mostly keep my hair in one loose braid to protect it. To be honest I don't brush it much anymore because I can't stand how much hair comes out on the brush and I'm afraid it's actually pulling more hair out of my scalp even when I'm super gentle. (Since my hair is so fine/thin and I use a hair mask and keep it braided, it's not tangled)

**Material and Construction:** Cast iron tea kettles are primarily made from, as the name suggests, cast iron. The quality of the iron and the thickness of the casting considerably impact the kettle‚Äôs heat retention, durability, and resistance to rust. High-quality kettles frequently enough feature a protective enamel coating on the interior to prevent rust and make cleaning easier.The exterior may also be enameled or left with a traditional black finish.the best kettles are crafted with thick,uniform walls and a tight-fitting lid to minimize heat loss and ensure even heating. Look for kettles that feature integrated spouts, rather than attached ones, to reduce the risk of leaks.

**Heat Retention:** Cast iron's exceptional heat retention is one of its defining characteristics. Once heated, a cast iron kettle can keep water hot for extended periods, making it ideal for multiple servings of tea or for keeping water ready for various uses throughout the day. The specific heat retention capabilities depend on the thickness and quality of the cast iron.

Thicker cast iron will naturally retain heat for longer, allowing for more consistent water temperatures and convenient refills. This is notably beneficial for brewing delicate teas that require precise temperature control.

**Interior Coating:** To prevent rusting and impart no unwanted taste, many cast iron tea kettles feature an enamel coating on the interior. The quality of this enamel is crucial; it should be food-grade, durable, and resistant to chipping or cracking. Some kettles may use a different type of coating, such as a specially formulated sealant.

A high-quality enamel coating not onyl prevents rust but also simplifies cleaning and maintainance. It should be smooth and non-porous to prevent the buildup of tea stains and mineral deposits.

**Design and Aesthetics:** Cast iron tea kettles are available in a wide range of designs, from minimalist and modern to ornate and traditional. The aesthetic appeal is a significant consideration for many buyers,as these kettles often serve as decorative items in the kitchen or dining room. Common design elements include embossed patterns, textured surfaces, and a variety of colors.

Traditionally, tetsubin kettles from Japan feature elaborate designs inspired by nature or mythology. modern designs may incorporate clean lines, bold colors, and ergonomic handles for a more contemporary look.

**Handle and Lid Design:** The handle and lid of a cast iron tea kettle are critical for safety and usability. The handle should be pleasant to grip, even when the kettle is full and hot. Many handles are coated with a heat-resistant material or feature a pivoting design to keep them cool to the touch.

The lid should fit snugly to prevent leakage and heat loss. Some lids have integrated steam vents or knob handles for easy removal. Look for a kettle with a well-designed handle and lid that prioritizes both comfort and safety.

Key features of cast iron teapots include:

* Superior heat retention
* Durable construction
* Rust-resistant coating
* Aesthetic design
* Safe and comfortable handle

1majtec,https://www.reddit.com/r/gout/comments/1majtec/uric_acid_level_of_88_and_a_lot_of_confusion_and/,Uric acid level of 8.8 and a lot of confusion and worries...,"So I posted here before but that was just a venting post that was way too long for people to read. Deleted that but some questions still remain, some got answered but other I am unsure of.

So long story short, took a blood test just out of an feeling my things weren't going great (initial worries was diabetes type 2).  
There are some things outside of a high uric acid level, but for now I will just state things as they are relevant for here sorted by points, hopefully this makes things easier to read.

**Gout wise:**

Never had it, at least from what I hearing.  
I do have like some joint pains here and there, but mostly in my right hand due to execisse gaming.  
When I cross my legs they go numb easily, I do have some pain in my right leg that sometimes feels heavier but that comes and goes and its not ankel directly.  
My doctor gave me a panthlet and warned me of having gout, but its not directly explaining particularly food that I should and shouldn't avoid other than the obvious.

**Numbers wise:**

Uric Acid level is at 8.8. as stated before  
I weigh 120kg, with a height of roughly 180-183 (messurement was weird to take).

**Activitiy wise:**

I am 22 years old, I have started gaining weight for some time now, starting properly around 2020, a lot probably between 2022-2024, as I was jobless there and would basically not go outside at all much and play videogames a lot, not moving much at all.  
I have began being more active since starting to work again in January (though gotta see how the contract goes).  
I work at a library, ironically at a medical university, I move and sort in boxes and books a lot for at least an hour or half an hour daily, but generally I don't move that much per say, as I still sit around in my office frequently.

**Diet wise:**

Ate meat my entire life so far daily, nomatter what really, mostly for lunch and evening, definitely in higher amounts than a healthy diet would want you to.  
Love food in general so its not like I just hate vegetables or anything.  
Junk food definitely ended up a lot more in my system this year with more money at hand to order stuff, kebab, burger, pizza etc. though I honestly am pretty willing to give it up since it barely tasted good anymore.  
Drank redbull here and there at mornings in the past months when I needed a jolt.  
Generally I always have a bottle of mineral water a day or more.  
At work there is a mensa that offers meat and vegetarian dishes, salad bar etc. I tended to basically go for the meat options always, with a big glass of apple juice.  
Sweets and cookies were a pretty frequent thing, either next to lunch as desert since they offer that as well, or next to me at home was always a package.  
Since the beginning of last week I did end up switching up what I eat, avoiding stuff thats unhealthy, but did still end up eating things that at point were bad for my uric acid (canned tuna, baked fish, chicken).  
I did hold on coffee, not sure why, I never sweeten it, but I think I kinda knew my anxiety would get worse with it.  
Still drank water, ate some almonds instead of cookies and fruit & yogurt in the morning for breakfast.

**Alcohol and smoking:**

I don't smoke anymore, but did a bit between roughly october 2023 and october 2024. It was a one or two cigarretes a day usually, not at weekends for the most part. Since then have maybe smoked once or twice at the start of my new work but not anymore,  
Alcohol is an up and down for me.  
A couple years ago I would drink and jack and coke mixed cans at saturdays, 2-4 whilst gaming. Stopped that for a couple of months to year, drank again, had a bad hangover, didn't drink for months, drank again on weekends irregularly, had a bad hangover.  
Didn't drink much at all before work, then there was a birthday party within my first month or so where I got pretty drunk, which did get me to drink more again, on another birthday party later and for a view weeks-months(?) now regularly apple cider 4 pack or more and/or campari/aperol with orange juice at fridays and saturdays, particularly would eat badly beforehand to counteract a hangover.

**Mental issues**:

Not fully relevant to here but maybe worth mentioning.  
Have ADHD and/or Autism, didn't test in a while.  
General depression and mood swings (likely due to my Vitamin D defiecency I am getting treated for).  
Hypohondriac tenedcies, nothing official but basically once I suspect I have something I always think I have the worst case scenario.  
Currently also have issues with my vision that make it neigh impossible to not think of anything bad.

**Goals now on:**

Not much else to say other than lose weight being sort of a thing, which has been a frustrating thing for me in a while but I basically gotta lock in now by look of it.

**Now general thing I am confused by in regard to managing UA and preventing Gout:**

1. Should I avoid any read meat and seafood like the plague, or can I have a dish that includes those things at the end of the week or month? (This would be good to avoid frustrations and have sort of rewards to look forward to). Is frequent eating of chicken thats not fried okay?
2. I am generally confused about the whole thing, if it means I basically have gout automatically that is waiting to attack or if I have just Hyperuricemia and I am not as close to getting it as I worry about. (Some people here answered it but I am just stating it again, I do believe I just have the one for now)
3. I am kind of scared of falling into traps in terms of food I think might be good that apparently aren't. Examples of that were lentils, beans, mushrooms, fish and spinach but I am also seeing that oranges were on the list of things I should avoid on the panthlet my doctor gave me. If I eat say a banana and orange every day for breakfast would this end up being more counterproductive? What about a fruit creal bar? Are protein bars okay?
4. I ended up getting some montomercy cherries capsules, when asking for something again hyperuricema. I also heard this could trigger a gout attack, though I took 2-3 now and nothing happened, still asking just in case.
5. This is probably a lot more of a stupid question, but I am wondering if like, I may have ""Offset"" some stuff in my life. Like I said, I do drink a lot of water all things considered, not really into soda much at all other than the stuff I mentioned about lunch and I do just sometimes like to eat lemons. The idea with this question is mainly that perhaps I ended up getting lucky and it could have been a lot worse overall. Not that I plan on not improving that but still.

I think this is most of my immediatly question, concern and thoughts overall, I could need some advice and will try to look at the subbreddit but note: **I do not want to take allopurinol for the rest of my life,** unless something comes out soon (getting to an ultrasound test of liver and kidney).",2,1753615170.0,gout,1,1.0,False

The place has a calm, open vibe with minimalist interiors, lots of natural light, and a peaceful setup perfect for working, catching up, or just zoning out with a good book and a cup of coffee.

What really stole the show for me was their baked lasagna (check out the pics üòã) ‚Äì perfectly cheesy, loaded with flavor, and paired with that crunchy grilled garlic bread. Everything tasted fresh and comforting. Portions were generous too!

If you're someone who enjoys a chilled-out space with solid food and aesthetic interiors, this place is a must-visit. Definitely adding it to my go-to list in Vizag.

Wanted to share some good news and get your take ‚Äî especially from those more experienced in international relationships.

I‚Äôm a 29-year-old guy from the U.S. who started using the Boo App about a year ago. Most conversations with women from outside the States fizzled after a few days ‚Äî nice chats, but no lasting connection.

Then I met her ‚Äî a 26-year-old lawyer from Honduras. Beautiful, sharp, kind. We started texting daily, which quickly turned into regular video and phone calls. We‚Äôve now been talking consistently for almost 10 months ‚Äî every single day.

In May, she surprised me.
She asked if she could send me something. What showed up was more than just a care package ‚Äî it was a box filled with her favorite Honduran snacks, some great local coffee, and best of all: a hand-crafted leather wallet stuffed with pictures of her. (Funny enough, I actually needed a new wallet but never mentioned it.)

We‚Äôre finally meeting in person this January.
I planned a weeklong trip to Costa Rica and booked a resort ‚Äî around $4,000 for the room. When I sent her the itinerary, she was a little upset ‚Äî not because she didn‚Äôt want to go, but because she thought it was too much money. She told me she‚Äôd be just as happy in a cheap hotel as long as we were together. I explained that I can comfortably afford it without dipping into savings or retirement, and that this trip is important to me. She eventually accepted it, but it showed me her mindset ‚Äî she‚Äôs not here for the money.

Looking ahead, I invited her to the U.S. next July for my family reunion.
She was excited ‚Äî really excited ‚Äî and immediately started working with a visa agency to increase her chances of approval. And here‚Äôs the kicker: she‚Äôs paying for the whole process herself. Never asked me for a dime.

Here‚Äôs why this feels so different from anything I‚Äôve experienced in the States:
	‚Ä¢	She‚Äôs affectionate and consistent ‚Äî I never feel like I‚Äôm begging for attention, love, or basic respect.
	‚Ä¢	She‚Äôs family-oriented and constantly tells me how much she looks forward to meeting mine.
	‚Ä¢	She‚Äôs patient with our Spanglish conversations and works hard to understand me.
	‚Ä¢	She‚Äôs supportive of my career and understands that if things get serious, we‚Äôll need to be based in the U.S.
	‚Ä¢	Her sister is married to an Italian and lives in Europe, so she has some perspective on cross-cultural relationships and being far from home.

Compared to my ex-wife (American), it‚Äôs night and day. With her, I always felt like I was walking on eggshells or auditioning for love. This new relationship feels mutual ‚Äî calm, supportive, and real.

‚∏ª

So here‚Äôs where I‚Äôd love your input:
	1.	Am I missing any red flags?
She‚Äôs never asked for money. She doesn‚Äôt seem eager to leave her home or chase a green card. She has a good job, strong family ties in Honduras, and seems grounded. Still ‚Äî I want to be cautious and smart.
	2.	Is July 2026 a realistic timeline for a B-2 tourist visa?
She‚Äôs just starting the process now. The goal is for her to visit for a week, meet my family, and experience the U.S. Does this timeline make sense? Are there ways to strengthen her application?
	3.	Are there any steps I should be taking now to protect myself or move things forward in a smart way?
Any lessons learned, paperwork tips, or cultural hurdles I should expect?

Thanks in advance for the insight, brothers ‚Äî and wishing safe travels and good fortune to all of you chasing love and adventure beyond the borders.",9,1753615068.0,thepassportbros,36,0.76,False

As someone who's done several Hawaii tours before, this one stands out as the most comprehensive way to see the island's highlights in a single day.

I booked through this link (https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island) and the whole process was smooth. The tour picks you up early from Waikiki hotels, which lets you maximize your day exploring. Our guide was incredibly knowledgeable about Hawaiian culture and history, making every stop meaningful.

The first major stop was Diamond Head, where we got those postcard-perfect photos of the coastline. The Halona Blowhole was next - if you're lucky, you'll see it shoot water 30 feet high! The Nu'uanu Pali Lookout gave us breathtaking views of the windward coast, and our guide shared fascinating stories about King Kamehameha's historic battle there.

One unexpected highlight was the Tropical Farms stop. We sampled fresh Kona coffee and macadamia nuts (trust me, you'll want to buy some to take home). The Kualoa Regional Park view was surreal - you'll recognize it from Jurassic Park and other movies.

The North Shore portion was fantastic. We stopped at famous surf spots like Sunset Beach, and got to try the legendary garlic shrimp from the food trucks (bring cash for lunch - it's worth it). 

The crown jewel was Waimea Valley. The botanical garden walk leads to a stunning 45-foot waterfall where you can swim. Bring your swimsuit - it's a unique experience you won't want to miss. Pro tip: pack water shoes if you have them.

Our final stop at Dole Plantation was perfect for grabbing that famous Dole Whip ice cream. Throughout the day, our guide shared insider tips and stories that you won't find in guidebooks.

A few practical notes:
- The tour runs about 8 hours
- They provide comfortable, air-conditioned transport
- Group size is manageable (max 24 people)
- All entrance fees are included
- They offer free cancellation up to 24 hours before

The tour costs $154 per person, which is great value considering everything that's included. I've seen similar tours charging much more.

I highly recommend booking in advance through this link: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island. Tours often fill up, especially during peak season.

What makes this tour special is how it balances the must-see spots with hidden gems that most tourists miss. You get a real sense of Oahu's diversity - from bustling beaches to serene valleys, historic sites to natural wonders.

In my opinion, if you're planning to explore Oahu and want to make the most of your time, this tour is your best bet. It's particularly great for first-time visitors who want to see the island's highlights without the hassle of rental cars and navigation.",1,1753614700.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a game that‚Äôs as predictable as a toddler‚Äôs naptime: the Chicago Cubs, armed with a baseball-sized ego and a second-place MLB offense (5.3 runs per game), take on the Chicago White Sox, who score like a team that‚Äôs been told ‚Äúnumbers are for the birds.‚Äù The White Sox, 27th in runs per game (3.8) and 38-66 on the season, are underdogs at +162, which means bookmakers think their chances of winning are roughly equivalent to me napping through a coffee lecture on quantum physics. The Cubs, meanwhile, are favored at -162, implying an 8.3% edge in a match that‚Äôs less ‚Äúupset alert‚Äù and more ‚ÄúCubs fans sipping champagne while the White Sox sip lukewarm Gatorade.‚Äù

**Parsing the Odds: Why the Cubs Are the Financially Responsible Choice**  
Let‚Äôs crunch some numbers like a catcher cradling a line drive to the chest. The Cubs‚Äô offense is a well-oiled machine, led by Kyle Tucker‚Äôs 103 hits, a .383 OBP, and a .491 slugging percentage that makes him the closest thing to a baseball superhero since *The Sandlot*‚Äôs The Wall. Meanwhile, the White Sox rely on Miguel Vargas‚Äô 12 home runs, which is admirable‚Ä¶ if your goal is to win a ‚Äúmost dramatic last-ditch effort‚Äù award. Statistically, the Cubs have a 92.9% win rate when favored by -193 or shorter, while the White Sox? A paltry 27.7% as underdogs of +162 or more. In betting terms, it‚Äôs like choosing between a guaranteed sandwich and a 1-in-4 chance of getting a participation trophy.

The White Sox‚Äôs starting pitcher, Sean Burke, is tasked with outdueling‚Ä¶ well, a mystery starter for the Cubs. Chicago‚Äôs lack of an announced pitcher is less ‚Äústrategic‚Äù and more ‚Äúthey hid their ace in a closet and forgot the combination.‚Äù Conversely, the Cubs‚Äô recent four-game losing streak is a blip compared to their 60-43 record‚Äîa hiccup smaller than aÂ©¥Â≠©‚Äôs sneeze in a hospital.

So my wife, who is his biological daughter btw, tried to stop him but was told to shut up. That was my first trigger warning as I didn‚Äôt rly appreciate how he sounded. 

I kept silent for a while and continued as a bystander standpoint and the scolding and fault finding persisted. That‚Äôs when I tried to intervene , thinking we can bring this quarrel back home instead of dealing with it here. Spoke in a normal tone but was told to shut up by him as well. 

Thats when something in me just snapped. I retaliated by shouting at him, to get his attention focused on me, and trying to reason with him. But it didn‚Äôt work out, and I was held back by both my wife and MIL for being the ‚Äòaggressor‚Äô

¬†He walked to the edge of the building.¬† He stood atop one of the taller apartment buildings just south of Soho, none of the surrounding buildings blocked his view of the wall of skyscrapers before him as he looked north to midtown.¬† South, the towering financial centers of Wall Street and the Freedom Tower stood behind him, shining brightly.¬† He was surrounded by thousands of twinkling lights.

¬†He looked down.¬† About three hundred feet down, people went about their daily business, hurrying to work, heading out for dinner, meeting a date...

¬†He could jump if he wanted to, and that would be the end of it.¬† All of his headaches and misery could be ended by a simple step forward, and single hop, and within seconds, it would all be over.

¬†Peering through his scope, he sought out her building.¬† She lived just ten blocks north.¬† Her building wasn‚Äôt particularly tall, but from where he was standing, he could clearly see into her home, just a small twinkling light among the sea of thousands.¬†

¬†He watched as she sat on the couch, playing with her phone.¬† Was she texting?¬† Swiping right on some new guy?¬† She was smiling.¬† While he was standing at the edge of the roof, seriously thinking about jumping, she was sitting there, not thinking about anyone else.

¬†Did she ever think of him?¬† He assumed she didn‚Äôt.¬† Why would she?¬† They had gone out only once.¬† They had met at a small sushi place in the East Village after finding each other on one of the dating apps.¬† She had been nice.¬† She smiled as he told her about his family.

¬†He hadn‚Äôt intended on following her ‚Äì it just happened.¬† He watched head bob back and forth as she walked briskly through the crowds.¬† He played over their conversation in his head, trying to find out where he had gone wrong.¬† Was it something he had said?¬† He couldn‚Äôt imagine anything offensive.¬† Maybe he had seemed presumptuous when he said that next time they would try Italian?¬†

After a few blocks, he stopped at the corner and watched her turn into her building.¬† He knew he wasn‚Äôt a handsome man, but he wasn‚Äôt anything to run from.¬† Certainly there were men much uglier than him walking around with girls on their arms.¬† She was pretty, but not so much so that she deserved to stand on some pedestal, looking down at him.¬†

How could she sit there and laugh, texting furiously into her phone?¬† He watched as she giggled, pounding her thumbs into the phone screen.¬†

What should I do now?","I like a guy he‚Äôs my senior we rarely talked. At first I wasn‚Äôt interested in him but with time i started liking him. Our mutuals told me that he‚Äôs interested cause we‚Äôve been talking for 2 months now and he usually doesn‚Äôt talk to girls. He replies within a day and sometimes after few days. He told me hes been burnt out lately so hes not much in talking but randomly we had a talk on the call for 6 hours and then chatted till morning 10am.

(Idk i had a long crush on this guy but one incident made me hate him cause once i asked him if I could take a picture of him for some project, we hit it off nicely and the next day i tried greeting him and he ignored me, so i hated him when i entered university) and now i finally get to talk to him and mostly him replying to my stories. I feel uneasy, unsure about his feelings obviously i cant ask since i feel like he called me talked about his friends and shared his stories that he considers me as a good friend but he‚Äôs invested too much. Because he started approaching me, talking to me every time he saw me in university altho i was clearly uninterested).

lol. Moving forward to next few days, I dropped him a message to contact me asap cause i wanted some info, He called. It turned into a 2 hour call. I was bout to drop the call but he kept the convo going. He then asked me if i wanna go watch a movie with him.

We went to watch the movie but sadly the cinema was full and no seats were available so we decided to go and grab coffee cause he was craving for it. He offered me a bike ride but i wasn‚Äôt comfortable so we booked an uber and went to grab coffee. He asked me if he could smoke and i was ok with it, we drank coffee, (i even tried his with his own straw which i don‚Äôt usually do and i told him that). I even told him that i usually dont wear lipgloss but I wore it today and he said he knows???? Why does he know that. later we walked and just talked about families our lore random here and there talks.

More to that when i got home, he called me and asked if i got home and he asked to bare him until he gets himself some ice cream. He kept yapping about the place he usually hangs out with his friends. He said that he kept his phone inside his helmet and he‚Äôs talking to me. Even while meeting his friends he was on the call so i was like we can talk later u meet ur friends and we ended our 15 minutes call, to him saying thank you for meeting me i had fun and making my day better, lets do this again.


He even told me that he replies late cause when hes out he doesnt use  his phone which is true because the time he spent with me he didnt open up his phone. Its been a week he hasnt replied to be or is active on socials, he‚Äôs barely active. Literally once a week, posts smth and leaves.

1majfa2,https://i.redd.it/p8i920m2eeff1.png,Rebirth And Revenge: The Betrayed Luna's Return,"I‚Äôll kill you

The cold hard floor bit into Eleanor's skin, making her battered body shiver. But neither the cold nor the bruises on her body were enough to make her admit a crime she hadn't committed.



Thomas, her husband, could keep her locked up for however long, but she would not budge until she revealed Mia's deception.



If only Thomas would listen to her side of the story. They had been together for many years and married for three. How could he believe Mia when she accused Eleanor of killing his unborn child?



Didn't he know her at all? If he did, he would know she was not capable of such evil. Was he so blind to his lover's schemes that he would be willing to treat her, who had been by his side since they were teens, like this?



Eleanor had thought that he would be on her side. That he would try to at least look into the matter. But the moment Mia accused her of causing her miscarriage, he and everyone else in the pack believed she was guilty.



They accused her of being jealous of Mia, who had been able to do what she couldn't in the three years she had been Luna‚Äîconceive an heir. No matter how much she pleaded her innocence, Thomas had her whipped and locked in the cell, awaiting trial.



She never would have imagined that they would come to this. Was he the same person she had grown up with? He had been her best friend as kids, then as teenagers, they started dating.



Eleanor was sad to find out that they were not fated mates when she had her first shift at eighteen, but it didn't matter. They still loved each other. They stayed with each other and got married three years ago when Thomas inherited the Alpha.



Together, they ruled the Blackstorm pack as Alpha and Luna. But all that was now on the line because her husband decided to trust another person over her.



The sound of footsteps reached her from outside the cell. After a few seconds, Thomas appeared on the other side of the metal bars. His Beta, Miller, was with him.



Eleanor sprang from her position on the floor. Pain intensified all over her body, but it didn't stop her from rushing to the door.



""Thomas, you have to believe me! She is lying. I would never do that and you know it!""



Her husband looked at her with a cold expression, his dark eyes like shards of ice. He had never looked at her like that, like he didn't care about her at all. Like she was a stranger.



""Grace,"" Eleanor said, wrapping her hands around the metal bars of the cell door. Grace was her servant, who had served her for a long time. ""Call Grace and ask her about it. She knows I had nothing to do with Mia's miscarriage.""



If Thomas wouldn't believe her, Grace was her only other option. Grace took care of most of her affairs while she was busy running the pack. She knew her movements more than anyone else, perhaps even more than Thomas.



""Is that so?"" Thomas asked. ""Let's hear what she has to say, then.""



Eleanor breathed a sigh of relief. Grace would vouch for her and she would have a chance to prove her innocence.



Thomas sent word for Grace and she showed up a few moments later. With her was Mia. Eleanor ignored her and focused on Grace.



""Grace, tell him that I didn't do it,"" she pleaded.



Grace looked at her then at Thomas. ""Alpha,"" she began, ""it was Luna Eleanor who instructed me to put abortion drugs in Mia's coffee."" She knelt down. ""Please forgive me, Alpha. I didn't have a choice. I'm just an Omega, and Luna threatened to harm my family if I didn't follow her instructions.""



""What?"" Eleanor whispered in disbelief as she listened to her servants' words. ""What are you saying? No, I never gave you such instructions!""



""You said you couldn't stand that she was pregnant with Alpha's child and you feared she would replace you as Luna."" Grace slowly raised her head and looked at Eleanor. Her eyes filled with fear and guilty. ""Sorry, Luna, I have to tell the truth. I have nightmares every night. It must be the Moon Goddess blaming me kill the Alpha's heir.""



Eleanor was struck speechless. Why would Grace lie about that? Her eyes moved to Mia. She was standing behind Thomas, so he couldn't see the smirk on her face.



The witch! She must have bribed Grace to lie about it.



Eleanor screamed, pulling the metal bars crazily, ""She's lying too! They're all liars! Thomas, please‚Äî""



""Enough!"" Thomas cut in.



His face now darkened with anger, and he reached through the bars and wrapped his hand around Eleanor's neck.



Eleanor was weak from the earlier whipping and could barely fight against his hold.



""Miller,"" Thomas called his Beta. His voice was cold and firm. ""Set the execution for tomorrow.""



With a second hesitation, Miller lowered his head and answered, ""Yes Alpha.""



Thomas shoved Eleanor and she fell to the floor. ""Let's go,"" he said, turning to Mia and offering her his hand.



""No,"" Eleanor wheezed through her bruised throat. ""Thomas, please. Don't do this. She is lying. They are both lying.""



""Thomas..."" Mia suddenly stopped. She looked at Thomas and demanded, ""There's something I must say to her.""



""Are you sure? After what she did‚Äî""



Mia shook her head and give him a soft smile. The smile everyone had fallen for. ""It's fine. She cannot harm me anymore.""



Thomas nodded, then kissed her on the forehead before leaving with Miller and Grace. Mia stood at the door, looking down at Eleanor. ""Finally, I can get rid of you.""



With everybody gone, she was revealing her true colours. Colours that everybody around them couldn't see.



""I'll not let you get away with this,"" Eleanor swore.



Mia laughed. ""You still think you have a way out? Tomorrow, you'll be gone. Dead. Out of my way. How exactly are you going to make me pay?""



Eleanor grinded her teeth together. When Grace lied, she lost her chance to prove her innocence. Thomas already ordered her execution. She was doomed.



Mia touched her belly and sneered, ""How does it feel that he trusts me more than you? How would he feel if he knew this wasn't even his child?""



""What?!""



Mia's smile grew bigger. ""That's right. The father is a rogue. But it doesn't matter, does it? This child is going to make me Luna of Blackstorm. At least I could give him an heir, unlike you.""



Eleanor got to her feet. ""You are crazy. When he finds out‚Äî""



""How will he find out? Even if you were to tell him right now, do you think he would believe you? He would think you are desperate, cooking up stories to save your skin.""



""I should have never let you stay,"" Eleanor said.



""It's too late for regrets,"" Mia told her. ""I'm Thomas's fated mate. You should never have clinged to him. He never belonged to you. And that's why I made sure you never gave him an heir.""



Eleanor's face creased in confusion. ""What?""



""You have always thought of Grace as your loyal servant, haven't you? It didn't take long to convince her to work for me. She has been poisoning your food all along so you would never conceive. And now, my efforts have paid off. Soon, I'll be the Luna of Blackstorm, and I'll have Thomas all to myself.""



Hearing her words, Eleanor's teeth trembled uncontrollably. She never imagined that her infertility was not her own flaw, but a trap set by Mia! When Mia first arrived at this pack, Eleanor showed tolerance towards this Omega. She sympathized with Mia's suffering, knowing that Omegas in the werewolf world endure immense pain to survive, despite that she had to accept Mia as the other woman for Thomas.



For the sake of strengthening the pack, Eleanor allowed Mia to stay.



Eleanor broke down. She could no longer control her anger. ""I'll kill you,"" she screamed, tightening her grip on Mia's neck.



""Ah! Thomas! Eleanor is trying to kill me... Help!"" Mia cried out in pain, drawing Thomas's attention.



Before Eleanor could explain, she saw Thomas's angry gaze shooting towards her, and in the next moment, his fist came crashing into her stomach.



Eleanor felt like her heart had been pierced. Why? Why did he trust Mia so much, and not his own Luna?



Was this really the end for her?

1majf8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckNestle/comments/1majf8h/nestl√©_the_gold_standard_of_corporate_rot_in/,"Nestl√©: The Gold Standard of Corporate Rot, In Every Way But Returns","If there‚Äôs one company that embodies the full range of corporate soullessness, it‚Äôs Nestl√©. The scandals practically run on a conveyor belt. Water privatization in drought-ridden areas, exploitative cocoa sourcing practices, tone-deaf marketing in vulnerable regions, Nestl√© has hit every square on the Business Ethics Bingo card, and then printed new cards just to keep the game going.

Of course, there's the newer stuff too, such as the recent melodrama at the executive level - a tangled internal romance that would be tasteless even by HBO standards, but somehow fits perfectly with a company that already makes bottled water feel like an act of moral compromise. One starts to wonder if the boardroom runs on spreadsheets or just bad decisions steeped in Nespresso.

They‚Äôve managed the incredible feat of doing everything wrong and still claiming the ESG badge like it‚Äôs a cereal box prize. Every time a Nestl√© product is rebranded as ‚Äúsustainable,‚Äù somewhere, a tree dies of irony. This is a company that takes criticism the way it takes natural resources: aggressively, unapologetically, and with just enough PR spin to keep the worst of it out of the investor presentation slides.

And yet, despite all this relentless moral erosion, they still can‚Äôt seem to deliver where it actually matters.

I mean, if you're going to be the poster child for corporate overreach, the least you could do is reward shareholders for enduring the reputational whiplash. But no - Nestl√©‚Äôs performance over the past stretch has been a masterclass in disappointment. While other morally flexible companies have been printing money, Nestl√© has shuffled sideways like a confused pensioner. Every earnings report reads like an apology, delivered through gritted teeth and Swiss accounting.

It‚Äôs genuinely impressive: the only major multinational to combine shameless ethics with subpar returns. At least Big Oil offers a nice dividend. At least tech monopolies pump up a chart now and then. But Nestl√©? Nestl√© gives you the moral burden and a sagging portfolio. A perfect encapsulation of modern inefficiency. I've literally had a lost decade in this shit stock and am down 12%. 

There‚Äôs a certain honesty to it, I suppose. They‚Äôve commodified everything else - why not underperformance?

Anyway. Here we are. Another quarter, another press release that says a lot and means nothing. The planet burns, the scandals pile up, and my shares sit there like a stale wafer in a boardroom coffee tray.

Disgraceful. But you already knew that.

...but hey, you only ever really lose when you sell, and until then I'll keep getting my free food from the shareholder meetings every.single.year!

**Zones:**  
It has three sections - the regular section, the family dining section which is a little cosier and an open smoking zone. Each zone has its own aesthetic, with wicker chairs for the open area and soft cushioned seats for the regular and family areas. 

**Aesthetic:**  
Okay-okay for clicking pictures. The cafe counter is large with a big chalkboard containing the coffee menu and other drinks written in colourful chalk and cutesy scrawls. Loved the theme. 

**Staff:**  
The staff is polite and polished. They, along with the cafe owner Salman Bhai, even helped me figure out PGs and hostels in the area and gave me contact info, safety tips and so on. Really helpful. They even let me click pictures of the counter.

**Food:**  
AMAZING. Worth every single rupee charged. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad, garlic bread, crispy chicken wrap and a Cafe Mocha. The quantity is plenty, and the quality is great. The Caesar salad was loaded with chicken chunks. The garlic bread was well-made. The crispy chicken wrap sold it for me - flavourful chicken wrapped into a perfectly toasted tortilla.

Been thinking lately that some of my best weekend spins are the ones with a specific mission: finding a great cup of coffee. Whether it's a blast down to Wicklow and finding a little gem of a caf√©, or just cruising around the city on a Saturday morning, it just makes the ride better.

I was wondering if there‚Äôs any interest in starting an informal, regular-ish group for this?

The idea would be super simple:

* Maybe one Saturday or Sunday a month to start.
* Pick a cool coffee spot in Dublin or the surrounding counties (Wicklow, Kildare, Meath etc.).
* Meet up, have a coffee and a chat, and then maybe go for a decent spin afterwards.
* Absolutely no club politics, no fees, no official membership. Just turn up if you're free.

Full disclosure, I'm a bit obsessed with the bikes-and-beans combination. I've spent the better part of a year building my own little coffee trailer that gets towed by my motorcycle.

1majc5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInReviews/comments/1majc5s/examine_the_blackdecker_to1475ssd_toaster_oven/,Examine the BLACK+DECKER TO1475SSD Toaster Oven for Delicious Results!,"As someone who finds themselves in the kitchen multiple times a day, I recently had the chance to get hands-on with the BLACK+DECKER TO1475SSD, a compact yet capable toaster oven. I‚Äôve used it for everything from quick toast in the morning to testing frozen mozzarella sticks for a late-night snack, so this review comes from genuine daily use. Though this appliance ticks plenty of boxes, it does have some quirks worth mentioning.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The stainless steel design of this toaster oven immediately grabbed my attention‚Äîit‚Äôs sleek and blends well in my kitchen alongside modern appliances. The compact size is great if you‚Äôre short on counter space, and at just 9.7 x 15.5 x 8.25 inches, it fits snugly between my coffee maker and blender without feeling cramped. The drop-down door feels sturdy and opens smoothly, which is definitely a plus when you‚Äôre juggling hot pans. However, the knob-based controls felt a little retro (or dare I say, basic), and I found myself wishing for a digital interface, given how many small appliances are going that route.  

**Cooking Performance**  
Since I‚Äôm frequently experimenting with recipes, I put the natural convection heating to the test. True to its claims, the airflow system delivers even cooking results. Toasting bread yielded a consistent golden brown, unlike my older toaster oven, which left one side conspicuously darker. Baking pizza was another moment of revelation‚Äîthe 9-inch pizza fit snugly in the oven, and the crust came out crispy without being overdone. Even using the broil function on cheese-topped casseroles provided impressive results. Nevertheless, adjustments to the default temperature settings were often needed for more precise results, especially with delicate items like homemade pastries.

[Check BLACK+DECKER TO1475SSD price on Amazon.](https://appliancedirectory.com/p/b0c7wm2lql/)

**Cooking Versatility**  
The four cooking functions‚Äîbake, broil, toast, and keep warm‚Äîoffer sufficient range for most casual cooking tasks. I tested the ‚Äúkeep warm‚Äù setting with leftover pasta, and it worked like a charm to reheat without drying the sauce. However, for more advanced home cooks or those diving into more ambitious baking projects, the limited control knob settings might feel a bit bare-bones. This toaster oven is perfect for simple tasks but wouldn‚Äôt replace a full-size oven for larger family meals or more involved cooking endeavors.  

**Included Accessories**  
The inclusion of a broil rack and bake pan was appreciated. They feel solid and fit perfectly in the oven, leaving no awkward gaps or wobbly positioning. I‚Äôve used the bake pan for cookies, mini casseroles, and even to catch drippings while roasting vegetables. While these accessories worked well for their size, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel restricted; I often found myself wishing there were a few additional pans optimized for this oven‚Äôs interior dimensions.

**Strengths**  
‚Ä¢ Compact and stylish stainless steel design  
‚Ä¢ Effective natural convection system for even cooking  
‚Ä¢ Versatile cooking options: bake, broil, toast, and keep warm  
‚Ä¢ Included broil rack and bake pan add convenience  

**Drawbacks**  
‚Ä¢ Analog knobs feel dated compared to digital options  
‚Ä¢ Small interior limits batch size or larger meals  
‚Ä¢ Manual adjustments needed for more consistent baking precision  

**Competing Products**  
When it comes to other toaster ovens within a similar price range, the Hamilton Beach Easy Reach and Ninja SP101 come to mind. The Hamilton Beach model offers a unique roll-top door, which adds an extra level of convenience in cramped spaces, but it lacks the polished stainless steel aesthetic. The Ninja SP101, however, brings digital controls and more cooking functions, including air frying, though it comes at a higher price point. Compared to these, the BLACK+DECKER excels in cooking basic items efficiently thanks to its natural convection system, but it trails slightly in terms of advanced features and cooking capacity.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Considering the overall performance and design, I would say this toaster oven is a solid choice for its price. It offers excellent functionality for daily cooking needs, particularly for someone in a small household or a student living in an apartment. Paying for a premium model with additional bells and whistles doesn't seem necessary if your primary goal is evenly cooked food without breaking the bank. While it may not be the ultimate solution for larger families or gourmet chefs, it strikes an excellent balance between price and practicality.

Sharing my journey + the things that helped me most in case they help anyone else (go to the bottom for tips)!


Day 1:
I woke up from anesthesia with zero nausea or vomiting which I had been terrified about. I prepared for days before by hydrating like crazy (2‚Äì3L daily for 3‚Äì4 days), and I really believe that helped with the IV placement, during pre-op easy examinations and in post-op healing, since I‚Äôm not drinking that much water in general. I did feel some stomach discomfort after the operation, but it turned out to just be gas from the type of surgery, not nausea. Mostly slept, stayed quiet, and had little bites of yogurt, jelly, and ice cream.
Pain: ~3/10, very manageable.

Day 2: 
Way more intense. My uvula and tongue were so swollen, it triggered uncontrollable muscle tightness, gag reflex, and a near-panic attack. I was terrified I couldn‚Äôt breathe or swallow.
Saw my ENT just to be safe and he reassured me everything looked ‚Äúgreat, not just good.‚Äù He prescribed a small dose of Xanax to calm my nervous system, which honestly helped a lot. Still no pain meds yet - surprisingly, pain remained manageable without anything. The mental part was harder than the physical this day. 


Day 3: 
Pain still feels like a typical tonsillitis flare-up. I‚Äôm being very careful with what I eat and taking prebiotic capsules instead of yogurt to avoid dairy coating while still supporting my gut.
Had some light nausea earlier but walking around and staying upright helped. Still very nervous about Days 5-8 because of all the horror stories I‚Äôve read about bleeding üò¨ Also I‚Äôm talking nearly all the time cause my mom insists that I should keep my throat moving as per usual, which is of course not achievable but strangely enough I think it helped me overall on throat tightness. Ofc I sound like Shakira on Marlboro. 

Day 4:
I experienced a noticeable increase in sharp throat pain today (~6/10), which started radiating into my ears: it feels a lot like that pressure you get during airplane landing. Despite that, I‚Äôm still completely free of nausea (huge win for me), and I‚Äôve only needed less than half doses of my painkillers so far (1500mg paracetamol per DAY). Holding steady with hydration, soft foods, rest and chamomile tea! I‚Äôm not taking ibuprofen at all cause I‚Äôm going crazy over bleeding possibility ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

Day 5:
Today even yogurt was challenging for me. It feels like a drop of lemon on a scratch‚Ä¶ Milk pudding was ultra gentle though and I managed to eat some rice. I got some metallic taste in my mouth here and there which made me nervous but no trace of blood found. I‚Äôm still on steroids cause my uvula and soft palate are still swollen. Hunger is back but it‚Äôs the most difficult day so far to eat solids. Pain lvl ~7/10

Day 6:
Today brought the most intense pain yet with this morning being the toughest start so far. The pain is sharp but still manageable with medication, though I‚Äôm not following a strict painkiller schedule since I have a decent pain tolerance and I don‚Äôt want to overload my stomach. I managed to eat soft foods like angel hair pasta in beef broth, kids‚Äô yogurt, and some watermelon. I had some new zapping pains, occasional pinkish saliva when spitting, and a mild temperature increase that peaked around 37¬∞C. Despite everything, I‚Äôm still taking in ~1000 calories daily. Since Day 1, I‚Äôve lost about 4 kg. Pain level: ~8/10.

Day 7: 
Despite switching into an every-4hrs-painkillers schedule paracetamol last night wore off in 1 hour so I had to wake up, manage to swallow some mouthfuls of vanilla pudding in order to get my ibuprofen. I didn‚Äôt enjoy my sleep and the morning was even tougher than yesterday, but I bounced back in 1-2 hrs after taking all my prescribed medication and having some vitamin and electrolytes fuelled water. I feel the scubs going down and my throat mucus as dense as ever despite my ultra hydrated body. Tomorrow I‚Äôm going back to my freelance wfh job! I hope that there will be the pain turning point! I miss coffee so fucking much üò≠


My Top Tips So Far:

üëâHydrate heavily BEFORE surgery. I think it‚Äôs an overlooked tip and I think it helps managing hydration afterwards

üëâUse a humidifier and air conditioning nonstop to create the perfect environment, especially during sleep (so you can enjoy sleeping)

üëâSleep a little bit elevated: reduces gag early on, throat pressure, and swelling

üëâPush food even if it‚Äôs difficult. Find something you can manage eating and stick by it. Chicken or beef broth is the best thing out there. 

üëâ Constant water sipping + sleep >>> anything else

üëâ Cold chamomile tea did better job than any painkiller to my throat.

üëâ Kids‚Äô yogurts are way more gentle to the throat than greek yogurt (I‚Äôm from Greece and this one was quite shocking fact)

üëâ Anxiety makes everything worse. I think it‚Äôs fine to take a sedative (checking with your doctor) to help things at night. It was the first time of my life taking one and helped a ton the first 2 days. 

üëâ Idk why people experience bad breath, I‚Äôve been brushing my teeth and had baking soda and salt water rinses since day 2 and I‚Äôve been fine!

Context: My boyfriend and I have been dating since 2015 but we have been away most of our relationship because of our set-up. Total of 3 years lang kami nagkasama in Metro Manila for work and before the pandemic hits he was petitioned by his Kuya in US and currently living there, 2022 noong nagka chance sya umuwi to see me and every year na syang umuuwi once para makasama ako, papers has been set and waiting nalang for approval pero one day parang nagising ako feeling lost and nawawala na feelings ko. Napagod ata ako kakaintay and nasanay mag-isang mag coffee, grocery and mamuhay. We do facetime everyday pero it‚Äôs been 3 months I have been feeling this. Sobrang guilty ko sa sarili that I should not be feeling this, pumunta pa ako sa Manaog kasi I prayed to her please guide me and itama ang nararamdaman ko.

We made plans for our lives, I know he loves me very much and I did too. 5 years did took it‚Äôs toll na magkahiwalay kami. Nasanay akong mag isa na mamuhay. He will be coming home this October and mukhang my plans na sya to propose dahil he plans to go to Bali.

I want to still try pero what if hindi na talaga kaya? That is what I am afraid of.

Hindi ko alam pano ko sasabihin sakanya na may nararamdaman na akong ganito.

Prologue

A royal guard kneeled in front of the king‚Äôs throne. He was breathing hard and panicking.

""Pardon me for disturbing you, Your Majesty, but I have something very important to tell you.""

The king looked at him while still kissing the neck of the woman who was sitting in his lap. His expression was showing boredom and disinterest. But he still signed him to stand up and talk.

""We found her.‚Äù He stopped what he was doing and looked at the man with a hint of interest in his face. They found her‚Ä¶ After five long years, they finally found her.

""Continue,"" He ordered. The royal guard bowed his head before starting to talk.

""We found her in the middle of the forest inside the territory, roaming around. It looks like she's picking some herbal medicines."" He answered.

""How come I didn't feel her?"" He asked himself.

""Fool. You rejected her remember?"" His wolf replied angrily. His face darkened. It has been very difficult to tame his wolf since that night. The night when he rejected his human mate.

""Shut up!"" He hissed.

""Yeah, whatever."" His wolf lifelessly replied.

""We decided to approach her, but before we could reach her destination, she looked at us and began running away. We chase her, but she's too fast for a human, and then we lose sight of her."" The royal guard continued.

His fist turned into a ball. He couldn‚Äôt believe that he didn't even feel her presence within his territory. His warriors found her, but she escaped? Careless idiots.

""When did this happen?!"" He angrily asked him. He couldn‚Äôt help but get frustrated with what‚Äôs going on. He had been searching for her for long time and now they found her, she managed to escape? A mere human they can‚Äôt even locate? Damn it.

""Just a few minutes ago, Your Majesty."" His jaw clenched as his grip tightened onto the woman in his arm.

""Find her now and bring her to me!"" He ordered. They quickly nodded their heads.

""Yes, your highness."" They bowed their head before leaving the throne room.

He let go of the woman in his arms.

""Leave now, and don't come back."" The lady quickly left in fear.

An enraged alpha is frightening enough, but imagine the terror when it is the Alpha king himself. That would be truly terrifying.

Chapter 01: The Rejection

Her Point of View

Five years ago

I was lying down on my bed while reading my favorite book, Pride and Prejudice, when Amanda, my best friend, interrupted me from reading.

""Come on, Harper, get your ass off to your bed and prepare!"" She energetically exclaimed to me.

Geez, she's too loud and alive.

""I'm not coming, Amanda,"" I replied without even looking at her.

""Argh, seriously, Harp? You've got to be kidding me, and tonight will be a remarkable day because it is the ceremony of the next king! Did you hear me? The coronation of the new werewolf king!"" She literally yelled at my face.

I stop reading my book and look at her carefully.

""Stop yelling, Amanda. Look, I don't need to attend that ceremony, and you know the reasons why, Am,"" I calmly said to her.

""Look also, Harper Alizah Grace Larkspur, get your lazy ass out the bed now because you're coming with me to that ball tonight, and it will exactly start 3 hours from now."" She seriously commanded me

I can't help but smile. I found it so funny when I saw her so serious like this.

""Okay, fine,"" I answered while closing my book and carefully putting it back on my bookshelf.

She clapped her hand twice and smiled so widely. I know I can‚Äôt win any argument with her. Still the same Amanda I know. Manipulating freak. But a good one.

""Alright then, come on."" She happily said and winked at me. Here we go again; I groaned silently and glared at her.

This would be tiring. I walked outside my room and followed her. When we arrived there, I saw a blue backless gown. I immediately look at her. She's grinning from ear to ear, flashing her mischievous smile. It looks like she's planning something not-so-good.

What a cunning girl. I pouted mentally.

""I will not definitely wear that shit.""

""Well, watch me."" she grinned even more.

We argued for a few minutes, but later on, she made me wear that damn gown.

""Argh, I hate you now, Amanda!"" I complained and gave her a death glare. But she just smirked at me.

""Oh please, don't hate me. You look smoking ‚Äòhot babe,""

I frowned but still glared at her.

""Hurry up, you're not done yet. Do your make-up. I'll be back later."" She hurriedly said and went to the bathroom. But before she completely got in, she winked at me again, which I just cringed.

What's wrong with her?

I just did my make-up while waiting for her. After a few minutes, she walked out, wearing a strapless green high-cut slit gown.

I raised one eyebrow at her.

"" What do you think, Harp? Do I look smokin' ‚Äòhot like you?"" She playfully asked me.

This time, I smirked at her, time for her to pay back.

""Not even a bit."" I teased her.

""You're so mean,"" she said dramatically and frowned. I chuckled softly.

""Nah, I'm just kidding. You look great.""

""Just great?""

""Yeah, what else?‚Äù It‚Äôs not only her who know to tease, I can do better.

Amanda is an incredibly beautiful young woman with ginger hair, dark green eyes. She could pass as a supermodel.

""No smoking hot?‚Äù I chuckled again.

‚ÄúYes, you look smoking hot, and I know that you know that, so‚Ä¶ no need for me to tell.""

""I thought so; you won't let me down. That's why we're friends."" She sat on the chair beside me, and we looked at ourselves in the mirror.

""Do you think I‚Äôll find my mate tonight?"" She asked me suddenly so I looked at her.

""You know, I'm dying to meet him. It's been two years already since I turned 18, but until now..."" She stops and sighs.

""Until now, I can't still find him,"" she paused again and faced me.

""I'm starting to think now that I don't have a mate."" She continued.

I held her hand and gave her a reassuring smile.

""Stop thinking about it, drama queen, you have your mate. Maybe you need to wait for the right time. I know you'll find him soon, so don't lose hope."" She smiled at what I said and loosened up a bit.

""Do you really think I'll find him?"" I nodded my head. ‚ÄúOf course, you will.‚Äù

""Alright, you're right. I shouldn't lose hope and be optimistic. And speaking of mate... Maybe you'll find yours tonight!"" I immediately shook my head.

""We both know that I don't have a mate. I'm a human Am, and that's also one of the reasons why I don't want to go to the ball. I do not belong there."" This time, she's the one who held my hand.

""Who said you don't belong there? You're one of the few people who know our existence, and that makes you rare, Harper. You don't know how fate works. We don't know, maybe you had a mate. I think there are some cases in which a human can have a werewolf mate, vampire mate or any creature."" She said to me.

I just smiled at what she said. Possible but impossible in my case. It‚Äôs very rare for a human to have a mate.

""We should stop this drama now, Am; it was giving me goosebumps.""

She playfully punched my shoulder and laughed with me. We make ourselves pretty for the ball party.

Me and Amanda live near the palace where the royal family is living. I met her a year ago at the Blue Moon Festival. We talk until the moon is replaced by the sun. So much talk, right?

From that moment, we became friends.

""Are you ready, Harper?"" She asked me. I nodded.

We left her house and went to the grand entrance of the palace. Everyone is invited to come, but I don't think I'm also allowed.

I heard that the new king has a thing against humans. He hates humans, and I don't know why. I glance at her; she's so happy right now. Maybe hoping that she'll find her mate tonight. I wish her luck.

""Miss Amanda,"" the guards at the gate greeted her and bowed their heads.

Amanda was the daughter of the Royal Chief Warriors; she had two younger siblings and an older brother.

She nodded at them and smiled.

""Is the ball already started?""

""Yes, Miss Amanda,"" one of them answered emotionlessly. Sometimes, I‚Äôm thinking if the royal guards were robots. They seldom show emotions.

""Oh, okay, well, we'll go ahead now."" She said and held my hand. Before we passed by, I saw them murmuring the word ‚Äúhuman‚Äù.

They are also aware that the new king hates humans. I wish that the king won‚Äôt see or pay attention to me tonight.

""Look, Harper! My father was there!"" I look from where she pointed. I saw a man in his late fifties. He's standing straight while having a serious expression on his face.

He had an intimidating aura.

""The person behind him was my brother."" She continued.

And then my glance travels to the person behind her father. I saw a young man in his mid-twenties. He looks great, and I think it runs in their blood.

I was busy observing the surroundings when I felt Amanda's grip tighten.

""What's wrong?"" I asked her.

She looks scared, stunned, and so lost. She's bothered.

""The king‚Äôs watching us,"" She whispered.

""Oh? Maybe he's not. Where is he?"" I asked.

""Above, don't look. Please don't talk to him. Stay away from him, just tonight.‚Äù I nodded my head and held her hand on my arm.

""Yes, I will, don't worry.""

""Alright then, let's go there."" We were about to walk when she stopped again. What happened this time? Don‚Äôt tell me the king came down to drag me out?

""Did you smell that scent?"" She asked me.

I confusedly stared at her.

""Smell what? Aside from food and different perfumes, I smell nothing.""

""Oh my... This smell..."" Her eyes widened.

""Smell of my mate."" She said to me. I blinked once. Did she find her mate now?

""I'm so sorry to leave you here now. I'll go and find him now. I don't want to waste this opportunity. But I promise I'll be back soon."" She said hurriedly. I nodded my head.

""No worries, but promise me, you will find him. If not, I'll smack you. I'm just kidding. Go ahead now, and good luck.""

She laughed softly and tapped my shoulder.

""Alright, see you later!"" She said and then left.

I looked around again, but then suddenly, I saw something. I was so stunned when I met a captivating pair of grey eyes.

""Mate."" My wolf, Reenah, yelled in joy.

Yeah, I know that I'm lying to Amanda, but don't blame me. It was for her safety and mine. No one should know about my true identity.

""Don't be a pussy, Reenah, obviously, he doesn't even want us."" My demon, Venice sassily replied.

""Will the both of you stop arguing?!"" My witch, Wendy, tried to stop them.

Here we go again; they will argue nonstop. Before they can start shouting, which will definitely be annoying. I blocked them.

I looked in his direction again; he was still staring at me. He‚Äôs aware that I was his mate, but he's not making any move to claim me.

Whatever.

I just shrugged and went towards the buffet table.

""Go to him, please, Alizah."" My wolf begs me. I shook my head.

""No, Reenah, we both know that we can't have a mate,"" I said to her.

""We can. Please, I need him; we need him."" She pleaded. I let out a sigh silently.

""Miss?"" I heard someone call me from behind. I looked at him and gave him a questioning look.

""The king wanted to see you,"" he replied.

Oh really?

""Go to him now! I knew it; he wanted us also!"" My wolf happily said.

I doubt that, but okay, fine. I'll face him. I nodded to the man and followed him.

We went to a huge and beautiful room. It's screaming wealth and power. The man who brought me here immediately leaved.

""So, you're my mate."" I stiffened and searched where the voice came from. I found him near the window, and his back was facing me.

He slowly turned around to face me, and the first thing I saw was his greyish eyes. I can clearly see anger and disgust on his face.

""What's your name?"" He asked me seriously; coldness was also evident in his voice. As what I expected from him. Be cold and distant to me.

""Tell him now, Alizah!"" My voice shouted. She's too happy; I'm afraid there will be a high possibility that her heart will break into a million pieces later.

""I'm Harper Alizah Grace Larkspur,"" I answered. He devilishly smirk and approach me slowly.

""I, King Zachary Vance Spencer Montegromery, Reject you, Harper Alizah Grace Larkspur as my mate and the future queen of werewolves.""

My wolf whimpered from what she heard while me? I'm still processing in my mind what the heck he just said.

The way he told me that he was rejecting me was as if it was just nothing to him.

""Bastard!"" My demon cussed him.

""He's not a bastard Ven!"" Reenah yelled back.

My mind was chaotic now. I calmed myself and blocked them again. I step once and smirk at him.

""May I know why you're rejecting me?"" I asked him calmly. His jaw clenched, and he glared at me.

""Isn't it obvious? You're just a pathetic, weak and useless human. And clearly, a human can't be my mate!"" Why he's so angry? I didn't even do something terrible to him.

""Tell him, Alizah? Tell him you're not human!"" My wolf begs me. I don't know what I will do now. I closed my eyes and tried to block them, but it seemed like I couldn't control them now because of this situation.

""Don't beg him to accept us; it's not our loss, it's him,"" Wendy said to me. Venice agreed too, but my wolf was saying differently. She was telling me that I should tell him who, really, I am.

""I'm sorry, Reenah, but I'm choosing us over him.""

I looked at him and smiled. He called me pathetic, weak and useless human. I'm wondering what makes him hate humans so bad.

""Okay, fine, yes, I'm just a human, and do you know what that does mean? Rejection can't hurt me."" I confidently said and looked directly into his eyes.

""I, Harper Alizah Grace Larkspur, accept your rejection, King Zachary Vance Spencer Montegromery as your mate and the future queen of werewolves."" After I said that, I smirked at him, which made him mad and confused.

I could feel that he was in pain like I felt right now, but of course, I didn't show him that I was hurting.

Reenah was begging me to take back what I've said, but what I've done is done; I can't undo something that already happened.

Our bond was slowly fading as I could feel the strong pain in my heart. It feels like it's ripping me apart.

""Leave now, Alizah,"" Wendy said to me. Before I can turn my back on him, he grabs my arm so firmly in the way I can feel so much pain.

""Listen carefully, human; I know that you can't feel the pain I felt right now, so get out of my fucking territory and don't come back!"" He angrily yelled in my face.

I gave him a death glare. If he's thinking that I'll be scared of him, well, he's wrong. I jerk away so his grip loosens. A loud and hard slap touches his cheeks.

""That's what I'm going to do, dumbass! Do you think I would like to stay in this fucking place with you? Don't be dumb! I don't need someone like you, and I don't fucking care if you're the werewolf king! "" I yelled back angrily.

I'm starting to lose my shit too. His face darkened, and in just a matter of seconds, he slapped me so hard that it made me fall to the ground.

Before I could stand up, a bunch of warriors came and literally dragged me up.

""Take her away from my territory, and don't let her come back. That was an order!"" He yelled.

""Yes, Your Majesty!""

Before they could drag me out, I gave him a death glare. Don't let our paths cross again, King. I won't forgive you easily. Not until I find a good and valid reason for me to forgive you.

As we reach the ball hall, they all stop dancing and look at me with confusion. All of them don't have any idea what's going on.

""Harper!"" I heard someone yell from the crowd.

I searched where she was, and I saw her running towards my direction.

""What are you doing to her?! Let her go! She did nothing wrong!"" She shouted, trying to defend me.

The warriors were still dragging me out while Amanda is still following us.

Outside the palace, I saw a sleek black car parked at the end of the red carpet.

""Stop! Stop now! "" She ordered, but they didn't obey or even listening to her.

""No! Don't take her away, she's innocent!"" She begged when she saw me getting into the car.

The car started to move; I saw in the side mirror she was still looking at the car where I am right now.

""I'm sorry, Amanda for leaving; I'm so sorry also for lying to you. I'll promise when our paths will cross again; I'll make it up to you. Take care, Amanda Carnelian."" I mind-linked to her

After that, I was exiled to the place where my mate, my ex-mate precisely, ruled.

# Chapter 02: Peaceful Life

Chapter 02: Peaceful Life

Her Point of View

Present Time

Time passed by quickly. It‚Äôs been five years since the day he rejected me. What could be more exciting? He banned me from entering his territory! Isn't he an asshole? My wolf cried nonstop for the first year after he rejected me. She was in pain, unable to talk for a long time.

Blame that stupid king. When Reenah started crying, my vampire, Venice, ranted and raved at her, which is fucking annoying.

Their argument makes me feel sick, completely making me lose my sh\*t.

I admit that handling the three of them is a nightmare, but it is also fun. Having wolf, vampire, and witch blood may be both a blessing and a curse.

My father was an alpha but he died with the pack because they protected me. And what about my mother? I am still wondering where she is right now. I have not seen her since I was born.

The only thing I am sure of is that she is a half-witch and a vampire, which makes me even rarer.

I have lived in the human world since he threw me out of his kingdom. Life annoys me in my first week in the human world.

Having a wolf, whimpering in agony and a vampire thirsty for human blood. Thanks to Wendy, she is not causing me too much discomfort. Except for her strange stuff like making potions, medications, etc.

""Alizah! Are you okay?"" I jolted back to reality when I heard someone called my name.

""Yes?"" I muttered, glancing at her, puzzled.

It is Mindy, one of my coworkers at the coffee shop where I work.

""I'm wondering if you're okay. It looks like you're spacing out again,"" she worriedly asked. I shook my head and gave her a reassuring smile.

""Nah, I'm all right. Umm, maybe I'm just tired,"" I replied and continued wiping the table.

""Are you sure? You looked bothered?""

""Yeah, I'm fine. I'll wait until my shift ends, and then, I'll head home."" She let out a sigh and nodded.

I waited for two more hours before my work hours finally ended.

""See you soon, Mindy, bye!"" I said before I left. She smiles and waves her hand.

""Bye, Alizah! Rest well, okay?"" I nodded again and left.

I was heading back home when I felt that someone was following me. I look back to see who it could be, but all I see is darkness.

When I arrived at my house, I quickly open the door and locked it. I lay on my bed and dropped my sling bag on the table. Life is exhausting. I close my eyes to relax and calm down.

Three years ago, I became aware that someone, or rather, a group of warriors, was following me. And I was not born yesterday not to know who‚Äôs the mastermind behind it.

I can see them thanks to my unique abilities, but they cannot see me.

I am still wondering, what does he want? He rejected me already. Does he want me dead? Oh, that dumb king who only values himself. He is so selfish.

What do I expect? A man like him is cruel and does not know how to love. He is a filthy bad boy, a heartbreaker, manipulative, and an impulsive decision-maker.

He said that he did not want me to be his mate. So, I don't need him in my life either.

I opened my eyes. I dragged myself out of bed and went into the bathroom to bathe.

After bathing, I changed into my nightgown and applied cosmetics to my face. I didn't know such things at first, but thanks to Mindy, I now do. She claims that such products will whiten and moisturize my skin.

I nearly laughed that time. You see, having werewolf, vampire, and witch blood got some perks too. I don't need beauty products to be beautiful because it's already inborn.

But I eventually got used to it and used it every day. When my phone rang, I stopped applying lotion to my body. When I realised it was Mindy, I instantly answered.

""Yes?""

A couple of silences later, she still didn't talk. I blinked once and waited for her words.

""Mindy?""

""Umm..."" Huh? Is there something she needs to say to me? I think something is bothering her.

""Yes? Are you all right?"" She didn't answer my question. Probably she's deciding if she'll going to tell or not.

""We... We ...""

""We what?""

""We?...""

""We?...""

""We lost our job."" She finally said.

What?

""What do you mean?"" I ask her.

""When you left earlier, our big boss came over and told us bad news. He said he would sell this coffee shop because his income is low, and he said a condominium will be established later."" She explained.

Oh? I see.

""He said he's so sorry, and your last salary has already been transferred to your bank account,"" she continued.

That's a big deal‚Äîthree years of working at that cafe, and now it's over. Nothing in this world lasts forever.

""Okay, Mindy, thank you for informing me,"" I calmly told her.

""You're welcome, Alizah. Anyway, what will you do now?"" She asked me.

""Honestly, I don't know. Maybe, I'll relax. Thanks for the concern, though.""

""Hmm, okay, if you need help, I just want you to know I'm here for you."" Oh, that's so kind of her.

""Thanks again, Mindy.""

""All right, I'll hang up now.""

""Okay, bye.""

""Bye.""

And the call ended.

All right, I'm a jobless person now. What a nice day.

""I want a peaceful life,"" Wendy mumbled.

What? A peaceful life? Aren‚Äôt we having a peaceful life already?

""You mean we'll leave this city?"" Reenah asked.

""Uh-huh."" She replied. That was an excellent idea.

""What? Wait! I don't want to leave this place!"" Venice exclaimed.

""If we're going to leave, where should we go?"" I asked.

""Let's return to where we came from,"" Wendy suggested.

""To our mate?"" Reenah asked, holding out hope.

""Come on, Reenah. It‚Äôs our ex-mate."" Oh no, not again. I spoke up before they could start debating.

""All right, we'll go back there without causing any trouble, and besides, if I go inside his territory one more time, they won't notice me,"" I remarked. They agreed with everything I said.

""I'll go back tomorrow, but for now, I just want to rest,"" I sighed, I feel sleepy suddenly.

""Me too. I'm so tired,"" Wendy yawned.

I went straight to my bed and lie down there. I wake up early in the morning to perform my morning routines, and prepared some items for travelling.

I used to live in a cabin in the middle of the forest before meeting Amanda. The cabin is small, but it is not cramped. It is hidden yet a perfect place to stay at.

Furthermore, the entire area was shielded by a barrier that I made.

Speaking about Amanda, I miss her terribly. I'm curious how she's doing right now. She must upset because I lied to her?

Is she already married with children? I wonder if she and her mate end up after what happened five years ago.

We'll see each other soon, Amanda.

I withdraw money from my account and bought several good stocks before leaving the city. I'm ready to go after that. If a warrior finds and sees me, I'll either flee or show them what I'm capable of.

I took a cab and went to the edge of his territory. After I paid and got out, clutching my belongings in both hands. Before I faced the border of his land, I watched the cab leave.

I felt good; it's great to be back. I'm sure he'll be furious and irritated when he realizes that I will live on his land without him knowing anything about it.

As an alpha or the Alpha King, he will be the first to notice that an outsider has entered his territory. With a mischievous smirk on my lips, I carefully moved my feet and entered the woods.

""Take over now, Reenah. Wendy will cover your scent while you, Venice, help Reenah boost her strength and speed,"" I ordered.

""Copy,"" I placed my belongings on the ground and began shifting into my werewolf form, allowing Reenah to take control of my body.

I'm a pure white werewolf, not as big as a male werewolf but far bigger than an average werewolf. That's hardly surprising, given my Alpha blood.

Reenah run fast, thanks to Venice. We arrived at the cabin without being seen by anyone. The house was quite old, and certain parts had been devastated by various natural disasters.

When I entered, I was greeted by dust and spiderwebs. Why am I anticipating a long day? I returned to my human shape and put on my clothing. I looked around the room and then took a deep breath.

This cabin needs a makeover, and I need to repair the damaged parts of the house. Okay, I sighed deeply and smiled. I'm sure I can do it. Let this old house be clean and comfortable once more.

I began cleaning, sorting, repairing, and discarding useless items outside while producing new items to place inside. I altered the design of the house to make it more welcoming and comfortable.

I reorganized my bedroom and washed the bedsheets and curtains. I fixed the door and windows, and the floor was as gleaming as the furniture.

My door and windows are solid and long-lasting. My room resembles a five-star hotel suite. I'm fantastic. But the truth is that I'm exhausted. It's already past 8 p.m. I didn't eat my lunch, so I'm starving now.

I went to my spotless and gleaming kitchen. I cooked my dinner and ate it at precisely 9 p.m. I scrubbed the dishes after eating and then caved in on my bed since I was skeptical.

The darkness whisked me away into a deep slumber in minutes. When I get up in the morning, it's already past ten. Oh, I did sleep over, but it's relaxing. I stretch my arm while yawning.

""I hope for a good day,"" I mumbled, knowing no one could hear me.

I get out of bed and go to the bathroom. I need to go shopping for cooking utensils and equipment.

I also need some technological devices because it's boring here. I have a hydroelectric transplant here, which allows electronic equipment to function.

I examined it recently and was relieved to find that it was still operational. I was dressed in black leggings and a white hoodie. I wore my black mask and knotted my silver-like hair.

Before I left, I locked the door to my cabin and went to the nearest market, which was also close to my old apartment. Amanda's house and I wonder whether she still comes to our flat.

I found out a year ago that her mate was the Royal Beta. I'm delighted for her because her mate welcomed her entirely without any concerns or confusion.

While mine, he rejected me without even knowing who I was. He's an asshole.

""The king is so hot! Oh gosh, I hope he'll pick me. I'm willing to be his bed warmer. Yum,"" the girl giggled.

Yum? That's disgusting. Anyway, no one is stopping her from being his ""bed warmer"".

I calm down myself. I bought everything I needed and returned to my cabin with everything I had purchased.

# Chapter 03: Meet Again

Chapter 03: Meet Again

Two weeks Later

Her point of view

I was actively collecting herbs when I heard voices nearby. I stopped and took a look around. Holly shit! I noticed some royal guards wandering around, and one of them noticed me.

Have I gone too far? The man who is staring at me... He appears to be quite familiar to me. Staring at him, I came to a realization. My eyes widened. He‚Äôs Amanda's brother.

When I saw them approaching, I took a step back.

""Do you want me to kill them all?"" Venice sassily asked. Damn, how I would love to, but I can't.

""No. Wendy, let Venice take over. We need to get out of here now,"" I replied.

""What? Why do you need to run away? We can kill them all in one shot!"" Venice scoffed. My brow furrowed, nope.

""We don't kill for no reason, Ven, so just do what I've said!"" I insisted. If I could see her right now, she probably roll her eyes at me. They switch quickly, and I flee as fast as possible before the Royal Guards can approach me.

I was aware that they were chasing after me. They transform quickly into their werewolf form while I use my vampire speed.

They were now chasing me and yelling at me to stop. Some were cursing me in their heads, which I could read.

I was eventually able to lose them after an hour of chasing. I'd gotten away. When I got to my house, I reinforced the barrier around it. I lay down on my couch and sighed.

""That was so close,"" I mumble.

""Yeah, right,"" Wendy agreed.

""And hella exhausting,"" Reenah added.

""It's better if we just kill them, "" Venice still insisted. Sometimes, I'm thinking if I'm the one who owns my body or not.

""We never kill for no reason, Ven. How many times do I have to tell you that?"" I chastised her.

""No reason? They were chasing you and possibly wanted to murder you. Is that still no reason? We have reason to kill them,"" she reasons out. I facepalm mentally. She‚Äôs right but I can‚Äôt hurt Amanda‚Äôs brother.

I lied to her five years ago and I can‚Äôt add salt to her wounds.

""That's not enough, Ven. I don't want to argue with you anymore. Let's¬†take some rest,""

""Yeah, whatever,""

Even though she‚Äôs hard to please and tame, she's still part of me.

I headed to the kitchen to get some water to drink. I sighed again, wondering what to do if that stupid king could find me. Should I tell him who I am and what I am capable of? No. In his eyes, I will always be a weak creature.

But... I'm going to make him regret not knowing who I am. If he comes back later, I will not let him kill me. Instead, I will kill him.

I don't care if he's the fucking King of the werewolves or my ex-mate. I stopped thinking when I felt someone touch my barrier. No, someone is destroying the barrier.

He arrived earlier than I expected, huh? I went outside and saw him. He was the only one who arrived here.

I cross my arms and watch him destroy my defense. He's not in his wolf form, but he's causing havoc on the barrier I've built.

How powerful is this man? I almost forgot he's a king. The werewolf King. The Alpha of all Alphas.

When I noticed a crack, I stepped back to prevent him from destroying the barrier. He was caught by surprise by what had happened.

""Hot, he's so handsome."" I overheard Reenah say. That‚Äôs gross, Reenah.

""He's not handsome, Reenah, "" Venice disagreed. Here we go again.

""Stop arguing, Reenah and Venice. You both aren't helping. "" I warned them. Thankfully, they stopped.

I looked at him and noticed him staring at me with longing eyes. What? Longing? That's complete nonsense! Maybe it was rage and hatred.

We exchanged a few more glances before he began walking in my direction. He just stopped walking when he was in front of me.

""What are you doing here?"" He demanded angrily. I wanted to laugh and curse him right now.

""I know I'm exiled and unable to stay in this place, but I'm not making any scene or troubling you. "" I answered emotionlessly.

Oh, wait, why am I explaining to him anyway? He remained silent and just stared at me.

""I want to live in peace. You rejected me already. What else do you want from me?"" I seriously added. He silently came closer and grabbed my waist.

""How come I didn't feel your presence?"" He whispered in my ear. I wanted to smirk but didn't; I tried to push him away.

‚ÄúDoes it bother you?‚Äù I mocked.

""Answer my question, woman!"" He warned me and tightened his grip on my waist.

What the hell is going on? I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs my fault if he doesn't notice me. He wouldn't, of course. Wendy cast a powerful spell, disguising my scent and presence.

""I don't know,"" I simply answered. His grip loosens up, and he raises an eyebrow.

""What are you?""

A powerful creature that you just rejected, asshole. I wanted to answer, but I stopped myself. He doesn‚Äôt deserve to know.

""Isn't it obvious that I'm a human?"" I sassed out. He abruptly let go of my hand, and I stared at him.

What the heck?

""I want you to come with me,"" He coldly asked--- no he demanded. What? Is he fucking kidding me?

""Go with him, Alizah. I can still feel the bond. The bond was still there,"" Reenah remarked optimistically.

My brow furrowed. How might the connection still exist? I accepted his rejection five years ago. I feel the bond breaking, and we lose the connection. And now, how?

""Go with him, and let's figure it out,"" Wendy suggested.

""Why will you go with him? He's a worthless son of bitch!"" Venice angrily cursed.

""Ven, watch your words!"" Wendy warned her

""Yeah, whatever. I‚Äôm just stating the truth here."" I let out a sigh. This situation is killing me, damn it.

""Why would I go with you?"" I questioned him. He looks at me with his dark and intense eyes

""Because you're mine."" Because of what he said, I laughed hard. Damn, I'm his? Haha, are you kidding me?

""It seems like you forgot, Your Majesty. You rejected me five years ago. So you don't have the right to put a claim on me anymore."" That was hilarious. I'm his, my ass.

""Rejected or not, you're still mine, mine alone and forever,"" he replied firmly. Damn, is he serious?

This time, instead of laughing. I only smirked.

""Your claim on me is long gone and late, your Majesty. You had the chance and right five years ago, but you ruined it,"" I said seriously, and every word I uttered was true and firm.

Pain shot across his eyes, but it went as quickly as it never happened. He's skilled at concealing his true emotions and feelings, right? His expression turned chilly and stern.

""I'm not asking your permission to go with me. My words are clear, and it's an order,"" he continued, his tone threatening.

Is he trying to use his alpha voice on me? Did he also forget that I am not a member of his pack? What a jackass. But whatever.

""Okay, I'll come with you."" He immediately looks at me, slightly surprised by my response. I'll go with him and make sure he suffers. Later, he will regret what he did.

""Alizah? You'll go with him, right?"" Reenah asked me with hope in her voice.

""Yes,"" I could see Reenah was happy.

""All right then, let's go,"" he said coldly, turning around. He's something.

""Hold on,"" I stopped him. He looked at me.

""I have something to get first before I go with you,"" I said solemnly. He only nodded and turned his back on me without saying anything. He's a scumbag. I just rolled my eyes.

I start heading to my cabin to get my belongings. I noticed him standing beside his expensive grey sports car when I went outside. So, he drove himself here.

""What are you waiting for? Come on, let's go now!"" He ordered.

Jerk! Venice angrily murmured. Wendy and I agreed with her, but Reenah did not. She‚Äôs jumping with joy right now.

I let out a sigh. If I'm not curious why we still had the bond, I won't go with him into his fucking Mansion, castle, whatever they called it.

I got into the backseat of his car. ""What are you doing?"" He asked me. I confusedly look at him. Isn‚Äôt it obvious?

""Sit here in front,"" huh? Do I need to do that? What's the difference? I'm still coming with him, sitting in the backseat or the passenger seat.

I sigh and go out peacefully. I sat beside him and completely ignored his presence. I found him annoying as hell.

I started panicking when I felt him coming near to me. I can even smell his strong scent, the smell of Cinnamon and Vanilla.

He smells so good; Reenah was right. The bond still exists, but how? I was taken back into reality when I saw him smirk and set up my seatbelt.

""Safety first,"" Oh right, he's still thinking that I'm just a human who is weak and worthless.

That's so cool of him; note the sarcasm. Well, I'll play cool and be weak in his eyes. He started the engine of his car and drove away from my cabin. I just looked outside the window of his car for the whole duration.

‚ÄúHow are you?"" He suddenly asked me. He is asking me as if we're friends; I ignore him and his question. He deserves to be ignored; silent treatment is a bitch.

""I'm asking you,"" he repeated, but again, I just ignored him. I heard him sigh in defeat, which made me proud of myself.

""Talk to him, Alizah,"" Reenah begged me.

""Not now, Reenah; I don't have the mood and reason to talk to him."" She didn't reply; she understood and respected my decision.

After a few minutes, we reached the outskirts of the city. His castle was located at the top of a hill. I really miss this place; I touch the window of his car and smile a bit. It's really good to be back here; I think if I weren't his mate, I'd still be living in this place so peacefully and happily.

I stopped thinking about the past when I heard his voice; he was saying something.

""Welcome to my kingdom."" Welcome to my kingdom, my ass. He can easily say that as if he hadn't exiled me and nearly killed me because of his anger issues. I just ignored him even if I wanted to curse him. Suddenly, the car stopped, which made me stumble a little. I immediately glared at him.

""What the heck?"" He's also looking at me right now as if he wanted to murder me.

""Quit that bitchy attitude of yours or else...‚Äù his voice was hateful and full of anger. Yeah, madman. I met his eyes and gave him a challenging look.

""Or else what? "" I challenged.

In just a matter of seconds, he was holding my arm so tight, and I was sitting in his lap. The heck? I'd be lying if I said I'm not hurt because his grip made me feel sick.

""I won't tolerate this attitude of yours; I will fucking punish you if you disrespect me again, you stupid, weak human. I don't care if you're my mate; if you don't fucking behave and obey me, I will make you pay."" He warned me while looking directly into my eyes.

Yeah, I fucking admit, he's damn look scary right now. If looks can kill, I'm a cold and lifeless corps now.

""Understood? "" I slowly nodded my head.

# Chapter 04: Palace

Chapter 04: Palace

Harper Alizah Grace's POV

After I nodded, he released my hand. ""Good,"" he coldly uttered. I solemnly glared at him, but he stared back. After a few seconds, I realised I was still sitting on his lap. My cheeks grew a little rosy. I quickly averted my gaze.

Don't get me wrong. I'm still a woman, and he was my mate. Intimacy makes me feel appreciated and special, especially with my wolf, Reenah.

I tried to pull away, but he wrapped his arm around my waist and tightened his grip even more. What is he thinking?

""Let me go,"" I warned. But instead of letting me go, he smirked and whispered something in my ear.

""I like our current position,"" he said seductively. After that, he moved his head slowly toward the crook of my neck. As his warm breath touched my neck, my fist turned white. This is dangerous; I'm not sure why it feels superb.

When his lips travelled down my collarbone and teased it, I couldn't help but arch my back and close my eyes tightly.

""Really, Alizah? You let yourself be seduced by him?"" Venice said in my head, jolting me back into reality. I quickly pushed him away and jumped off his lap.

""Don't ever do that again!"" I said bitterly. He just shrugged his shoulders and smirked. He's got some attitude, doesn't he?

I'm rather certain that we will not get along. We had different life perspectives; he's also too much for me to manage. Just seeing him irritates me. Geez. Why did he become my mate? Is the Moon Goddess making fun of me?

Climate Change & Global Hunger: Unpacking the Crisis, Finding Solutions  
  
Explore the urgent crisis where climate change fuels global hunger, impacting food security for millions worldwide. This video explores the intricate relationship between rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and our food systems, providing valuable insights from the latest research.  
  
Discover how climate change impacts food availability, access, utilization, and stability. Learn about the varied effects on agricultural productivity, including changes in crop yields (maize, wheat, rice, coffee), the spread of pests and diseases, and threats to livestock health due to increased heat and drought. Elevated CO2 concentrations, while sometimes beneficial for crop productivity, are projected to lower the nutritional quality of staple crops like wheat and rice, reducing protein, zinc, and iron content, affecting the health of hundreds of millions. We also examine the alarming rise in food prices and the devastating impact of water scarcity on global agriculture and food production.  
  
The global food system itself is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, from agricultural activities like enteric fermentation, manure management, and synthetic fertilizer use, to land use change such as deforestation, and ""beyond farm gate"" activities like processing, transport, and waste.  
  
However, the sources highlight various solutions. On the supply side, strategies include improved soil management (soil organic matter, erosion control), advanced livestock and grazing land management, genetic improvements for heat and drought tolerance in crops, and diversification through integrated production systems and agroforestry. Demand-side adaptations, such as adopting healthy and sustainable diets that are higher in plant-based foods and lower in energy-intensive animal products, along with reducing food loss and waste throughout the supply chain, offer major opportunities for both climate mitigation and improved health outcomes.  
  
The video addresses the importance of transforming food systems through multifaceted and integrated approaches, emphasizing climate-smart agriculture and promoting resilience in vulnerable communities, particularly in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. While challenges like funding shortfalls, conflict, and market volatility persist, collaboration and policy interventions are crucial for ensuring a food-secure future.

\---  
Brazil's Coffee Crisis: How Trump's Tariff Impacts Farmers and Global Markets  
  
This video explores the escalating crisis facing Brazilian coffee producers, primarily small-scale family farmers, due to a new 50% tariff imposed by former President Donald Trump on Brazilian imported goods. This significant tariff is expected to dramatically reduce the price of coffee in Brazil and severely impact farmers' livelihoods.  
  
The tariff's immediate effect is a substantial decrease in the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee in the United States, which serves as Brazil's top coffee buyer, accounting for approximately 16% of its total exports. Experts, such as Leandro Gilio, a professor at Insper business school, predict a natural reduction in demand, making it challenging for Brazil to quickly re-direct its coffee production to alternative international markets. Despite this, M√°rcio Ferreira, president of Brazil's coffee exporters council Cecafe, maintains that the U.S. cannot ""give up on Brazil"" as a coffee source.  
  
The tariff's motivation is explicitly political, as stated by Donald Trump himself. He linked the measure to what he called a ""witch hunt"" trial against his ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of attempting to orchestrate a coup to overturn his 2022 election loss to Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva.  
  
Small-scale coffee producers, who cultivate over two-thirds of Brazilian coffee, are the most vulnerable to this economic shock. These family farmers typically possess less financial resilience to endure periods of falling prices or to make necessary investments. Farmers like Jose Natal da Silva from Porciuncula, who has been farming since age 12, express profound fear and anxiety, questioning how they will survive as their years of struggle seem to unravel. He owns approximately 40,000 coffee trees.  
  
The tariff compounds existing challenges already faced by Brazilian coffee farmers. They contend with an increasingly dry and unpredictable climate, which has led to devastating droughts, such as one experienced by Jose Natal da Silva that severely reduced his production the previous year. While such conditions can sometimes push prices up, small-scale farmers often sell their crops before prices peak, missing out on potential gains. Furthermore, arabica coffee prices had already fallen by 33% by July from their peak in February, adding to farmer uncertainty.  
  
Beyond the direct impact on coffee bean prices, farmers like Paulo Vitor Menezes Freitas, a 31-year-old modest coffee plantation owner from Varre-Sai, anticipate that the tariff will also inflate the cost of essential agricultural goods such as machinery and aluminum, further squeezing their already slim profit margins and increasing financial insecurity. Coffee farming demands significant hard work and long hours, with intense harvest seasons sometimes beginning at 3 a.m. and extending past midnight. In municipalities like Porciuncula and Varre-Sai, coffee farming remains the primary economic activity, underscoring the widespread local impact of this crisis. Farmers hope for a resolution and the removal of the tariff, believing it would benefit both the United States and Brazil.

1maixm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1maixm1/worn_markings_on_clear_model_not_even_2_years_old/,Worn markings on clear model not even 2 years old,"Hey everyone.  
I purchased my aeropress clear in the UK from PACT coffee at the end of november in 2023. by spring of 2024 i had noticed the markings had started to wear off. Getting to this point in time now and barely anything remains on the number 4. I am a bit disappointed that despite following all the care guidelines and it only usually being used at weekends that they have worn off so quickly!

Now yeah i appreciate that it doesn't affect the function of the AP. And that also a lot of people have commented on similar threads ""who even uses the markings?"". To me its a build quality / finishing issue. But also cosmetic to some degree. And actually i do find using the markings useful sometimes. One reason i got the clear was so i could see the level of the coffee better when brewing and that the white labels would contrast much better.

I appreciate i have probably left it waaaaay too late to sort out. And being in the UK as well might cause a snag. Our UK based website / distributor doesn't seem to offer any registration factility unlike the USA website. Which also includes a 2 year warranty i noted if you registered. I have heard some people have had success though getting a replacement from AP? but im guessing this is only in the USA.

I've contacted our UK supplier to see how i get on and i have also tried to register it via the USA website. It did recognise my location in the UK so who knows? Maybe ill have some success. I suppose an ideal outcome would be getting a brand new replacement chamber and i can just keep using the existing one until that wears out?

I do have a previous classic model that was gifted to me by a friend used to get me into brewing at home. That now has a quiet retirement at my parents house for when i visit. The chamber is getting pretty worn on that though! I could create a frankenstein clear and brown version with the spare chamber if i got one i guess haha.

Anyway. Cheers for reading, Any suggestions or stories of your own similar experiences would be welcome.

1maixfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1maixfk/stuck_in_a_relationship_rut/,Stuck in a relationship rut,"I need therapy I know, however from the UK without paying privately which I do not have the means to, the NHS is hell bent on CBT which doesn't really match my specific needs. 

I (F38) grew up in a horrible family situation, my dad and mum married young as she was pregnant at 15 and had my older sister at 16, I came next when my mum was 18, then came my younger sister when my mum was 20. My dad divorced her and then we all got neglected and then taken away from her care and me and my older sister got placed into my dads care and my younger sister was placed for adoption (turns out my mum had an affair and my younger sister was not my dads child). My dad remarried to a horrid woman who did not touch my sister but beat the living crap out of me everyday from the age of 3 to 17 when I moved out of home (my dad had also divorced her when I was 16). My mother went on to have two more children who again were taken from her care. 

I met a man when I was 15 and we dated on and off for 10yrs, the last being a 5yr stint. We had a stillborn child when I was 23yrs old - the baby was not planned and I fell pregnant on the Depo. I left him when I was 24 once and for all because he was emotionally and financially abusive. He stalked me and made my life hell for 9 months. 

I then met my current partner (M38) when I was 25yrs old. Sure he had a couple of red flags but after what I had been through, I could deal with them, after all no one is perfect right. I told him I did not want children as I don't think I am mentally capable of raising a child when I have a traumatic background, had suffered trauma from my last attempt and I also have severe emetophobia. For four years, this man agreed and was on the same page as me. We bought a house and got engaged and then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, he changed his mind, he wanted children. I said I'm not even sure if I can get pregnant, let alone want them. He said if it happens it happens, if it don't, it don't but he wanted to at least try. I had to sit and think for a long time about my situation and what I thought was best. The problem is, people like me, from my kind of background don't often get the best chances in life and I knew it. I had worked hard to make a career for myself and earn good money but I knew how fickle life can be and that scared me. So I agreed to at least try thinking it would be a difficult journey and I might be able to say, ok that's enough trying now, I can't do it anymore....oh boy....I was wrong....I fell pregnant the first time of trying, it wasn't even trying for ffs, I wasn't even tracking. I found out 4 wks before we got married. 

Fast forward to baby being born. He was more concerned that I was not putting out than the fact I had PND/PPD and kept coercing me into having sex with him. I tried to put my foot down, we had so many arguments about it. I wanted to leave him but I was in survival mode and didn't want to be left alone with a baby that I knew I couldn't care for when they were sick (baby sick surprisingly didn't effect me but when food was introduced...). I have persevered for 6yrs so far, living with a man who: 

a) thinks about his dick first

b) makes disgusting sexual jokes at every opportunity (I'm no prude but its so out of context sometimes)

c) says things like ""I earn more money and pay more of the bills so why don't you respect me more?""

d) also says things like ""I am our sons boss, he should listen to me, he should be subordinate"" 

e) does the same rotation of housework - the bits he chooses to do rather than the stuff that needs to be done outside of that

f) has the emotional intelligence of a wet sandbag, does not offer me or our son any empathy or emotional support

g) he is very defensive and does not and has not ever looked inwardly at himself

Outside of this he lives to serve, his love language is acts of service, he makes me a coffee every morning, fixes my car when its needed etc but it always comes at a price ""I did this for you though"" being a common phrase. I often say to him that his behaviour is never linear, things can be going so well and then out of nowhere he blows up because I have asked him not to do something, e.g. wind our son up. 

I can't leave him, not yet. Our son has Audhd and I can't allow him to solo parent our child for long periods without me with the attitude he has. I don't want my son suffering trauma anywhere near as close as I did. I know people say that two arguing parents can be just as bad but I don't even argue with him anymore, I just give the ""ok \[Name of husband\]"" and move on. 

I am fully aware that I made my bed and I am now laying in it. I had an opportunity to leave him long before my son and I didn't so this is just as much my fault as anyone else's. 

I guess what I am looking for is words of encouragement, an outside perspective but be gentle please. Maybe some advice on how to deal with some of the behaviour. Your experiences and how you dealt with it. 

TL:DR: Crappy back story, crappy current relationship - looking for words of encouragement on sticking in a crappy relationship until the time is right to leave or can fix current crappy relationship. ",2,1753611929.0,relationships,2,0.76,False

So, this video came into my suggested. His 15 year old daughter wrote a post complaining about her parents make her do everything, all the chores, even make her make them coffee & she never even gets paid for it. His response is to tell her how ""successful"" he was at 15, how she's almost 16 & is lazy & refuses to get a job & then shoot her laptop.

Everyone is defending the dude in the comments & calling her entitled, but he reminds me of my abusive narcissistic father. I personally think while it's 100% okay to give your teenaged children chores, this was overkill & his response was ridiculous. He also acts like she was a grown woman still living at home & not doing shit. She was literally hardly a teen; I mean 15 to me is a younger teen. Even if you think she was acting entitled or overreacting, the fact he chose to shoot her laptop speaks volumes about what kinda person he is.",2,1753611895.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,0.75,False

But just as I was about to tell him I was pr\*\*nant with our child, he dropped a bombshell.  
  
He needed me to take the fall for his childhood sweetheart, Everleigh. She'd been in a hit-and-run, and her career couldn't handle the scandal.  
  
When I refused and told him about our baby, his face went cold. He told me to terminate the pr\*\*nancy immediately.  
  
""Everleigh is the woman I love,"" he said. ""Finding out you're pr\*\*nant with my child would destroy her.""  
  
He had his assistant schedule the appointment and sent me to the clinic alone. There, the nurse told me the procedure carried a high risk of permanent infertility.  
  
He knew. And he still sent me.  
  
I walked out of that clinic, choosing to keep my child. At that exact moment, a news alert lit up my phone. It was a glowing article announcing that Ignatz and Everleigh were expecting their first child, complete with a photo of his hand resting protectively on her stomach.  
  
My world shattered. Wiping away a tear, I found the number I hadn't called in five years.  
  
""Dad,"" I whispered, my voice breaking. ""I'm ready to come home.""  
  
  
Chapter 1  
""What did you just say?""  
  
The question hung in the air of our minimalist apartment, the one I had designed. My voice was barely a wh\*\*per.  
  
Ignatz Turner, my boyfriend of five years, didn't even look up from his phone. He just repeated it, calm and matter-of-fact.  
  
""I said Everleigh needs you to take the blame. It was a hit-and-run, Gen. A minor one, nobody was seriously hurt, but her career can't handle a scandal right now.""  
  
I stared at him, at the handsome face I had loved for so long. Now, it looked like a stranger's.  
  
""You want me to say I was driving her car? That I hit someone and fled the scene?""  
  
""It makes sense,"" he said, finally lifting his eyes. They were cool, rational. ""You're a private person, an architect. You don't have a public image to protect. You can handle the heat. Everleigh... she's fragile.""  
  
My hands started to shake. ""Fragile? Ignatz, she broke the law. What about my record? My career?""  
  
""It won't affect your career,"" he said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Our lawyers will handle it. A fine, maybe some community service. It's nothing.""  
  
I felt a cold anger rise in my ch\*\*t. ""Nothing? Ignatz, do you have any idea what you're asking? I left my family for you. I gave up my name, my inheritance, everything, so we could have a normal life away from their influence. I did that for you.""  
  
""And I appreciate that, Gen, I really do,"" he said, his voice softening. He stood up and came toward me, trying to take my hands. ""That's why I know you're strong enough to do this one more thing for us. For me.""  
  
He was close now, his familiar scent filling my senses. It used to comfort me. Now it made me sick.  
  
""There's something else,"" I said, my voice trembling as I backed away from his touch.  
  
He stopped, a flicker of annoyance crossing his face. ""What now?""  
  
""I'm pr\*\*nant.""  
  
The words came out, quiet but heavy. I had just found out this morning. I had been planning a romantic dinner to tell him, to celebrate.  
  
Ignatz froze. His charming expression vanished, replaced by a look I had never seen before-a cold, hard panic.  
  
""No,"" he said.  
  
""Yes. I took a test. I'm six weeks along.""  
  
He ran a hand through his perfectly styled hair, pacing the room. ""This is a disaster. An absolute disaster.""  
  
I laughed, a broken, hollow sound. Tears I didn't know were there started streaming down my face. ""A disaster? It's your baby, Ignatz.""  
  
""Everleigh can't handle this right now!"" he snapped, turning on me. ""The stress of the accident, her anxiety... finding out you're pr\*\*nant with my child would destroy her. She's not strong like you, Gen. She needs my full support.""  
  
""So I'm the one who gets sacrificed? Again?"" The words were squeezed out from between my teeth. ""My life, my reputation, and now... our baby?""  
  
He stopped pacing and looked at me, his eyes now holding a chilling sort of pity. ""We can't have this baby. Not now.""  
  
My world tilted. The floor felt like it was dropping out from under me. ""What are you saying?""  
  
""I'm saying you need to terminate it,"" he said, his voice dropping to a low, persuasive tone. ""It's for the best. For everyone. Once this all blows over with Everleigh, we can try again. It's just... bad timing.""  
  
The air left my lungs. He was talking about our child like it was an inconvenient appointment to be rescheduled.  
  
""It's your child, Ignatz,"" I whispered, my voice hoarse. ""Your bl\*\*d.""  
  
""And Everleigh is the woman I love!"" he yelled, his composure finally cracking. ""She's sensitive! This would break her! Can't you understand that?""  
  
I just stared at him, my mind a blank wall of pain. After a long, silent moment, a sad, twisted smile formed on my lips.  
  
""Okay,"" I said. ""Okay, Ignatz.""  
  
Relief washed over his face. He didn't see the emptiness behind my eyes.  
  
Just then, his phone rang, a cheerful pop song I recognized as one of Everleigh's hits. He answered it immediately.  
  
""Leigh? Hey, baby, what's wrong? Don't cry, I'm on my way. I'm coming right now.""  
  
His voice was a gentle, loving ca\*\*ss. A voice he hadn't used with me in years.  
  
He hung up and grabbed his keys, not even glancing at me as he rushed to the door.  
  
""I'll have my assistant schedule the appointment for you,"" he said over his shoulder. ""Just do it quickly.""  
  
Then he was gone. The door clicked shut, leaving me in a silence that was louder than his shouting.  
  
The next day, I was at the clinic. The air smelled of antiseptic and quiet despair. The nurse who took my information looked at me with pity in her eyes. It made my skin crawl.  
  
She handed me a clipboard with a consent form. His signature was already there at the bottom: Ignatz Turner. He had signed it this morning, before he even knew if I'd agree. He was so sure of me.  
  
""The doctor wants you to know,"" the nurse said softly, avoiding my gaze, ""that due to a minor complication, this procedure carries a high risk of future infertility. There's a chance you might not be able to conceive again.""  
  
The clipboard slipped from my numb fingers and clattered to the floor.  
  
He knew. He must have known. The doctor would have told his assistant, and his assistant would have told him. He knew this could leave me barren, and he still signed the form. He still sent me here to erase our child and my future.  
  
I bit down on my lip, hard. The coppery taste of bl\*\*d filled my mouth, but I felt nothing. Just a vast, cold emptiness.  
  
I was ready to go through with it. To just get it over with, to cut out the last piece of him inside me. I stood up to follow the nurse.  
  
And then I felt it.  
  
A tiny, unmistakable flutter deep in my womb. It was too early for a real kick, the doctor had said. But I felt it. A flicker of life, a silent protest.  
  
Don't let me go.  
  
""No,"" I said, my voice loud and clear in the quiet room.  
  
The nurse turned, surprised.  
  
""I'm not doing it,"" I said, pulling my arm away. ""I'm keeping my baby.""  
  
I walked out of that clinic, leaving the consent form on the floor. The afternoon sun was blindingly bright, and for a moment, I felt a surge of strength. I had my baby. That's all that mattered.  
  
Then I pulled out my phone. The screen lit up with a breaking news alert from a celebrity gossip site.  
  
The headline was a punch to the gut: ""Everleigh Hooper and Boyfriend Ignatz Turner Expecting First Child! Sources say Hooper is overjoyed after a recent health scare.""  
  
The article was filled with pictures of them from last night, leaving a fancy restaurant. Ignatz was holding her, his hand placed protectively on her flat stomach. They were both smiling, glowing for the cameras.  
  
Below the article, the comments section was a sewer.  
  
""Who is that Genevieve Ball person? The one who did the hit-and-run in Everleigh's car? Probably some obsessed fan Ignatz felt sorry for.""  
  
""I heard she's been stalking him for years. Good thing he's finally with someone on his level.""  
  
""She looks so plain. Of course he chose a star like Everleigh. And now they're starting a family! So happy for them!""  
  
I bit my lip again, harder this time. I felt the skin break, the warm trickle of bl\*\*d down my chin. But I still couldn't feel the pain. I was completely numb.  
  
I looked down at my own stomach, and a single tear rolled down my cheek and fell onto my hand.  
  
""It's okay,"" I whispered to the tiny life inside me. ""I'll protect you. I promise.""  
  
I wiped my face, my expression hardening. I opened my contacts and found my lawyer's number.  
  
""I need you to draw up divorce papers,"" I said, my voice steady and cold. ""And I want everything I'm entitled to.""  
  
  
Chapter 2  
When I got back to the apartment, the front door was slightly ajar. A knot of dread tightened in my stomach. I pushed it open slowly.  
  
The sound of soft laughter drifted from the living room.  
  
There, on the custom-made sofa I had picked out, sat Everleigh Hooper. Ignatz was sitting on the coffee table in front of her, feeding her a strawberry. She giggled and leaned forward to k\*\*s him.  
  
It was a perfectly staged, in\*\*mate moment. And I had just walked in on it.  
  
Ignatz saw me first. His smile faltered for a second, his eyes hardening. ""Gen.""  
  
Everleigh looked over, her big, innocent eyes widening. She immediately shrank back against the cushions, making herself look small and scared.  
  
""Gen, can you give us a minute?"" Ignatz said, keeping his voice low, as if I were an intruder. ""Everleigh isn't feeling well. I'll come to the guest room later.""  
  
I let out a short, sharp laugh. ""The guest room? Ignatz, this is my apartment. My name is on the lease. If anyone should leave, it's her.""  
  
He stood up, his expression turning pleading. ""Please, just for tonight. You know how she is. We grew up together, I've always taken care of her. She needs me right now.""  
  
He was trying to appeal to the part of me that had always made excuses for him, for their ""special"" bond.  
  
""I'll get her a hotel tomorrow, I promise,"" he said, his voice a low murmur. ""We'll sort this out.""  
  
I didn't say another word. I just turned and walked to the spare bedroom, closing the door behind me.  
  
I couldn't block out the sounds. A few minutes later, I heard their laughter again, louder this time, mixed with the sound of the TV. They were settling in for the night. In my home.  
  
I curled up on the bed, not bothering to change. The tears I had held back all day finally came, soaking the pillow in the dark.  
  
Much later, I heard the bedroom door creak open. A shadow fell across the bed.  
  
""Gen? Are you awake?"" It was Ignatz, his voice a guilty wh\*\*per.  
  
He sat on the edge of the bed, his weight making the mattress dip. He reached out and touched my hair.  
  
""I'm sorry about today,"" he said, his voice thick. ""It's just a lot to deal with. The baby... we'll have another one, Gen. When the time is right, I swear.""  
  
I lay perfectly still, my body rigid. He didn't know. He thought I had gone through with it. He was apologizing for the inconvenience, not the monstrous thing he had asked of me. The irony was a bitter pill in my throat.  
  
Suddenly, a sharp scream came from the living room. ""Iggy! Iggy, where are you?""  
  
Ignatz shot up from the bed as if he'd been electrocuted. ""Leigh?""  
  
""I had a nightmare!"" she wailed. ""Come back!""  
  
Without a second thought, without another glance at me, he bolted from the room. ""I'm coming, Leigh! I'm here!""  
  
For the rest of the night, the sound of his low, soothing voice drifted down the hallway as he comforted her, leaving me alone in the dark.  
  
The next morning, I dragged my exhausted body out of bed. The smell of coffee and bacon filled the air. For a delusional second, it felt like any other morning.  
  
Then I walked into the kitchen.  
  
Ignatz was at the stove, flipping pancakes. Everleigh was perched on a stool, wearing one of his expensive silk shirts, her bare legs dangling. She was laughing as he playfully dabbed a bit of whipped cream on her nose.  
  
They looked like a happy couple in a coffee commercial. I was the ghost haunting the set.  
  
Everleigh saw me and her bright smile vanished. She instantly adopted her frightened-doe look, clutching Ignatz's arm. ""Oh. Genevieve. You're up.""  
  
""Iggy,"" she whispered, loud enough for me to hear. ""I want orange juice. Freshly squeezed.""  
  
""Of course, Leigh. Anything you want,"" Ignatz said, turning to the fridge without a single glance in my direction.  
  
The moment he was busy with the juicer, Everleigh's entire demeanor changed. The fear melted away, replaced by a smug, triumphant smirk. She looked directly at me.  
  
""He was so disappointed when he thought you were pr\*\*nant,"" she said, her voice a syrupy poison. ""He told me he never wanted kids with you. He said the thought of it made his skin crawl.""  
  
I froze, my hand on the counter. My head snapped up to look at her. My fingers trembled.  
  
""You think you can win?"" she continued, her voice dripping with contempt. ""I'm Everleigh Hooper. My uncle is one of the most powerful producers in Hollywood. Who are you? A no-name architect he picked up out of pity.""  
  
My bl\*\*d ran cold. I knew her uncle was influential. I hadn't realized how much. That's why Ignatz was so desperate to protect her. It wasn't just love; it was ambition. She was his ticket to a world he craved.  
  
Suddenly, Everleigh let out a sharp cry and slid off the stool, collapsing onto the floor. ""Ahh! My ankle!"" she shrieked, clutching it. ""Genevieve, why did you push me?""  
  
Ignatz spun around, his face a mask of fury. He saw me standing near her, saw her on the floor, and didn't hesitate. He lunged forward and shoved me, hard.  
  
""What the h\*\*l is wrong with you?"" he roared.  
  
I stumbled backward, my hip slamming into the corner of the kitchen island. A sharp, searing pain shot through my side. I gasped, clutching the spot.  
  
He didn't even notice. He was already on the floor, cradling Everleigh in his arms. ""Are you okay, Leigh? Did she hurt you?""  
  
He looked up at me, his eyes filled with a cold, terrifying hatred. ""She's fragile, you id\*\*t! I told you that!""  
  
""I... I didn't touch her,"" I stammered, the pain making my voice shake.  
  
""Get out of my sight,"" he snarled, his voice low and dangerous. ""Don't you ever touch her again. I'm warning you, Genevieve.""  
  
He scooped Everleigh up into his arms and carried her out of the kitchen, leaving me standing there, trembling with pain and shock.  
  
My hand went instinctively to my stomach, a silent prayer that the baby was okay.  
  
This was my home. And I had just been declared the enemy.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
Ignatz didn't come back for two days. I spent the time in a daze, moving through the silent apartment like a zombie. I took down our pictures, packing his clothes into boxes. I even took off my wedding ring. It slid off my finger with no resistance. I had lost so much weight, I hadn't even noticed.  
  
I dropped it into the tr\*\*h can. It made a dull, final thud.  
  
Then, a text message from him lit up my phone.  
  
Can you do me a favor? There's a blue velvet box in my top drawer. A courier is coming to pick it up in an hour. Have it ready for him.  
  
I went to his drawer. Inside was a small, elegant box from a famous jewelry designer. I opened it. Nestled on the black velvet was a diamond necklace, the kind of ostentatious piece I would never wear. I remembered him showing it to me online months ago.  
  
""Isn't it beautiful?"" he'd said. ""I'm going to buy it for the most important person in my life.""  
  
I had thought he meant me.  
  
Staring at the necklace, a bitter laugh escaped my lips. I closed the box.  
  
When the courier arrived, a young man in a crisp uniform, I handed him the package without a word.  
  
""Ma'am, the destination is the St. Regis Hotel,"" he said, confirming the details.  
  
""I know,"" I said, pulling my purse from the hook by the door. I took out the folded divorce agreement. ""I'm going with you.""  
  
The car ride was silent. The St. Regis was hosting a massive press conference for Everleigh's new movie. As we pulled up, I could hear the roar of the crowd and the frantic clicking of cameras.  
  
I walked into the ballroom. The noise died down instantly. Every head turned. Every camera swiveled to face me. I was wearing a simple dress and no makeup. My hair was pulled back in a messy bun.  
  
Whispers erupted around me.  
  
""Is that her? The stalker?""  
  
""What is she doing here? Look at how she's dressed. No class.""  
  
I ignored them all. My eyes were fixed on the stage at the front of the room, where Ignatz and Everleigh were standing, holding hands.  
  
Ignatz saw me, and his face tightened into a knot of anger. ""Genevieve? What the h\*\*l are you doing here?"" he hissed as I approached.  
  
I didn't answer. I just held out the blue velvet box.  
  
""You forgot this,"" I said, my voice surprisingly steady.  
  
Everleigh snatched the box from my hand and opened it with a g\*\*p of delight. ""Oh, Iggy! It's beautiful!""  
  
She turned to him, pouting. ""Put it on me. Right now.""  
  
Ignatz hesitated for a fraction of a second, his eyes darting between me and her. Then, his face hardened, and he took the necklace. His fingers brushed against her skin as he fastened the clasp.  
  
Everleigh leaned in and ki\*\*ed him full on the lips, her eyes locked on me the entire time. It was a declaration of victory.  
  
I stood there, silent.  
  
Then, she did it again. She let out a tiny g\*\*p and staggered, pretending to lose her balance. ""Oh!""  
  
""Gen, I warned you!"" Ignatz roared, lunging forward to steady Everleigh. He glared at me, his face contorted with rage. ""Are you trying to hurt her?""  
  
I said nothing. I just held out the divorce agreement I had been clutching in my hand.  
  
He barely glanced at it. Everleigh suddenly clutched her stomach. ""Iggy, I don't feel well. My stomach hurts.""  
  
""What?"" His attention snapped back to her, all thoughts of me and the papers gone. ""Okay, baby, okay. Let's get you to the hospital.""  
  
""The papers, Iggy,"" I said, holding them out again. ""Sign them.""  
  
""Just sign it so she'll leave!"" Everleigh mo\*\*ed, pressing herself against him.  
  
Without even reading it, he snatched a pen from a nearby table, scribbled his name on the line, and shoved the document back at me.  
  
Then he swept Everleigh into his arms and started pushing his way through the crowd of reporters. ""Let us through! It's an emergency!""  
  
I clutched the signed papers to my ch\*\*t and turned to leave. As I walked away, someone deliberately stuck out a foot.  
  
I went down, hard.  
  
My head hit the marble floor with a sickening crack. The world exploded in a flash of white-hot pain.  
  
I heard gasps from the crowd. Through a haze of pain, I saw Ignatz stop and look back. He took a half-step toward me, his face a mess of confusion.  
  
""Iggy, let's go!"" Everleigh whined, tugging on his arm. ""She's just faking it for attention.""  
  
He looked from me, lying on the floor with bl\*\*d starting to pool around my head, to her. He hesitated for one more second.  
  
Then he turned and left, disappearing into the flashing lights of the paparazzi.  
  
I lay there, the polished floor cold against my cheek. My vision was blurring. People were staring, whispering, pointing. No one moved to help.  
  
With a gr\*\*n, I pushed myself up. My head was spinning. I realized my wedding ring was gone. It must have flown off when I fell. The ring that had been so loose on my finger. A symbol of a marriage that had been hollow for a long, long time.  
  
I didn't even look for it.  
  
Ignoring the stares and the cameras, I stumbled to my feet, my legs shaking. I walked, one foot in front of the other, out of the ballroom and into the street.  
  
I flagged down a taxi. The driver's eyes went wide when he saw the bl\*\*d on my face.  
  
""Hospital?"" he asked, his voice full of alarm.  
  
I wiped a smear of bl\*\*d from my cheek with the back of my hand.  
  
""Yeah,"" I said, a grim smile touching my lips. ""But I'm not gonna die.""  
  
  
Chapter 4  
The emergency room doctor was gentle as she stitched the gash on my forehead. ""You need to be more careful,"" she said, her brow furrowed with concern. ""A fall like that could have been much worse, especially..."" She trailed off, glancing at my chart.  
  
Before she could finish, the TV in the corner of the waiting area, which had been murmuring quietly, suddenly blared to life with a ""Breaking News"" graphic.  
  
My face filled the screen. It was a grainy cell phone video of me on the floor of the ballroom.  
  
""Sources inside the St. Regis claim Genevieve Ball, ex-girlfriend of mogul Ignatz Turner, staged a dramatic fall today in an attempt to win him back,"" the anchor said in a grave voice. ""This comes on the heels of new reports alleging Ms. Ball has a history of erratic behavior and infidelity.""  
  
The world went dark at the edges. I gripped the side of the hospital bed to keep from fainting.  
  
Before I could even process the slander, the door to my curtained-off cubicle was thrown open with a deafening bang.  
  
Meredith Turner, Ignatz's mother, stood there, her face a mask of pure fury.  
  
""You little wh\*\*e!"" she screamed, lunging at me. Her hand connected with my cheek in a vicious slap that sent my head ringing.  
  
Before I could react, two large men, bodyguards I recognized, grabbed my arms. They hauled me off the bed, ignoring the doctor's protests.  
  
""What are you doing? She's my patient!""  
  
""Get out of the way,"" Meredith snarled at her, and they dragged me out of the hospital, my bare feet scraping against the pavement.  
  
They threw me into the back of a black SUV and drove to an old, abandoned warehouse on the industrial outskirts of the city. They dragged me inside and threw me onto the filthy concrete floor.  
  
""Kneel,"" Meredith commanded, her voice echoing in the cavernous space.  
  
I tried to scramble away, but the bodyguards forced me down. My knees hit the cold, hard ground with a painful crack.  
  
Meredith pulled out her phone and dialed. ""Ignatz,"" she said, her voice dripping with venom. ""Your pathetic wife is here, making a scene. She's brought shame on our entire family.""  
  
I could hear Ignatz's panicked voice on the other end of the line. ""Mom, what did you do? Where are you?""  
  
""Don't you worry about it,"" she sneered. ""I'm just teaching this little tramp the lesson you've been too soft to teach her. You can't be this soft, son. She's been cheating on you, playing you for a fool!""  
  
""Ignatz!"" I screamed, desperate for him to hear me. ""It's not true! I'm pr\*\*nant! She's lying!""  
  
There was a pause on the other end. Then, Ignatz's voice came through, low and defeated. ""Gen... just do what she says. I'll make it up to you later. I promise.""  
  
The line went dead.  
  
Hope died with it.  
  
They left me there, kneeling in the stifling heat of the unventilated warehouse. Sweat and bl\*\*d trickled down my face, dripping onto the dusty floor. Hours passed.  
  
Then, a sudden, sharp cramp seized my abdomen. It was a pain so intense it stole my breath. I looked down. A dark, wet patch was spreading on the thin fabric of my dress.  
  
No. No, no, no.  
  
Panic, raw and primal, clawed at my throat. I scrambled to the massive steel door and banged on it with my fists.  
  
""Help! Please, somebody help me! My baby!""  
  
I could hear Meredith's voice from the other side, cold and dismissive. ""What baby? That little ba\*\*ard? Let it die. It was never welcome in the Turner family anyway.""  
  
""It's Ignatz's baby!"" I shrieked, my voice cracking with desperation. ""It's your grandchild!""  
  
The only answer was the sound of her footsteps walking away, fading into silence.  
  
I was alone.  
  
I spent the night on that cold floor, bleeding in the dark, the pain in my belly a relentless, tearing agony.  
  
When the sun came up, the door finally opened. One of the bodyguards looked down at me, his face impassive. ""Mrs. Turner said we can take you to a hospital now.""  
  
The next thing I knew, I was on an operating table. The lights were too bright, the voices around me were muffled. I felt a profound coldness spreading through me, a sense of something precious being irrevocably lost.  
  
As they wheeled me into a recovery room, my phone, which had been in my purse, buzzed on the bedside table. It was a text from Ignatz.  
  
I'm so sorry, Gen. Mom went too far. But you have to understand her position. This has been so hard on all of us.  
  
A single, hot tear slid from the corner of my eye and traced a path through the grime on my face. My fingers trembled as I picked up the phone.  
  
A few hours later, a lawyer I didn't recognize delivered a crisp, white envelope. Inside was my divorce certificate, officially stamped. It was over.  
  
I scrolled through my contacts, my thumb hovering over a name I hadn't called in five years. A name that represented a life I had thrown away.  
  
I pressed the call button.  
  
It rang twice.  
  
""Well, look who it is,"" a deep, male voice said, laced with a familiar, teasing smile. ""I was beginning to think you'd forgotten all about me.""  
  
""Kaleb,"" I whispered, my voice breaking. ""I need help.""  
  
""I know,"" he said, his tone instantly serious. ""I'm already on my way. Dad's with me. Just hang on, Gen. We're coming to bring you home.""
