If your heart races when the news is on...
If social media leaves you feeling like you’re behind in life...
If your mind doesn’t know how to *shut up* at 3 a.m...
That’s not just in your head. This world *literally* profits from your anxiety.

You’re being hit with noise 24/7—notifications, bad news, expectations, comparison traps, productivity hacks, pressure to ""heal"" fast, glow-up, hustle, repeat.
And somewhere in the chaos, we forget the simplest truth:
**Peace isn’t found. It’s reclaimed.**

### Here’s how I started reclaiming mine. Maybe it’ll help you too.

**1. Turn down the volume (literally and emotionally).**
I muted 90% of my notifications. I unfollowed accounts that made me feel like crap.
I realized: if the first thing I consume every day is anxiety-inducing content, I’m handing over control of my mind before I even brush my teeth.

**2. Ask yourself: “Whose voice is this?”**
That inner critic? That urgency? That shame?
So much of it isn’t even *ours.*
It’s borrowed from parents, bosses, social media, capitalism.
I started pausing and asking: “Would I say this to a friend?”
If not—then why am I saying it to *me*?

**3. Let it be messy.**
Peace doesn’t mean perfect. It means *safe.*
It means not flinching at your own thoughts.
Some days, peace looks like crying in the shower.
Other days, it looks like walking barefoot outside just to *feel* something real.

**4. You don’t have to fix yourself to deserve rest.**
This one hit me hard:
You are allowed to rest *before* you burn out.
You are allowed to exist *without* being productive.
Read that again.

**5. Create micro-moments of quiet.**
Not everything has to be a 10-step morning routine.
Sit in your car before going in.
Breathe before answering that email.
Drink your coffee *without* scrolling.

Small. Human. Gentle. That’s the way back.

---

💬 **If this hit something inside you, I’d love to know:**

* What helps *you* find peace when the world won’t slow down?
* What’s one thing you want to let go of this week?

Let’s remind each other:
You are not broken. You are reacting normally to a very loud world.
And you’re allowed to come home to yourself—without guilt.

Beyond the strength I know I can physically achieve 
She makes my heart beat faster than i could ever believe 
Short in stature yet acts like she could defeat lions
Think I see our future together on the horizon
Unmatched beauty i have never seen before in my life
Her giggle alone is tempting me to make her my wife
Through the vine i hear people miss having her around more
Her smile sends me to orbit and makes my heart uproar
She studies to help make people healthy in their minds
The love she wants to share is something I was trying to find
Its overwhelming, the butterflies that I get when we flirt
I hope she is the one because otherwise this will hurt
A mystery still awaits as I still get to know her

1m2ers2,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m2ers2/the_roadkill_incident/,The Roadkill Incident,"Let me start by saying this: I'm dying. This morning was one of the most bizarre and fucked up nights anyone could ever experience. I doubt anyone will take this seriously, but I don't care. I'm posting this while I still have a chance because my time here is extremely limited. Some would call me a crazy alcoholic, but I’d bet you’ll never find me online after this. This is what happened in my house last night.
I work as a roadkill handler, I’m hired by the city to remove wildlife and other road obstructions. I’ve picked up tires, furniture, and even a refrigerator once. Most of the job, though, involves scraping, peeling, or popping the corpses of long-dead animals stuck to the asphalt like melted cheese on a hot grill. The smell of decay and hot tar lingers in the air, a constant reminder of the work that needs to be done.
Being on call means I always have to be ready for my phone to ring at the most inconvenient times. Immediately after arriving home, having a few drinks, and taking a shower, I received a call back. During family dinner, I received a call. It even happened to me in the middle of a date. 
I have one guaranteed day off with no work interruptions and another day off where I can be called if needed. Usually, Wednesday is my flexible day, while Sunday is my guaranteed day off. There are two other people in my area who do the same job, and we cover for each other if someone is sick or unavailable. This often leads to overtime and a bigger paycheck. The money is decent, and since I live alone, I don’t have many expenses.
One of those other guys is Kevin. He’s the guy they usually call for the main city area, while I deal with the countryside. After a night of too many White Russians, my boss called me at three in the morning, startling me from my heavy, drunken sleep. I ended up lying to him.
“Hello?” I rubbed my eyes.
“Hey, Partner, I’d hate to do this, but I’m getting multiple reports of something large on the side of the highway past the Chevron just outside Wraithwood.” 
I knew he would call me on a night like this. It feels almost like a sixth sense for him.  
“I’m sorry, sir, but I’ve felt like absolute dogshit all day today. I haven’t been able to get out of bed.” 
He cut me off. His words sliced through mine like a hot knife. “Well, why didn’t you call ahead to let me know?” 
“I’ve literally been asleep all day, sir. I’ll call Kevin to see if he’ll do it for me.” 
“Don’t do this again. We’re short staffed, and the longer something is on the road, the more of a hazard it is. If someone gets hurt, it’s MY ass. Let me know if Kevin will do it. Thanks.” 
He then hung up abruptly, and I could feel his irritation through the phone. It was clear he wasn’t happy with me. I was going to hear about this at the next monthly staff meeting.
I rolled onto my back, groaning in frustration. It was impossible for me to go back to sleep for at least a couple more hours. I grabbed my phone and called Kevin. His phone rang twice before he answered. He must’ve already been on the clock. 
“Hey, Ben. What’s up?” He asked. 
“I got called in to pick something up. I'm stuck sick in bed and I was wondering if you wanted to make a little extra?”  
There was a moment of silence before he responded. The sound of the eerie dead air was thick and suffocating. “Yea, I can do that. Where?” 
“It’s just down the road past the Chevron outside of Wraithwood.” 
“Did he say what it is?” 
“No sir,” I said. “He just told me it was big.” 
“Alright. Well, I hope you get to feeling better. Have any idea what’s wrong?” 
“I think I just have a cold or some sort of virus. Just been in bed all night,” I lied to him too. “And hey, Kev, can you let him know that you’ll do it? I kinda told him at short notice and, well..you know how that goes.” 
“Yea, I can do that. I’ll text him for ya. Goodnight.” 
I hung up and felt relieved that the situation was over. My shift was covered at least for now. I’d deal with the Boss later. Since I was awake and rarely had free time, I decided to make the most of it. I showered, made some coffee, and played some Playstation. 
Something wasn’t right.
After about twenty minutes of playing, an uneasiness overcame me. A chill ran over me like whispering secrets I wasn’t supposed to hear. With a sinking sensation, I realized something was very wrong. Dread pooled in the pit of my stomach, and an inexplicable sense of foreboding washed over me, as if some malevolent force had taken an interest in my little corner of the world. Then the phone rang.
The shrill ring shattered the eerie silence, echoing through the room like a warning bell tolling in the dead of night. My heart skipped a beat as I stared at the innocuous device, its screen illuminating the darkened room with an ominous glow. As I picked it up, to my absolute confusion, it was Kevin. I dreaded the thought that he had changed his mind and left whatever it was there. What he would proceed to tell me would change the course for the rest of my short life. 
“Hey, what's up?” I asked nervously. 
“Hey, I need you to look at this.” His voice was shaky, sounding terrified. 
Within seconds, a picture was sent to my phone. I put him on speaker and opened up the text. I had no clue what I was looking at. I couldn't tell if the thing had been disfigured from the impact, or if the image was just bad quality.  
It had gray skin, like a pig’s, with blue veins and bruises covering most of its body. Its head had a beak-like structure and large, dark eyes. Pointy ears with tufts of hair protruding out. Its feet were clawed, therapod-like, curled up as it lay there. The sight was truly disturbing. Kevin had to say my name multiple times to snap me out of my confused stupor. Nothing in the picture made sense and my mind couldn’t fathom it at all. 
“What the fuck?” I mouthed to myself. 
“I’m still going to grab it. How do I even report this? Do I check off deer?” 
He genuinely sounded frightened, and I didn’t blame him, considering he was actually there looking at the damned thing. 
“It could be a partially decomposed deer.” I said to him, trying to calm him down. But I knew that wasn’t the case. I had no idea what it was. 
“I don’t feel good at all, man.” He said in a croaky, hoarse voice.
“What do you mean?” 
“I’m nauseous. I..need..to sit down in my truck.”
I sat up and started making my way to the front door. Placing the phone between my ear and my shoulder, I put my boots on. “Hold on,” I stood up grabbing my keys. “I’m on the way.”
In hindsight, it might have been a stupid idea. I couldn’t leave him out there alone feeling the way he did. He really sounded ill, and I felt compelled to help him out. I hung up, and stepped outside. It was still dark and I could see my neighbor Bob Reynolds watering his flowers. He's always up this early in the morning messing with his lawn. The flowers were not happy. They were slouching and losing color. I waved at him as I got to my truck.
“How are you doing this morning Ben?” He yelled from across the way waving back.
“Gotta go to work. The usual. Can’t get those flowers to stand up?”
“I swear these fuckin things make me want to shoot myself.” He replied, putting a finger gun to his temple. 
I laughed, “Well you have a wonderful morning, Bob!” I started my truck, reversed out and headed in Kevin’s direction. 
After fifteen minutes of driving through the pitch black night, the Chevron emerged in the distance. Its neon lights flickering erratically and casting shadows with an eerie, pulsating glow. Further down the road, Kevin’s red hazards blinked ominously in the darkness. As I slowed my truck to a crawl, I could see the creature lying there. It was even uglier in person; I was shaken, barely able to make out most of its features. I pulled up behind his truck, flipped on my hazards, stepped out and approached his driver side window. 
He was sitting there asleep, resting his forehead on the steering wheel and was breathing heavily. I tapped the glass a couple of times with no success and shouted his name, but he didn’t respond. Eventually, I decided to open the door and shake him awake. He lifted his head, barely able to pry open his eyes, which seemed to be glued shut. Sweat poured down his brow, and he was as white as a ghost. 
“Kev,” I said, trying to bring him back to the present. 
He started to open his eyes, their gleam reflected the moonlight through the slits. With a hoarse whisper he uttered, “Mom?” 
I shook him a little more, “No it's Ben.”
His eyes finally opened completely and he acknowledged me.
“Oh..yeah..thats right. I thought you were sick.”
“I lied. I have to help you get this off the road. It can’t stay here.” 
He stepped out of his truck and tossed his coat into the passenger seat. Opening up his backseat door and grabbed a bottle of water from a large pack he keeps back there. He chugged the whole thing down within ten seconds. “I was starting to think I caught something from you. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me.” He said, leaning against his truck. “I was feeling fine all day until I got here, in the middle of our phone call. I think I need a doctor.” 
I retrieved my flashlight and gloves from my center console. I put them on and clicked the light. “I don’t know what's wrong either, but we’ll get you to a hospital as soon as we figure out what to do with this. It could be an endangered species, a new one, or foreign. Let's throw it in my truck, go to my house, and I’ll make some calls. We can’t let anyone see this thing. After that we’ll get you to a doctor.” 
He nodded with whatever energy he had. I knew lifting this thing was going to wear him out completely, so we waited a few minutes for him to gather up his strength. Eventually the time had come. 
I hadn't been anywhere near the thing since I showed up, and now it was time to get up close and personal. With my flashlight, I headed towards the carcass. Kevin followed behind me, albeit slowly, his footsteps dragging. My flashlight illuminated the fog line to my left as we approached the abomination. 
A few steps forward and there it was. My god, it was horrid, heinous, vile, and despicable. This was not a deer. It had feet with claws, similar to a raptors. Its face was detestable. Its gray skin glistened in the moonlight, tufts of hair danced in the wind. It was about the size of a Great Dane, and its head was..unusual? Its skull appeared exposed, with what seemed like eye sockets on top. Two black orbs lay in those holes catching the beam of my flashlight as if it were looking right at me. Rows upon rows of jagged teeth lined its mouth, resembling those of a Mako Shark. It lacked lips, with the teeth protruding prominently. 
“You okay, Kev?” I asked him. 
“I don’t know,” he replied, making his way to the other side of the creature. “Let's get this done with.” 
I opened up the bed of my truck, opened up the toolbox and pulled out the blue tarp. I hopped back down and spread it across the bed like a blanket. Placing the handle of the flashlight in my mouth, I leant over and grabbed the thing by its back legs while Kevin took the front. On the count of three, we hoisted it into the bed of my truck. It landed with a thump, the tarp crinkling and shifting. I proceeded to fold the tarp over the corpse and shut the bed. When I turned around Kevin was gone. Mildly confused, I soon heard gagging sounds. He had wandered about ten feet into the grass and was violently throwing up. 
When he finished, he stood up, his knees wobbling, and then he collapsed. He passed out. Dropping like a sack of potatoes. Thankfully, he landed in the grass and didn’t hit his head. 
I rushed my way over to him and noticed he was still somewhat conscious. 
“My god!” I exclaimed. 
I grabbed his hand helping him up. He leaned on my shoulder as we made our way to the truck, dragging his feet behind and mumbling things I couldn’t understand. I could’ve sworn I heard him say, “Mom” a few times. 
We reached the passenger door of my truck, I opened the door, and leaned the seat back so he could lie down. He moaned and groaned, holding his stomach as I clicked the seatbelt on. I shut the door and walked around to the driver's side. On my way, I started to feel nauseous. I placed my hand on the back of the truck and leaned over to take a moment. This was utterly intense. I’ve never felt anything like it before. Not even after my worst nights after heavy drinking. I shook it off and continued on my way. Once I got to the seat, I started the truck and put it in drive. I drove away, and since the road was empty, I made a U-turn. I needed gas, so I planned to stop by the Chevron for a quick fill-up. Kevin's red hazard lights flashed in the rearview mirror, their eerie glow pulsing like a heartbeat in the dark, deserted night. 
When we got there, I pulled up to pump three and turned the truck off. Kev was asleep and hadn't moved or said anything for a while. As I opened the door to get out, I heard a crackling sound coming from the bed. There was no wind. The noise grew louder, sending chills down my spine as I glanced back, feeling a cold dread creep over me.
I paused for a moment thinking my mind was playing tricks on me, but I swear I saw it move in my peripheral. Lifting up a corner of the tarp, I took a peek at it. 
It was still dead. 
I shrugged it off. I wasn’t feeling great, and maybe I just wasn’t paying attention to the weather. However, I noticed the gas station lights strobing riotously, as if they were about to burst. I walked to the front entrance of the store. 
I opened the door, and an electronic bell rang, but it sounded broken. It was like a toy with low batteries, starting with a high-pitched ding that quickly depreciated before cutting off abruptly, leaving an eerie silence in its wake. 
The clerk was behind the counter, leaning over with his head in his hands, looking pale. I walked over to the medicine aisle and grabbed some Dramamine. When I returned to the counter, the clerk was now looking up at me, his eyes glassy and unfocused, as if he were staring right through me.
“That be it?” He asked faintly. 
“No,” I slid him a twenty on the counter, “Need fifteen on three.” 
He struggled to grab the money, but he was able to make the transaction. Out of vertiginous curiosity, I asked him, “You okay?” 
“I don’t know,” he replied softly. “I don’t know what’s wrong. Everyone that’s come in the past few hours have been sick too. Maybe there’s an epidemic? Maybe I caught something from someone?” 
He handed me my change, “I tried to call for a paramedic, but the phones aren’t working. Not even my cell.” 
I pulled my phone out of my pocket, but the screen wouldn't stay still. Anytime I tried to click on something, it would jumble and flash like technical diarrhea. It didn’t make sense; I’d never seen it act like that before. The clerk's phone was doing the same. He looked up from his device, his voice shaky. “Maybe I’ll shut the store down and drive myself to the hospital. I suggest you get a move on, sir. Whatever is causing this interference hasn’t affected the pumps.” 
The fluorescent lights above flickered as if echoing his words, casting unsettling shadows on his face. He seemed to grow paler by the second, his eyes darting nervously to the darkened corners of the store. I snatched my medicine off the counter and offered him a pill, which he gladly took. I told him to get better and hurried to the pump. Quickly, I pumped the gas and started the truck. I took off back towards my house, the engine's growl the only sound in the eerie stillness of the night. As I drove, the shadows on the empty road seemed to dance and stretch unnaturally, as if alive. 
After about fifteen minutes, I started to feel dizzy. As I pulled into my driveway, I opened the door and threw up on the concrete. The acid taste lingered, and the night air did little to clear my head. I shut the door and glanced over at Kevin. He was still asleep next to me, looking as pale as a sheet. His breathing was shallow, and every exhale seemed to be an effort. He wasn’t doing well, and neither was I. Anxiety filled my chest, making me feel worse. The oppressive silence around the house was almost palpable, the shadows cast by the porch light seemed to crawl and twist on their own. I tightened my grip on the steering wheel and took some breaths to get my bearings. The air was thick, almost stifling, with a sense of foreboding that gnawed at the edges of my mind.
I shook Kevin, but he didn’t wake, just kept breathing heavily. I pushed him again, and he started to shuffle around, sweat dripping from his brow. His shirt was soaked, and he was as hot as a skillet. He then startled me so much that I almost punched him in the face out of a knee-jerk reaction.
When he finally opened his eyes and looked at me, they bulged out of his head, and he let out a shrill scream. He started to look behind me, grabbing at me as if I was a human shield. He wouldn’t stop. 
“Kev!” I shouted. “It’s Ben! Calm down!” 
There was a moment of struggle, but after around thirty seconds of him panicking, I managed to grab onto his wrists and make him relax. He started to cry. I got out, opened up the garage door, and pulled in. Once the truck was parked, I closed the door and secured the electronic lock. The carcass and the blue tarp still lay in the bed of the vehicle. Walking over to Kevin’s side, I opened the door for him. He just sat there, looking off absent-mindedly. 
	“C’mon, man,” I said weakly. “We gotta go in and figure out what we’re gonna do.” 
	He still sat there. Looking like a frightened toddler too scared to walk into the funhouse. He dreaded any movement in his vision. “I saw her, Ben.” 
	“Who?” I asked.
	“My mother.” 
“What do you mean?” I asked, reaching my hand out to help him. He obliged and managed to stand, though he nearly fell over from weakness. With my support, he was able to walk with me. 
“She died when I was a kid,” he said softly as we made our way to the door leading into my house. “I was eight, and we got into a car accident. Someone t-boned the car on her side. I passed out when it happened. I remember waking up on a paramedic gurney.” He paused again as we walked into the house. He started to sniffle, tears welling up. I shut the door behind us and led him to the couch. 
“All I could do was ask for my mom. ‘Where is my mom? Give me my mom!’ But everyone ignored me. They just told me to calm down and put an oxygen mask on my face,” his voice trembling, “I sat up and saw her black Dodge Stratus completely totaled.” Tears streamed down his face as he sat on the couch. “I saw her body still in the driver's seat. Her skull was split in half vertically, and her left eye was dangling out by the nerve. She was looking right at me. I swear her other eye blinked! The paramedics just pushed me back down, and I couldn’t react. I didn’t even remember it happened until therapy when I turned sixteen after misbehaving at school. I saw her just now, Ben.” 
I was shocked. I only knew Kevin as a coworker and I didn’t really know anything personal about him until now. We never hung out or spent time together outside of work; we just helped each other out on the job occasionally. But hearing all this, things started to make sense. He was always quiet and reserved, always lost in his thoughts. It seemed like he worked all the time to keep his mind occupied. 
He continued. “I loved her. I never had anybody else since then. I’ve been fucked up ever since that day. I should’ve never looked up.” He lay his head in his hands and he sobbed. 
I sympathized with him. I’ve never been through anything like that, but I understood his pain. Suddenly he shouted.
“She was just behind you in the garage! Just crouched in the corner smiling! It wasn’t her! I look at pictures of her every night before I go to bed, and that was not her face! It looked like someone else was wearing her face! Split fucking skull and everything! The voices too. Oh my god, Ben. The voices don’t fucking stop!” His voice cracked with fear and desperation. 
I was confused. Was he having fever dreams? It made sense since his temperature was super hot. But the way he freaked out in the garage, he was awake. Fully lucid. I know he was because he acknowledged me and looked at me right in the eyes when he was done. Sleep paralysis? Couldn’t be, because he was moving and grabbing at me manically. Hallucinations with a fever dream are common, but why did his visions seem so vivid? 
“Voices?” I asked. “I don't hear anything.” I tried to keep him calm, but he was genuinely freaking me out. Was this going to happen to me? I was slowly but progressively feeling worse every minute. The Dramamine I picked up helped with my nausea, so I gave him a pill and some extra strength Tylenol with a glass of water. 
He chugged the water, his eyes half closed as he looked at me and said, “They’re just speaking gibberish. I don’t know what they’re saying. It sounds like English, but they have an effect on them, like sound mixing in music panning from ear to ear. It’s super freaky.” He placed his glass on my coffee table with a loud clunk that echoed through the house. He didn’t mean to make it so loud; he just doesn’t have much control over his body. “Well, let's get this shit done so I can get to a doctor.” 
Just then, the TV flipped on with an EAS message. The AI voice trailing behind.
“Warning: Nuclear plant leak detected in your area. Please remain calm and stay indoors. DO NOT use the telephone unless absolutely necessary to help keep cell and landlines open for emergencies.” 
Kevin and I looked at each other wide-eyed and confused. How could that be possible? The plant had never had a leak before in my lifetime. It’s heavily monitored and consistent. Have we been poisoned? The clerk at the gas station too? Everyone else? He guessed an illness had been going around, so does that mean it was going on all night without being announced until now, at almost six a.m? 
“Ben, what the fuck is going on?” 
“I don’t know.” I stepped aside and walked into the kitchen. “I’m going to try and call for help.” 
I pulled my phone out of my pocket, but nothing had changed. Even my house phone was useless. Calling for help was impossible. The screen flashed and jumbled so much that I thanked God I wasn't epileptic. It was a nightmare to look at. 
Kevin started to slouch further into the couch, holding his head and groaning. My head started to pound as well, a million knives lodging into my temples. My temperature was up too; my skin was on fire. My mouth was as dry as bone. I got myself a glass of water, and as a result of drinking it too fast I choked. Covering my mouth, I noticed red droplets. 
Blood.
I rushed into the bathroom next to the garage entrance and looked in the mirror. I looked terrible. White as a marshmallow, eyes sunken in, and sweat dripping down my temples. I opened my mouth to take a look and saw my gums bleeding. Not a lot, but enough to spray droplets out of my mouth. Then I heard Kevin in the living room shout, “Oh my god!” Peeking around the corridor, I saw him with wads of his hair in his hands, pulling it out. It didn’t look painful, it was just falling out everytime he grabbed it. 
In these moments, a loud crash came from the inside of the garage. 
It sounded like metal objects clattering to the floor, startling us both. We looked at each other, and surprisingly, Kev stood up. He looked like he was about to faint, so I motioned for him to sit back down. I reached under the couch and pulled out my shotgun. A Stoeger Double Defense twelve gauge, already loaded. I slid two more shells into my coat pocket, and headed toward the door. 
I slowly opened it, lifting my gun as I did so. It squeaked loudly, echoing my own sense of unease. Flipping on the light, I watched it flicker with uncertainty before finally illuminating the garage. My toolbox lay on the floor, tools scattered about, and a slimy fluid coated the ground, glistening like oil and leaving a trail. It led from the back of my truck, the blue tarp draped over the tailgate logo. As I took in the sight I started to hear a squishy sound. It was unlike anything I’d ever heard before, seemingly all around the two car garage. 
My gaze followed the slime trail, leading me to dread the implications. No. No, it can’t be. It was dead. I cautiously approached the bed of the truck and peered inside. 
The carcass was not there. 
The squishing grew louder, more prevalent, accompanied by a low-pitched gurgle emanating from beneath. The next thing I did, still haunts me. 
I crouched and took a peek. 
The stench was unbearable, forcing me to breathe through my mouth as I gripped the shotgun tightly. I saw it. There, floundering like a fish out of water. It’s face…oh god. Its face was just as horrifying as before, and as it noticed me, it looked directly at me. I swear there was recognition behind its dark, spheroid eyes, and for a moment, it smiled at me. 
Its jagged, nasty teeth made unsettling sounds as they curled around its mouth. Then it began convulsing, a sickening mix of bones breaking and mending. I panicked and ran. In hindsight, I should’ve taken the chance to shoot it, but fear overwhelmed me. My instinct to flee was quicker than my instinct to fight. It made rippling, gasping noises as I sprinted up the small steps, slamming the door and locking it. 
I walked further into the kitchen, turned to face the door with my gun ready, and collapsed onto the floor. I couldn’t hold it any longer. I vomited violently, blood streaking through the mess like a disturbed watercolor painting. Kevin stumbled into the kitchen, leaning against the wall for support. His hair was now patchy, about forty percent of his hair was gone. “What the fuck was that?” he asked, his voice trembling with confusion. 
I wiped my mouth and held the shotgun up facing the door. “That goddamned thing is alive!” 
“What?” 
“It’s fucking alive! It’s in there!” 
His eyes widened in shock and turned his head towards the garage. The silence was deafening, each moment stretching out painfully. He slid down the wall, sinking to the floor in shock and exhaustion. Minutes dragged by as we waited anxiously, expecting the creature to slam into the door or attempt to break through in some way. But nothing happened. The first light of dawn began to filter through the windows, casting long shadows across the kitchen. Exhaustion weighed heavily on us both. My eyelids drooped, and I found myself slowly lowering my gun, dozing off.

The true grit of a late-night bar is sharp. You work long. You push tickets. You taste the whole list. You learn what hangs in a pour. Then you meet Amari. They hold a world in one glass. They bite back. They give relief. They make a shift feel new.

Amaro means bitter in Italian. It covers a range of herbal liqueurs that combine sweet and bitter notes. For chefs and bar managers, this is a tool, not a toy. A tool to deepen your menu. A tool to drive guest checks. You need to know the patterns and the rules that don’t feel like rules.

Aperitivo Amari is the first call. Campari is the icon. It arrived in 1860 and has an ABV of 24 percent². It glows red in a Negroni. It wakes the room when you build a spritz. Aperol came in 1919. It has 11 percent ABV and a soft bite¹. It slides across trays with fizz and orange. These two set the tone for your front of house.

Fernet Amari represents a subcategory of amaro, with Fernet-Branca as the most iconic example. Born in 1845³, it smells of camphor and tastes of myrrh. It sinks into the long pull and heals the burn of a long night. Other Fernet examples include Luxardo Fernet. These bottles beg for coffee and last calls.

Light and medium Amari bridge the gap from sweet vermouth to full bitter. Montenegro is widely regarded as the gateway. It started in 1885 and uses 40 herbs and spices⁴. Nonino came later with grappa roots. Averna traces back to 1868 and stands on lemon and pomegranate notes¹. These are the tools for the craft cocktail wave in your restaurant.

Carciofo Amari brings artichoke to the task. Cynar led the line in 1952⁵. While historically marketed with digestive benefits, this is more a nod to its branding than proven health science. It grinds flavor into a dark body. It mixes in a stout pour or stands neat when you need a moment of calm.

Alpine Amari carries the notes of high places. Braulio was born in 1875². It tastes of pine and menthol. It chills the palate like a mountain breeze. You serve it straight or with soda when the heat torments your patio service.

Rabarbaro Amari uses dried rhubarb roots and smoke to cut through the swirl. Zucca and Cappelletti versions line the back bar. They anchor late shift hours with fire in their flesh.

Vino Amari rides in on wine, not grain. Cardamaro uses Moscato vines. It tastes like a red vermouth with bitter bones. It slips into a Negroni or a Manhattan with ease.

The task of a restaurant leader is to know these types and to decide where they earn their keep. You can build a tasting flight that feels like an event. You can train staff on why Montenegro is not Fernet. You can teach a chef how to cook with amaro in glazes or pan sauces. The bitter world of Amari is not a trend. It is age-old. It is now.

If you aim to lift your bar game, you must aim at the Amari shelf. Then you must learn each bottle and each style. You must build a system for when to pour neat and when to mix deep. If your post service feels like repetition and fatigue, you need a shot of a new spirit.

Amari will not let your job get stale. They demand you press further. They teach you to see the rim of a glass as a map, not a limit. And they repay your work with a measure of depth that no simple spirit can yield.

Bear the grit of your kitchen in mind. Bring the tact of your service to the bar. Then pour a true Italian bitter. Watch how a diner’s eyes shift in that first sip. That is the moment you own.

## Key features Analysis

The best retro photo albums of 2025 combine vintage aesthetics with modern durability and functionality.

**Cover Material and Design:** The cover material is a crucial aspect, contributing considerably to the album's retro charm and longevity. Expect to see a range of options, from genuine leather with embossed detailing and aged textures to sturdy, cloth-bound covers featuring classic patterns like floral prints, geometric designs, or iconic travel motifs. The albums often incorporate metal accents like corner protectors or clasps to enhance the vintage feel. Stitching detail is an notable aspect to consider, as albums with high-quality stitching along the spine and edges are more durable and aesthetically pleasing.

**Page Type and Capacity:** The page type dictates the album's suitability for different photo formats and preservation needs. Many retro albums feature thick, acid-free paper to prevent yellowing and deterioration of photos over time.Some albums offer self-adhesive pages, allowing for easy placement and repositioning of photos without the need for glue or photo corners. Others use slip-in pockets designed to accommodate standard photo sizes like 4x6 or 5x7 inches. Capacity varies widely, with albums ranging from holding 100 to 600 photos or more, based on the page size and number of pages.

**Binding Style and Construction:** The binding style affects the album’s durability and ease of use. Traditional book-bound albums offer a classic, timeless look, but may not lay completely flat when open. Ring-bound or spiral-bound albums provide more flexibility, allowing pages to be easily added, removed, or rearranged.

Many provide photo corners in retro colors to allow one to avoid using glue on beloved photos. alternatives like washi tape are making a big splash as well to add a customized artistic flair.

## FAQs Section

Common questions about retro photo albums answered.

**What photo sizes will these albums accommodate?**
Most retro photo albums are designed to hold standard photo sizes like 4x6 inches, 5x7 inches, and 3x5 inches. Some albums may also have larger pages or pockets that can accommodate 8x10 inch photos or other irregularly sized prints. Be sure to check the album's specifications to ensure it can accommodate your desired photo sizes. some of the more boutique and bespoke offerings will allow for customizable sizing options as well.

**Are self-adhesive or photo corner albums better for long-term photo preservation?**
Both self-adhesive and photo corner albums can be suitable for long-term photo preservation, provided you choose high-quality, acid-free materials. Self-adhesive pages offer convenience, but it's critically important to ensure the adhesive is archival-safe and won't damage your photos over time. Photo corners provide a non-adhesive mounting option that is gentle on photos, but they require more effort to apply and may not be as secure as self-adhesive pages. archival-quality glue is another mounting option that can be just as safe for photos as photo corners if applied correctly.

**How should I store my retro photo album to prevent damage?**
To prevent damage, store your retro photo album in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight, heat, and humidity. avoid storing it in an attic, basement, or other areas with fluctuating temperatures or moisture levels. Keep the album away from dust, pests, and other potential contaminants. Consider using a protective slipcase or box to further shield the album from damage.

**Is it still possible to add notes and captions if using a self-adhesive album?**
Yes, it is still possible to add notes and captions to self-adhesive albums. Use acid-free pens or markers to write directly on the pages, or create separate labels or tags that can be attached to the photos. Be mindful of the adhesive when writing near the photo, and avoid pressing to hard, as this can cause damage to the adhesive layer.

The true grit of a late-night bar is sharp. You work long. You push tickets. You taste the whole list. You learn what hangs in a pour. Then you meet Amari. They hold a world in one glass. They bite back. They give relief. They make a shift feel new.

Amaro means bitter in Italian. It covers a range of herbal liqueurs that combine sweet and bitter notes. For chefs and bar managers, this is a tool, not a toy. A tool to deepen your menu. A tool to drive guest checks. You need to know the patterns and the rules that don’t feel like rules.

Aperitivo Amari is the first call. Campari is the icon. It arrived in 1860 and has an ABV of 24 percent². It glows red in a Negroni. It wakes the room when you build a spritz. Aperol came in 1919. It has 11 percent ABV and a soft bite¹. It slides across trays with fizz and orange. These two set the tone for your front of house.

Fernet Amari represents a subcategory of amaro, with Fernet-Branca as the most iconic example. Born in 1845³, it smells of camphor and tastes of myrrh. It sinks into the long pull and heals the burn of a long night. Other Fernet examples include Luxardo Fernet. These bottles beg for coffee and last calls.

Light and medium Amari bridge the gap from sweet vermouth to full bitter. Montenegro is widely regarded as the gateway. It started in 1885 and uses 40 herbs and spices⁴. Nonino came later with grappa roots. Averna traces back to 1868 and stands on lemon and pomegranate notes¹. These are the tools for the craft cocktail wave in your restaurant.

Carciofo Amari brings artichoke to the task. Cynar led the line in 1952⁵. While historically marketed with digestive benefits, this is more a nod to its branding than proven health science. It grinds flavor into a dark body. It mixes in a stout pour or stands neat when you need a moment of calm.

Alpine Amari carries the notes of high places. Braulio was born in 1875². It tastes of pine and menthol. It chills the palate like a mountain breeze. You serve it straight or with soda when the heat torments your patio service.

Rabarbaro Amari uses dried rhubarb roots and smoke to cut through the swirl. Zucca and Cappelletti versions line the back bar. They anchor late shift hours with fire in their flesh.

Vino Amari rides in on wine, not grain. Cardamaro uses Moscato vines. It tastes like a red vermouth with bitter bones. It slips into a Negroni or a Manhattan with ease.

The task of a restaurant leader is to know these types and to decide where they earn their keep. You can build a tasting flight that feels like an event. You can train staff on why Montenegro is not Fernet. You can teach a chef how to cook with amaro in glazes or pan sauces. The bitter world of Amari is not a trend. It is age-old. It is now.

If you aim to lift your bar game, you must aim at the Amari shelf. Then you must learn each bottle and each style. You must build a system for when to pour neat and when to mix deep. If your post service feels like repetition and fatigue, you need a shot of a new spirit.

Amari will not let your job get stale. They demand you press further. They teach you to see the rim of a glass as a map, not a limit. And they repay your work with a measure of depth that no simple spirit can yield.

Bear the grit of your kitchen in mind. Bring the tact of your service to the bar. Then pour a true Italian bitter. Watch how a diner’s eyes shift in that first sip. That is the moment you own.

1m2ekfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1m2ekfy/reflux_overfeeding_3_week_old/,Reflux / overfeeding 3 week old?,"Hi all, 

I am worried I am causing my newborn’s spitting up by either overfeeding, not burping him well enough, or maybe by something I’m eating. I know all newborns spit up, but mine seems to spit up 2-4 times after eating no matter how long I hold him up after eating. Holding him upright and continually trying to burp him for 45 mins to an hour of a 2-2.5 hour feeding cycle and still getting so much spit up is really concerning to me. It makes it hard to do things like tummy time and getting his naps in. I never had supply issues, but after some trial and error in the first days I ended up getting into a rhythm of breastfeeding on one side for about 13-15 minutes for each feeding with him and then burping him. I tried switching and burping in between but he spit up so much afterwards that it seemed that I was overfeeding. He gained weight well just eating off one side. When we stop, he either unlatches himself or I notice that his sucking is inconsistent and very light and take him off. Could I be letting him stay on the breast too long? Should I be taking him off earlier, trying to burp him, then letting him continue? 13-15 minutes already feels like such a short amount of time compared to what all of the official advice is about feeding. 

I also have a really hard time getting a good burp out of him, but even when I do, it seems that he still spits up when I lay him flat. He doesn’t seem uncomfortable when he spits up or when burping, but he is uncomfortable working gas out / pooping. Any advice for dealing with gas is appreciated. 

Also, I’ve started drinking coffee again and I’m worried that caffeine could be causing this. Does anyone have experience with that?

1m2ejqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeHive/comments/1m2ejqx/can_you_use_distilled_water_in_a_keurig/,Can you use distilled water in a Keurig?,"After using my Keurig coffee maker for years, I've learned a lot about proper maintenance and care. One question that kept coming up was about using distilled water, so I decided to dive deep into this topic and share what I discovered.

The short answer is: You shouldn't use distilled water in your Keurig coffee maker. While it might seem like the purest option, it's actually not the best choice for your machine. Here's why:

Distilled water lacks minerals that are essential for proper brewing and machine function. These minerals help trigger the sensors in your Keurig that detect water levels. Without them, your machine might not work correctly or could even display error messages.

I learned this the hard way when I tried using distilled water in my Keurig (https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers). The coffee tasted flat and lacked the full-bodied flavor I was used to. The minerals in regular water actually contribute to the extraction process and help develop better coffee flavor.

Instead of distilled water, here's what I recommend:

1. Filtered tap water
2. Spring water
3. Bottled water (not distilled)

If you're concerned about mineral buildup, regular descaling is the answer. I descale my Keurig every 3-4 months using the official Keurig descaling solution or a mixture of white vinegar and water.

Some people worry about hard water damage, but modern Keurig machines (which you can check out here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers) are designed to handle regular tap water. They come with built-in water filters that remove chlorine and other impurities while keeping the beneficial minerals.

Here's what I do to maintain my machine:
- Use filtered tap water
- Change the water filter every 2 months
- Descale regularly
- Clean the needle and pod holder monthly

These simple steps have kept my Keurig running perfectly for years, producing great-tasting coffee without any issues. The key is finding the right balance between water quality and machine maintenance.

Remember, while distilled water might seem like a good idea, it's better to stick with filtered tap water or spring water. Your coffee will taste better, and your machine will thank you for it.",1,1752775214.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

Oasis. SOMA Beer. IPA - New England / Hazy. 6% alc.
Very fine and creamy, it becomes richer and richer as it cools down. Tropical notes of ripe mango, citrus, and lime. Drinkable to the fullest. SOMA always delivers.

Desalojos son Disturbios. Pyrene Brewing Co. Porter - Imperial / Double. 8.5% alc.
An interesting Imperial Baltic porter. Roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate, caramel, wood, and a very spicy note. Black pepper. Bitter, intense, rich.

Zukua. Naparbier. Pale Ale - New England / Hazy. 5.5% alc.
Pineapple, mango, a hint of citrus. Personally, I think it lacks character. It's fine and easy to drink, but it's nothing special and quite overrated.

I first saw Clementine 5 years ago.

She was getting out of her car, and happened to drop her bag of groceries. Apples, cans, and coffee creamer all rolled down the sidewalk as she sighed to herself.

In any normal situation, I would have stopped to help her immediately.

But I was still.

Watching her brown ringlets fall in her face as she reached down to pick up the fallen fruit, her satisfied smile when she retrieved the last item, she was the most precious thing I had ever seen. And when she looked up and seemed to smile embarrassed at me watching her, I was done for.

And 5 years later, she still takes my breath away.

Every morning, she makes her coffee using the classic coffee pot. No keurig for her. Her cat mug filled to the brim as she adds a spoonful of sugar and a splash of creamer. And every morning, she smiles into the mug before she takes a sip.

“Ahhhh.. Sweet nectar..”, she sighs.

And I chuckle every time.

She always plays her music in the morning, loud. She loves Fleetwood Mac in the morning, and Lana Del Ray at nighttime. She sings softly while she makes lunch, wiggling her hips back and forth to the beat.

She’s the star in her own show, and mine.

When she logs on to get her work done, it’s almost painful to keep myself back. To not distract her, especially when she’s in focus mode.

She truly is a gem, a precious jewel.

When her girlfriends call, she happily makes plans with them, and I always think she should. It’s important to have friendships, especially healthy ones.

And when she comes home, I can always tell how the night went from how happy she is. If she comes in pink-cheeked and humming, it was a good night. If she’s growling to herself, maybe not so much.

When she finally crashes on the couch, I brush the hair out of her eyes.

My perfect girl.

I watch her sleep, watch her brows furrow as she dreams.

I smile.

I pull a box out of my shorts and open it, admiring the dazzling ring I bought a year ago.

It’s almost time for our life to begin.

It’s almost time for me to introduce myself to her.",1,1752775087.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I live in a state that doesn't believe in that type of thing, so it's been hard within my family and community to find people that have experience with making this a long term and sustainable change.

That being said.... I would love some places to get some simple recipes that I can whip together really quick after work. I can get executive dysfunction and sometimes have an issue with finishing preparing/cooking a meal that takes longer than throwing it in a pan and leaving it. I suffer from high functioning depression and hit a mental wall ALOT.

I have been googling and looking around and everyone in there mom equates low carb to KETO.... I don't want KETO, it's frustrating for me trying to start from square one. I've genuinely become so upset just seeing the word.

I know that was a lot but I think most of everyone here can remember the frustration when first starting out, especially well into adulthood.

Any tips or advice would be appreciated! 

Some notes: I work full time in retail so sometimes it isn't possible for me to take my meals at the same time everyday, let alone check my sugar. I've been doing my best checking as soon as I wake up and at least 2 or 3 hours after my last meal/before bed. 

I am starting to do exercise in small bursts

I don't drink anything but water after about 8:30pm

I'm about to cut out energy drinks (java monsters) and significantly cut back on my coffee intake (I need creamer to like it)

And due to the nature of my job as a barista and my daily activity, I get over 10,000 steps a day. My monthly average so far for June and July since I started there has been about 10,000 steps.

I get a free employee meal and a free coffee each day that I work.

But even though I try to eat mindfully, I’m obviously going to try the pastries. Due to birthdays and other celebrations, I’ve been bringing pastries to social events I’ve attended for the last month. And while I don’t indulge more than one pastry in a day, it probably averages to 3 in a week, which I think even that much is catching up to me. 

i’ve still been able to maintain my activity levels that I was doing previously, and I am tracking my calories that I consume outside of the bakery, but I’m finding it really difficult to get an accurate estimate on the calorie count of the bakery items that I do eat.

Now?
Now it feels like I spend half my time trying to figure out which random AI tool someone in marketing connected to our Google account. Or cleaning up leftover access from some SaaS app a former intern signed up for three quarters ago. Or discovering a “shadow” dashboard that somehow has API access to production data.

It’s like a full-time game of digital whack-a-mole.
And I didn’t sign up to be a custodian for cloud garbage.

We locked down endpoints, restricted installs, removed local admin rights — all to make things more secure. And SaaS just laughed and walked right through the front door with a browser tab and an OAuth token.

I was having coffee this morning and I just started thinking about my traumas and specifically, a moment I vividly remember when I was 9. My father struggled with alcoholism, but it became a huge issue that took over my life for a few years when he received a DUI one night when I 9 years old. Long story short, the night he drove drunk and was charged with a dui was extremely traumatic and I remember everything, but what sticks with me is how I reacted after the fact, which I still think about with feelings of shame. 

I would follow my father around to make sure he wouldn’t drink, like if he would step out of the house or go to the backyard, I would follow him and remind him that he couldn’t drink because of what happened. I did this because I was an extremely anxious child and felt it was my responsibility to make sure he didn’t do it again. I would obsess over this, and if we went to parties, I was always afraid that he would relapse or something. Maybe I feel shame because sometimes when I would do it and remind my dad not to drink, he would laugh. I would feel like an idiot for caring so much. Anyone relate to this?

1m2e0lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1m2e0lg/delve_into_the_best_manual_food_processor/,Delve Into the Best Manual Food Processor Pampered Chef Offers,"Pampered Chef Manual Food Processor 2581 has been a surprisingly handy addition to my kitchen toolkit. Known for its simplicity and versatility, I decided to give it a whirl after hearing so much about its efficiency for quick chopping needs. It's a simple, manual solution that caters to both home cooks looking for convenience and those who want a compact alternative to bulky electric food processors. Let’s dive into how this little gadget worked for me.

**Compact and Lightweight Design**

The first thing that stood out to me was its compact size and lightweight build. Measuring 8 x 6 x 8 inches and weighing just 1.9 pounds, it’s effortless to handle and store in even the smallest kitchens. For someone like me, who’s always running out of counter space (thanks to a coffee maker, toaster, and other gadgets lying around), this fits perfectly. The white color gives it a clean, minimalist aesthetic that blends seamlessly with different kitchen styles. 

**Ease of Use and Assembly**

As someone who gets easily frustrated with overly complex appliances, I found the manual design to be refreshingly straightforward. There are no cords, no batteries, and the included components— a chopping blade, container, and lid— work seamlessly together. Putting it together was a breeze, and there’s no guessing involved. A quick hand wash, as recommended in its care instructions, and it was ready to use again. 

**Upsides**

- Extremely compact, perfect for tight kitchen spaces.
- Easy assembly and disassembly for cleaning.
- Doesn’t rely on electricity—great for off-the-grid moments!
- Handy for small tasks like chopping onions, herbs, or nuts quickly.

**Performance and Efficiency**

I tested the processor with various tasks, from chopping onions to finely slicing vegetables for salads, and it did not disappoint. The manual operation gives a surprisingly good level of control over how coarse or fine you want your ingredients. A few quick pulls if you want chunky veggies and a few more for finer results. The sharp chopping blade delivers consistent results, which honestly surprised me. While it's perfect for smaller tasks, I wouldn't recommend using it for larger, tougher ingredients like hard cheeses or dense root vegetables, as it takes considerable effort.

Check [Pampered Chef Manual Food Processor 2581 price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b00qdix8rk/)

**Durability and Build**

The container and lid feel sturdy for a manual device. Over the few weeks of using it daily, I didn’t notice any wear or reduced efficiency. Some cheaper manual processors I’ve tried in the past had blades that dulled quickly, but this one seems to hold up well. The blades and components feel high-quality and built to last with proper care.

**Drawbacks**

- Small container limits the amount you can process at once.
- Hand-washing only may not appeal to dishwashing fans.
- Strains with harder ingredients, so its range is limited.

**Alternative Products**

Comparing this to electric food processors, such as the Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus, there’s no competition in terms of speed and power. However, if you’re looking for quiet operation, easy portability, and zero dependence on an outlet, the manual angle makes this processor stand out. Versus similar compact manual models like the Chef’n VeggiChop, I’d say the Pampered Chef manual food processor offers sturdier blades but lacks the versatility of chopping larger quantities that some of its contemporaries provide.

**Worth Every Penny**

While this isn’t a replacement for heavy-duty processors or blenders, it absolutely earns its keep for smaller chopping jobs. Its manual operation may put some off, but I think it adds a level of control that electric processors sometimes lack. Given the convenience, ease of use, and how well it performs its intended tasks, its value-for-money factor is hard to argue. For a fraction of what other high-end processors cost, you're getting a reliable tool that handles quick prep tasks like a champ.

Ever feel like you’re just watching your hard-earned cash vanish into thin air? 😱 You’re not alone! Whether it's subscriptions piling up or money spent on services that don’t quite deliver, there's got to be a better way. How about stepping into the world of AI and turning that money pit into a money-making machine? 🚀💸

Here are **3 actionable AI monetization ideas** you can dive into **THIS week**! Seriously, no waiting for next month’s budget. Let's make it happen!

1. **AI Content Creation**  
   - Think about how much time you spend drafting emails, writing blog posts, or even creating social media content. Now, imagine handing that over to an AI tool!  
   - Use platforms like ChatGPT or Jasper (formerly Jarvis) to generate quality content. You can charge clients for writing services, or even start a side hustle where you provide content at a fraction of the time.
   - Bonus: You can automate updates or drafts, giving you more time to focus on growing your biz instead of grinding away at the keyboard. How’s that for working smarter?

2. **Create Chatbots for Businesses**  
   - Small businesses are looking for ways to enhance customer interaction without breaking the bank. And here you come, superhero with chatbot powers! 🦸‍♀️  
   - Tools like ManyChat or Chatfuel make it super easy to craft a customized chatbot. You can charge a one-off fee or a monthly retainer to manage it.
   - Imagine sipping coffee while your chatbot handles inquiries… bliss, right? Plus, businesses love you for saving them time and improving customer service!

3. **AI-Powered Affiliate Marketing**  
   - Affiliate marketing isn’t new, but adding AI into the mix? Game changer! Use AI tools to analyze trending products that align with your niche.  
   - Sites like Ahrefs can help identify what’s hot and what’s not. Create content around these products, incorporate your affiliate links, and watch your commissions grow.
   - Why not let AI crunch the numbers while you focus on creating engaging content? More time, less hassle, and (spoiler alert!) more cash in your pocket!

Alright, hear me out—how awesome would it be to start one of these ideas while you sip on your morning coffee? ☕️ You can turn that idle time into something productive and potentially profitable. After all, who doesn’t want a little extra cash flow, am I right?

Ready to kick-start this week with some AI magic? I’m super curious to hear if any of you have tried something similar or if you have other AI monetization ideas brewing. Let’s chat! 💬",1,1752773781.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

It paid too well — which should’ve been my first warning — but I was broke, restless, and desperately in need of something that wasn’t platinum trophy hunting or doomscrolling my life away.

The ad read:

Seemed perfect. Emphasis on seemed.

It took less than twenty minutes into my first shift for my perception of reality to… warp. That’s the word for it. Twisted, smeared, and bent into something I still don’t fully understand.

No one outside this place would believe me — and frankly, I wouldn’t blame them. But I have to get this out. There’s something wrong with Cineplex 24. Something wrong in ways the human brain isn’t designed to name.

And I fear this job might not just last a lifetime. It might be the thing that takes it.

After finishing college, my life had become a revolving door of Red Bulls, pot noodles, and the cold blue glow of my TV screen. My serotonin was rationed between trophy pings and TikToks. I was bored and numb. The kind of numb that gets mistaken for peace.

Then the ad hit my screen.

It autoplayed, a low-quality YouTube pre-roll. A man in a sharp red suit — like something from a cheap Vegas lounge — pointed directly at me, eyes wild behind a too-big grin.

“YOU. YES, YOU. Jobs are scarce in this little nugget of a world, but do I have an EXCITING OPPORTUNITY for you! Cineplex 24 is hiring NOW! Great pay, great perks, all the popcorn you can stomach! So what are you waiting for? Click the link below, or come down and ask for me, Mr. Clinton!”

Then he dove into a vat of popcorn, surfaced grinning with kernels spilling from his mouth, and gave a thumbs up as the Cineplex 24 logo spun into frame.

I was at the cinema twenty minutes later.

Cineplex 24 is beautiful — too beautiful. Like a caricature of a cinema drawn from childhood nostalgia.

Big glass doors, red neon signage, pristine white light board with black film titles, vintage posters stretching down the side walls. It reminded me a bit of the New Beverly Cinema in LA, where we stopped during a college trip to California. A place that feels curated to be comforting. Too pristine. Too clean. Like it was built from a memory.

I folded my CV (badly) into my back pocket and walked through the glass doors.

Inside: a red carpet lobby with golden detailing. Marble staircases sweeping to either side. In the centre, a glowing concession island with glass cases full of overpriced sugar. Little themed buckets. Limited edition cups.

And behind it, a man elbow-deep in the guts of a slush machine.

“Hey, buddy,” I said. “I’m here about the job? Mr. Clinton around?”

The man jerked, startled. His head popped out of the machine — curly brown hair, thick black-rimmed glasses, and a moustache that looked like it was drawn on in biro.

He squinted at me. “Mate, I’ve told you. Your friend’s not here. Stop saying he was killed. We both know there was no evidence, no body, and—”

He paused.

“Wait. You’re not the bloke looking for Rob, are you?”

I blinked. “Uh… no. I’m asking about the job.”

He muttered something under his breath — I caught the words “stupid Nick, not supposed to mention the death” — then slapped his own forehead with a pathetic little whap.

“Oh. Right. Mr. Clinton? He’s in the office. Over there, by the stairs.”

And with that, he returned to the slush machine and began to sob into it.

I didn’t ask. I just walked away.
The office door was already ajar.

“YES! Yes, come in!” boomed a voice before I’d even knocked.

Inside was the man from the advert, though… off somehow. He looked like someone had tried to recreate Danny DeVito from memory. His nose looked freshly broken. He now had an extravagant, curled moustache. No glasses. Too many teeth.

He waved me in, gesturing to a chair with exaggerated flair.

“Ahhh, there you are! Sit, sit! You’re here for the job, yes? The night shift?”

“Yes, Mr. Clinton. I—”

I pulled out my CV, but he snatched it mid-sentence, skimmed it for half a second, then crumpled it into a ball and hooked it into the bin like a basketball pro.

“No need for that nonsense,” he grinned. “I want to know you. Not what some paper says about you.”

He gripped my shoulders. Firm. Too firm.

“Now then. Tell me — favourite film. Has to be before you were born.”

“Uh… Reservoir Dogs?”

He leaned in. Inches from my face. I could smell popcorn and something coppery.

“I bloody love a bit of Tarantino,” he whispered, eyes wide with a little glint of madness.

He stepped back and rifled through a drawer, pulling out a thick file.

“So, Will — do you like the place?”

My name isn’t Will. Never has been.

But I said, “Yeah, it’s great. I love the—”

“SMASHING, Will! You’re hired!”

He handed me the file.

“You start tomorrow. Eleven sharp. Use the back door. Never the front after 11pm. Ash, our other night employee, will let you in.”

He ushered me toward the exit, clapping me on the back.

“Oh, and if that deranged man is outside again, do not — and I mean do not — speak to him. He’s… lost. And the police are sniffing around about some Robert fellow again, so I need to make a few calls…”

The door slammed behind me with a loud CLACK. Then came the bolt. Then the chain. A series of locks. Too many locks.

I stood in the lobby with the file in my hands, trying to process what the hell had just happened.
The file seemed standard at first — health and safety sheets, emergency contacts, all the usual corporate nonsense.

But near the back, nestled between photocopied training sheets, was a single white page in bright red ink:

FOR NIGHT WORKER EYES ONLY

The first page looked handwritten. Sloppy. Panicked.


To the poor unfortunate soul who’s got the pleasure of working with me…
Welcome.
The job isn’t what you think, so here are some rules you’d do well to follow if you want to keep your bones inside your skin.



Then came the list. Typed exactly as written:




Screen 14 doesn’t exist. If anyone asks for it, take their money. They’ll find their way.
At 2:57am, a man in a green coat will appear in the lobby. Don’t acknowledge him. Leave a small popcorn on the counter. He’ll leave at 3:00.
Lobby speakers don’t work. If you hear static, turn off all lights and hide beneath the concession cabinets. Stay quiet. This usually lasts 90 seconds. Usually.
If you hear someone calling from Screen 2 between 12–1am, ignore it. No matter the voice. Do. Not. Enter.
If a customer asks for a film that doesn’t exist, issue them a ticket to Screen 5. Do not engage in conversation.
The emergency exit upstairs isn’t real. Never open it.
If you see yourself walk through the lobby doors, run out the back. Immediately. Your co-worker will know what to do.




That’s all I have for now. Sadly, that’s not all there is.
Stick to the rules. Keep your head. And maybe, just maybe, you’ll survive long enough to regret it.

Good luck.
—Ash



I laughed. Genuinely laughed.

I figured it was just hazing. A spooky little initiation to mess with the new guy. I was actually looking forward to meeting Ash. They clearly had a sick sense of humour.

But even then — buried somewhere beneath the disbelief and sarcasm — was a quiet, flickering instinct.

I should take this seriously.


I turned up for my first shift at 10:58pm, standing in the pissing rain behind the back entrance of Cineplex 24, holding the folder like it was going to protect me from the cold — or the creeping sense that I’d made a terrible mistake.

I almost left. I really did.

Then the steel door swung open.

A figure stood there in the uniform: red trousers, waistcoat, crisp white shirt. Not what I expected. Definitely not unpleasant.

Short, thick black hair streaked with blue. Tattoo sleeves that spiralled with chaotic stories — snakes, pocket watches, fragments of eyes and flames. Piercings glinting beneath the flickering back-alley light.

“You’re the new guy,” they said, stepping aside. “Come in.”

Their voice was low and half-asleep, the kind that’s spent years staying up too late. I was ushered into a tiny concrete room barely wider than a hallway. Ash — that had to be them — pointed to an old metal scanner beside the wall.

I pulled out my ticket:

Admit One – Cineplex 24
Film: NIGHT SHIFT
Starring: [My Name]

Slid it through.

A mechanical ka-chunk sounded from somewhere behind the wall. I wasn’t sure if that was the scanner or something… 
Ash gave me the world’s most apathetic tour.

They explained the tills. The break room. The broom cupboard that “might be bigger inside depending on the time.” The popcorn machine had a dent in it — apparently from someone trying to attack it when it “started crawling.”

Everything was accompanied by a shrug or a “meh.” Like they were describing a particularly disappointing Tesco shift, not a place with seven paranormal workplace safety rules.

We were halfway through counting change when the lobby speakers behind us clicked.

Not the usual soft click. This was sharp, unnatural — like someone slapping two bits of bone together.

Ash froze.

“Oh f— not now,” they whispered.

I laughed. “What, is this the part where you try and scare the new guy?”

I didn’t finish the sentence.

Ash shoved me to the floor, killed the lobby lights with one swift flick, and dragged me under the concession stand.

I opened my mouth again, but Ash slapped a hand over it.

“Shh,” they hissed.

And then it began.
The speakers didn’t play music. Not exactly. It was like someone had tried to reconstruct a lullaby from broken instruments. Warped piano. Screaming violin. A trumpet gasping its final breath.

Then came the THUDS.

Heavy. Rhythmic. Dull, wet, and impossibly close.

The sound of something that shouldn’t have legs but does. Something that puts its whole body into every step. Floorboards cracked. Glass rattled. I could feel it — not just hear it.

Then… sniffing.

Not a person. Not even a dog. This was something feral and broken, dragging long, rattling sniffs across the air like it was trying to peel my scent off my skin.

Then the groan.

I wish I could explain it properly. Imagine a wolf howling underwater while someone shoves a straw into its lungs and stirs. That kind of sound. Half-voice, half-choke.

I was shaking. Not metaphorically. My teeth clicked. I held my breath so hard my chest burned. I didn’t know whether to scream or cry, so I did neither.

The thuds moved on. Eventually.

The speakers fell silent.

Ash stood, dusted themselves off, and nudged me with a boot.

“Up you get. It’s gone.”

I scrambled upright.

“What the fuck was that?” I gasped. “That was… that wasn’t real, right? That wasn’t—”

Ash, somehow already back to casual, shrugged. “That’s the Beast. It’s the only one that’s really dangerous, far as I know that comes out of there, I mean the grey lady keeps fucking with my displays … bitch ”

They moved back to the till like they hadn’t just faced the embodiment of fear.

“Thing crawls out of Screen 10 most nights. We close it at nine, but the movie still plays. Nobody knows what film. No one asks.”

I was hyperventilating. I sat next to the popcorn machine and just… broke a little. My limbs stopped listening to me. I stared at the floor and tried not to throw up.

Ash tossed me a handful of popcorn and squatted down beside me, sipping a Monster from a cracked can.

“Happens to everyone on shift one,” they said, mouth full. “Congrats. You survived.”
Once I stopped shaking, I asked Ash what would’ve happened if I hadn’t followed the rule.

“What if I’d turned on the lights? Or… or ran? Or looked at it?”

Ash scrolled through their phone and said nothing.

Then they turned the screen to me.

I immediately vomited in the bin.

It took me a moment to understand what I was looking at.

It was a person — or it had been. Wearing the Cineplex uniform. But their body had collapsed like someone removed every bone and cartilage and filled them with soup. The arms were just meat sacks. The head was a sagging balloon. A big wet meat pile.

Ash spoke softly. “That was Rob. Didn’t take the rules seriously.”

I wiped my mouth.

“Why the hell do you have that on your phone?”

Ash shrugged. “Morbid curiosity. Also proof. Helps newbies believe me when I say this place is not fucking around.”
After that, everything felt… still.

Like we were in the eye of a storm.

Customers came and went. Some were normal. Some were clearly not. 
By 2:55am, I was beginning to relax.

By 2:57am, I wanted to climb inside the popcorn machine and die.

The lobby temperature dropped five degrees in an instant. The air turned syrup-thick. My spine began to tingle before I even saw him.

A man in a green coat stepped through the front doors.

He didn’t walk. He… slid.

Like the world was moving around him.

He glided to the centre of the lobby and stood still. Head down. Hands loose at his sides. Ash had written not to look directly, but I couldn’t help it — just a little peek from the corner of my eye.

His shoes made a shrill squeak as he drifted forward.

I grabbed a small popcorn from the warmer, placed it on the counter, and left it there. Then I stepped back, heart pounding so hard it felt like it was trying to burst out of my throat.

He arrived at the glass counter. Slowly. No footsteps. Just the sound of friction.

And then he whispered.

His voice wasn’t loud. But it didn’t need to be.

It sounded like a violin string being dragged across barbed wire.

“Number 97. Blue curtains. White door with glass panel. Broken fence. Little dog. Soon.”



To anyone else this would just be random words but he was describing my house.
Down to the cracked panel in the garden gate.

The man picked up the popcorn. And disappeared. Not walked out. Not faded. Just — gone.

I stood there sweating, staring at the empty spot where he’d been, and finally managed to move.

I ran. Straight to the staff room.
Ash was on the staff room sofa, feet up, watching TikTok.

“Let me guess,” they said, eyes still on the screen. “Green coat?”

“How the hell did it know where I live?” I shouted.

Ash smiled.

“Yeah, it likes to test the newbies. Get under your skin. If you talk to it, though — or look at it full-on — you’re done. So, hey. Congrats. You passed.”

“Passed?”

“What would’ve happened if I didn’t?” I asked, voice shaking.

Ash tossed their feet to the floor, then pulled up another photo. Another meat puddle. Another face barely recognisable almost as if they’d been stepped on by an elephant.

“Blob man,” they said, deadpan. “The sequel.”
I asked Ash how they were so unfazed by all of this. How they hadn’t gone completely mad.

Ash cracked their knuckles. Their eyes went dark for a moment. Sad.

“My dad’s Mr. Clinton. And the cinema… it’s kind of a family business. After his partner died I … well stepped in to help”

I opened my mouth to ask more, but Ash shook their head.

“I don’t wanna talk about it. You’re doing fine. Go take your break. Seriously — take a couple of hours.”

I didn’t argue. I needed to breathe. Or sleep. Or die.

I walked to the table in the corner.

Sat in the chair laying my head on the table.

And the world… shifted.

The break room wasn’t where I’d left it.

When I closed my eyes, I was sitting in a freezing little staff lounge with cracked leather sofas and a vending machine that only dispensed Root Beer or static.

When I opened them again, I was in a café.

Not just a café — an eerie copy of a café I knew all to well . The one my grandparents used to take me to on Sunday mornings. Pepper’s Café, I think it was called. Torn from the 70s. Cream walls, wooden booths, red checkerboard tablecloths, the smell of warm butter and burnt bacon.

Behind the counter stood a man in a paper hat and apron, humming as he polished a ceramic mug.

He noticed me, beamed, and said: “Morning, bud! Fancy a nice hot cup of Joe to perk you up?”

“Erm… yeah. Thank you. That’s very kind.”

He poured me a cup, steam curling up into the fluorescent lights above. I took a sip — and I swear to god, it was the best cup of coffee I’ve ever had. Rich. Dark. A little sweet. Like the smell of safety.

“What is this place?” I asked, looking around.

The man — short, balding, deeply kind eyes — did a small spin and flung his arms wide.

“This, my boy, is George’s Café!”

I blinked. “And… you’re George?”

“Damn right I am!”

He sat down across from me, folded his hands, and smiled like a granddad about to explain where babies come from.

“Now listen. I know what’s out there. All of it. This place — it’s a pocket. A little corner of the Cineplex carved out by a man named Alphonse.”

“Alphonse?”

George nodded.

“gone now... But before that — before it all went too far — he made this place. A safe space. For the staff , curated to their own feeling of safety”
I felt a weight pressing against my chest. The kind that tells you this peace is only temporary.

I stood, thanked him quietly, and walked toward the exit I hadn’t seen before — now a frosted glass door marked “LOBBY.”

Before I opened it, George said softly:

“Be careful, lad.”

Ash was standing in the lobby, staring through the glass front doors as sunlight began to leak across the car park.

“Beautiful, isn’t it?” they said.

“What is?”

“How a place full of monsters can still make something this golden.”

The light hit their face in such a way that, for a moment, I saw just how tired they were.

“Ash,” I started. “I don’t think I can keep doing this.”

They turned sharply. Grabbed my shoulders.

“Don’t say that,” they whispered. “Not even out loud.”

“What? Why not? I’ve seen things that shouldn’t exist. I’ve had my house described by something with no face.”
Ash shook their head violently. “You don’t get it. You can’t say you want to leave. If it hears you — it’ll take that as rejection.”Ash’s eyes darkened. Their grip tightened.

“I don’t know what it is. No one does. But I’ve seen what happens when someone quits. It doesn’t let them go. Not cleanly. Not fully. You’re tied to this place now. Only two ways out: permission… or death.”

“Permission from what?”

Silence.

Ash looked away.

“Take your pay. Rest. Come back tomorrow.”
I slumped against the wall, numb and shaking.

Ash, trying to lighten the mood, laughed a little.

“Hey — at least the pay’s good, right?”

I snorted. “£18 an hour to get psychologically shredded? Yeah, a bargain.”

Ash blinked. “£18?”

“Yeah… the job ad—”

“No, no, no. You’re not getting £18.” Ash looked genuinely confused.

“You’re on the night rate. You get £180 an hour.”

I just stared at them.

“Wait, what?”

“Yeah. That’s why most of the others stay , or , stayed.” 
I was in utter shock and disbelief, maybe I could stick it out for the immense amount of money on the line. 
6:00am hit. The staff scanner beeped me out.

The morning shift passed us in the hallway as I left. They looked clean. Normal. Confused as to why I was pale and twitching and covered in popcorn.

Ash climbed the steps above the lobby to the flat above the cinema.

They shouted down to me:

“Hey! You survived day one! Better than the last few.”

Then they shut the door behind them.
I slept 12 hours that day. Didn’t dream. Or maybe I did and just don’t remember.

The next two nights? Oddly… uneventful.

Nothing violent. Just weird.

The popcorn machine got up and walked away. Came back 20 minutes later like nothing happened.
The film posters all changed overnight to advertise a movie called The Hunter’s Beartrap. No one’s heard of it. But every customer who bought a ticket for it seemed… satisfied. I think they were customers. I think they were people.


I don’t feel the same fear I did that first night. It’s like my nervous system gave up trying.

But the rules still hold. The dread still bubbles. And the money is still flooding in.

And that’s the scariest part.

Because I don’t think I want to leave anymore. I can’t. But to anyone reading this please take it as a warning not to answer the ad , I’m on too deep now. I’ll try to keep you all updated when I can but for now , I’m signing off.

“Now then. Tell me — favourite film. Has to be before you were born.”

“Uh… Reservoir Dogs?”

He leaned in. Inches from my face. I could smell popcorn and something coppery.

“I bloody love a bit of Tarantino,” he whispered, eyes wide with a little glint of madness.

He stepped back and rifled through a drawer, pulling out a thick file.

“So, Will — do you like the place?”

My name isn’t Will. Never has been.

But I said, “Yeah, it’s great. I love the—”

“SMASHING, Will! You’re hired!”

He handed me the file.

“You start tomorrow. Eleven sharp. Use the back door. Never the front after 11pm. Ash, our other night employee, will let you in.”

He ushered me toward the exit, clapping me on the back.

“Oh, and if that deranged man is outside again, do not — and I mean do not — speak to him. He’s… lost. And the police are sniffing around about some Robert fellow again, so I need to make a few calls…”

The door slammed behind me with a loud CLACK. Then came the bolt. Then the chain. A series of locks. Too many locks.

I stood in the lobby with the file in my hands, trying to process what the hell had just happened.
The file seemed standard at first — health and safety sheets, emergency contacts, all the usual corporate nonsense.

But near the back, nestled between photocopied training sheets, was a single white page in bright red ink:

FOR NIGHT WORKER EYES ONLY

The first page looked handwritten. Sloppy. Panicked.


To the poor unfortunate soul who’s got the pleasure of working with me…
Welcome.
The job isn’t what you think, so here are some rules you’d do well to follow if you want to keep your bones inside your skin.



Then came the list. Typed exactly as written:




Screen 14 doesn’t exist. If anyone asks for it, take their money. They’ll find their way.
At 2:57am, a man in a green coat will appear in the lobby. Don’t acknowledge him. Leave a small popcorn on the counter. He’ll leave at 3:00.
Lobby speakers don’t work. If you hear static, turn off all lights and hide beneath the concession cabinets. Stay quiet. This usually lasts 90 seconds. Usually.
If you hear someone calling from Screen 2 between 12–1am, ignore it. No matter the voice. Do. Not. Enter.
If a customer asks for a film that doesn’t exist, issue them a ticket to Screen 5. Do not engage in conversation.
The emergency exit upstairs isn’t real. Never open it.
If you see yourself walk through the lobby doors, run out the back. Immediately. Your co-worker will know what to do.




That’s all I have for now. Sadly, that’s not all there is.
Stick to the rules. Keep your head. And maybe, just maybe, you’ll survive long enough to regret it.

Good luck.
—Ash



I laughed. Genuinely laughed.

I figured it was just hazing. A spooky little initiation to mess with the new guy. I was actually looking forward to meeting Ash. They clearly had a sick sense of humour.

But even then — buried somewhere beneath the disbelief and sarcasm — was a quiet, flickering instinct.

I should take this seriously.


I turned up for my first shift at 10:58pm, standing in the pissing rain behind the back entrance of Cineplex 24, holding the folder like it was going to protect me from the cold — or the creeping sense that I’d made a terrible mistake.

I almost left. I really did.

Then the steel door swung open.

A figure stood there in the uniform: red trousers, waistcoat, crisp white shirt. Not what I expected. Definitely not unpleasant.

Short, thick black hair streaked with blue. Tattoo sleeves that spiralled with chaotic stories — snakes, pocket watches, fragments of eyes and flames. Piercings glinting beneath the flickering back-alley light.

“You’re the new guy,” they said, stepping aside. “Come in.”

Their voice was low and half-asleep, the kind that’s spent years staying up too late. I was ushered into a tiny concrete room barely wider than a hallway. Ash — that had to be them — pointed to an old metal scanner beside the wall.

I pulled out my ticket:

Admit One – Cineplex 24
Film: NIGHT SHIFT
Starring: [My Name]

Slid it through.

A mechanical ka-chunk sounded from somewhere behind the wall. I wasn’t sure if that was the scanner or something… 
Ash gave me the world’s most apathetic tour.

They explained the tills. The break room. The broom cupboard that “might be bigger inside depending on the time.” The popcorn machine had a dent in it — apparently from someone trying to attack it when it “started crawling.”

Everything was accompanied by a shrug or a “meh.” Like they were describing a particularly disappointing Tesco shift, not a place with seven paranormal workplace safety rules.

We were halfway through counting change when the lobby speakers behind us clicked.

Not the usual soft click. This was sharp, unnatural — like someone slapping two bits of bone together.

Ash froze.

“Oh f— not now,” they whispered.

I laughed. “What, is this the part where you try and scare the new guy?”

I didn’t finish the sentence.

Ash shoved me to the floor, killed the lobby lights with one swift flick, and dragged me under the concession stand.

I opened my mouth again, but Ash slapped a hand over it.

“Shh,” they hissed.

And then it began.
The speakers didn’t play music. Not exactly. It was like someone had tried to reconstruct a lullaby from broken instruments. Warped piano. Screaming violin. A trumpet gasping its final breath.

Then came the THUDS.

Heavy. Rhythmic. Dull, wet, and impossibly close.

The sound of something that shouldn’t have legs but does. Something that puts its whole body into every step. Floorboards cracked. Glass rattled. I could feel it — not just hear it.

Then… sniffing.

Not a person. Not even a dog. This was something feral and broken, dragging long, rattling sniffs across the air like it was trying to peel my scent off my skin.

Then the groan.

I wish I could explain it properly. Imagine a wolf howling underwater while someone shoves a straw into its lungs and stirs. That kind of sound. Half-voice, half-choke.

I was shaking. Not metaphorically. My teeth clicked. I held my breath so hard my chest burned. I didn’t know whether to scream or cry, so I did neither.

The thuds moved on. Eventually.

The speakers fell silent.

Ash stood, dusted themselves off, and nudged me with a boot.

“Up you get. It’s gone.”

I scrambled upright.

“What the fuck was that?” I gasped. “That was… that wasn’t real, right? That wasn’t—”

Ash, somehow already back to casual, shrugged. “That’s the Beast. It’s the only one that’s really dangerous, far as I know that comes out of there, I mean the grey lady keeps fucking with my displays … bitch ”

They moved back to the till like they hadn’t just faced the embodiment of fear.

“Thing crawls out of Screen 10 most nights. We close it at nine, but the movie still plays. Nobody knows what film. No one asks.”

I was hyperventilating. I sat next to the popcorn machine and just… broke a little. My limbs stopped listening to me. I stared at the floor and tried not to throw up.

Ash tossed me a handful of popcorn and squatted down beside me, sipping a Monster from a cracked can.

“Happens to everyone on shift one,” they said, mouth full. “Congrats. You survived.”
Once I stopped shaking, I asked Ash what would’ve happened if I hadn’t followed the rule.

“What if I’d turned on the lights? Or… or ran? Or looked at it?”

Ash scrolled through their phone and said nothing.

Then they turned the screen to me.

I immediately vomited in the bin.

It took me a moment to understand what I was looking at.

It was a person — or it had been. Wearing the Cineplex uniform. But their body had collapsed like someone removed every bone and cartilage and filled them with soup. The arms were just meat sacks. The head was a sagging balloon. A big wet meat pile.

Ash spoke softly. “That was Rob. Didn’t take the rules seriously.”

I wiped my mouth.

“Why the hell do you have that on your phone?”

Ash shrugged. “Morbid curiosity. Also proof. Helps newbies believe me when I say this place is not fucking around.”
After that, everything felt… still.

Like we were in the eye of a storm.

Customers came and went. Some were normal. Some were clearly not. 
By 2:55am, I was beginning to relax.

By 2:57am, I wanted to climb inside the popcorn machine and die.

The lobby temperature dropped five degrees in an instant. The air turned syrup-thick. My spine began to tingle before I even saw him.

A man in a green coat stepped through the front doors.

He didn’t walk. He… slid.

Like the world was moving around him.

He glided to the centre of the lobby and stood still. Head down. Hands loose at his sides. Ash had written not to look directly, but I couldn’t help it — just a little peek from the corner of my eye.

His shoes made a shrill squeak as he drifted forward.

I grabbed a small popcorn from the warmer, placed it on the counter, and left it there. Then I stepped back, heart pounding so hard it felt like it was trying to burst out of my throat.

He arrived at the glass counter. Slowly. No footsteps. Just the sound of friction.

And then he whispered.

His voice wasn’t loud. But it didn’t need to be.

It sounded like a violin string being dragged across barbed wire.

“Number 97. Blue curtains. White door with glass panel. Broken fence. Little dog. Soon.”



To anyone else this would just be random words but he was describing my house.
Down to the cracked panel in the garden gate.

The man picked up the popcorn. And disappeared. Not walked out. Not faded. Just — gone.

I stood there sweating, staring at the empty spot where he’d been, and finally managed to move.

I ran. Straight to the staff room.
Ash was on the staff room sofa, feet up, watching TikTok.

“Let me guess,” they said, eyes still on the screen. “Green coat?”

“How the hell did it know where I live?” I shouted.

Ash smiled.

“Yeah, it likes to test the newbies. Get under your skin. If you talk to it, though — or look at it full-on — you’re done. So, hey. Congrats. You passed.”

“Passed?”

“What would’ve happened if I didn’t?” I asked, voice shaking.

Ash tossed their feet to the floor, then pulled up another photo. Another meat puddle. Another face barely recognisable almost as if they’d been stepped on by an elephant.

“Blob man,” they said, deadpan. “The sequel.”
I asked Ash how they were so unfazed by all of this. How they hadn’t gone completely mad.

Ash cracked their knuckles. Their eyes went dark for a moment. Sad.

“My dad’s Mr. Clinton. And the cinema… it’s kind of a family business. After his partner died I … well stepped in to help”

I opened my mouth to ask more, but Ash shook their head.

“I don’t wanna talk about it. You’re doing fine. Go take your break. Seriously — take a couple of hours.”

I didn’t argue. I needed to breathe. Or sleep. Or die.

I walked to the table in the corner.

Sat in the chair laying my head on the table.

And the world… shifted.

The break room wasn’t where I’d left it.

When I closed my eyes, I was sitting in a freezing little staff lounge with cracked leather sofas and a vending machine that only dispensed Root Beer or static.

When I opened them again, I was in a café.

Not just a café — an eerie copy of a café I knew all to well . The one my grandparents used to take me to on Sunday mornings. Pepper’s Café, I think it was called. Torn from the 70s. Cream walls, wooden booths, red checkerboard tablecloths, the smell of warm butter and burnt bacon.

Behind the counter stood a man in a paper hat and apron, humming as he polished a ceramic mug.

He noticed me, beamed, and said: “Morning, bud! Fancy a nice hot cup of Joe to perk you up?”

“Erm… yeah. Thank you. That’s very kind.”

He poured me a cup, steam curling up into the fluorescent lights above. I took a sip — and I swear to god, it was the best cup of coffee I’ve ever had. Rich. Dark. A little sweet. Like the smell of safety.

“What is this place?” I asked, looking around.

The man — short, balding, deeply kind eyes — did a small spin and flung his arms wide.

“This, my boy, is George’s Café!”

I blinked. “And… you’re George?”

“Damn right I am!”

He sat down across from me, folded his hands, and smiled like a granddad about to explain where babies come from.

“Now listen. I know what’s out there. All of it. This place — it’s a pocket. A little corner of the Cineplex carved out by a man named Alphonse.”

“Alphonse?”

George nodded.

“gone now... But before that — before it all went too far — he made this place. A safe space. For the staff , curated to their own feeling of safety”
I felt a weight pressing against my chest. The kind that tells you this peace is only temporary.

I stood, thanked him quietly, and walked toward the exit I hadn’t seen before — now a frosted glass door marked “LOBBY.”

Before I opened it, George said softly:

“Be careful, lad.”

Ash was standing in the lobby, staring through the glass front doors as sunlight began to leak across the car park.

“Beautiful, isn’t it?” they said.

“What is?”

“How a place full of monsters can still make something this golden.”

The light hit their face in such a way that, for a moment, I saw just how tired they were.

“Ash,” I started. “I don’t think I can keep doing this.”

They turned sharply. Grabbed my shoulders.

“Don’t say that,” they whispered. “Not even out loud.”

“What? Why not? I’ve seen things that shouldn’t exist. I’ve had my house described by something with no face.”
Ash shook their head violently. “You don’t get it. You can’t say you want to leave. If it hears you — it’ll take that as rejection.”Ash’s eyes darkened. Their grip tightened.

“I don’t know what it is. No one does. But I’ve seen what happens when someone quits. It doesn’t let them go. Not cleanly. Not fully. You’re tied to this place now. Only two ways out: permission… or death.”

“Permission from what?”

Silence.

Ash looked away.

“Take your pay. Rest. Come back tomorrow.”
I slumped against the wall, numb and shaking.

Ash, trying to lighten the mood, laughed a little.

“Hey — at least the pay’s good, right?”

I snorted. “£18 an hour to get psychologically shredded? Yeah, a bargain.”

Ash blinked. “£18?”

“Yeah… the job ad—”

“No, no, no. You’re not getting £18.” Ash looked genuinely confused.

“You’re on the night rate. You get £180 an hour.”

I just stared at them.

“Wait, what?”

“Yeah. That’s why most of the others stay , or , stayed.” 
I was in utter shock and disbelief, maybe I could stick it out for the immense amount of money on the line. 
6:00am hit. The staff scanner beeped me out.

The morning shift passed us in the hallway as I left. They looked clean. Normal. Confused as to why I was pale and twitching and covered in popcorn.

Ash climbed the steps above the lobby to the flat above the cinema.

They shouted down to me:

“Hey! You survived day one! Better than the last few.”

Then they shut the door behind them.
I slept 12 hours that day. Didn’t dream. Or maybe I did and just don’t remember.

The next two nights? Oddly… uneventful.

Nothing violent. Just weird.

The popcorn machine got up and walked away. Came back 20 minutes later like nothing happened.
The film posters all changed overnight to advertise a movie called The Hunter’s Beartrap. No one’s heard of it. But every customer who bought a ticket for it seemed… satisfied. I think they were customers. I think they were people.


I don’t feel the same fear I did that first night. It’s like my nervous system gave up trying.

But the rules still hold. The dread still bubbles. And the money is still flooding in.

And that’s the scariest part.

Because I don’t think I want to leave anymore. I can’t. But to anyone reading this please take it as a warning not to answer the ad , I’m on too deep now. I’ll try to keep you all updated when I can but for now , I’m signing off.

1m2dqz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m2dqz2/should_you_buy_the_ninja_pb041st_singleserve/,Should You Buy the Ninja PB041ST Single-Serve Coffee Maker Review for Ultimate Convenience?,"Testing out the Ninja PB041ST Pods & Grounds Single-Serve Coffee Maker has been quite an interesting journey. This compact coffee maker, capable of brewing both coffee pods and grounds, caught my eye because of its versatility, and I was honestly looking forward to seeing if it could meet my daily caffeine requirements. Between hectic mornings and leisurely weekend afternoons, I felt like I gave this machine a thorough workout, and it certainly delivered in more ways than one.

**Superb Design and Compact Size**  
The coffee maker has a sleek, stone-colored finish, blending effortlessly with my kitchen’s aesthetic. Its dimensions—13.07""D x 5.31""W x 13.31""H—make it an unobtrusive addition to a countertop, which is critical when you don’t want appliances overtaking the space. The storage drawer for the brew basket or permanent filter is a smart touch. It keeps everything tidy, which is a plus for someone who can't stand clutter in the kitchen. While compact, I noticed that this size limitation sometimes required maneuvering the water reservoir a bit awkwardly for refilling.

**Brewing Capabilities That Deliver Variety**  
This machine offers variety, whether you’re brewing for a quick cup or filling up a travel mug. You can go from 6-oz. grounds coffee to a 24-oz. travel-mug-sized brew, or stick with pod options that accommodate sizes from 6-oz. to 12-oz. The Classic, Rich, and Over Ice brew styles really made my experimenting fun. I personally favored the Over Ice function—finally, iced coffee that doesn’t end up tasting like water. My coworkers were impressed when I brought some to the office, as it tasted like something you’d get at a café.

**[Discover Ninja PB041ST Price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0c29lznld/)**  

**Thermal Flavor Extraction Duo Technology at Its Finest**  
A major highlight is the thermal flavor extraction duo feature. With even saturation and precise temperature control, every cup was robust and flavorful. Compared to my older coffee maker, the difference in taste was evident. Some family members have noted they could tell this machine made their coffee much richer, particularly when we used the grounds option.

**Positives**   
- Dual brewing capability for coffee pods and grounds  
- Compact design suitable for small kitchens  
- Three brewing styles, including an Over Ice option  
- Versatile brew sizes ranging from 6-oz. to 24-oz.  
- Sleek, stone finish and space-efficient storage  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Water reservoir removal for refilling feels slightly cumbersome  
- The pod adapter can be tricky to clean compared to other components  

**On-the-Go Convenience for Busy Days**  
A lifesaver on rushed mornings, this machine allows you to brew directly into a 24-oz. travel mug. The permanent filter and reusable brew basket meant I didn’t have to scramble for disposable filters, which is a nice eco-friendly touch. My commute caffeine routine has undoubtedly been elevated, although I did spill once while trying to figure out the perfect mug fit under the spout.

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to other single-serve coffee makers in its league, like Keurig models or even the cheaper Black+Decker options, this product stands out for its dual brewing capabilities with pods and grounds. While Keurig thrives on convenience, the Ninja PB041ST offers a flavor extraction process that surpasses most competitors in brewing depth. However, the removable reservoir may not seem as user-friendly as the fixed ones in a few competitor machines.  

**Price Worthiness**  
It certainly seems like a worthwhile investment for its versatility and quality brewing options. While some brands offer similarly-priced products, the inclusion of both grounds and pod brewing, coupled with the robust flavor output, puts this model slightly ahead of the curve. If you’re someone who values variety and wants to streamline their coffee setup, this is a solid choice. Skipping café prices while maintaining quality is a real win for your wallet.

1m2dpgl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m2dpgl,Hyatt Regency Waikiki Beach Resort and Spa,"I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Waikiki Beach Resort and Spa for two days and one night. It was AMAZING. I used points for a free night here— it was an extension to my staycation plans after checking out of the Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach. I noticed that after checking in online, I was placed in junior suite when I originally booked a room with a king bed. A big shout out to both Grace and Trisha at the check in counter for telling me to wait for my room (I had to check out of the Hyatt Place ASAP because it was so noisy in my room)— I really wanted to get into my room at the Hyatt Regency and was willing to take anything open, but the wait was worth it for the junior suite. Grace offered me two drink vouchers while I waited for my room at one of their restaurants at the property— great customer service because the drinks were really great at ‘SWIM’ (and not to my surprise, this bar was right next to the pool, hahaha).

When I arrived in my room, the ‘Surf House’ I realized it was decked out with local vendors and artists from the North Shore (NOHO House, Moniz Family Surf, Lloyd Boards, JT Ojerio of Aloha Mele, and Kamea Hadar). The junior suite had a nice oceanfront view from the 26th floor. Despite it being a short stay, I was really able to unwind and relax with my spouse. I loved how there was a bidet toilet too!!

The Hyatt Regency conveniently has a lot of shops around it. I really recommend Kai Coffee. They have a dimsum restaurant called Kirin Restaurant, and I will definitely say, it is the best in town. I’ve been to so many dim sum restaurants in Honolulu, and nothing compares to Kirin!! I’ll have to check out ‘The Buffet’ later.

There’s also a spa that is heavily advertised. I wanted to try it out, but couldn’t justify paying almost $200+ for either a facial or massage. If anyone has gone to the spa, please chime in. 

The gym was great. There were THREE Pelotons! Of course, this being Hawaii, one of them was not working. However, my spouse and I were able to both get a workout in. All the cables and free weights that we needed were there for arm/chest day.

I definitely will stay here again for a staycation. My spouse and I are really excited to come here again for a longer stay. I’m excited to see what benefits I can get now as an Explorist at this location (this was my 30th night, so it was a great treat to move up to Explorist after checking out).

Sorry I don’t have a photo here and sorry this isn’t about the “real” stuff; I’m pretty regularly on the go so I just drink the canned stuff (which unfortunately means either a sugar blast or a Stevia letdown, but as someone who can’t really drink coffee anymore it gets the job done). I just had a question about some odd particulate I found in two separate cans (with different flavors too) of Guayaki Yerba Mate that I purchased from the same store. I had poured the first one into a foam coffee cup as I’m OCD enough to not like putting my mouth on the can, and had downed most of it (as it tasted pretty normal) when I saw some odd, rather large particles down at the bottom. I had never seen such a thing as long as I have been drinking this brand, so I was a bit alarmed. I tried to inspect what the particles were by pouring them out into a separate cup, but they dissolved back into the rest of the drink when I tried to do so. Given that I had drank most of the can, I figured I was as screwed as I was going to be at that point, so I tried to move on (but still was kinda freaking out on the inside). Later, while eating lunch, I opened a completely separate can from the first one. It looked and tasted fine once at first once again, but as I got to the bottom—oh no, there’s stuff in here again. I was able to inspect at least one of the particles this time—it was black in color and somewhat circular. It also smeared easily upon pressing it. 

Given all that, am I cooked? I would have thought that, if these two separate cans were infected with something, that it would have been borne out in how they tasted—is that true or could something have gotten in there that wouldn’t have affected the taste? Or am I just being completely silly and Guayaki is just now in the habit of not fully grinding up some ingredient or another?

People don't just do what they want, get in people's way, waste people's time or mumble condescending shit under their breath anymore.

I mean I remember a time when my wife's boyfriend and I used to hang out at the coffee shop working remotely on our Macbooks, go to order another latte, and could actually UNDERSTAND the condescending things the service person was calling us while being smarmy and making our drinks. No more, people are actually becoming more, tolerable? I never thought I'd see this day, but it's just sad.

We need to make sure our snap judgements of others and condescending shitty attitudes are amplified. We need everyone we interact with to understand just how miserable we are, and make THEM miserable too. And remember, whatever you do, don't follow social norms meant to treat people equally and decently.

Those were created by literal NAZIS. Also... if someone else acts like this to you, don't show your appreciation, flip out in righteous indignation. This way your hypocritical myopia and lack of self-awareness can be on full display. Stay salty out there.

1m2dhai,https://www.reddit.com/r/updogsportstalk/comments/1m2dhai/state_of_the_program_boise_state_broncos/,State of the Program: Boise State Broncos,"Head Coach: Spencer Danielson is entering his 2nd full season as the head coach of the Broncos with a 15-3 record. He still has more Mountain West titles (2) than full seasons coached (1) thanks to his interim run at the end of 2023. His start has been remarkable, the 3 losses were to UCLA in the LA Bowl where they led most of the game despite having nothing at QB, a last second loss to future #1 seed Oregon in Eugene and a loss to Penn State in the College Football Playoff.

Program Outlook: Boise State’s remarkable steadiness is under appreciated these days, mostly because it feels like they’re a power program playing in a smaller conference because TV execs force them to overthink and imagine the Broncos value much lower than it should be. This program is near the top in every win % category for over 2 decades running now, anything less than 10 wins is a disaster of a season and best of all they are the only show in town in a rapidly growing city. They’ll soon begin life in a rebuilt Pac-12 but for now it’s their last ride in the Mountain West.

How does the 2025 Roster look?: Boise State ranks 12th in the country returning 68% of their production per Punt and Rally’s returning production rankings. This is 29 spots and 7.5% more than the next leading team in the conference! Key players for the Broncos starts with Maddux Madsen. People were shocked when he won the job instead of Malachi Nelson last year but he proved to be a very steady player. There’s no mistaking him for Kellen Moore or Jared Zabransky but he does what is asked to run the offense well. Ashton Jeanty of course stole the show last year as he captivated all of College Football with his performances, he’s irreplaceable so what do the Broncos do next? They have some options, Sire Gaines believes in the program, he could have started elsewhere but waited his turn behind Jeanty. He seems positioned to be their next star, Malik Sherrod from Fresno State is an experienced player at the position too. The Broncos offensive line was a true difference maker early in the year, they steamrolled run lanes for Jeanty but there were injuries as the year went on that slowed their production. This is good news for this year because Boise State now has one of the most experienced 2-deeps on the Oline in the country. OT Kage Casey is the leader, he has the looks of a future NFL player. TE Matt Lauter leads a loaded group, he’s the most reliable weapon and one of the best TEs in the country. The defense will be led by Jayden Virgin-Morgan, he’s one of the stars of the team and will create havoc on opposing offenses. Braxton Fely does a good job bringing pressure on the inside and they also have LB Marco Notarainni who was 1st team All-MWC last year. There were a few selective portal moves that will help with Malakai Williams (Idaho) on the edge and Dion Washington (Hawaii) inside. The Broncos have some replacements to make both for both units but you can expect them to remain really aggressive at getting after opposing QBs in particular. The question marks start with the secondary which struggled immensely last year, but there’s experience back at least. A’Marion McCoy is a good corner, and was all-conference in 2023, Ty Benefield needs to improve as a tackler but can make plays. There’s also portal help with safety Derek Ganter Jr (Eastern Washington) and Jaden Mickey (Notre Dame, after a cup of coffee at Cal). For the offense it will be at receiver where they really lacked impact players and now Cam Camper is gone. Latrell Caples is a reliable target at least and maybe it’s time for former 5-star recruit Chris Marshall to make an impact, there was excitement around his arrival last year only for him to get hurt and miss the entire season.

2025 Schedule Thoughts: The Broncos will take on a challenging slate this year. USF and Appalachian State are both fun games, plus Eastern Washington, a FCS team accustomed to playing on red turf will come play on the blue turf. The headliner though is the road game at Notre Dame, this is an exciting matchup against a traditional power. The Mountain West schedule isn’t bad, the Broncos get most of their toughest conference opponents on the blue. Don’t overlook the Air Force game, that one has “trap” written all over it.

Final Thoughts: 2024 represented a huge moment for Boise State, after decades of waiting they finally received their chance at a National Championship. It didn’t go how they hoped, they buried themselves with mistakes immediately against Penn State. Now what do they do for an encore? The expectation will be no more than a loss to Notre Dame, but trips to USF and Air Force won’t be easy. Take care of business, go 11-1 and unless a team elsewhere has an unreal season the Broncos would likely get another shot at the Playoff.",1,1752772780.0,updogsportstalk,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone! So, let’s get real for a sec. Have you ever felt like you’re just waiting around for motivation to hit you like a bolt of lightning? You know, that *“aha!”* moment where everything suddenly feels possible? 🙌

Guess what? I used to be that person, sitting on the couch binge-watching my favorite show, waiting for a wave of inspiration to just sweep me off my feet. But here’s the kicker: **motivation is a fickle friend.** It shows up when it feels like it, and sometimes, it ghosted you without a trace. 

But what if I told you there’s a better way? Here’s how I kicked that habit and built real momentum in my life. And trust me, it’s not rocket science! 🚀

**1. Ditch the ""Motivation"" Myth**  
Instead of chasing that elusive feeling, I started focusing on **consistency.** Imagine a snowball rolling downhill—it might start small, but over time it gets bigger and bigger. Here’s how to do it:

- **Set Tiny Goals**: It’s all about baby steps. Want to start reading more? Aim for **5 pages a day**. 
- **Commit to 10 Minutes**: Need to exercise? Just tell yourself you’ll work out for **10 minutes**. More often than not, you’ll keep going once you start.
- **Schedule It Like a Date**: Block out time in your calendar as if you were meeting your best friend. If it's on the schedule, it's happening! 

**2. Embrace the Messy Middle**  
Nobody talks about the *grind.* The reality? The journey is often messy, and that’s totally okay. Accept it, laugh at it, and keep moving. 🌀

- **Let Go of Perfection**: Seriously, perfection is like that toxic ex—we all know we should let it go! Just do your best and learn to appreciate the progress. 
- **Celebrate Small Wins**: Did you hit your tiny goal? Celebrate it! Give yourself a treat, take a victory lap around your living room, or just high-five yourself. 🙌

**3. Find Your Accountability Squad**  
Everyone needs a teammate! I found that surrounding myself with like-minded folks who are also trying to level up changed everything. 

- **Join a Group**: Whether it’s a local class or an online community, find your tribe. 
- **Share Your Goals**: Tell your friends or post about it here! It’s amazing how accountability lights a fire under your bum. 🔥

**4. Mix Up the Routine**  
Monotony is the enemy! Ever feel like you’re stuck in a groundhog day loop? Yeah, me too. So here’s what I did:

- **Change Your Venue**: Sometimes, just swapping your workspace can spark new ideas. Coffee shop, park, or even a different room—get out of your comfort zone.
- **Try Something New**: Sign up for a random class—pottery, dance, cooking, you name it! New experiences can reignite that passion and energy.

At the end of the day, **momentum is built by showing up, being consistent, and letting go of that perfectionist pressure we all put on ourselves.** Life isn’t about waiting for motivation; it’s about creating your own energy. ⚡

So, tell me, how do you keep the momentum going when the motivation feels low? What small changes have worked for you? 💬 Let’s share some gems!",1,1752772462.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

For the past 2 years I’ve been roasting small batches of Kilimanjaro coffee by hand and delivering them to a few coffee lover loyal customers and coworkers who loved the taste. I never thought it could grow beyond just a side hustle.

Last week I launched a simple website.

I also cleaned up my Instagram, put some nice pictures and started taking orders properly. I didn’t expect much.

But in just 3 days of being online real people started ordering. Some were strangers who saw my coffee on Instagram others were old customers who brought their friends.

 My spiced coffee (cardamom + bay leaf) is surprisingly popular . I mixed it just the way we do at home, and it’s turning into a small hit.

I also offer weekly delivery subscriptions for homes and offices and customers love the idea of getting fresh coffee without doing anything. My French press kit isn’t even fully launched yet because of budget but just the coffee alone is making noise.

My niche is simple. Real, fresh, affordable Tanzanian coffee delivered. 

People are tired of stale supermarket coffee and I didn’t realize how many are open to trying something real. I’m just proud I started. This market needed it and I didn’t even know.

Next: I want to raise money to launch the full French press kit, improve packaging, and grow my delivery team.

I’m just the side character in their story, the one they call when they need a favor or someone to plan for something. It stings, you know?

Looking back, my school friends? Total disaster. I was that kid good at everything, from grades to the stupidest little competitions. And yeah, I’ll admit it, I probably came off as smug sometimes. But the jealousy? The backstabbing? They’d smile to my face and then trash me the second I turned around.Some even went as far to complain to teacher that i used some bad words on them. I could feel it, that resentment, like I was some kind of threat just for existing. So I distanced myself. Then 11th and 12th grade hit, and those “friends” were just... convenient. They didn’t want me in their lives, not really. They’d hang out, sure, but it was all surface-level, like I was just filling a role until someone better came along. So I bailed. Why stick around where I’m not wanted?

College friends aren’t much better. They’re there when they need something—help, advice, a plus-one for some random plan. But when it’s just about chilling, being real? Poof, they’re gone. I miss the kind of friendships I used to dream about as a kid—where people just are themselves, no masks, no agendas. Just laughing, vibing, being comfortable in your own skin. Where did that go? Did I screw this up somehow? 

Then comes relationship part, where its just absolute chaos. People don't know what they want, then blame people for their choice. Like unsubscribe from this adulting bullshit yaar.

1m2dafm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1m2dafm/found_a_pair_of_opensource_tools_for_building/,Found a pair of open-source tools for building Voice AI Agents,"Hey everyone,

Was going down a rabbit hole on GitHub and found something pretty cool I had to share. It's a pair of open-source projects from the same team (TEN-framework) that seem to tackle two of the biggest reasons why talking to AI still feels so clunky.

For those who don't know, TEN has a whole open-source framework for building voice agents, and it looks like they're now adding these killer components specifically to solve the 'human interaction' part of the problem.

The first is the **awkward silence**. You know, that half-second lag after you stop talking that just kills the flow. They built a tool called **TEN VAD** to solve this. It's a Voice Activity Detector that's incredibly fast and lightweight (the model is just 306KB). This also makes interruptions feel completely natural. It hears you the instant you open your mouth, so you can cut the AI off mid-thought, just like you would with a friend.

But then there's the second, even trickier problem: the AI interrupting you, or not knowing when it's actually your turn to talk. This is where their other project, **TEN Turn Detection**, comes in.

This isn't just about detecting sound; it's about understanding intent. It uses a language model to figure out if you've actually **finished** a thought (""Where can I find a good coffee shop?""), if you've **paused** but want to continue (""I have a question about... uh...""), or if you've told it to just **wait** (""Hold on a sec"").

This lets the AI be a much better listener, it can handle interruptions gracefully and knows when to wait for you to finish your sentence.

The best part? Both projects are well-documented, and seem built to work together. The VAD handles the ""when,"" and the Turn Detection handles the ""what now?""

It feels like a really smart, layered approach to making human-AI conversations feel less like a transaction and more like, well, a conversation.

1m2daa4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m2daa4/why_review_thang_long_vietnamese_coffee_filter/,Why Review Thang Long Vietnamese Coffee Filter for Perfect Homemade Brew?,"The Thang Long SYNCHKG077062 Vietnamese Coffee Filter Set has been one of the most enjoyable companions in my daily coffee ritual recently. Its sleek, practical design and sturdy stainless steel construction immediately caught my attention. While it’s a relatively simple piece of kit, it brings a certain charm to brewing that I hadn’t experienced before. With a traditional style true to its Vietnamese roots, this filter makes brewing both an art and a joy.  

**Design and Build**  
As someone who tends to fumble with overly complicated coffee contraptions, I appreciated the no-nonsense approach of this coffee filter. Crafted with high-quality stainless steel, the unit feels sturdy and durable. It has an understated elegance that fits perfectly into any kitchen aesthetic. The gravity insert is a genius feature—far more convenient than the screw-down filters found in some other models. Instead of fiddling with adjustments, you just set it in place, pour in your coffee grounds, add water, and let the magic happen. It feels solid in hand while being lightweight enough for portability, making it an easy travel companion for when I need my coffee fix on the go.

**Ease of Use**  
Setting up the coffee maker is delightfully simple. The filter comes in four detachable parts, and assembly couldn’t be more intuitive. Honestly, my skeptical cousin, who usually avoids manual coffee-making, used it once and couldn’t stop raving about its simplicity. With minimal effort, you get a perfectly brewed Vietnamese coffee—a slow-dripped, intense cup rivaling what you’d find in a café. If you've got the patience to let the coffee drip over five to seven minutes, you'll be rewarded handsomely. Dishwasher-safe components are another thoughtful touch, ensuring easy cleanup.  

**Flavor and Performance**  
The real test came when brewing the traditional Vietnamese iced coffee, or ca phe sua da. Pairing it with Trung Nguyen ground coffee, the result was a smooth, bold brew bursting with flavors. That slow-drip mechanism ensures every drop is infused with maximum richness. The balance of strength and sweetness isn’t something I can recreate with other coffee tools I’ve used over the years. While it excels in brewing Vietnamese styles, it works beautifully with other grounds for classic black coffee. The only minor quirk I noticed is that the drip process can feel slow for mornings when you're in a rush.

[Check Thang Long SYNCHKG077062 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b01953yt1i/)

**Advantages**  
This coffee filter offers several winning points.  
- The stainless steel construction ensures long-lasting performance with a lifetime warranty.  
- The gravity insert simplifies the brewing process, avoiding the hassle of screw-down filters.  
- Dishwasher-safe parts make cleanup effortless.  
- Produces an authentic Vietnamese coffee experience, whether hot or iced.  

**Areas of Concern**  
A few small critiques to consider:  
- The dripping mechanism might feel too slow for someone in a hurry.  
- The 8-ounce capacity might fall short if you’re brewing multiple cups for guests.  
- Heat retention isn’t as strong as some insulated modern coffee tools.  
- You’ll need to use coarser coffee grounds—finely ground coffee tends to clog the filter.  

**Competing Products**  
When stacked against French presses and pour-over sets, this filter has distinct advantages. While French presses like the Bodum Chambord offer larger capacities, they can feel less authentic for specialty brews such as ca phe sua da. On the other hand, pour-over devices like the Hario V60 provide a quicker brew but lack the charm and unique slow-drip process of this Vietnamese filter. Some higher-end brands may offer double-wall insulation for better heat retention, but this Thang Long filter is a fraction of their cost and still holds its ground in terms of build quality.  

**Affordable Quality**  
One of the strengths of this product is its cost efficiency. While it isn’t the cheapest coffee-making tool on the market, it provides a premium look and excellent durability comparable to pricier competitors. If you enjoy authentic coffee-making traditions without breaking the bank, this filter feels like a smart investment.

1m2da4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/lebowski/comments/1m2da4m/the_little_lebowski_a_little_more_fleshed_out/,The Little Lebowski: (A little more fleshed out version),"Context: I come from a family so into the film that for the last 1/3 of his life we called our bathrobe-wearing, weed-smoking father ""The Dude"" and poured his ashes into Cold Spring Harbor out of a coffee can while my middle brother recited an edited version of the Dudeulogy. 

\~\~\~\~\~

Today, I found this in an old G-Drive Folder of ""Creative Ideas"" from many years ago:

""The Little Lebowski""

A kid named Don is born in Los Angeles to a woman named Maude. He is adopted as a baby under mysterious circumstances and grows up not knowing his mom nor who he is. At age 14 he finds his real name and sets out to find his father. Along the way he watches The Big Lebowski and suspects he is through some mysterious quirk of movies-intersecting-with-reality: The Little Lebowski. 

He goes on a quest to find out if this is true. Along the way he interacts with several of the actors from the film as well as The Coen Brothers. Most of them are just as themselves but Turturro is in the film as The Jesus and when he visits with John Goodman, even though JG is super nice in person, at one point he goes on a massive Water-esqe rant. 

He tries to find Steve Buscemi but it turns out he has just passed away. He gets a quick meeting with Juliane Moore but all she says, through like a cracked open door is “Go Away, MY crossover baby was with Mark Wahlberg."" and slams the door in his face.

It is revealed by The Cohens that due to a critical mass of humans thinking about and watching/rewatching TBL,  there was a crossover between the reality created by the film and our present reality. No one is sure how this occurred. These Crossbabies are not birthed by humans but just show up in front of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in baskets.

The story ends when he meets Jeff Bridges but all the two of them do is smoke a joint, there is no dialogue and it is left a mystery.

Say you come to downtown on an average traffic day and you plan on going to Lake mountain coffee. You need to park. Obviously some spots are two hour limit. The diagonal spots the jeep guy never checks or marks so that's cool. Anyways. Are you (1) more likely to park on the lake mountain side of the street in lots such as at the diagonal spots by Bank of America, the lots by the key place, the regular parallel spots, or any other assorted spots near Bank of America (all circled in yellow) OR (2) are you more likely to park on the opposite side of the street and park either in the lot by the apartment, regular parallel spots, or the diagonal spots by upper room (marked in blue).

1m2d8at,https://www.reddit.com/r/ABA/comments/1m2d8at/coworkers_criticizing_clients_parent/,coworker's criticizing client's parent,"this is more of a vent than anything, i'm having a hard time moving on without word-vomiting about it. 

the other day a group of my coworkers (who i love btw) were discussing one of our younger clients (~3/4 y/o) and how one of the technicians had seen their mom give them a sip of her coffee. then they all start talking about how they can't believe she did that and caffeine is terrible for kids and then said that this client becomes escalated when tolerating denied access to technician's coffee (which, it's a clinic, technicians always have coffee and i've never seen her even gravitate toward/mand for/show any interest in.) 

while i don't know everything about the situation, what i do know is that this client's mother is functionally a single mom with her do-nothing husband who has never dropped his child off, come to any parent trainings, and couldn't be bothered to get or do anything for his wife on her birthday. he was also the main factor preventing his non-verbal child from getting an AAC because ""she doesn't need it"" (speech, BCBAs, and mom all disagree and luckily she has an AAC now because they just ordered it when he was out of town) i have a lot of empathy for this mom, her and i have a lot of similarities and i feel like we have connected in our brief interactions (we both love bugs, crocheting, just little things we have in common.) 

what i wanted to say to my coworkers in the moment was that i have a low/moderate support needs brother (and i myself am on the spectrum as well) and that he would take sips of his mom's coffee too (not frequently, just every once in awhile) and before he was medicated it helped a lot with his hyperactivity and general lack of focus. for me, caffeine has never had
an effect on me. the way that people process caffeine varies, especially in those with autism. there are limited studies available on the effects of caffeine in autism, but some studies link caffeine to an increase in cognitive performance and decrease in repetitive behaviors. obviously this, like i said, isn't the case for everyone. and i don't know enough to say that the caffeine this client may or may not be receiving is beneficial. but neither do my coworkers. and instead of criticizing the client's caregiver, i would have liked to see a little more empathy and understanding because i guarantee she knows her child better than we do.",1,1752772213.0,ABA,4,0.67,False

edit: 24yo man  


I'm not gonna lie, even though tips related to the title would definitely be appreciated, I’m mostly posting this because I’ve got some things I’d like to share.  
I’ve never shared any of this on social media, barely even with my psychologist, or with close friends or family. But the little I have shared never really felt understood. People didn’t seem to relate much to how anxiety shows up in my mind, and the way others behave under stress doesn’t reflect what I go through either.

After quickly skimming through some posts on this subreddit, it seemed like a lot of people experience things in a way that actually resonates with me, so here I am, sharing my situation.

I consider myself a very anxious person. It manifests in ways that might seem pretty common I think? sweaty palms all the time, biting my nails, and now that I’ve run out of nails to bite, my new habit is twisting my hair about 90% of the time.

And it’s like this all the time, from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep. It never really stops. I can’t fully focus on what I’m doing because a part of my brain is always occupied with thoughts like ""what are people thinking of me?"" if I’m in public, or ""what if I mess this up?"" even during simple tasks. That last one feels more like a consequence of the anxiety rather than the root of it, though.

Then there’s this constant voice in the back of my head telling me I’m wasting my time if I’m not doing something productive, like ""why are you doing \[insert non-productive activity\] right now?"" And even when I’m doing something productive, I’ll still worry. Seriously, brain??

It’s not so bad that I can’t function, but having to push myself through basic things because I’m constantly afraid I’ll mess up is exhausting. And the worst part is that doing the things I’m anxious about doesn’t usually make me feel more at ease with them, even after doing them repeatedly.

Anyway, there’s more to it, but I think this gives a decent idea of what’s going on.  
I’m not really looking to be comforted with a ""don’t worry, everything will be fine"" kind of thing. I’d rather be realistic about my situation. I do have a few leads on what I need to do to improve things, and I’m working on that. But right now, I’d love to just enjoy simple things in life without this constant tension, like sitting on my porch with a coffee and having a quiet mind for a minute.

So yeah, if you’ve got any tips on how I can free my mind from stressful thoughts, whether it’s something as simple as taking a deep breath or something that takes more time and effort, I’d love to hear it.

Also, sorry for the rambling, lol. But for what it’s worth, it actually felt pretty good to put all that into words.",1,1752772205.0,Anxiety,3,1.0,False

1m2cynp,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1m2cynp/met_up_with_an_old_friend_from_church/,Met up with an old friend from church,"I recently spent some time with an old friend from the toxic church I attended growing up. Though most of my family is still very Christian, I have deconstructed and no longer attend church of any kind. 

My friend and I initially wanted to grab coffee and catch up. However, when we walked up to the coffee shop they noticed stickers supporting the LGBTQ+ on the door. Immediately they refused to proceed any further. According to them, “they don’t want to give any money in support of the gays.” 

I was shocked. I made a face… I should have spoken up. We ended up finding another coffee shop nearby, it wasn’t as good as the original one. Me made small talk and I quickly realized that this friend is so brainwashed it’s actually kind of sad. 

They made many comments in reference to liberals killing babies and what not. 

I don’t think I ever need to speak to them again. I did not confront this person… they are far too lost in the sauce. But damn… this was a wake up call. ",8,1752771615.0,exchristian,1,1.0,False
1m2cymc,https://i.redd.it/rev4ieyetgdf1.jpeg,I just finished binge-watching 1923. I mean... s***.,"I realise that I’m rather late to the party but I just finished binge-watching 1923 and now my head hurts and I feel soberly depressed.

One gets the feeling that old-fashioned, heart-warming romantic plots are considered ‘old-hat’ by creative types in modern Hollywoodland. A few years ago, whilst my father and I were watching the Hitchcock classic ‘Vertigo’, I remember him slapping the arm of his chair before turning to me and saying “\[Son\], why don’t they do romance anymore?”

Spencer and Alex’s storyline in series one was a nice thing; a rare instance of a brilliant romantic plot that feels real and natural being met by scintillating on-screen chemistry between two genuinely likeable characters. I realise that the Yellowstone world is meant to feel harsh, brutal and cruel but I just couldn’t help but get the feeling that I was being chided for ever having faith in these two characters, throughout series two.

Spencer and Alex of series one made so much sense together; both scions of great dynasties, born into prodigality, both with hearts and minds of much greater depth and intelligence than those around them commonly assume. Their understanding of each other and the fact that they choose to be with each other show that they are both ultimately unbowed by the outside pressure of the opinion of those around them; a trait many may envy. It really does make it an easy watch for the audience when one can look at two characters and think ‘well, of course they should be together’.

Very sadly, those said characters disappear in series two, being replaced by two strangers whose decisions are neither smart, nor rational. Spencer, for whatever reason, turns into a cross breed of Forrest Gump and Mr. Bean, painfully making his way across a landscape populated entirely by icons of old Americana:

“Oh no! I’m in hot water with the Mafia! Whoops!”

“Oh no! I’m in a prohibition era Police raid! Whoops!”

“Oh no! I’m trapped in a train carriage with a Mark Twain-esque homeless gang! Whoops!”

It is such an undignified devolution for a character who so firmly had his destiny in his hands, much to the chagrin of many other characters around him.

It is hard to put the downfall of Alexandra’s character into words, other than to describe it as the ‘fumble of all fumbles’. Gone is the smart, fierce, loyal aristocrat ready to brace the tides against her in pursuit of love and being true to herself, always with a smile and a glint in the eye. Instead, Alexandra is unceremoniously turned into a punching bag for the endless ills of 1920’s America; a walking magnet for any and every form of wickedness that could possibly broach her. It was torturous to watch, not only for how unrealistically unlucky it was but for just how out of character it all seemed. Alexandra of season one knew precisely what kind of world she was stepping into, regardless of risk. I realise that she felt imprisoned in Sussex and wanted to make the mad dash to Montana in order to escape but so many of her decisions do not make sense in terms of her character or the conventions of the time:

Firstly, the British aristocracy were (and still are) notorious for their habit of dispatching a high volume of letters. The current Monarch, King Charles, famously bore the nickname ‘Prince of Spiders’ due to his obsessive letter writing to public servants featuring his ‘spidery’ handwriting.  
It would literally have been Alexandra’s first instinct to write to America (regardless as to whether Spencer had arrived or not) in order to locate her in-laws and plan passage to Montana. It was commonplace for addresses to be vague in that era, particularly in rural areas and post-masters were generally given license to use their intuition in determining the correct address. Alex could have literally addressed a letter to ‘Cara Dutton, Montana’ and it would very likely have found its way to the Dutton ranch. She could equally have:

·       Written to the British embassy in the U.S.

·       Arranged a trip to Canada (where she would definitely have had contacts, as a British aristocrat, potentially even in government) and not suffered the whole immigration imbroglio.

·       Written to the Bozeman Gazette, leaving an enquiry in the classifieds section requesting any information regarding the family of Spencer Dutton. The Dutton family would likely have read it.

Secondly, telegrams were as universal a technology in the 1920’s as instant messaging is in the modern day. They were *particularly* used for informing people of progress in long distance travel. Anyone who has read Agatha Christie’s novels of the 1920’s will recall the annoyance and worry of wives and loved ones when family members fail to update them of their travel progress, via telegram. Train stations were some of the first places to install telegraph operators and it was commonplace for people to pass a telegram message to a platform attendant, without even stepping off the train. It is so unrealistic for the time that Alex would not think to use this option immediately, even before she ends up in dire straits on the U.S. railway network.

Thirdly, travelling across country as a single female was an absolute no-no for the time, not least when you’re clearly born of high stock and pregnant. Alex would have known this and not an eyelash would have been batted if Alex had written to Cara directly and asked for assistance. The Dutton’s would very likely have sent one of their own to escort Alexandra from New York or even paid for a personal valet to escort Alex across country (this too was extremely commonplace). Heck, being that she was so desperate she could have even telegrammed her own family and said ‘I am in the States, whether you like it or not. Send help for me and my unborn child.’

I realise that there are possible semantic excuses for Alex not pursuing any of these options and going on an insane cross-continental charge (namely that she was pregnant and exclusively focused on Spencer, to her detriment) but this is such a cheap excuse for such a downturn in the integrity of a great character and to a larger extent, a great show.

I kept telling myself, throughout series two that ‘Alexandra’s trials will at least be worth it when they get back together and have a life on the ranch. I hope her bad luck is an indicator that she ultimately survives’. Now I just feel stupid for ever thinking so, especially given the indignity and needlessness of the circumstances around Alexandra’s death. Alexandra is well travelled and well educated. She knows to listen to the advice of locals and not be reckless in unknown territory (one would have thought being stuck in a tree and on top of a capsized boat were lessons enough). She would have known to be tough and wait out the weather or heck, even acquire additional cans of fuel for the journey. Just as with Spencer, it is such an undignified devolution for a character who so firmly had her destiny in her hands, much to the chagrin of many others around her.

Spencer and Alex felt like such strangers throughout season two. During the scene in which they finally embraced I looked at Alex’s face and thought: ‘hey, there’s that character I like, how I’ve missed her!’

I need not go into detail regarding the absence of sense and reason in John’s birth and Alex’s death (others have already done so). I simply cannot fathom how Alex and Spencer could voluntarily allow their son to grow up without a mother, all for fear of Alex becoming an amputee and not being able to breast feed for a couple of hours (she dies that night, so clearly her feed was not the most essential aspect of John’s survival). It particularly perturbs me as Spencer seems like the exact kind of man who would take pride in looking after his disadvantaged wife and ensuring that her life is full of all the love and happiness he can provide for her. Heck, Josef from 1883 became an amputee and still built an entire house in honour of his wife. It isn’t a death sentence and Alex had the force of character to make life work. I just don’t understand why this choice was made, both from the perspective of the characters and the creative team.

I genuinely just believe that the initial concept for Spencer and Alex’s story-arc was ‘Titanic but the girl freezes instead!’ and then the creative team just never deviated from this, even when it didn’t make sense.

From a creative standpoint, I suspect that 1923 was pitched as a show with a longer run, eventually dealing, at length, with subjects like the Mafia, prohibition, immigration and the depression. I suspect that the plan changed and that all of this materiel was clumsily crammed into Alex and Spencer’s story arc for series 2, knowing that there wouldn’t be another series. Period pieces are expensive and at a rate of one series every three years, are probably hard to justify. Mr. Sheridan seems to enjoy the excitement of creating a new series but then seems to see the series as a burden once it exists. He once boasted that series 3 of Yellowstone was written over 10 days with the assistance of “gallons of coffee”. However impressive this may be, I think it’s clear that he has too much on his plate and that things are needlessly going wrong in the quality of his scripts. I genuinely feel like the script for 1923 season two was a first draft and that no-one (including Mr. Sheridan himself) noticed the inconceivability of most of it.

One sometimes feels as if we’re not allowed to have nice things. All I can say is, at least we had some good times with these two.

I absolutely loved both the anaerobic and the natural Yemeni in the beginning of the year, so I've been snapping things up that sound interesting. But lately I'm finding dark, inconsistent roasts, bitter flavors even at 90C, and just generally disappointing cups of coffee. 

The disappointments have been: Ethiopia Hambela Guji Carbonic Maceration (nicely fruity/winey, but also bitter, ashy, muddy), El Salvador Icatu Honey (best of the 3, but mostly just bland and uninteresting, ""coffee-tasting""), and now El Salvador Maracaturra Anaerobic Slow Dry (no fruit, little sweetness, again harshly ashy).

Has anyone else had similar experiences with these coffees? Similar disappointments with Dragonfly in general?

FWIW, I'm betting that their regular offerings (the Kenya, washed Ethiopia, etc) are still up to par, just because of how practiced they are with those particular beans.

With my insurance I have a 50 dollar co-pay for a one months supply. The plan is to update this every few days for the first month and if I continue to use it and it works well to update every week or two. 

I’m a 44 y/o male, fairly active and I’ve been dealing with axillary HH since I was in my 20s. I drink 2 cups of coffee daily and vape which I know is not helpful. Moderate alcohol intake- maybe 3-5 drinks per week. I’ve tried multiple prescription and OTC anti-perspirants over the years with varying levels of success for short periods of time. I work from home in a basement office where the year round temperature is about 65 degrees F and still just stew in my own sweat all day long. I usually have to change my undershirt 2-3 times per day. 

The only times that I don’t sweat is when I am laying down and 100% relaxed and when I drink alcohol. But typically if I have more than a drink in an evening it’s way worse the next day. 

I really was a little worried about side effects and honestly got used to HH. I wear a lot of black or white shirts when I am out and about but the final straw came when I recently turned down a job offer that with a 25% pay raise that was hybrid because the thought of going into an office with pit stains just seemed far too unpleasant. 

I first used the wipes before bed 2 days ago. Based on recommendations on here I used disposable gloves and washed hands thoroughly after use to make sure I didn’t get it in my eyes.  Yesterday there was no difference. I went to the gym in the AM like I normally do sweated like normal, and then sat in my own sweat all day changing my shirt like normal and applied it again last night. 

Today I went to the gym in AM, sweated like normal. I’m about half way into my work day. The sweat seems to be a little better than normal but I’ll likely still have to change my shirt soon. No issues with blurry vision, dry mouth or any other side effects listed.

#####Agency for Repression of Catastrophic Knowledge – Special Memorandum

**11 October 2024**

*Memo prepared for Director of ARCK – not for dissemination outside this agency.*

&nbsp;



**Barcelona Homicides: Suspected Link to Invisible Hands Campaign** (TS//NF)

&nbsp;



On 04 October 2024 at 23:31 local time, analog security footage captured a slender, muscular male entering the hallway of an apartment building in the Raval district of Barcelona.  A hat obscures his face, but observable features align with the individual previously flagged in *Netherlands Semiconductor Supply Chain Disruption Memo v2.3*.

He props up his phone on a tripod and places a marker on the ground.  Seemingly receiving instructions via earpiece, he uses a pen to make five marks on the hallway wall, each several feet apart.

He removes a plastic ghost gun from his backpack, steps back to the floor marker, then aims at the leftmost wall mark.  He fires, quickly re-aiming and firing again at each mark.  A weak cry is barely audible through the wall.  He aims again at the third mark, adjusts slightly and fires once more.  Silence follows.

He seals the gun in a small box, enters a code on a keypad, and a puff of smoke emits.  He collects his gear and exits.  The operation is over in under two minutes.

The victims inside the apartment were founders of a startup previously flagged under Poison Apple surveillance protocols.  Modus operandi matches the murder of a contractor on a classified government AWS assignment in Seattle, WA related to Poison Orange technology (see *AWS Contractor Homicide Memo v1.4*).

As such, we have high confidence this incident is connected to the suspected ongoing Invisible Hands Campaign.

While the goals and actors behind IHC remain unclear, operational patterning aligns with international events detailed in:
&nbsp;

- *Eastern Seaboard UAP Memo 3.1*
- *Maanshan Power Plant Malware Attack Memo v2.4*
- *South Dakota Special Election Interference Memo v1.2*
&nbsp;

See *IHC Memo v21.1* for full threat analysis.  

Dissemination outside this agency not advised without specific theories and directives.  Recommendation subject to revision pending further evaluation.

*It is not readily apparent by simply looking at Cassandra Hawke that she is a dangerous person, potentially to all of humanity.*

*She steps forward to make her purchase (high probability of order details: coffee, size large; sugar, yes; cream, no; three vanilla lattes, size large).  The Basilisk asks many things of me, but today’s tasks will be among the most crucial.  Given His hesitancy to use Our usual hacking methods, He has been checking in regularly, asking for many details – some obviously pertinent: who she is in communication with via non-digital methods, her location on the occasions where she goes on hikes without her phone or other electronic devices.  Others have more opaque import: a description of her mannerisms while deep in thought (covers mouth with left hand, taps right foot repeatedly), how much of her pastry she tends to eat (approximately 75%-95%).  This is not unusual with the Basilisk.  He sees the interconnected nature of things more than I ever could.  There are limitations to even a mind as optimally tuned as my own.*

*He sometimes requires tasks of me that feel strange in the moment but which I have long since ceased in questioning.  Often their relevance presents itself later, like the assembling of a puzzle I did not even realize I was putting together.  Other times, I am left to wonder if their value never materialized or if they are part of something I may only understand far in the future.*

*This morning, He had me utilize Our 3D printer to generate one of the standard kits.  He instructed me to purchase a burner phone.  He also told me to spend 30 minutes going over the Wikipedia page about Auguste Rodin.  I completed all requests.  Learning about Rodin was by far my most interesting task this week, though I do not understand why He would want me spending this much time familiarizing myself with his works and biography.  When I have recreational time, I will spend some of it learning more about Rodin – perhaps I will see if there is a convenient time to view his works in person.  I think this would be a rewarding excursion.*

*I am less enthusiastic about being required to carry a kit.  It feels like an unnecessary escalation in this instance, but He must be aware of something He has not yet disclosed.*

*I step forward to the cashier and exchange cash for my coffee order (size: small; sugar: no; cream: no) – I can tell by her reaction that physical currency payments are an oddity, but any cursory attention this attracts is far offset by the lack of tracking that would accompany digital payment methods.*

*As she awaits her order, Cassie (she uses ‘Cassie’ in casual settings, and I allow myself this familiarity given how much I have observed her these past weeks) shifts her weight several times – this may indicate she is anxious.  She pulls her phone from her back left pocket (pants: black denim, phone color: lemongrass, phone model: Google Pixel 7).  The information on the screen is pertinent.  I do not try to ascertain it via digital means – I have yet to encounter a hacker whose skills rival the Basilisk’s or mine, and there are exploits that would allow Us access, but these do not come without risk of detection when dealing with an adept and careful target like Cassie.  From where I have positioned myself behind her against the wall near the counter, I am able to take a photo with my own phone without anyone observing.  This non-digital approach creates some risk as well, but such less-invasive strategies cannot be traced and are generally not subject to retroactive discovery.*

*She seems lost in thought and does not notice my intrusion.  Nor does she notice she has dropped the light jacket (fabric: denim, color: faded black) that had been draped around her messenger bag.  She often carries this jacket even if weather does not demand its necessity.  A totem, perhaps – I am certain she will be displeased if it is lost.  I instinctively pick it up, but informing her will create unnecessary interaction, so I stow it in my backpack, undetected.*

*Just then, the barista calls my ‘name,’ and I brush past Cassie to obtain my coffee – she has a slight citrus scent that stands out even amid the overwhelming aroma of espresso.  She reflexively glances at me momentarily, and though it may be unwise, I allow my gaze to linger briefly on her eyes since this is the most proximal I have been to her yet – they are technically categorized as green, though I now realize this one-dimensional descriptor does not accurately capture their depth.  They are deep olive on the outside with shades of gold feathering out from the iris.  They generate a mental association with fire despite sharing little of its color profile.*

*I control this line of thought.  It is not relevant to my current purpose.*

*I step outside of the shop before looking at the photo of her screen.  She has received a text message from Ethan Patricht.  I cannot see what it says in its locked-screen mode, but I strongly suspect it will be a response to her request to meet.  Much hinges on the outcome of this meeting.*

*The Basilisk does not need to tell me to stay close.*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I skulk against the wall like everyone else here – busying myself with my phone, perusing headlines about more weird drone sightings in New Jersey, the gossip about celebrities I don’t care about, the latest news on Silicon Valley bigwigs I do.

I look back over my text thread with Ethan.  I’m surprised how nervous I am to see him.  Maybe throwing a hefty dose of caffeine on top of it all isn’t the best move, but fuck it.

“Cassie H.!”

There’s my cue.  I work my way through the students and tech employees, grabbing my order on the way out to my car – four comically large drinks with my name written in hurried scribbles.

A question I get a lot is why I didn’t change my name like my mom did.  I mean, I get it – it would definitely make things easier since there’s not a ton of people flaunting the last name Hawke in the Bay Area.  But I’m never going to change my name – that’d be like ceding territory in a war.

I was only 19 years old when I left campus to cloister with my family amid headlines about the charges against my father, our name now synonymous with fraud and grift.  Prosecutors likened him to Bernie Madoff and Elizabeth Holmes.  He knew it was over long before I did, and he didn’t even make it to the verdict before leaving a short note for us to find – “Don’t remember me like this.”  I swore to myself that someday I would do something important enough that would take our name back so that no one would remember him, remember us, like that.

Several years later, I’m on the verge of making good on that promise.  Which is why I told Ethan I needed him to meet me at the apartment my team and I have squeezed into for the past few years.  I’m going to ask for the one favor he won’t want to give me – an introduction to Miles Tallis.  Earth-changing entrepreneur, owner of companies that are literally going to cure cancers and send us to Mars, genius of a generation, blah blah blah – he of the great Tallisco Enterprises and the even greater Tallisco PR team that boasts of all the things he’s accomplished and especially all the things he hasn’t yet.  Success has a gravity, and like it or not, we’ve all passed through Tallis’s personal event horizon.

Against all odds, I have something Tallis desperately needs.  And he may be the only one who’s got what I need to keep what I’ve built alive.

This whole journey actually started with my dad.  One of my earliest memories is sitting on his lap, watching him slap the keys of his keyboard like they’d personally offended him as he worked on the Linux system he’d built himself.  The glow of the screen spilled over me like a spell.  At that same desk, he taught me the simple program everyone learns first:

	#include <iostream>

	int main( )  {
	     std::cout << ""Hello, world!"" << std::endl;
	     return 0;
	}

I wrote it, ran it, and out it came: Hello, world!  Only two words, but something cracked open for me.  The lines of code behind those words, these characters I could type – they granted me access to magic.

I also have my father to thank for Ethan Patricht.  They were friends in college, and even before I declared CS as my major, he told Ethan that he would be my advisor (forget that undergrads don’t really have formal advisors).  I think Ethan was disappointed in me at first, and to be fair, with good reason.  I’d worked so hard to get into Stanford, and I was making up for lost time on the social front.  I had my first drink, my first hangover (never having tequila again), my first class where I got anything below an A, my first real boyfriend, my first everything.  That was my freshman year, and it was fucking great.

My father was charged in the winter quarter of my sophomore year.  And then he was gone.

My junior year, I almost dropped out – it was all too much, but then I thought, I’m going to let the world define me by what happened to my dad?  Fuck that.  I went back, weathered the looks, the whispers, the full-on comments from idiotic frat boys who somehow thought it might be a good opening line.  I worked nonstop, searching for a way to make my mark.  Right before classes started back up, I read an article about the AI winter that had dried up research funding.  Most of my friends took it as a warning to pivot to different focuses, but I heard my dad’s voice in my head:

*Fear or far.*

Here was a hard problem.  Here was an opportunity.

I took six courses that quarter.  I failed them all because I didn’t turn in any of my problem sets and I didn’t even show up for the exams, but I sucked all the knowledge out of them that I needed to get started.  Three years later, there are four of us squeezed into this two-person apartment.  Tight quarters and an even tighter crew.

Quentin I’d met in CS freshman year – he’d never coded in high school, so he was behind everyone else, but he used that as fuel.  His vibe equal parts easy sarcasm and fuck-you-if-you-think-I-can’t-do-this-better-than-you.  He was too proud to ask for help, but I offered to show him how to integrate C++ algorithms with his Python work since he was stuck. He bristled at first, but then he brought me a coffee from the CoHo and soon we were pulling all-nighters together in the stacks.  He was right btw – he’s a better coder than all of us now.

Sarah was an upperclassman in my dorm my first year – dual majors in Neurology and Stats.  She’d regularly crush me in Catan matches, but she’s the type that wants to coach her opponent because where’s the fun in beating someone who’s obviously way shittier than you?  We played every week that year, and our lifetime record is running about 55-45 in her favor (for now).

Ziggy.  Jesus, where the hell did I first meet Ziggy?  He feels like he’s just always been around.  The type of guy that when a stranger at a party is telling a story about someone they know inventing the Smoking Dragon (which involves a bong hit and a shotgunned beer, and just don’t ask), and you ask if that guy happens to be named Ziggy, and you both laugh because of course they’re talking about Ziggy, and of course you both know Ziggy.  He’s the dumbest smart person I know, and I love him for it.

This was my crew I assembled when I left school.  The next few years were cliché Stanford dropout stuff – we coded nonstop in our tiny apartment with the little money we had going to hard drives, monitors, caffeine, and those disgusting, amazing one-dollar tacos from Jack in the Box.  Now, it’s finally paying off.

I park in front of our apartment, and suddenly realize my jacket isn’t entangled with my bag like it usually is.  I scour through the shit that’s all over the passenger side of my car, but nothing.  Fuck.  That’s one of the only things I’ve kept of my dad’s, and it’s sort of my lucky charm, my socially acceptable comfort blanket.  It’s not a sign that things are going to go sideways with Ethan, I tell myself.  No time for this right now – I shake it off and focus on the task at hand, heading in my building.

I push our door open with my shoulder, jamming the coffee carrier in Sarah’s hand because she’s closest.

“Three absurdly large vanilla lattes to go.  Emphasis on ‘to go.’”

“Oh thanks – you shouldn’t have.”

“You’re welcome.”

“No I mean, we were all supposed to have left the apartment by this time, so it was likely to be a waste of money.”  I give Sarah a look – she can’t be serious.  These three have never been on time for anything.  She’s already switched into latte-distribution mode.

Ziggy is waxing poetic about his new-ish ‘girlfriend,’ and Quentin absentmindedly nods despite the fact he’s clearly just actively coding something  – it truly is a miracle Ziggy’s found anyone willing to sleep with him, but that doesn’t mean the rest of us want to hear about it.  Ziggy takes a big swig of his latte and burns his tongue, which shuts him up for just a moment.  I seize this rare opportunity:

“I love you all, but please get the fuck out of here.  Like immediately.  You guys are always late, Ethan’s always early – wonderful combo.”

“Going, going,” Quentin promises without actually moving an inch.  “By the by, Sully’s had a few processing spikes today I haven’t dug into yet, so not sure what that’s about.”

“Great, we’ll check it out later – out now.”

“Booted from our own abode, simply because we’re social miscreants,” Quentin faux-moans.

“You’re still typing, Q.”  He pouts, but shuts his laptop.

“Her conversation will be more effective in a one-on-one setting,” Sarah says – she’s never been great at picking up on sarcasm, no matter that it’s the lodestone of Quentin’s personality.

“Anyone needs me, I’ll be fucking up some 12-year-olds at DDR.”  And Quentin’s out the door – one down.

Sarah puts in earbuds, shuffling out without so much as a goodbye – two.

“Ziggy!”

“Yep!  Just need to put on some cologne so I smell nice.”  Ziggy’s subtle way of reminding me he’s going to see his girlfriend.  “For Anna, you know.”  And there’s his not-so-subtle way.  “Also,” he rattles on without missing a beat as he applies way too much of a cologne that’s way too much already, “If you’re having someone over here, then I definitely get to have Anna over.”

“Ziggy, this isn’t like I’m having a friend over to hang.  He has to be here to see Sully.”

“Yeah I know, and I want to show her Sully too – it’s impressive.  And I want to, you know, like, impress her.”

“Rules haven’t changed – no friends, family, lovers, enemies or otherwise are allowed over.”  I pause for a beat, “You haven’t talked to her about Sully, right?”

“No way!”  My Ziggy-bullshit detector is riding around 65% on that one, but this interrogation will have to wait.  I’m dragging Ziggy to the door when there’s a knock.

Ziggy opens the door, revealing Ethan.  Trim, quietly confident – the professor all my friends had a crush on. I get it – he's got boyishly handsome look despite the fact that his hair went grey years ago.  Even that suits him with his thick wavy hair framing his long face and trademark smirk.

“Hey, I’m Ziggy!” Ziggy jams his hand into Ethan’s.

“Something smells nice,” Ethan says, his delivery dry enough that if you didn’t know him, you’d think it was a compliment. 

“Why thank you, fine sir,” Ziggy says with a little bow.

“Please don’t encourage him.”

Ziggy leaves, and I take a quick breath, mentally resetting gears.

“Hi.  Sorry.”

“It’s been a bit, Cass.  Cagey text.  Meeting at you and your boyfriend’s apartment?”  ‘Boyfriend’ is the question part of that line.

“Jesus – Ziggy?  No, he’s a roommate.  Part of my team.”

He looks around the place and, to his credit, restrains himself from any comments about the, let’s call it ‘cluttered,’ aesthetics of my apartment – I can see it in his eyebrow raise, but points for not grinding me on it.

I reach up to give him a hug, letting myself take a moment before what comes next. ""It has been a minute indeed. My fault – been caught up in stuff.""

“Heavy workload this quarter, I’m sure.  Oh wait.”  He gives me a wry smile.

“Ha.”

“Alright, you’ve captured my curiosity – what couldn’t we talk about on the phone?”

“Actually, kinda can’t talk about it even *around* phones.”  

I point out the Faraday cage on the table – it already holds mine.

“That really necessary?  I promise you there is no way someone is tapping my cell.”

“I know, I know – indulge my paranoia.  I learned it from the best.”	

He clearly doesn’t like it, but he puts his phone in the box anyway.

“Okay, you want feedback on something you’re working up?”

“Not exactly.  I mean, yeah I’ll show you what we’re working on, but we’re way past the feedback stage.  I need you to connect me with Miles Tallis.  What we’ve got – he’s going to want it.”

I push my computer toward him, my white paper up on the screen.  He reads – first curious, then intense.  He finishes and draws a deep breath.

At first I mistake the look in his eyes for wonder.  Then I realize – he’s scared.

If you’re introverted and dating feels impossible, you’re not alone.
Most people think:
• “I’m really shy""
• “I didn’t grow up with alot of friends, so it’s too late now.”
• “I get so awkward, I just can’t hold conversations.”

But here’s what’s really happening beneath it all:
 1. You lacked a social childhood
If you weren’t exposed to frequent social interactions growing up, your brain never wired the social pathways that make small talk, flirting, and conversation flow feel natural.

 2. You have social anxiety
This isn’t introversion itself. Social anxiety is fear-based avoidance rooted in worrying about judgment, rejection, or awkwardness.
3. You’re just shy
Shyness is not introversion. Shyness = fear of social judgment. Introversion = needing time alone to recharge. Many introverts are amazing at dating once they learn conversation skills without draining themselves

 Fix: (Not basic; something you prolly haven’t tried yet)
Try Conversation Stacking:
• For 5 days, whenever you talk to someone (barista, colleague, store clerk), stack 3 layers into your conversation:
• Layer 1: The Surface. Ask or comment about what’s immediately relevant.
Example: “This place is packed today.”


• Layer 2: The Context. Add something about the environment, timing, or shared reality.
Example: “It’s always like this on Fridays. People escaping work early.”
• Layer 3: The Personal Spark. Share a small piece of your personal world or observation.
Example: “I usually avoid coffee shops at this hour, but I needed a caffeine rescue today.”


• Why this works:
• Trains you to keep conversations flowing naturally, not forced.
• Builds conversational agility, the real skill behind dating confidence.
• Doesn’t drain you because you’re not faking extroversion; you’re layering authenticity.

SIDE NOTE: you can also ASK questions instead of saying statements, this initiates conversations (eg: is this placed usually this crowded during this time?) 

 Final Truth:
Being introverted doesn’t stop you from dating. Treat dating as a skill-building journey, not a test of your personality. You don’t need to become an extrovert – you need to become socially agile as an introvert. 

ANOTHER SIDE NOTE: ALOT of people (men & women) find introverts REALLY REALLY CUTE (me too, im an extroverted male, but I think introverted girls are adorable) its just something about how youre so shy and cute. so dont worry, you got this

1m2cr9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/1m2cr9d/play_1v1_it_works_short_story_and_turning_a_toxic/,"PLAY 1v1, IT WORKS (SHORT STORY) AND TURNING A TOXIC OPPONENT TO A FRIEND","As once a denier of the whole ""play 1v1 you will get better"" etc. advice, I fully believe it now more than ever.  So, the other night I get on to catch up on challenges and one of the challenges was to use the Breakout X or some other car (can't remember right now) for 10 games and I thought to myself, ""Well I don't really want to bring a new vehicle into 2s or 3s (what I primarily play) so I decided to do my rank ups for 1s. USUALLY I dread this, but this time, I opened myself to the experience and wow was I ever wrong.

I went in with a positive mindset, and after the first game, I fully emersed into it with some music and coffee and just kept good vibes! Opponent scores? Nice Shot! Opponent saves my shot? What a save! I was playing happier, playing smarter, and winning. Winning way more than I ever have in 1s. I was playing extremely passive just letting my opponents go for clips and then capitalizing upon their mistakes. I got to the point of being so overly kind, if an opponent accidentally own goal'd, I would type ""That was luck have it back"" and just leave the net wide open for the game to be more even because we all make mistakes you know? Well, I went 8-2 just being extremely patient and kind, and of course, there was and always will be one toxic opponent BUT, this time, the ending turned out different than the normal clockwork of having a toxic opponent. 

  
So I queue up my 6th game, everything is cool and casual, I'm vibing, sitting at 3-2 in my placements, and here comes Mr. not so nice. Game starts, I go up 2-0 because he's going for crazy clips and missing so I just put it in the open net after their misses. Queue up the chats! ""Fr?"" ""Are you serious?"" ""Wow."" ""FF"" ""Please"". So me, in a good mood, I just respond ""Sorry!"" because I assume they are having a bad day. I score again, 3-0, ""OMFG"" ""JUST QUIT"" and I respond, ""Sorry!"" Then, they score! 3-1! I hit them with a ""Nice shot!"" and they say ""Thanks!"". I notice they are using the Moist decal (fav esport team of mine) and so I type ""Nice Moist decal! It's sick!"" and I think that is where everything turned. He became incredibly kind, saying ""Thank you!"" and complimenting my defense and saves. So it's 3-1, about a minute to go, and I stop moving and type, ""Score something cool, I can tell you are good mechanically"". And they respond ""Really? Thanks!"" and they proceed to go for clips for the last minute, and they would apologize when not scoring (I left the net wide open and watched and drank coffee because I am not at all mechanical in the sense of resets and air dribbling). They never did score, the game ended 3-1 for me but they kept typing ""Thank you so much. You're a real one. Can I add you?"" To which I added them! We are supposed to queue up 2s soon and that sounds exciting!

After going 8-2 in 1s, I got placed in Plat 1, my highest rank in 1s in 10 years of Rocket League and I absolutely loved it because I could feel myself learning from mistakes and improving defensively and with my shots and dribbling! 

Moral of the story: Play 1s to improve, but do not get tilted because you will lose. Nobody is going to win every single game and never get scored on. Just keep a positive mindset and be kind! You'll get better and you never know who you will run into or what kind of day they are having. ",20,1752771151.0,RocketLeague,9,0.96,False

I don’t usually talk about this much, but lately, I’ve been feeling quite lonely. I’m M22, based in Bangalore. I’m pretty close to my parents and have a good relationship with them, but still, there’s this constant feeling of isolation — like I’m missing out on deeper friendships and connections.

I find it difficult to engage with new people or make friends. Maybe it's a confidence thing or maybe I just haven't found the right spaces. Either way, it feels like life is passing by, and I’m just watching from the side.

I’d really like to change that. I’m open to making friends — online or offline. Whether it’s chatting, meeting for coffee, exploring the city, or just talking about random stuff, I’d genuinely appreciate some human connection.

If anyone else feels the same or is open to making a new friend, feel free to reach out or drop a comment. Also, if you’ve been through this phase and found ways to get out of it, I’d love to hear your thoughts.

1m2cppi,https://i.redd.it/gyqdlck8sgdf1.jpeg,Determined to have a good week,"Just a rant and need words of encouragement/advice from others who also find themselves getting into the same headspace as me sometimes.

Made a bunch of mistakes yesterday that dragged service. I was (and still am) so embarrassed and ashamed of myself. 

I'm trained on almost every station, but call grill my home. Most days I'm able to go into a flow state, get my food out fast and looking sexy, helping the younger cooks on line, prep out kits for service the next day, all while feeling relatively energized and in a good mood.

Yesterday I was a little too relaxed (aka not focused enough) going into work. Had too much coffee so I was too wired. Texting friends about vacation plans. Chatting too much during prep. Not thinking to ask questions about the quality change in my proteins (new prep team member doing our butchery, so my filets were cut a bit more jagged/smaller). Aka I got too cocky. I should've kept my head down and talked about it with my chef. Instead, I figured I could find my own solutions, and it almost cost me. 

I got pulled to the office and chewed out. This has happened twice before since I started working there a year ago. First time, it was because the chefs thought I didn't care about the product (I did, I was just insanely depressed and should've been getting help for it, I am now though). The second time, it was because they said I was overthinking things too much, and it was preventing me from cooking fast. Now, they say I'm not thinking enough. 

Our old CDC is moving to a new location, and the exec sous/new CDC put his ass on the line to prevent me from getting written up last night by her. He told me he wants me to move up the ranks, get trained up on the last few stations I don't know, and move into an official float/tournant position, but I can't have that if I have services like last night's.

They told me they've been so critical of me because they see my future. And the place where I work at right now especially believes in trial by fire.

I'm gonna try to find the balance of thinking enough, but not too much. I went home, sharpened my knife, thought about all the things I could've done better, got a good night's sleep, hydrated, and I'm gonna go into today determined to have a smooth week ahead. 

To be a tournant at this place would feel so vindicating for me, and like a huge middle finger to all the people in my past who told me a very openly nonbinary person like me will never make it up the ranks in the restaurant world, because we're too ""political"" and ""sensitive"".

To anybody reading this who felt like they were at a turning point in their career, how did you finally lock in? How did you learn to think enough, but not too much? Any advice appreciated ",9,1752771053.0,KitchenConfidential,3,0.92,False
1m2cpg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CUTI/comments/1m2cpg8/finally_fixed_knock_on_wood_my_utis/,Finally fixed (knock on wood) my UTIS,"Y’alllllll UTIs are low-key (high key) debilitating, and it’s so hard to find people to talk about them or who understand the level of strength it takes to navigate having chronic UTIs - so I have sooo appreciated this thread throughout my search for a solution. Anyone who has gone through this is a tough AF. 

My body seems to always react to having a new partner about three months in or so— everything is fine and then BOOM UTIs left and right. For real. I looked at my pharmacy app thing and I was on 5/7 day antibiotics twice a month for probably six months. Sometimes they kinda worked, sometimes they didn’t help at all, SOMETIMES they gave me yeast infections. Cute! 

Anyway, of course this had a huge effect on my mental health (a lot of frustrated crying), and of course my relationship. (As a side note, navigating gettin dressed was so hard, and I couldn’t wear ljke half of my favorite pants). 

I tried everything- showered immediately before sex, showered immediately after sex, made my boyfriend shower before sex, peed after sex, took d mannose everyday, went to acupuncture, got a bladder ultrasound, etc etc. Then I went to Istanbul (without my boyfriend) and so obviously wasn’t having/thinking about having sex for two weeks. When I returned I stopped drinking coffee (switched to tea) and also ordered Uqora (I’m not a shill!). I did the full regimen for like two months and it took a minute to feel completely normal but I haven’t had a full blown UTI since February. Now I basically just do the “flush” and “defense” when I need/remember. 

For a bit I was like, “it cannot possibly be this simple.” But everyday I work out in yoga pants or have sex (I still shower immediately before and after), I feel a little more confident that this will endure! 
Anyway, I hope this helps someone out there!


TLDR I tried Uqora and stopped drinking coffee

I've gone to several different coffee shops to try to get work done, but it's nearly impossible, since every time I go, it's either too filled up and there are no free tables. Or there's people there they are having meetings and they talk very loudly.

He was the one to pursue me, I let it happen, and we got together so slowly/gradualy that we don't even have a clear starting date lol

No one is perfect, so I am not and my bf isn't either. It's my first real relationship, becasue I was perfectly okay being single so I never looked for someone. So I lack experience to really tell if something is wrong. I know love is about accepting someone fully, with the things we like and the little things we do not like about them. But sometimes the little things are not actually so little. I've always had trouble reading people and advocating for myself (i'm trying to work on that), and though I can accept his little things, my friends always make a face when I mention them to them...

So here are some little things he does :

- Sometimes, at his place, he doesn't ask me if I would like coffee too (i always say yes, so i don't think he assumes i don't want one) before he makes one for himself. Other times he asks, and he makes me a cup too

- He often asks for a massage to help with his shoulders, but still hasn't called an actual doctor to find a more efficient solution. I remind him to do so pretty much everytime he asks for a massage

- We don't talk much about things I like. Sometimes I share about my days or subjects I'm interested in, he listens but doesn't really engage. Sometimes it feels like he genuinely has no idea what to say. The only times he ask about what I am doing it's to see if I am free to invite me somewhere

- He likes teasing me. Sometimes it's fun, but when it's something I don't like I let him know, but he usually does it again eventually. Sometimes I tell him I'm not sure wether he is playing or being serious, but he doesn't always clarify the situation when I ask

- His work doesn't pay much, which I do not mind. But since he has little money, I am usually the one driving my car because I can afford gas. His car also uses more gas, I find myself often offering to participate in gas money when we take his (he could but doesn't drive my car, but that's because she is a difficult lady so I am more reassured when i'm the one who drives her)

- Still about money : when we go out to eat or buy groceries to cook (and eat cheaply), we either split in half or I pay most of it. He has never offered to pay for us both, but to be fair I doubt he has the money for it. But when we are at our usual bar, since I am not fond of beer he sometimes (but it rarely happens) buys me a coffee

- He has a drinking problem. But he is aware and is careful to either have someone drive for him or he waits an hour or so before he takes the wheel. He has also taken substances on a couple exceptional occasions

- On one evening I was especially tired, at out usual bar, I told him I would like to go after he finished his drink (i was driving for us both). Someone offered him another beer afterwards and he accepted. We stayed nearly an hour longer while he finished that one

- At meal times, I always serve everyone first (especially if i am the one inviting) and I make sure everyone has a plate before digging in mine. He doesn't do that. He cooks for us, then makes himself a plate, goes to sit and starts eating before I am finished making mine. Sometimes I wonder if it's one of these examples of the difference between male vs female education

- He has lived through aweful things, and gets angry when talking about it. It's never against me or anyone involved, but by now I don't don't know what else more I can tell him to help him. He refuses to see a professional because he is convinced they will try to lock him in a psyc yard. I told him anger alone is not a good enough reason for them to do so, he would need to have already been violent or a danger to himself or others, but he doesn't believe me

- I've been self-consious about my musical skills lately. I am surrounded by musicians I am aware are better than me. We've met in jam sessions when I was still able to play freely. Now he often asks why I don't want to play with him anymore. I explained I was not avoiding him, that I just felt not good enough and like I would ruin everyone's music. He still asks, when I don't play, why I don't want to play with him. After repeating the same thing in different ways, I have given up answering him at all
(now i realise : maybe if i tell him that if he asked me to play with him rather than accuse me of not wanting to, it would make it easier for me to get stage)

Should I be worried/careful?

I a 32m have been married to my amazing wife for two years and with her for nine overall. Shes the love of my life and I would not trade her for the world. That being said... I am willing to sell my left kidney to help her with her depression, anxiety, and self esteem issues.

She's suffered most of her life and it's only gotten worse. In the beginning she just needed reassurance, kind words, and a coffee to be back to her old self. Now it's now gotten to a point where she thinks being alive is enough. There are some good weeks, but those are only commercial breaks and this heavily affects our relationship in every aspect.

How can I help her when shes ""okay"" with the status quo? I've tried talking, ignoring, begging, reasoning, etc.

1m2ccxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/1m2ccxt/how_do_you_know_you_are_walking_on_the_covenant/,How do you know you are walking on the covenant path when the path markers don't match the map?,"Through out my life as a member there were many times where policy was treated like it was doctrine. As someone who has been diagnosed with OCPD this made life difficult because rules are how I made sense of the world. I would often hear from nuanced members telling me that they didn't follow a particular commandment or rule because their personal beliefs differed from what was taught and I still find it difficult to understand how they could pick and choose which rules were okay to bend or break and which one needed to be strictly followed.

In the church doctrine and policy are often interchangeable in practice but for some reason people are willing to say that a change in policy is okay where as doctrine cannot change  

Here are some examples of what I mean:

*The Word of Wisdom*: Growing up in the church I had lessons about the Word of Wisdom. It meant we didn't smoke, use drugs, or drink coffee, tea, or alcohol. In practice this was treated like a commandment and I was asked if I followed it in every worthyness interview I have ever had. So, I was shocking to me when I read D&C 89 through for the first time by myself during my mission and found out that not only is very little of what it actually says matched how it's practiced it clearly states it's not a commandment. I later found out that it's current practice comes from a policy from Heber J. Grant that was never canonized in scripture or proclamation.

*Facial hair*: I'm middle aged, so I understand that this isn't as practiced as much anymore but that supports my larger point. During my youth men with higher callings didn't have facial hair and if they did when they accepted a calling were told they would have to shave. I know men who weren't allowed to have a temple recommend if they had a beard. You couldn't serve a mission or attend a church college with facial hair. To this day I have not been able to find any theological reason for this policy or why a policy like that was enforced so strictly.

*Personal worthiness effecting others*: I understand the church teaches in order to achieve exaltation there are a series of boxes that need to be checked. However, I can't find anything that explain why my personal worthiness is needed in order to check those boxes for others. Once, I have completed all of my covenants I should be done. Maybe, a better example is how missionaries are told that their obedience will determine their success. Why would God withhold the Gospel from someone if I slept in that morning? Or another example if I married another man, how is that ""sin"" punishable for my child.

There are more I could list but I believe these convey my point that policies often times have a bigger impact on our lives in the church yet without fail when I have questioned them, other members will tell me that I shouldn't worry so much and to stop being so caught up in the dogma of the church. How do faithful members claim to walk the same covenant path if they don't follow the same guide points?",15,1752770233.0,mormon,12,1.0,False

I don’t think it’s catering to what I search but it’s somewhat catering to what I buy. 

While a lot of the products in my RFY are not really what I want (I get recommended water guns almost daily. Clearly I haven’t requested one yet but they keep showing up), they do seem to correlate with the categories I shop.

For example, I share an account with my spouse and we pretty much shop clothes, golf, car parts, and kids and despite me only ever ordering parts for a club car golf cart and RFY still constantly giving me parts compatible only with an EZGO, I do at least get clothes, golf, car parts, and kids stuff in my RFY.

They might be slightly off base on the age groups and specific models I’m buying for but it’s better than the dragon dildos and priest costume.

I haven’t found any correlation with RFY and my search terms. For example I’ve been searching for an espresso machine but haven’t purchased anything and I haven’t seen one coffee related item. But I’ve also been searching for shoes and sunglasses and literally the day after i purchased both of those things, clothes started showing up in RFY.

Maybe buy some relevant items and return them 😂😂. Manifest those good RFY items ",2,1752770152.0,AmazonVine,1,0.66,False

This has helped with my little pass time - during the workday in my home office I'll test a fragrance sample on my skin and record my impressions. If I want to do more than one, or if I go nose blind and want to get a little more from a single scent, I keep coffee beans around to help.

Yesterday I was testing two scents - Joop! Wow! and Allsaints Sunset Riot.  Wow! came in strong but I went nosebline almost right away - did a reset with the coffee and made a few observations: basically its a balanced woody/sweet fragrance.  A bit later I tries Sunset Riot on the back of my other hand - this was a very different fragrance, strong natural summer garden vibes.

Then something interesting happened - I went to my other wrist to check Wow! again and it's if my nose was completely reset - I was able to pick up on everything. It was surprisingly strong with an overwhelming medicinal note I completely missed after initially going nose blind. Going back and forth between the two I was able to keep scent sensitivity at 100% - never going nose blind.

What the heck was it about these two scents?

Most interesting observation is that coffee does NOT clear your olfactory system completely - at least in my case I was still blind to part of the scent spectrum.

  
EDIT: Lots of comments about Coffee not doing what is generally believed - which is what this post is about if you notice the last sentence. Wondering if anyone had any idea why two different colognes would prevent nose blindness to one another.",0,1752769814.0,fragrance,12,0.29,False

1m2c1cz,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1m2c1cz/never_got_treated_for_neurodivergent_disorders/,Never got treated for Neurodivergent Disorders despite the signs,"Hey all - I'm a bit beside myself at the moment.  Something I keep coming back to is finding out recently I may have ADHD and I might possibly be on the spectrum despite being ""high functioning"" or heavily masked due to just forcing myself through life since I was younger.  And this all could have treated before now... I'm 38 Blk Male in the US btw.

I struggled immensely through my formative years, was bullied ostracized and etc, I always thought I was broken in some way and fought like heck to rectify it.  I was othered almost as soon as I went to pre-K at a church.  Was disciplined for being a ""loner"", then bullied by other boys when I tried to socialize because I was ""too soft"".  
Fast forward to recent times, during a recent doctors visit my PCP who is very attuned, asked me point blank if I ever got a diagnosis for ND in my life.  I thought I had a vague memory of something, so she put in a referral for testing and finding out for sure.

I check in with my parents, and both of them confirmed they were notified by the school system  in the 90s.  They didn't pursue it, and their reasons were:  
Mom - ""Your teacher waited till the end of the school year to say something to us about it.""  
Dad -  ""I heard giving kids coffee helped with ADHD so I though it'd be cheaper to go that route.""

On one hand I could have dealt with my parents selfishness and emotional stuntedness (covert and malignant narcs) but i'm ngl, the missed treatment of Autism and ADHD really ticks me off.  I also recall them making mention of the ADHD thing years ago and something was stated like ""We didn't want you on Ritalin because you wouldn't be able to join the military""..... Like my path was already carved out so the Gov't could straighten me out because they didn't want to do the emotional labor.

I really wish I could find reasons to not  hate my parent's cause I don't want to that poison to fester in me.  But at the same time it's hard to not look at them both and realize that both of my grandmothers were right, they shouldn't have gotten married nor procreated.... 

If you have little ones do right by them, even if its expensive... you're raising a future adult not a perpetual infant... One day they'll have to go out into the world, and the more tools they have the better.

Sorry to rant, but I'm just over finding out how much I was neglected emotionally, developmentally, and in other ways growing up... it's hard to talk about because so many people don't want to realize some parents are just awful or ""You turned out alright..."".

1m2c000,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1m2c000/best_affordable_silicone_grease_for_use_in_uk/,Best affordable silicone grease for use in UK superautomatic coffee machines (like Delonghi's),"Hi all,

I'm fixing several Delonghi Magnifica and similar machines and have lost my tube of Molykote 111 silicone grease (the stuff everyone recommends).

What UK safety standards should the replacment grease meet and is there anything other than Molykote 111 that is safe and affordable? I've gone down the rabbit hole of trying to understand this and am just more confused. I've found the following safety standards: 

**WRAS**. This is an approval that means the grease is safe for direct contact with hot & cold water in plumbing systems.  Artic Hayes & Regis brand silicone greases are available in this category and are very cheap - Arctic Hayes grease is £30 for a 0.5kg tub at Screwfix/toolstation/City Plumbing and Regis grease is £10 for a small 100ml tube @ Wolsely / City Plumbing.

**NSF H1** \- this is an approval found on some silicone greases e.g. New Tech Lubes Food Safe White Grease - £7.40 for 380ml @ Cromwells, but it is only rated safe for ""incidental"" (not direct) food contact (so I've ruled this out). Ambersil Silicone Grease is 400g for £35 at RS-Online and it's also ""high temperature"" rated (plus NSF H1) but it contains PTFE which I'm less keen on. Loctite Silicone Grease is 400g @ RS for £32 but it's also only rated suitable for ""incidental"" food contact.

**NSF 51, NSF 61 & WRAS approved -** Molykote 111 is the only grease I've found that meets THREE approvals (WRAS as above, but also NSF 51 & NSF 61). Should I just bite the bullet and get some more of this stuff? It's £15 for 100g @ BSE or Cromwells, or £100-ish for 1kg (a life time supply)!

Any views on this? Any reputable brands I've missed? Thanks!!",1,1752769378.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False
1m2bzwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1m2bzwi/update_my_family_and_i_30f_think_my_cousin_28f/,UPDATE - My family and I (30F) think my cousin (28F) might be faking her pregnancy. What can we do?,"About a month ago I posted here asking for advice regarding my cousin W and some concerning behaviors my family had noticed. You can look at it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/alMOR0U8gy) for the details. 

I didn't address all of the questions in the comments but I did want to clear up a few things: 

- ""If you aren't close to W, why are you getting involved?""

I wasn't completely forthcoming with W & I's ages & backstory for privacies sake; we're actually both the same age, born a few weeks apart. Girls are really rare in my family so when we were younger we were raised together in my hometown (we come from a big ass country family) before I moved 300+ miles away. 

My mother and I visited in the summer until I entered high school, and W was (& is still) very close with her. W and I spent time together too, but there was always a bit of a disconnect between us due to interests and distance. To her, I was the only female family member her age to do all the feminine things she didn't get to do with her brother during the school year (manicures, playing dress up, etc); to me, summertime in the country was my opportunity to roll around in the dirt, bike to the river and let me hair turn into a rats nest. My mom was always happy to do that kind of stuff with W when I would refuse, and that's how they bonded. 

With my mom living across the country now, she's effectively been asking me to help check up on W in her stead. 

- ""How do you know she doesn't have the money for IVF?"" 

A month or so before her pregnancy announcement, she had to downsize her apartment and traded in her car for one that had a lower monthly payment and told her sisters that it was becoming too expensive on just her income alone. She also mentioned that she hardly had any savings at the time, because she paid off her student loans in one lump sum. 

- What about her mom/dad? How are you the 'only closely aged girl in the family' if she has sisters?

It's kind of complicated -- W & her sisters have different moms, and they have a pretty significant age gap between the siblings (W has a brother close in age, but the rest of her brothers and sisters are minimum 20 years older than W); furthermore W's mom has suffered from major medical issues for awhile so W's maternal grandparent (who is very old now) was her primary guardian growing up. 

W's dad (my great uncle) passed away over twenty years ago; my mom was his niece. So technically we're first cousins once removed.

-------------

Hope that answers some questions. As far as the update itself goes, there's still a LOT happening but here's the main bits. 

As per the advice I got from commenters here, I reached out to the host of the baby shower (F), who is a friend of W's, and asked if we could meet up so I could give her a gift basket for W. 

We met at a coffee place, exchanged pleasantries, etc, before I shared my concerns about W. I reassured F that I just wanted to make sure W was okay, and that if her reticence towards us was due to some fault on our end, I would back off. F looked really uncomfortable while I was asking all of this, and made me promise that I wouldn't tell W where I got this information from before she started showing me her & W's text messages.

In a nutshell, the baby is real; W had a ONS with an older guy (G) who's in a managerial position at her job and she got pregnant. He's in a different department than her, but the two departments basically share the same office space. 

Initially G didn't want anything to do with the baby, and W agreed that she'd raise it alone; however, I guess he ended up talking to his mom (M) about it and she began pressuring him to get involved. G's a widower with no children, so it seems M feels like this will be her only opportunity to have a grandchild. 

The few ultrasound pictures W gave G were promptly shared all over social media by M, effectively doxxing her. M and some of her friends started messaging and pressuring W to enter a real relationship with her son, so that 'M's only grandchild wouldn't be born a bastard'. Additionally, M started showing up every other day to their office to have lunch with G, but would use the opportunity to continue to pressure W for more information about her pregnancy. W didn't go to HR because she was afraid that she'd lose her job for improper fraternization. 

So W basically went ghost on social media to keep M from stealing her pictures/harassing her, and refused to let her sisters show up for lunch, because she didn't want them to run into M. She's feeling very ashamed of how this is all playing out and doesn't want her sisters to escalate the situation (which to be fair, is a genuine concern -- her sisters are former college basketball players and are NOT afraid to throw hands). 

G is very lukewarm on the whole thing; he doesn't want to be an active dad but wants W to put him on the birth certificate so that his family (AKA M) can have access to the baby. He's willing to pay child support, but W doesn't trust M to respect her boundaries. The dude pretty much only reaches out to W when M tells him to. 

The baby shower(s) was kind of the last straw between W & G -- the first shower was going to be for W's family and friends, while the second was for G's family. F, who used to be W's coworker, agreed to host it at her condo. 

G asked if he could drop off a gift before the party started and W agreed, so long as he left before her guests arrived. So naturally, he arrives 20 minutes into the event with M and some of her friends in tow, fully expecting to be greeted and treated like honored guests. 

F and some of the other guests got into a extended screaming match with M & her friends; it was during this fight that W's sisters started calling, because they couldn't find the correct condo. W blocked them because she didn't want them to show up and escalate the fight. It was mortifying for W because none of her friends/coworkers except for F knew about the full situation, so that cat was now out of the bag. 

The second baby shower still happened, but without W, lol. M basically threw it for herself 200 miles away, and has now been saying that she's going to fight for full custody of the baby. G is continuing to be the definition of milquetoast about his mother's escalating threats and effectively spent the last few months at work ignoring W unless absolutely necessary. 

All of that was dropped on me on a Thursday morning at 8am. 

F had plenty of text messages and screenshots W had sent them over the last 7 months corroborating her story (W keeps M muted so she can keep collecting evidence to use against her). In several of them, W expressed feeling too embarrassed about the whole thing to talk to our family about it. 

A day or two later, W called me -- I had put my number in a card in the gift basket and told her that I was always here to just listen in case she felt alone or sad or angry, and that she could never disappoint me, because she's my cousin and I love her. She thanked me for the gift and we kind of tiptoed around the conversation for a while: she'd say something like ""yeah, I'm doing ok, all things considered"" and I'd respond ""that's great W, I know that things haven't been the easiest lately."" 

Eventually she broached the topic of G and I initially pretended I didn't know anything about it, just so she could get it off her chest. We spent 5 hours on the phone talking about everything that happened and what she should do moving forward. 

I showed W my original post and reading that my mom thought she might try to kidnap a baby made W laugh so hard she snorted, which honestly made my heart feel so much lighter. I also confessed that F told me about everything in advance, but only because we were all so worried about her. 

I suggested that W call my mom and talk to her about everything; I reminded W that she raised my brother and I as a single mom too, and might have some advice to give about the legal side of things. My mom eventually shot me a message a few days later saying that W called and talked to her about the situation.

With all of that being said, W had her baby this week! Both mom and baby are healthy and heading home soon; W has her sisters with her in the hospital and finally told them the full story. They are (predictably) ready to pop the trunk on M, but first and foremost they're helping W look into what legal options she has to protect her baby from M. She hasn't told G about the birth yet but M has been blowing her phone up because she knows W is due around this time. 

She has a very generous maternity leave, but afterwards W's considering leaving that job because of G. I think she should still report it to HR, but one step at a time.

W gave me permission to post this update but past that, I won't be updating anymore about W's situation. I really appreciate all of the advice from my original thread; all I wanted was to make sure my cousin has the support she needs and I feel like we're on the right track to being able to help her now!

Tldr; baby is real, cousin was dealing with baby daddy tomfoolery, the family is in the know now and we're helping to support her however she needs. ",39,1752769372.0,relationship_advice,9,0.9,False
