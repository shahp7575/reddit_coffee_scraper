1l1glih,https://www.reddit.com/r/omad/comments/1l1glih/how_to_stop/,HOW TO STOP?,"I'm currently on Mounjaro and have been eating only once a day at 5.30pm for 4 months

I have coffee in the morning, protein shake for lunch and a 1500 calorie meal for dinner.

Plus loads of supplements and vitamins 

I've been losing about 1kgs a week consistently 

I'm going to hit my target weight of 80 kilos soon so how do I stop the weight loss?

I've got used to the OMAD diet and I'm worried that I'll have to force myself to eat so I don't lose anymore weight 

I'm a little concerned that I'm developing an eating disorder as my love of food is not a priority for me anymore

I know obviously I'm on medication but it seems the dramatic change in my eating habits has become a lifestyle choice.

Has anyone else had any similar experiences or thoughts?

1l1ggmi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l1ggmi,Struggling to stay positive,"Hi Everyone, 
I am feeling demoralized by what I am perceiving as a lack of ""good enough"" progress. 

My starting stats: 65 inches - 164.6 lbs on 28April 
I was tracking here (and have been tracking for ages, previously using cronometer) with macros around 1800 cal, 150 protein, 60 fat, and 165 carbs. 

I started macrofactor and, as expected, I lost a decent chunk of water weight in the first two weeks putting me around 159/158 lbs. However, three weeks later I'm still 158 lbs despite constant reductions in calories. I track everything with my food scale, oil, coffee creamer, veggies, etc. (the blank days in my screenshots are from vacations where I was still mindful but unable to track). 

I have just finished an 8 week 4x/week upper/lower lifting routine and am about to start a new 3x/week full body routine. I use rowing for cardio 3-4x/week and I average between 7-10k steps a day, I dont drink alcohol and consume very little soda/non-water beverages. 

Last week my calories dropped to 1467 and then this week it told me to decrease to 1350 which I declined because I'm already feeling a little sluggish in the gym. Should I just push through? 

I'm feeling stumped. I am thinking maybe my body is going through a recomposition or maybe I've been impatient? I am going to start training for a Marathon in August and wanted to be finished with my cut by then (my original predicted end date was mid July :( but it no longer feels possible since it doesn't feel like anything is moving). 

I am going to keep going, I'm just hoping for some words of encouragement or advice. 

Thank you :) ",2,1748866476.0,MacroFactor,1,1.0,False
1l1gg9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l1gg9z/i_began_binge_eating_and_its_making_me_feel/,I began binge eating and its making me feel horrible,"So over the past 2 years I‚Äôve lost about 100 pounds going from 230 to 130 and i am so proud of myself, like it genuinely amazes me how i basically lost almost half of myself. Now just because i lost all the weight doesn‚Äôt mean i did it correctly, i didn‚Äôt have a well planned strength training routine so i lost quite alot of muscle and now I‚Äôm in an awkward skinny fat phase. Because I‚Äôm quite skinny but have a bit of fat to lose i decided to change my mindset of losing weight to maintaining while recomposing my body by building muscle and losing fat. My body recomposition was going great for months with my diet being a good 80/20 split of healthy foods to foods that i enjoy, life was great and i felt amazing. 2025 so far has had to be the most stressful my life has ever been which i think is a contributing factor to my binging, i turned 16, take college level classes while being a sophomore, go to the gym, trying to be as dialed in as possible on my diet, I‚Äôm apart of a mariachi band in school and outside of school with the one outside of school having rehearsals up until 9pm and the one in school having performances every now and then, and then trying to keep a positive attitude most of the time while being mentally and physically drained. Safe to say i have been really busy but to be honest i enjoy having to be on my feet 24/7 because it means theres never a dull moment and when i do have days to do absolutely nothing it feels earned and makes it so much better. One day in April i had to finish an essay and i stayed up until 4am to finish it. After finishing it i was really hungry and decided to eat all of my calories for the day (i sometimes do OMAD or one meal a day when i feel really hungry because of my massive appetite). While fasting for the rest of the day my parents asked the question that i was dreading because of how much of a willpower struggle it would be, ‚Äúdo you want something to eat?‚Äù i originally said no but i gave up and said to myself ‚Äúyou know what, a grilled chicken sandwich from whataburger and a diet coke isnt going to ruin my progress. My parents then came home with my sandwich and some pupusas with fried chicken. I ended up eating the sandwich, 4 pupusas and probably 10 chicken tenders. I don‚Äôt know why but i ended telling myself ‚Äúyou know what im going to eat everything in the pantry‚Äù and i ate an entire box of hostess coffee cakes. I felt horrible, i was hot, my heart was racing probably because i keep my added sugar intake quite low, below 30 grams most days and that day i probably ate upwards of 200+ and i was so beyond the point of full that i felt like throwing up. I woke up the next morning and felt horrible but not surprisingly i looked in the mirror and saw 0 change in how i looked, and i knew i wasn‚Äôt just gonna gain 10 pounds of fat in a day, so i got right back on track with my normal diet, until a week later i ended up binging again, and then got back on track for a week, and binged again. This cycle has been going on for the past 2 months and if you ever lost a lot of weight you know your biggest fear is gaining the weight back, and this fear is becoming my reality. I‚Äôve been binging all week and i looked in the mirror and my pretty sharp jawline that i had just a couple months ago is half gone, every time i walk i now feel a little jiggle in my stomach, and the loose skin on my stomach that i once saw as an achievement after losing so much weight has filled up with fat that i can actually grab when normally (i know this is going to sound weird) im able to stretch it out in front of me and catch water in it in the shower. i feel horrible and i know i can get back on track and lose this fat but after a week or so i just end up binging again, its not even like im punishing myself for binging with endless amounts of cardio and massive calorie deficits, i put myself in a 500 calorie deficit and then a couple weeks later i just let my massive appetite get the better of me. I feel its quite ironic how i never had a eating disorder before when i was extremely overweight, i was just eating too much, but now that im at a healthy weight i begin to binge, is it because of all the stress going on in my life right now? I have no idea but this summer im going to accept that what i have done is in the past and lighten the load by telling myself that i was just bulking, because i have been lifting for the past 2 months and made a lot of progress, and now im gonna cut down and get back in shape.",2,1748866448.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Welcome to another new week in the $ATYR story‚Äîone that could prove decisive.

We‚Äôre coming off the back of one of the strongest price and volume weeks this stock has had in months. The momentum isn‚Äôt just technical. It‚Äôs structural. And in my view, we‚Äôre entering a period of maximum tension‚Äîwhere everything we‚Äôve been tracking starts to compress.

This week marks a potential turning point for aTyr Pharma ($ATYR), for several reasons:
- On **Thursday, June 5th**, the company will present at the **Jefferies Global Healthcare Conference**, arguably the most important investor event on the Q2 calendar.
- We‚Äôre also **deep into the Phase 2 SSC-ILD readout window**‚Äîand many of the institutional cues suggest that news could be imminent.
- Structurally, we‚Äôre seeing a highly asymmetric setup across **institutional ownership**, **short interest**, and **options positioning**.
- And behaviorally, the market is starting to smell that something‚Äôs building.

Before we dive into the full setup, I want to quickly flag something I‚Äôve been working on.

Later this week, I‚Äôll be publishing a new **deep-dive statistical piece** analysing how biotech stocks behave around pivotal Phase 3 readouts. It‚Äôs based on years of historical data, dozens of tickers, and a forensic look at price behaviour, positioning, and pattern recognition. I think it‚Äôll add real context to where we are now in the $ATYR timeline.

If you‚Äôre new here, I invite you to browse through the rest of my posts. There‚Äôs a lot of research already live.  
And if you‚Äôve been reading quietly, checking in, lurking between posts‚ÄîI see you in the engagement data. I know there are a lot of you. We are one of the fastest growing Reddit finance communities.

If you‚Äôve been getting value out of this work, **please consider showing support**. Just a little goes a long way. It means that when you open Reddit, you‚Äôll keep finding these kinds of posts. And it powers me to keep doing this‚Äîevery day.

I don‚Äôt have a research team or a fund behind me. Just conviction, curiosity, and a drive to build public-facing tools that are actually useful.

Enough of that. Now, let‚Äôs get into it.

## The Setup Coming Into This Week

We‚Äôre no longer in the early accumulation phase. This is setup under compression. Institutional ownership, short exposure, options structure, and technical price action are all converging into a zone that, historically, precedes sharp repricing‚Äîespecially in undercovered biotech names with upcoming binary catalysts.

Here‚Äôs how the market looks heading into the week:

---

### 1. Institutional Ownership ‚Äì Now in Firm Hands

The latest filings show 125 institutional holders, with ownership exceeding 62 million shares‚Äîroughly 69.7% of the total float. These are not passive index trackers. The largest positions are held by:
- Federated Hermes  
- FMR (Fidelity)  
- Vanguard  
- Octagon Capital  
- UBS  
- Susquehanna  
- BlackRock

This is a mix of long-only conviction funds, biotech specialists, and large asset managers. It‚Äôs not cosmetic ownership‚Äîit‚Äôs strategic, with very little apparent churn.

What stands out is that a number of these holders are generalist institutions that typically don‚Äôt lead in speculative biotech. Their presence here suggests a growing recognition that aTyr may be entering a new phase of platform visibility.

We‚Äôre well past the point of ‚Äúearly interest,‚Äù but we‚Äôve yet to see broad recognition. That gap is the opportunity.

---

### 2. Short Interest ‚Äì Structurally Exposed

Short interest has climbed to 12.7 million shares, representing 14.58% of float, with 6.67 days to cover‚Äîa meaningful metric in a low-float name ahead of clinical catalysts.

Despite that, the borrow rate remains low (0.38%), and nearly 35% of short volume is occurring off exchange. The short side appears comfortable, even complacent. I think that‚Äôs notable.

There‚Äôs minimal evidence of hedging activity, no panic rotation in borrow rates, and no visible covering. In a setup like this, that‚Äôs not a show of strength‚Äîit‚Äôs latent risk.

If a catalyst hits while this structure is in place, the path to neutralisation is narrow. There‚Äôs limited liquidity to absorb it, especially with long-only funds sitting tight, convicted retail, and a heavily asymmetric options structure layered on top.

It‚Äôs not a meme-stock short squeeze scenario. It feels more fragile than that.

---

### 3. Options Positioning ‚Äì Asymmetric and Intentional

The options chain is pointing to a deliberate setup. Based on current data, we‚Äôre seeing:
- Implied volatility exceeding 500‚Äì600% across select June, July, and January 2026 call strikes  
- Open interest concentrated around $2.50, $5.00, and $7.50  
- January 2026 calls now exceed 6,000 contracts open‚Äîunusually high for a company with no marketed product

There is very limited put interest‚Äîalmost no downside protection. This isn‚Äôt balanced positioning. It‚Äôs a directional structure built around low-cost convexity.

In my view, this reflects institutional hedging for an upside trigger, not retail gambling. It‚Äôs structured optionality‚Äîpaying very little for potential revaluation if a major catalyst (like SSC-ILD) confirms platform value.

This sort of asymmetry often tends to precede reflexive moves when news hits.

---

### 4. Technical Structure ‚Äì Staged, Not Chased

Technically, the stock has built a base over multiple weeks. The pattern is very clear:
- Higher lows on the hourly and daily charts  
- Volume spikes on accumulation, not on breakouts  
- Rapid absorption of intraday weakness  
- Evidence of iceberg bids and staggered support layering

There‚Äôs very little overhead supply in the tape, and the move up hasn‚Äôt been impulsive. It looks deliberate‚Äîsuggesting that larger holders are content to build quietly rather than trigger a run before the next catalyst.

This kind of structure often ends not with a gradual breakout, but with a sudden repricing‚Äîtypically triggered by a defined external event. And that event window might now be opening.

---

## This Week‚Äôs Events

### Jefferies Global Healthcare Conference ‚Äì Wednesday, June 5 @ 2:00 PM EDT  
‚Üí [**Register to stream it here**](https://wsw.com/webcast/jeff319/register.aspx?conf=jeff319&page=atyr&url=https://wsw.com/webcast/jeff319/atyr/1878784)

This is the headline event of the week‚Äîand arguably the most consequential conference of the quarter for healthcare investors.

Jefferies isn‚Äôt just another investment forum. It‚Äôs the institutional anchor of the midyear healthcare calendar. Getting a slot at Jefferies‚Äîparticularly a mid-afternoon, mid-week placement‚Äîisn‚Äôt random. It typically reflects a company with:
- A pending or recent catalyst of note  
- Existing interest from large-cap pharma and crossover funds  
- A desire (or need) to engage syndicate desks, bankers, or institutional allocators

The audience is broad and sophisticated. It will include:
- Portfolio managers from specialist healthcare funds  
- Strategy teams from large-cap biopharma  
- Sell-side analysts looking to initiate or update coverage  
- Syndicate desks scouting for potential offerings or M&A flow

And unlike closed-door firesides or bank-curated one-on-ones, Jefferies is very much a public-facing event. That means everything said is on the record. Every signal matters‚Äîcontent, tone, delivery, posture, confidence.

I will, of course, undertake a full and comprehensive deep-dive analysis. 

If SSC-ILD data is out, this becomes aTyr‚Äôs first major opportunity to articulate the result publicly. It‚Äôs a chance to:
- Frame the implications for the NRP2 platform  
- Reassert the potential for inflammation resolution across multiple ILDs  
- Establish a forward-looking commercial or BD narrative (licensing, co-dev, or M&A)

If the data hasn‚Äôt dropped yet, the tone and body language will be under the microscope. Avoidance or hedging will stand out. In contrast, confidence and clarity‚Äîeven without specifics‚Äîcan signal readiness.

Either way, this isn‚Äôt just a company appearance. It‚Äôs a signal to the market: we‚Äôre here, we‚Äôre on radar, and we know what‚Äôs coming.

---

### SSC-ILD Phase 2 Readout ‚Äì The Most Underappreciated Catalyst in the Setup

This is the moment that could turn $ATYR from a single-indication story into a validated immunology platform.

**What‚Äôs being tested:**
- Efzofitimod‚Äôs anti-inflammatory activity in systemic sclerosis-associated ILD (SSC-ILD), a separate and more autoimmune-driven disease than sarcoidosis  
- Whether NRP2 modulation produces inflammation-resolving macrophage phenotypes across multiple ILDs  
- Whether aTyr‚Äôs tRNA synthetase platform can extend beyond pulmonary sarcoidosis to harder-to-treat autoimmune conditions  
- Whether regulators and partners see this as a class-defining mechanism‚Äînot just a molecule

**Why this matters:**
- SSC-ILD is not only more severe but also under-served by current therapies. If efzofitimod works here, the implication is platform-scale anti-inflammatory potential‚Äîwith differentiated biology from anything else in the space.  
- It would triangulate clinical, mechanistic, and translational evidence: from animal models and immunology papers to human signals in two distinct ILDs.  
- It would significantly improve the company‚Äôs strategic leverage‚Äîfor partnering, pricing power, or potential M&A interest.

In short, this readout isn‚Äôt just about efficacy in one more disease. It‚Äôs about de-risking a platform, accelerating institutional conviction, and making the science real in the eyes of the Street.

**Timing:**  
The company has consistently guided to Q2 2025. Based on cumulative signals‚Äîconference cadence (Piper, Evercore, Jefferies), sudden IR engagement, and post-ATS momentum‚Äîit‚Äôs clear that we‚Äôre now deep in the event window.

My view is unchanged from earlier: while there‚Äôs a real chance the data lands this week, it‚Äôs not guaranteed. The more likely window‚Äîbased on cadence norms and institutional coordination‚Äîruns through to June 10, with the highest odds still sitting in that June 3‚Äì7 range, right around Jefferies.

It‚Äôs also worth noting: aTyr has shown no sign of last-minute scrambling. That suggests the data is either in hand or close to it‚Äîand what we‚Äôre seeing now is the carefully sequenced messaging around its release.

## Strategic Context: 5 Read-Throughs That Matter Now

This section is about structural signals‚Äîwhat they mean when viewed together, and how institutional players might be interpreting them before the Street catches up.

---

### 1. Institutional Positioning Looks Like Pre-Validation Stakebuilding

We now have verified ownership of over 62 million shares (69.7% of the float) across 125 institutional holders, including names like FMR, Federated Hermes, Vanguard, Octagon, BlackRock, and UBS.

This isn‚Äôt passive ownership.

Many of these firms have added meaningfully over Q1, with more than 6 million net new shares acquired, representing an 11% quarterly increase. This isn‚Äôt typical for a company with no sell-side coverage, no commercial product, and no recent financing.

In my view, this has all the hallmarks of stakebuilding ahead of a platform confirmation event‚Äînot a valuation play on a single trial.

---

### 2. Market Valuation Reflects Obscurity, Not Potential

Despite holding multiple Orphan and Fast Track designations, publishing in Science Translational Medicine, and advancing into global Phase 3, $ATYR still has minimal media visibility.

Meanwhile, the float is over two-thirds institutionally held. That‚Äôs not apathy‚Äîit‚Äôs a mismatch between ownership structure and market recognition.

The way I see it, the market is currently valuing $ATYR as though it‚Äôs still speculative. But the participants inside the float aren‚Äôt behaving that way. That discrepancy creates setup risk‚Äîon the upside.

---

### 3. Options Behavior Is Telling You This Isn‚Äôt a Retail Setup

As of the latest data:
- IV on June, July, and Jan 2026 calls sits between 500‚Äì600%  
- The $2.50, $5.00, and $7.50 call strikes have thousands of open contracts  
- January 2026 calls alone now exceed 6,000 contracts‚Äîrare for a pre-commercial biotech

And notably, there‚Äôs almost no matching put volume.

To me, that suggests that funds (not traders) are positioning around a binary inflection point‚Äînot because they know the direction, but because they see a mispriced event window with asymmetric upside.

This is typical of what we might see before binary readouts in names that haven‚Äôt yet caught broader attention.

---

### 4. Borrow Cost Is Inconsistent with the Event Profile

The short borrow rate remains around 0.38%, even with:
- 12.7M shares short  
- 14.58% of float  
- 6.67 days to cover  
- ~35% of volume occurring off-exchange

This isn‚Äôt a lightly shorted name anymore‚Äîbut the borrow mechanics haven‚Äôt caught up.

What that tells me is that short positioning hasn‚Äôt been repriced since options skew spiked, volume returned, and Jefferies confirmed participation. That lag creates fragility‚Äîespecially when the float is tight and the news window is wide open.

If the readout is clean, shorts will likely need to cover into an increasingly illiquid environment. That‚Äôs not a squeeze thesis‚Äîit‚Äôs just structural risk, plain and simple, black and white.

---

### 5. Institutional Silence Might Not Mean Disinterest

There‚Äôs been very little noise from the usual sources‚Äîno major sell-side notes, no significant price target chatter, no buy/sell calls on social.

But inside the float, things are moving.

In my experience, this kind of silence isn‚Äôt passive‚Äîit‚Äôs deliberate quiet. Institutions that already hold size tend to stay quiet ahead of potential validation events. Then, if and when the data lands clean, they move again‚Äîoften adding, not just holding.

This is how rerates begin in names like $ATYR‚Äînot with a surge in retail flow, but with existing holders doubling up and visibility expanding post-catalyst.

---

## Final Thought

We‚Äôre coming into a week that sits at the intersection of structure, narrative, and timing.

You‚Äôve got:
- A float that‚Äôs already tightly held by long-only institutions  
- A short book that hasn‚Äôt been repriced for the risk  
- A volatility structure building around very specific strikes and expiries  
- A major investor event mid-week  
- And a clinical catalyst that‚Äîif clean‚Äîcould shift the whole trajectory of how this company is seen

Whether that catalyst lands this week or next, we‚Äôre now inside the window. Structurally, sentiment-wise, and event-wise, we‚Äôre in that phase where things tend to change‚Äînot gradually, but all at once.

1l1g919,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalianGreyhounds/comments/1l1g919/experienced_ig_owner_as_a_couple_needs_confidence/,Experienced IG owner as a couple needs confidence as a single,"With my husband, I've owned 4 purebred IGs and an IG mix over 25 years. My husband passed away a year & a half ago, and after that, my two older IGs, which were the only ones we had then, passed away within another year (both 12). We never had kids, so our dogs were our family. As you can imagine, it's been heartbreaking for me--my entire family--my husband and both dogs--gone within a year and a half. I adore IGs, the only dog like them, as you all know, and life without one would be unbearable now. So 9 months ago, I adopted an IG mix (with chihuaha, but with an IG cuddly sweet personality). She lived the first 6 months with the last of my IGs, who died earlier this year. She's been needy and a handful since, so I decided to get a second dog, this one a 12-week-old purebred IG puppy, just picked up from the breeder two days ago. Two of my previous IGs were young puppies, but that was many years ago now, and I'd forgotten how hard it is--also, my husband was there to help back then, and now I'm alone. So I'm now lacking confidence--I know this breed, but it's so much harder by myself. I work part time (only 20 hours per week), and with the two dogs having each other when I'm gone, knew it would still be possible to do this. Also, we always had an indoor potty system (potty pads or newspapers) that worked fine for us for many years. My new little boy, however, was kennel raised and had lots of outdoor time, so he thinks he can pee anywhere. The first day, I caught him in the act every time, but that was still at least 5 times, anywhere he chose. Put him on some potty pads each time, but since he was basically just finishing when I caught him, he had nothing left, so did nothing on the pads (note--the IG mix is completely potty trained to pads). I'm going to try natural grass on a tray indoors, because he easily goes on grass--just doesn't hold it inside. Hoping this will work. Also, I tried separating the two dogs to put him in a small kitchen, but he bites the gate and tries to squeeze under it to get to the other dog, so it isn't safe to gate him. I've never crated (never had to with all the others, one of us was always home), and the IG mix isn't crated, and given how he acts with just a gate (he's the most velcro of all the velcro IGs I've had), I don't even want to try. The mix needs access to her potty area, which is in a foyer off the living room, so I'm going to try to puppy-safe the living room: The sofa has a ramp the new boy quickly learned to use, and I'm going to block off the areas of the sofa not ramped so neither of them can't jump off the sofa but must use the ramp (sofa is of course against the wall). I'm moving two occasional chairs out of the room to a gated area and moved the coffee table to the side. Hid/unplugged all cords. I'll have to put pads down on the one area in the living room he's repeatedly marked, but if I do all that (the natural grass hasn't arrived yet), I believe I'll be OK to work four hours a couple days this week. I have one 8 hour day this upcoming Saturday, but I come home from work for 1/2 hour and walk/let out/feed the dogs during lunch break. I typically work two 8-hour days and one 4-hour day per week, and I'm hoping the above will all work out for the new boy (the mix has been OK with it). I'm a little worried about rough play between the two dogs (my IG mix really longed for a playmate, and now their running, tugging, and wrestling a lot), but with the sofa mostly blocked off except for the ramped area, I'm hoping that will prevent any accidents. I've got excellent pet insurance--low deductible, 90% pay--but am praying nothing happens (I had one previous puppy who broke both front legs by jumping off a recliner--my first IG--another who as a rescue puppy came to us with a newly broken but surgically repaired leg). I just am feeling so nervous about doing this alone, but I can't see living out my retirement years all alone without my beloved IGs. My heart's been hurt too much, and IGs are the best dogs ever to heal your heart. I just wish I wasn't so nervous about doing this all alone.",1,1748865829.0,ItalianGreyhounds,0,1.0,False

This coming Saturday I will travel and I plan to go out in public as a cross-dresser for the first time. I have 4 pairs of shoes to chose from, a pair of jeans, a skirt and leggings. I only have one top and I will wear a bra with silicone inserts.

I plan to go to a mall, perhaps have a coffee and then later go to a bar for a few drinks.

First of all, please help me to pick the best combination from the photos.

Secondly, what should I expect? I have a beard and am quite tall so no one will believe I am a woman, even if they have poor eyesight. I have pretty good self confidence, so I don't think I will feel hurt if someone calls me names, but it would obviously be nicer if not.

""He'll spend his birthday with me tonight."" On her husband Wayne Hamilton's birthday, Danica Vance received a text from an unknown woman.

It wasn't the first time.

The woman attached a selfie.

The photo didn't show her face.

Only her bare legs and a used condom could be seen.

Clutching her phone, Danica felt a wave of nausea.

Soon, the woman texted her again.

""You're too old for him. Be sensible and get a divorce.""

Danica grabbed her bag and headed straight to the Nimbus Hotel.

She'd see for herself who that woman was.

Upon reaching the hotel entrance, she saw her mother, Liliana Watson, and her father, Rodney Vance. Stepping forward in surprise, she said, ""Dad, Mom, what are you doing here?""

Liliana and Rodney were stunned. They immediately exchanged a glance and then looked away, not daring to meet Danica's eyes. ""Dani, Jenny's back to the country. We're here to drop her off.""

Jennifer?

Through the dustless floor-to-ceiling windows, Danica saw Jennifer Vance and instantly froze.

The blue-and-white dress Jennifer was wearing was identical to the one in the photo.

So, the woman was her sister Jennifer.

Ever since high school, Jennifer's biggest hobby had been stealing others' boyfriends.

And now, she set her eyes on her brother-in-law.

Danica couldn't help but laugh sarcastically. She turned around to look at Liliana and Rodney and asked, ""You both knew she was hitting on Wayne?""

Rodney pulled an awkward smile. ""Dani, Wayne doesn't love you at all.""

Liliana echoed, ""He's right, Dani. You know women in Marinburg are lining up to be with Wayne, right? Rather than let others take him, why not give Jenny a chance?""

Danica couldn't help but clench her fists. ""Dad, Mom, I'm your daughter, too!""

With that, she turned to leave without hesitation.

Suddenly, Liliana's voice rang out behind her. ""Danica, did Wayne touch you?""

Danica paused.

Rodney said, his words harsh, ""Danica, stop acting like we owe you. Back then, everyone thought Jenny and Wayne were meant to be. We only agreed to let you marry him in Jenny's place after his accident left him in a vegetative state.""

Liliana sized her up with disdain. ""Look at yourself, Danica. Over the past three years, you've been nothing but a housewife. What do you have left without Wayne? But Jenny? She's the lead principal dancer. You're nowhere near as good as her. She's the swan, and you're the ugly duckling. Just get a divorce so that they can finally be together‚Äîthat's what everyone wants to see.""

Her words were like a sharp knife, stabbing Danica's heart ruthlessly. She silently left, her eyes brimming with tears.

\*\*\*

It was already dark when Danica went back to the villa. She had given the maid Kelsey a day off and sat in the darkness alone, not bothering to turn the lights on.

She then sat by the dining table, surrounded by silence and darkness.

The table of dishes had gone cold, and the cake in the middle with the words ""Happy birthday, Honey"" stung her eyes.

The surprises she had prepared and she were nothing but a joke.

In everyone's eyes, Jennifer and Wayne were a golden couple, and they all knew how much Wayne doted on her. Yet, a car accident three years ago left him in a vegetative state. And shortly after that, Jennifer vanished without a trace.

Then the Vance family brought Danica back from the countryside and forced her to marry Wayne in Jennifer's place.

Danica agreed readily after learning her groom was Wayne, the man she had always loved deeply.

After getting married, she took care of him attentively, becoming a full-time housewife who seldom went out or socialized. Finally, he woke up after three years in a vegetative state.

She pulled out a lighter and lit up some candles.

Through the dim light, she saw her own reflection in the mirror‚Äîa housewife in a black-and-white dress forever, dull and rigid.

On the contrary, Jennifer was now the lead principal dancer, the living embodiment of youth, vitality, and beauty.

She was the ugly duckling.

Jennifer was the swan.

Jennifer was still Wayne's choice now that he had awoken.

Only now did she realize the previous three years were nothing but a dream.

Wayne didn't love her, but she loved him deeply.

They said whoever fell in love first was destined to lose. Thanks to Wayne, she lost completely.

She blew out the candles as tears welled up in her eyes.

The villa once again plunged into endless darkness.

Just then, two bright headlights shone into the living room‚Äîit was Wayne's Rolls-Royce Phantom, which soon came to a steady stop next to the lawn.

Danica's eyelashes fluttered slightly. He was back...

She had thought he wouldn't come home tonight.

Soon, the door was opened. As she felt the slightly cool night breeze, a tall, slender figure came into her view. Wayne was home.

The Hamilton family had been top-tier in Marinburg for over a century. As the future heir of the family, Wayne had shown extraordinary business talent since childhood. At the age of sixteen, he obtained a double master's degree from Brenton University. After graduation, he listed his first company in Wilsonville, which expanded rapidly. After he came back to the country, he officially took over the Hamilton Group and became the richest man in Marinburg.

Wayne walked into the dining room and his deep, magnetic voice carried a trace of detachment. ""Why didn't you turn on the lights?""

Then a soft click rang out.

He turned on the wall lamp.

Danica instinctively closed her eyes for a second upon feeling the sudden brightness. When she opened them again, she looked at Wayne.

The custom-tailored black suit he was wearing accentuated his handsome face. His perfect proportions, coupled with his innate icy, noble temperament, made him undoubtedly the Prince Charming of Marinburg's socialites.

Danica looked at him. ""Today's your birthday.""

Still expressionless, Wayne lifted his gaze a bit and glanced at the table. ""Don't bother next time. I don't do birthdays.""

Danica curved her lips. ""You don't do birthdays? Or you don't wanna celebrate them with me?""

Hearing this, he glanced at her, but only for a second. Then he quickly averted his gaze, as if not wanting to waste another second on her. ""Whatever you think.""

Then he walked over to the stairs.

He had always been like this when facing her.

There was nothing she could do to win his favor.

She stood up and said while watching his cold retreating figure, ""It's your birthday, so I wanna give you a gift.""

Not stopping or looking back at all, he said, ""That won't be necessary.""

Smiling slowly, she said calmly, ""Wayne, let's get a divorce.""

He had already set one foot on the staircase. At her words, he paused abruptly and then turned around, his deep gaze locking onto her.

**Chapter 2 Let's Get a Divorce**

Danica was looking at him, too. She repeated softly yet firmly, ""Let's get a divorce, Wayne. Do you like this birthday gift?""

Wayne said expressionlessly, ""Are you making a scene because I didn't come back for the birthday?""

She smiled, ""Jennifer's back, right?""

Hearing Jennifer's name, Wayne scoffed coldly.

He walked toward Danica step by step. ""Does that bother you?""

He was the youngest titan of the business world, carrying an overwhelming presence, which was the result of power, status, and wealth. As he approached Danica, she instinctively took a step back.

In the next second, the icy chill of the wall seeped through her clothes as she realized she had nowhere to retreat.

Just then, Wayne's shadow engulfed her as he propped one hand against the wall behind her, sealing her in with his broad chest.

Wayne looked down at her, sneering, ""Everyone in Marinburg knew Jennifer was the one I was supposed to marry. Didn't you know that when you went all out to marry me in her place? If you weren't bothered back then, why are you making a fuss right now?""

Danica's face turned pale.

He was right. Jennifer was supposed to marry him.

She would never have had a chance to be his wife if it weren't for that accident.

She'd never forget the undisguised disappointment and coldness in his eyes the day he woke up from the coma and saw her.

They had slept in separate rooms since their marriage, and he had never touched her.

She knew very well that Wayne loved Jennifer.

But...

She gazed at his handsome face, which gradually overlapped with that of the youthful boy from her childhood, and thought, ""Wayne, you really don't remember me?

""It seems I'm the only one who's stuck in the past.

""Forget it.

""I've loved you for years. It's time to let our three-year marriage mark the ending of my love for you.""

Suppressing the bitterness and pain in her heart, she said, ""Wayne, let's end this sexless marriage.""

Hearing this, Wayne arched an eyebrow and repeated, ""Sexless marriage?""

He lifted his hand, pinched her delicate chin, and pressed against her rosy lips with his thumb, saying suggestively, ""So, that's why you want a divorce. Are you that horny?""

A rosy hue spread across Danica's cheeks instantly.

That wasn't what she meant!

As he exerted more force to press and rub her lips, she was stunned‚Äîit had never occurred to her that such a handsome, refined man could be this frivolous.

He was actually playing her lips with his thumb.

It was the first time Wayne had looked at Danica at such a close distance. She wore a black-and-white dress and a pair of oversized, black-framed glasses all year long, looking no different from an aged woman.

It was only now that he noticed her palm-sized face, her breathtakingly beautiful features, as well as her crystal-clear, doe-like eyes hidden behind those glasses.

She had soft lips.

The spot where his thumb pressed would appear bloodless, but once he unpressed it, it'd bounce back and seem even more rosy.

Somehow, he found the urge to kiss her.

His gaze deepened as he said, ""I'm surprised, Mrs. Hamilton. It turns out you're so desperate for sex.""

Immediately, a loud smack rang out.

Danica slapped across his face.

Apparently, she had exerted great force‚Äîhis face tilted to the side.

Furious, Danica trembled all over, thinking, ""How dare he humiliate me like this! Sure enough, loving too humbly breeds only self-degradation.""

She snapped, feeling both humiliated and furious, ""I know you still can't get over Jennifer all these years. I'll step out of your way so that you can marry the woman you truly love.""

Wayne's expression darkened immediately. From the day he was born, he had always been treated with utmost respect. No one had ever dared to disrespect him, let alone slap him.

He looked at her, his gaze piercing. ""Danica, you married me because you wanted to, and now, you're divorcing me because you feel like it? What do you take me for?""

Danica chuckled. ""A toy.""

What?

Her answer left Wayne stunned.

Swallowing her bitterness, she said with a sneer, ""That's right, you heard me. You're just a toy I snatched from Jennifer. And now, I'm fed up with you and no longer want you.""

Wayne squinted dangerously. ""Good for you, Danica. You want a divorce? Fine. You have it. You better not come crying to me to get back together.""

With that, he went upstairs and entered the study, slamming the door so hard that a deafening sound echoed in the villa.

Danica slowly slid down the wall, feeling utterly exhausted.

Crouching on the carpet, she wrapped her arms around her frail body. ""Wayne,"" she muttered, ""I won't love you anymore.""

\*\*\*

Early the next morning.

Kelsey pushed open the door to the study and walked inside.

Wayne, a well-recognized workaholic, was reviewing documents in his chair.

Kelsey called out to him, ""Mr. Hamilton.""

He didn't even lift his head. Apparently, he was in a foul mood. Even the air around him was freezing.

Seeing this, Kelsey cautiously put a cup of coffee on the desk. ""Mr. Hamilton, Mrs. Hamilton brewed this for you.""

His hand holding the pen paused as his expression softened a little.

He thought, ""Is this some peace offering?

""No matter what, it's undeniable that Danica is a perfect wife. She cooks according to my liking, hand-washes my clothes, and takes care of all my daily needs attentively.""

He picked up the coffee and took a sip.

Yes, it was indeed the coffee she brewed. It was his favorite kind.

But he was still mad.

She had slapped him last night, and of course, he wouldn't let her off that easily.

To earn his forgiveness would take more than just a cup of coffee.

He asked, ""Has she owned up to her mistake?""

Kelsey gave him a strange look. ""Mr. Hamilton, Mrs. Hamilton left.""

Stunned, he looked up at Kelsey.

She handed him a piece of paper. ""She left with a suitcase. And she asked me to give this to you before she walked out of the door.""

Wayne took the paper over and unfolded it. In the next second, the words ""Divorce Agreement"" came into his view.

He was stunned‚Äîso, the coffee wasn't some peace offering at all.

Just then, Kelsey said, ""Mr. Hamilton, Mrs. Hamilton wanted you to finish the coffee and sign the papers.""

His cold gaze fell upon the coffee. ""Pour it out. I don't want a drop left.""

Kelsey was confused. ""But you enjoyed it, didn't you? How come...""

As she met his glacial eyes, her voice trailed off, and she picked up the coffee and walked out quickly.

Wayne's expression darkened completely. He glanced at the divorce papers, in which Danica stated that she'd leave with nothing willingly.

Sneering, he thought, ""Danica, you're all principles now, huh? You don't want a penny? You came from the countryside. How are you gonna survive?

""You went all out to marry me three years ago all because of money, didn't you?""

Just then, he suddenly squinted because he spotted the reason for the divorce Danica handwrote.

""My husband suffers from sexual dysfunction and fails to fulfill marital duties.""

Wayne pulled an extremely long face.

That damn woman!

Immediately, he took out his phone and called her.

Soon, the call connected. She said, her voice as crisp as ever, ""Hello.""

**Chapter 3 You're Impotent**

Wayne pressed his thin lips into a straight line. ""Danica, get your ass back here. Now!""

Danica smiled, ""Why should I? Just because you want me to? Wayne, we're divorced. I don't have to take orders from you anymore.""

Wayne said through gritted teeth, ""I'll give you a chance to rewrite the reason for the divorce.""

She smiled even more heartily, ""No need. I didn't say anything wrong, did I? Wayne, it's been six months since you woke up from the coma, but you have never even held my hand once. Though you seem healthy now, you were a vegetable for three years after all, and I have every reason to suspect you're impotent. A piece of friendly advice‚Äîgo and see a skilled doctor as soon as possible. Hope you can 'get back on your feet' soon.""

Wayne said nothing.

He could feel the veins in his forehead throbbing.

How dare she!

""Danica, I swear I'm gonna make you realize how wrong you are sooner or later!""

""Oops, too late. That's not gonna happen.""

""Danica!""

Utterly furious, he was about to lash out when he heard the beeping sounds.

She hung up.

Gnashing his teeth, he snarled, ""Danica!""

\*\*\*

Meanwhile, Danica was in the apartment of Florence Conway, her bestie. Florence chuckled as she hung up and gave her a thumbs-up, saying, ""Kudos, Dani. I bet Wayne is burning with rage right now.""

By now, Danica had already realized her mistake. She used to love Wayne so humbly, which was why he was always so condescending.

But self-worth beat everything.

Women who didn't cherish themselves were bound to be looked down on.

Florence said, ""Jennifer fled after she knew about his accident three years ago. Now that he's awoken, he still wants to be with her? You made the right choice by leaving him, Dani.""

Danica placed a candy in her mouth, hoping the sweetness could dissipate the bitterness in her heart. ""I guess that's the difference between being loved and not being loved.""

Those being loved could act as willfully as they wanted to.

But those who were unloved had to walk on eggshells all day long.

Florence glanced over and noticed Danica had eaten a pile of candies.

She decisively dragged Danica to stand up. ""Chin up, Dani. You've got your freedom back, and that's what's important. You're single now! I'll order eight male escorts to get you a divorce party tonight!""

Danica smiled helplessly.

Florence suddenly reached out, took off Danica's glasses, and tossed them into the bin.

Danica bent over to pick them up. ""My glasses...""

Florence stopped her. ""Dani, you've buried in your research for too long. It's time to get rid of those thick glasses. Think about Jennifer‚Äîyou should also dress up.""

All of a sudden, Liliana's words echoed in Danica's mind‚Äî""She's the swan, and you're the ugly duckling.""

Maybe Wayne thought so, too.

Florence pulled her out of the door. ""Let's go shopping. I'll take you to do your hair and nails and buy you clothes. Let's prove all of them wrong. Wayne will be slack-jawed at seeing how pretty you are!""

She suddenly thought of something. ""Dani, are you sure you don't want his money?""

Danica said, ""I have money.""

""Jennifer will be so thankful to know you've left her with all the money.""

Danica parted her lips but didn't know what to say.

""Where's the card Wayne gave you?"" Florence asked.

Wayne, always generous, had given Danica a premium black card, but she had never used it.

She found it in her bag and blinked playfully. ""Tonight's on Wayne then.""

\*\*\*

Night arrived.

1996 Bar had always been the most popular spot in Marinburg where trust fund kids squandered their money. Tonight, as usual, its dance floor was packed with people, moving in a frenzy to every exaggerated sweep of the DJ's arms.

Under the dim lights, Wayne sat on the main seat of the VIP booth. He was wearing a black shirt and suit pants tonight, with his sleeves rolled up a little, revealing his firm forearms and a seven-figure watch on his wrist. Many women in the bar couldn't even take their eyes off his strikingly handsome face.

The person sitting next to Wayne was Emilio Griffin, the heir of the Griffin family, and they were accompanied by a few other wealthy heirs.

Emilio burst into laughter. ""What did you say, Wayne? Danica wants a divorce?""

The rest laughed, too. ""Everyone knows she's your simp, Wayne. She married you without hesitation when you were in a vegetative state. Why the heck would she leave you now?""

""Let's make a bet on how long before she comes crawling back to Wayne.""

Emilio said, ""I bet she won't even last today. For all we know, she might text Wayne in the next second.""

Wayne, however, pulled a long face. Clearly, he was in a bad mood.

He took out his phone and pulled out his chat interface with Danica on WhatsApp.

Their last conversation happened last night. She sent him a photo of the soup she made and texted him, ""Honey, I know the test results show you've recovered perfectly now, but I still want you to have something more nutritious. I'm waiting for you at home.""

As he scrolled up, he saw nothing but the messages she had sent him.

She texted him every day, but he had never replied to her.

Never.

His phone was exceptionally quiet today because she didn't even text him once.

He felt irritated, though he didn't know why.

Suddenly, his phone dinged.

It was a text.

Emilio immediately said, ""What did I say, guys? I bet it's Danica!""

Before anyone could say anything, Wayne's phone dinged a few more times.

He received several messages in a row.

The men around them couldn't help but laugh. ""We all knew Danica would regret it, but who would have thought she'd give in so quickly?""

Emilio urged, ""Wayne, check them out. Let's see how desperate she is.""

Wayne arched an eyebrow slightly, thinking, ""Did Danica text me after all?

""What's the point of pulling such a stunt then?

""So much for her pride.""

He tapped the screen and was stunned in the next second.

Emilio leaned over and read the text out loud, ""Dear VVIP customer, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 130 dollars at Fancy Nails.""

The rest were puzzled.

As Wayne scrolled up, he saw that Danica had spent 300 dollars at Grace Salon, 14 thousand dollars at the Chanel boutique, and 40 thousand dollars at the Louis Vuitton boutique.

It was never about Danica wanting to get back together with him.

All he received was bank notifications.

No one said a word.

They somehow felt being slapped by her.

With a livid face, Wayne slammed his phone onto the table. He couldn't care less how much Danica had spent. What annoyed him was the fact that she went shopping right after their divorce. Good for her!

Over the past three years, she had done whatever he asked, not complaining once. But suddenly, she became a completely different person.

Emilio said, ""Wayne, what's gotten into Danica? She actually bought new clothes and even got her nails and hair done? Is she trying to copy Jenny's style?""

""Jennifer is the Muse in Marinburg, but she's just a bumpkin from the countryside. No matter how she tries, she's just gonna make a bigger fool of herself.""

""Hasn't she learned? The ugly duckling can never become the swan.""

Everyone was ridiculing Danica.

Suddenly, a commotion drew their attention. They looked over, and someone exclaimed, ""Gosh, am I dreaming? Is that an angel?""

**Chapter 4 Play With Fire**

Danica was here.

After the shopping spree, Florence brought her to 1996 Bar where the divorce party was held.

It had never occurred to Danica that she'd run into Wayne and his lot, and of course, she heard their ridicule.

She knew those men around Wayne. They were all part of the upper class in Marinburg, and Emilio was the closest to Wayne. Back then, everyone in Marinburg had known that Jennifer and Wayne were an item, and these men had all been fond of Jennifer. Emilio even called her ""Jenny"".

Over the past three years, none of them had actually accepted Danica.

To them, she was just ""the substitute bride"", ""the simp"", ""the ugly duckling"", and ""the bumpkin"".

Since Wayne didn't love her, of course, his friends wouldn't treat her with any respect.

Florence heard their conversation, too. Furious, she rolled up her sleeves and was about to charge over. ""I'm gonna beat the crap out of them!""

Danica stopped her. ""Forget it, Florence. I'm divorced already, right? Pay no mind to what they say.""

The calmness on Danica's face seemed genuine, and Florence held back with difficulty. As more and more people turned to look at Danica while addressing her as ""angel"", Florence was instantly in a better mood. ""Let's go, Dani. We're gonna have some serious fun!""

She brought Danica to a VIP booth and waved her hand. ""Get all the male escorts here!""

In another VIP booth, as a few playboys mocked Danica nonstop, they suddenly felt a sharp, cold gaze.

They looked up, only to see Wayne, in the main seat, glance at them lazily.

There was coldness, displeasure, and warning in Wayne's eyes.

The grins on their faces froze, and they fell silent at once, not daring to badmouth Danica anymore.

Meanwhile, Emilio gazed at Wayne, thinking, ""Though Wayne has never taken Danica seriously, she has indeed taken care of him attentively for three years. I guess it means something to him after all.""

Just then, the commotion in the bar grew bigger. ""Such a beautiful angel!""

Angel?

Where?

Emilio looked over and was instantly slack-jawed. ""Fuck me! An angel indeed!""

Those playboys were equally stunned. ""Since when did Marinburg have such a beauty? None of us has ever seen her before.""

Emilio elbowed Wayne. ""Wayne, look! An angel!""

Wayne had been surrounded by all kinds of women since childhood, and he wasn't interested at all. But Danica's booth was right opposite his.

He looked up and saw her.

Without those oversized glasses on her face, she no longer seemed rigid and stiff. Her palm-sized face was fair and tender, and her straight, long hair scattered on her shoulders, coupled with her striking features and cold, indifferent temperament, was indeed worth the word ""angel"".

Wayne paused for a couple of seconds.

Emilio was thrilled. ""What do you think, Wayne? Isn't she an angel or what?""

One of their friends said, ""I bet he's not into her. She has that icy vibe, whereas delicate beauties such as Jennifer are his type.""

""Check out her legs! They're as perfect as Jennifer's.""

Unlike before, Danica was wearing a short skirt, revealing her legs for the first time.

Her legs were long, slender, and nicely toned.

Any man would be captivated by them, which were as impressive as Jennifer's.

Wayne's gaze lingered on the ""angel"" for a few seconds. Somehow, he felt that he had seen her somewhere before.

Just then, several male escorts went to Danica's booth and stood in front of her, each and every one of them had a stunning face and an exceptionally nice figure.

Florence smiled, ""Go ahead, Dani. Pick eight.""

To celebrate that she was finally out of her misery, Danica decided to have some proper fun. ""You... You... And you. Stay.""

Meanwhile, Emilio was counting. ""Gee, did she just pick eight of them?""

One of the playboys teased, ""Why waste money? At her beckon, we'll be more than happy to keep her company without charging a penny.""

Everyone laughed.

Just then, Wayne's phone dinged again.

It was another bank notification.

He picked up his phone to see what Danica had bought this time.

""Dear VVIP customer, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 80 thousand dollars at 1996 Bar for ordering eight male escorts.""

Wayne froze. He read the words ""eight male escorts"" a few times before looking up at ""angel"" sitting opposite him.

It was Danica who had just ordered eight male escorts.

He was slightly slack-jawed.

The eight male escorts surrounded Danica and started to pour wine into her glass. ""Pretty, let's play a drinking game.""

Florence beamed. ""Yeah, why not?""

Danica lost the first found, and one of the male escorts fed her wine. ""Drink, pretty.""

Danica emptied the glass, which upset the others. ""This is so unfair. Why did you drink the wine he offered you? What about us? We wanna feed you wine, too.""

Danica felt bittersweet‚Äîwhat should she do to make sure none of them feel left out?

Watching them, Wayne squinted. He stood up and walked forward, his expression darkening to the utmost.

Emilio was stunned. ""Wayne? Where are you going to?""

While Danica was drinking, a hand with slender fingers reached out, grabbed her by the wrist, and picked her up from the sofa effortlessly.

Startled, she looked up, only to see Wayne's handsome face.

She was stunned for a second before struggling hard, wanting to break free. ""Wayne, let go of me!""

Wayne pulled her to leave with a sullen face.

Florence stood up. ""What are you doing, Wayne? Let go of Dani!""

Emilio and the others were dumbfounded, wondering if they had misheard. ""Dani?""

""That angel is Danica?""

""She's that ugly duckling? No way!""

""I had no idea Danica is this stunning!""

Emilio froze as he gawked at Danica, who was dragged away by Wayne. He muttered, ""Fuck me! Danica has totally changed‚Äîshe no longer clings to Wayne and has become so breathtaking!""

I know this is screaming into the void, but the store always seemed busy to me, even with very limited parking.  I am sad to see it go as I found the location very pleasant with how it blended into the other Carillon Point boutiques even though it was a Starbucks, and it was also a nice neighborhood refuge during Covid times. 

I bought coffee once or twice a week at this Starbucks, but with some work travel missed last two weeks, so was totally caught off guard today with the closure and seemingly no notice (at least that I saw).  I know there are close by Starbucks to use if I wanted (albeit less convenient location wise for my personal commute), and I hope the baristas were able to be reassigned to other stores.

Carillon Kitchen sells coffee too, but as you can‚Äôt order ahead on an app, and they are already so slow it was a 15 minute difference to get a coffee there vs Starbucks ‚Äî and surely will be even slower now with customer spillover from this closure.

On this topic, a few other random Carillon Point thoughts 
- I can‚Äôt imagine how the postal office at Carillon Point is still operating, they can‚Äôt be profitable/make any sense to be there even if they have a sweetheart $1/month lease. 
- I wish Carillon Point management would restart the summer Saturday night movies in the plaza that they hosted pre-pandemic (and i think at least one year post-pandemic?).

1l1g3c7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l1g3c7,Sweetest dog just got aggressive,"Any advice is appreciated, because I‚Äôm truly at a loss.

My fiance and I adopted Cookie a month ago from our local humane society. She was found on the streets but it‚Äôs suspected she had a home before because she‚Äôs so well socialized with humans and dogs. She has been the sweetest most gentle dog ever and loves everybody and every puppy. We take her to parks and coffee shops with us, and everybody loves her and she‚Äôs so well behaved. If dogs are barking or fighting next to her, she‚Äôll come back to us and has no interest in involving herself.

Five days ago she got into a conflict with three dogs at a dog park. Three dogs twice her size jumped on her and bit her, so she fought back. The other dogs were okay but Cookie got a small puncture wound by her mouth. The owner of the other dogs put her hand in the middle of the dog fight and was bit, we are unsure by what dog. The cops were called, and all the dogs were put into rabies quarantine.

We‚Äôve been keeping a close eye on her ever since, especially to see if the trauma from that situation has made her afraid/reactive. No behavior has changed even if she sees dogs/humans (out of reach in accordance with quarantine rules of course) while we are on walks until about an hour ago. 

She was fine this morning when I took her out for a walk, and we went back to bed like we always do while my fiance got ready for work. Before she left, she came in to say goodbye and kissed Cookie on the head and grabbed something from our bedside table. Suddenly it was like a switch was flipped and cookie started growling/staring her down. She lunged to bite my fiance and lightly scratched her face in doing so. My fiance jumped back and stepped outside the room but Cookie kept growling so loudly and staring her down. Whenever I tried to hold her back the growling got more intense and I worried she‚Äôd start getting aggressive towards me too. 

My fiance grabbed her favorite treats (cookie is so food motivated she would normally be happy in an instant) but she didn‚Äôt have a single ounce of interest and kept displaying aggression. I stepped back and we both sweetly talked to her and encouraged her to take the treat. Eventually she reluctantly did, but her behavior was so off and she looked uncomfortable and confused. She‚Äôs been acting off ever since, just not warm and sweet like she normally is.

We‚Äôre really worried she could be sick, but we can‚Äôt take her to the vet while she‚Äôs under quarantine. I don‚Äôt know if these concerns are premature or dramatic, but we both feel so sick because we thought she would never behave this way. Her treats were also in a different drawer in the bedside table but she‚Äôs never shown aggression or possessiveness when we interact with those drawers before. 

Ultimately we just want to be safe and are terrified because we love her to death. Any advice is so appreciated, thank you. ",9,1748865363.0,DogAdvice,3,1.0,False

Let‚Äôs say there are 160 million workers in the U.S.

About 60% of them‚Äîso 96 million people‚Äîcan work from home at least part-time.

That‚Äôs:

	‚Ä¢	1 day/week √ó 50 work weeks = 50 saved commutes

-staffed with a human.

-has a convenience store.

-no trouble paying at the pump, but usually you pump first then go inside and pay.  The pumps work before taking payment (this one is actually UNlike the US).

I am terrified of needing gas in Italy.  I get nervous at a quarter tank because sometimes I have to try 3 or 4 different ones before I find one that works.

Very often no one is there.  There‚Äôs never a convenience store, ever.  Sometimes a coffee bar, but that‚Äôs not even close to the same thing, and seems to always be a completely separate business technically having nothing to do with the gas station.  This is problematic because it‚Äôs a 50/50 shot at best whether any of my American credit cards will work.  Sometimes you can stuff euro cash into the machine at the pump but I don‚Äôt always have euros.

How has Italy not figured out how to gas station like the rest of the world.  Everywhere else, literally everywhere else, Gas stations are welcoming, refreshing environments, offering bright lights, clean air, human service, a nice assortment of drinks and snacks, and my credit card fucking works.

Italian gas stations feel like they don‚Äôt want me there.  They straight up feel like a hostile environment.  Some tiny little spartan office that maybe sells windshield wiper blades which is usually shuttered up anyway.  Maybe a coffee bar that‚Äôs a separate business so they can‚Äôt help me with any gas pump issues.  Certainly no 7/11 style convenience store.

I work 6 out of 7 days a week with a weekday off and the hours are essentially 10 to 21.30 circa. Between coffee and meal breaks we have 100 minutes off during the day, still the total hours worked is basically 60 per week. Owner also gives us a room near the shop which is in a town of less than 30k people. 

I was told about a 1800‚Ç¨ monthly wage post taxes. It is seasonal work from March to early October. 

Is this a fair deal? I saw that working for 60 hours is not really allowed for long for worker's health

We were virtually inseparable friends for about 5 years prior to dating and we had, imo, an amazing relationship. We met when we were freshman in highschool and continued that closeness into adulthood where we eventually started dating.

Well, of course we had our ups and downs, as most long term couples do, but he started changing in January of last year. 

He was a very private person and we had always agreed that we would not go through each other's belongings. However, one morning I got curious and snooped. I saw that he had been messaging other women but didn't open the messages. I confronted him and asked if he was texting other women inappropriately, to which he responded absolutely not. I never told him that I saw the messages and I believed him, but it definitely sewed some discourse in between us.

While he's always struggled with winter depression, his depression didn't seem to go away throughout the summer. He loves to be out and about doing things but last summer he really embraced the hermit life style. We had our little traditions that suddenly became laborious and I had to beg until he agreed to do them, if he agreed at all. 

Flash forward to fall, he takes a vacation around his birthday and we fought essentially all of it. The week he went back to work, we had the worst fight we had had the entire relationship and it was over the smallest thing. Well, after that he became even more distant. I noticed that he was being extra protective of his phone during this time but brushed it off. 

I was hospitalized with a kidney stone shortly after this happened and everything changed. We went to bed and everything was okay. However, when we woke up, he wanted nothing to do with me. We're both extremely affectionate people and we often did most things together. Our Sunday's had a fairly strict routine, we would lay in bed and plan dinner for the week, then shower, get coffee, and go wander. He was having none of it.

After that, he asked for space and that I go stay with my family out of state on the weekends. I, begrudgingly, obliged as I thought he was truly having mental health crisis and was trying to give him what he needed to recover. 

Well, long story short he was having an affair with his coworker. He and I both got very ill during this time, as neither of us were eating or sleeping, and everything came to a head last December when I confronted him and we separated. I moved out in just under three weeks and she basically moved in that day. 

We continued to have a friendship, despite everyone's dismay, until it was revealed that after we separated, I had starting having a relationship with one of his friends (his friend was the one that told me about the affair). We had gotten an apartment together and what was supposed to be a roommate situation, blossomed into something more. 

We eventually went no contact at the end of February, as it was causing issues in his relationship and he felt very betrayed by my actions. 

He's broken contact twice now, once was about a situation of him coming to my job and the other was the other day apologizing and asking if I would be willing to meet so he could explain some things. 

Issue: I went and spoke with him because I thought it would give me some closure, as I had been struggling pretty hard the last few weeks to deal with what had happened. It was just over three hours but we both just left everything out. We caught up and we cried together, a lot. But he asked me to come back. He talked a lot about his current situation and a lot of the struggles he has. He admitted to a lot of things he had refused to in the past and even gave me parameters for how our relationship would be different, if I chose to come back. He agreed to thing's that he would have never even considered prior.

I'm very torn. I left out quite a bit of detail in this, as the post is long enough, but our separation turned us both into monsters that neither one of us knew existed. I'm struggling to believe that he's being genuine, because even through all of this, he is protecting her still.

I'm also fairly involved with my current relationship but I really struggle with a lot because I didn't let myself heal at all before jumping into new relationship. There are a lot of days that I struggle to get excited about having a future because of that. 

At the end of the day, I know it was unfair to my current relationship to do that but I tried very hard to be honest with where I was at. I, also, have always been upfront about any communication and meetings I have ever had with my ex. (Meetings = I would go sit in his driveway once a week when I collected mail and we would talk for about an hour about random things.)

I'm at a genuine loss because I do regret how things ended between us and I do feel like he is changing, but I also enjoy the current relationship I'm in, as we are fairly happy and have the same goals for our future. I'm not so sure that's worth giving up over someone that was so careless with it the first time.",2,1748864926.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I just wanted to tell my story because I don‚Äôt really have anyone to share it with. Sorry if it‚Äôs long ‚Äî I just hope someone out there understands.

I moved to Australia not long ago, and since then, it‚Äôs felt like I‚Äôve been stuck in a storm I can‚Äôt get out of. I‚Äôm trying to build a better future ‚Äî I‚Äôve applied for a Computer Science degree and dream of doing something meaningful with my life. But there‚Äôs so much pressure on me, especially from my family.

My dad is a construction worker. He‚Äôs worked hard his whole life to support us, and now he‚Äôs tired ‚Äî physically and mentally. He says he can‚Äôt do it anymore and wants me to take over. It breaks my heart because I love him and I want to help. But if I follow the same path, it means repeating the same cycle: another generation without education, another dream left behind. And I‚Äôve always wanted to break that chain.

Now, I‚Äôm the only one who can carry the family. Every day, I hear things like, ‚ÄúYou need to get a job,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt work anymore,‚Äù and it makes me feel like I and my dreams are the reason for all the family‚Äôs struggles. Every conversation, every moment, ends up being about me doing construction. It eats me up inside.

I started doing construction work a while ago ‚Äî not because I wanted to, but because it paid slightly better than other jobs I could get as a newcomer with no experience. I told myself it would just be temporary, just to save up for uni tuition and my basic expenses. But now they expect me to support the whole family too. I‚Äôm trying, but juggling this kind of work with my studies feels impossible.

I have ideas. Small business ideas. App ideas. Ways to build passive income. Just enough to lift at least a bit of the financial weight off my shoulders. But when I get home, I‚Äôm just exhausted ‚Äî physically broken and mentally drained. The work environment is toxic, and it kills every bit of motivation I have left.

A few months ago, I also fell for someone ‚Äî a girl who made me feel something I hadn‚Äôt felt in a long time. I got rejected, and it hurt more than I expected. Her smile still shows up in my mind at the worst times, and it‚Äôs hard to move on.

I look at other people my age ‚Äî 18, 19 ‚Äî and they‚Äôre out living life. Dressing well, having fun, doing normal things. I walk past stores, cafes, and events I can‚Äôt afford to step into. Even small things like buying clothes or a coffee feel out of reach. I feel invisible. Behind. Like I‚Äôm constantly chasing something I‚Äôll never catch.

The loneliness is the worst part. Even when I‚Äôm around people, I feel like I‚Äôm not really there. I miss my old friends. I miss who I used to be. Here I haven‚Äôt made one single friend. During the week I work hard and on weekend I have no one to go out with and get fresh air. And some days, I honestly think: if I wasn‚Äôt around, maybe things would be easier for my family. Maybe all the pressure would disappear. I know it‚Äôs a dark thought‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt lie ‚Äî it‚Äôs been there.

I‚Äôve stopped enjoying things I used to love. Even eating my favorite food feels empty now. Nothing brings joy the way it used to. Every day feels like a fight just to keep going.

I‚Äôm still trying to stay strong. I really am. But it‚Äôs hard. I don‚Äôt think if going to a therapist would help cuz she‚Äôs not going to pay for my tuition or support my family which are my main problems, is she?

If you‚Äôve read all this, thank you. I‚Äôm not really looking for advice ‚Äî though if you‚Äôve got something to say, I‚Äôm open.
I just needed to let this out somewhere.

And if you‚Äôre going through something too, I hope you find peace. You deserve it.
We both do.

1l1fvn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1l1fvn7/i_need_help_processing_what_i_just_experienced/,I need help processing what I just experienced.,"A few days ago me (33m) and my gf (32f) of nearly 6 months broke apart. She left me. The manner of it left me confused and, honestly, hurt at a psychological level. To preface; In the 5 and half months of knowing her the relationship felt so much more meaningful and the connection felt so much more intense then it ever did in my previous relationship which was 4 years long.

From the start, the charm hit me like a truck and for the first 4 months she showered me in praise. She would often compare me to her ex and say how much different and better I am. Specifically she mentioned that she isn't used to someone that actually wants to spend time with her. She would consistently say things like ""I never knew what it was like to be in a good relationship until now"" and call me perfect, tell me how much she likes having me around and that I'm free to come around hers whenever I want. I completely reciprocated the endearment she heaped on me and I poured so much energy into her. She was often overwhelmed with work, looking after her 1 year old child (who she had with the previous ex) and I would always come around and help clean up the house, mow her lawn ect. She told me she likes how I look after her.
When it came to mobile comms, she prewarned me right at the start that she is a terrible texter. For me this wasn't an issue and she would often leave me on read for the majority of the day before she got back to me and I wouldn't bat an eyelid. But we always made some form of communication atleast once a day. She would often go out cycling, see her friends and family and quite often I would accommodate last minute changes to something we had planned together so she can cycle on a sunnier day. The sex was amazing. Everything felt balanced and normal.

We had our first holiday for 5 days in April. It was physically exhausting. The bed was rigid so sleep quality was poor, especially for her and we were constantly ascending/descending old Italian stepways each day.
The first night back on a sunday I told her I'd spend at mine to give us space to decompress away from each other. We ended up spending the majority of the week apart just to give each other space.

The following weekend I stayed the night at hers and she blew up at me halfway through the night shouting at me she can't sleep because I'm here. I calmly offered to leave and she said no she doesn't want me to leave. Following morning she blows up at me again shouting at me if I want breakfast. I literally started sobbing while she calmly started feeding her baby his breakfast. She didn't even acknowledge how upset I was by the outbursts. I just grabbed my things and left. She was so cold and emotionless.

Stupid me reached out later with understanding and I explained that I get shes feeling overwhelmed but i asked if she understands why I was upset. She apologised for being grumpy (grumpy is understating it) and invited me around. At hers I sat down and I brought up the topic of space. I asked her if she required more space away from me and she assured me that's not the problem and it's the lack of sleep she has been having. I took her word for it but made a conscious effort anyway to trim back how many nights a week to spend with her.

From there on the relationship got progressively more hot and cold. Texts increasingly became less frequent. I would more often than not be left on read. But she more frequently phoned so I didn't think much of it. She was a lot less reassuring with me. The sex was still happening though and she would always open up with reassurance post sex. One night she told me she loved me and I reciprocated.

The past couple of weeks things got weird. She would make nasty jabs at me. I'm self conscious about my hair (it's thin) and she made fun of it while we were at dinner. A couple of times I phoned her and she would reply saying she meant to phone me but decided she would rather do something else. I fucking hate myself for not standing up for myself then and there.

The second to last phonecall I ever had with her she told me she had been feeling down all week. She brought up what it would look like if we moved in together. She mentioned losing her space and freedom. She complained about having to look after her child more because the ex bf was working longer days and how that affected her cycling routine. I reasoned with her that if we move in together, she would actually have more freedom because I would help take up the burden of childcare, walking the dog and maintaining the house which will free her to do the things she loves. And she would have space because I still have work and I want to train myself. She ended up sounding very agreeable to it. We had plans for that following weekend but I offered her space for the weekend which she declined. This would be our last weekend together. On the Sunday I woke up feeling down with this gut-wrenching feeling. I left for work that afternoon and I sent her a messaging apologising for being down which she responded by suggesting I was just bored with her. Which wasn't the case.

For the rest of that week she pretty much ghosted me. I had no comms from her all week. I only sent her one message telling her I miss her and hope she's doing okay. I knew she had an overnight volunteer trip on Wednesday night with work, and she had mentioned she would be home Thursday afternoon. I returned home from work Thursday night and phoned her, but she didn't answer.
So I chose to go around to hers and knock on her door. She approached the door and when she saw it was me, she u-turned and went to the kitchen at the back. I went around to the side door and knocked on the door where I could see she was in the kitchen pretending I wasn't there. It really fucking hurt. But at that point I knew it was over and I said through the door I want my stuff. She grabbed all my stuff then came back and opened the door. She let me in where she told me she's breaking up and I asked why to which she said I don't give her space and it's stressing me out. She criticised me for coming around uninvited and I defended myself saying I haven't heard from her all week and I'm coming around as a responsible partner to see if you're okay. I asked her when she decided to leave me, and she literally pondered for a minute as if she was trying to remember some casual occasion. She was so cold and emotionless. I asked her if there was somebody else (I shouldn't have.) She said no. I told her I really liked her and I'm sad this has ended and left.

I made the mistake of messaging her the next morning saying I don't want to end on a rough note, and we should talk about things over a coffee. She asked what that would achieve and I replied mutual understanding. If space was the issue, we should really have sat down earlier and discussed.

She replied in the most demeaning and degrading way possible. Took everything she accepted about me at the start and used it against me. I defended myself saying I offered her space multiple times and called her out for calling me a loser even though she told me the whole time about how perfect I am. I wished her peace and happiness and that was my last message to her.

She sent another message 10 minutes after that which I have left unread. But from the notification bar I can see it is full of contempt and hate. That she's relieved and she the reassurance she gave me the whole time was just to make me happy.

The whole thing has left me so disturbed, like I'vebeen subject to a psychological experiment. I feel like this will have a profound impact on how I handle future relationships.",1,1748864665.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I was wrong. I have spent the last two days in bed, feeling extremely fatigued and miserable. I broke on the healthy eating this morning and ended up eating two croissants (didn't make me feel especially better or worse).

Cravings are up, emotionally volatility is up and generally hating life right now.

However, for science's sake, I will stick with the lifestyle interventions for the next cycle as u/jiig5aw said it might take a few cycles for the interventions to take effect.

I'm looking for recommendations for remote access to my homelab. I've got Jellyfin and immich for example. 

Currently using a wgVPN directed to a custom domain then a local DNS to access the service.On some WiFIs it doesn't work (coffee shop/business, where handshake doesn't complete)

Ideally I'd be able set up a white list of people that can connect and block everyone else. I'd prefer not to expose ports etc. I've looked at cloud flare tunnels/pangolin. My concerns is these providers streaming/throttling speeds, in a  pangolin use case I'd be using a VPS.

Appreciate your thoughts on setup

1l1fo21,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1l1fo21/some_small_pieces_of_advice_i_dont_see_often/,Some small pieces of advice I don't see often,"I came back from my first trip to Japan (Golden Route plus Nara) and have a handful of tips that might be useful.

1. The tourist side of Kyoto is hard to deal with (basically east of Kamo river plus parts of Arashiyama). I have stayed residential near Tambaguchi, 10 minute walk to major train stations (Tambaguchi and Umek≈çji-Ky≈çtonishi) and 2 minute ride to Kyoto and was super happy. Trains are frequent and there's plenty of space outside of the morning and afternoon peak. It had a vibe of a city break, with rentable bikes everywhere, small coffee shops, loads of vendors (many fresh fish, sushi was amazing!) and authentic restaurants/izakayas. To be fair, I could have safely spend 2 days just exploring the local neighborhood and wish I had more time to do so. I know many people struggle in Kyoto due to overtourism, but if you want to experience Japan in a slower, less Instagram-y way this is a perfect solution. This is what made me fall in love with Kyoto and what made me want to come back there as soon as I can - I know people get discouraged by places like Gion. 

2. If you can stay in a place with a sento or if there is a sento near you please go and use it. Read how to use (basically wash yourself from head to toe carefully and don't pay attention to all the naked people) and get yourself soaking. If you have access to an outside water source that is even better. After an hour of circulating between hot spring, sauna and a cold bath I was giggling at ice cream served downstairs as a part of the experience. I wish we had something similar in the UK. 

3. I was getting small ""perks"" from speaking a 2-year old level Japanese. We are talking past arigatou but with simple one verb sentences. I would really recommend learning as much as you can/are able to before going. Japanese people, especially in the service industry, really appreciate when they don't have to refresh a high-school English (and are more willing to accommodate to you). I would always say I speak a child-level Japanese and asked to speak slowly and simply and had great experiences (and a handful of free desserts or seating spaces where others were turned away). 

4. If you make a mistake, have a think of how to be the least nuisance possible. I am extremely clumsy and felt like a bull in a China shop in Japan but just tried my best. On public transport, make yourself small, don't be in other people's spaces if you can avoid it. Follow others, if they are putting their backpacks in front of them, probably do the same or put it on a little shelf above the seats - it's Japan, trust me, no one will touch it. Keep your suitcase in front of you and out of the way. If you accidentally get into a female-only cart just move the hell on to a different carriage, don't joke about being a ""lesbian"" or ""suddenly non-binary"" with your male mates, you are spoiling it. There's AMPLE signage in MULTIPLE languages and everything is pink. Yes, sometimes it's time or route dependent, but I would just aim on the side of caution if you are not 100% sure. 

5. Some things have different meanings or are not what you are used to. I went to the toilet in one of the gardens in Kyoto, marked with a Western toilet sign and it was a squatting one, I only found out when I entered. Free breakfast might be a Japanese-style breakfast (watching a lady being offended by being offered a grilled fish and pickles and tea instead of coffee was entertaining). Bukkake ramen just means the liquid is poured on the noodles, it has ZERO porn connotations. Train types (express, rapid, local etc) are confusing to me and I relied on Google Maps and STILL have no idea if I was paying the right amount. 

6. Luggage forwarding is the best thing I have ever experienced and remember you can send your suitcases to the airport directly, so I sent mine 4 days in advance and just packed a half-empty carry on with some clothes and space to buy more souvenirs. It's monopolized by Yamato (the one with a mom cat and a baby cat in her mouth), but some hotels also utilize regular Japanese post. Tracking is amazing and current, but you can put an air tag in your luggage if you are worried. A large 23kg suitcase with a smaller 11kg carry on cost me ¬£25 to be sent from Tokyo to Osaka Kansai Airport. The same large suitcase I sent between Kyoto and Tokyo for about ¬£10. I think the transport form needs to be filled in kanji so asked hotel staff for help, but local Yamato offices (which are literally everywhere) will help as well and they have luggage scales and measuring tapes so no need to check yourself. 

7. Plan relax days, not at the end of your trip, in the very middle or 1/3 and 2/3 of the way. I was an exhausted potato after climbing Inari and a day full of adventures the first day in Kyoto and spent the next day in Arashiyama with my feet in the water, snacking on senbei. I had a morning in Tokyo just to sit in a park and watch people a week later. It wasn't about the feet hurting, I am good with my walking (although Japan is next level and I would recommend the best walking shoes you can afford). It's the mental strain of language, navigation, logistics and everything being different. I would start forgetting easy things and managed to loose my bank card which is something very unusual for me and I blame the tiredness. I've heard about people leaving their passports at tax-free counters and konbinis. I know the trip is expensive and it feels like once in a lifetime, but I didn't do half of the things I planned and still had an amazing time and I am motivated to come back. 

8. Train stations are MAZES and it's reasonable to add 10-15 minutes to your journey; don't worry, the transport comes often. The stairs can kill you, if you can take a lift do it, as you never know how many stairs/floors there are exactly. Listen to Google maps when it tells you which carriage to be in as the platforms can be long. In case of Shinkansens I would give myself at least 30 minutes, I think these spaces were the most challenging. The signage is in three-four languages but the sheer amount of space/walking takes it out of you. Also, there are secret underground passages that Google doesn't always show (thinking of Namba walk between Namba station and Dotonbori in Osaka where it's easier to walk with a suitcase as it has a shopping centre style flat surface to roll on in opposition to rough pavement and less people and really convenient when it rains). 

9. You think you can do humidity? Think again. Just take advantage of the cooling supplies Japan has, the AC, the neck fans, the cooling sprays (saved me in Osaka), the cooling wipes from Biore and most importantly the sunscreen as even when it's cloudy the sun is strong. Deodorant was not enough for my thighs so I wore anti-chaffing shorts under my dresses, bonus points for being protected from upskirting and mirror floors in TeamLabs. 

10. TikTok told you food is superior in X place? Food is also superior in Y, Z and probably the whole alphabet in your close proximity. Unless something is CRAZY unusual and you are desperate to have it (thinking unusual cafes like the Pokemon ones or animal ones) there are places around that are not promoted on social media and still taste great. Tabelog plus putting your nearest train station is amazingly helpful, you normally don't need to book unless you are in a 3+ person group. Don't wait more than 15-20 minutes, unless it's something extraordinary and only served in that one spot. The longest I waited was in Kacto in Kyoto but it was a tourist-heavy spot, lunchtime and this one was the only non-tourist trap place in close proximity I saved plus they put me in a virtual queue and told me to go for a walk down Kamo so the 20 minutes didn't quite feel like it. The louder the restaurant screams - I am talking people telling you to come in, putting massive WAGYU POSTERS or ENGLISH MENU AVAILABLE COME HERE notices, the less likely I would go inside. BTW, sometimes when English menu is  not available, the restaurant is on Tabelog, has the menu published and if you go through your phone browser Google Translate can translate for you. 

11. Alcohol, especially in izakayas, is so cheap it actually shocked me. You can take advantage of it or it can take advantage of you, your choice. 

12. Some restaurants and izakayas are certified to serve raw chicken (in a form of sashimi or undercooked meat). It might NOT be clearly explained on the menu, especially if it's google translated (mine was called red chicken and I assumed it was a chicken type). This is something I didn't know and when I got my chicken breast pink in the middle I was confused and needed to Google the exact phrase used in the menu to make sure it was safe plus had fears of salmonella and food poisoning days after. It was delicious and tender and made really well BUT I would still check carefully when getting chicken it is what you want it to be. Same goes for raw eggs - super popular condiment with beef dishes in Japan; if you can't stomach it then just skip it, but if you can, it actually is a great dipping sauce.

**The United States allowed its rare earth metals industry to move to China and could now face severe economic disruption as China limits crucial supplies.**

[U.S. Dependence on China for Rare Earth Magnets Is Causing Shortages - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/business/china-rare-earths-united-states-supplies.html)

[Workers in China at the Magnequench Company making magnetic powders and other products using rare earth metals in 2013. The company closed a plant in Indiana two decades ago.Credit...Sim Chi Yin for The New York Times](https://preview.redd.it/em8mqplwwh4f1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1183dae5c614790cce75a1c10bfcfb4745ab735)

Two decades ago, factories in Indiana that turned rare earth metals into magnets moved production to China ‚Äî just as demand for the magnets was starting to soar for everything from cars and semiconductors to fighter jets and robots.

The United States is now reckoning with the cost of losing that supply chain. The Chinese government¬†[abruptly halted exports](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/business/china-rare-earths-exports.html)¬†of rare earth magnets to any country on April 4 as part of its trade war with the United States.

American officials had expected that China would relax its restrictions on the magnets as part of the¬†[trade truce](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/business/china-us-export-controls.html)¬†the two countries reached in mid-May. But on Friday, President Trump suggested that China had continued to¬†[limit access](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/politics/trump-china-trade.html).

Now, American and European companies are running out of the magnets.

American automakers are the hardest hit, with executives warning that production at factories across the Midwest and South could be cut back in the coming days and weeks. Carmakers need the magnets for the electric motors that run brakes, steering and fuel injectors. The motors in a single luxury car seat, for example, use as many as 12 magnets.

Factory robots depend on rare earth magnets, too.

‚ÄúThis is America‚Äôs, and the world‚Äôs, Achilles‚Äô heel, which China continuously exploits,‚Äù said Nazak Nikakhtar, who was the assistant secretary of commerce overseeing export controls during Mr. Trump‚Äôs first term.

The Chinese government has said little lately about its rare earth export restrictions. Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, said on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis Week‚Äù on Sunday that Mr. Trump and China‚Äôs leader, Xi Jinping, could speak about trade as soon as this week, though no date had been set.

After China stopped all exports, it said that future shipments would require separate export licenses. China‚Äôs Ministry of Commerce has struggled since then to issue licenses. It gave a handful to European companies in mid-April and a few more for American companies last week, but world supplies are dwindling fast.

‚ÄúThere are a few approvals coming through, but they are far from being sufficient to prevent imminent production halts,‚Äù said Jens Eskelund, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. ‚ÄúWe are still facing a major disruption of supply chains.‚Äù

To make matters worse, some Chinese rare earth magnet makers have stopped producing while waiting for permission to resume exports. The weekslong gap in magnet production is moving through supply chains and may soon reach manufacturers.

‚ÄúChina could bring America‚Äôs automotive assembly plants to a standstill,‚Äù said Michael Dunne, an automotive consultant specializing in China.

China produces 90 percent of the world‚Äôs nearly 200,000 tons a year of high-performance rare earth magnets. Japanese companies produce most of the rest in Japan and Vietnam, mainly for Japanese manufacturers.

The United States produces practically none, although small factories will start full production this year in South Carolina and Texas. A succession of administrations has tried to restart the industry ever since China drew attention to its dominance by imposing a two-month¬†[embargo on shipments](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/business/global/23rare.html)¬†of rare earths to Japan during a territorial dispute in 2010.

But little has happened because of a gritty reality: Making rare earth magnets requires considerable investments at every stage of production. Yet the sales and profits are tiny.

[Heavy mining equipment hauling material across a rare earth facility in Mountain Pass, Calif., in 2015. It is the sole American rare earths mine.Credit...David Becker\/Reuters](https://preview.redd.it/h6j4o9n6xh4f1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad9bdb6b9e3009062dd2a4340faedac8a38185ae)

Worldwide sales of mined rare earths total only $5 billion a year. That is minuscule compared with $300 billion industries like copper mining or iron ore mining.

China has a formidable competitive advantage. The state-owned industry has few environmental compliance costs for its mines and an almost unlimited government budget for building huge processing refineries and magnet factories.

Processing rare earths is technically demanding, but China has developed new processes. Rare earth chemistry programs are offered in 39 universities across the country, while the United States has no similar programs.

China refines over 99 percent of the world‚Äôs supply of so-called heavy rare earths, which are the least common kinds of rare earths. Heavy rare earths are essential for making magnets that can resist the high temperatures and electrical fields found in cars, semiconductors and many other technologies.

The sole American rare earths mine, located in Mountain Pass, Calif., stopped producing in 1998 after traces of heavy metals and faintly radioactive material leaked from a desert pipeline. Chinese state-controlled companies tried three times without success to buy the defunct mine before it was acquired by American investors in 2008.

A $1 billion Pentagon-backed investment program followed in 2010 to improve environmental compliance and expand the mine and its adjacent refinery. But the costly complex was unable to compete when it briefly reopened in 2014, and closed again the next year.

MP Materials, a Chicago investor group that included a minority partner company partly owned by the Chinese government, bought the mine in 2017. The mine reopened the next year, but shipped its ore to China for the difficult task of separating the various kinds of rare earths.

Only in recent months has the mine become able to chemically separate the rare earths in more than half its output. But this loses money because processing in China is so inexpensive.

MP Materials built the new factory in Texas that will turn separated rare earths into magnets.

A considerable bottleneck lies in transforming separated rare earths into chemically pure metal ingots that can be fed into the furnaces of magnet-making machines. A New England start-up, Phoenix Tailings, is addressing that shortcoming, but its small scale underlines the challenge.

Phoenix Tailings has taken over much of the staff and equipment of Infinium, a start-up that had tried to do the same thing. Infinium ran out of money in 2020, when American policymakers were more focused on the Covid-19 pandemic than rare earths.

***With Chinese rare earth minerals hard to get, Phoenix makes the metal from mine tailings: leftover material at mines that has already been processed once to remove another material, like iron.***

Phoenix Tailings has four machines each the size of a small cottage at its factory in Burlington, Mass. Each one produces a 6.6-pound ingot every three hours around the clock. The operation‚Äôs overall capacity is 40 tons a year, said Nick Myers, Phoenix‚Äôs chief executive. He declined to identify the buyer but said it was an automotive company.

Phoenix is installing equipment at a larger site in Exeter, N.H., to produce metal at a rate of 200 tons a year ‚Äî still tiny compared with Chinese factories that produce more than that in a month.

Thomas Villal√≥n Jr., Phoenix‚Äôs chief technical officer, said that ramping up production quickly was important during a trade war: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a race right now.‚Äù

[China‚Äôs exploitation of its monopoly over rare earth elements](https://nypost.com/2025/01/13/business/chinas-chokehold-on-critical-minerals-puts-us-in-unfathomable-national-security-bind-experts/)¬†has become a major sticking point in high-stakes trade talks with President Trump ‚Äì and experts warn the US needs to prepare for the worst.

Beijing has infuriated Trump officials by failing to loosen its crackdown on exports of seven ‚Äúheavy‚Äù rare earth metals which are essential for gadgets like smartphones and electric cars as well as military hardware like F-35 fighter jets and drones.

On Friday, Trump fumed that China had ‚Äútotally violated‚Äù the terms of a preliminary trade agreement struck in Geneva, which included a 90-day tariff truce that runs until mid-August. Trump didn‚Äôt elaborate, but US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said one concern was that China ‚Äúcontinues to, you know, slow down and choke off‚Äù the flow of critical minerals to the US.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will speak soon to iron out the trade issues including¬†the dispute over critical minerals.

‚ÄúWhat China is doing is they are holding back products that are essential for the industrial supply chains of India, of Europe. And that is not what a reliable partner does,‚Äù Bessent said in an interview¬†[with CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace the Nation.‚Äù](https://nypost.com/2025/06/01/us-news/treasury-secretary-scott-bessent-schools-cbs-anchor-over-wrong-inflation-prediction-numbers-are-the-best-in-4-years/)

‚ÄúThey are withholding some of the products that they agreed to release during our agreement ‚Äî maybe it‚Äôs a glitch in the Chinese system, maybe it‚Äôs intentional. We‚Äôll see after the President speaks with the party chairman.‚Äù

***Nonetheless, any talk from China of a trade truce is ‚Äúlittle more than window dressing,‚Äù according to longtime mining executive Mark A. Smith, whose firm NioCorp has a rare earths facility under development in Nebraska.***

***‚ÄúChina is strategically choosing minerals for export restrictions that have a disproportionate impact on our military readiness and national defense,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúThey hold virtually all of the cards.‚Äù***

Since 2023, China has implemented export controls on at least 16 critical minerals as part of what DC insiders and other experts describe as a highly targeted campaign aimed at disrupting US defense and tech supply chains.

In the case of the seven heavy rare earth metals most recently targeted with new licensing rules, China controls as much as 99% of global processing capacity. In turn, the Trump administration has irritated China by imposing¬†[ever-tighter export controls on US-made computer chips needed in artificial intelligence.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-30/us-plans-wider-china-tech-sanctions-with-subsidiary-crackdown)

Trump‚Äôs proposed takeover of resource-rich Greenland is widely seen as part of his strategy to curtail the country‚Äôs reliance on China. Elsewhere, the US recently struck terms on a mineral rights deal with Ukraine, even as talks to end the war with Russia have floundered. ¬†

Mineral sites in Greenland and Ukraine, however, are many years away from making a dent in US demand. Experts said they are best seen as part of a broader strategy that includes increased domestic mining, as well as close collaboration with resource-rich allies to decrease reliance on China.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a reliability of access problem,‚Äù one House aide briefed on the situation told The Post. ‚ÄúAs we stand right now, I think we‚Äôre very underprepared and you can‚Äôt buy processing capacity off the shelf.‚Äù

The risk of a total embargo in response to rising geopolitical tensions may seem far-fetched, but it has a precedent. In 2010, China briefly sparked chaos when it halted shipments of rare earth elements to Japan while the two countries were locked in a territorial dispute.

Some insiders believe that China would inevitably resort to similar tactics in the event of a more serious diplomatic dispute with the US ‚Äì such as a potential invasion of Taiwan.

Congress needs to ‚Äúanticipate the worst,‚Äù according to Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), a retired Air Force officer and a member of the House Armed Services Committee.

[Rep. Don Bacon \(R-Neb.\) arrives for a House Republican conference meeting at the US Capitol on May 6, 2025 in Washington, DC.Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/e5zozauqyh4f1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=8085ee68d3e62ea973fff75229e35bc04d72af29)

**‚ÄúAfter 30 years in the military, I found that we tend to exaggerate the enemy‚Äôs capabilities, but we tend underestimate their intentions,‚Äù Bacon said in an interview. ‚ÄúAnd I think if this is an option for China and we‚Äôre playing hardball, oh, yeah, they can shut this stuff down if they wanted. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs very important that we find alternative areas.‚Äù**

A White House official said Trump is taking corrective action after former President Joe Biden ‚Äúdeprioritized domestic mining and delayed permitting for years in favor of ‚Äògreen‚Äô energy projects.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn President Trump‚Äôs first 100 days, he has taken bold, decisive steps to reverse course,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúHe signed Executive Order 14241 to ramp up American mineral production, launched a National Critical Minerals Strategy, fast-tracked permitting for key projects, and initiated a Section 232 investigation into Chinese mineral imports.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe administration is also pursuing new market mechanisms, export controls on mineral recycling, and a fund to accelerate US dominance in this vital sector,‚Äù the White House official added.

The Center for Strategic and International Studies warned in a recent report the US military was ‚Äúparticularly vulnerable‚Äù to any disruption to shipments of heavy rare earths.

First announced in April, China‚Äôs licensing requirements on rare earth magnets left Western firms scrambling to restock before their dwindling stockpiles ran out. The broad shift toward ‚Äújust-in-time‚Äù supply chains over the last few decades means many companies retain just three-to-six months‚Äô worth of critical minerals.

Not even Elon Musk, who has cultivated close ties to both Beijing and Trump while leading Tesla, is immune from the negative effects. During Tesla‚Äôs April 22 earnings call, Musk admitted that China‚Äôs¬†[export controls on rare earth magnets could delay production](https://nypost.com/2025/04/22/business/teslas-net-income-plunges-71-as-elon-musk-confirms-major-work-setting-up-doge-is-done/)¬†of the company‚Äôs Optimus humanoid robot.

Metals traders and other executives across various industries are already ‚Äúvery, very concerned‚Äù and have begun sounding the alarm on Capitol Hill about how problematic a long-term shutdown would be for the economy, the House aide said.

‚ÄúIn the emails that we get about the potential impact of a sustained and meaningful rare earth control on the US market, the response is pretty frantic,‚Äù the House aide said.

Some legislative efforts are underway in Congress to address the budding crisis. Rep. Rob Wittman (R-Va.), who leads the House Select Committee on China‚Äôs Critical Minerals Policy Working Group, has backed a trio of bills aimed at fixing the US supply chain and fighting back against China‚Äôs attempts to leverage its monopoly.

As The Post has reported, industry officials have also called on the US government to ease burdensome regulations and environmental permitting processes that have chilled investment in rare earth mining and caused major delays for existing projects.

# JUNE 1st, 2025~Japan proposes rare earth cooperation with US in trade talks

[Japan proposes rare earth cooperation with US in trade talks - MINING.COM](https://www.mining.com/japan-proposes-rare-earth-cooperation-with-us-in-trade-talks/)

[Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba meeting with US President Donald Trump earlier this year. Credit: Government of Japan via X](https://preview.redd.it/xhyoexoyzh4f1.png?width=1477&format=png&auto=webp&s=a15151b706d495419fb23b60dca4870c8ec05e9b)

Japan is looking to bolster its economic ties with the United States by establishing a partnership around critical minerals such as rare earths, local media reported.

According to¬†[*The Yomiuri Shimbun*](https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/politics/politics-government/20250530-257266/), it is believed that Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba presented this proposal in a phone call with US President Donald Trump on Thursday as part of the negotiation process to bring down the US trade deficit with Japan.

Amongst the topics discussed, the newspaper reported, were greater cooperation in economic security, including collaborations in rare earths.

Rare earth minerals have taken centre stage in America‚Äôs trade tussle with China, which weaponized its strong position in the supply chain by restricting exports to the US.

For decades, China has controlled the global rare earths supply and now accounts for over 60% of the world‚Äôs mine production and almost all of the processing. The US relies on imports of rare earths ‚Äì a group of 17 elements used in a wide range of high-tech applications ‚Äì and has them on its list of critical minerals.

Between 2019 and 2022, about 72% of the US rare earth imports came from China, according to the US Geological Survey. Japan also accounted for 6% of the imports, though its rare earth metals were derived from mineral concentrates produced in China.

*The Yomiuri Shimbun*, citing its sources, said the Japanese government is considering providing technical support for the processing and refining of these minerals. Another idea that has been floated is to process the minerals in a third country that has the expertise but at lower costs.

Also part of Ishiba‚Äôs proposed cooperative measures are semiconductors and shipbuilding, the newspaper said, with sources indicating that they too could be powerful bargaining chips in negotiations.

Japan currently has more semiconductor manufacturing plants than any other nation. Meanwhile the US, which has the second most, has been looking to redomicile some of the production so its exports will grow.

In shipbuilding, China also holds a dominant position in the global market with a 70% share. To mitigate Beijing‚Äôs influence, Tokyo‚Äôs proposal would involve the joint construction of next-generation ships,¬†*The Yomiuri Shimbun*¬†said.

# MAY 31st, 2025~Quarterhorse Mark 1 takes to the air in race for commercial hypersonic (TITANIUM ALLOY)

[Hermeus advances hypersonic flight with successful prototype test](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/quarterhorse-mark-1-takes-to-the-air-race-commercial-hypersonic)

https://preview.redd.it/61lxmqvh0i4f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=90b7d9af99ece37ce297382553ac539a88281c9d

Hermeus seems dead keen on fast-tracking its way to hypersonic passenger flight. Its uncrewed subsonic Quarterhorse Mark 1 prototype has completed its maiden flight in the skies over Edwards Air Force Base in California on May 21, 2025.

Hypersonic flight looks to be the flavor du jour of the aerospace world these days, which isn't surprising. Not only is it poised to revolutionize warfare, it also has the potential to alter civilian cargo and passenger travel in ways far beyond what Concorde and its kin promised but never delivered in the 1960s.

The tricky bit is how to, pardon the pun, get it all off the ground. Since its founding in 2018, Hermeus has been pursuing a novel development strategy. Instead of the conventional approach of working directly on a final aircraft preceded by, perhaps, a flying prototype or two that approximate the performance of the ultimate aircraft, the company has been working on highly specialized prototypes designed to specifically test various systems without any pretense of being anything like a hypersonic plane.

For example, in November 2023, Hermeus rolled out its¬†[Quarterhorse Mark 0](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/quarterhorse-mk-0-challenge-sr-71-speed-record/?itm_source=newatlas&itm_medium=article-body). This looked like a bit of a joke because it had one obvious flaw: it couldn't fly. In fact, that was, as they say in software development, a feature, not a bug. The whole idea was to speed up progress while reducing risks and costs by working on a series of prototypes that were each a new iteration of the technology designed to operate in a particular realm ‚Äì on the ground, then subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flight.

It's an approach that seems to be working, since the Mark 1 went from sketch to flight in under a year.

The purpose of the May 21 flight was to meet a series of objectives. Powered by a single General Electric J85 turbojet engine, the 40-ft (12.2-m) uncrewed aircraft lifted off from the dry lake bed under remote control to test its capacity to handle high-speed takeoffs and landings. This was a primary goal because the Mark 1's 12-ft (3.66-m) wingspan is designed for high speed, so it has low-aspect-ratio wings that have to deal with high wing loading and a low thrust-to-weight ratio.

In my previous life, fate took my sister and me down very different paths. She was adopted by a wealthy family, while I went to live with a janitor couple.

The wealthy family was torn apart by constant fighting. Her adoptive parents were cold and distant, and her brother bullied her relentlessly. In the end, they threw her out with nothing to her name.

My adoptive family was warm and loving. Then the young, wealthy heir fell in love with me, despite my simple background. It was like something straight out of a romance drama.

Consumed by jealousy and bitterness, my sister murdered me. Then, mysteriously, we both found ourselves back in time, to the very day we were adopted.

This time, she darted toward my old adoptive parents, a smug smile on her face. ""Dear sister,"" she sneered, ""I'll be the one living the fairy tale now."" 

But she never understood‚Äîa true heroine isn't made by wealth or status.

\*\*\*

My sister and I were reborn to the day we were adopted from the orphanage.  

In the director's office stood two families waiting to meet us‚Äîthe wealthy Brooks and the humble Rolands.

The Brooks were immaculately dressed. Mr. Brook wore a crisp business suit, while Mrs. Brook dazzled with her expensive jewelry. 

Their only son Hardy, though in his high school uniform, made sure to stand out with his globally limited-edition designer sneakers.

This was the most prestigious family in Mistwood. Jason Brook was a business mogul whose companies paid more taxes than any other in the city. His wife Rita was the queen of high society, a regular at jewelry auctions and charity galas where she rubbed shoulders with A-list celebrities.

Their son Hardy was Mistwood's crown prince‚Äîand everyone knew it.

In contrast, the Rolands looked plain and worn. Kyle and Daphne's hands were rough from manual labor, and though they wore what must have been their best clothes, faint sweat stains were still visible on the fabric.

They worked at Mistwood High‚Äîthe husband as a janitor, the wife as a cleaner.

In my previous life, Elva had rushed to the Brooks without a second thought. 

But this time was different. Before I could even move, she darted across the room and threw herself into Daphne's arms.

""Please,"" she begged, tears welling in her eyes, ""I want you to be my mom. Take me home with you!

""From now on, my name becomes Elva Roland!"" 

As my sister exclaimed excitedly, I walked toward the Brook Family. 

With our choices made, we were each taken away by our new families.

On our way out, I caught the director's puzzled whispers to herself. ""This is so strange. Elva has always been competitive and picky. She used to turn her nose up at any potential parents who dressed modestly. Yet today, with the Brooks right there in their designer clothes, she picks the Rolands?""

The director didn't understand why. But I did.

Chapter 2

In my past life, my sister had jumped at the chance to be adopted by the Brooks. She'd been so sure that wearing the Brook name would transform her into a princess, especially with the handsome Hardy Brook as her new brother.

She'd imagined it would be like those romance novels she loved‚Äîthe privileged heir and his beautiful adopted sister living under the same roof, gradually falling in love with each other. 

But Hardy was far from the caring brother Elva had hoped for. Instead, his contempt for her was immediate and cruel.

""I despise social climbers more than anything,"" he'd sneered. ""Don't think I can't see through you‚Äîyou're just another gold digger pretending to be sweet and innocent, hoping to get your hands on our family's money.""

At home, Hardy made Elva's life miserable. At school, he and his gang of followers turned bullying her into a sport. Even when Jason and Rita knew about it, they'd only give Hardy a half-hearted scolding.

Truth was, they never really cared for Elva. The only reason they adopted her was because a fortune teller had told Jason that taking in a daughter would bring him good luck for the next decade.

When push came to shove, they always sided with Hardy. After all, he was their flesh and blood, and Elva was just a name on adoption papers.

While Hardy tormented Elva at school, he treated me‚Äîthe Roland's adopted daughter‚Äîcompletely differently. 

He admired how I juggled everything: maintaining straight A's, earning scholarships, and still helping Mom with her cleaning job every night. I never complained about our modest life, and that seemed to fascinate him.

""Christine Roland,"" he'd say, his voice softening whenever he spoke my name. ""Now there's a girl who knows the meaning of hard work."" 

Just like every clich√© romance novel, the privileged bad boy found himself drawn to the hardworking girl from the wrong side of the tracks.

Later, when his parents passed away, Hardy brought in a team of lawyers during the inheritance dispute. Through careful manipulation, he left Elva with absolutely nothing‚Äîshe was forced out of the family without a single penny to her name.

A few months later, Hardy married me. At our wedding, he even declared to everyone: ""Christine, everything I have is yours now.""

But I never got to enjoy any of it. A few days after the wedding, Elva‚Äîdriven mad with jealousy and despair‚Äîran me over with her car.

In this second chance at life, my sister didn't hesitate to choose the Rolands.

Though they weren't wealthy, there was no family drama or scheming. She could grow up with parents who gave her their unconditional love.

And with this humble background, she knew Hardy would cherish and protect her, eventually leading to a fairy-tale wedding.

She smiled at me and said, ""Christine, this time, I'll be the leading lady in the fairy tale.

""Now it's your turn to¬†get a taste of everything I went through.""

Chapter 3

Elva was right. In fact, Hardy's bullying started even earlier than in my past life.

At school, they shoved my head into the sink while boys snickered around me.

Just as my lungs screamed for air, someone yanked me up by my neck. Hardy stood there, smiling coldly.

""Want our family's money? Sure, I'll share,"" he sneered. ""Drink from the toilet bowl. Each gulp gets you a hundred grand. What do you say?""

His gang of followers hooted and cheered.

I stared at Hardy.

He'd once whispered sweet declarations of love to me in my previous life. Now, he was directing all his spite and venom at me.

Hardy's eyes didn't even register my presence, instead focusing on something behind me. I knew without turning that it was Elva, hunched over as she mopped the floor.

""Is that Elva? Why is she cleaning?"" Hardy asked.

""Oh, her mom's the school cleaner,"" one of his friends replied. ""She goes to class during the day and helps her mom with cleaning at night.""

A flicker of surprise crossed Hardy's eyes, followed by a glimmer of pity. 

""Hey!"" he called out to Elva. ""It's freezing out here. Nobody's checking anyway, just leave it.""

Elva straightened up, her dark hair falling over her shoulders, determination written across her delicate face.

""I can't,"" she shook her head. ""If someone inspects and finds the floor dirty, Mom will lose a hundred dollars from her paycheck.

""I know that's nothing to someone like you, but for my family? That's my entire week's worth of food.""

Without another word, she bent down and kept scrubbing.

Elva's scheme was obvious. Out of all the floors she could clean, she deliberately chose to work right in front of Hardy. 

She had even let her hair down and positioned herself carefully to show off her best angles.

And of course, Hardy fell for it completely.

As expected, Hardy rushed forward and helped Elva up, snatching the rag from her hands and tossing it to his followers.

""You guys finish cleaning the rest,"" he ordered.

Noticing her hands reddened from the cold, he draped his jacket over her shoulders.

""It's so late. How are you getting home?""

""By bike,"" she replied quietly.

""Bike? In this weather?"" Hardy looked shocked. ""No way. Wait downstairs‚ÄîI'll have my driver take you home.""

Hardy led Elva away with his arm protectively around her shoulders.¬†She glanced back discreetly and flashed me a mocking smile.

Moments later, everyone had left, leaving me alone by the sink.

I struggled to my feet, using my sleeve to wipe the water dripping from my hair.

""Here, use this.""

A cool voice spoke behind me.

I turned around to see Shirley, our class president, standing beside me with a clean towel in her hand.

She was a quiet girl who studied diligently, always wearing long sleeves regardless of the season.

In my previous life, I'd seen her try to help Elva during similar bullying. She'd offered a towel then too, suggesting Elva report Hardy's behavior.

But Elva had just slapped her hand away. ""You don't understand anything! He's my brother!""

I suppose Elva was still hoping to make Hardy fall for her back then.

After that incident, Shirley stopped getting involved and went back to her solitary ways.

Then, just before graduation, Shirley took her own life.

Only then did we learn the dark truth‚Äîher family was desperately poor, her grandmother bedridden, and her father a gambling addict who not only abused her but planned to sell her to pay off his debts.

Now here she was‚Äîthe same girl who took her own life in my past life‚Äîstanding beside me with a clean towel in her hands.

I hesitated before taking it.

Without a word, she turned and walked away.

She probably thought there was nothing worth saying to someone like me‚Äîa Brook kid.

As I watched her figure about to disappear, I suddenly called out, ""Shirley!"" 

She stopped in her tracks. 

I scratched my head awkwardly. ""Um, I just transferred here and don't know my way around yet.""

""Could you show me where the cafeteria is?""

The cafeteria counter displayed today's lunch options. 

There was a steaming tray of mac and cheese, crispy chicken tenders, fresh garden salad, loaded baked potatoes, and hearty tomato soup. 

Typical fare for Mistwood High- the most prestigious high school in town, where even the cafeteria food was a cut above the rest.

I ran my fingers through my hair, feigning embarrassment. ""Oh, I grabbed way too much food."" I paused, glancing at her. ""It'd be a shame to waste it. You haven't eaten dinner yet, have you? Join me?""

After a long hesitation, Shirley picked up her fork and began taking small, careful bites.

I stared at her thin wrist peeking out from her school uniform sleeve, all bones and no flesh.

Girls like Shirley were the invisible ones who actually needed help. 

But they weren't pretty enough to turn heads or dramatic enough to draw attention. Instead, they just faded into the background of our high school years, like wallflowers never getting their moment to bloom.

In this life, I was determined to save not only myself but her as well.

My mind made up, I spoke,¬†""Ugh, these conic sections are impossible! I can't understand a thing...Hey Shirley, since you're so good at math, why don't you tutor me?""

Shirley froze mid-chew, her eyes wide with disbelief as if saying, 'since when were we this close?'

I didn't give her a chance to refuse.

Throwing my arm around her shoulders, I cheerfully declared, ""Then it's settled! Don't worry, I'll pay you for the lessons!""

I handed Shirley an envelope, casually saying, ""Consider it an advance payment for tutoring.""

She stared at the hundred bills inside, momentarily stunned into silence.

The Brooks had always been generous with their adopted daughter's allowance, both in my previous life and now. What was merely pocket money to Hardy could help Shirley buy her grandmother's medicine, cover hospital expenses, and even rent a small off-campus apartment away from her abusive father.

After setting up tomorrow's tutoring session with Shirley, I headed home.

The luxurious mansion was empty. Jason was out at a business dinner, and Rita was at the beauty salon. 

As for Hardy, he was probably having dinner at the Rolands. 

Just like in my previous life, when his driver had dropped me off, the Roland parents had spotted him and eagerly insisted he stay for dinner.

Like a scene from a typical drama, that dinner gave the young man, who'd grown up in a cold, wealthy household, a taste of the warmth found in a humble family.

The Roland parents' genuine, warm smiles, and their small, worn-down but cozy home filled with life, made Hardy yearn for such simplicity. It only made him more drawn to the modest girl who grew up in this loving environment.

At this moment, he and Elva were likely sharing a simple meal together, both content and happy despite the modest fare.

I changed into my Herm√®s robe, washed my face with Chanel cleanser, and sipped the gourmet truffle soup the housekeeper had brought up. A cold smirk tugged at the corner of my mouth.

What no one knew was that while the Roland parents were indeed poor, they were far from the simple, honest people they appeared to be.

The couple strongly favored sons over daughters and had originally wanted to adopt a boy. When they couldn't find a non-disabled boy at the orphanage, they settled for a pretty girl instead, hoping she'd attract a wealthy husband someday.

When they saw Hardy bringing their daughter home, the couple could barely contain their excitement. They immediately seized the opportunity to invite this potential wealthy son-in-law inside, treating him with exaggerated hospitality.

All that family warmth and homely atmosphere was nothing but an act. After all, this staged display of simple family life was all they had to entice a young master from a wealthy family.

In my previous life, when I told them I didn't want to marry Hardy, my adoptive parents turned violent. Daphne locked me in my room while Kyle brutally beat me with a table leg and his belt until I was barely conscious.

Elva believed she'd found her paradise in this life, unaware that true heaven doesn't exist in this world.

The Brooks were hell masked by wealth, while the Rolands were hell hidden beneath poverty.

To escape hell, one must rely on their own strength and cunning.

Over the next few days, Hardy's cruelty escalated.

Each time I opened my lunch box from the housekeeper, I discovered it filled with thumbtacks.

Dead spiders appeared in my facial cleanser and toothpaste.

My dresses hung in the closet, marred by cigarette burns.

Whenever I looked up in horror, I'd catch Hardy's satisfied, malicious smile.

He would silently mouth the words: ""Christine, you deserve this.""

Hardy thought I would cry. 

Instead, I calmly dumped out the thumbtacks, tossed the spider into the trash, and neatly folded my dress away.

His smirk faded.

Glaring at me, he growled through gritted teeth, ""Let's see how long you can keep up this act.""

Fortunately this time, although I had to endure Hardy's malice, all the resources of the Brook Family were at my disposal. 

I no longer had to spend my days at school and nights being forced to help my adoptive mother with her cleaning job. 

I now had housekeepers catering to my every need, a chauffeur at my beck and call, and could focus completely on my studies.

In my previous life, I had to save for months to buy study materials, always hiding my money from Kyle who would steal it for alcohol and gambling.

Now, my closet was filled with designer dresses, and my jewelry box contained Van Cleef & Arpels and Cartier pieces‚Äîall casual gifts from Rita, without me spending a cent.

I received fifty thousand in cash allowance and a credit card with a hundred thousand limit at the start of each month. If I ran out, I just had to tell the housekeeper, and more money would be transferred to my account within thirty minutes.

The struggles I once faced were now Elva's burden to bear. 

I watched as she dozed off in class, knowing she spent her nights helping her foster mother with housework, leaving her constantly drained.

Gradually, she stopped doing homework and began turning in blank test papers. 

In my previous life, I'd pushed myself to the limit‚Äîsurviving on black coffee and even resorting to stabbing myself with a compass to stay awake while studying. 

But Elva, who'd lived her past life in luxury, had neither the drive nor the endurance to deal with the situation, not to mention that academic success had never even been on her radar.

In her calculating mind, marrying into the Brook family held far greater value than a Harvard acceptance letter.

So, Elva focused all her energy on making Hardy like her more. 

During math class, she'd ignore the lesson and write diary entries meant for Hardy to read.

She'd skip dance practice to sneak out with Hardy, driving to the outskirts to stargaze.

On the night before the dance performance...

She sat outside the practice room, crying.

I could tell Elva had studied how heroines cry in dramas‚Äîhead tilted at a perfect forty-five-degree angle, tears pooling in her eyes but never quite falling.

And that's exactly when Hardy happened to walk by. 

The moment Hardy asked what was wrong, Elva's long-restrained tears finally streamed down. 

She flung herself into his arms, sobbing, ""Hardy, I can't perform anymore!¬†Everyone else gets to be on stage except me... Christine won't let me participate...""

Hardy, who already despised me deeply, instantly flared up. ""Why?""

Elva bit her lip, desperately trying to stop crying, but still couldn't help whimpering, ""She said my mom is just a cleaner and my dad is just a janitor.¬†I can't even afford the performance costume, so I don't deserve to be on stage.""

Hardy's expression grew increasingly dark.

He gazed at the tearful Elva and said gently, ""It's just a performance costume. Let me buy it for you.""

Elva shook her head, playing her part of the innocent, virtuous girl perfectly. ""No, I couldn't. It's eight hundred dollars‚Äîthat's too expensive a gift to accept.""

""How dare she?"" Hardy's fists clenched, his sympathy for Elva turning to rage against me.

Elva shook her head tearfully. ""After all, she's your sister, she's a Brook. Your family donated multiple buildings to the school, and your father sits on the board. Even if the teachers knew about her bullying, what could they do about it?""

Elva hadn't noticed the reporter who was passing by, on campus for an interview. 

Like a shark sensing blood, the reporter leaned in and asked eagerly, ""Bullying? What bullying?""

Things suddenly escalated from there.

The school's largest conference room was filled to capacity. Everyone was there‚Äîthe principal, vice principal, academic director, and homeroom teacher. Newspaper reporters crowded one side, while both the Brook and Roland families occupied the other.

Kyle and Daphne stood protectively beside the tearful Elva in one corner of the conference room, their faces full of grievance and anger.

Jason and Rita initially dismissed the call about my troubles at school. 

Only when they learned that the new Director of Education was present did they rush over. 

After all, Mistwood High was the city's top school and the Education Bureau's flagship institution.

Jason strode in confidently, greeting the Education Bureau Director like an old acquaintance. ""Director, I apologize that such a minor incident has taken up your time. You know how children are, just a simple misunderstanding...""

The Director cut him off firmly. ""Mr. Brook, I cannot dismiss bullying as a minor incident. Christine may be your daughter, but in this school, every student matters equally. They're all young minds we're shaping‚ÄîI won't allow any of them to be led astray.""

""Of course,"" Jason said with a forced smile, ""we're also unsure what happened. Please investigate thoroughly.""

He returned to Rita's side, and they exchanged a silent glance.

I understood. If the bullying allegations against me were confirmed, the Brook Family would immediately abandon me, their adopted daughter for whom they had little affection, and completely cut ties.

Jason and Rita's attitude was already cold, as for Hardy... he stood beside the continuously sobbing Elva, comforting her softly, occasionally lifting his dark eyes to give me a cold glance.

Seeing that everyone had arrived, the principal asked Elva, ""Miss Roland, please tell us what happened.""

Elva looked up with tear-stained eyes and quietly repeated her story to Hardy. 

The reporters were growing increasingly outraged, demanding justice.

One reporter stepped forward. ""According to our sources, Christine and Elva grew up together in the same orphanage‚Äîthey even called each other sisters. 

""Then Christine was adopted by the wealthy Brooks, while Elva went to a modest family of school staff. 

""Tell us, Christine, did your newfound wealth give you permission to bully your former sister and take what was rightfully hers?""

Silence fell.

The reporters' eyes were all fixed on me, the red lights of their cameras flashing continuously. Everyone wanted to dig up a sensational story. 

This was a highly sensitive social issue‚Äîin today's society, where social classes were becoming increasingly rigid, wealthy families taking educational opportunities away from underprivileged students would spark significant public outrage. 

Not to mention that the protagonists of this story, Elva and I, formed an extremely dramatic contrast.

In the pin-drop silence of the office, I suddenly burst out laughing, the sound jarring in the tense atmosphere. 

The reporters all looked at each other in confusion.

""Excuse me, but I thought news professionals needed to cross-verify and fact-check the information they receive,"" I said pointedly. ""What's this? Now you can skip work procedures just to rush out a sensational story?""

The reporter's face turned red. 

I stood up and coldly pointed at Elva. ""Right now she's the only source of information, and everything is just her one-sided account.""

I watched Elva, her face now pale from all the crying.

Once, I had truly thought of her as a sister. But in my previous life, she murdered me in a fit of jealousy. Now, in this life, she was plotting to rise up by destroying me. If I had to crush her now, she had no one to blame but herself.

""Since you asked, here's the truth. Elva's jealous of me. She thinks we started from the same place, and she was even prettier and smarter than I, so why should I have a better life than she? That jealousy drove her to make up this whole story about me.""

""That's not true, Elva..."" Hardy cut in sharply.

He was about to argue that Elva had willingly chosen the humble Roland family, proving she wasn't someone who chased wealth and looked down on poverty. He wanted to point out how I was twisting the truth.

But before he could finish, the principal's office door burst open. A thin figure stood in the doorway‚Äîshort-haired and quiet, as unassuming as a blade of grass.

Our homeroom teacher recognized her. ""Shirley? What are you doing here?""

In my previous life, Shirley had already taken her own life by this point. But now, she was alive. She walked into the room with steady steps and stood beside me.

""I'm here to testify,"" she said quietly.",1,1748863839.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I took the bait. I dropped everything and decided to help him, thought maybe this was my one last good deed before ghosting the internet for a while.

What do I get in return? Emotional blue balls and rage-bait.

Turns out, his big ‚Äúproblem‚Äù was that he confessed to a girl, got rejected (obviously), blocked her (because embarrassment), and then,¬†*months later,*¬†felt love again and wrote her a long-ass letter. She somehow forgives him and they start talking again. Fast forward a few more months, she starts pulling back (again, obviously), and he spirals like a baby bat dropped from a tree.

He vents to me about how she‚Äôs acting cold. Says she‚Äôs afraid of guys. Says she‚Äôs mostly alone in college. And this¬†*Romeo 2.0*¬†thinks she‚Äôs ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù My guy, she blocked you once, then barely tolerates you, take the L. Move on. Simple.

So I try giving him normal advice:

* Invite her for coffee with her BFF (who introduced them in the first place) so she feels safe.
* Start sending voice messages so she gets comfortable with his presence.
* Eventually confront her to get closure, whether it's yes or no, at least you stop being this clingy limpet on a rock.

He says no. Says it‚Äôs ""awkward."" Then hits me with¬†**‚ÄúWhat if she leaves me for a more handsome guy?‚Äù**

Bro. BRO. At that point, I transcended anger. I hit disappointment on a cosmic level. All that kindness I wasted. I wanted to slam my keyboard through the sun. This guy used emojis.¬†**In front of me.**¬†I felt like I needed bleach for my brain.

I insulted his intelligence, his fake gentleman behavior, the whole ""I‚Äôm nice so she should like me"" delusion. Then I blocked him.

Never again. Never f\*cking again.  
I don‚Äôt care how sad you sound. If your pain is rooted in some self-absorbed, lovesick fantasy where you‚Äôre the ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù who deserves a girl because you were polite once, get out. Take your therapist bait elsewhere.

I don‚Äôt want to love anyone anymore. I don‚Äôt want to hear anyone‚Äôs delusions about how they‚Äôre ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù or ‚Äúreal‚Äù or ‚Äúdeep.‚Äù You‚Äôre not deep. You‚Äôre not broken. You‚Äôre entitled. You just want someone to validate your obsession and call it ‚Äúlove.‚Äù

Thanks for wasting my time.  
And yeah, we happily blocked each other ever after.  
**The End.**

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


#### **1. DRZ - What I Do [absrd]**  
*Recommended if you like: Pirapus, Maze, Protostar*  

Since we've been doing this thing for quite some time now, we are able to look back on artist's journeys in ways we perhaps could not before. Every review a time capsule of the sound the featured talents were going for, the general landscape of what was popular in the scene, and the information available at the time. So while going back to an artist we've talked about before might seem redundant on paper, I think it can still offer a ton of value, from correcting past research mistakes (oopsie) to showcasing an artist's evolution. With that overly long justifaction out of the way, let's once again talk about **DRZ**!

**1.1. What He Has Been Doing (2023 - 2025)**

Like I hinted at above, we had talked about Reading-based talent _Matthew Montgomery_ already, for the sentence confuser that was [his 2023 EP _Better Off, The EP_](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/s/oEH4rUQdcs). In the meantime, more interviews with the acronymed lad surfaced, which allow me to expand on the brief intro a tad. For instance, it was his mate Sam, also known as underground machine _Apom_, that taught him how to DJ, on his Numark turntables! After learning said ropes, Matt enjoyed his very first set in 2019, at _The Alley_. Taking over from his friend, Matt even ran the local Drum and Bass society, which later grew into a whole 'nother Sussexian beast called _SB Audio_, which is still going strong today!

As he became more and more obsessed with his own productions, however, he left that life behind, and racked up uniquely melodic and furiously filthy releases all across the scene, with a work ethic that few people can match. Just in the time since our last peek at his discography, so from 2023 until today, he's slung out absolute tunes on _BeatsBassLife_, _NUFORM_, _Elevate_, _ProgRAM_, _Pull Up_, _Skankandbass_, _CRUCAST_, _Alpha Circuit_, _STMPD_ and _DnB Allstars_, collaborating with _Elder_, _Sam SHB_, _Jensk_, _Sub Zero_, _El Pablo_ and _Arcando_, becoming one of the most exciting names of the still ongoing wave of Melodic Jump Up Fusions, while also having his toes firmly and deeply buried in the waters of full-on techy smashers. 

**1.2. What I Do**

As mentioned in the above linked run-down, Matt has a habit of creating quite a ton of tunes, which he regularly shares in his _100% DRZ_ mixes. Since he saw himself experiment with his sound more than usual lately, the newest entry into this wonderful series, the _THIS IS DRZ_ mix from earlier this year, was absolutely jam-packed with explorations in every kind of direction, and a _particularly_ lovely tune that, alongside the stupidly good collab with the boi _Lukher_, was one of the main reasons I kept coming back to the mix: **What I Do**!

After months of teasing and (sometimes not so) patient waiting, this special tune finally makes its way onto the digital shelves, via newly-founded but already massive waves causing imprint **absrd**, reportedly working together with Universal, and showcasing DnB's more emotive sides with anthems by _Idle Days_, _Rendah_, _Maze_, and now also **DRZ**. So what _have_ we got here then? Wasting the least amount of time possible, this delightful one _immediately_ launches into the titular dreamy vocal, while the background sees various synth melodies float to the top. Before we even get a chance to recover from this sweetness, Matt ignites the fireworks of vocal choppery and incredibly pretty synths dancing on top of extra crunchy walls of bass, overloading the senses in the best way possible.

**1.3. Conclusion**

So full of gorgeous auditory imagery, while also reliably delivering on the lower ends - the corners of my mouth have never been more confused about which direction they should be pointing. The full D-RZenal on display.

---

#### **2. Farflow - Running Out EP [Midas Touch Recordings]**  
*Recommended if you like: S.P.Y, DKN, SubMarine*  

Next, two Belgian talents that have been consistently delivering incredible releases - multiple of which should have prompted me to feature them here already - and the newest results of their creative endeavours, which are simply so good I could not delay the inevitable any longer. Let's talk about **Farflow**! 

**2.1. Farfloduction**

As with any duo, telling the story of what both members have been up to over the years in a coherent way is a little hard, so fair warning, I'm going to have to jump around a bit. First, a brief introduction though. **Farflow** is made up of Belgian-Polish multi-instrumentalist and nowadays full-time producer **Raf Cyran** and Belgian guitarist-slash-HR-manager **Wolf Logist**. After initially meeting, but not really _meeting_, back in primary school (!), they did eventually hit it off when they were put into a class together in high school. Bonding over their shared love for Blink-182 et al., they first jammed together, and were then violently pulled into the wild world of electronic music through the unstoppable uprising of Dubstep in the early 2010s, which not only inspired Raf to start getting into DJing and eventually peer-pressure Wolf to join in on the fun, but also lead them to try out this production thing as well. However, they were also active behind the scenes, with both of them acting as label and artist manager for _10|10_ - but what about the music?

Well, before we get into that shared project, we need to get the personal projects and backstories out of the way.

**2.1.1. Lupine Logististics**

Okay, I have to admit my research didn't unearth all that much about Wolf, which, by the way, is like the coolest name ever. Since his day job is in HR, starting as a consultant and now having climbed up all the way up to manager status, most of his musical creative juice has been flowing right into the project we will soon enough talk about, but there are _some_ tidbits. For instance, his journey into music began when his mom bought him his first guitar at 13! Just three years later, he was already convinced by Raf to add decks to his instrumental arsenal - and the rest is Farflow history. 

Alright, so if I've got nothing for Wolf, how about his partner in crime?

**2.1.2. The Craftsman With Cyrange**

By nature of his day job in music, there's just way more projects I can point to in Raf's non-Farflow-ian journey, a lot of which also have separate artist bios, which in turn gave me more backstory ammunition for this paragraph! It all began when Raf was gifted a drum kit at age _five_, and it quickly spiralled into him playing drums, the guitar and bass in Punk Rock and Metal bands, percussioning in _Jazz_ ensembles, playing Timpani - which, after looking it up, is also a kind of (big) drum - in a full-blown orchestra, and even hitting the synth keys in a not so easily findable hyperpop group. Whew! Trying out various occupational avenues in the music industry, Raf was not only very active behind the scenes, running _Cyran Records_ and _10|10_, and even writing recommendational editorials and interviewing the likes of _Isha_ and _San Holo_ for _CHASE_ magazine, he also spread his production wings far and wide, from his collabrorative **Boshra** project with his brother Ben and vocalist _Dina Boshra_ to (co-)production work for names like _Ruby Grace_, _AYRA_, _Kastaar_, _As Echoes Fade_, and _Second Opinion_. He's even had a hand in an Eurovision entry! Plus, he and his wife recently opened a plant based bakery called _CABO_! I told you there was a lot to cover!

Enough about these side quest though, let's cover some **Farflow** grounds!

**2.2. Fokuzzing On The Main Project (2016 - 2025)**

While the Farflow journey was officially kicked off in 2016 with their debut EP on Raf's own label _Cyran_, and quickly followed up with the _El Dorado_ EP on Fokuz' _Influenza_ in 2017, it would still take a few years for the heads to _really_ turn. Sure, there were still singles here and there keeping the project chugging along, but the breakthrough that put them onto even my, at the time still very spotty, radar was their 2019 extended player, _Soul Drifts_, featuring an at the time very much up-and-coming _Duskee_. What originally started as just a one-off writing sesh for the MC, was quickly expanded into a double single on request by the Belgian duo, and thanks to some more pressure from Fokuz' label head, turned into a whole six-tracker, full of lush pianos and incredible flows. That's far from all they had in store of us with the project though!

Over the course of a whole stream of EPs on _Fokuz_, they already laid out the various directions they wanted to take us into, which not only eventually brought them onto the stages of the legendary Sportpaleis for Rampage's indoor festival, as part of a _Radar Records_ showcase with _Basstripper_ and _Maze_, and even _Tomorrowland_, as part of the _Andromedik Invites_ stage, but also lead to them releasing on the likes of _Skankandbass_, _Abyssal_ and **Midas Touch**, which is also where this particularly crunchy EP is released on. Wait, but what _is_ a Midas Touch?

**2.3. Midas Touch Recordings (2020 - 2025)**
 
Inspired by and aspiring to posess the same touch of gold as the Greek mythologyian King Midas, **Midas Touch Recordings** is a Belgian imprint for the deeper, and even occasionally techier side of DnB. After floating the idea of running a label together for years, long-time friends **S**tijn **V**an **B**uynder and Tom **Scepticz** Cools finally took the plunge in one fateful evening, after a few Grimbergen beers, and by 2020, the idea became real! With high-class art direction by Christina aka (formerly?) _Grizzlyarts Illustration_, a consistently great quality of music and, thanks to the extensive artist network they have built up over the years as solo artists, a steady stream of artists to feature, Midas quickly became a household name, fulfilling their original missions of acting as a springboard for underground artists multiple times over. 

While the duo regularly appears on the label themselves, at first as just SVB & Scepticz, but since 2024 also with their new project **MIDAS**, it also hosts a variety of artists like _SubMarine_, _Revan_, _Solace_, _One87_, _Easy_, _Teej_, _M-Zine_, _Ninive_, _Dunk_, _Kolectiv_, _Scurrow_, _Lavance_, and even _Telm & Wilson_, which, alongside their impressive VA compilations, not only lead to a nomination for _Best Label_ at the _Drum&BassArena_ awards in both 2021 and 2022, but also to multiple bookings under _Midas Touch sound-system_ banner. However, running a label can be a bit overwhelming, and often drowns out personal projects, like the aforementioned _MIDAS_, which is why this release is actually one of the last few before the label enters an extended hiatus - almost missed my window there! 

**2.4. Running Out EP**

So, as the clock on Midas is, until further notice at least, **Running Out**, let's finally talk about this Farflow EP! We open into this five-tracker with the rave-y journey that is **Loving You**, raising our collective heart rates with synthsects flying all around our ears and forcing us into dance with truly monstrous basses, before eventually calming down with its breakdown pianos evolving into liquid lushness, while the now sweet and smooth tamed basslines frolick underneath. Already on edge, title track **Running Out**'s growing, growling intro almost gives us a full-on panic attack, before unleashing the meaty, weighty stepper riddim's they've got in store for us, burrowing themselves deep into your skull. Super cool guitar outro as well! 

With our heart now fully arrhythmic, the duo completely throws us off the normal syncopation rhythm with the jungly one-two-three pounder that is **Simple**. Chock-full of rave-related sound effects, from sirens to rewinds, and elevated by the great MC vocal sample, it's already quite the fun romp like that, but then they go on further and entirely switch out the snare, and even throw us into 4x4 madness later on! Now that we got our rhythm thoroughly reset, we **Run It Back** to a proper stompy, _stupidly_ large smasher on the fourth stop, that not only smacks you across the face every 0.3 seconds, it also scratches the insides of your brain folds in ways you've never experienced with an absolutely _disgusting_, scritchy synth - what a banger. Lastly, we roll into the dreamy night with the jungly roller that is **Nightlock**, perfectly weaving together a whole assortment of different samples, beeps, horns, and think break whoop's. 

**2.5. Conclusion**

Blending together oldschool rave influences with their trademark precise heavyweight production, these two bring us the full spectrum of energy, from hectic madness to (far-)flowery vibes. Big!

1l1fgje,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l1fgje,The Haunting Disappearance of Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon: A Decade-Old Mystery That Still Chills Me to the Bone,"Hey r/mystery, buckle up because I‚Äôm diving deep into a very creepy case I come across, the disappearance of Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon in Panama, 2014. This case has everything: a remote jungle, eerie photos, cryptic phone logs, and a trail of clues that just don‚Äôt add up. I‚Äôve spent quite some time pouring over sources, from Wikipedia to obscure blogs like Imperfect Plan, to piece this together. I‚Äôm no expert, just a true crime nerd who can‚Äôt stop thinking about this one. Let‚Äôs get into it, and I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts at the end.

Kris Kremers, 21, and Lisanne Froon, 22, were two Dutch students from Amersfoort, Netherlands, who seemed like the kind of people you‚Äôd want to grab a coffee with. Kris was creative and responsible, just finished her studies in cultural education, while Lisanne was an optimistic volleyball player with a degree in applied psychology. They‚Äôd been roommates, worked together at a caf√©, and saved up for six months for their big adventure: a six-week trip to Panama to volunteer, learn Spanish, and soak up the culture. Sounds like the perfect post-grad plan, right?

They landed in Panama on March 15, 2014, and spent two weeks exploring tourist spots before heading to Boquete, a picturesque mountain town in Chiriqu√≠ province, about 37 miles from Costa Rica. Boquete‚Äôs known for its cool climate, lush forests, and the El Pianista trail, a popular hike near the Baru volcano. They moved in with a host family on March 29, planning to volunteer at a local school. But when they got there, the school wasn‚Äôt ready for them, leaving them with some unexpected free time. So, on April 1, 2014, around 11 a.m., they decided to hike the El Pianista trail, a supposedly easy 5 to 6 hour round trip with stunning views. They took the host family‚Äôs dog, Azul, and posted on Facebook about grabbing brunch with two Dutch guys before heading out. That was the last anyone heard from them.

The El Pianista trail isn‚Äôt some death trap; it‚Äôs a well-trodden path leading to a scenic lookout. Locals and tourists hike it all the time. Kris and Lisanne set off in broad daylight, and some sources say the restaurant owners got worried when Azul came back alone that night. The girls missed a scheduled tour with a guide the next morning, April 2, which raised the alarm. By April 3, locals organized searches, and by April 6, the girls parents flew to Panama with Dutch detectives, tracker dogs, and a $30,000 reward for any leads. Despite helicopters, ground teams, and dogs trained to pick up scents for up to nine days, the jungle gave up nothing. The rainy season had started, turning the terrain muddy and treacherous with cliffs, steep drops, and fast-moving rivers.

Weeks turned into months. No trace of Kris or Lisanne. Then, ten weeks later, on June 14, a local Ngobe woman found a blue backpack near a riverbank by her village, Alto Romero, about 8 hours‚Äô walk from the trail‚Äôs summit. The backpack, believed to be Lisanne‚Äôs, was a goldmine of clues: $83 in cash, Lisanne‚Äôs passport, a water bottle, two bras, two pairs of sunglasses, and, most crucially, their phones and Lisanne‚Äôs Canon Powershot SX270 HS camera. Everything was dry and in good condition, which raised some eyebrows. How does a backpack stay pristine after weeks in a jungle?

Here‚Äôs where it gets really unsettling. The phones, a Samsung Galaxy SIII (Lisanne‚Äôs) and an iPhone 4 (Kris‚Äôs), showed a desperate attempt to get help. Starting just six hours into their hike on April 1, they made 77 calls to 112 (international emergency number) and 911 (Panama‚Äôs emergency line). Only one call connected, for two seconds, before dropping. Calls continued over the next few days, but by April 6, Lisanne‚Äôs phone died. Kris‚Äôs phone was turned on and off sporadically until April 11, with several failed attempts to unlock it using an incorrect PIN. Was Kris trying to use it? Or someone else?

The camera was even weirder. It had normal vacation photos from April 1, showing the girls smiling, exploring the trail. But then, on April 8, between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m., 90 photos were taken in pitch darkness, most using flash. These are haunting: random shots of rocks, trees, a ravine, and one of the back of Kris‚Äôs head, possibly with blood in her hair. Another shows their belongings laid out on a rock, like someone was taking inventory. There‚Äôs also a missing photo, file #509, deleted from the SD card, which experts say would‚Äôve required a computer. Why delete one photo and leave the rest?

Around the same time as the backpack‚Äôs discovery, Kris‚Äôs denim shorts were found on a rock near the Culebra River, about 5 miles from the trail‚Äôs summit. Contrary to rumors, they weren‚Äôt neatly folded or zipped; they were wet and worn. Two months later, a boot with a foot inside and a pelvis were found nearby. DNA confirmed they belonged to Lisanne. Over time, at least 33 scattered bones were recovered, some identified as Kris‚Äôs and Lisanne‚Äôs, plus remains from three unknown individuals. Lisanne‚Äôs bones had some flesh, suggesting natural decomposition, but Kris‚Äôs were stark white, possibly bleached by the sun or something else. A forensic anthropologist found no scratches or marks on the bones, ruling out animal attacks or human tampering. Only about 10% of Lisanne‚Äôs and 5% of Kris‚Äôs remains were ever found, making a cause of death imposible to determine.

 Accident, Foul Play, or Something Else?

The official story from Panamanian authorities is that the girls got lost, fell from a cable bridge, and were swept away by a river. Dutch authors Marja West and J√ºrgen Snoeren, in their 2021 book Lost in the Jungle, back this up, arguing flash floods common in the rainy season made foul play unlikely. They think the girls kept walking the wrong way, got disoriented, and succumbed to the elements. The night photos could be them signaling for help or marking their location.

But a lot doesn‚Äôt add up. Why no messages or videos on their phones to explain their situation? Why was Kris‚Äôs phone turned on days after Lisanne‚Äôs died, with wrong PIN attempts? How did the backpack end up so far away, in good condition? And what‚Äôs with the bleached bones? Some suspect foul play. Theories range from organ trafficking to a serial killer, with locals pointing fingers at a tour guide named Feliciano Gonzalez or a youth gang called Pandilla, though no evidence ties them directly to the case. A taxi driver, Leonardo Arturo Gonz√°lez, who drove the girls to the trail, drowned mysteriously in 2015, fueling speculation.

Others wonder about environmental factors. The jungle‚Äôs brutal: flash floods, steep cliffs, and disorienting terrain could‚Äôve overwhelmed them. But the night photos and the backpack‚Äôs condition make a simple ‚Äúlost‚Äù story feel incomplete. Some more out there theories even toss around paranormal ideas or links to Missing 411 cases, though that‚Äôs a stretch without evidence

I can‚Äôt stop thinking about those night photos. Imagine being lost in a jungle, in the dark, maybe injured, taking pictures of nothing but rocks and trees. Were they trying to signal a helicopter? Document their last moments? Or was someone else holding the camera? The fact that so little of their remains were found, and the weird state of Kris‚Äôs bones, just makes my skin crawl. Plus, the Panamanian police got a lot of flak for mishandling the case, like not securing the trail early on or following up on local leads.

This case hits hard because Kris and Lisanne were just two young women chasing a dream, like so many of us. They weren‚Äôt reckless; they were prepared, excited, and full of life. Yet the jungle swallowed them, leaving only fragments and questions. I keep wondering what happened betwen those happy April 1 selfies and those creepy April 8 photos. Did they get lost and panic? Did someone find them? Or is there a truth we‚Äôll never know?

I‚Äôm torn. Most of me leans toward an accident, because the jungle‚Äôs brutal and flash floods are no joke. But the backpack, the PIN attempts, and those photos scream something weirder. What‚Äôs your take? Do you buy the official story, or do you think there‚Äôs more to it? Any theories on what photo #509 mightve show? Also, if you want to dig deeper, check out the Lost in Panama podcast or the Still Lost in Panama book by Christian Hardinghaus and Annette Nenner. They‚Äôve got some fresh angles.

Instead, I spend my days roaming more rural parts of Bali. I meet locals and show interest in them and their life. And they let me in, they share stories with me, invite me to ceremonies or a good Bali kopi.

I took the bait. I dropped everything and decided to help him, thought maybe this was my one last good deed before ghosting the internet for a while.

What do I get in return? Emotional blue balls and rage-bait.

Turns out, his big ‚Äúproblem‚Äù was that he confessed to a girl, got rejected (obviously), blocked her (because embarrassment), and then,¬†*months later,*¬†felt love again and wrote her a long-ass letter. She somehow forgives him and they start talking again. Fast forward a few more months, she starts pulling back (again, obviously), and he spirals like a baby bat dropped from a tree.

He vents to me about how she‚Äôs acting cold. Says she‚Äôs afraid of guys. Says she‚Äôs mostly alone in college. And this¬†*Romeo 2.0*¬†thinks she‚Äôs ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù My guy, she blocked you once, then barely tolerates you, take the L. Move on. Simple.

So I try giving him normal advice:

* Invite her for coffee with her BFF (who introduced them in the first place) so she feels safe.
* Start sending voice messages so she gets comfortable with his presence.
* Eventually confront her to get closure, whether it's yes or no, at least you stop being this clingy limpet on a rock.

He says no. Says it‚Äôs ""awkward."" Then hits me with¬†**‚ÄúWhat if she leaves me for a more handsome guy?‚Äù**

Bro. BRO. At that point, I transcended anger. I hit disappointment on a cosmic level. All that kindness I wasted. I wanted to slam my keyboard through the sun. This guy used emojis.¬†**In front of me.**¬†I felt like I needed bleach for my brain.

I mocked, his fake gentleman behavior, the whole ""I‚Äôm nice so she should like me"" delusion. Then I blocked him.

Never again. Never f\*cking again.  
I don‚Äôt care how sad you sound. If your pain is rooted in some self-absorbed, lovesick fantasy where you‚Äôre the ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù who deserves a girl because you were polite once, get out. Take your therapist bait elsewhere.

I don‚Äôt want to love anyone anymore. I don‚Äôt want to hear anyone‚Äôs delusions about how they‚Äôre ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù or ‚Äúreal‚Äù or ‚Äúdeep.‚Äù You‚Äôre not deep. You‚Äôre not broken. You‚Äôre entitled. You just want someone to validate your obsession and call it ‚Äúlove.‚Äù

Thanks for wasting my time.  
And yeah, we happily blocked each other ever after.  
**The End.**

Edit: I listened to this guy for HOURS, before saying anything, and yeah, I know I am asshole for bashing him, but I felt so useless, he was like self-diagnosed person, I even asked him if he has any medical condition and bhal bhal blha bhal.

Let me start by saying that I (27F) really am blessed to have married into a very fun, nurturing family. I love them to death, but there are a few things that are really boiling over into my marriage. It mainly surrounds how time is spent on vacations.

 To try not to write a novel, here are the issues I have:

1. My husband (28M) and my FIL love to play golf. I used to find golf super boring, but their outings are very engaging and entertaining! My issue is that on every vacation we go on as a family, FIL monopolizes the time with golf. We will be told months leading up to it that this vacation is for us to spend time together as a group and with each other. I will say, my husband has cracked down on how much they golf on family trips.

2. This brings me to my 2nd issue. A lot of times their golfing coincides with when we need to check out of the hotel (we often times hotel hop on trips to see more of the location). It annoys me to no end to feel like I have to be the good little wife and pack my husband‚Äôs bags while they‚Äôre off golfing. I wouldn‚Äôt have an issue if it wasn‚Äôt so frequent. Whenever they go off to golf, my MIL, SIL, and I are left to figure out plans for ourselves, but making sure we have time to pack their bacgs before checkout.

3. My final issue, and this is the biggest to me, is that trips dedicated to spending time with my family are not respected. This past month we flew up for our niece‚Äôs graduation. My husband had already discussed with me that there was some business related work he wanted/needed to do with FIL and I was okay with that. I did warn him that I had a feeling that FIL would try to weasel his way into more of his time. Sure enough, leading up to the trip FIL kept trying to change plans with my family and extend his portion of the trip. To top it off, FIL kept trying to throw in 1 on 1 time between my husband and MIL. This is something I had pushed for on EVERY vacation with his family! I would ask him to at least go on a coffee date with MIL because he would spend most of the time with FIL. It pissed me off that when it‚Äôs a trip for my family, suddenly my husband needs 1 on 1 time with MIL. At one point I also found out that when FIL was telling me he didn‚Äôt want to drive in rush hour traffic, and that‚Äôs why he wanted to delay dropping my husband off at my sister‚Äôs (I had gotten picked up earlier in the day), it was actually so that he could sneak in golfing.

This all came to a head today because we were talking about another trip we have to take next month. It‚Äôs in the same area as my husband‚Äôs parents but this trip is not for them. I admittedly got fiery when talking about what happened on the last trip. I wasn‚Äôt intending to harp on the past, but more so explain the pattern of behavior to look out for in this next trip. I wholeheartedly believe that the past is the best indicator of future behavior. I think I also got upset because I feel like I never got a resolution. I had personally told FIL why the previous trip was so important to me and it seemed like he understood, only for him to continue to weasel more time. Admittedly, I also lectured him on making plans to spend a full day with his mother during our trip next month. I told him how unfair it is that MIL gets a measly coffee date while FIL gets multiple rounds of golf. I even suggested some activites he can plan. I also told him to message MIL about his intention of having a mother-son day so she can get excited and suggest ideas for plans. For good measure, I told him to start calling MIL once a week because it's also not fair that him and FIL talk multiple times a week but MIL gets the once in a blue moon phone call.

My husband doesn't do well with being lectured, which I admittedly tend to do because he'll either not respond to me or give me one worded answers. I tend to fill the silence because if I don't, my husband takes it as the end of the ""discussion"". When he called me out for lecturing him, I explained why I do that (not that it is an excuse) and then there was another long silence. At that point, I was frustrated and walked away to get ready for bed. He came in and asked ""You're not gonna say good night?"", and I then explained I'm tired of lecturing him.

He apologized and explained he didn't see this all as a big deal and he told me that he did in fact have discussions with his father about the excess golfing and leaving us to pack their bags. He tried to explain away the packing bag issue by saying his dad is older and he doesn't mean it. I got a little upset because if you say you had a discussion about it and he keeps doing it, does that not indicate intention? I also explained that of course it's not a big deal to him because he's not on the receiving end of it! I can admit that FIL has been better when it comes to their family vacations, but he showed no regard for my family time.

I also explained that what seems like me harping on the past is me listing out the behavior because I'm worried about the future. I suffer from anxiety and FIL's behavior isn't providing me any reassurance. What if we get pregnant, visit husband's family, and FIL decides to push him to play a round of golf and I go into labor? It sounds oddly specific but we had countless times in the past where my husband and FIL are unreachable on the course. What if we go on another family vacation with the kids; am I expected to play single mother while he gets to do stuff with his dad? When I explained all that, my husband shot me down saying ""You obviously don't know my dad well enough because he would never do that."" HOW WOULD I KNOW??? His behavior tells me that those scenarios are absolutely possible.

Towards the end of our discussion-turned-arguement, he asked me ""so what do you want me say? What boundaries do you want me to make?"" I went silent at that point because I don't want to bark orders, I want him to want to set boundaries. He told me since day one that he's always disliked that his family makes plans and that he's expected to roll with it. Why is it that when I want boundaries, I'm suddenly irrational and harping on the past?

I didn't grow up in the best living situation, so it was great to enter a family that accepted me.

Ngl this story isn‚Äôt that serous so take it w a grain of salt. This all started when I was drinking soda in the living room.

The cats spilled it on the floor. Now fyi I‚Äôm not blaming the cats in this case. Once she got home I got a lecture on how I shouldn‚Äôt have been drinking on the living room floor to begin with. I told her the rule was to not eat/drink on the couch not the floor. Then she told me what if it had spilled on the couch which imo irrelevant bcos it didn‚Äôt even touch the couch. She also said that her and my dad never do that. I pointed some times when she did infact drink on the floor. Her argument was that she only drank water but I pointed out that my dad regularly drinks coffee and chocolate milk on the floor so how is my case any different. She then argued that it I ws falling asleep I should have put it on the dining room table hard to do that when I had no idea I was bouta sleep.

A bit of context before the story: After months of searching, I (25M) was finally able to acquire a house. It required much construction... meaning that for the past months I have lived at home while doing construction in this house and will soon move out in a couple of weeks. Living at home is mostly okay but it had me wonder how I will remain communication with my parents. 

My parents do not have any hobbies, generally watch tv from 6pm till they go to bed. My dad also has had the same job for over 20+ years. It's their life so whatever makes them happy. However, due to them not having any hobbies or interests, I keep contact (even when living with them) to a minimum, I really don't know what to ask them about. Hobbies? None. Plans? Nope. Maybe something else they are planning to do this night? Not at the moment. 

Apart from that, I stopped telling them about much of what I do due to criticism. My dad especially has the tendency to judge me for choices I make. That is fine I guess, he can have his opinions, but it makes me less likely to open up. However, any criticism I have towards them, they cannot really handle. They can judge me life but I cannot judge theirs basically. Now that I am moving out, I do not really know how to maintain contact. How did you navigate this when moving out?

To give an example of communication and how it usually goes: I like coffee, and so I have been saving up for a lovely machine. When I was excited to tell him about it, he found my choices over the top, extravagant and weird. When I told him that his TV costs way more and that this is my money I earned, he got mad. 

Let me conclude by saying that they are not bad people. I know they care. But, their lives are lived through me since they don't have much going on, everything I do they wish to know, judge and influence. I cannot handle that and so I just don't know how to keep communication going when I live by myself. Please help. **Any advise is welcome.**",4,1748861987.0,raisedbynarcissists,3,1.0,False

In the dream, my house is under construction and this evening, I was playing cards with my cousins and a friend before we were all supposed to leave. They left and I stayed to to something that was supposedly important and ended up sleeping there unexpectedly. While sleeping there, i woke up and was affected by dozens of jinns. even saw the face of one, burnt out. my mother was there with me, and she was helping me navigate the house and was helping me gain control of myself as i was lucid. She too shared experience of how she dealt with them and that she has been experiencing similar for years (My mother IRL, was severely affected by Jinns in her late 20s/early 30s). My father (who passed away several years ago) was there as well, i didn't see him, but i know he was there. 

While my mother was helping me navigate, there were beds in the room i had the issue with mostly, beds i didnt see before and on each bed was a different jinn, affecting me in different ways, some were clawing, some were grabbing and pulling me down, some were numbing, some were loud and obscene and some where just touching gently (i was still repulsed even though it didn't actually inflict pain). The jinn whose face i saw, made coffee for my mother and another woman that was there (don't know who she was but apparently she was a relative). They had the coffee and I refused it, that's when I saw the jinn's face clearer. That was when I woke up. 

I honestly don't know what to make about this dream, i woke up feeling uneasy and a little terrified.

1l1eu30,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1l1eu30/the_difference_between_slowly_boiled_and_rapidly/,The difference between slowly boiled and rapidly boiled water.,"There can be a difference between slowly boiled and rapidly boiled water ‚Äî not in temperature per se, but in how water quality and temperature affect extraction and flavor.

‚∏ª

‚òï Key Differences for Coffee:

1. Oxygen Content
	‚Ä¢	Rapidly boiled water drives off more dissolved oxygen.
	‚Ä¢	Oxygen in water helps bring out coffee‚Äôs aroma and flavor nuances.
	‚Ä¢	Result: Water that‚Äôs been vigorously boiled may lead to flatter-tasting coffee.

Tip: Use freshly drawn cold water and bring it to just below a boil (90‚Äì96¬∞C) instead of letting it roll at full boil.

‚∏ª

2. Water Temperature
	‚Ä¢	Ideal coffee brewing temp: 90‚Äì96¬∞C (195‚Äì205¬∞F).
	‚Ä¢	If water is rapidly boiled and immediately used, it may be too hot ‚Äî leading to:
	‚Ä¢	Over-extraction (bitter taste)
	‚Ä¢	If water is slowly heated, it‚Äôs easier to control and stop it at the ideal brewing temp.

Note: Pour-over and French press methods benefit from this controlled temperature.

‚∏ª

3. Mineral Content
	‚Ä¢	Boiling water for too long (especially rapid boiling) can concentrate minerals as water evaporates.
	‚Ä¢	This may slightly alter taste and scale up your kettle over time.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Best Practice for Coffee:
	‚Ä¢	Use fresh, cold water (preferably filtered).
	‚Ä¢	Heat it until it just starts boiling, then cool it for 30 seconds before brewing.
	‚Ä¢	Avoid reboiling water or boiling it too aggressively.

‚∏ª

üìù Summary:

Factor	Slowly Boiled	Rapidly Boiled
Oxygen retention	Higher	Lower
Temperature control	Easier	Harder (can overheat)
Flavor impact	Better	Can be duller or bitter
Ideal for coffee?	‚úÖ Yes	‚ùå Not ideal unless cooled slightly

So, while both get you hot water, slow and controlled heating is better for preserving flavor and ideal extraction in coffee.",0,1748861180.0,pourover,2,0.1,False

I saw it happen just yesterday at the coffee shop. Someone accidentally brushed against another person, and the brusher quickly said, ""Oh, sorry!"" even though it was hardly their fault. This got me thinking about why saying sorry is such a reflex for us.

Like, is it a cultural thing? I feel like we're socially trained to be super polite, but maybe there's a psychological angle to it too. Could it be related to wanting to make peace or avoid conflict even in minor situations? I've heard it might be about maintaining social harmony, but I'm curious if anyone else sees it differently.

IDK, it just seems like we say sorry a lot, even when it's not really needed. I wonder if it's something more about managing our own anxiety in social settings? Like, saying sorry's kinda like assuring ourselves we're good-with-other-people material. üòÖ

Hi all,
Let me begin from starting it started almost 1.5 years back, i stood at 120 kgs totally ugly and introverted.  I was like okay, who cares. Due to friends influence i joined gym and tbh i started enjoying it. In 3 months i had lost 5 kgs but wasnt much happy, eventually my friends left and i was alone but as my membership wasn't finished so i was like ""chal hi lete hai"". 
I was never consistent so there was always ups and down, there was even a phase where i literally lost 15 kgs in 3 months. 
By October 2024, i stood at 95Kgs and literally everything changed for me, i became ambivert and started going out too often. Thats the place where everything started get bad. 
From November end 2024 i started taking everything for granted. No Diet, nothing. Chugging Beers, eating junk and all shit and worst even started skipping gym. 

Today :- 

Now today after break of 2 months, I am back at gym and weight almost 105 Kgs üò≠üò≠üò≠.
I genuinely need help and suggestion on how can i lose my weight and go back to double digits. 

My diet till now was:-

I was trying to skip breakfast (IF) but again i took it for granted and often did Swiggy and Zomato. 

I had a 250 ML Coke around 12 everyday.

My lunch was normal 3 chapatis sabji and Dal. 

Then at evening had some Namkeen like chakli or some shit and cold coffee.

And finally at night i had my dinner around 12-1 AM and dinner was Bread along with Soup. 



So now the main thing is I want suggestion how can i improve my diet and lose weight asap. I will be consistent in going to gym from now. 

My trainer said to switch chapati with steamed rice. So how much steamed rice should i take daily for losing weight? 100gm 200gm?

I would switch coke with diet coke. 

And strictly follow IF. 

Anymore hacks or suggestion to lost weight and get back to 95 asap would be appreciated. 

I am literally on the verge of crying all the hardwork of last 1.5 years went into vain.

1l1emy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1l1emy8/im_12_months_caffeine_free_it_all_started_on_this/,I‚Äôm 12 months caffeine free. It all started on this sub,"I was sick of living constantly with what I can only describe as a tiny nervous knot in the pit of my stomach. I woke with it there. It grew when I raced ahead in my mind into the awful non-existent future. It prevented me from going for certain jobs, air travelling, or to loud and crowded places, stunting my growth as a person. I had no sense of EASE in day to day living. In my mind disaster was always waiting for me. 

Then I found this sub and started to become persuaded by stories which at first sounded too good to be true. Could giving up caffeine ‚Äî which I consumed daily for over 2 decades ‚Äî kill my anxiety and irrational fear? 

I started tapering from my 3-5 cups a day. I found tapering hellish and someone on here advised to just jump off and go cold turkey. So in one sitting I listened to the audiobook by Allen Carr about giving up caffeine that day and I had my last coffee listening to that book. That was a game changer. Yes, headaches and fatigue come for a while but I barely remember it now. I know despite the fatigue I still exercised and found loads of energy about an hour after the workout. I needed paracetamol and ibruprofen every day for a while but headaches were WAY better than feeling fear. I‚Äôve never had any cravings since the day I gave up. Nothing could make me crave going back to anxiety. 

With caffeine out of my system I found that I could really start listening to my body now. I felt cut off from it before. I discovered 2 further things were causing me racing fragmented thoughts (but not full on fear like caffeine did). Artificial sweeteners and anything with cows milk. So I gave those up too and I feel like a different person. 

I now believe that anyone who suffers from any kind of mental health problem, anxiety or fear should have nothing to do with caffeine. When you really think about it, we get up every morning and ingest a psychoactive adrenal stimulant into our bodies before we even leave the house. It‚Äôs utterly insane. It‚Äôs a normalised insanity. Caffeine is a natural insecticide. When insects eat the plant, the drug literally attacks their nervous system and kills them by driving them nuts. How do we think it‚Äôs somehow ok for us??

My energy levels are now consistent. I rarely nap anymore. I get less tired in the gym and can go for longer. I think my hair is getting thicker. My left side hairline was regressing quickly but that is much less noticeable now. I never used to get compliments about my skin and now I do. A friend I saw last Tuesday who I hadn‚Äôt seen for 2 years says I look 10 years younger than when she last saw me. I said it must be caffeine but she batted it away as that‚Äôs one drug she is not prepared to give up! But I don‚Äôt preach. To each their own. 

In terms of the timeline of benefits, it‚Äôs the gift that keeps on giving. I felt a shift at week 2, 6, 12, 5 months, 9 months and even in the past 2 weeks. I shock myself when I strike up a conversation with a cashier in the supermarket, when I look people in the eye, when I actually take phone calls now rather than preferring to text. I‚Äôm just engaging with the world in a normal way and it‚Äôs so liberating. I‚Äôm travelling more (I used to have a fear of getting lost), doing things I used to avoid, living ‚Äî just living. In the past 12 months I flew to the other side of the world for a 6 week work contract. I never ever would have done that on caffeine. I‚Äôd needed to have been sedated for the flight alone. Or drunk. But I gave up drink years ago. Looking back on that I now think I was drinking to mask the fear induced through caffeine. If I could go back in time I‚Äôd probably have ditched caffeine first. Take away the drug *causing* the fear and maybe you no longer need the drug that *kills* the fear. You know?

Thanks everyone on this sub in the early days. I made to the 1 year mark. And I‚Äôll never go back.

Because I only put out positivity (or at least am constructive when there is negativity), my manager and I have an excellent working relationship, she tells me things (insider knowledge) and helps me to learn new skills. Unlike other members of the team I want to learn as much as I can and my manager has facilitated this and also signed off on me doing a management course that I asked to do. She revealed to me that she is struggling in the role and has begun reducing her hours. I see this as evidence that things are starting to shift.

On my management course, my tutor says she can see how much hard work I‚Äôm putting in and how my positive outlook is an asset. I have caught the attention of my department‚Äôs director, who has asked me to lead on projects, AND the CEO, who has sought my advice on issues. I don‚Äôt worry any more that I won‚Äôt progress, when the right opportunity presents itself I know it will be mine. My finances have vastly improved and I have a nice nest egg, but knowledge that should I fall on hard times I will absolutely be supported 100%. This was previously a massive fear of mine, but I am finding myself able to let go of that fear now.

This new focus on my working life has changed my state and I began interacting with my friends differently to how I had previously. Old contacts have reached out and I‚Äôve renewed friendships from decades ago. People reach out to me wanting to spend time with me, asking for my advice and guidance, or seeking comfort when they‚Äôve had a bad day and I‚Äôm happy to give them my support. It doesn‚Äôt drain me, it‚Äôs something that I am good at and enjoy doing. I feel abundant in my friendships currently. I'm attracting friendship all the time. Today I had 4 friends reach out to me before 11am. I've never had this kind of thing before.

Just over a week ago, I had a bit of a curveball. I have not been actively manifesting love, but I remain open to it. My feeling is if I increase my vibration, I will attract only good things that are meant for me. In fact, this is pretty much one of my affirmations. Anyway, someone who I have had a crush on for a long time (years) but never entertained as a potential partner asked for my number. I was shocked, but gave it. Stupidly I didn‚Äôt take his and of course, now he hasn‚Äôt messaged. I‚Äôm wondering what this was all about, because I should only be attracting what I truly deserve. He works in a shop I only have cause to go into once or twice a year. On my way there I had imagined us having a conversation about how I hadn‚Äôt been in for a year and how he wanted to see me more, but me joking that I wouldn‚Äôt recommend visiting me at my workplace, as I work in a hospital. Anyway I got there and while the conversation didn‚Äôt exactly go like that, he expressed disappointment at not having seen me since last Summer, and how he‚Äôd hoped to maybe see me out and about in town, which I don‚Äôt really do. So he asked me to coffee instead.

Now, there could be any number of reasons he didn‚Äôt message ‚Äì lost my number, misread my writing, changed his mind etc. But I feel like I inadvertently manifested that conversation and am trying to work out what the universe is trying to tell me here. I‚Äôve yet to manifest any contact from him, and initially I was very caught up in that ‚Äúwhy hasn‚Äôt he messaged‚Äù mindset. Now I‚Äôm thinking the timing just isn‚Äôt right yet and it will all unfold in time as it meant to. People have suggested finding a way to go back to his shop ‚Äì breaking the item he would have to fix for me, but that would be expensive and I feel, forcing the issue. They say to track him down and follow him on social media or DM him, but I think that would be kind of creepy as our relationship thus far has been flirty but professional. So I‚Äôm detaching from it. If it‚Äôs a right, an opportunity will present that will take me into his vicinity, if not his shop. But equally, what if this is the universe throwing a distraction my way? Does this happen? I want to see the positives and opportunity for growth from this but I am struggling at the moment. I guess it has been a boost that I am desired and sought out as a potential romantic partner as well as for friendships, and it has made me look at myself a bit more confidently than I already was ‚Äì I‚Äôm not just good at work and friendships, but I am worthy of love too. But I feel like I‚Äôve always known that and have told myself that the right person will accept me for who I am, with all my quirks and idiosyncrasies. I've not been short of offers in the past but always felt they weren't the right kind of offers. What point is the universe trying to make here? What is the lesson? Any insight from others would be very much appreciated. üôè Thank you xxx",2,1748860421.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False

I was solo flooring during rush hour at evening. We had drive through closed. Customer calls store today to talk to a manager. Tell her that I am a shift supervisor, and how can I help you? She says that she was not greeted at the register, and that the girl threw her change at her. Then her straw was thrown at her. Lastly that her frappe was very watery.  I told her that I am sorry, and we can remake it. Recovery mode. 

I remember taking her. I always say hi, what can I get you? She had her hand out to take the change, as I was dropping it onto her palm some coins hit the counter instead of her hand. I had tossed the straw onto the counter and it apparently slid off the counter. She asked if she can get a new one. I said yes, and that it apparently slid off the counter.

Other things that day. Guy comes up to ask me where his drink is that he has been waiting for 30 minutes. I told him that I just got here two minutes ago. I can look it up on the iPad. I was key holder. I literally clocked in and went straight to solo flooring cause the mid shift was in the back finishing the pull, and the two other baristas left. Another customer was saying blanks name should be next. I said I have this name next. He then says that he should have a brewed coffee with this then precedes to tell me how to do my job. How ‚Äòbout you work on that right now instead? I was working on one DT and one mobile drink.

1l1elbu,https://i.redd.it/1jk96dyhrh4f1.png,Hired a coffee cart for our wedding and it was the best decision we made ‚òïüíç (√âclater Caf√©),"So my wife and I just got married last weekend, and while everything turned out amazing (thank God), there‚Äôs one vendor I feel like I *have* to shout out √âclater Caf√©. Bro. When I tell you their coffee is **lowkey buzzing**, I mean that in the most elegant, classy way possible.

We decided to add a coffee cart to the reception just to give our guests something different 350 cups ordered, and every single one *gone*. People kept going back for more like it was dessert. You know you nailed it when titas and titos are asking for the barista‚Äôs number like it‚Äôs some exclusive invite-only thing üòÇ

But seriously, it wasn‚Äôt just the coffee (which was 10/10). The whole setup was on point‚Äîsuper sleek, minimal, yet felt premium. Think: Parisian caf√© meets intimate wedding vibes. And the staff? So friendly, like they were part of the family. One of the baristas even helped calm my nephew down when he spilled juice on himself lol.

Anyway, if you‚Äôre planning a wedding, party, or literally any event where good coffee and great vibes matter √âclater Caf√© is the move. No regrets.

I've started carrying my aeropress with small baggies of pre-portioned coffee inside of the plunger so I have everything I need to make coffee except the water all right inside the mug.

For background, I'm in the military and go on exercises fairly regularly. The aeropress go plus is perfect for me because I can have everything I need to make a nice cup of coffee and it's all contained in the travel mug itself, which is an already insulated cup which is nice to have instead of drinking from a camp cup or something. Makes me feel a bit more civil which is always appreciated in a military field setting.

Hope this inspires some great ideas for you guys too! ",13,1748860208.0,AeroPress,0,0.94,False

It was a Saturday night, I was glued to my laptop screen, sipping from my coffee mug. The clock blinked
 12:49 am when I was almost convinced to leave for bed. 

All of a sudden, my almost so called ""dead phone"" lit up out of nowhere. 

‚ÄòOh, it's Rita! Why is she calling in this dead of the night‚Äô I felt. 
I picked the call in one ring but before I could ask anything she cut me off consequently. 

‚ÄúAshar, brother it's critically urgent, sorry for bothering you in such time‚Äù she spoke swiftly.
‚ÄúWhat happened, is everything okay?‚Äù I replied with a tight concern. 
‚ÄúNo, it's not. Someone's stalking me, my whole existence. Since you're in an investigative department, I considered it will be a cakewalk for you‚Äù she said, her voice carrying hope. 
‚ÄúAlright, how do you know that someone's stalking you?‚Äù I asked in an inquiring manner. ‚ÄúGive me all the details‚Äú I completed without wasting any further second.
‚ÄúHe sent me many menacing letters and texts. Wait, let me send you all the texts and letters‚Äù she said in one go. 
A moment later, screenshots and pictures filled my inbox. The situation is really terrible. Each text is more terrifying than the last.

‚ùùHey dear! Seems like you are ecstatic these days. How did you forget me that easily, hmm? For you my family lost me, how could I even let you breath? I will be the cause of your destruction. Be ready and till then, carpe diem!‚ùû

His messages are more like hiding something deep, untold. Feels like Rita really did something worse with him but what could that be? Who can this person be?
 I first asked her to ensure either she suspects anyone from her known or not. But in back, she completely denied which confirms it is someone out of her network but if so, why will anyone of her unknown try to harm her? 

A flood of memories overwhelmed my vision.

Who is that? I asked pointing my finger towards a boy in his 20's in their family picutre that was finely secured to the wall in a massive frame.
""Uhm, he is my step brother"" Rita answered who was packing her backpack for the way to collage.
I noded at her words.
""Let's go""  she completed.

""You never told me that you have a brother and that too a step one"" I taunt her when we both were walking on the empty road
""We don‚Äôt have any contact with each other neither do we have a good relation. So I think there's no need to talk nonsense about this""  by saying this she ended the conversation and I made an 'O'

The morrow, when I woke up, I discovered a text from an unknown number sent in the wee hours of the same day.

""Being friend is okay but don't create a fuss by trying to become a kin if not then I also have to think of you reluctantly""

Is he trying to threaten me? Well, I'm game, come what may but I am not going to step back. Only if he had any specific number it would be easy as ABC for me to trace him, every breath he is breathing. I didn't involve any of my associates regarding this matter since Rita pleaded me to handle the situation personally. Before I could think further, I discovered 4 missed calls from Rita. I called her back straight away and she picked up on the second ring. 

‚ÄúAshar how far have you gotten in the investigation?‚Äù she spoke right away.
‚ÄúI told one of my informers to trace his IP address. Soon, I intend to figure it out. Just give me two days‚Äù. I assured her. 

I checked his numbers and I perceived that he uses one of his telephone numbers frequently for sending texts and I optimistically think this can assist so I promptly started investigate through it. 

‚ÄúThat's good, please be early as possible, I feel insecure"" 
‚ÄúDon't sweat it, you have my back‚Äú I try to ensure her in a comforting tone and she hummed in exchange and ended the call.

Though I didn't mention it on the call, I actually suspected Rita too but since she's experiencing a mental health challenge, it‚Äôs better not to worry her in addition. I put police security around her homestead, they all are roaming like normal people so that no one doubts. I set out all these stealthily without her concern. I didn't want anyone to know about the protection not even her. I anticipate her to be fine or else would that be better if I informed her?

Two days passed normally with no further sign of the stalker, as if he faded with the setting sun.

On the following day, a notification caught my attention. One of my informers who was investigating about the IP address and also Rita's past, gave me all the troops regarding both the intruder and Rita. Earth from my feet completely slipped away.

So, I started building what I wished existed: a mobile web companion that truly¬†listens¬†to your body, using your daily feedback to adapt your personalized recovery exercises.

It‚Äôs about making self-management dynamic, because our bodies aren't static, especially when in pain.

We're at the¬†**MVP**¬†stage with version 2.0 of this project. My journey started with a simple online quiz about sciatica pain points, got 120+ responses from Reddit, which blew me away and showed there was a real need.

I then built a first version with a friend, got 10 people on it fast, but quickly learned a hard lesson: it was too much like a static info dump, and people didn't stick around.

That feedback was gold. We've since rebuilt it from the ground up with a core adaptive engine that learns from user input.

Me as founder, just working everyday as chief problem-solver, coffee-maker, and hopeful pain-reducer...hahaha

What I genuinely trying to do this month...

Get my first¬†20-30 early adopters¬†using this new, adaptive version.

Really understand if the personalized onboarding and the adaptive coaching (how the exercises change based on daily feedback) is hitting the mark and feels genuinely helpful.

See if this approach truly solves the ""static plan"" problem I experienced.

Gather all the honest, raw feedback I can to make it better, faster.

This community is amazing, and I'd be so grateful for how it helped me so far with others stories and experience.

Honestly, any insights or ""watch-outs"" from your own startup journeys!

Long story short ive been on ssri for 10+ years due to anxiety and depression. Been mostly on sertraline. Took a break 1 year ago. However last 6months ive been on 20mg prozac due to brain going bananas while trying to sleep. So i mostly take the med to calm the mind and help me sleep.
But the daytime energy is getting low in combination with my dry eye.
So my dopamine isnt really kicking and im trying to stay on the lower side with caffeine (only a cup in the morning) 

My question is if anyone have a decent combo to get that lill boost of energy during the day but still be able to sleep.

And also maybe deal with the nerv/muscle pain i have from years of stress/weightlifting and gaming.

I tried voxra combo a year ago with sertraline but it made me feel like i was on 10 cups of coffee. 

Or maybe i should just try those SNRIs instead. Been told to try them due to the pain but as always ive never heard a single good story about snri (but alot more with ssri)

Have a good day. Cheers from Sweden",1,1748859954.0,prozac,1,1.0,False
