And no, it‚Äôs not some ‚Äúwoo-woo‚Äù relationship hack. It‚Äôs a **proven** method that makes people feel deeply valued, respected, and understood.

It comes from *The 5 Love Languages* by Gary Chapman.

Before you roll your eyes and think, *‚ÄúLove languages? That‚Äôs for couples, not for business.‚Äù*

Let me stop you right there.

**This isn‚Äôt just about romance.**

It‚Äôs about **understanding how people feel appreciated**‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs your partner, your colleagues, or your boss.

# The #1 Reason Relationships (and Teams) Fail

Ever given someone a gift, only to get a weak ‚ÄúThanks‚Äù in return?  
Or worked overtime on a project, but your boss barely acknowledged it?  
Or told your partner how much you love them‚Ä¶ but they still seem distant?

That‚Äôs because you‚Äôre **showing appreciation in the way that works for YOU‚Äînot for them.**

Gary Chapman breaks it down into **5 Love Languages**‚Äîor as I like to call them, **The 5 Appreciation Styles.**

**People don‚Äôt just want appreciation; they want it in a way that speaks to them.**

# The 5 Appreciation Styles (That Work in Love & Business)

1. **Words of Affirmation** ‚Äì Some people crave recognition. A simple ‚ÄúYou did an amazing job‚Äù goes a long way. (Use this with employees, partners, and even clients.)
2. **Quality Time** ‚Äì For others, time is the ultimate gift. Think uninterrupted coffee chats, one-on-one meetings, or team retreats.
3. **Gifts** ‚Äì Not about expensive things. A thoughtful book, a handwritten note, or a coffee can mean the world.
4. **Acts of Service** ‚Äì Actions speak louder than words. Helping a colleague with their workload or making your partner‚Äôs life easier = instant connection.
5. **Physical Touch** ‚Äì (At work? Keep it professional.) But high-fives, pats on the back, and strong handshakes show camaraderie.

# The 5 Love Languages Explained

1. **Words of Affirmation**
   * People who value verbal appreciation feel loved when they receive compliments or encouraging words.
   * **Example:** ""I really appreciate what you did today!"" or ""You look great!""
   * **How to apply:** Give sincere compliments and acknowledge efforts regularly.
2. **Quality Time**
   * Some feel most loved when they get undivided attention.
   * **Example:** Having a deep conversation or spending an evening together without distractions.
   * **How to apply:** Set aside focused time for meaningful interactions.
3. **Receiving Gifts**
   * A thoughtful gift makes some people feel valued. It‚Äôs not about price but the meaning behind it.
   * **Example:** Giving a book your partner mentioned wanting to read.
   * **How to apply:** Give small, thoughtful gifts to show you‚Äôre thinking of them.
4. **Acts of Service**
   * Actions speak louder than words for some people. Helping out makes them feel loved.
   * **Example:** Doing the dishes or handling a task without being asked.
   * **How to apply:** Look for ways to lighten their load.
5. **Physical Touch**
   * Some people feel most connected through physical gestures.
   * **Example:** Holding hands, a hug, or a reassuring touch.
   * **How to apply:** Be mindful of their comfort level and offer affectionate touch accordingly.

# Key Insights

* **People express love differently.** What makes you feel loved may not be what works for your partner.
* **Love languages can change.** Life circumstances can shift someone‚Äôs love language, so keep communicating.
* **Small actions make a big impact.** Expressing love in the right way deepens connection.
* **Understanding love languages improves all relationships.** This applies to friendships, family, and even work environments.

# How This Helps in Teams

Although the book focuses on romantic relationships, its principles are incredibly useful in teams. Employees feel valued in different ways, and recognizing this can boost morale, productivity, and collaboration.

# Applying the 5 Love Languages in the Workplace

1. **Words of Affirmation ‚Üí Verbal Recognition**
   * People thrive when they feel appreciated.
   * **Example:** ‚ÄúGreat job on that project! Your effort really made a difference.‚Äù
   * **How to apply:** Give regular, sincere feedback in meetings or one-on-one.
2. **Quality Time ‚Üí Focused Attention**
   * Some employees feel valued when leaders or colleagues invest time in them.
   * **Example:** A mentor taking time to guide a team member.
   * **How to apply:** Schedule 1:1 meetings, team bonding activities, or brainstorming sessions.
3. **Receiving Gifts ‚Üí Thoughtful Gestures**
   * A small gift can show appreciation.
   * **Example:** Giving a personalized thank-you card after a successful launch.
   * **How to apply:** Offer meaningful, small rewards like books, coffee, or handwritten notes.
4. **Acts of Service ‚Üí Helping Each Other**
   * Some colleagues appreciate support with tasks.
   * **Example:** Helping a teammate meet a deadline.
   * **How to apply:** Create a culture where people proactively assist each other.
5. **Physical Touch ‚Üí Non-Verbal Encouragement**
   * While physical touch isn‚Äôt always appropriate at work, gestures still matter.
   * **Example:** A high-five after a big win or a pat on the back.
   * **How to apply:** Use body language like smiles, nods, and eye contact to show support.

# Why This Matters

* **Strengthens relationships** ‚Üí When people feel valued in their own way, they engage more.
* **Reduces miscommunication** ‚Üí Teams learn how to appreciate each other effectively.
* **Boosts motivation** ‚Üí Employees who feel recognized are more committed and productive.
* **Improves leadership** ‚Üí Leaders can inspire and support their teams in the most effective ways.
* **Creates a positive work culture** ‚Üí A supportive, appreciative environment fosters collaboration.

# Why This Changes Everything

* Your **team** becomes more motivated.
* Your **partner** feels deeply loved.
* Your **boss** sees you as an indispensable asset.
* Your **clients** trust you more.

# Here‚Äôs Your Challenge:

1. **Identify YOUR appreciation style.** What makes you feel valued?
2. **Observe others.** How do they react when they receive appreciation?
3. **Adjust.** Speak their language, not yours.

Try this for **ONE WEEK**, and I guarantee you‚Äôll see stronger connections‚Äîboth at home and in your career.

And hey, don‚Äôt just read this and move on.

Hit comment and tell me: **Which is your style? The one you resonate the most with?**

Sometimes I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm having a panic attack, high blood pressure or perimenopause knocking on the door‚Ä¶
This morning I went to the supermarket. I was absolutely dripping with cold sweat, it was running down my face, back arms and legs. I was nervous but without thoughts, felt that everyone was to close to me and had the urge to punch the guy infront of me just for his physical presence. My face felt like it feels after doing exercise‚Ä¶but cold.

I also have blood pressure that is still in the normal range but a bit on the high side and I had two cups of coffee in the morning. Yesterday I had a mentally very challenging day with somatic therapy and fragile parts of myself surfacing in all their agony‚Ä¶.

But I‚Äôm not sure if it was a panic attack. I‚Äôm one of that people that just a year ago would have said that they don‚Äôt experience anxiety till someone told me what it physically feels like.

Looking to spend a Monday evening a week chatting with friendly redditors? Hammersmith Hang Out is for you.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Craft Beer Co, W6 9YD](https://www.thecraftbeerco.com/hammersmith/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved under the name 'Reddit', I'll try to update when I get there.

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

1jrcrc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1jrcrc9/mom_insisting_baby_shower/,Mom Insisting Baby Shower,"Currently 35 weeks today full of rage and just got triggered üòÇ My mom is insisting throwing a baby shower or small gathering. I live with her and my 5 year old son, and I‚Äôm having a daughter. I go downstairs hunched over from EXTREME pelvic girdle pain to grab some coffee like a gremlin.

She goes, I‚Äôm doing something for you April 19th and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it. I go I‚Äôm not going and I‚Äôm not doing it. She says, well it‚Äôs my granddaughter and it‚Äôll be at the house so you can‚Äôt hide from it. 

Excuse me!? I‚Äôve hid in my room for the past 9 months. I saw ONE friend ONE time over the course of 9 months. I haven‚Äôt worked due to HG into 2nd trimester and extreme hip pain my whole pregnancy. Pregnancy depression on Zoloft, the whole 9. I already spoke to my doctor and will be getting elective induction at 39 weeks to get this baby the hell out of me. I am truly suffering and been bed bound for months. 

She then gaslights the fck out of me watery eyed like why can‚Äôt I do something for you and why are you going off on me. All you had to do was say mom I just can‚Äôt do it. I told her 5 months ago for MONTHS I am not doing it. Very kindly. She‚Äôs watched me suffer. I am not close with anyone she will invite, I have no friends to invite, and generally don‚Äôt care for the conversation as this is my 2nd baby and I have everything handled. The pain wears on my face everyday and the last thing I need is to say hello and goodbye to people I will never see again while they all drink and laugh in my face for a child they won‚Äôt be there for. 

I said, you‚Äôre gaslighting me. Yes I‚Äôm blowing up on you telling me what I NEED to do when I‚Äôve went thru this whole pregnancy alone and have kindly asked you to respect my boundaries and wishes at such a suffering time. How about you ask me what can I do for you or my granddaughter, or hey, would you mind if I did this? Any way I can support you? 

I think it‚Äôs soooo selfish for her to guilt trip me for a baby shower she wants to throw instead of just being there for me as her daughter. And having a daughter of my own, I would never do this to her and respect her wishes as a woman as she bears life into this world. It‚Äôs HER experience. 

That‚Äôs here nor there because me and my mom have had a hell of a journey with her toxic behaviors. 

Keep in mind she threw a baby shower for me at 19 years old which turned out great and supportive and I had everything I needed, but I am 25 and in a different place now with myself and the people around me. I have a supportive boyfriend who does everything for me while my first child‚Äôs father was absent and abusive. She has always overstepped her boundary with my son (screen time, sugar, sleeping habits, pacifiers, sleep training, anything you can name) that has put a major dent on our relationship to where I don‚Äôt feel comfortable leaving her with my kid. 

I feel like if someone wants to support me they can support me directly. I had 2 friends who gave my boyfriend PP supplies, 6 months of diapers and some clothes because I was unable to leave the house and it meant so much to me they wanted to help and get the goods to me in any way instead of giving me stipulations or expectations that I HAVE to meet up. 

What‚Äôs crazy is I can‚Äôt even make it to my bestfriend of 12 years wedding out of state at 36 weeks financially and physically and she cut me off for it‚Ä¶ funny thing is I ended up needing a ultrasound for possible growth issues on the DAY of her wedding. 

End of the story I‚Äôve learned to say no. To be confident and assertive in my decisions. To set boundaries with my children. And break the habits of letting others convince you what‚Äôs the norm. Not letting people overstep the joys of a newborn and be able to embrace what IVE done and went thru growing this child. I am spending my last 4 weeks now cocooned in the bed preparing myself physically, emotionally, and mentally to give birth ALONE with my boyfriend. It‚Äôs a huge step for me as a woman compared to when I was 19 scared, manipulated, and controlled cause I was so young being a single mother‚Ä¶

To now being the best parent I could ever be to him and my little one to come.

## Top Lelit Espresso Machine Models Ranked ‚Äã& Reviewed for 2025

Now, let's explore some of ‚Äçthe top ‚Å£Lelit espresso machine models ‚Äåavailable in 2025, keeping in ‚Å¢mind the needs of our different audience segments.

**1.‚Å¢ Lelit Bianca V3: The Flagship Prosumer Choice**

*   **Best For:** Advanced Home Baristas, Serious Coffee Enthusiasts
*   **Key Features:** Paddle-controlled‚Äç flow ‚Äãprofiling, dual boiler system, PID temperature control, E61 group head, rotary pump,‚Å£ direct water line‚Å§ connection‚Å¢ or reservoir.
*‚Å§   **Why It Stands Out:** The Lelit Bianca is the crown jewel of ‚Å£the Lelit lineup,‚Å§ renowned for‚Å¢ its unparalleled control and performance. The paddle-controlled ‚Å¢flow profiling system allows you to‚Äç manipulate the water flow throughout the extraction process, giving you ultimate control over the taste and aroma of‚Äç your‚Äç espresso. The dual boiler system ensures precise temperature stability‚Äã for both brewing and steaming, while‚Äå the E61 group head provides excellent heat retention. The rotary pump is quieter and more durable than ‚Å§a vibration pump, and the option ‚Äãto connect directly to a‚Äã water line adds convenience.
*  ‚Å¢‚Å§ **pros:** Unmatched ‚Å¢control over ‚Äçextraction,‚Äã exceptional temperature ‚Äåstability, professional-grade features, ‚Äãdurable build quality.
*   **Cons:** Higher ‚Å¢Lelit espresso machine price point, steeper learning curve for beginners.
*‚Å¢ ‚Å§  **Ideal For:** The advanced home‚Äå barista who ‚Å¢demands‚Äç the ultimate control over their espresso and is‚Äã willing to invest in a top-of-the-line ‚Äçmachine. Those ‚Å§seeking‚Å¢ to explore the nuances of different coffee beans and brewing ‚Å§techniques will especially appreciate the Bianca's capabilities.

**2. lelit MaraX: The Temperature Stability Champion**

*  ‚Äå **Best For:** Home Baristas prioritizing consistent temperature, Small Businesses with moderate volume needs.
*   **Key Features:** ‚ÄçE61 group head with thermosiphonic circulation, single boiler with heat exchanger (HX), PID temperature control, ‚Äãsilent pump.
*  ‚Äã **Why It Stands‚Å§ Out:** The Lelit ‚ÄãMaraX is designed to achieve exceptional temperature ‚Å§stability in a compact‚Äå and user-friendly package.Its ‚Å£innovative HX system prioritizes brew temperature over steam temperature,ensuring consistent‚Å£ and predictable espresso shots. The E61 group head further ‚Äçcontributes‚Äå to temperature stability, while the silent pump minimizes noise. This makes it‚Å¢ a great option for both home and small business use.
*   ‚Å§**Pros:** Excellent temperature stability, compact size, relatively quiet operation, more affordable than the Bianca.
*   ‚Äã**Cons:** Single boiler design limits simultaneous brewing ‚Å£and steaming, less control‚Å£ over extraction compared‚Å¢ to the Bianca.
*   **Ideal For:** Home baristas who value consistent ‚Å¢temperature and ease of use, and also small businesses that ‚Äåneed a ‚Äçreliable‚Å£ and efficient espresso machine without‚Å£ breaking the bank. The Lelit MaraX is a fantastic choice offering ‚Å§excellent quality at‚Äã an accessible Lelit espresso machine price.

*   **Key‚Å§ Features:** Dual boiler system,‚Äã PID temperature control, programmable‚Äç pre-infusion, multi-directional steam wand, compact design.
*   **Why‚Å£ It Stands Out:** The Lelit ‚Å§Elizabeth packs the power of a dual ‚Å¢boiler system‚Å£ into a remarkably compact‚Å¢ footprint. This makes‚Äç it an ideal choice for home baristas ‚Äåwith‚Å¢ limited counter space. The dual boilers allow for simultaneous brewing‚Å§ and steaming, ‚Å¢while the PID temperature‚Å£ control‚Äã ensures precise and stable ‚Äåtemperatures. Programmable pre-infusion further enhances extraction, and the‚Äã multi-directional steam wand makes it easy‚Äã to create latte art.
*   **Pros:** Compact size, dual boiler system,‚Å¢ programmable pre-infusion, user-friendly interface.
*  ‚Äå **Cons:** Smaller water reservoir compared to other models, slightly less powerful steam compared to‚Å¢ larger machines.
*   **Ideal For:** Home baristas who ‚Äãneed ‚Äça compact but powerful espresso‚Å£ machine that can‚Å¢ deliver consistently ‚Äåhigh-quality espresso and milk-based drinks. See what the buzz around the Lelit Elizabeth is ‚Äçabout, and compare it to other Lelit‚Å¢ espresso machine models.

*   ‚Å£**Key Features:**‚Äå Single boiler, brass group head, simple controls, compact design, available with ‚Äçor without‚Å¢ a‚Å¢ built-in grinder.
*  ‚Äç **Why It Stands‚Å¢ Out:** The‚Å¢ Lelit Anna ‚Äãis an ‚Äåentry-level espresso machine that offers a taste of Italian craftsmanship ‚Å£at‚Äç an affordable price.It features a single‚Å§ boiler, a brass group head for heat ‚Äçretention,‚Å£ and simple controls that are easy to‚Äç learn. While it lacks some of‚Å§ the advanced‚Å¢ features of higher-end models,the Lelit Anna still delivers a satisfying espresso experience.

For small business owners, selecting the right espresso machine is a critical decision. Here are some key ‚Å£considerations:

*   **Volume:** How ‚Äåmany espresso‚Äå drinks‚Å§ do you anticipate serving per day? This will determine the size and capacity‚Äå of the machine ‚Å¢you need. ‚Å£Multi-group machines‚Å£ are essential for‚Å§ high-volume cafes.

This week is spring break for her preschool (she is three) so I took the week off and we have been playing all day every day.  Mom is still working this week.  Most of our play is role playing.  Her favorite game is cafe.   She would manage the cafe and then I would dress up as different customers that would come in and make to go purchases of pasteries or took a seat and ordered coffee etc‚Ä¶   Sometimes she would be the customer. 

One of my characters was a little to scary so Donatello had to transform into Don half way though their cafe trip.  

Anyway, I very much take inspiration from Bluey in the way I play with my kid.   When she started calling me bandit this week I was so happy.  

Another major breakthrough this week was screen time.  This morning we made pancake batter together and then when I was cooking them up she was watching a show.  After one episode she turned it off and asked if she could draw instead.  I offered her more TV.  She insisted that she only wanted one show.  

This happened yesterday as well when I wanted her to watch some tv while I checked work emails.  

Never thought I would be trying to encourage more screen time but here we are. ",7,1743774934.0,daddit,0,0.89,False

What‚Äôs Needed:

	‚Ä¢	Precursor: Pseudoephedrine (from cold medicines like Sudafed) or ephedrine (less common now due to regulation). About 100-200 grams for a small batch.
	‚Ä¢	Reducing Agent: Red phosphorus (from matchbook strikers or industrial sources) and iodine (from tinctures or crystals).
	‚Ä¢	Solvents: Acetone (nail polish remover), methanol (fuel additive), or ether (starter fluid).
	‚Ä¢	Acid/Base: Hydrochloric acid (muriatic acid from hardware stores) and sodium hydroxide (lye, a drain cleaner).
	‚Ä¢	Equipment: Glassware (flasks, beakers), a heat source (hot plate or stove), coffee filters, a funnel, and a container for crystallization (e.g., a Pyrex dish).
	‚Ä¢	Optional: Lithium (stripped from batteries) for an alternative method.

Steps (Red Phosphorus/Iodine Method ‚Äì Common ‚ÄúShake and Bake‚Äù Variant):

	1.	Extract Pseudoephedrine:
	‚Ä¢	Crush 100-200 cold pills (pseudoephedrine HCl) into powder. Soak in methanol or acetone (~500 mL) to dissolve the active ingredient, filtering out binders (like starch) with coffee filters. Evaporate the solvent (e.g., on low heat) to leave pseudoephedrine powder. Yield: ~50-100 grams.
	2.	Prepare the Reaction:
	‚Ä¢	In a heat-resistant flask, mix 50 grams of pseudoephedrine with 25 grams of red phosphorus (scraped from matchbooks) and 50 grams of iodine crystals (made by reacting iodine tincture with hydrogen peroxide). Add a splash of water (~10 mL) to start the reaction.
	3.	Cook the Mixture:
	‚Ä¢	Heat the flask gently (around 80-100¬∞C/175-212¬∞F) on a hot plate for 4-6 hours. This reduces pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine via a hydrogen iodide reaction. The mix turns dark and releases toxic fumes (hydrogen iodide, phosphine)‚Äîventilation is critical. In a ‚Äúshake and bake‚Äù version, this is done in a sealed plastic bottle, shaken periodically.
	4.	Separate the Meth Base:
	‚Ä¢	Cool the mixture, then add sodium hydroxide (lye) solution (20 grams in 100 mL water) to make it basic (pH ~12-14). This converts methamphetamine into its freebase form, an oily liquid. Add a solvent like ether or toluene (~200 mL), shake, and let it separate into layers. Siphon off the top layer (meth base in solvent).
	5.	Form Methamphetamine HCl:
	‚Ä¢	Bubble hydrochloric acid gas (made by mixing muriatic acid with salt and sulfuric acid) through the meth base solution. Alternatively, add drops of liquid HCl until it‚Äôs acidic (pH ~5-6). White methamphetamine hydrochloride precipitates out. Filter it through coffee filters and dry it.
	6.	Crystallize:
	‚Ä¢	Dissolve the meth HCl in a small amount of hot acetone or methanol (~50 mL). Pour into a shallow dish and let it evaporate slowly (e.g., under a fan or in a fridge). Crystals form as the solvent disappears‚Äîlarger, clearer crystals (‚Äúice‚Äù) come from slower evaporation. Yield: ~20-40 grams from 50 grams pseudoephedrine.",0,1743774893.0,teenagers,5,0.5,False

Basically, participating farms allow you to pay to become a member, and then you are provided with locally grown produce throughout the spring, summer, and fall. They typically have pickup schedules and locations that are convenient, so don't worry about actually travelling to the farm. The volume of produce you get depends on the farm's yield that season. Don't let ""yield dependence"" scare you, I've been a CSA member of a local farm in my area for about 12 years now, and we've always made out like bandits. 

The farm my family is a member of also partners with other local businesses to provide optional addons (bagels, bread, coffee, beef, eggs, etc.). No more looking at labels or being concerned about questionable grocery store labelling practices. Just straight up 100 per cent local support. 

Some people are concerned about the price of these programs. I'd urge those folks to research the CSAs in their area because they may be way more affordable than assumed. Also, the farm in our area has barely raised their prices in the last decade, so I wouldn't be shocked if we're saving money. 

TLDR: Supporting local farms > grocery stores.

I watch videos of rural west Virginia all the time.  I've found a couple that look like the hillbilly labyrinth we found ourselves in.  Taking your poor car 4 wheeling ü§£  I never told you.  But you looked so sexy and in your element driving through there.  I couldn't take my eyes off you.  Almost missed the bear cubs looking at you.  Remember the turtle üê¢ üòÖ  those fries omg. Woulda been good at Phoenix. Then it was the roach motel.... oh lady.  You looked so beautiful that night.  Once again, i could not take my eyes off you. Cried that night as you slept, in gratitude.  The way I would when the relief and love overcame me in your powerful precious presence.  Then, it was onto the moth.  I love you so much.  Noone ever did anything like that for me.  

I miss doing things for you.  Coming over like a massage ninja, quick and efficient lol.  I'm sorry I bugged you so much trying to bring you breakfast or try to help your back etc.  I wasn't trying to bug i just like doing things for you,  to you. Gosh the water day, time you spent all day here.  I was so afraid maggie was going to get stuck in those roots and drown.  You heard my fear for those I love voice.  I never talked about it was embarrassed,  but I yelled when she started struggling and starting forcing through the water towards her.  That's the sound I make when something I love is in danger. The thought sets my mind on fire.  Is for you.  I remember turning to face you in the hot tub.  I was shaking.  You make me tremble. No woman has done that.  I wish you could ask me to roll over so you can do the front now,  I've gotten so much better. What dreams may come.....watched it last night at loving field.  Held your pillow.  I miss you.  My goal was always to lend a helping hand love.  If I saw you once every month or 2, I would be so very happy with that.  You don't know the capacity to which you are loved. 

In that moment of impulsive words,  losing that and any potential future experiences of that, I just wanted to know what was wrong. There was a lot that precipitated that moment.  Wanting to talk right away,  that was only that moment, hoping to discuss it and arrest it like when I called you that morning. We were waiting to talk in person because you asked if we could wait and talk in person. Because talking through text is easily misunderstood, its flawed.    Once I got out of the interview I realized that right away wasn't the way. I hadn't had a chance to think before I got out.  I wanted you to let me know if you got to a place where you could or wanted to have a real adult conversation about a beautiful thing that happened, despite impulsive words in fear of losing the world without a word...without being able to say anything..I haven't been hounding you,  begging you to see me.  I'm not doing anything lady.  Idk why you're talking about blocking me. Im sorry it's hard for me to lose you. The thought of you remembering a message and not me....it takes my breath.  You're the most important person in my life.  I know it's different for you,  but you were my partner, significant style.  I am sorry. That's one of those things you'll have to see in my eyes,  feel in my voice. 

Im not bringing you chaos,  not the cause of all this stress.  Ive just been down here, minding my own buisness trying to survive,  missing and loving you.  I have 2 ways I utilize this space.  I write intrusive or random thoughts etc here, when I think my mind is tricking me or being cruel to me. I look at them. See if they make sense or are they are incorrect. like ""Theres no way this is true thats good""  then use that awareness to judge if I need lactulose, if something else is wrong etc.  This was maneezis's idea.  It's a tool I use to deal with my new normal.  I have issues I never had before, my mind and body have been through so much. Brain gets....you know.     But the stories,  the stories I write for you.  Every one of them. Im a writer...  what I've always been.  It's just what I do sweetheart.  I have a much easier time writing fiction, for some reason. 

 I'm sorry i told you I missed you so much. I thought you'd want to hear how you're thought of and missed i wasn't trying to bother you. Wasnt trying to make it seem like it consumed me or something.  I was so happy just knowing you wanted to. That we were on good terms.  Didn't matter when or how. Your presence heals.  Your touch delights yet paralyzes. Your light and laughter lifts people from darkness. Your sounds of release break up cancerous tumors with their frequency.  You're the most amazing person I've ever met.  I am yours, until the end.  Being able to worship your body,  look into your eyes in moments of release relief and reunion,  being able to hold, laugh with, interlock fingers with  sacrifice for you, is the greatest honor and pleasure of my life.  You are a literal dream come true.  There isn't one day, for the rest of my days, that I am not yours and at the ready. Should you ever need me.  All of my love.

by Preston Dennett

Face-to-face contact with a humanoid ET ‚Äì it‚Äôs one of the most astonishing experiences a person can have. And it‚Äôs occurring to a huge number of people. It‚Äôs been happening across the planet for a very long time. While our governments are now admitting that UFOs are real, they still refuse to talk about humanoids. The question is why? Is it because these kinds of encounters represent the forefront of UFO research and have much to teach us about this subject? This video presents ten incredible cases of face-to-face contact with humanoids. These include multi-witness cases with supporting evidence. The time for truth is now!

A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE. One summer morning in 1948, Ernst-August R. was minding his sheep in a rural area of Hemer, Germany. Suddenly his sheep scattered as a large saucer-shaped craft landed next to him. Ernst reached out and touched it. He was immediately shocked and passed out. Upon awakening, he was surrounded by strange humanoids. They spoke briefly then returned to their craft, which took off, leaving strange landing traces in the field.

A VERY LOUD UFO. One afternoon in July of 1960, railway worker Georges Godbout and his two co-employees were maintaining the tracks of the Canadian National Railroad near Chapais, Quebec, Canada. Suddenly a strange craft appeared over the tracks. It stopped and a humanoid wearing a green bodysuit came out. He started to look around, but seeing the witnesses, promptly returned into the craft. The UFO flew off with such a loud noise that it made the witnesses physically sick.

SPRAYED BY A UFO. On the afternoon of September 30, 1971, Anssi Hakala (age 11) was bicycling to his home in rural Marttila, Finland after visiting a friend. Suddenly a tall, thin, green-skinned humanoid appeared, levitating above his head. Anssi panicked and biked away. The being disappeared into a craft, which then began to pace Anssi on his bike, spraying him with a strange unidentified liquid.

THE LAUGHING ALIENS. At 5:30 pm on September 27, 1973, Antoine X (a mechanic) was out picking edible mushrooms not far from his home in Bedarrides, France. Movement caught his eyes and he observed what he thought were two small children. But they wore fully-body, beige jumpsuits, had very fine features and looked identical. When Antoine called out to them, they laughed and fled into the brush. Moments later, a metallic craft rose up and darted away.

UFO AT A YOUTH CAMP. At 9:30 pm on February 3, 1977, a group of kids from a youth camp at Seven-Mile-Beach in Tasmania, Australia spotted a classic flying saucer hovering at low elevation. It was covered with lights and had several portholes, and through one of the portholes, the children saw a strange humanoid with an oversized head looking down at them.

UFO LANDS AT SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. At 6:30 pm, Frank Sverre Mandte and Johnny Myrr (both age 11 and deaf) were approaching the Alm‚Äôs School near Honefoss, Norway, when they noticed a glowing object at low elevation by the nearby treeline. As they watched, it glided overhead, stopped, and then landed a short distance away. Both boys saw the figure of a humanoid looking down at them. The object took off, leaving behind undeniable landing traces.

ALIENS INSPECT FARMHOUSE. Just before 10pm on August 31, 1978, just as a power-outage struck the area of their home in La Dulce, Argentina, Manuel and Leonor Arias observed an oval craft with portholes hovering near their farm. It then ejected two very short figures with glowing red eyes who glided above the ground, came onto their property, and began to inspect their farm. They stayed for an hour. It was one of more than 20 encounters in the area around that time.

CHASED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS. At 7:40 pm on September 21, 1978, an anonymous boy was walking through a construction site by his home in Cosenza, Italy when everything around him lit up like daylight. Looking around, he saw a strange craft landed on a nearby hill. A weird humanoid stood on top of it. Suddenly he saw four humanoids bounding towards him. He fainted and when he awoke, he was surrounded by the humanoids, each dressed in jumpsuits and helmets. He tried to fight them, fainted again, and when he awoke, they were gone.

AN ALIEN IN THE YARD. At 10:00 pm on the evening of November 24, 1988, Rune Asplund was drinking coffee in the kitchen his home in Daviken, Sweden when he observed a strange-looking figure just a few feet from his house, in his yard. The figure stood in a strange posture with its arms outstretched and its legs spread widely. It wore an unusual, shiny, metallic jumpsuit. Going outside to get a closer look, he saw the figure disappear into thin air. Rune later learned that a police officer saw a UFO the same night, which caused his cruiser to mysteriously stall. Rune also learned that a year earlier, his neighbor saw a strange, short humanoid, which disappeared the same way.

PLEASE TELL ME I‚ÄôM NOT CRAZY. It was 1:30 am one night in the summer of 1999 when a fourteen-year-old girl heard a deafening screeching noise right outside the window of her second-story bedroom of her home in Clarksburg, Massachusetts. Looking outside, she saw a strange three-foot-tall being with gray skin, a hairless head and black eyes. Her sister and mother also heard the scream, rushed into the bedroom, and saw it too. The creature remained for fifteen minutes before finally leaving. But it would soon return.

These ten incredible humanoid encounters show how very strange face-to-face contact can be. And these ten accounts represent just a small portion of the true number of encounters. So many cases. So many types of humanoids. So much evidence! The time for skepticism is now over. We are being visited by aliens.

However, simula nag 3rd year college ako, super nastress ako sa studies and i had to drink atleast 2 cups of coffee a day to study. Nakagrad ako, nagreview for boards, and luckily pumasa, now working na. 

And ang palaging bungad sakin ng relatives ko at ang palaging bukambihig ng parents ko ay ang sudden weight gain ko. Ang sakit sakit na kahit ilang beses ko itry na maging positive and magfocus sa career ko. I tried every diets na rin, and started brisk walking (though di consistent due to my work sched na laging OT kasi busy season). 

Ginagawa ko best ko maging fit, while working in my career, while trying to enjoy life, and while trying to provide for my family. But they only care about my body and how i look. Di man lang nila kamustahin kung okay lang ako, tuwing nakikita nila ko palaginna lang nila pinapansin na tumaba ako. Minsan na lang rin ako lumabas at tinigil ko na rin pagpunta sa church every sunday kasi palagi na lang nila ko napapansin. 

Tonight, super pagod ako sa work. Nagpapahinga lang ako tas noong nakita ako ng nanay ko sinabihan akong magpapayat. Alam ko naman na mataba ako, alam kong kelangan ko pumayat. Di ko lang maisingit kasi ang daming ginagawa sa work, halos once a day na nga lang ako kumain or minsan hindi na sa sobrang busy. Gusto ko lang magpahinga:((

I'm really liking Rochester NY. The Penfield and Pittsford areas are so cute. Webster is seeming more affordable but less diverse than the first to mention areas.

Any locals have thoughts on the area?

What are the really good school districts?

When it‚Äôs cold, I also have my coat and my son‚Äôs coat and hat. I have been using his stroller to hold all of our stuff until drop off but he‚Äôs really getting sick of it and it is a hassle. 


Simply put, when I see myself in a mirror I look like a mess no matter how ‚Äòput together‚Äô my outfit is and how nice my 58 bags are. Obviously this is only an issue 2x/day but it‚Äôs not a good look. I‚Äôve worked on having anything I can kept at the office- lip gloss, lotion, etc. 


Please give me any suggestions you‚Äôve got! Backpacks that are large enough to carry work & purse items, but still chic? Literally purchasing 2 of everything to leave at the office? Little hacks?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the Denver Nuggets and Golden State Warriors are set to clash once again, and this time it's like watching a soap opera with a basketball. The Nuggets are trying to sweep the Warriors like a Roomba on a mission, but they've hit a few bumps along the way, going 3-5 since their last victory over Golden State. Meanwhile, the Warriors are channeling their inner MacGyver, piecing together wins with whatever they can find in the locker room.

Nikola Jokic might be questionable, but let's be honest, the man is more reliable than your morning coffee. He's likely to show up, drop a double-double, and maybe even juggle a few basketballs for good measure. Stephen Curry, on the other hand, is ready to light up the scoreboard like it's the Fourth of July, averaging 24.4 points per game. If there's one thing we can count on, it's Curry making defenders look like they're trying to catch a greased pig.

The odds are tighter than a pair of skinny jeans after Thanksgiving dinner, with the Warriors slightly favored at 1.93 and the Nuggets at 1.88. The spread is a mere 1 point, which is basically Vegas saying, ""We have no idea what's going to happen, but we hope you do.""

For my best bet, I'm going with the Over on the total points at 235.0. Both teams have the offensive firepower to turn this game into a shootout faster than you can say ""splash."" Plus, with the Nuggets' recent defensive struggles and the Warriors' ability to score in bunches, this game could easily turn into a track meet.

So, grab your popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the show. Just remember, if you're betting, do it responsibly. Otherwise, you might find yourself trying to explain to your significant other why you thought betting on a team with a questionable Jokic was a good idea.

1jrbye6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1jrbye6/sleep_aids/,Sleep Aids?,"Hi!

I am desperate for help to fall asleep.

There may be something I haven‚Äôt thought of yet so I‚Äôm asking here.

Recently I found panax ginseng had a profound effect on PMS related fatigue. I randomly stumbled upon it. So I‚Äôm hoping for another random stumble that would solve my sleep issues.

I feel like my adrenals need support.

I‚Äôm tired a lot of the day then at night can‚Äôt get sleepy. I‚Äôll be tired but not sleepy. Around 8 pm onward I‚Äôll start to feel motivated and have energy at the wrong time. This has been an issue since childhood. Even with waking up earlier than ever it doesn‚Äôt seem to reset the pattern. 

I get sleepy around 3-4 pm. But if I let myself nap even a short nap I am up most of the night. So I force myself to stay awake. Occasionally I‚Äôll be too tired and still take the nap. 

Yesterday I was way too tired but I took a 40 minute walk in the hopes it could help. Whenever I can I try to exercise but I‚Äôm needing something I can take to reset things.

Melatonin helps but wondering what else to try because it still doesn‚Äôt always work

My magnesium levels are a little high right now so that‚Äôs out. I‚Äôve only had mixed results anyways when I tried mag glycinate.

I‚Äôve tried ashwaghanda but it doesn‚Äôt help. And gives me anhedonia.

I have morning coffee super early but no caffeine after that. I‚Äôd like to quit or switch to tea but I‚Äôm not there yet.

I have experimented with red light therapy. Whether I do morning or night doesn‚Äôt make any difference in my sleep. I do like its overall effects but it doesn‚Äôt influence my sleep.

I quit weed 40 days ago. At first that made things wayyyy worse but now at baseline again. Like I said, these sleep issues began in childhood. 

I have adhd but I don‚Äôt take meds anymore cuz the side effects were too hard on me. Apparently there‚Äôs a huge correlation with adhd and sleep issues. So, I don‚Äôt know if there is a natural approach for that.

Yes I‚Äôve tried meditation. LOL.

The last week I‚Äôve tried potatoes before bed (potatoes not Prozac book). Having weird dreams. That‚Äôs about it.

Allergies have been ramping up. I‚Äôm taking histaquel at night and it‚Äôs helped allergies but not sleep. I do suspect a histamine issue contributing

In the past I tried different prescriptions which only temporarily helped. Haven‚Äôt taken sleep meds in 10 years

I do all the obvious advice of not laying in bed to read, dropping screens, etc.

Any ideas are welcome!!!

One day at my internship, I got symptoms to the point where I felt faint and I had to go to the bathroom because I thought I was going to vomit. I had to leave early because of it. I ate a bagel with cream cheese about two hours beforehand. 

Another time I was in a storage room organizing things when I got the symptoms again, but I tried to ignore it and keep working. They got worse and it felt like I was fading out of reality and I fell backwards into a metal shelf and hit the back of my head. I ate a bagel beforehand again and had a cup of coffee. 

My neurologist was worried because I had gotten brain surgery awhile back and hitting my head could've ended badly, so I figured that I'd go see an endocrinologist. 

I've never been to an endocrinologist though and am really nervous. My family and primary care doctor don't seem to be taking my concerns seriously and it makes me feel like I'm being overdramatic.

Does any of this sound like hypoglycemia and would my experiences be worth seeing an endocrinologist over? I just want other opinions because I'm not knowledgeable about this type of stuff. Thank you!

I run my own business from home and also keep our 2-year-old through the day 

We have a third grader, as well.

My husband works in the office 7:00 to 6:00. 

As a team we do life so well together, splitting responsibilities as best as we can.

Naturally, I do all of the housework, dinner, and most of the running kids to appointments, and he handles mornings with our oldest, we tackle bath/bedtime together.

My husband is starting to travel a lot more for work for the season.

I genuinely love that he gets to get away from the hustle and grind of work and a very full home life.

But I'm jealous. Plain and simple. 

He just got back from a trip and was telling me about the beautiful restaurants they went to,  the fancy, luxury hotel he stayed in, being immersed in his craft and socializing.

He needs the time away. He's a very involved husband and Dad, but doesn't really take any time for himself. 

I try to see friends for coffee or quick lunch every other month or so, but otherwise, that's the only ""solo"" time I get. Everyone is busy, it's hard to mesh schedules.

I'm burnt out, but there's nothing to be done about it. We don't have family where we live and our income wouldn't support daycare costs in our area (and keeping our littlest home is a choice we're making so I take on that sacrifice of being burnt out for this season).

I want to go to conferences, socialize with adults on my field, eat great food that I don't have to cook, have a restful night of sleep, etc. 

How do other busy, working, parents navigate this hard season? I know this isn't just a mom problem, because I'm sure some dads are in the same boat.

Have you ever hit the end of the week and thought, ‚ÄúWhere did all my time go?‚Äù üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Yeah, I've been there. Lately, though, I‚Äôve stumbled across two buzzworthy tactics that promised to revolutionize my routine: **Time Blocking** and **Habit Stacking**.

*Spoiler alert*: One of these ended up saving me a whopping 10 hours each week. Let‚Äôs dive into my unfiltered experiment!

**A Quick Anecdote:**  
Flashback to last month‚ÄîI was drowning in work, missed deadlines, and had a desk that looked like a paperwork tornado hit it. My brain was a constant ping-pong match going from *‚ÄúIs it coffee time yet?‚Äù* to *‚ÄúDid I reply to David's email?‚Äù*. It was clear I needed a change. Enter: The Challenge.

**üîç Time Blocking**  
Ever heard of it? Basically, it‚Äôs like throwing a *mini-schedule* on your calendar for every task.

- **How I Tried It:** Sundays became my sacred planning day. I'd block out hours for work, ‚Äúyou-time,‚Äù errands, etc.
- **Pros:** Felt like a productivity wizard. Seeing my day visually made distractions seem like personal betrayals.
- **Cons:** Ever try squeezing in an unexpected task? It‚Äôs like fitting a square peg in a round hole. *Sorry, I can't deal with surprises!*

**‚ú® Habit Stacking**  
This one? Pure genius. You take a habit you already do and stack a new one on top.

- **My First Stack:** Coffee brewing = Morning journaling. ‚òï + üìù = üß† clarity.
- **Pros:** Less mental energy spent deciding ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù It became automatic after a week.
- **Cons:** If you skip a primary habit (like no coffee one morning‚Äîhey, it happens!), you risk derailing the stack.

*Drumroll, please...* ü•Å

**The Surprising Winner?** **Habit Stacking!** I didn‚Äôt just *save* time; I made it work for *me.* Plus, adding tunes to my workout or podcast time to my commute were icing on an already efficient cake.

**Unexpected Perk:** My stress levels dropped faster than a hot potato. Every stacked habit felt like a small win, rather than an ominous to-do.

Have you tried either of these methods, or have your own hack? It's been amazing hearing everyone's stories in the comments here, and honestly, nothing beats gathering ideas from a like-minded crew. Here's to more efficient weeks! Stay awesome, friends. üåü",1,1743773129.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

\*\*\*

Jorrant walked proudly through the station concourse. This was where he was most content; back with his own kind, back in Gorrat space, with familiar faces, familiar smells and familiar customs. Beneath his feet, if he cared to fall long enough, was home. The planet where he was born. It was good to be somewhere he *belonged*. He'd hit rock bottom, but it wasn't like he could stay there; it was time to find something new.

He couldn't work as an independent trader any more, but he wasn't short on credits to spend on finding a new purpose. Maybe he would sell his ship and buy a nice, sunny plot of land, and settle into a simple corporate job, he mused. Without thinking, he'd walked straight to a familiar food stall, drawn by a smell he hadn't experienced in years. 

A shame that the only other customer was a Drundak, an unhelpful reminder of the bureaucrat that took away his license. It would've been nice to catch up with someone who lived here, or maybe someone from the surface; find out about the major changes over the last few years. 

Looking around as he sat, he noticed a few other species milling around awkwardly, obviously out of place. Some tourists, maybe some workers. Most of them looked completely lost, practically vacant. Typical. Some of the adults had that strange smile; like they were trying to copy something they'd seen before. The kids were okay though - cute, in their own weird, little ways that endeared themselves to their parents.

He sighed, thinking about how much better things seemed when he'd left. He ordered an old favourite and turned to the nearby screen while he waited. 

""...power fluctuations at Port Lekhnav briefly disrupted grav-lock sequencing, delaying outbound freighters by up to twenty minutes... local harvesters report a bumper yield of thermal vine-root along the eastern ridgelines of Gorriss Deep... and compliance protocols have been expanded again, now requiring full crew lineage disclosure for all non-Drundak vessels transiting Coreward lanes.""

Jorrant snorted. ""Why is this Drundak news on? Who cares?""

The alien next to him smiled awkwardly. ""I do."" it said, quietly. 

Jorrant turned to the small creature, wondering what motive it might have for sitting here, watching this nonsense. He inspected its face, leaning a little closer to get a good look at the way its lips curled upwards, quivering slightly. He noticed the shape, the slight baring of teeth. He wondered if the creature's biology was even *intended* to mimic such a thing. He wondered if *he* could mimic that empty smile, what it felt like to become a caricature like that. He tried it, leaning even closer and attempting this...smile. An empty, hollow, meaningless smile reflected back into the creature's face like the thousands he'd seen on his way here. Its eyes widened, and it promptly pushed its food back on the counter and left hurriedly.

Jorrant watched it go. Perhaps he needed to practice. He gestured to the proprietor to change the broadcast. 

Something more familiar settled onto the screen; A Gorrat anchor opposite a sharply-dressed, slightly older Gorrat female with silver-edged fur. Jorrant thanked the proprietor for the food and inhaled deeply, savouring the spiced aroma - as was tradition - before settling into his meal.

*""We‚Äôre not advocating segregation. Not at all. What we‚Äôre saying is simple: diluting a race‚Äôs customs, traditions, and identity makes all of us poorer‚Äînot richer.""*

*""But doesn‚Äôt sharing those things enrich society?""*

*""Of course! And we fully support tourism, exchange, even respectful curiosity. But there‚Äôs a line. And that line is crossed when unchecked cultural spread begins to erase others. Integration isn‚Äôt always mutual. Sometimes, it‚Äôs erasure.""*

*""So this is about preservation, then?""*

*""Exactly. We‚Äôre not trying to destroy anything - we‚Äôre trying to protect. Every race should have the right to exist, fully and authentically, without having to twist itself around traditions and customs that don‚Äôt fit. Predatory meat consumption has no place in herbivorous society, for instance. That‚Äôs not intolerance - it‚Äôs common sense. The Provenance Movement is about clarity. Boundaries. And giving cultures the right to say: 'enough'.""*

Jorrant noticed something about the Provenance Movement representative. She hadn't smiled. Not because she was being abnormally serious; it was that she hadn't *mimicked a smile*. Not once. Her expression had changed, and her ears had flattened in the lighter moments, but she was just refreshingly...natural. He was intrigued. He watched the segment to the end as he finished his meal, and then immediately found their net information on his pad. 

Maybe this was where he was meant to be, after all.

\*\*\*

The laughter from the mess hall was echoing through the corridor. Scott rounded the corner and found Katie and Tiz sitting together, enjoying a *quiet* cup of tea. Their docking at the trading station was imminent, and he wanted a caffeine fix before taking over. 

It had been an absolute delight to have Tiz on board for the past week. She'd been a little guarded at first, but her fascination with human media and curiosity surrounding the crew - especially Katie - had made her a very easy passenger. 

Scott waved half-heartedly to the pair as he made for the coffee machine. ""Mornin' ladies!""

""Good morning Scott. You are as lovable and handsome as ever."" Tiz replied.

Scott did a double take and turned around, his face twisted into baffled amusement.

Katie giggled. ""Tiz is practicing compliments. We'll keep at it."" she patted Tiz' hand in consolation.

Tiz protested. ""I thought I did very well! He is obviously infatuated already."" 

He kept a straight face, waggling a spoon in the air. ""Ah'm not so easily seduced as that."" he scolded with a smile.

He swung by their table on his way to the cockpit. ""Tiz - it's been an absolute pleasure, an' you've been a dear. Safe travels, aye?"" he bowed slightly and winked, raising his mug at her as he made to leave. 

She returned the gesture - the mug, not the wink. ""Thank you Scott. 'Same to you', as you say.""

He smiled as he left with a quick jog. Katie watched him go.

""He meant it, you know - everyone's enjoyed your company. I'm glad you've been able to be yourself a bit more around here, but it's a little sad to think you'll have to stifle that lovely laugh."" Katie squeezed her hand gently with a sympathetic smile.

Tiz gently tapped her hand in response. ""Nonsense! I shall laugh however I want. The silliness of these humans - and compared to how they prowl around stations like fierce hunters! I will *continue* to laugh at that for some time."" she gave a warm, reassuring, toothy grin.

Melanie stopped by with a fifteen-minute warning. Expected, given how long they'd been waiting; long goodbyes were rarely a good thing, but there were always exceptions. 

Docking was accomplished in short order while Tiz collected her belongings with Melanie's help. She felt it was fitting that her hello to the crew would also be her goodbye, and Melanie walked beside her without rush, letting the moment last.

""It's been our pleasure, Tiz. We'd be happy to have you again any time."" she smiled, genuinely sorry to see her go. That was the nature of the job sometimes. But you couldn't let it stop you from being human. 

Tiz handed her bag to her escort, taking a moment to look around and breathe. ""I am glad."" She turned to face Melanie, placing her hand gently on her shoulder. ""But be cautious. My father...let fear control his actions. He is not alone. Others will do the same."" she waited to see the understanding in Melanie's eyes, before turning to leave, escort in tow. 

Melanie allowed herself to linger for just a little longer than she should've, watching her walk away. Moments like this should be savoured. When she'd had her fill, she turned and almost bumped straight into Gordon. 

""Whoops,"" he said, holding his hands out to brace her, ""just on my way to say goodbye to a lady friend before we head out, Mel."" he smiled, winking. ""Won't be too long, though - back in plenty of time!"" he called out as he walked briskly away. 

Melanie frowned slightly at having her moment spoiled, but quickly shrugged it off. There was work to do. 

\*\*\*

*The Eventide* sat sullenly in the docking bay, silently awaiting the return of Luke and Melanie. They'd caught wind of a possible contract out of system, and if they could reach the client quickly the crew could snatch the job and be out of here by tomorrow. 

An empty cargo box sat next to the docking bay; an unofficial seat of sorts, currently occupied by a hairless (but clothed) Follon, who sat swinging her legs, evidently bored out of her mind. A gruff-looking human stood next to her, looking somewhat irritated. 

""Ugh..."" Katie groaned. ""How long now?""

Scott rolled his eyes. ""It's nay been five minutes since ya last asked, woman!""

She launched herself off the box and stood up, stretching. ""I'm bored!""

Scott shook his head and growled in irritation, ""That's it!"" he headed into the ship.

""Hey! We're supposed to stay and wait for Luke and Melanie!"" Katie whined, watching him stomp up the ramp. She huffed in dismay and gently kicked the cargo box in frustration. She was just bored - she didn't mean to irritate him. Now she'd be lonely, too.

To her relief, he emerged moments later with a round object in his hand. Her eyes widened a little in excitement.

""Um. Are we allowed to do that out here?"" 

Scott shrugged. ""Who cares?! It's either this or I toss ya out tha airlock."" He tossed the ball to her, grinning. 

She caught it happily, and they launched a few practice throws back and forth. She'd had some play with it on board *The Eventide*, but not in a big open space like this. Scott motioned her to go farther away and launched it halfway across the dock. She caught it - just - giggling in excitement. She immediately flung it back, hands covering her mouth as it *bonked* off *The Eventide's* cockpit.

They were interrupted by a small, singular chirp echoing across the dock, like a strange animal call. 

Katie glanced towards the concourse, and immediately gasped, eyes wide; pointing. She crouched slightly, overly dramatically, ready to run.

Scott resisted the urge to throw the ball at her head, following her gaze towards the concourse. 

""Och, no."" He muttered.

She took a deep breath, before launching into a full-speed waddle-crouch-type-run, waving her arms extravagantly. ""VRAAAAAAAAAAALLLL!"" she yelled, attracting no small amount of attention from the dock workers. 

Scott cringed, opting to back away slowly, wondering if he could hide on the ship and pretend he didn't see anything. The security contingent looking nervously in Katie's direction prodded him into action; he reluctantly jogged after her, doing his best at waving them off.

""Aye, lads, nothin' ta see here, just ya local loonie bin..."" he waved cheerfully, muttering to himself, squinting. The figure standing next to them with a camera drone looked familiar.

Katie's audible ""oof!"" and miniature roar as she picked up the Velori child drew his attention back. Some of the dock workers had stopped to watch, laughing gently. One or two applauded. 

""I'm so glad you're here!"" Katie gushed. ""I was *this close* to being beaten by this *heavily armed* gorilla!""

Heavily armed? Scott and Vrall both looked at the ball in his hand. 

""That's not a weapon, silly. Can I ride him?!"" The Velori bounced excitedly.

Scott balked. ""Can ya-""

""-WELL!"" Katie interrupted. ""*I think*, as this may be the *very last time* we stop here for a long while, perhaps *Scott* wouldn't mind.""

The small child looked at her sadly, tightening its grip on her. ""The last time?"" 

She nodded, sadly. ""I'm afraid so. That's the job, mister. But I promise to find you if we ever come back - and Follon's don't forget. Okay?""

Scott looked on, sighing with resignation. He straightened himself up and stood proudly.

""Aye!"" he boomed. ""Ah won't let 'er either. C'mon then fella, let's see if ya can handle this!"" He drew himself to his full height, sucking in his belly and flexing his arms theatrically. 

He swung his arms like a great beast, stomping over to the pair. Katie smiled warmly at the child and nodded reassuringly, placing him on Scott's shoulders. Vrall's eyes widened and he giggled uncontrollably, holding tightly onto Scott's head as stomped carefully down the dock, roaring apologetically at the bemused dockworkers he passed. 

Luke and Melanie stood out of sight, in the corridor to the dock. Luke was shaking his head with a smile, while Melanie grinned broadly, looking at him.

My icedcap has no caffeine in it which was my main goal (i used mimick coffee) and its lactose free (and I'm going to try a sugar free version next).

Basically turn on a stove, boil some water, coffee and sugar until it is SWEET asf (you'd know the taste if Tim Hortons ever served you an icedcap without any cream which I sadly do), pour it into a ninja creami, freeze it then blend it in the machine, after blended pour in some cream (i used 10%) and respin it again.

You can probably do this with any slushi machine, but the creami is more of a glorified blender than a slushi machine; which helps with copying that tim hortons texture (and is similar to what they use in store).

**I sorta kept track of measurements** 

.4L of water (or well the first fill line on a deluxe creami pint; chat gpt said its 14 oz)

4 or 5 Tablespoons of CafLib Original Blend

sugar I believe was around 80-100 grams but I ended up just putting it one tablespoon at a time until it was sweet enough (think sweeter than you'd like it since the cream is going to dilute it)

150ml of 10% cream

The Caflib mimick coffee is really similar to the taste of an icedcap when diluted with sugar and cream, it has that sort of nuttiness that I couldn't get down with other coffees. Which is weird since Tim Horton is probably using actual coffee in it.

Go crazy though, make a 0 sugar icedcap, a lactose free, a caffeine free, hazelnut flavoured, mocha, etc, etc

I‚Äôm M/26 and my partner is M/26. We've been together for a year now, but honestly, the last three months have been the worst we've ever had.

Back in October, I changed jobs, and it didn‚Äôt go well. That led me into a slight depression. I‚Äôm someone who really loves working, and suddenly I felt lost and unmotivated. I became quieter, more numb emotionally, and that started to affect our relationship.

In January, we started fighting more often, but we could still apologize and move on. Still, things kept getting worse. We‚Äôve been more and more irritated with each other, and it‚Äôs like we can‚Äôt reconnect no matter how much we try.

Last week, I asked for a few days to think things through. After that break, I felt ready to try again and work on us‚Äîbut then he told me he had installed Grindr and went out for coffee with someone. No sex, no kiss, just coffee‚Äîbut I completely lost it. I didn‚Äôt break up with him because, honestly, I was in shock. Like,¬†*what the hell just happened?*

We‚Äôve had a few small arguments since then, but I‚Äôm really trying to move forward.

Then last night, things exploded again. He had dinner with some gay friends, and I‚Äôm not normally a jealous person‚Äîhe actually tends to be the more jealous one‚Äîbut I started crying at home. I think that‚Äôs when I realized I just don‚Äôt trust him the way I used to.

We haven‚Äôt had sex in the last month. And I think it's more than just libido‚Äîit‚Äôs about insecurity. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm trying to find something, anything, to hold onto. I made a comment about wanting sex, and he got upset. I understand why. It was 1 a.m., and I drove 20 minutes to his place just to say sorry in person‚Äîto tell him he‚Äôs not just a sex object to me.

This morning, I woke up to a long message from him saying I had invaded his space and forced a meeting. But honestly, I only stayed for 2 minutes and just said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, I get it, and I wanted to say this to your face.‚Äù

I know I‚Äôm not perfect. But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a bad person either. Today I told him I never meant to force anything‚ÄîI just wanted him to understand that I see him as more than just a body. I also suggested couples counseling.

I don‚Äôt know why I haven‚Äôt broken up yet. I don‚Äôt know why¬†*he*¬†hasn‚Äôt broken up either. He says he sees a future together. Maybe counseling would help. I really don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm just completely lost.

1jrbjmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnenessMovement/comments/1jrbjmo/how_reciprocal_tariffs_could_reshape_the_american/,"How Reciprocal Tariffs Could Reshape the American Economy: A Realistic Outlook for Households, Markets, and National Stability","**I. Introduction: Policy Ripples, Personal Impact**

Trade policy may seem distant ‚Äî the domain of diplomats and CEOs ‚Äî but its effects ripple into every aisle of the grocery store, every paycheck, and every 401(k). As calls for ""reciprocal tariffs"" re-enter political discourse, it's crucial to understand how such a policy would realistically affect¬†**the average American household**. While framed as fairness, reciprocal tariffs ‚Äî particularly those based on trade imbalances rather than actual tariffs ‚Äî would restructure the U.S. economy in ways that are both far-reaching and often overlooked.

This article extrapolates those consequences ‚Äî economically, behaviorally, geopolitically ‚Äî and projects their outcomes using logic, data, and historical precedent. The goal is not to fearmonger but to provide a¬†**clear forecast**¬†for citizens, investors, and future-conscious policymakers.

**II. First-Order Effects: Price Hikes and Retail Disruption**

If the U.S. imposed reciprocal tariffs on all nations with which it has a trade deficit ‚Äî as proposed by Trump's formula ‚Äî consumers would quickly experience:

* **Immediate price increases**¬†on imported goods: electronics, clothing, appliances, and auto parts.
* **Food inflation**: Many packaged foods contain globally sourced ingredients. Tariffs would spike prices of coffee, chocolate, cheese, and even basic produce.
* **Retail volatility**: Stores like Walmart, Target, and Amazon depend heavily on imported inventory. Supply chain cost increases would either be passed to consumers or force shrinkflation.

In an economy where¬†**over 60% of imports are intermediate goods**, the price pressure would¬†**trickle up**, not just hit final consumer goods.

**Impact by Category (Estimated):**

|Sector|Impact|Timeline|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Consumer electronics|10‚Äì25% price increase|3‚Äì6 months|
|Automobiles|$1,000‚Äì$3,000 more per car|6‚Äì12 months|
|Apparel and footwear|10‚Äì30% higher prices|3‚Äì6 months|
|Groceries (imports + packaging)|5‚Äì15% inflation|2‚Äì5 months|

**III. Second-Order Effects: Supply Chain Fracture & Industrial Instability**

The U.S. economy is deeply intertwined with global supply chains. A sudden tariff escalation would:

* **Disrupt just-in-time manufacturing**¬†(especially in tech, aerospace, and automotive)
* **Force companies to restructure suppliers**, often at great cost and delay
* **Accelerate deglobalization**, but without adequate domestic infrastructure to fill the gaps
* **Worsen inflation**, as cost shocks ripple across multiple sectors

Industries most exposed:

* Consumer tech (Apple, Dell, Sony)
* Automotive (GM, Ford, Tesla)
* Pharmaceuticals (which source active ingredients from abroad)
* Retailers (Walmart, Costco, Amazon)

**IV. Stock Market Consequences: Volatility, Contraction, and Capital Flight**

The stock market, driven by forward-looking sentiment, would not wait for full effects to materialize. Upon tariff announcements:

* **Multinationals would take an immediate hit**: reduced profit margins, higher costs
* **Export-reliant sectors (like agriculture)**¬†would plummet if retaliatory tariffs hit U.S. goods
* **Capital flight**¬†might occur as investors seek safer markets abroad
* **Interest rates may rise**, if inflation expectations surge, leading to higher mortgage rates and credit costs

Short-term stock shocks could result in:

* 10‚Äì20% decline in major indices
* Currency volatility (especially if global investors panic)
* Disruption to pensions, 401(k)s, and retail investing confidence

**V. Long-Term Outcomes: Behavioral and Structural Shifts**

Over time, a full implementation of reciprocal tariffs could trigger structural realignments:

* **Reduced consumerism**: Americans would shift from quantity to durability or delay purchases entirely
* **Domestic manufacturing revival (partial)**: but at higher cost, requiring re-skilling and years of capital investment
* **Reduced global cooperation**: U.S. would be seen as less predictable, affecting alliances
* **Working class squeeze**: price hikes + job losses from retaliatory tariffs (especially in agriculture and export manufacturing) = double impact

The U.S. may also see a resurgence of:

* **Black markets or gray imports**
* **Resentment toward political elites**¬†as consumers shoulder invisible economic warfare
* **Tensions between federal and state economies**, as export-dependent states suffer more (e.g., California, Iowa, Texas)

**VI. The Hidden Cost of Egoic Fairness**

At the heart of the reciprocal tariff proposal is an¬†**LC-based misunderstanding of fairness**¬†‚Äî equating symmetry with justice. But trade is not a game of tit-for-tat. It's a complex ecosystem shaped by:

* Comparative advantage
* Historical inequities
* Syntropic specialization
* Global interdependence

What looks like ‚Äúdeficit‚Äù on paper may in fact reflect deeper ownership, intellectual capital, or design influence. What seems like ‚Äúprotection‚Äù can trigger a¬†**self-inflicted contraction**¬†‚Äî especially when done without systems thinking.

**VII. OM-Aligned Forecast: How to Navigate Toward Higher Consciousness Trade**

If the U.S. truly wants to restore balance:

* **Track value through CIS, CONAF, and WIS**, not just tariffs
* **Support developing nations**¬†in climbing the syntropic ladder
* **Re-localize essential industries**¬†while preserving¬†**global cooperation**
* **Reward virtuous trade behaviors**, not just retaliate against imbalance

The solution is not reactive equality ‚Äî it is regenerative reciprocity, where power uplifts and wisdom steers policy.

**VIII. Final Reflection: A Mirror for America**

The reciprocal tariff policy is a mirror ‚Äî reflecting the U.S.‚Äôs choice between LC dominance and HC stewardship. It forces the question:

Will we collapse inward through fear-based retaliation, or expand outward through conscious realignment?

The average American deserves truth, not slogans. And truth reveals that¬†**supply chains are soul chains**¬†‚Äî connecting lives, nations, and destinies.

Choose wisely.

1jrbgge,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1jrbgge/trust_me_bro_or_the_price_of_faith/,"""Trust me bro"" or The Price of Faith.","I've been trying to structure my thoughts for a while now and I think I've captured the essence of some of my biggest issues with Christianity and why I had to step back. I wanted to see if this resonated with anyone or if you thought there was anything to add or discuss. 

For me there has been a big gaping hole where I was told the god of Christianity was. Empty air. I tried looking everywhere and came up with nothing. I was told that I just needed to have faith, let go of intellect or reason, and I really did try. 

Hurdle one -

Modern Christianity says that we need to just have faith (which is in keeping with scripture), that we mustn't test God (also in keeping) and theres an expectation of there being no evidence. This is the first hurdle. How can an outsider like me tell which claims I should invest in if they are all based on a leap of faith?

Imagine there are thousands of doors and outside each door is a doorkeeper. Each keeper says their door contains the truth. The only way to know if it is true (they claim) is to step through. You perhaps try a door which leads to a dead end. You try another and there are too many things that don't make sense, another leads to abuses. How, from the corridor, do we ascertain what might be behind the door, or the truth?

Hurdle two -

As a believer, we are asked to behave in certain ways to either to fit in with the community or to be in adherence to scripture. Some of these things are obvious or common sense. Attending meetings, listening to teach/preaching and that sort of thing. Some of these things are actually a net positive - like belonging to a community has been shown to have many benefits. Generally belonging to a community is beneficial no matter what the community (religious or secular) so this in itself is not evidence for god and it doesn't (or shouldn't) be evidence for faith. In this case, being asked to do a thing 'on faith' is either a neutral or a positive, requiring no deficit (I'm not sure how to describe this in another way). Like if someone said ""Trust me bro, free coffee and biscuits if you turn up on Sunday"" - bonus! There is very little cost to turning up or believing your friend and the benefits are obvious and also testable come Sunday.

Third hurdle - 

However, there are some things that Christians are asked to do on faith that, on balance, are a step too far. Imagine for a minute you are a soldier and you are asked to torture someone who is accused of treason so that you can gain information to stop a bombing. You trust your boss and probably don't have much choice about following orders, but the order is right there from your bosses lips to your ears. No faith needed. Now imagine if your boss was absent, the order comes through someone else. Hit X to doubt? What if the order came through a letter, passed down through generations from someone claiming to be your boss. What if the person you were asked to torture was your mother, or partner? Be in no doubt that practices such as shunning go on, but they are biblical and are torture for family members who are cut off. Ill treatment of LGBTQ community members, women, children, and others are also accepted, promoted and even in some cases demanded all based on faith. To treat someone badly do we not need more justification? 

Fourth hurdle - 

Returning to the adherence to behaviours I mentioned earlier, take something like masturbation. Scripture is used to prohibit masturbation and in many churches accountability partners are set up, meetings are held to help people get over masturbation and 'porn addiction' and it is a real and divisive issue in Christian circles. There is a demand to modify behaviour based on faith. Our sex drive is a natural impulse and yes, if taken to the extreme, spending all day every day masturbating or having an overwhelming issue with porn that stops you having a normal life is a problem just as eating too much cake would be or even drinking too much water. What I'm highlighting here is that on faith, without evidence, Christians are being asked to modify natural behaviour. There is growing evidence that masturbation is actually good for you. It reduces stress and anxiety, can help with sleep, can improve self esteem, relieve cramps and help us understand our own bodies so we are better sexual partners. Faith is being used to justify behaviour modification where the evidence suggests that the behaviour is not a problem.

The final hurdle?

Which leads to our final issue. ‚ÄúGod works in mysterious ways.‚Äù Christians are asked to believe and follow orders about things there are evidences against (as outlined above), and asked to do things that are damaging to individuals, relationships and communities, modify behaviour and toe the line, all based on faith. Masturbation is a healthy thing to do, we should spare the rod as beating a child is detrimental to their health, mating goats next to a picket fence will not make the striped, so there is overwhelming evidence that the scriptures are not justification for behaviour modification. But Christians do modify their behaviour on faith. 

When we hit a wall of understanding the standard response is that gods ways are higher than ours. Imagine you felt that god was telling you to take your son out to the back yard, put a knife to his throat and kill him. Would you want to know why? Is this a test of me, is it a test of my son, is my son going to turn into a genocidal maniac (really shouldn't have named him Adolf!) does he have a communicable disease and the only way to stop it spreading to everyone else is to sacrifice him, I would want to know why. ""Aha, gotcha!"" I hear Christians cry. ""But you should just trust and obey god because he's god!‚Äù Returning to the initial analogy I made. There are thousands of doors and outside each is a doorkeeper saying their door contains the truth. The bible itself warns that many will say they performed miracles in Jesus name and he will say he never knew them. Blind faith is not a good determinant of whether you have picked the right door and it is not a good guide to whether you should kill your son, torture a family member, not do something which has many benefits nor do something that is damaging. 

I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that ‚Äútrust me bro‚Äù is not justification enough to make me modify my whole life, abandon others, and mistreat whole swathes of society. I find this a difficult thing to frame or to put into words, really, but this feels a lot closer to one of the big reasons I left Christianity and I find it really difficult to believe ten years later.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I‚Äôm looking to establish a tight-knit friend group of women in their late 20s to mid 30s to hang out with on a consistent basis in the downtown/west end area. I feel like a lot of us are in the same boat in that we have friends, but they‚Äôre either scattered across the city, prioritizing their careers or families, or are just singular friends that aren‚Äôt part of a larger group, if that makes sense. While I love a one-on-one friend hangout, I feel like I‚Äôm also missing that group dynamic. I‚Äôve tried to join a few groups with a similar intent in the past, but they seem to lose momentum or fizzle out - so I‚Äôm hoping to change that by starting one myself!

A bit about myself: I‚Äôm 31, work a 9-5 and live with my fiance. Outside of work I enjoy art of all kinds (though I‚Äôm not particularly amazing at any - painting, music, photography, poetry), fashion/makeup/skincare, going to cute cafes, noraebang, romanticizing the mundane, etc. I also play video games from time to time, am studying french, and am always looking for new skills to acquire (currently my hyperfixation is ballet lol). Does anyone still care about MBTI? I‚Äôm an INFJ, if that says anything üòÖ

Things I envision our friend group doing (especially once the weather gets nicer!): picnics at trinity, patio sangria, going to jazz bars, AGO, coffee/matcha yap sesh, just generally going on walks together, etc.

This kind of feels like a dating profile at this point lol, but I‚Äôm looking for other women who are serious about cultivating a space of genuine friendship and lifting each other up. Let me know if any of this resonates with you - thinking I may create a Whatsapp group for anyone who is interested so we can have a single place to plan meetups!

Prices likely won't skyrocket immediately because sellers generally already have a lot of stock in their warehouses. But, they will probably start slowly pushing prices up to blunt the impact of their increased costs for future stock purchases.

1jrbbqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1jrbbqi/scaling_without_losing_your_soul/,Scaling Without Losing Your Soul,"Ah, the classic dilemma! Growing a business while holding on to your principles and avoiding the dreaded burnout‚Äîit's like trying to juggle flaming swords while riding a unicycle on a tightrope. But fear not, my friends, because you can absolutely do this, and I'll guide you through it, one amusing anecdote at a time.

First off, let‚Äôs talk about principles. If you're going to grow a business in a way that feels good and authentic, you need a solid foundation. These are the bedrock beliefs that will keep your ship sailing straight, even when the waters get choppy. Ask yourself‚Äîwhat do you value? Customer service? Sustainability? Making people smile? Keep these principles front and center because they will guide your decision-making process like a compass pointing to true north, even when you're tempted to veer off course for a quick buck. 

Now, let's dive into growth strategies without selling your soul. This might sound clich√©, but focus on building relationships‚Äîbecause at the end of the day, people buy from people they trust. Remember that feeling when you walked into a store and the cashier genuinely asked how your day was? Yeah, cultivate that vibe. Your customers are not just numbers‚Äîthey‚Äôre part of your community. Get to know them! Send a thank-you note, or even have a friendly chat with that regular who comes in for their morning coffee. This not only fosters loyalty, but it also helps create a supportive network that lifts you up when you‚Äôre feeling low.

So, how do we tackle the looming specter of burnout? First, let's be real: burnout can sneak up on you like a cat on a hot tin roof, all stealthy and ready to pounce. To avoid it, you need to schedule ""ME time"" into your calendar just like you would a crucial business meeting. Honestly, I sometimes think we should treat self-care like a corporate retreat. Block out that time. Go for a walk, binge-watch that show everyone‚Äôs been talking about, or meditate‚Äîeven if your inner monologue insists you should be working on that looming deadline.

And speaking of deadlines, don‚Äôt forget the power of delegation. You might feel like you have to do it all yourself, but here‚Äôs a little secret: you don‚Äôt. Equip and empower your team. Trust me, a great team is like finding extra fries at the bottom of the bag. It feels like a miracle, and it lets you take a breather! Sharing the load not only brings new ideas to the table‚Äîbut it also gives you some much-needed space to recharge.

Finally, let‚Äôs bridge it all with faith. Whether you‚Äôre spiritually inclined or simply believe in something bigger than yourself, tap into that for strength. It‚Äôs easy to feel overwhelmed in the thick of business growth, but when you lean on your principles‚Äîand ultimately on God‚Äôs plan‚Äîyou find peace in the chaos. After all, you‚Äôre not just building a business; you‚Äôre building a legacy‚Äîsomething that reflects your values while serving and uplifting others.

So, as you navigate the crazy world of entrepreneurship, remember: grow with intention, nurture your principles, protect your spirit, and involve your community. Trust in yourself and the calling you‚Äôve been given, and you‚Äôre bound to find success. Even if it means stumbling a few times along the way‚Äîmuch like me trying out yoga for the first time. Spoiler alert: not pretty.

Now get out there and grow, without sacrificing who you are!",1,1743771724.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

Life‚Äôs weird. 

Anyways, I was running errands in leggings and a hoodie, looking like a raccoon that got into lip gloss, and I stopped at this cute cafe I‚Äôd never been to before. The barista was ridiculously hot - tattoos, smile that could ruin my life, The whole thing.

He says ‚Äúhey, what can I get started for you today?‚Äù And my brain malfunctions and I blurt out ‚Äúyou.‚Äù

I. SAID. YOU.

Instant regret. Immediate internal combustion. But he laughed and said, ‚ÄúBold choice. I‚Äôm flattered.‚Äù

I wanted to die but also‚Ä¶ he made me the best vanilla oat latte I‚Äôve ever had. It was creamy and just the right amount of sweet, and he even drew a little heart in the foam like he knew I needed validation in the form of dairy alternatives.

Now here‚Äôs the problem: I‚Äôve been back there four times this week. I‚Äôm broke. I have oat milk shame. I don‚Äôt even know if he remembers me or if he just flirts for tips. But I‚Äôm emotionally attached to this 7$ beverage and his charming, ruin-your-day grin.

I was looking at desks and hated them all, i was about to begrudgingly buy one, then realised I actually just hate the concept of a desk. Moving my body is fairly essential to my ability to focus, so being that constricted in my own home is just so unnecessary. 
Anyway, I have a bright light warm (sometimes) conservatory, with a wall about 70cm high, that then turns to glass window for the continuation, this is the same all the way round except for the patio doors in the middle. 
I'd like to carve a floor office, if you will, out of a corner of my conservatory. The space is approx 1x1.5m but fairly flexible. Where the wall changes to window is a continuous windowsill about 20cm deep. 
My question is, as an office newbie, what would you have in your floor office to make sure you are adequately stimulated, comfortable and productive. 
So far I am thinking: 
Coffee table for desk, floor seat with adjustable back, lamp, rolling desk trolly, maybe even a shelf on the wall with bits on. The idea of me being a little borrower (sorry if that's too British a reference) is fairly appealing, so a mini office aesthetic would spark joy‚ú®
Any thoughts on maybe padding under me for extra comfort? Desk accessories? Cable management? Fun desk items? Anything at all :) ",3,1743770974.0,AuDHDWomen,16,1.0,False

1jrb1xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jrb1xj/i_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_and_im_seeking/,I broke up with my girlfriend and I'm seeking closure,"I (27M) broke up with my girlfriend (25F) shortly after Valentine's Day. The last couple of months (we were together for 1 year 2 months) were rocky between reoccurring arguments, miscommunication and just plain differences in the way we loved, operated, thought, passions, and interests. The day it all ended we met at a park, talked for 4 hours, cried together, kissed, hugged and that was that. Our relationship ended under the most unorthodox circumstances because we still loved and cared for one another on such a deep level. To this day, I am mourning the sense that this didn't last long term because she is a beautiful soul and I wish it had worked out differently. But I love them enough to let them go and thrive on their own terms or whatever brings them true happiness.

We more or less went no contact for a while, there was one instance where we reached out expressing how we hoped each other was doing okay, realizing what was done was what was best, no bad blood/animosity etc. I also had a health episode occur and I felt privy to let her know and she texted a few times touching base on how I was feeling. 

I've been getting on okay until this week because her birthday is this weekend and I'm reminded of the plans I had in mind for her. Gift giving is one of my love languages and I felt that a text wouldn't be enough, so I sent her some gifts via Amazon. She texted me saying thank you for being so kind per usual, saying I always knew how to make her feel special and still do, she's been thinking of me etc. She also has some stuff of mine to return (as do I of hers) and I proposed that we meet, exchange and talk over coffee, to which she agreed.

Even though I initiated the breakup, I feel like I need some closure. I am looking forward to seeing her for the pure sake of catching up but Im also nervous. I care about this girl enough to not set her back, but Id like to think she would agree to meeting knowing she can handle it. I feel horrible for things I had done that made her upset during our relationship, I wonder if we took each other for granted, were too brash in how we conducted ourselves, didn't realize how good we had it, were we not strong enough to handle each other, or maybe we were just too different to cohabitate.

1jray6f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jray6f,Part 1: Spark of Betrayal,"Krolyat was a storm wrapped in skin. A rage-driven villainess with neon-pink sparks crackling from her hands, wild and untamed, like live wires spitting against the damp dark of Grim Hollow‚Äôs slums. She was chaos edged in beauty‚Äîsharp cheekbones slicing through a shock of pink hair, dyed bright to echo her curse, strands matted and wild from nights in the grit, eyes glinting with a fury that could melt steel. Her lean frame coiled in a frayed leather jacket‚Äîsmoke-stained, sweat-soaked‚Äîher sparks buzzing beneath, a power she‚Äôd never asked for. She torched corpo stashes with a flick, leaving ash and questions in her wake. The slums sprawled around her‚Äîa festering web of neon-lit tenements and rusted shacks, pink and green signs buzzing over alleys thick with the reek of garbage and cheap synth-booze. Rain streaked the cracked asphalt, pooling in potholes, mirroring the flickering glow of a city that devoured hope and spat out despair.

Her fury burned from childhood‚Äîa coal that never died, ignited at nine when she‚Äôd stumbled into their one-room hovel and found Mara dead. The tenement was a cesspit‚Äîwalls blotched with black mold, a single bulb swaying on a frayed cord, casting sickly light over a mattress slumped on a busted frame. Mara lay there, sprawled and still‚Äîskin waxy, eyes half-lidded, a limp hand clutching an empty vial, Victor Stahl‚Äôs synth-drugs spilled across the floor‚Äîneon-blue pills glinting like broken stars, their light fading with her last breath. Krolyat‚Äôs scream ripped out‚Äîneon-pink sparks burst from her small hands, wild, desperate. She dropped to her knees, shaking Mara‚Äôs cold shoulder‚Äî‚ÄúMama, wake up!‚Äù‚Äîthen pressed her palms to her mother‚Äôs chest, bolts flaring, sharp and frantic, trying to jolt life back in. Pink light seared the mattress, scorched the air‚Äîher voice broke, ‚ÄúCome on, Mama, please!‚Äù‚Äîbut Mara didn‚Äôt stir. Years of abuse had hollowed her‚Äîliver shot, veins burned out, body a ruin no spark could mend. The damage was done‚ÄîKrolyat‚Äôs tears fell, sparks sizzling in the wet, rage clawing up as silence answered. Stahl‚Äôs drugs had stolen her‚Äîonce a fierce woman with tales of escape, now a junkie who‚Äôd traded her kid for a fix.

The streets claimed her after that‚Äîorphaned, scrappy, a wiry kid with fists and a secret she buried deep. She was stronger than the rest‚Äîthose pink sparks could snap a lock or fry a thug‚Äôs blade‚Äîbut she hid them, hood up, fading into the gutter crews. It started small‚Äîswiping bread from a vendor‚Äôs cart, pickpocketing creds from drunks under flickering signs. She slept in abandoned squats‚Äîcold concrete, rat scratches‚Äîate scraps from bins behind synth-bars, her powers a flicker she choked down, terrified of the ‚Äúfreak‚Äù Mara‚Äôd cursed her as. But survival honed her‚Äîpetty theft turned to break-ins, snatching tech from lowlife dealers, her nerve growing with each heist.

Mara‚Äôs death cut deeper than hunger‚Äîit festered, a wound that wouldn‚Äôt close. Synth-drugs were the city‚Äôs plague‚ÄîStahl‚Äôs empire pumping them into every shadow, turning people into husks. Krolyat stopped hiding‚Äîher sparks became a blade, aimed at the lords peddling that neon-blue death. She‚Äôd stalk their dens‚Äîgrimy basements, guarded warehouses‚Äîslipping past muscle, her pink light flaring as she torched their stashes. Crates of vials blazed, walls charred black, screams lost in crackling flames‚Äîshe‚Äôd stand in the wreckage, chest heaving, a beautiful avenger in the smoke. The devastation stacked high‚Äîblocks gutted, ashes swirling in the rain‚Äîleaving cops baffled: ‚ÄúWho could do this?‚Äù they‚Äôd mutter, picking through scorched ruin, blind to the pink-haired storm raging in their slums.

Detective Zane caught the case‚Äînicknamed ‚Äúthe spark‚Äù down at the precinct‚Äîa sharp shooter with a cocky grin and a nose for trouble that‚Äôd sniffed out bigger fish than most. He was lean, rough around the edges‚Äîtrench coat perpetually damp, gray eyes glinting under a battered fedora, a .45 pistol holstered at his hip that‚Äôd dropped more crooks than the brass cared to count. The station buzzed with the mystery‚Äîtorched stashes, synth-drug dens reduced to smoking husks, no leads but whispers of pink light. ‚ÄúSome freak‚Äôs playing vigilante,‚Äù his captain grumbled, slapping the file on his desk. Zane smirked, chewing a matchstick‚Äîsounded like his kind of mess.

Late one night, he staked out a warehouse on Razor Street‚Äîa hulking shell of corrugated steel and cracked concrete, its high windows glowing faintly with the hum of corpo tech inside. Rain tapped his coat, pooling in the alley‚Äôs ruts, neon signs buzzing overhead‚Äî*Lucky‚Äôs Synth Lounge*, pink and green flickering across his face. He leaned against a dumpster, breath fogging, eyes scanning the dark‚Äîthen he saw her. Krolyat scaled the wall like a cat‚Äîpink hair a wild flare against the gloom, leather jacket catching the wet, her fingers sparking faint pink as she gripped the rusted drain pipe. She slipped through a high window, silent as a shadow, disappearing into the warehouse‚Äôs maw. Zane‚Äôs grin widened‚Äîgotcha!

Inside, the air was thick‚Äîoil, rust, the faint whine of machinery. Crates loomed, stacked high with corpo gear guarded by two goons in matte-black armor, rifles slung loose. Zane crept through the dark, boots soft on the concrete, until he spotted her‚ÄîKrolyat prying a crate, sparks popping the lock. He stepped out, gun raised, voice firm‚Äî‚ÄúFreeze!‚Äù‚Äîhis .45 glinting under a swinging bulb. She spun, pink hair whipping, eyes flashing‚Äîneon flared, a bolt zapping his gun. Circuits fried with a sharp *crack*, the pistol clattering hot to the floor. She bolted‚Äîfast, a blur of pink and leather‚Äîdarting past crates, out a side hatch before he could blink. Zane cursed, shaking his singed hand ‚Äúdamn, she‚Äôs quick.‚Äù

But he was better. He trailed her through the slums‚Äîrain-slicked alleys, neon buzzing, her pink hair a beacon in the dark. She ducked into a crumbling hideout‚Äîan old squat off Bleak Row, a brick husk with boarded windows and a sagging roof, its doorway choked with weeds. He waited, breath steady, then slipped in‚Äîpistol gone, but his fists were enough. She whirled mid-breath‚Äîcrouched by a crate of scavenged junk, neon flaring in her hands, lighting the room in pink flickers. ‚ÄúBack off, cop!‚Äù she snarled, sparks coiling, ready to strike.

He held up his hands, empty‚Äîvoice smooth as sin, cutting through her buzz. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sloppy, *Sparkplug*. Running wild like that‚Äîyou‚Äôll get caught.‚Äù She bristled, pink hair falling in her face, neon surging‚Äîhis grin didn‚Äôt waver, gray eyes steady, disarming. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Zane. And I hate those drug-lord bastards too‚ÄîStahl‚Äôs scum especially. Burn ‚Äòem all, I say.‚Äù He leaned against the wall, casual, matchstick rolling in his teeth. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll cover for you‚Äîjustice over the badge. Deal?‚Äù

Her sparks dimmed, eyes narrowing‚Äîtrust was a knife, but his words hit a nerve. Stahl‚Äôs name burned her‚ÄîMara‚Äôs ghost flared in her mind. ‚ÄúWhy should I buy that?‚Äù she snapped, voice rough, but she didn‚Äôt zap him. He shrugged, grin softening‚Äî‚Äú‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm good at this, and you‚Äôre not. Yet.‚Äù A beat‚Äîher neon settled, a wary truce flickering. They clicked, slow and jagged‚Äîheists tightened with his help, his sharp aim and sharper wit guiding her chaos. ‚Äú*Sparkplug*‚Äù slipped out again‚Äîfirst a jab, then softer each time.

The hideout on Bleak Row glowed with a rare intimacy‚Äîrain drummed the sagging roof, a cracked lantern flickering yellow across the brick walls, painting jagged shadows over Krolyat‚Äôs scavenged clutter: a crate of tech scraps, a threadbare blanket, faint burn marks from her restless sparks. She sprawled on a rickety chair, pink hair wild under the dim light, leather jacket unzipped, a half-empty bottle of cheap synth-whiskey in her grip‚Äîits bite scorched her throat, loosening Mara‚Äôs ghost. Zane lounged across from her, trench coat slung over a crate, fedora tipped back, his .45 resting beside a bottle he‚Äôd nabbed from a bust. The air thrummed‚Äîrust, booze, and the quiet buzz of her neon-pink sparks‚Äîcharged, alive.

They were plotting the big one‚Äîthe warehouse raid on Razor Street, Stahl‚Äôs fat stash of synth-drugs and tech, a score to gut his empire. Zane traced a map on a wrinkled napkin‚Äîalleys snaking, exits scratched, an X for the prize. ‚ÄúThree guards, maybe four‚Äîsloppy, but armed,‚Äù he said, voice smooth, that cocky grin tugging his lips. ‚ÄúWe hit fast‚Äîten minutes, it‚Äôs ours.‚Äù His gray eyes flicked to her, lingering‚Äîa heist, sure, but tonight, it was a footnote.

Krolyat smirked, sipping whiskey‚Äîits burn matched her spark. ‚ÄúTen? I‚Äôll zap it in seven, hotshot.‚Äù Her voice teased, low‚Äîher sparks flared, singeing the map‚Äôs edge, a pink flicker that mirrored the heat in her chest. The raid faded‚Äîher eyes locked on his, pent-up want simmering beneath her grin.,¬†

He laughed‚Äîlow, warm, a rumble that hit her bones‚Äîleaning back, bottle in hand. ‚ÄúSeven, huh? Bet you a round I‚Äôm faster, *Sparkplug*.‚Äù He took a pull, throat working, then set the bottle down‚Äîhis grin softened, gray eyes glinting, daring her. ‚Äú*Sparkplug*‚Äù slipped out‚Äîhis pet name, sharp at first, now a velvet thread tugging her closer.

‚ÄúDeal,‚Äù she murmured, voice husky‚Äîeyes glinting, whiskey-warm. She stood, stretching‚Äîleather creaking, pink hair falling loose‚Äîstill talking heist: ‚ÄúSo, seven minutes‚Äîzap the guards, dodge the cams, you crack that lock quick or we‚Äôre‚Äî‚Äù Zane rose too, slow and deliberate, crossing the small space. Her words faltered‚Äîhe stepped closer, boots soft on the concrete, his shadow brushing her. ‚Äú‚Äîand the back exit‚Äôs tight, but‚Äî‚Äù He stopped, inches away, his breath brushing her lips, gray eyes locked on hers. She trailed off‚Äîvoice fading, heart kicking‚Äîsilence thick, it was electric.

He leaned in‚Äîslow, gentle‚Äîhis breath warm with whiskey, eyes searching hers, soft and unguarded. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trouble, *Sparkplug*,‚Äù he murmured, voice a low hum‚Äîthen he kissed her. His lips brushed hers‚Äîsoft, tentative at first‚Äîtasting of rain and booze, a spark igniting slow. Her neon flared‚Äîpink light surged, crackling where their mouths met‚Äîthe hideout‚Äôs light bulbs flickered, a gentle pulse syncing with her power, shadows swaying as warmth bloomed. His hand slid to her cheek, fingers tracing her jaw; hers rested on his chest, feeling his heartbeat through his shirt‚Äîsparks danced off her skin, a faint pink glow brushing his sleeve, singeing it lit. He deepened the kiss‚Äîsoft still, but sure‚Äîher power hummed against him, a quiet current they shared.

Bulbs settling‚Äîher pink hair framing her face. She smirked, voice rough‚Äî‚ÄúBetter watch that sleeve, hotshot, I might singe you next time.‚Äù He grinned, thumb lingering on her cheek, eyeing the faint burn‚Äî‚ÄúYou're worth the burn, *Sparkplug*‚Äù‚Äîand the night simmered, the warehouse raid a distant hum behind their quiet fire.

Dawn crept through the boarded windows, gray light spilling over them. Krolyat stirred on the blanket, pink hair splayed wild, blinking at Zane as he tugged on his trench coat, .45 holstered, fedora shadowing his grin. ‚ÄúWork calls, don‚Äôt burn the place down. I‚Äôll see you later *Sparkplug*‚Äù he murmured, brushing her cheek before slipping out, the door creaking shut. At the precinct, the air thrummed‚Äîphones buzzing, coffee stale‚ÄîZane strode in, matchstick in his teeth, shrugging off the night. Rylie stood by her desk mid-call, voice clipped: ‚ÄúYeah, Razor Street‚Äîget me the logs.‚Äù She glanced up, phone pressed to her ear‚ÄîZane waved, casual, her nod tight, years of partnership flickering unspoken as she turned back to the line.

Rylie, Zane‚Äôs partner, was a blade honed by years in the force‚Äîcropped blonde hair framing a sharp jaw, hazel eyes that cut through bullshit like a laser, her slim frame taut in a leather jacket worn soft from busts and brawls. She‚Äôd been his shadow since academy‚Äîfive years of late-night stakeouts, bar fights broken up with a barked ‚ÄúStand down!‚Äù, and cases cracked over cheap coffee in the precinct‚Äôs flickering break room. She was good‚Äîdamn good‚Äîher instincts rivaling Zane‚Äôs, her aim steady, her mind a trap for details. But she‚Äôd loved him quietly forever, a secret stitched into every glance‚Äîhis cocky grin, his easy charm lighting up drunks and informants, never her. She‚Äôd buried it, played the friend, the partner‚Äîuntil Krolyat.

She saw it unravel‚ÄîZane‚Äôs late nights, his evasions slipping through her questions like smoke. ‚ÄúWhere are you going, Zane?‚Äù she‚Äôd ask, voice casual but edged, leaning on his desk as he shrugged into his trench coat. He‚Äôd flash that grin‚Äî‚ÄúJust chasing a hunch, Ry‚Äù‚Äîand duck out, leaving her with a half-empty coffee mug and a knot in her gut. Whispers of ‚Äú*Sparkplug*‚Äù drifted back‚Äîsoft, reverent, a name he‚Äôd never used for her‚Äîstoking a jealousy she couldn‚Äôt shake.

Rylie watches Zane take to his desk, scribbling notes on ‚Äúthe spark‚Äù file‚Äîtorched stashes, pink light rumors‚Äîwhen his phone beeped. After a brief glance and he stood quickly, coat flapping, grabbing his .45. ‚ÄúHeading out early,‚Äù he muttered, avoiding her eyes, that matchstick rolling in his teeth.

Rylie leaned back in her chair, arms crossed, hazel eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúWait, you just got here. What‚Äôs the rush, Zane?‚Äù Her tone sharpened‚Äîhalf tease, half probe‚Äîwatching him fidget with his collar.

‚ÄúJust some legwork,‚Äù he said, too quick, grin forced. ‚ÄúNothing big, I‚Äôll catch you tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúLegwork my ass,‚Äù she shot back, chair creaking as she stood. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been ghosting me for weeks. What‚Äôs going on‚Äîwho‚Äôs this ‚Äò*Sparkplug*‚Äô you keep mumbling about?‚Äù Her voice dropped, a mix of hurt and steel, fingers tapping her holstered pistol.

He froze, mid-step‚Äîgray eyes flicked to her, then away. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre imagining things, Ry. Get some sleep.‚Äù He bolted for the door, leaving her staring at his empty desk, the file splayed open‚Äîpink scorch marks sketched in his notes. Her jaw tightened‚Äîyears of trust, and he was hiding something. Someone. She grabbed her coat, resolve hardening‚Äîshe‚Äôd find out.

Rylie parked her beat-up sedan two blocks from Razor Street, rain hammering the windshield, her hazel eyes sharp with resolve‚Äîshe‚Äôd tailed Zane, no backup, her gut churning with betrayal. She slipped out, leather jacket soaked, boots splashing through puddles as she moved through the shadows, the warehouse‚Äôs faint glow guiding her. The side hatch creaked‚Äîshe burst in, gun drawn, catching Krolyat and Zane mid-heist‚ÄîKrolyat prying a crate of neon-blue synth-drugs, Zane covering her with his .45, his grin soft: ‚ÄúSeven minutes‚Äîtold you, sparkplug.‚Äù

Rylie‚Äôs voice cracked like a whip‚Äî‚ÄúZane, what the hell?!‚Äù Her pistol trained on Krolyat, hazel eyes blazing. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a damn criminal‚Äîyou‚Äôre with her?!‚Äù

Zane froze, .45 lowering‚Äîguilt flickered in his eyes. ‚ÄúRy, wait‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Rylie snapped, stepping closer, gun steady. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going down‚Äînow!‚Äù Her voice broke‚Äîjealousy, betrayal, years of loving him silently spilling out. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre throwing everything away for this freak!‚Äù

Krolyat spun, pink hair whipping, eyes wide‚ÄîMara‚Äôs ‚Äúfreak‚Äù echoed in her skull‚Äîpanic surged, her power exploding. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a freak!‚Äù she screamed, neon-pink flaring‚Äîa bolt lashed out, sharp, wild, striking Rylie‚Äôs chest. Pink light seared‚Äîher coat smoked, body jerked‚Äîshe collapsed, heart stopped, rain pooling red around her still form on the concrete.

Zane‚Äôs scream shattered the dark‚Äîa raw, guttural howl that clawed through the rain‚Äî‚ÄúWhat have you done?!‚Äù He lunged, dropping beside Rylie, his .45 skittering across the floor forgotten. His hands‚Äîshaking, slick with rain and her blood‚Äîpressed her chest, CPR frantic, desperate. ‚ÄúRy, come on‚Äîbreathe, damn it!‚Äù he choked, voice splintering, each pump a plea‚Äîribs creaked under his palms, but her heart wouldn‚Äôt kick. Blood smeared his trench coat, his gray eyes wild, darting from her pale face to the smoking hole where life had been. Five years‚Äîpartners, friends, her quiet strength‚Äîslipping through his fingers, and he couldn‚Äôt stop it.

Krolyat stumbled back, neon-pink sparks spitting from her hands‚Äîuncontrolled, wild, lighting her pink hair in a frantic halo. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚ÄîI‚Äôm sorry!‚Äù she sobbed, voice breaking over the storm, tears streaming down her sharp cheeks, mixing with the rain. Mara‚Äôs ‚Äúfreak‚Äù screamed in her skull‚ÄîRylie‚Äôs collapse mirrored that cold alley, her mother‚Äôs lifeless sprawl‚Äîguilt tore her open, a wound she couldn‚Äôt zap shut. She reached out‚Äîsparks flaring‚Äîthen froze, hands trembling, her pleas drowning in the chaos. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean‚ÄîZane, I‚Äî‚Äù

He wouldn‚Äôt hear it‚Äîhis head snapped up, eyes burning through her, wet with rage and grief. ‚ÄúGet out!‚Äù he roared, voice a jagged shard, shattering against the warehouse walls. ‚ÄúYou destroy everything‚Äîlook what you‚Äôve done!‚Äù He cradled Rylie closer, her head lolling against his chest, his bloody hands clutching her coat‚Äîhis ‚Äú*Sparkplug*‚Äù turned poison, her pink light a curse he couldn‚Äôt unsee. ‚ÄúGo‚Äîjust GO!‚Äù The shout broke into a sob, his forehead dropping to Rylie‚Äôs, rain streaking his face, a man unmade.

Her neon erupted‚Äîa violent surge, pink light flooding the dark, crackling like a dying star. The air screamed‚Äîtore open‚Äîa jagged portal ripping from nothing, its edges pulsing gray, decayed, a void beyond that sucked at the light. The warehouse trembled‚Äîcrates rattled, the bulb burst, glass raining down‚Äîher power a storm of guilt and despair. She stumbled toward it, boots slipping in the wet, tears streaming‚Äîher pink hair glowed, a beacon in the chaos. She glanced back‚Äîone last, shattering look‚ÄîZane cradling Rylie, head bowed, his trench coat dark with blood and rain, his broken mutter of ‚Äú*Sparkplug*‚Äù barely audible, a ghost of what they‚Äôd been. Her chest caved‚Äîlove, trust, gone‚Äîswallowed by her own ruin.

Pink light flared brighter‚Äîblinding, searing‚Äîwrapping her in its howl. She stepped through, the portal‚Äôs gray maw snapping shut behind her‚Äîsilence fell, heavy, final. Zane knelt alone, Rylie‚Äôs weight in his arms, rain drumming a requiem, his ‚Äúsparkplug‚Äù lost to the void, leaving only echoes and ash.

This one‚Äôs not mine‚Äîit‚Äôs about my childhood friend Adi and his dad, a tale that‚Äôs been brewing since our school days. It‚Äôs got heart, a touch of dust, and a roar that‚Äôs hard to forget.Adi and I grew up thick as thieves‚Äîsame classrooms, same pranks. His dad, Uncle, was a teacher‚Äîsoft-spoken, firm, the kind who‚Äôd nudge us to hit the books harder. But every so often, over snacks at Adi‚Äôs place, he‚Äôd drift into stories about his old biking days. He owned an OG Yezdi Roadking back in the day‚Äîrugged, untamed, a legend that ruled Bollywood chase scenes and rough trails alike. Uncle‚Äôs eyes would spark as he‚Äôd talk about tearing through dirt tracks, the wind howling past. That Roadking was his pride, his wild side. Now? It‚Äôs parked in their lot, caked in dirt, untouched for years‚Äîa relic he always meant to restore but never got around to.Those tales stuck with us. So when Uncle‚Äôs 60th birthday rolled around last month, Adi and I started scheming. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still got that bike bug,‚Äù Adi said, sipping coffee. ‚ÄúThe Roadking‚Äôs just sitting there‚Äîhe‚Äôd love something that brings it back.‚Äù We toyed with fixing up the old beast, but then we spotted the re-launched Yezdi Adventure in a showroom. It‚Äôs got that vintage soul‚Äîraw, gritty, ‚Äúold is gold‚Äù vibes‚Äîbut modernized, ready to roll. Adi smirked, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd ride it, and‚Ä¶ okay, I‚Äôd ride it too.‚Äù A father-son match made in two-wheeler heaven. Uncle might not hit the trails hard these days, but the nod to his past? Perfect.We dove in‚Äîscoped out showrooms, test-drove the Adventure, and fell for its growl. Down payment sorted, finance lined up, we aimed for delivery on his big day. But the loan lagged, and the bike didn‚Äôt make it in time. No sweat‚Äîweekend works, we figured. Adi, though, had a trick up his sleeve. He lured Uncle 20 kilometers out to a quiet highway stretch with some vague excuse. ‚ÄúTry this,‚Äù he said, unveiling the Adventure. Uncle took it for a spin‚Äî15 kilometers of pure joy. ‚ÄúThis thing‚Äôs unreal,‚Äù he said, grinning ear to ear, hands tracing the frame like it was his old Roadking reborn.Then Adi hit him with it: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs yours, Dad. Home forever.‚Äù Uncle froze, then that grin turned teary. ‚ÄúYezdi‚Ä¶‚Äù he murmured, voice thick, like he was meeting an old pal after decades. I‚Äôll never forget it‚Äîpure, wordless happiness. He didn‚Äôt restore the Roadking, but this? This was better‚Äîa modern echo of his glory days.This isn‚Äôt about a bike, not really. It‚Äôs about digging up a dream and handing it over, no ‚Äúperfect moment‚Äù required. I‚Äôm proud of Adi‚Äîhe didn‚Äôt just gift a ride; he gave Uncle back a piece of himself. Now they‚Äôre plotting trails together, that Adventure ready to kick up dust where the Roadking left off.

The keto diet has taken the nutrition world by storm, promising weight loss and improved metabolic health through a low-carb, high-fat approach. But when it comes to milk, many keto enthusiasts find themselves scratching their heads. Is milk a friend or foe to your ketogenic lifestyle? The answer isn't as straightforward as you might think. Different types of milk can have vastly different impacts on your ketogenic goals, and understanding these nuances can make a significant difference in maintaining ketosis. Click here to learn more for a healthier you: https://customketodiet.myofferdeals.com

Understanding Milk and Keto Basics

Not all milk is created equal when it comes to the ketogenic diet. The primary concern is the carbohydrate content, which can quickly derail your carefully planned keto macronutrient ratios. Most traditional cow's milk contains natural sugars that can potentially kick you out of ketosis. However, this doesn't mean you have to completely eliminate dairy from your diet.

Types of Milk and Their Keto Compatibility

1. Whole Milk: Not Keto-Friendly
Whole milk contains approximately 12 grams of carbs per cup, making it a poor choice for those following a strict ketogenic diet. The high sugar content can easily disrupt your metabolic state of ketosis.

Alternatives to Traditional Milk

**Keto-Friendly Milk Alternatives**
‚Ä¢ Unsweetened almond milk
‚Ä¢ Coconut milk
‚Ä¢ Macadamia nut milk
‚Ä¢ Heavy cream
‚Ä¢ Unsweetened soy milk

Nutritional Breakdown of Keto-Friendly Milk Options

Unsweetened Almond Milk
A popular choice among keto dieters, unsweetened almond milk typically contains only 1-2 grams of carbs per cup. It's low in calories and provides a creamy texture for coffee, smoothies, and cooking.

Coconut Milk Considerations
Full-fat coconut milk can be an excellent option for those on the keto diet. It's rich in medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which can help support ketosis and provide quick energy.

Scientific Insights into Milk and Ketosis

Research shows that the key to maintaining ketosis is carefully monitoring your carbohydrate intake. According to a 2018 study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, consuming more than 50 grams of carbs per day can potentially disrupt ketosis for most individuals.

Practical Tips for Milk Consumption on Keto

1. Always choose unsweetened varieties
2. Check nutrition labels carefully
3. Measure your portions
4. Consider full-fat options
5. Experiment with alternative milk types

Potential Pitfalls to Avoid

Watch out for flavored or sweetened milk alternatives that can contain hidden carbohydrates. Even seemingly innocent plant-based milks can contain surprising amounts of sugar that could compromise your ketogenic diet.

Making the Right Choice for Your Keto Journey

The best milk for your keto diet depends on individual metabolic responses and personal nutritional goals. Some people can tolerate small amounts of dairy, while others may need to avoid it completely. Consulting with a nutritionist can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific health needs.

Expert Recommendations

Most keto experts recommend sticking to milk alternatives that contain less than 2 grams of carbs per serving. This ensures you can enjoy a creamy beverage without risking your state of ketosis.

Final Thoughts on Milk and the Keto Diet

Navigating milk choices on the keto diet doesn't have to be complicated. By understanding the carbohydrate content of different milk options and choosing wisely, you can still enjoy creamy beverages while maintaining your ketogenic lifestyle. Remember that individual responses vary, so it's essential to monitor your body's reaction and adjust accordingly. The key is finding a sustainable approach that works for your unique nutritional needs and health goals, ensuring you can enjoy your diet while working towards optimal wellness.",1,1743770337.0,customketodiet1,0,1.0,False

Not thinking much of it because it was the middle of the night, I just flipped it up, went to the bathroom, and flipped the switch off when I returned. The fan was still moving but stopped after I flipped the switch to the off position that it was originally in when I woke up. I went back to bed and slept till morning.

Morning comes, I go to make my coffee and then go back to my room while it brews. Head back to kitchen and notice a hand towel hanging from the stove that wasn't there the night before.

1jrannf,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1jrannf/my_date_called_me_low_class_and_i_walked_out_of/,My date called me ‚Äúlow class‚Äù and I walked out of dinner last night,"This week was my Birthday - after a whole day celebrating, I was waiting at a bus stop to go home when a guy approached me. I was quite impressed by his confidence so I gave him the time of day. Initially, I thought he was attractive, softly spoken, somewhat interesting and confident. I had a wonderful Birthday so it was just a bonus that a hot guy approached me! I was in a particularly giddy mood as I can‚Äôt believe I made it to 33 (I have health issues so it‚Äôs just a bonus I am in relatively good health this decade so far). We made plans to meet up the next day as he was flying back to the States.

On our date, he seemed kind, funny, interesting. We just went for a coffee in a park and chatted for hours. I thought we had a great connection - so much so, he even moved his flight to next week so he could spend more with me which I was touched by. 

When he was trying to amend his flight, a conversation with a friend of his popped up and I could see a photo of me that he must have found online. I asked him what he‚Äôd said to his friend but he suddenly got really shy and didn‚Äôt want to share it, citing that it was embarrassing. I thought he said something complimentary. How wrong I was. After drinks at a hotel bar, he asked me to go for dinner. I declined initially but I thought ‚ÄúOK since he‚Äôs not going to be in the country for longer‚Äù. At dinner, I pressed him on what he told his friend the night we met.

Cue my shock when I read that he‚Äôd said to his friend that apparently I seemed ‚Äúslightly lower class but intellectual‚Äù.

I was obviously so shocked and winded. He said that on my BIRTHDAY! The night we met. He also said I ‚Äúhad a huge ass‚Äù. His friends arrived that same minute. I confronted him in front of his friend and his friend‚Äôs girlfriend as they arrived at our table who looked as shocked as I felt. I left immediately. 

Now am I in the wrong? I think I stood up / showed up for myself and have enforced boundaries going forward that I‚Äôd prefer if I could cut communication. We had plans to meet today but tbh I don‚Äôt think I want someone like that in my life. I don‚Äôt want an unkind, classist partner not now and not ever. I also got diagnosed with a life-limiting disability so I do want someone who is empathetic, kind, patient and won‚Äôt mock me for being ‚Äúlow class‚Äù.  It also doesn‚Äôt help that my contract ended last month so he thinks even less of me that I don‚Äôt have a job right now.

Just to confirm, I wasn‚Äôt insulting to waiters / wait staff, I didn‚Äôt spit, I didn‚Äôt get violently drunk (I didn‚Äôt even drink!). I just had a matcha latte in a park with him, non-alc drinks at a hotel bar and was heading to dinner to meet his friends. Not sure what‚Äôs so low class about that? Not that I need to defend myself but I went to two excellent universities, I read books, am interested in other cultures/cuisines, go to art galleries and exhibitions and treat people as kindly as I can (if they‚Äôre a cleaner or a CEO). 

He then spent the entire evening trying to rationalise what he said over WhatsApp, citing that the meaning ‚Äúlow class‚Äù differs in the UK to the USA. But does it? Being unkind and lacking respect is the same the world over. He did apologise but IMO I would have had more respect for him if he‚Äôd actually said ‚ÄúI said something hurtful and judged you without getting to know you and I don‚Äôt stand by that‚Äù.

I should mention I‚Äôm a woman of colour and he‚Äôs white but not sure how much that plays a role in this.

Later In my 30s I began to make sense of it more and process what really happened .. 

This post is essentially some of what I can recall as well as a bit of a trauma dump cos a lot is coming back to me again sadly and I have to write about it. It helps. 

I‚Äôm likely gonna edit the post a few times so just bear with me and read with Caution

‚ö†Ô∏è 

I had a  boss once who essentially was trying to groom me and sexually harassed me / grabbed my as s often, calling my skinny jeans my ‚Äúcome get me somes‚Äù insinuating ‚Äúcome get me some sex‚Äù 

He would  even go on to joke once about üçá-ing me & would watch actual  üåΩ in the shop or disturbing vids - 1 guy 1 jar or ‚Äúcake farts ‚Äú ‚Ä¶ for example ‚Ä¶ - _ - 
& often times he liked Share his s3x life with us etc. going on to tellus in detail accounts of his past relations with people. 

I was 1 month out of high school at this point in my life (18h Him? 41.

I always thought that, Quite frankly his TMI was never  not appropriate for the work place. But I didn‚Äôt understand 

To add - He was insanely sexist, racist and homophobic. Often complaining about his an ex who was gay after he was with her‚Ä¶ 

I also witnessed him once tattoo a logo for a band called skrewdriver (I believe they‚Äôre a neo natzee band) on some guy. 

& not to mention his h8tred for  woman because he h8ed me & I‚Äôve seen his record‚Ä¶
His girl at the time called the shop once crying to me bout him, to me of all ppl - about his actions, and his drvg use (despite him ‚Äúh8ing dvigs‚Äù cos it would give his shop a ‚Äú bad reputation‚Äù) 

He h8ed gay people it seemed too cos he often talked down about my gay brother who was also only 16 at the time. He loved the F slur. 
He‚Äôd Pick on my clothes , hair , makeup and even my music idk why .. and dear lord he listened to fucckin NUMETAL 
The audacity tbh. 

He was a full blown alcoholic, a closet crack head (yet talked mad sh!t about drvg addicts and looked down on them like I previously mentioned - mad weird .) 

and he smoked cigarettes *INSIDE* the shop daily (against the law- against health codes- uhm literally open skin and blood-and air borne pathogens?! Tf) talk about gross asf 
When we cleaned we just used Clorox bleach sprays . Really no real disinfectant for shops at all . Just bleach. My machines corroded from this- rusted.

 I was his bitch for 2 years running all shop errands(especially when I got my truck) , cleaning up all his messes (including setting up his machines, pouring all his inks, and breaking it all down when done and sanitation and sterilization of all equipment *autoclave*) before disposal tubes and shit ‚Ä¶ the other people that worked and ‚Äúlearned  ‚Äú under him did not have to do this after being hired on. And they made more money than I did. 

He also had me running and  getting his food and cigs and coffee cos he didn‚Äôt drive nor did I (at first)  so I would walk in all weather for his bitch ass EVEN AFTER BEING HIRED AS A TATTOOIST to near gas stations, food places etc. for whatever the little baby needed‚Ä¶
I was beyond disrespected and violated in every way and he took total advantage of me. 

In the end he was 1 of 3 ‚Äú triggers ‚Äú the doctors  words not mine- they said in 2009 in my first psych stay- where I was admitted against my will due to trauma .. lucky me.

I‚Äôd also like to add that  it  is scary that when I share this-many other young people or people in general- come forward and speak about how they  have to 
 or had to endure similar - and I h8 that part 

I also have to add that paid him 3k in 6
Months for the ‚Äúapprenticeship ‚Äú and he claimed I was short ‚Ä¶ -  _  -  and when he was mad he would turn red and veins would pop. He would scream at us but mostly me. During those years he tended  scared me a lot tbh 

While apprenticing - Id gave him damn near my whole check weekly working 7 days a week 2 jobs and 70-80 hours between them both (and one was
To pay for the other so I got $0 most weeks)  . I remember Barely eating, smoking my moms cigarette buts (cos I couldn‚Äô no longer afford
To smoke) , & never going out cos if I called off I risked being Fired. 
This is why I missed skatopia 08-09
I even gave a friend my dad‚Äôs records collection for a ride home from the shop one night.

I also got my own equipment (1.5k) and I figured I‚Äôd have to do that tbh but jfc ‚Ä¶ he honestly did the most to hurt me and others who worked for him during those years  & it feels in retrospect that he this was his intent . 

He ended up rushing my learning months cos he seen me as a money maker for him. 
& when I‚Äôd ask questions about tattooing - how or what he‚Äôd claim I should know that!!  and not explain and make me feel stupid belittling me in turn cos he got a rise from all this weird behavior 

Anything that went wrong in the shop was somehow my fault too - a light fell once and shattered over night near my station (when me and my coworker opened - the mess was there when we came in!) and but next day I was to blame somehow .to elaborate was like the ceilings in school drop ceiling style - the cover for the fluorescent lights fell- shattered- my fault 
- _ -

So in turn I feel now was scammed and taken advantage of as well as used in so many ways while being harassed in the work place cos he was in a position of power and I wasn‚Äôt . 
All while he attempted to groom Me? 

I was at his mercy I felt and I didn‚Äôt wanna fvck that chance at a career up..but I also didn‚Äôt understand a lot. 

Sadly he projected sm Onto me and the other artists it was hard to work with I was always on egg shells in the shop. So My dream job began to crumble before my eyes‚Ä¶. As did I 

I once witnessed him throw a vacuum at my coworker cos he wasn‚Äôt cleaning soon enough.. he made the same coworker tattoo some ridiculous pro DV tattoo flash on him that read 
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make me tell you twice‚Äù
With a cartoon of a woman with a black eye.. wtf
The artist who created the flash sheet I think was William Web- can‚Äôt find the art now however tons of his other shitty work can be found on google‚Ä¶- how convenient 

 This boss I had tho  would go on to seemingly use intimidation tactics to break me of me ‚Äútimid‚Äù ways. He always said that I was timid‚Ä¶ I was a basically a kid..  he also referred to my bf who was POC at the time , as racial slurs and then would ask if I was headed to fvck him for the weekend as I walked to my truck 

.. Actually he often said this type of thing to me. And it now all lives inside my head rent free. 

To add, when I got to driving again- he copped rides from me any chance he could  cos his lisence was suspended for DUIS AND NOT PAYING CHILD SUPPORT 

he was even jailed for that when working with him‚Ä¶..

Fvckin a man 

Life can truly be a rollar coaster and really just saying- if ur going thru it especially at work- and if it feels wrong or if ever u feel violated- speak up . 
Cos I truly regret not but I also do not blame myself any longer 
I go to therapy now and yadadada 
But just like- you‚Äôre not alone if this story sounds similar 
And I know help is available I just was humiliated and honestly didn‚Äôt know better 
So in the end i paid with my mental health . I really hope no one ever has to go thru This shit cos it sticks with ya sadly . And I am working on it not‚Ä¶ but it takes time I‚Äôm Finding out.

But If u read this far Thank u for reading sm and sorry ahead of time if I don‚Äôt reply to comments 
And I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm scattered and bad at writing just ugh ! It‚Äôs some days it can be a black cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è I can‚Äôt seem to shake 

Can‚Äôt go back now can only go forward just so blessed to honestly have made it out of that with only the shit that did happen cos my god it could have been sm worse .

1. which wood would you recommend on using for the shelf? I‚Äôve read that plywood may show streaks after sanding/priming/painting (going to a big box store)
2. how would you go about screwing the shelf onto the bottom frame? Not looking to have it support much weight at all
3. 80, 120, 180, 220 - is that too extreme before painting a fresh coat? I‚Äôm going to be painting it white again

I have a Barista Touch Impress, and I have no issues getting a decent coffee from freshly roasted beans.

However, when it comes to getting a decent one from beans from the supermarket, it tastes horribly.

I do the Intelligent Brew adjustment after changing beans, but the taste is terrible. I have tried beans from Lavazza and Starbucks, dark roast, medium roast, tried mixing dark and roast, dialing the grinding size, playing with the temperature, but I could never even get close to get something drinkable.

I live in Japan, and freshly roasted coffee here is pretty expensive, so I would like to be able to get something drinkable from cheaper beans.

Sometimes, I even get a smell and taste that reminds me of some chemical substance, it's just weird.

---

Hello Redditors!

In today‚Äôs ever-evolving business landscape, sustainability is more than just a buzzword‚Äîit's a guiding principle that shapes corporate strategy and reporting. Whether you are a seasoned CSR professional or a newcomer in the sustainability arena, understanding effective sustainability reporting and strategic communication is essential. Let‚Äôs dive into a comprehensive guide based on robust frameworks and practical examples, fine-tuned for crafting engaging, insightful content that can captivate audiences both online and offline.

### üìä **Crafting Comprehensive Sustainability Reports**
To create impactful sustainability reports, one must focus on several key components:

- **Identify Material Issues:** Start by spotlighting the issues most significant to your stakeholders, such as climate impact and resource use[1]. This focus ensures your report‚Äôs relevance and resonance with its intended audience.

- **Deploy Global Frameworks:** Rely on globally recognized frameworks such as GRI or CSRD[1] to lend credibility and transparency. These frameworks not only ensure compliance with industry standards but also provide a structured approach to your reporting.

- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Involve stakeholders throughout the reporting process. Solicit their feedback and incorporate their insights to enhance the report's credibility and impact[1]. Engaging stakeholders creates a sense of ownership and collaboration.

- **Prioritize Clarity and Actionable Insights:** Use visuals, straightforward metrics, and actionable insights to maintain readability[2]. Clear communication fosters understanding and encourages action.

*Example post:*  
""üåç Building a sustainability report? Focus on what truly matters to your stakeholders. Leverage frameworks like CSRD for global alignment and engage your stakeholders for deeper insights. #SustainabilityReporting #ESG""

---

### üîÑ **Implementing a Strategic Sustainability Framework**
To ensure sustainability efforts are both strategic and effective:

- **Leverage HBR's Four Lenses Framework:** Align sustainability efforts across stakeholder influence, scientific evidence, business value, and ethical responsibility[3]. This approach prevents scattergun strategies and focuses resources effectively.

- **Learn from Case Studies:** Take a cue from innovative initiatives like Keurig Dr Pepper‚Äôs eco-friendly coffee pods, which tackled material issues like waste reduction and ethical sourcing[3]. Real-world success stories can serve as inspiration and guidance.

*Example post:*  
""üß† Strategic sustainability ‚â† random acts. Look through the **4 lenses**: stakeholders, science, business, ethics. KDP‚Äôs eco-friendly coffee pods show how focused efforts lead to real impact. #BusinessStrategy #CircularEconomy""

---

### üìà **Enhance Social Media Reporting**
Social media strategies can be optimized with thoughtful reporting:

- **Audience-Centric Reports:** Customize your reports for the intended audience. Marketing teams thrive on campaign data, whereas leadership focuses on conversions and ROI[2].

- **Utilize Visuals:** Visual elements like charts and screenshots can vividly highlight key achievements[2]. Accompany visuals with clear narratives for maximum impact.

- **Conclude with Actionable Goals:** End with SMART goals like ‚ÄúIncrease branded content by 15% this quarter‚Äù to provide direction and focus[2].

*Example post:*  
""‚ö° Want action-driven reports? Curate metrics for your specific audience. Use visuals to showcase achievements and set clear goals for future growth. #SocialMediaStrategy #Analytics""

---

### üì∞ **Mastering the Art of Press Releases**
Crafting compelling press releases involves:

- **Concise Information Delivery:** Follow the 5W+1H model (who, what, where, when, why, and how) in your opening paragraph to hook your reader immediately[4].

- **Bullet Points and Data Inclusion:** Use bullet points for easy scanning, coupled with quantifiable data for credibility[4].

- **Incorporate Authentic Quotes:** Authentic quotes from company leaders add a layer of trust and reliability to your narrative[4].

*Example post:*  
""üöÄ Writing press releases that capture attention is all about clarity. Start with the *why* and back it up with data and authoritative quotes. #PRStrategy #PRProTips""

---

### üå± **Achieving Environmental Sustainability Goals**
Room for improvement in environmental sustainability can be navigated through:

- **Adhering to the UN SDGs:** Goals such as clean water, climate action, and sustainable cities provide a roadmap for actionable targets[5]. Translate these into achievable objectives within your company or community.

- **Case Study Emulation:** Model after SNHU‚Äôs balanced approach across academics, operations, and community engagement for a comprehensive sustainability plan[5].

*Example post:*
