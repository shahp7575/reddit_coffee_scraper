I would love any recommendations from fancy tasting menus to solid mid-range to super casual from fellow foodies. Only thing that I would avoid is really high end sushi - I like it but my palate simply isn’t discerning enough to appreciate a $400+ omekase.

","# AITAH for how I reacted when my niece announced she was engaged?

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gmiu9a/aitah\_for\_how\_i\_reacted\_when\_my\_niece\_announced/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gmiu9a/aitah_for_how_i_reacted_when_my_niece_announced/)

I (33m) have a pretty big age difference with my brother (44m). He had a child at 25, which means that I became an uncle at 14. Because we were pretty close in age, I formed a special bond with my niece, Ella (now 18f).

When she was 16, my brother and his family moved away so I've been seeing them less recently, but we keep in touch and catch up at family events.

Last year, at Christmas, my niece told me that she had a boyfriend and told me a bit about him, but I didn't know the guy. He was invited for Easter and a couple of other events, but was never able to make it. When we were planning our mother's birthday, my brother decided to invite Ella's boyfriend so that we could all meet him.

Yesterday was the birthday. I was looking forward to meeting Mark (Ella's boyfriend), but was very confused when I saw her walk in with a man that looked double her age (spoiler alert: he is). She introduced him to me, and I politely smiled but was deep down very concerned. I went to my brother to ask how old Mark was and he told me that Mark is 36, so literally double Ella's age. She had told me that he was ""a bit older"" but I assumed like early to mid twenties, not almost 40. That's when they called us in the living room to share ""exciting news"". Ella showed us a ring and revealed that they were engaged.

I just said ""what the fuck"" and everyone turned around and looked at me like I was crazy. I told them that they were out of their minds if they thought this was normal, that there was no world in which a 30 something should date an 18yo, and that she shouldn't be getting married. All of them accused me of ruining Ella's happiness. Some even said that I was jealous of Mark, which is so fucking disgusting I can't even explain it. I mean, I'm younger than Mark, but never in a million years would I ever consider dating someone younger than 25. They told me that it was perfectly legal as they were both adults, which isn't true because they've been dating for a year and Ella turned 18 7 months ago, and that if they were happy that's all that matters.

I told them that they were sick for allowing this and that he was a predator but they wouldn't listen. I know this isn't my business, but I can't help but fear for Ella. She is young and doesn't really know what she's getting into. I'm really scared of her getting married and being unable to leave him when she realizes how sick it was. I then left and slammed the door, and have been receiving pretty wild messages and calls since then. I don't know if I was wrong for this and am just overreacting, and if I wasn't wrong I don't know what I can do to make them realize how wrong it is. AITAH?

Update 1:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gnm6nm/update\_aitah\_for\_how\_i\_reacted\_when\_my\_niece/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gnm6nm/update_aitah_for_how_i_reacted_when_my_niece/)

If you didn't see my previous post, here's a tl;dr: my niece is 18 and getting married with a man who's 36. They started dating when she was 17. When she announced she was engaged I said that it was wrong that he was so much older than her, but everyone else found it okay.

So I've taken the past 24h to really reflect on all of this, I tried to take in most of the advice in the comments, and here's what I have decided. I don't think that me telling her and everyone that the relationship is weird was wrong, I do however think that I did it wrong and it was pretty harsh because it was in the heat of the moment. But I still find this very creepy and don't think she should get married.

What I've decided to do is:

1. Apologize to her. I sent her a text saying I was sorry for my outburst and that I should've thought it through beforehand. I told her that I never wanted to make her feel like I didn't want her to be happy, and that I loved her very much and had her best interests in mind.
2. Ask her if we could talk about this. I asked if she would be okay and free to hang out and maybe get coffee this week to talk about all of this with a clear head. I really want to try and get her to see why it's weird and that maybe marrying him is not a great choice.
3. Explain myself to my brother. I sent him a text saying that I was sorry for the way I said it, but that I still thought that it needed to be said. I explained to him why I think Mark is a predator and this relationship could have a very negative and damaging impact on Ella.

I'm still waiting on their replies. I'll update when they reply, or when I see Ella (if she accepts), depending on how long it would take.

In the meantime, I really want to thank everyone who gave me advice and was constructive, and really tried to help my niece out of this situation. I also send my best to all of the people in the comments sharing similar stories when they were the teenager getting groomed. I'm so sorry this happened to you and I really hope you're doing better now.

Tl;dr of first posts: My 18yo niece is engaged to a 36yo she started dating when she was 17. No one in the family sees a problem. I asked to meet her to talk about it.

So, following my text (see last post), Ella replied and told me she agreed to meet with me and talk. I just came back from seeing her.

Here's how it went. She asked me what I wanted to tell her and I started explaining that I didn't think her relationship was very healthy, and that no older guy should want to date a teenager. I told her that she was an incredible woman so I wasn't saying it was weird that someone would want to marry her, but that guys my age normally shouldn't even look at a teenager. She wasn't convinced and said that sometimes it's true but sometimes it's okay. I asked her how she would feel if I told her that someone born today could be her future partner, and she said it felt really weird. I also asked her if she would consider dating someone younger than 15, and she said no.

I could see her starting to realize that Mark maybe didnt have the best intentions. I also asked her if she knew about his previous relationship, and she said ""vaguely"" and just told me the girl's name. I asked her if she knew how old the girl was and she said she was 21. I also asked her if she knew that their relationships overlapped and she said that Mark always told her he was single since they met, but she kind of felt like that wasn't true. I told her that since his previous girlfriend was also significantly younger it seemed like he had a thing for younger girls, which is kind of weird.

After discussing that, she told me a bit more about her relationship. She told me she was starting to feel weird about it because of Mark's recent behavior. I asked what she meant and she said that he had been flirting with a lot of girls, who were all also younger, including some of Ella's friends. When she confronted him he sort of gaslit her into thinking it wasn't flirting. He was also making a lot of comments about having children with Ella and how cute it would be to see her raise them. She told me she was absolutely not ready for that and also wanted to go to college and work and not be a SAHM. Because of all of that she was doubting her relationship and I told her that I understood.

She said she was scared of breaking up with him because he had become her whole life recently and she didn't know what she would do without him. I told her that she was surrounded by people who loved her and would be there for her, and that she was a lot more than just Mark's girlfriend. I said that she knew my opinion on it, but that ultimately the choice was hers, and that I just wanted her to be happy. I also said I would be there for her no matter what. She told me that she will try to break up with him this week, and she'll let me know how it goes. I'll edit this post if I have more info.

Also, again, thank you to everyone who gave advice and tried to help us. I really appreciate it.

Edit: Okay so I just want to say, some people in the comments seem to think that this is fake, and you know what, I can understand. And I don't really care, I'm not asking you to believe that my life is real or fake, and it's great that you don't just believe everything you see online. But I just want to say this: there are hundreds of people on here or elsewhere that share similar stories. I'm not really affected by people thinking I'm lying, mainly because I'm not the one in that situation. But some people might be. Some people come on here to share something that might have traumatized them, and the last thing they want is for others to think they're lying. So if you don't want to believe me that's fine, but the next time keep that to yourself. It's fine to not believe something, but you don't have to say it, because it might make other people feel really bad.

Comments where op replied:

''No, basically I was telling her that it was weird for him to date her and she was telling me that she understood that older men dating younger girls can be creepy as a whole, but sometimes it’s just because they’re in love. 

Then I talked for a while about how men our age normally perceive 18yo as literal children, so they don’t go after them unless they’re actually okay with dating children. And when I asked her that question it really hit her and she admitted that maybe it was actually weird. 

And then she talked about all the red flags, but it was kind of unrelated. I think it’s the addition of both of these things that made her really come to the realization that the relationship was a bit weird. 

But what I didn’t say in the post is, this took a really long time. We talked for over 3 hours and what I posted is just a really big summary of all we said. I just tried to keep it short but it wasn’t as quick as it seems to be.''

''To explain this in more details: 

I went through the guy’s socials with my friends a few days ago because we thought there might be other weird things going on and we ended up finding info about his previous relationship (the one right before Ella). 

So Ella told me at Christmas (so december 24th) that they had been dating for “a few months”, but when we searched his Facebook we saw a post wishing happy birthday to a girl who he called his “baby” on December 12th. And this girl appeared in other posts where they were kissing or he was calling her pet names so we assumed she was his gf. Which Ella confirmed afterwards.

And this girl also looked very young. He at one point wrote something about her and said “as soon as you’re done with college”, so we knew she was in college. And she looked between 20 and 25. And Ella then confirmed that she was 21. 

But yeah basically it seemed like he was still with his ex while dating Ella, so I asked her if she knew about that.''

''I also didn’t think she would understand, but I think the many red flags she has been seeing in Mark recently contributed to that a lot

''Were you ever loved if you think looking out for your younger relative makes you creepy? Didn’t you have family members that were there for you growing up? 

''Yeah, my friends and I are currently going through his socials. We’ve done facebook already and found his last ex was around 20-24 and their relationship overlapped with his relationship with my niece… 

We’ve also made multiple fake accounts on dating apps, as 18-22yo to see if he has a profile on there and if so, if he would also go for a younger girl. ''

From its humble beginnings in 2009 to its status as a household name, Bitcoin has not only transformed the way we think about money but has also inspired a global movement of tech enthusiasts, investors, and dreamers.

 

As Bitcoin continues to thrive, its community remains at the heart of its success. Thousands of passionate individuals contribute to the ecosystem, sharing knowledge, creating art, and advocating for the future of decentralized finance. The camaraderie among Bitcoin supporters is palpable, with meetups and conferences popping up around the world, bringing together like-minded enthusiasts who believe in the power of digital currency.

 

This past year has seen Bitcoin reach remarkable milestones, including a surge in mainstream adoption as businesses from coffee shops to tech giants embrace the cryptocurrency as a payment option. With its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees, Bitcoin is quickly becoming the go-to choice for those looking to transact in a modern and efficient way.

 

In addition to its role in commerce, Bitcoin continues to inspire creativity and innovation across various industries. Artists and musicians are exploring the possibilities of NFTs (non-fungible tokens), allowing them to sell their work directly to fans and collectors, all thanks to the underlying blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin.

 

Moreover, Bitcoin has become a symbol of resilience in the face of challenges. From regulatory scrutiny to market fluctuations, the community’s unwavering belief in the potential of Bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against inflation has kept the spirit alive. With ongoing developments and upgrades to the Bitcoin network, the future looks brighter than ever.

 

As Bitcoin approaches its next chapter, one thing is certain: it is not just a cryptocurrency; it is a cultural phenomenon that continues to shape the financial landscape and inspire a new generation of innovators.

Can't believe I actually have a reason to post something on reddit, but here I am.

My wife (41F) and I (42M) have been married for 15 years.

I apparently surprised her by being capable of doing household chores and tasks, which I didn't think much of. My mom always asked me to help out with chores when I was a kid so I didn't think it was beneath me or anything.

I do think I inherited her need to clean excessively, like it's so bad that I can't eat until a mess is dealt with. My Mom is an amazing cook, my Aunt was a literal chef at a fancy hotel and my dad loved having barbeques. It was pretty natural to learn from them and pick up a thing or two.

The only thing I didn't pick up was how to make a decent cup of tea or coffee, I'm genuinely awful at it. It got to a point where I was handling most of the household chores and taking care of cooking, which I prefer anyways since she comes home exhausted.

I've been asking our children (11F and 9M) to do some minor tasks around the house and hopefully teach them this sort of thing too. She has a group of friends who hang out regularly, this time it was her turn to host the group at her home.

I offered to take our children out for the day, and it was all set. Before we left, I had to finish up some things for work. The office space is practically on top of our living room, so I could hear what they were talking about the entire time.

One of the friends asked how she always kept our house so spotless and my wife just bragged about how she was responsible for it all.

Then they all started talking about their gripes with their marriages, a common theme was how unhelpful their spouses were. I felt pretty uncomfortable so I just left the office and went out with the kids.

I came back after they had left for the night and acted as normal until we got to our bedroom. I asked her what was up with that conversation they had and pointed out that I did the cooking and cleaning in our marriage.

She told me not to take it personally, and that she just wanted to fit in with the struggles of her friends. Now I just feel unappreciated, especially since I don't clearly remember any genuine gratitude for what I do from her.

Since then, she's been pretty short with me. She says I'm weaponizing what I'm doing against her and holding it over her head.

I don't expect her to compliment me each time I clean or defend me religiously, just a little 'My husband is pretty helpful actually, he does his share' would be nice. I can't help but feel like her friends think I'm some sort of deadbeat who comes home to relax and neglect her.

# UPDATE: AITA for bringing up just how much I actually do for our household to my wife?

UPDATE: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g9lz2n/update\_aita\_for\_bringing\_up\_just\_how\_much\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g9lz2n/update_aita_for_bringing_up_just_how_much_i/)

I'm pretty shocked this post went as viral as it did, and I tried my best to speak to my wife yesterday.

I just can't believe that this is the woman I married. I tried speaking with her, telling her that what she did wasn't that big of a deal but was still not a nice thing to do.

She didn't like me bringing it up again and just told me to suck it up and stop 'bitching' about one mistake. She apologized, but in a tone that just sounded like she was just tired of dealing with this.

I noticed her getting very heated and on the verge of starting an argument so I backed off and switched to a different topic. I asked if we could adjust our duties at home to be more fair for both of us, since most of our management fell to me.

(I mean pretty much 90% of things like cooking/cleaning, including planning for our date nights or vacations for our family rely on me. I do think it's an issue that she gets to come home and just tell me that she's tired.)

Then she got up in my face, telling me I had no right to lecture her about chore duties when I'm practically at home most of the time. She completely refused to hear me out and basically told me that what we have works best for our situation.

She threw me in my face that she was the money-maker and that balanced everything out in the end. Even this morning she was pretty annoyed with me, coming downstairs in a bad mood.

I'm very sure our kids noticed it too but I drove them to school after they got ready. When I got back I noticed that my wife left her packed lunch on our kitchen counter.

So now I'm sitting here, just feeling like the woman I've known for 15 years hates me.

I guess I'll have to push this issue properly even if she gets angry. She's been ignoring my texts and attempts to call her.

I can't just let her act like this, especially in front of our children.

  
Update2:

I think I'm just done at this point.

I did something I never did before and went into her phone while she slept. We both know each others passwords, so it wasn't really difficult. Some of the cheating comments got to me and I felt pretty paranoid about this situation.

Instead I found a group chat with some of her work friends (different from the other friends she had over). It was just non-stop mockery of me and some of the stuff I did for her.

She told them how embarrassed she feels to be with me and that I dote on her like a parent and don't feel like her husband. The lunches I pack for her are 'humiliating' because I add sweets and other treats I know she likes.

Some of her coworkers teased her about the snacks I have in for her and she admitted to just throwing them out at work. She doesn't have any issue eating them at home, but at work she throws out my baking?

She had some choice words to say about me in her chat, some of which I don't have the courage to type out here. One of her meme pictures was of me on my knees scrubbing a bathroom tile, edited to have some sort of dress on like I was some sort of housewife from the 1960's or something.

I just closed her phone and left.

I confronted her about the chat and the contents of it which got her panicking. I focused on our kids this morning and left her to her own devices, it's not like she would have appreciated a 'Kids lunch' anyways.

Now she's texting me like crazy at the office, but I think I lost all respect for her and what she's become. Not only does she find me overbearing and embarrassing as a husband, but then I find out she mocks me to her friends and exposes some sensitive relationship issues to her group chat.

This will probably be the last update, since I don't think she can come back from this. We'd just celebrated our 15th anniversary last month too, I feel like a loser now after seeing what my wife actually thinks of me.

Update3 :

I know I'm going to get some hate for my decision at the end of this all, but I gave my wife one more chance.

She gave me a real apology for her actions and how she treated me about two weeks ago. In her own words, she let her friend's comments at work and her best friends affect her too much.

My wife wanted to feel included in the groups by playing both sides, one that has a useless husband and one that has a clingy husband. She's not using them as an excuse and did take full responsibility for how poorly she treated me which is a plus.

She suggested some sort of Marriage counselling for us and insisted on doing the planning herself to show me she's dead serious on wanting to make this work. She's copied me in her communications with a counsellor, but it'll still be a while before our first appointment.

She's stepped up in the home too, doing more tasks without me asking. The compliments I used to get have also made a return, so I do feel a little more appreciated.

My wife promised me that she wouldn't lie to her friend group anymore and give me the credit I deserve.

The work friends I don't know about, their opinions on me will forever be as they are even though she talked to them.

Part of this feels disingenuous, since it took us getting into a bad spot for this to happen. Maybe it's just resentment talking.

I just hope this works out for our sake and the kids.

And no, she has not been cheating or had some guy in her ear telling her things. A lot of DM's are asking about that

  
Comments where Op has replied:

''I only have a problem with the work friends, but there's not much I can do. It's not like she can stop communicating with her coworkers or quit her job.''

''W**e both work, she makes about 100k a year while I make around 70k. She earns more but she's definitely not the only income in our household.**

**What makes my job great is that my boss lets me have a lot of flexibility, so I can work from home and take care of the house and kids as long as I give him a heads up.''**

**''**I don't think she could do it, purely because of her job.

I've got a lot of flexibility and leeway with my boss, he knows I'm trustworthy. So he allows me to work from home as long as I give him a heads up beforehand. That allows me to do whatever I need to do at home or handle our children.

She doesn't have that benefit, and genuinely comes home about 6-7pm exhausted.",11,1731427403.0,BORUpdates,6,0.92,False

I'm usually irregular with my cycle usually around 35-45 days. Usually almost pain free periods that last 3-4 days with a normal flow easily managed with regular size tampons, maybe super the first day of it. 

Well this was my first period since starting carnivore. My cycle was 64 days long! And my period the first day was HEAVY. I soaked through a super size tampon in the middle of the night which has never happened in my life. And this morning is the 2nd day, the flow almost completely stopped and I started having pain so severe I almost passed out the first time I felt it. I've birthed 4 children and I'm not a pansy but this is horrible pain. It feels like contractions. I switched to a pad bc I thought maybe it was the tampon even tho I've used themy whole life but that did not help.

Has anyone had this happen after starting carnivore? I'm almost scared to keep doing it bc I don't want this to be my new normal! Any insights are very appreciated. 

Background: I've been carnivore (ish) for about 2 months now. I was strictly carnivore the first month and have since lightened up by adding coffee and some carbs back in. I've intentionally ""cheated"" a few times with sugar to celebrate a big life event.

1gpnwj0,https://i.redd.it/cl9671j4th0e1.jpeg,Surprise Osmofolia Haul,"While Osmofolia has taken a step back from online sales this summer, I had the pleasure of meeting Sab at a local maker’s market a few weeks ago. They were SO kind and clearly so excited to talk perfumery. It sounds as though Osmofolia is gearing up to go back online, so if you’ve been waiting to check them out you may have a chance soon!

Overall, I purchased a few “mystery sets” (one was $20, the other was $30, and both were excellent deals based on quantity/quality of the contents!), an Iso-E solid ($20), and was provided with a few free samples as well! In total, I spent $70 on this haul - more than I typically would in any one haul, but I bought with confidence after smelling just about everything Sab had on their table, haha. 

The mystery sets were cleverly named and perfectly matched the listed vibes. I won’t share the specific names of the sets I purchased in case Sab would like to continue to sell these mystery sets together. They seemed to be pretty unique sets, but I’d hate to spoil the fun for another future shopper on accident! 

Overall, the packaging is excellent - simple, pretty, functional. The full sizes have rollerballs and the samples have reducer caps, so I have yet to overapply or spill anything. 

On to the reviews!

Stratus: wet clay and art supplies? Smelling this I weirdly feel as though I’m in a sun filled, empty art classroom in an old building with creaky dark wood floors. It’s definitely got a “wet” component but not one I’d classify as especially “rainy”. I can, if I think really hard about it, get the crushed plant stem note. Not what I was expecting but I’m weirdly into it? This could develop over time/resting, but so far it stays pretty consistent over the course of its 4-6 hour wear. Very atmospheric and you can tell it’s a high quality scent - it’s just an odd duck! 
FS: Nah, but I’ll definitely enjoy this sample when I’m feeling like a nostalgic atmospheric. 
3/5

Nimbostratus: Huh! People have mentioned that this feels like an older sister to Stratus, but these two go in two completely different boxes in my mind? If she’s an older sister to anyone, it’s Death and Floral’s Amy March and Beth March. Beth is greener, Amy is sweeter/softer, but I suspect if I layered em I’d get something similar to Nimbostratus. This one immediately makes me get the “outside after a storm” scent, making the cloud comparison easier to draw. Petrichor, violets, vetiver. Green and earthy and wet on the first sniffs, but after around 2-3 hours she dries down to something similar to a softer version of Irish Spring soap on me. Nimbostratus is a sexy dirty forest witch, but I’m not sure I am. 
FS: Nah, but I can see this growing on me. I think since I have D+Fs Beth and Amy March this could be redundant in my collection. 
3/5

Cumulus: Hm, I’m not getting wet/rain/clouds/fresh air at ALL with this one at the beginning. Certainly get the vanilla, rice and something powdery, and maybe after a few hours I’ll get a bit more of a fresh air quality. The rice/sweetness is almost too much for me at 20mins-an hour. The throw is more impressive than the other two, but I actually like my perfume to wear closer to the skin so that’s a point against it for me. On the dry down, it’s luxurious vanilla and something powdery, leaning closer to Death and Floral’s The Sweater…, like a more subtle version. Unfortunately that one was also not for me and was passed along. Overall, this fades to a pretty vanilla, but she’s not for me. 
1/5

Cold Brew Single Note (free sample)
In the bottle and freshly applied, this is UNCANNY.  It smells exactly like an iced black coffee, right down to the cold watery ice note. This eventually dries down to a much more subtle cool/watery/just slightly-coffee-y scent that wears super close to the skin. Longevity wasn’t stellar, had to reeeeally sniff after about 2 hours and it was mostly gone by 5 hours, but a pleasant  cold, watery scent remained faintly throughout the day (and I may apply more next time). This is perhaps the most realistic coffee note I’ve ever smelled (and definitely the most realistic iced coffee smell). I’d be happy to reapply throughout the day and am looking forward to experimenting with layering!
FS: I could see it! I’ll definitely enjoy this sample and reassess. 
5/5

Gingerbread Single Note (Free Sample)
Sab very generously threw in a second free sample with my purchase, Gingerbread. This is a hyper-realistic gingerbread scent; there’s sharpness to the ginger, rounded out with sweet, spicy cookie. Ever opened one of those containers of triple ginger snaps from Trader Joe’s? It’s almost better than that. I can tell I’ll be reaching for this a TON during the holidays and in the drearier winter months. I can still get traces of it on my wrist 13 hours after application, but the sillage is right where I like it - if you’re in my personal space, you’ll get a whiff of gingerbread, but if you’re in the next cubicle over I’m not choking you out. Impressed with this one! 
FS: I can definitely see myself reaching for this enough to justify a full size. We’ll see how much is left after the holidays, lol. 
5/5

Geosmin, Full Size
Immediately I am reminded of an Invader Zim Gir perfume from Hot Topic. I think it was called Doom Doom Doom? Square bottle, clear light green fluid, shiny pink cap. My big sister wore it in high school and I was obsessed. So aquatic and clean! She’s not around anymore so this is was an  unexpected sucker punch for me. I’d never heard of this note before and had no idea what to expect, but I really enjoy the scent of this wet in the bottle. As for wear, however, it doesn’t stay very similar to that perfume at all. When wet on the skin, the soil and mineralic quality of this one might make it just too dirty for me. We’ll see how it wears throughout the day. 
FS: Since I’ve already got a full size, I’ll probably hang onto this and not repurchase. I’ll keep it for sniffing when I’m missing my sister. Grief is weird. 
2/5 for practicality, 5/5 for scent memory

24 Hour Drive, Full Size
I get the cinnamon and vanilla immediately, followed by a soft, subtle cannabis. Im wary of cannabis notes but this isn’t overpowering…still, I don’t think I’d wear it to work. Then follows the suede. This one’s sweet and pretty femme; she’s a hot girl in killer suede boots who offers to share her spliff and a stick of Big Red outside a bar after last call. It was a pretty overpowering gourmand at first and I very nearly washed it off. However, the vanilla/tonka chills out quickly, and takes a backseat leaving me with a suedey-spicy smell and the faintest little bit of the gourmand quality. I think if you, like me, are into vanilla scents layered with V+R’s Spicebomb, you’ll like this! If you are super averse to cinnamon-vanilla gourmands and can’t make it through a pretty intense first five minutes of melted cinnamon ice cream smell, I’d skip it. I probably wouldn’t have picked this one out for myself BUT it’s beautiful. I’ll probably destash but I’ve been enjoying a bottle sniff here and there.
5/5 for what it’s doing, but for my tastes more like a 2/5. I don’t know if I can rock this but it’s pretty!

Iso-E Solid, Full Size
It’s Iso-E! Wears close to the skin, has good lasting power (but I do go anosmic to it after a few minutes, which is normal for me & iso-Es). I really enjoy wearing this as a daily cozy scent and layered with other scents. Just a damn good iso-E - a the plain white cotton t shirt of my scent collection. 5/5. 

Asphalt solid, Full Size
I’ll admit, I haven’t don’t a wear test on this, but it sure does smell like asphalt in the pan! It does have a little bit of a citrusy element, maybe? We’ll see if I wind up braving a wear on this… ??/5

1gpnvdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1gpnvdh/i_know_what_happened_to_ashmont/,I know what happened to Ashmont ,"For the past week, I’ve been one of many detectives assigned to the case in Ashmont, South Carolina. A small, quiet town with a population of exactly 5,147, or at least that’s what the road sign used to say. Now, it’s a ghost town—every last soul gone without a trace, as if they’d vanished into thin air. The police department was at a loss, and state authorities were scratching their heads. So they brought us in, hoping a few fresh eyes might uncover what they’d missed.
At first, I’d convinced myself this would be another dead-end case, something that would baffle us for a while, and then we’d all be called away to more “pressing” matters. But that was before I found the journal.
It was stashed under the floorboards of the Twist family’s farmhouse, concealed like a hidden treasure. I remember dusting off the cover, noting the rough, calloused handwriting etched deeply into the paper. A journal kept by Jack Twist, the local farmer, his wife Maria, and their children, Ethan and Jessica. Reading it felt strange, invasive even, like I was peeking into his life through a veil that was too thin. But I had to know. I had to understand what happened here, no matter how strange or impossible the story might seem.
“Go ahead, tell me why everyone vanished,” I whispered to the empty farmhouse as I opened the journal, flipping to the first date that caught my eye. The words seemed innocent enough, the daily thoughts of a farmer who’d lived the same routine for decades. But there was a subtle tension—an unease threading through his words, hidden in the margins.
Journal of Jack Twist – April 21
I woke up at six a.m., just like every other day. Had flapjacks for breakfast, coffee on the side. Syrup was thick and sweet, just how I like it. Got me thinking it’d be even better with chocolate chips, though. Maybe I’ll surprise the kids with some tomorrow. That thought was enough to get my mouth watering.
I can picture him—Jack, a man who worked with his hands, his life defined by the rhythm of planting and harvesting, season after season. I imagine him at the breakfast table, savoring a simple pleasure, his mind half on his family, half on the long day ahead.
By six-thirty, I was out in the fields, preparing the soil. Spread some fertilizer and mixed in the compost. Maria joined me after she got the kids off to school. She’s got a good hand for this work, that woman. Always knows just how much to give to the earth to make it yield what we need.
In his words, I could hear his admiration for Maria. Not the sentimental kind, but the practical, respectful admiration of a man who knew his wife’s worth in a quiet, unspoken way. A family bound not just by love, but by work, by shared purpose.
By seven, the kids were off, and Maria was at my side in the field. We finished prepping the soil by seven forty-five and took a well-deserved break, sipping water and looking over our work. There’s something comforting in the pattern of the rows, each line straight and true.
I paused, picturing the neat rows stretching out across the farmland. There was a rhythm to his life, a sense of order. But life in a place like Ashmont was often quiet and simple, right until it wasn’t.
Around nine, we started planting—corn, soybeans, a few other vegetables. Just enough to keep us through the season and maybe sell a bit extra at the market come harvest. By noon, we stopped for lunch. I had a salad, though I’ll be honest, it wasn’t as good as Maria’s cooking. But work doesn’t wait, and soon we were back to it.
He wrote with a blunt simplicity, a straightforwardness that felt like him. No pretension, no drama—just a farmer doing his job. I admired the way he took pride in his work, though he didn’t exactly say so.
We fed the animals after lunch, kept an eye out for any pests and weeds that might creep in. Spent the rest of the afternoon moving from one chore to the next, checking on each crop, every animal, till it was eight in the evening.
Then came the first sign of something out of place. My eyes widened as I read his next words.
When I went outside after dinner, I saw something strange. Lights in the sky. Bright, almost too bright, moving fast—faster than anything I’ve ever seen. Too close to be a shooting star. At first, I thought maybe it was some military aircraft, though I’ve never seen one come this close to the fields.
I could picture him, standing in the cool night air, the warm glow of the farmhouse behind him, staring up into the darkening sky as those strange lights passed overhead. It must have felt like an omen, a signal that something was coming, though he couldn’t know what.
After that, I didn’t think too much about it. Just went to bed like always.
I closed the journal, leaning back in my chair. It was just an ordinary day on the surface, but beneath the routine, there was a tension building—a feeling that things were about to go very wrong. Jack’s words were plain, unembellished, but they carried weight, a creeping unease that was beginning to settle over me.
Back in the farmhouse, I took a deep breath, glancing around the empty rooms. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. It was silly, of course, but the sense of abandonment here was overpowering. This had been a family’s home, filled with life, warmth, laughter. Now it was nothing but hollow silence.
“What did you see, Jack?” I murmured, running my hand over the rough wood of the table, imagining Jack and Maria sitting here with their children, talking over breakfast, planning their day.
The empty town, the silence, the mystery—it was unsettling in a way I couldn’t put into words.

The journal continued, its pages now feeling heavier in my hands, as if they held secrets that were waiting to burst out. Jack Twist’s words from April 22 left me with a chill that I couldn’t quite shake. His life had followed a strict rhythm, like clockwork. But these entries were different—raw, scattered, his words grasping for something beyond his understanding. I flipped to April 22 and began to read.
Journal of Jack Twist – April 22
Tonight something very weird happened. I saw something tall, human-like, skinny, just standing there in the dark outside. It made strange noises, like nothing I’d ever heard, something almost animal, yet more… calculated. I only got a glimpse, though. When I stepped out for a closer look, it was gone. Very, very strange.
The image of Jack standing on his porch, the night wrapped around him like a heavy blanket, took shape in my mind. I could almost feel his unease—the way his pulse must have quickened as he strained to make out that figure in the dark, watching his every move. It was more than just an intruder; he described it with the kind of dread that seemed to go beyond logic.
Why would someone—something—come all the way out here, in the dead of night, just to disappear the second he came near? The thought gnawed at me. This was more than a routine break-in. Whatever it was, Jack had sensed that this visitor wasn’t of the usual sort.
Journal of Jack Twist – April 23
Today was strange, too. Got up at six a.m., had eggs and bacon with some coffee. The usual. By seven-thirty, I decided to head into town. I needed a few supplies, and, well… I figured I ought to tell someone about what I saw last night.
Jack didn’t say much here, but I could feel his reluctance. In small towns like this, everyone knew each other’s business. To step out of line, to admit you’d seen something “strange,” was almost like asking for trouble. I could imagine him rehearsing his words on the drive, carefully choosing each phrase to sound reasonable.
When I got to the police station, I told the officer, “Someone was on my property last night. Tall, skinny, and that’s all I could make out in the dark.”
It must have taken him a while to get those words out, each syllable feeling heavier than the last, his mind racing with the memory of that figure in the shadows. I could picture the officer looking up, surprised but trying to keep his expression neutral.
The officer nodded, and his response caught me off guard. “It’s strange,” he said, “we’ve been getting a lot of reports about people like that—tall, skinny, trespassing on properties around town. But we can’t figure out who they are.”
The conversation must have left a pit in Jack’s stomach. He hadn’t been the only one to see this figure—or figures. Whatever was happening wasn’t isolated to his farm. There was an undercurrent, a creeping pattern that was starting to emerge, and yet nobody seemed able to make sense of it.
After that, I left the station and headed to the store for supplies. Just before I walked in, I noticed the community board by the door, covered in missing persons posters. It was strange—too many faces looking back at me, too many families with no answers. I couldn’t help but wonder if it was all connected.
Jack’s words were casual on the surface, but they hinted at something darker. Missing people in Ashmont wasn’t unheard of—sometimes people got into bad situations, fell on hard times, or even chose to leave. But this many, all at once? And now the reports of figures moving around the town at night, silent shadows with no clear intention?
I closed the journal and sat back in my chair, tapping my fingers against the table. This case had gone from strange to unsettling in a way I hadn’t quite anticipated. There was a pattern here, a thread that tied everything together, though it was frayed and barely visible. I couldn’t shake the feeling that Jack had seen something that no one was supposed to see. And whatever it was, it wasn’t done with him yet.
Standing alone in the Twists’ farmhouse, I looked around, half expecting one of those tall, dark figures to be lurking in the shadows. The silence was so thick it felt oppressive, as if the whole house were holding its breath, waiting. Outside, the fields stretched out under a gray sky, the crops waving gently in the breeze, indifferent to the troubles brewing around them.
“What were you thinking, Jack?” I murmured, almost hoping for an answer.
The journal was my only connection to his world now, each page a glimpse into his mind as the events of Ashmont began to spiral out of control. And I had the sinking feeling that, in the coming days, Jack’s accounts would only get stranger.

Chapter Three
Jack’s journal for April 23 had a new sense of urgency, a kind of dread that only seemed to grow with each sentence. I could feel his frustration, his helplessness as he tried to make sense of a town that was slowly slipping out of his control. I began to read, feeling the weight of each word as he grappled with the realization that something was very wrong.
Journal of Jack Twist – April 23
I thought yesterday was strange, but today… today was different.
I woke up at six a.m., like usual. First thing I noticed was the darkness—thicker than normal, like it was pressing down on the house. I went to flip on the lights, but nothing happened. Tried again, thinking maybe I’d just missed the switch in the dark. But no, it wasn’t me—the power was out.
Jack must have felt a prickle of unease then, even if he didn’t say it. A simple power outage would have been one thing, but out here, without lights, the familiar farmhouse must have felt different, almost hostile.
So, I figured, alright, I’ll go turn on the generator. That should get things back to normal. But when I tried it… nothing. Not even a hum.
I pictured him standing there, in the dim morning light, a flashlight clutched in one hand as he went to inspect the generator. Jack was a man who understood machines, who could usually find the problem and fix it. But this? This was something he hadn’t anticipated.
Then it got weirder. I pulled out my flashlight, clicked it on, and… nothing. Just dead.
The frustration in his words was clear, and I could almost feel his hands tightening around the useless flashlight, his mind racing as he tried to make sense of it. It wasn’t just the power in the house. Nothing with a battery, nothing electric, was working. Not even his car.
Not even the damn car would start. I tried a few times, just in case. Even hit the hood, as if that would do something, anything. But the engine just sat there, silent, not even trying to turn over. Nothing was working, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that this wasn’t just a regular power outage. There was no damage, no storm, nothing to explain it. So how?
Jack’s mind was analytical; he wanted answers. But what do you do when you can’t even guess the question? That was the feeling he was wrestling with now, the unsettling realization that he might be in over his head.
I knew what I had to do. Had to get into town, see if anyone else was dealing with the same thing. So I grabbed an apple and a protein bar, the kind of breakfast you eat when you’re in a hurry and don’t have time to think about it. And then, well… I hopped on my old bike. Hadn’t ridden that thing in ages, but with the car out, I didn’t have much of a choice.
I could picture him pedaling down the empty roads, the farmhouses he passed equally quiet, almost abandoned-looking without any signs of life or light. It must have felt eerie, his familiar world transformed into something strange and silent.
When I finally got into town, it was as if the whole place was holding its breath. The streets were empty, people huddled in small groups, all whispering to each other, their faces tight with worry. I spotted John and went over. “Hey, what’s happening?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.
I could imagine the look on John’s face, the uncertainty there, as he glanced back and shook his head. “We don’t know,” he replied, his voice low, almost as if he were afraid to say it any louder.
“How is this even possible?” I asked, though I already knew John didn’t have an answer.
“I’m pretty sure it shouldn’t be,” he said. And that was when the mayor stepped up, calling for everyone’s attention.
In his description of the mayor’s announcement, I could hear the disbelief and fear mounting in the crowd. There was a growing sense of urgency, of people searching for someone to blame, or something to hold onto. But the idea of riding fifty miles to the next town, of having to rely on bikes and foot travel just to get help, was almost absurd.
The mayor spoke up, his voice trembling just a little, though he tried to keep it steady. “It seems the radios aren’t working, either. No way to contact anyone. Our only choice, if we want help, is to ride out to the nearest town.”
I pictured the townsfolk, murmuring anxiously to each other, a few gasping when someone reminded them how far the nearest town was. For most people in Ashmont, that fifty miles might as well have been an ocean.
Someone in the crowd yelled out, “The closest town is over fifty miles away!”
The hopelessness in Jack’s words here felt almost contagious, as if the entire town was sinking under the weight of a problem they couldn’t even define. What could they do, really? Who would volunteer to make that journey with no guarantee they’d come back with answers?
A small group finally stepped forward, determined to make the trip in the morning. Chris, one of the volunteers, turned to me and asked, “Wait, don’t you have any horses, Jack?”
I could picture the forced, hopeful smile on Chris’s face, the faint glimmer of optimism, as if a horse might make all the difference.
I shook my head. “No, sorry. Only livestock I’ve got are cows and chickens.”
Jack’s words felt hollow. There wasn’t much comfort to be had in a situation like this. He watched as the group gathered what little supplies they could manage, while he headed back to his bike and began the ride home. I could imagine him pedaling down that empty road again, his thoughts swirling with unanswered questions, each one more unsettling than the last.
When I got back, I told Maria and the kids about the plan. “Tomorrow, we’ll head into town. We’ll stay at a hotel until the power comes back on.” I tried to sound confident, like this was just a temporary inconvenience.
But there was an edge to his words, a hint of desperation. Jack was trying to reassure his family, but he couldn’t even reassure himself. He must have felt it, that creeping sense of dread as he fed the animals, noting how quiet they were, as if even they sensed something was wrong.
As I finished up the chores, it hit me that the fridge wasn’t working, either. And I couldn’t help but think—if all this food goes bad, I’m going to be furious. Just one more damn thing to worry about.
There was an almost resigned tone in those last words, as if Jack had no choice but to laugh bitterly at the absurdity of it all. He’d been preparing for this new season, planting crops, making plans, only to have everything thrown into disarray by something he couldn’t even understand.
The feeling of isolation hung heavy in the air as I finished reading. The situation was spiraling out of control, and Jack’s voice reflected a mix of anger and fear as he clung to the normal routines of his life, even as they were slipping through his fingers. The small-town world he knew was changing, becoming something unfamiliar and dangerous, and he was powerless to stop it.
I closed the journal and stared at the empty fields outside the window, imagining them under the heavy, unnatural darkness that Jack had described. The silence around me felt more oppressive than ever, as if something were waiting, just out of sight.

Chapter Four
This final entry from Jack Twist’s journal was perhaps the most chilling thing I’d read since I’d arrived in Ashmont. The desperation in his words, the panic, the sense of inevitable doom—it all made the hairs on my arms stand up. I closed my eyes and tried to imagine Jack writing those words, alone and frightened, knowing he’d likely never leave that town alive.
Journal of Jack Twist – April 24
Nothing much happened today. The group left on their bikes, and I can only hope they’ll return tomorrow with help. Maria, the kids, and I spent the day in the hotel, watching the hours tick by. The water’s out too, so we’re drinking from water bottles. Another problem we don’t have a solution for.

Jack’s frustration felt almost tangible here, as if he were forcing himself to stay calm despite knowing that everything around him was falling apart.
Journal of Jack Twist – April 25
They didn’t come back today. I keep telling myself it’s probably just slow going, maybe they’re camping out for the night somewhere along the way. Still… something doesn’t feel right.
Journal of Jack Twist – April 26
Another day, and still no sign of the group. People are starting to get nervous—supplies are running low, and the mayor’s been pacing around like he’s got some sort of plan, but none of us believe him. The town’s starting to feel different, like it’s… shrinking.
Journal of Jack Twist – April 27

This was the last entry. Jack’s handwriting was shaky, as if his hands had been trembling as he wrote. I took a breath and continued reading.

If someone finds this journal, please believe me. Please. I know how this must sound, but I have to tell the truth. I went outside this morning, looking for news, hoping to hear that maybe the group had finally made it back. But instead, all I found was frustration, people shouting and pacing, arguing over what little food we had left.
And then, suddenly, one of the radios turned on.

Jack’s words were almost frantic here, his sentences choppy, as if he were reliving the moment as he wrote.

It started with static, just a hiss that filled the room, but then we heard something else. The sound. The same horrible noise from the other night. It was like… like nothing I’d ever heard before, some sort of garbled language, or maybe just noise, but it made my skin crawl. Everyone in the room just froze. We didn’t speak; we didn’t even breathe.
The sound went on for five minutes—five long, horrible minutes—before it cut off again, leaving us in a silence that felt too heavy to bear.
In the afternoon, things took a turn for the worse. Chris came back.
He was alone, staggering into town, and he looked… broken. He wasn’t wearing a stitch of clothing, and he was bleeding. His face was pale, his eyes vacant, like he was somewhere far away. He was muttering, mumbling words none of us could make out, and he looked so hollow, like something had taken every ounce of life out of him.

Jack’s description of Chris painted a haunting picture. I could see him standing there, barely recognizable, his face a twisted mask of pain and confusion. I continued reading, captivated by Jack’s raw fear.

John ran over to him, trying to get some answers. “Oh my God, Chris—what happened to you?!” he asked, his voice trembling.
But Chris just kept muttering, as if he couldn’t even see John. His lips were cracked, his hands shaking. Half of his fingers were missing, and so were his teeth. The doctor finally came over and led him away, but none of us knew what to do. None of us knew what could have done that to a man.
That night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept hearing things outside—whispers, maybe, or footsteps, I wasn’t sure. But then… then I heard it. A loud hum, like a plane, but lower, heavier. I looked out the window, and what I saw…

I felt Jack’s terror here as if I were there myself, staring out into the night.

It was a UFO. Just floating there, silent, like it was waiting for something. I thought maybe I was dreaming, but then I saw the others coming out of their houses, one by one, drawn to the light. We all just stood there, staring up at it, until the doors of the ship opened.
What came out of that thing… they weren’t human. They made that same horrible noise we’d heard on the radio, a language that scraped against my mind.
Jeff, the town’s mechanic, was the first to step forward, his fists clenched. “Hey! We don’t know what you’re saying,” he yelled, his voice bold. “So either start speaking English, or I’ll kick your ass!”
One of them moved toward Jeff, fast, reaching out with a hand that looked more like a claw. It grabbed him and pulled him into the ship, just like that. He didn’t scream. He didn’t even struggle. It was like he was in a trance.
And then his son, ran forward with a knife, screaming. He stabbed one of the creatures, and when he pulled the knife out… there was no blood. Nothing. The creature didn’t even flinch.
One of them took out a device—a metal rod, sleek and strange. It touched Will with it, just for a second, and he… he melted. Just collapsed into a puddle right there on the ground. They scooped him up and put what was left of him into a jar, like he was nothing more than a specimen.
People started screaming, running in every direction, and I did too. I ran, as fast as I could, leaving behind everything—my family, my friends, my home. I don’t know why. I just knew I had to get away. I looked back once, and I could see buildings collapsing, the sky filled with smoke. The screams… I can still hear them.
I don’t know how long I ran, but I ended up here, hiding, hoping they won’t find me. I know it’s only a matter of time before they do. I’m leaving this journal here. If anyone finds it, please… tell my story. Tell them what happened here.
Love, Jack Twist.
I sat back, the weight of Jack’s words pressing down on me. Could this really be what happened in Ashmont? The rational part of me wanted to dismiss it, to chalk it up to psychosis, to fear, to anything but the truth. But as I looked out over the empty town, the eerie silence felt heavier, as if the truth of Jack’s story lingered in the air, in the empty streets, in the abandoned buildings.
There was no evidence of an earthquake. No signs of a mass exodus, of struggle, of anything that could explain the disappearance of 5,147 people. Nothing but Jack’s journal.
And that might just be the most terrifying part of all.",2,1731426830.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

Is it unwise to meet him again? Was I naive for believing his actions over his words? Is there any hope here? And if so, how can I maintain healthy boundaries without fully closing the door?","So, here’s a bit of a background. I’m currently going through a divorce. My husband asked for it earlier this year after we struggled through several difficult life events together (miscarriages). While I was trying to process everything, I met a guy we’ll call “M” on a trip. I wasn’t looking for anything, just visiting some friends in my hometown. He had just processed his divorce after being in a long-term relationship too of 15 years. His partner cheated on him.

I live in Europe, but “M” was based in Asia. I had no plans to dive into anything serious, but “M” was a breath of fresh air. He was kind, transparent, and emotionally supportive in a way I’d never experienced. He’d also recently been through a tough breakup after a long relationship. From the beginning, it felt like the world melted away when we spoke.

We started as friends, but it quickly became something deeper. Within a week, he’d written me a letter describing how he felt I was a soulmate and wanted me in his life. The connection felt genuine, and it grew slowly but intentionally. After I left, he visited me monthly (long international flights). He was consistently thoughtful, sending letters, flowers, and messages to show he was thinking of me. We found that we aligned on pretty much everything—life goals, values, dreams.

Then a couple of months ago, he started pulling away. His work became so ridiculously busy (I know his schedule) and he was applying for the job that he said would ""solve all of our problems"" as it's closer to me. He admitted that he wasn’t developing feelings as he thought he would due to the distance or him ""protecting himself"", which felt completely out of place given how affectionate and caring he’d been. The timing was tough because, due to some complications on my end, we hadn’t seen each other in about two months. We planned a trip together to a neutral city, which was amazing. But his best friend joined us unexpectedly, which changed the dynamic.

I told him how much I cared about him before I left, and he was sweet in response but didn’t say it back which was fine for me. Soon after, he started talking about applying for jobs in a different country, hoping it might “solve our problems.” Despite this, he remained distant, and eventually, he ended things. He attributed it to the long-distance factor and his feelings not changing.

Afterwards, I tried to go no-contact. But with the current state of the world, I felt compelled to reach out briefly. To my surprise, he responded warmly and suggested a call. We talked, and it felt like nothing had changed. He mentioned he didn’t get the job he thought would help us and his health concerns had become more serious. I mentioned that I’d be back in Asia soon, and he immediately suggested we meet for coffee, leaving the decision up to me to “protect my feelings.” I told him that’s my responsibility, not his.

Since then, we had a lighthearted text exchange, and I haven’t reached out further.

So, I’m struggling with a few questions: **Is it unwise to meet up with him again? Was I naive for believing his actions over his words? Is there any hope here? And if so, how can I maintain healthy boundaries without fully closing the door?**",0,1731426718.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

2 1/2 years ago, I (59m) had open heart surgery at Kaiser San Francisco. Surgery went well (obviously) and I had a speedy 3 day recovery. Post surgery, I was so feeble that almost everything requires some assistance. I remember how quickly I got over being embarrassed about others handling my body because everyone was so professional but comforting.

During that time, I had lots of different nurses care for me and every person seemed so deeply committed to my recovery. I wasn't just a task to be completed. It really felt like love.

I smile when I think about the last nurse to help me before discharge. She was a black lady about my age just dripping with southern charm. ""Aww, c'mon hunny. Let's get you showered so you can go home."" I was feeling stronger and wanted to shower in private to regain a little confidence. She started the shower and I shuffled across the room to her encouragement. My plan was to shut the door behind me and shower in private. When I crossed the bathroom threshold, she yanked my gown off like a magician pulls a tablecloth off a fully set dinner table. I was stunned and sat my ass down on the shower bench defeated. She just just kept chatting me up like we were old friends having coffee together. I don't remember her name but I do remember how she made me feel.

","**(A Few Months Prior to Ragnarök)**

""Afternoon, Samson! Wonderful to see you again."" Hohenheim said.

""…Good to be back, Doctor."" Samson said sheepishly. The two were sitting together in a comfortable room. The windows were open to let in the soft breeze and comforting smells of the outdoors. Hohenheim sat in his large, brown cushioned chair while Samson sat on a matching couch, the softness of which he was not a fan of. The room was lined with full bookshelves set neatly in place, barely touching the light-blue walls. Between the two was an ornate black, wooden coffee table complete with a simple, white coffee set. Two cups of fresh, steaming coffee sat on the table.

""I was worried you'd refrain from returning, seeing how our last appointment went.""

""I was out of line; I know you're just trying to help.""

""And as I said before, I will not force it upon you. I would rather you feel safe enough to confide in me rather than feel compelled to say anything. However…I am not that kind of doctor and I may have crossed a line with my own ignorance. For that, I am sorry.""

Samson was not used to situations like this. Battlefields, strategy meetings, brawls, and such were far more his speed. Even more discomforting was his company, who was recommended to him. Calling the act of someone apologizing to him with such sincerity off-putting was an understatement. ""Doctor, please. I don't need the apologies. You and I are okay.""

Hohenheim smiled. He leaned forward and picked up his cup and took a quick sip. He swished a bit in his mouth before swallowing, letting out a content sigh. ""Wonderful. Also, as I promised I made coffee for today. It's a bit richer than what I'm used to, but I think it'll fit your palette nicely.""

Samson stared at him, barely moving an inch. Hohenheim met his gaze without blinking. His calm air flooded the room. Samson could not stand it. ""Why are you doing this? You don't owe me anything. I didn't pay you, no one's making you. I pulled the door off the hinges last time leaving. You should be angry with me."" Panic started settling in. ""Why aren't you angry!?""

Hohenheim sat back, holding his cup carefully as not to drip any coffee on his white shirt. ""To answer your first question, the simple answer is because I am a doctor and because I can. For the second, it's kind of an expectation when dealing with these kinds of things. Tough situations require flexibility and understanding minds. Was it annoying? Yes!"" Hohenheim said laughing softly. ""But expected? Absolutely.""

""So you knew this could happen, but still did it?""

""To sum it up, yes.""

Samson looked down at the coffee cup sitting in front of him. Slowly, he picked it up, and smelled it gently. The scent brought to mind cold mornings back home in Israel, and the warm drinks they would partake of to keep warm. He took a light sip, swished it, and swallowed it. ""That…is pretty good."" Samson said smiling faintly.

Hohenheim smiled with him. ""Now, here's my offer to you, Samson. I have enough coffee to make a few pots. Granted, Mist would be on me like a horsefly saying it's bad for me, but this is one poison I'll gladly take to enjoy good company. We can sit here and enjoy it, or we can do that and talk about what's on your mind…or you can just leave. No hard feelings.""

Samson looked at his reflection in the coffee. Did he always look so tired? ""What do you want to know?""

""Anything you feel comfortable sharing."" He did not know where to start, so Samson began talking about his time before arriving in the Heavens. How he discovered his strength when killing a lion as a child by just crushing its head in a hold, his recruitment into the army by his predecessor Abdon, his wartime accomplishments, His wives Timnah and Delilah, and the events leading up to his death. The rollercoaster of pride, shame, regret, and satisfaction carried Samson through his memories, with Hohenheim there across from him listening intently. Not once did Hohenheim interject. He knew Samson did not need his poking and prodding to share. Souls stuck on the mental and physical battlefields, at least in Hohenheim's experience, needed space to unload and decompress. He was not sure Samson ever talked to anyone about this, especially considering he did not tell his parents about killing a lion and eating honey out of it. *Good God, Samson what haven't you done!?* Hohenheim chuckled mentally.

""And that's about it."" Samson said. He leaned back and stared at Hohenheim. He was scared of what he just did. He didn't know why.

""Samson."" Hohenheim said. ""I'm sure you're aware of your story in the Book of Judges, yes?""

""I am and not too proud of it."" Samson looked to the side. ""I fought for years and made a joke out of our enemies, but my story became a lesson in pride and its consequences.""

""Well, from what you told me it's not that far from the truth. A bit off-track, but close.""

""What do you mean?"" Fear started to grow in Samson's gut.

""Who did your people think of you as? Not your occupation or title, but you.""

Samson dived back into his memories.

""…I don't know. They all adored me because of my victories, and we partied together. I had friends when I joined the army, but we drifted apart.""

""You were a war hero, and one so powerful your enemies had to trick you to get to you.""

""I mean, yeah.""

""However, I confess I don't recall you ever saying anyone thought fondly of you for anything else.""

""What do you mean?""

""I have no doubts you had admirers, but they seemed to admire the icon and not the person. Were you ever able to find affirmation in anything else? I hope that's not a harsh statement about your loved ones.""

Samson pondered on the question. ""No…it's just I don't know. For as long as I can remember, it was always like that. My strength and wit were always what helped me stand out.""

Hohenheim pondered on the response. ""Samson, hear me out on something.""

""What is it?"" Samson asked hesitatingly.

""Even as a youth, you stood out because of your gifts. So much so, you may have over-relied on it."" Samson tilted his head, puzzled. ""If my hunch makes sense, your efforts to stand out amongst your peers brought you the attention you craved, but it was the only thing that mattered to many of your people due to the war.""

""So…I am the cause of all my misfortune?""

""No…just a part of it. Your people found themselves in constant war due to their own actions. It was one of the major struggles you all went through in the infancy of your people. They needed champions., and you fit the role well. As such, it became a feedback loop. You desired recognition, you gained it, your people got a champion, but neither you nor your people realized that you are not just your strength or your role. They are both parts of a greater whole.""

""Those two things did nothing but bring me loneliness and misery in the end.""

""Yes…but only because you tethered your whole identity to them, and poisoned the truth of who you are. There truly is more to you than you know, just like everyone else. And I know a good way to help you do that.""

""…Okay, how?"" Samson had no idea where Hohenheim was going with this.

""My friend Mist is one of 13 sisters. A baker's dozen like no other! She's right there in the middle of them, and sees where the dysfunctions in their relationships can sprout. She's particularly concerned for her younger sisters, especially one named Hlökk. One can best describe her as…""

""A brat?""

""Your words, not mine. It's normal for younger siblings to act out due to a lack of attention. Hlökk's sisters are all too busy with their work, and so I think both of you have something to gain out of you spending time with her.""

""Like what, a play date or something? That's just weird, Doctor.""

""More like a big brother, or mentor kind of relationship. When we're responsible for others, it teaches us about ourselves. I think with this change of roles, you'll figure a few things out. What do you say?""

He really wanted to say no. It sounded like glorified babysitting and Hlökk sounded like the type of kid you'd leave someone with for torture. However, Samson conceded. He took on the role of big brother, then butler after scaring Hlökk during their first interaction. He was terrible at it. Not much good a soldier could do in such a situation, but he learned. He soon mastered etiquette, tea-making, baking, and grooming. Just in time for Brunhilde to meet with him and request his participation in Ragnarök.

Samson took a few deep breaths, and began running towards his dagger. Baldr jumped in between them and sprinted towards Samson. Blood dripped from the inside of his gloves as he ran, something Samson took note of. Both fighters ran through every possible situation of how the next clash would go. Just before Samson was in Baldr's range, he recalled a tactic he used earlier. Changing it up a bit, he dived to the ground and rolled up. Baldr could not react in time and his legs collided with Samson's sturdy frame. Samson could feel his opponent flop over him and took the opportunity. He quickly jumped up and sprinted towards his dagger. Baldr was hot on his trail. Just before he touched the floor, Baldr landed palm first on his left hand. He twisted his body mid-fall, aided by the twisting and grinding of his glove, and landed on his feet and immediately sprinted after Samson. ""Damn it, I thought that would work!"" Samson shouted.

""You're almost there!"" Hlökk shouted. Her voice tinged with panic. Baldr was catching up again. Samson figured adrenaline was keeping him up and helping ignore the pain from his gloves. Samson leaned over and scooped up his dagger, swiping it behind him. Baldr stopped just in the nick of time to avoid a cut across the eyes. The swipe spun Samson around to face his opponent and the two came to a halt. Their bodies lurched and shifted from heavy breathing, both bleeding heavily. The last sprint put both of them on empty and now the endgame was upon them. Neither knew who would win; the grinding spiral or the razor-sharp bone. Not a single word passed between the two as they caught their breath.

*I've never fought someone who can do what you, Samson. These gauntlets...I don't know if they can hold up against that weird power of yours...*Baldr pondered. *As long as I avoid that dagger though, this match is mine!* The two crept slowly towards each other. Their breathing, for the first time in the match, synced up. Neither reached this level before against an opponent. The strain, their aching muscles and joints, their lungs begging for relief. However, for the first time in their lives, they began to feel pure elation unlike anything they ever felt before. No woman, no food, no drink, nothing had ever caused them to feel this type of joy. Only near-death combat against a powerful opponent could birth such an emotion. The emotion began to grow within them both and turned into a powerful, unstoppable high forcing two involuntary actions.

Uncontrollable smiling, and loud roaring. The two attacked. Samson started with a quick thrust and Baldr a jab. The gauntlet and dagger sent out sparks as they clashed and flew past each other. Baldr twisted his hand open at the strike and tried to scrape at Samson's face. Samson barely ducked under it and took a quick slash at Baldr's left ribs. Baldr pulled his arm back as quick as he could to get in between his ribs and the blade's edge. The blade sparked against the gauntlet once more as it passed, failing to make contact with Baldr. Baldr wanted to scream with pure joy. *I can stop it!* He thought. Now he had the momentum. Baldr began throwing more quick jabs and threw a few crosses in the mix. Samson had no choice but to parry each blow with his dagger, lest he take more severe damage. Sparks flew with each clash, and with every blow the speed picked up. Both fighters lost their ability to focus on the pain and poured every ounce of non-existent energy and attention into their blows. Samson's blade failed to cut into Baldr, but Baldr's fists could not reach Samson.

""Sparks are flying down here, everyone! Both fighters looked like dead men walking, but their fighting like it's the start of the match! How are they doing this!?"" Heimdall shouted.

""That would happen a lot back in the day."" Abdon said. ""He'd walk out onto the battlefield and fight until his body gave out.""

""How long could he go for?"" Shamgar asked.

""On a full belly and rest? Three whole days, non-stop. Now? He's running on empty. He'll be down before long if he can't kill that god soon.""

""What a beast.""

""Not at all. Just a man fighting for the people behind him.""

""Hmmm?""

""One of my biggest failures with him. I turned him into a weapon motivated by his desire for approval. I tried to teach him it's not about that, but the people back home who cannot fight. We're protectors, not weapons. There were many cowards within the army who'd rather give up and join the enemy, or just run away. Not Samson. When everyone would refuse to fight, he went alone…and won.""

""How confident are you that he'll win this?""

Abdon looked over to his predecessor. ""Without a doubt.""

""Have you ever seen Baldr that happy before, Thor?"" Týr asked. He could not bring himself to pull his gaze away from his brother.

Thor shook his head. ""…Me neither. Thor…are we…are we awful brothers?"" Thor looked at Týr, confused. ""He was never that happy when he was with us. Is that our fault?""

""No."" Týr sat in silence, hoping for an explanation. ""Stop worrying about him. He's down there fighting with everything he has."" Týr sighed and continued to look on. The event below continuing to fill him with regret.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

""Samson! We're in trouble!"" Hlökk shouted. Samson knew what she was referring to. The dagger was holding up far better than Samson anticipated, but the prolonged struggle began to take effect. Cracks began to show along the edge, and each new blow and parry made them grow. He was running out of time. He made his last ditch move. Baldr threw a quick jab aimed at Samson's chest, but Samson took the risk and caught Baldr's forearm in his left hand. The sleeve of the gauntlet reverberated and grinded against his palm. He squeezed a little tighter to hold onto Baldr, and raised his right hand far above his head. Baldr caught onto what he was doing. His left hand was already loaded to fire from the movement of his jab. He twisted his hips and back, firing his left hand straight at Samson's stepped into Baldr's frame, the punch glided off of the back of his arm and right delt, tearing away skin. He pulled Baldr's right away from his body, shifting Baldr off-balance and created an opening at Baldr's left clavicle. Samson dropped his hand and dagger down like a bolt of lightning. Enough force existed behind that cut to cleave anything in front of it in two.

Except Baldr's gauntlet. *I KNEW YOU'D TRY THAT AGAIN*! Baldr screamed in his head. Just before the moment his left arm would straighten out, Baldr snapped it back and placed it right in the path of Samson's dagger. The gauntlet and the dagger screamed as they made contact and more sparks flew out. Samson put all his strength into the strike, and Baldr placed all of his strength into his legs and back to keep himself upright. A loud crack popped out, and the blade of Samson's dagger shattered. His arm continued down; his own momentum got the better of him. Baldr saw him heading down. Twisting his left arm straight up, he followed behind Samson with a brutal hammer fist aimed straight at the back of Samson's head. ""I'll crush your skull to dust! *Crushing Hoof of Authulma!""* Baldr roared. The world went quiet…everyone in the crowd held their breath. Brunhilde, Göll, and Li watched in horror as they were about to be down another Einherjar and even further behind in Ragnarök. Despair loomed over humanity. Many in the crowd felt hope drain from their bodies. Abdon and Shamgar gasped in horror. Even the Philistines within the crowd were horrified by the site, including two women who would rather see Samson die were the situation different.

Samson could hear the whirring sound growing closer and closer. Time began to slow to a crawl around him. Memories flooded back in. *Guess this is what they call 'life flashing before your eyes,' or something.* Samson thought. *Ah, damn.* He continued. *I really wanted to win…*

Everything went black.

""Oi, Samson!"" Abdon called out.

A young Samson, barely above ten years old and wearing a brown robe, ran towards his teacher in a field.

""Yes, Sir!"" Samson yelled loudly.

""Ready to continue training?""

""Yes, Sir!"" The two would spar for hours on end when there was an opportunity. Samson proved too strong for almost anyone, including most of the adult soldiers, to fight and train with. Abdon was a rare exception, but even he knew before long Samson would out-match him.

*Why the hell am I remembering this now?* Samson thought. *God, I hated those days. Stupid old coot would fight me until I could barely stand.*

Hours flew by in the blink of an eye, and the two finished their training just before sunset. Abdon sat down in front of an exhausted Samson sprawled out on the ground. ""Now that's how you do it, boy!"" Abdon yelled smiling.

""Shut up, you old fart."" Samson said gasping for air.

""Total of seven hours, with breaks for eating. Probably your best yet.""

""Who fights for seven hours!?""

""We do."" Abdon said stone-faced. Samson was taken aback by the sudden change. ""I'm the Judge. One day you'll be the Judge. It's our mission to lead and fight for our people. In order to do that, we must train harder, fight longer, eat more, and sleep like there's no tomorrow. For many of us, there is no tomorrow.""

""You take this way too seriously, Abdon."" Samson said twiddling with his hair in his fingers.

""Probably do, but our people need us. Your parents, my family, everyone down there below us at camp. We have to be the example that our people compare themselves to, in the hopes they become as strong and determined as us.""

""Pfft, if that was the case then this war would be over already.""

""You may be right, but it isn't and so we carry forth. Until the day comes and you're ready to lead, we will continue your training. When that day comes…you'll still be training!"" Abdon said laughing.

*That day never came.* Samson thought. *You died in battle before you finished training me. And I became this.* In that darkness…that empty solitary darkness…Samson finally broke. ""Why the hell did you die, you damn old fart!? Why are all the good people dying, and I'm still here!?"" Sam screamed into the abyss. ""That damn annoying Doctor! That stupid happy-go-lucky Archer. So damn…so damn stupid…why did they die and I'm still here!?"" He received nothing but silence.

""*Answer me, damn it!""*

""If you wanted a damn answer, ask politely."" A familiar voice said behind him. Samson turned around to see a familiar face; Abdon. ""If being good meant you'd live forever and being bad meant instant death, why the hell have laws and such?"" Abdon asked. Samson stood in silence. ""That's not the real question you need to ask.""

""Of course it is! It's the same damn question that's sat there in the back of my head since you died!""

""So? Doesn't make it the real question.""

""Then what is?""

""It's two, actually. Do you deserve to live, and do you deserve the chance to seek joy?""

""What?""

""Not 'what,' you slack-jawed halfwit. The two I said. Just so you know, the answer is yes. Stop beating yourself up. Stop comparing yourself to me, and everyone else. You're not a damn weapon, you're a person. A dumb one at least, but a person. Just like those two, and just like me.""

""Easier said than done.""

""When has that ever stopped you?"" Samson could not find the words to say. He wanted to refute him, but Abdon knew him too well. ""It's not a village or a people anymore, Samson. It's our entire species. If that doesn't motivate you, that kid's life depends on you. Now get out of your own way for a bit and win this one.""

""Yes, Sir…""

""Besides, the dagger wasn't the Völund anyway, was it?""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Samson's focus returned. Shifting his left foot ever so slightly, Samson twisted his head out of the way of the hammer fist. Letting go of Baldr's right arm, Samson pulled his own left in tight and clenched his fist. He was too close to generate enough power to finish the match, but he knew it would be enough to give him space and pressure Baldr. Just before he countered, the air around the two became heavy. Samson's heart went into overdrive, beating faster and faster. His muscles grew under his skin and his bones hardened. Feeling the power swell through him, Samson fired a short, sharp left blow towards Baldr's ribs. Baldr got his arm in front of it just in time. It did little to stop the blow. Baldr felt the force surge through his body and out his back. His arm and ribs cracked under the force, the blow lifting him off his feet. He sailed through the air once more, but managed to get his feet under him before landing, stumbling lightly.

Baldr shook his arm. Nothing broken, but the sight in front of him sent chills down his spine. The air around Samson grew heavy, but his body seemed eerily light. His breathing slowed and calm, his eyes focused on Baldr. His wounds from before still bled, but Samson paid them no mind. *What…what the hell happened!?* Baldr thought. *I destroyed his dagger! I destroyed his Völund. How could his punch even hurt me!? How is this happening!?* A thought popped into Baldr's head. *He…never needed the dagger. Hlökk's not the dagger! What is she then!?*

Samson's hair rose and came undone, the golden band shining as it melded into his hair. Waves of hair flowed all around Samson's back. It was soft and moved like water. ""Hlökk, one more time please."" The golden strands hiding amongst his hair took control and weaved Samson's hair into ten long braids, one wrapped around the other nine. The golden strands weaved through his hair and reformed back into the hairpin holding it all in place.

""She was the *hairpin!*?"" Baldr screamed out loud. His eyes wide with panic and incredulity.

""Never said the dagger was the Völund, did I?"" Samson asked smiling. The outcome was nothing that Baldr expected. He put too much stock into the theory that Samson's weapon was the Völund. None of his attacks harmed him prior to Samson starting to use the dagger, but he failed to catch that a few stabs from the blade were used prior to the initial cut. He pondered it may have been a simple build-up of the effect to bypass his protection. The idea it was just a normal weapon never crossed his mind, and now the oversight forced him into the worst possible situation.

An even stronger Samson. One that possessed skill near Týr's level, wit that rivaled Baldr's, and now, based on the pressure and the last blow, might that rivaled Thor. Baldr could not possibly be happier. ""Finally…finally! The ultimate test is before me!"" Baldr planted his feet firmly down and threw himself back. Four towers activated, and the barrier appeared behind Baldr. Baldr's entire body reverberated, but his planted feet kept him in place. ""I'm coming for you, Samson! Get ready!"" Baldr clenched his fists tightly, forcing blood out of the cuffs. The skin of the gauntlets squealed faster and faster.

Samson said nothing. He did just as Baldr did; planting his firmly in the ground, he threw himself back. The other four towers formed a new barrier behind him and he began to reverberate as well. ""Sorry, but I'm not waiting for you!""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

""Göll."" Brunhilde said. ""Don't look away. Samson finally reached his full strength and has become the strongest form of the Blade of Certain Death's Vow. He and Hlökk are putting their lives on the line with this move.""

Göll tried to avoid her sister's awareness, but she caught on to Göll turning away from the fight. ""It's too much, Sis. Why are they going so far? They're both close to dying!""

""Göll."" Li said. ""Let your sister focus.""

""But-""Li placed a hand on her shoulder.

""The two warriors down there have reached the pinnacles of their strength, even in such poor state. They're fighting to not only win, but validate themselves. I ask you, respect their effort. Respect your sister, and watch the match until it ends."" Göll couldn't argue with him. He was softer than he was before. Maybe the fight resonated with him. She followed their lead and watched.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Both fighters waited. Neither wanted to act too early, act recklessly. The reverberations coursed through their bodies. Blood flowed from their wounds. It was then that it happened again. Their breathing synced, their bodies swelled and shrunk at the same pace. Both took one last deep breath. Both raised their feet and shot off. Two high-speed blurs shot towards the other. Their fists ready. The ground beneath them shook as they passed and loose gravel flew away. In spite of the velocity, both Samson and Baldr were able to keep track of the closing distance. The timing had to be perfect. Too short or too far, they would fail to deal the decisive blow.

Closer.

Closer.

Closer…

Both fighters reared their dominant hands back as their lead foots slammed into the ground. Both entered their ideal range. The last ounces of strength combined with the kinetic force generated from stomping their feet twisted their bodies with so much force, anyone watching knew that being in front of just one of them was a death sentence.

*""Twin Spiraling Horns of Authulma!""*

*""Peerless Blow of Certain Death!""*

Baldr's left cross, holding the dreams of a god who wished more than anything to be seen as a respected peer by his Brothers and held to their prestige, soared. Samson's right, holding the duty of a Judge, the trust of his newest friend, and the desire to protect his people, flew. Neither fist aimed for the other person. Rather, their fists flew towards the other. They knew that trying to aim for the other would leave them open to a counter. They must destroy the weapons of their respective foe. Their fists clashed. Their faces contorted by pure and raw fury. Knuckle to knuckle, Baldr's gauntlets drilled into Samson's clenched fist. He could feel his arm propelling forward, victory finally in his grasp. He couldn't feel any pain from the collision. He could see what was happening. Samson's fist…smashed through Baldr's hand. His bones and flesh gave way, the gauntlets tearing as Samson's attack pierced through his arm. Everything below the bicep was gone. Blood and flesh caked both fighters.

Baldr did not hesitate. A single opening appeared. Twisting his body back to the left, Baldr fired a sharp right uppercut straight for Samson's chin. Samson saw it in his peripherals, and made the same movement to his right, firing his left hook straight into Baldr's right. Samson's fist erupted through Baldr's arm, severing it at the elbow. Samson twisted back to the left, pulling his right arm in as he spun for his last blow. He saw something, but he couldn't stop. He threw his final blow… but slowed down, and gently tapped his open palm and fingers on Baldr's chest. ""I win."" Samson said softly, smiling.

""What?"" Baldr asked.

""After the second strike…you closed your eyes.""

""Huh…guess I did."" Baldr smiled.

""Sorry, but I don't feel like giving you the death you want. I've done enough.""

""Why...why are you doing this?""

""I got to set a good example. For my people, and my 'little sister.' Someone has to!"" Samson's smile grew wider. Samson didn't want it to show, but all the energy in Baldr's body was gone. The rune vanished, and the only thing keeping Baldr standing was Samson's hand holding him in place. ""Besides, you shouldn't waste your breath on me. Go use it on someone who matters.""

Baldr took one deep breath and stepped away from Samson. No barrier appeared. Baldr took it as a sign he was losing time. He knew where the people he valued most were. Barely able to hold himself up, he walked and trailed blood from his injuries.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Baldr sat in a white hospital room, reading. Next to him was an elaborate bed occupied by a tall brunette man missing an arm and heavily bandaged. Save for the turning of pages and the beeping of machines, the room was silent. Baldr sat there for hours, days even. He felt it was improper of him to leave after taking the effort to get his brother, near-death at the hands of the giants, off the battlefield and stable. He thought he had better things to do, but this was far more important.

It was at this time, Týr began to stir. ""Where…where am I?""

""Back in Asgard, resting after surgery.""

""What happened?""

""The giants got you and your forces. I managed to get in and save you, but by the time I arrived they already took your arm.""

Týr looked over to the stump where his right arm was. He plopped his head back on the pillow. ""Guess I screwed up again…""

""You did, but you're alive. Next time you'll do better.""

""What's the point if I can't be Thor?""

*Don't say that.* Baldr thought.

""Be Thor? What the hell are you on about?""

""I can win fights. I can beat anyone in a one-on-one, but I'm useless in war. That's all Odin cares about. My mother's no better.""

*Stop saying that.*

""Please don't tell me you rushed into battle like that to prove you're just as good as Thor?""

The room returned to silence. *He's not supposed to say these things.* Baldr thought. *He's better than this!*

""Quit wasting your time. You'll never be as good as Thor at that. He's power incarnate for Heaven's sake!""

""Then what's the damn point of all this!?"" Tears flowed from his eyes. ""If I can't be what is needed of me, then what's the point? I lost my damn arm on top of all this crap!""

""Your arm can be regrown.""

""That's not the problem. People will know. They'll always know…that I'm not Thor or you.""

Baldr did not plan on consoling his brother. One of the biggest sources of his frustration and inadequacy was reduced to a broken mess in front of him, but he was dejected at the site. And did Týr think he was less than both older brothers?

*Damn being the older brother.*

""Then do what I do. Wear it.""

""Wear it?""

""Our scars are reminders of our past. Whether we wear them with shame or humility is up to us and no one else. How many can say they were willing to do what you did?""

""So walk around without an arm for the rest of my life?"" Týr asked chuckling a bit.

""That, grow it back, or try something else. I heard Hephaestus can build artificial limbs like no other.""

""That…might not be a bad idea."" The two chuckled a little. ""Baldr, I need to know. Why did you save me?""

Baldr was taken aback. Did Týr really know how he felt? ""That's a stupid question.""

""Baldr, I know how you feel about Thor and me. I doubt you don't feel some sense of joy at my situation.""

Baldr sighed. Týr stared at him, fear and uncertainty in his gaze. ""Týr…I don't hate you... or Thor. I just…hate the mess we're stuck in. Were it not for the old man and his obsessions, I think life would be better and we'd all be a happier lot.""

""So you don't hate me?""

""You're annoying and a pest sometimes, but no. And I saved you because you're my younger brother. That's what big brothers do... and I'll always be there for you.""

""Well that's a rough memory."" Baldr said to himself. He continued to shuffle across the arena floor, Samson watching in the distance. Hlökk appeared by his side, watching. Baldr stopped just before the edge of the arena and stared straight up at his brothers in Set and Yama's box seats. He took a deep breath. ""Týr!"" Baldr yelled. ""Thor!"" Both looked down. ""I finally got me some scars! Pretty cool, right!?"" Baldr's body began to glow with green energy and cracks erupted from his wounds. ""I'm sorry I was such a crappy brother! I just wanted…you two to look at me with pride! That's all... I ever wanted!"" He fought back his tears as emotions slowly erupted from his chest. His eyes met theirs. It must have been the delirium brought on by his blood loss, but the two of them…were looking at him with so much pride it must've been overwhelming. Tears flowed from Týr's eyes. Thor's expression softened and a soft smile grew. ""Guys…that's not fair!"" Baldr yelled, smiling and tears trickling down from his dimming eyes. The cracks began to grow and encompass his body. ""You can't give a guy what he…wanted right at the end! Can't…enjoy it…for very long…"" Baldr's body shattered into green crystal. The wind caught the crystals and blew them away. Samson and Hlökk stood in silence as the arena on the human side erupted into cheers and cries.

""We did it!"" Brunhilde and Göll screamed as they hugged each other.

""Well done, Samson."" Abdon said, full of pride and joy. Shamgar laughed and patted his peer on the back as they celebrated.

""How does it feel?"" Hlökk asked.

""Surreal, to be honest."" Samson said.

""Well, you teamed up with me! Of course we'd win.""

""I never doubted you, Hlökk. You're pretty reliable, you know that?""

""More than some old dagger, right?"" Hlökk said smiling and blushing.

""Hundred times more. Shall we get some tea?""

Hlökk jumped up and began floating. ""Not a bad idea…but I'll make the first pot. You still have to improve."" Samson laughed and followed her back to the arena entrance. He knew Hlökk was trying to give him a break, but would never admit it.

""Ladies and Gentlemen, Round 3 has come to an end! Blow for blow, cut for cut, neither fighter relented until the very end! Humanity is now on the board!

i used to love my life and i used to love myself. my life was full of joy, and love, and colour. the true definition of happiness. i was surrounded by people who would love me unconditionally. i felt warm with cuddles and i beamed with confidence. i cared about every single person on the planet and had endless love to share, and people had faith in me. they trusted me, i trusted them. i had real potential, so many paths to get lost down and so far to go. i didn’t know what it felt like to be alone, because i was never alone. i always had my beautiful mummy, who supported me with every decision i made. and i always knew if nobody else stood by me she’d be there by my side. me and my mummy against the whole wide world, until the end. even if i complained about having to make her morning coffees, “woffkins” she called them, she’d still do anything for me. without a second thought she sacrificed herself for anything my heart desired. she had so much strength and carried both of us on her own, with her bad back. she hurt so i didn’t have to ever feel pain. she starved so i could eat.

i abandoned her. i wrecked her house, because i thought that was what it meant to be alive. i saw the smaller portions on the plate and i still stole her food. i saw the little money in her bank and i still took every penny. i forced her to watch while i destroyed myself, my body, and dug myself a deeper hole full of hatred and lies. then sunk my teeth in as hard as i could, clung onto her, thoughtlessly sucked all of the love, warmth, energy and colour out of her body and out of perfect selfishness dragged her down with me. i admit i broke my mother. i drove her into a hole down to insanity and failure and she trusted me with her life, even if i didn’t know the first thing about cars. she believed i loved her as much as she did, why would she have her seatbelt on?

now my life is, and will always be, dark and gloomy and grey. monotonous and unfortunate, unworthy and forgettable. i’m completely alone. nobody truly loves me. nobody even appreciates my conversation or takes the time to even listen. nobody will ever love me like my mother did. i’m long lost, gone. i’m the remains, the black corpse of a beautiful, innocent, colourful girl buried far, far underneath the ground. i’m nothing but a white ghost who stands in plain sight amongst the varying gradient of people who still bother to cling to their souls, but my desperate redemption is a thing of the past. i cannot restart, i cannot live remembering but i cannot forget. i’m utterly miserable and i’m stuck missing you, my other half. i know i made a reckless mistake, foolishly thinking i needed my independence, but i can’t live like this on my own anymore. i live in a sick childhood fairytale where i purposefully pretend to hate you out of spite, but it’s my own guilt and shame. it wasn’t until i was tied to a fable prison of my own making and i have no choice but to live with soul eaters, that i deeply feel this empathy for you, after i tore and devoured chunks out of you. the irony of how the tables have turned. 

i still long everyday for the heat of your boundless and forever powerful compassion to comfort my cold and heartless corpse, plagued with apathy. you just wanted to know i loved you, but i didn’t tell you because i thought it would be the vulnerability that would kill me. but it’s the absence of you.

you brought the zest of life to me. and in return i dirty and poison your name with my filthy, infectious tongue. i turned your soft and delicate skin black and blue. i stole your potential at life with my very birth and existence, but you always thought i was your tiny miracle. i callously ruined everything you worked hard to get, your job, later your chances at one, your degree, your reputation, your brand new house, a home i could never afford. you briefly saw a door open, your potential to restart without me, and i killed this unborn child out of jealousy. i smashed my new iphone 4s on the ground that you saved and starved for, in front of your very eyes. i always expected more from you after you gave me everything you had.

mum, i love you. but you made me want to die.

So after finishing my lab work I was walking towards metro station and one guy stopped me and he was from Bangalore and he asked me for near by coffee shop and I was suggesting him few names , then he asked me where do I visit , I said him i rarely visit any cafes so I have no idea about it later he asked me for Instagram ID out of nowhere so I am a kind of person who just hesitate to say ""No"" directly, I didn't gave my Insta ID instead I asked his insta ID ( best I could do at that moment) .
So now the thing is my boyfriend ( now ex) 
Thinks that I was entertaining that guy ,
I told him that all my life I stayed in nagpur I have no idea about his intentions like if they are asking coffee location and all. I said him that I was just helping poor guy . Also it was nearby IT park so there are usually lot of people around me hence I stopped and helped him if it happens in any isolated place I would have not helped him so I was safe .
I know he is been protective , and worried about me but is it okay to say that I entertain guys???

Just wanted to give this group some real-time opinions and reviews on some places I ate at so far, and some other activities I did so here goes, I will try to do another 1 or 2 of these as I get closer to leaving. I am staying in an air bnb in the 17eme. Close to Ave de Clichy. Some of this stuff is scattered throughout Paris though

1982 Bistro Romain - restaurant - had the charcuterie plate and the chicken parm and some red wine. The mortadella was hands down the best mortadella I have ever had in my life, that is almost 50 years of eating this stuff as I am an Italian American raised in an ""off the boat"" Italian household. The overall price for all above was 19 euros, hell of a deal. I could eat that mortadella every day. Get the daily formule the prices are great

Octopussy - bar - cool place, excellent house red wine, cool bartender, great prices

Les Deux Coupoles - brasserie - been here a few times so far, love this place. Best house red wine I have had yet. Also had a duck confit casserole over white beans here and that was fantastic.

L'Industrie - brasserie - right next to Deux Coupoles - this is usually my morning coffee place - bartender is cool - also had a delicious burger here that had a perfect runny egg on it. That was great, the house red was great, the breakfast wasn't great but everything else was.  

Le Palais 17 - restaurant - this place had amazing reviews online, but when I got there I wasn't impressed at all. Service was terrible and there was only 2-3 people in the whole place - I paid for my drink and left and went to Deux Coupoles lol.  Maybe you will have better luck

Jincheli Thai - thai restaurant - Had the papaya salad, also the beef green curry with sticky rice. Formule was a great price and overall the food was very good.

Blue Monkey - thai food - again, I went with the formule - dumplings, seafood in coconut milk and rice, a couple of yuzu moscow mules, and a matcha creme brulee.  Those mules and that brulee were amazing. I have never had matcha brulee, it's rare at almost 50 yrs old that you eat something so new, but that was great.

Cafe Pimpin - coffee shop - meh, not impressed, again great reviews, but maybe they were having an off day. 

Arbane - cocktail bar near the Seine River, I found this place while just wandering in Paris waiting for my cruise to start, excellent craft cocktails, and decently priced for what you get. If you enjoy a well made whiskey old fashioned, this place is worth stopping at. The 2 bartenders are master craftsmen.

Le Calife - dinner cruise - there are so many of these to do and this is the one I picked, I am glad I did. From the mini croissants and espresso martini to the duck leg, everything was great. Foie gras, wine, apple tart dessert. For what you get and what you pay, I thought it was more than fair, service excellent also. The architecture along the Seine is spectacular.

""Cook'n with class"" french cooking lesson -  There are a few different courses to take, I chose the market trip where we go with Chef Fabrice to buy stuff at the market by Place Jules Joffrin, and then we go cook that stuff into a 3-4 course meal. Overall excellent experience. Chef Fabrice is a walking history book and by the time it came to the cheese plate I was learning stuff I never thought I would. Worth every penny, may go back to do the croissant and/or baking course. 

Club Pierre Charron - Poker room and casino - I am a regular poker player, this place is one of the nicest rooms I have ever been to. There is a cigar room, a restaurant, assorted table games, and a poker room. I only play poker not regular casino games, so I cannot comment on those, but the poker room is nice. The food here is beyond good. So far I have had the foie gras (the mango chutney is great), the agnolotti w/truffle cream sauce, and the brioche caramel french toast dessert. Everything is delicious, and it is nice to have that great restaurant there to eat while waiting for your table because it can be a wait sometimes.  That agnolotti was one of the best things I have ever eaten in my entire life. I would argue it is worth stopping here to eat even if you do not gamble lol......seriously. The chef is amazing.

I’ve had a roommate for about five years now. She used to stay with me and my mom, and when me and my then boyfriend (now husband) moved out, she came with us. We’ve been living here for almost a year. 
My roommate, for lack of a better word, is cheap. She doesn’t really buy too much stuff because she lives with little which is OK, I don’t care never had, as long as the rent is paid we are all good. She does have over 5k in her savings (which I know because she always talks about it lol). She doesn’t cook, so she doesn’t use the kitchen, and I have told her plenty of times this is our house you can use the kitchen, and use the cupboards and stuff but she always declined, so all of the stuff there is mine. 
 We make coffee every morning in the coffee maker we bought. A few months ago we told her if she wanted coffee she could grab some because sometimes we have leftover coffee, so you know that’s ok. I started noticing that my cups were disappearing, and I started seeing her with them. We bought a set with plates and stuff that came with black cups. I also brought a couple from my moms place which is a set of two big cups black and white. 
She was using the white cup to drink everything, soup, coffee, and NEVER WASHED IT, so I didn’t say anything because it was disgusting anyway, so I didn’t want it back. Yesterday as I was talking to her she had one of my black cups, grabbing my coffee, using sugar and creamer and NEVER buying any, and not even asking me for it.

Stats:
F Age: 30s SW: 202, CW: 189, GW: 150

Background:
I hovered between 140-160 for most of my adult life. High stress of having kids back to back (3 of them in 5 years), working, fasting and breastfeeding kept my weight low. When my youngest started school and I started an office job, my body went into rest mode and I gained a significant amount of weight within that first year. It's been really hard to get it off. My motivation was low and I felt like no matter what I tried, I never saw scale movement. I started to have health problems that I now realize we're directly related to the weight gain and I finally decided enough was enough. After realizing my normal 16:8 fasting schedule was no longer working for me, I decided to try omad. 

Month 1: 
Adjusting to the omad schedule was not as difficult as I thought it would be. I have fasted between 16:8 and 20:4 off and on for years so it was really just sticking to it. I was super hangry the first week, but it tapered off. The most difficult part for me was coffee. I usually drink coffee all day starting with a sweet latte as soon as I wake up. I chose not to drink black coffee in the mornings and instead make hot loose leaf green or oolong tea. I used to be coffee CRAZY, now I have a hard time drinking a full cup of coffee in my eating window. Side note, my daily headaches have reduced significantly! After years of suffering, it's so weird to not have headaches everyday.

At this point I do not count calories. When I would first break my fast, I would binge like crazy, now I just eat a normal dinner (I cook all meals) and have a coffee and small dessert (1-2 pieces of leftover halloween candy). I have a feeling I'll eventually have to track calories, but for now I'm going to go with intuitive eating. 

Exercise: None yet. My motivation for anything was absolute zero before starting this. Now, I actuality find myself wanting to be more active. I'll probably start yoga again.

Changes:
No crazy changes yet other than being less bloated. My face has slimmed, but only to me. No one has made any comments. Clothes fit better, but no size changes. I overall just feel better.

Thanks for reading, see you next month!

1gpn7so,https://www.reddit.com/r/LanceHedrick/comments/1gpn7so/pressure_controlled_espresso_for_1000/,Pressure Controlled Espresso for $1000?,"Howdy y'all! I recently sold my semi-auto espresso machine and I'm looking to really ramp the quality of the espresso I make. After experimenting with lever machines a bit, I realized how powerful pressure control can be as I was able to quickly find a clarity I never had in the long time I'd owned the semi-auto. I'd love a lever machine, but almost all of them seem to have large issues with temperature, and I don't want to spend much time in my workflow flushing to preheat chambers or temperature surfing.

Some contenders, though I'm not tied to just these:

1. Gaggia Classic Pro + Gagguino (\~$750): this seems like a very strong option. Not too much fussing day-to-day. My only concerns are that it will be too difficult to set up or I'll get boiler issues and my warranty will be voided.
2. Flair 58+ 2 ($685): seems like a pretty good choice as well. I really enjoy the manual lever action. I played around with one of the other Flair models and clean-up was frustrating compared to a semi-auto machine. No steaming milk either but the heated brew chamber is really nice so I don't have to pre-heat.
3. La Pavoni Professional Lusso ($850): beautiful machine, and having the steam wand would be great. I worry about the temperature fluctuations with this machine though. If anyone has a Pavoni and makes great coffee easily and consistently I'd be happy to hear more.
   1. Would also consider a cheaper or second-hand La Pavoni model if there are mods that help with temp stability. 

Anyways — these are just some I found during my research. I'm not tied to them and there is some more room in my budget to play with. Open to any and all suggestions.

He has a mutation of Inko's quirk in that he can basically slingshot items by having them orbit him briefly before being fired off in any direction but he has a similar weight limit to his mum. Inko was killed by a villain when he was a kid and Nemuri was the first hero on the scene after Inko died. She actually arrives right as Inko gets stabbed and Izuku awakens his quirk which he uses to slingshot a small piece of rubble at the villain. Years later Izuku gets into the entry exams where he meets Ochako. The two are really scary together in combat as ochako removes the weight limit Izuku had on his quirk, this allows him to go from firing small bits of rubble to hurling cars at things (like say the 0 pointer trying to crush them) when needed. 

They both get into 1A and there was a celebratory dinner set up by nemuri for this. Day 1 of class sees Izuku and Ochako both achieve infinity on the ball throw as while ochako just floated the ball, Izuku was able to wind it upto excape velocity before letting it loose.

Is there hope and What should I do?","It all started when we met in college last year. We were working on the same project, exchanged phone numbers, got along pretty well, and started texting every so often. I didn’t ask her, but she mentioned she had a boyfriend, and I didn’t say anything about having feelings for her (which I do) and carried on with the rest of the school year.

One year later, on a random night, I hadn’t thought about this girl since college, but all of a sudden, she came to mind, and I thought, 'I wonder what she’s up to.' The next day, she followed me on Instagram! I was so surprised—I’d just thought about her, and then she followed me. I followed her back, and we started talking, reconnecting easily.

After a few days, she came out and asked, ""Do you like me?"" I replied, ""Yes, I do like you…"" She told me she had broken up with her boyfriend a month ago, and I was thrilled. She also explained that the reason she’d been distant with me before was that she had been catching feelings and didn’t want to ruin her relationship, which I totally understood. Our conversations quickly grew flirtier, with her adding extra letters to words like 'Awwww' and 'Totallyyyyy.'

I started thinking about taking her on casual dates—maybe to a movie or a restaurant. She even invited me to be her plus-one at a friend’s wedding. We hadn’t seen each other in person for a while, so she invited me to stop by her work for a coffee. Before going, I bought her a bag of her favorite candy, decorated with our favorite football teams. When I arrived, I was nervous but excited. She smiled as soon as I walked in, gave me a hug, and loved the candy gift. We chatted during her break, and I noticed she was playing with her hair, which can be a sign of nervousness. As her break ended, she walked me to my car, and we shared two long hugs before I left.

Before we met up, she’d told me that her parents are strict and that she wanted to focus on herself before dating again, which I respected. The next day, I texted her to say thanks again for last night and that I hoped she enjoyed her candy. She replied, ""You’re welcome, and thank you for the candy."" I asked about her day, and she said it went well. Then she texted me this:

""I also spoke with my parents right now and told them about you and I just you know hanging out but my parents don’t think it’s good for me right now to be talking with someone cause they ya know assume and were right I have some feelings for you but they think it’s too soon because of the break up and honestly they might be right (my name), you’re the sweetest and super caring trust me when I say that but I know my parents at the end of the day want what’s best for me, and plz don’t hate me but they’re making my brother go with me to the wedding since he’s already gonna be in town, I’m so so sorry I promise its nothing against you, I just know that they’re right maybe it’s best if I do just focus on myself right now and I would have told you this in person but they just told me right now and I wouldn’t want to wait to do that, that’s not right, if you ever want a free coffee though lol you’re more than happy to visit me or come to me with any advice I just need to figure out some things right now I’m sorry.""

I replied, ""Thank you for being honest with me, I could never hate you, I totally understand where your parents are coming from, and I respect your decision to focus on yourself right now, just know that I care about you and I’m here if you ever want to talk or hang out, even if it’s just for coffee, take your time to figure things out, and I’ll be here when you’re ready.""

This has lead to a depression.

Through this, myself and my partner would always be there to assist her and try to keep her on her feet in any ways we could. That said we live hours away, both work full time and have our own responsibilities so sometimes this can be difficult.  

I've noticed a bit of a trend though, which dates back even before her current predicament. She would have something she would like to achieve, lets say, cooking more meals for herself. However, she would say that she will start doing this once a secondary goal was achieved first. Such as the mould in the kitchen being fixed. 

The secondary goal would always be a logical one, and something that would be done. 

However, when this secondary goal would be achieved, a new one would appear that would replace it. Therefore she would never start cooking more meals for herself. 

Another example was when we suggested that she visits a local beach semi-frequently with a coffee and a podcast or book, just to elevate her mood maybe once a twice a month. She loves the beach and she loves listening to a podcast etc. She adored the idea and said it would be something she would do when she got her new car. 

Again, this secondary goal made sense as she couldnt rely on her current vehicle. However, she got the car, but she never started visiting the beach. 

I can equate it to when people say they'll start their diet on Monday, but that Monday always becomes the one the following week and so on.



She always gets a boost when we visit her or she visits us, and leaves with a lot more excitement and motivation to do these things but it very quickly falters when shes gone. Again, as mentioned at the start we sadly cannot be there more to uplift her!

How can we go about approaching this and helping her overcome it? We dont want to bring it directly on her as it will obviously get her on the defensive. But are there any ways we could lead her to tackle this mentality without being too overt about it?

We've tried encouraging her to make some friends in her local area or getting out and about more, but not only does she value her own space and time she also gets exhausted very easily and some days are complete write offs due to her health conditions. So I think it needs to be a way to change her mentality or the way she thinks about tasks, rather than changing external factors such as socialising etc. (as again, those would be more movable goals)

I'm not big into milk drinks, so a steam wand isn't strictly necessary, though it's fun to use occasionally. Does anyone have recommendations for machines under $1,000 USD that will help me push the quality of my espresso and get that ""god shot""? I enjoy light and medium roasted coffee.

Some contenders, though I'm not tied to just these:

1. Gaggia Classic Pro + Gagguino (\~$750): this seems like a very strong option. Not too much fussing day-to-day. My only concerns are that it will be too difficult to set up or I'll get boiler issues and my warranty will be voided.
2. Flair 58+ 2 ($685): seems like a pretty good choice as well. I really enjoy the manual lever action. I played around with one of the other Flair models and clean-up was frustrating compared to a semi-auto machine. No steaming milk either but the heated brew chamber is really nice so I don't have to pre-heat.
3. La Pavoni Professional Lusso ($850): beautiful machine, and having the steam wand would be great. I worry about the temperature fluctuations with this machine though. If anyone has a Pavoni and makes great coffee easily and consistently I'd be happy to hear more.

Anyways — these are just some I found during my research. I'm not tied to them and there is some more room in my budget to play with. Open to any and all suggestions.

*\*Examples: Punkt 1, Nokia (225 4G 2020, 235 4G 2024)*

**Various points between 2020-2022** \- Nothing to write home about. I was working in retail and fairly bored in life. I didn’t have any grandeur purpose - just got an idea to do it. I would last a month at most each time. 

**Late 2022/Early 2023 (7 months)** \- This time it had full purpose. I was in my final year of college (a repeat year) and I had to pass. As I already struggled with focusing, I knew something had to change. Getting rid of (and selling) my smartphone proved to be a really good idea - and I passed. It gave me the space to be creative and to apply myself to studying. I did miss out on a group snapchat for the people in the class but I don’t think there was that much value in it. 

**September 2023** \- I decided to buy a F22 Pro - basically a nokia with android. Perfect I thought - I can have WhatsApp and my banking apps while not being distracted! I had a bad experience with this as the only practical way to type is with a gboard on a phone with a T9 keyboard and 3 inch display - disaster. I used this for about a week before I cracked. The thing bricked when I factory reset it with intent to sell. Bye Bye F22 Pro.

**2024** \- Recently with switching back to my Nokia 225 4G (2020 model) it has manifested differently. In the past year a lot has happened, that being tragedy and change. My smartphone addiction has skyrocketed and I was using it to cope. Like any drug, it had started losing its full effect and with that I started to feel like I needed to face the music. Returning back to the Nokia was really hard this time because I wasn’t only sitting with myself - I was sitting with the heaviness of the year. This was the best choice, and it felt healthy for my brain. The same way your body feels lighter and better when you eat well - my thoughts and process felt more fresh and inspired. It brought me peace after the initial storm. I think due to this I realise it’s time to completely break up with my smartphone and say goodbye. My goal is to not touch my IPhone until January (except for a couple of days I’ll be abroad where I’ll need maps for navigating). 

Losing my smartphone gave me back the space and time I needed to think about necessary thoughts. It’s not something that might happen naturally. Instinctively you may go from one distraction to another, but in order to feel the beauty of space, you need to let it breathe, and you need to sit with it. I’d recommend sitting in a coffee shop within the first week of getting a dumbphone, and sit there, maybe write, and just sit with your thoughts. Get comfortable with that brain you’ve been feeding with nothing for so long. I’d recommend drafting up a couple lists of your favorite things/chores to do, and pin it up somewhere on the wall or fridge as a reminder of what you could be doing instead of scrolling your 70-90 years away.

Some context: we have been in a relationship for about 6 years, she is working ( and finishing college) I, after some post covid problems, which took a lot of my time, am finishing my degree (medicine).We both live with our parents, since we cannot afford an apartment.I don't work (because of classes and internships).

About 2 years ago our sex life slowly disappeared, at the moment it's a year and 3 months that we don't have an intimate relationship. And this has created a lot of tension. I tried to ask many times what the problems were and try to solve them together. Her answer was always “I don't know.” Finally, after some pressure, she was able to tell me what the problem is: she thinks I am a child for still living with my parents, still being in college and not having my own independence. And all this makes her not feel physically attracted to me.

Now the problem: for about 3 months she has been in regular contact with a colleague at work, and when I say regular I mean every day, are we on vacation? They write each other, we are on the bed relaxing? They write to each other.

I don't know when exactly he asked her out for a hike in the mountains. Her response was “ given the precarious situation with my boyfriend, it doesn't seem appropriate, however, it's okay to have coffee.” So they will meet for coffee.

Thoughts?

I really need some male advice here, basically I was seeing a guy and it was going really well and we got on amazingly. On our last date he told me how much he liked me and how much he thought of me (which I thought was great bc I wanted to see more of him and we’d planned a few weekends in advance to stay over with each other). Towards the end of the date things got a bit weird and his behaviour changed very suddenly, he was getting in peoples faces - not aggressively but they did not appreciate it at all and I was basically pulling him away and telling him to just calm down a little bit as these people did not enjoy that behaviour. He then told me that I was ‘exactly’ what he needed in a partner because I did that. We then went to my friends place and had a really nice evening all together and him and my friend got on really well which I was really happy about. 

The following Monday he then text me to say things wouldn’t work between us. Obviously I was a little upset and offered to talk his concerns over - he wouldn’t budge at all on it and didn’t speak to me. I sent a text basically saying I would still like to see each other and i was sorry about anything I may have said/anyway I may have made him feel. Still no response so I left things at that.

Two weeks later he started liking my stories on Instagram, and had been watching my stories constantly. I then mulled things over as I was unsure if I should engage but eventually sent a message asking if he’d like to get coffee and he said yes but then stopped replying again. I left things alone, then he started sending me reels on Instagram, so we had a bit of a back and forth doing that. I then asked if he wanted to get a drink and again said yes, then the day comes round and he just doesn’t reply. I sent another text saying that I was still interested but I was getting mixed signals from him and was unsure what his intentions were and of course he he’s read it and not replied.

I’m very confused by the whole situation, he engages with me and in my opinion tries to get my attention by liking my stories, sending me reels etc but then backs off again. It’s been playing on my mind a lot because I read into things a great deal (unfortunately part of being a woman), and obviously I really liked this guy but his behaviour is just weird. I’d much rather he just told me to F off, but it’s the constant dipping in and out which makes me think he’s just doing this to mess with my head.

1gpmu9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gpmu9v/the_art_of_saving_i_learnt/,The art of saving I learnt.. ,"I won't call myself a spendthrift but someone who wouldn't think twice before spending. Being the eldest I always knew that it's my responsibility to look after everyone and happily did. I earn fairly well and usually freelance. I take up projects only if it's worth it. I honestly never saved money and never thought of it till I got married. Being from a North Indian family ( Typical Old school family where ghar ki beti becomes paraya dhan - got activated immediately after my wedding. My house henceforth was not mine anymore and my spouse family always gave me a feeling that the house I entered is not mine either.) I got all my siblings married before settling down and everyone were settled but my definition of settlement changed.

In October 2022, I decided for the first time to have savings, all proposed their suggestions. But in my head I started with my little plan- Ek toh Bhagwan Bharose paise( save cash in hand for emergency, when all options close this money comes in hand). Second have 3 fd of different denomination - one of 5 lakh which would be for something big, one of 2 lakhs for emergency for my parents and one of 1.5 lakh if my friends or siblings needed. 

I was hearing alot of mutual fund but had no clue so my brother opened an account in Kuvera and asked me to invest in nifty 50. He asked me how much i want to invest, I said 500. He opened an sip of 500 but I didn't know what it was. In December 2022, I took the task of understanding what is mutual fund, and tried understanding equity, debt, hybrid, thematic etc. Then I choose to increase the sip and also choose different funds which I thought made sense to me and choose to put only that amount which I would have spent on coffee, meeting friends etc. like waise bhi kharach hone the type. Mentally all my extravagance money was invested in mutual fund and simultaneously my fd was made( priority- no risk amount). Unlike what I was advised not to track everyday, I would log in around 11:30pm to see what happened and why and what caused it. I went berserk with funds and was honestly expecting nothing in return except learning and growing. I learnt about money market fund, liquid fund etc and even modified my sip amount if I knew there will be less money for any particular month. But choose not to stop unless I wanted to stop. I got a return of 1.75 lakh for amount 3.80 which ofcourse since June went down and has reached 1 lakh now( Aaj raat aur niche jayega). But no complains. I knew I am investing to have a secure future for myself, my family and instead of spending money on coffee and unnecessary expenses I rather save. 

This year in June I even tried to invest directly in stocks, my strategy was simple. I choose maharatna and navratna company like Gail, engineer's India, sail, etc and also got few shares of IRB, hcc, Wipro. Since June till today I have invested around 1 lakh 9 thousand and having a loss of around 4800 which again didn't affect me because I also saw the graph grow in between.

Long story short, I have no knowledge about stocks or anything but I know that if one is investing in it, then risk only that amount which won't affect your peace of mind. When you invest just remember the good day biscuit we had once in our childhood used to come in a huge box for less price but today 6 biscuits are packed for more money. Eventually all stocks from good reliable company will grow provided we give time. 

It's investing not gamble. Oh yes, I even took gold ETF and though digital gold is not considered good, I started that so that I can always use it if ever I need to gift to my niece or anyone on their big occasion.

Our friend routinely about once every other month comes to stay with us. Often without asking until hours before he gets here even though he will tell us he is coming into town weeks prior. We drive him around, cook dinner for him, buy coffee donuts etc when we pop in somewhere. He always asks to stay the weekend and the last time was at our house for ten days. This time he asked to stay the weekend and it’s now Tuesday and he seems to have no plans to leave. He never once says thank you for a meal, ice cream, coffee… NOTHING! It drives me nuts!!! My boyfriend says I have to let it go that’s just who is and I can’t seem to let it go. I grow more and more resentful with every meal I spend hours cooking not for just him but myself and my partner but I do have to adjust the amount as he eats a lot. We will go to grocery store together and not offer to get anything but will buy junk food and snacks. Every time he leaves and just says see ya next time it boils my blood. We haven’t made it out to visit him so it’s never been reciprocated which is not his fault. We live in a one bedroom 765ft apartment so it’s very tiny and cramped as is and even more so with an additional person and their things all over which adds to my stress. 
How do I go about bringing this up to him at this point it’s been going on for three years. My partner it very easy going and notices it as well but is less bothered by it. AITAH? Do I need to chill or say something? 

Edit- he lives with a parent has never lived alone. He also doesn’t work but receives disability and has no bills doesn’t buy his own food etc. he has only one hand so tasks live cleaning the dishes etc would be a challenge but we do have a dishwasher he could contribute by loading. He also drives here so he has a car but never offers to drive after he arrives. Not once have we even been in his car ",1,1731424123.0,AskWomenOver30,5,0.6,False
1gpmtjc,https://i.redd.it/v8nt2j5skh0e1.jpeg,Lurked for a while . . . ,"First post ever. Checking in here has been so helpful  before and since I started. It is pretty neat how many people you have probably helped but may never know it. So maybe I can help pay it forward for future lurkers and beginners by adding to the supportive community here. I just took my 13th shot (4x 2.5, 8x 5, 1x 7.5). My weight has always been hard for me. At age 5, I remember seeing my legs in shorts on the backseat of my parents’ car and asking my mom if there was a way to cut into my skin to put a vacuum inside to suck out the fat . . .  and at 7 doing an “about me” project in the school and listing my weight (74#) and getting teased . . . being called “Roseanne Barr” at age 10 . . . etc. I thinned out a little as I got older, but was always “the fat one” in my friend groups and was told as much by the outside world. 

There was a brief period at 17 when I was at a healthy weight due to a work schedule, and again in my 20s because I started jogging (got down to about 165#). But the weight just slammed back on after the initial dip, despite an active lifestyle (several half-marathons, more 5Ks than I can count) and very healthy eating. It was maddening. I cried to my partner. I cried to my friends. They all said they could not comprehend how I was not thin as a rail because of my running routine (30 miles per week) and light eating. I cried to doctors. My PCP just said I must be lying about my activity and what I ate. I EVENTUALLY left that doc. 

Another finally dx me with PCOS (250#). They were kind and sympathetic but did not have a great solution other than encouragement to stay active and then prescribed metformin; I lost 8#. Then started regaining. I stopped weighing myself after I gained 20# in 18 days. Stopped metformin too because it seemed like there was no point and I stopped going to the doctor for a few years because it felt futile. Gaining so many # finally made jogging too painful so I transitioned to walking for the past 2 years.  With the launch of GLPs, I have been sooooooo curious. I finally went back to my kind PCP this spring. I was horrified to learn I was almost 280#. I was shocked because overeating has NOT been my issue, so it has just never made sense to gain so quickly and so much so easily. I’m tall and apparently “carried it well” so it was not super noticeable other than my clothes getting tighter all the time. My PCP said I would be a good candidate for GLPs based on my PCOS and IR. Re-started metformin in June. Lost 9#. Then we integrated Zep 13 weeks ago. I have lost an additional 25# so far in those 13 weeks. No side effects - I feel great! In fact, I went from having awful GI issues to a normal schedule. Hardly changed anything, other than adding a little time to my daily walks and doing my coffee mixed with the Fairlife protein shake (the one with 170 cals and 26g of protein) rather than JUST coffee. My doc was so happy FOR me and WITH me. Said that the loss was proof that I was doing the right stuff, but my PCOS and IR was keeping me from success.  

I just recently re-started jogging. I don’t see a huge difference yet, but I know my clothes fit better and I feel lighter and more energized. 

I was scrolling photos and saw the pic from the spring, then took the one from the fall the other day. I acknowledge there is some difference in my neck/chin. I still have a long way to go, but for the first time in a long time I feel hopeful. This is life-changing medication for me and for so many. I pay the $550 out of pocket with the savings card because my coverage will not authorize it for me (so frustrating). But it’s worth it. I’m using the outdoors instead of a gym to save money (weights at home), and don’t have an expensive haircare/salon routine. I feel like this monthly expense is worth the long term ROI. 

Just hope this can be encouraging to anyone who was like me and has been lurking for some assurance or comfort before they begin. It has been one of my best decisions ever and you guys helped me make it. ❤️

About a month ago, I was told I had a 30% PVC burden by my cardiologist and while I kinda knew it was gonna be high, I didn't think it was that high. I'm having a follow up with my cardio today and he's gonna discuss the results of my echo, treadmill test, and Holter monitor so we'll see what he suggests for the next step, I am really nervous though.

For those who had high burdens, what did your cardiologist suggest as the next step?

I'm guessing he's gonna tell me I need to get an ablation done, which will suck, or maybe prescribe me some medications like a beta blocker or calcium blocker, which will be better but still suck, but idk. The thing I hate the most about this, besides having a bad heart rhythm, is not being able to drink coffee or caffineated tea anymore. I've been caffeine free for about a month since he told me to stop drinking it and it's just sucked since I used to drink Cuban espressos every day before.

So she dropped by for a coffee today as scheduled. Normal catch up was ok… then she says she’s an ambassador for this medical company that does ‘brain training’. She says they’ll first do an audit/analysis of some kind then give you tailored exercises. I said “how much”, she said it depends. First alarm bell starts ringing.

She said she needed my help getting people into the company presentation where they would receive the analysis for free and there was no pressure to actually pay for the full suite of offerings. I said it sounded like a time share presentation, she genuinely didn’t know what that was and I tried breaking it down for her. 

She then did this memory test exercise. She asked me to make up 10 random 2-digit numbers and then set her timer for how long it would take her to memorise it. It took her 44 seconds and then to be fair, she did recall each of the numbers accurately which seemed impressive. She said that was from the programme.

As a teenager they will learn something new like an instrument and dedicate songs or entire paintings emphasizing what they find interesting about you. 

As adults they will selflessly provide for you, working hard jobs all day to provide for you and your children to make sure they have the best life they can live. 

And then finally old age, when your body doesn't move as agile or as graceful as it used to, your physical appearance changes so greatly from when you were so full of life. 

And still that same Human you married will whistle like a cat-caller at you, hold your hand, kiss it softly, and ask if you want to enjoy a nice cup of coffee or tea and just talk. 

On both your deathbeds, that Human will always pray to whatever god created them that they pass on second, so that your last moments are them holding your hand with a loving tear in their eyes.

If you are lucky, and I hope that extends to any species reading this, May you find love, and if you love a Human, may you be reward one who will love you, at all stages of your lives together.

It’s fantastic to have so many sports events and shows within walking distance.

I have a passion for cooking, although my schedule doesn’t always allow for it. I own all of Ina Garten’s cookbooks, and right now, I’m getting ready to make Pioneer Woman’s Veggie Ragu with Cheesy Polenta. I’m excited to see how it turns out!

We thought it was sleep apnea, but it happened every night even when I wear my mask (yes I have tried every pressure and mask in the book). I have been diagnosed with it. Mask comes off every night in about an hour due to a wake up or a night terror. It is usually 50/50. 

I don't have any known trauma in my childhood that would lead to this, I had a very loving family and no traumatic events. I am currently seeing a psychologist for this just to be sure, but we have found no results as of yet.

I’m currently going through a divorce. My husband asked for it earlier this year after we struggled through several difficult life events together (miscarriages). While I was trying to process everything, I met a guy we’ll call “M” on a trip. I wasn’t looking for anything, just visiting some friends in my hometown. He had just processed his divorce after being in a long-term relationship too of 15 years. His partner cheated on him.

I live in Europe, but “M” was based in Asia. I had no plans to dive into anything serious, but “M” was a breath of fresh air. He was kind, transparent, and emotionally supportive in a way I’d never experienced. He’d also recently been through a tough breakup after a long relationship. From the beginning, it felt like the world melted away when we spoke.

We started as friends, but it quickly became something deeper. Within a week, he’d written me a letter describing how he felt I was a soulmate and wanted me in his life. The connection felt genuine, and it grew slowly but intentionally. After I left, he visited me monthly (long international flights). He was consistently thoughtful, sending letters, flowers, and messages to show he was thinking of me. We found that we aligned on pretty much everything—life goals, values, dreams.

Then a couple of months ago, he started pulling away. His work became so ridiculously busy (I know his schedule) and he was applying for the job that he said would ""solve all of our problems"" as it's closer to me. He admitted that he wasn’t developing feelings as he thought he would due to the distance or him ""protecting himself"", which felt completely out of place given how affectionate and caring he’d been. The timing was tough because, due to some complications on my end, we hadn’t seen each other in about two months. We planned a trip together to a neutral city, which was amazing. But his best friend joined us unexpectedly, which changed the dynamic.

I told him how much I cared about him before I left, and he was sweet in response but didn’t say it back which was fine for me. Soon after, he started talking about applying for jobs in a different country, hoping it might “solve our problems.” Despite this, he remained distant, and eventually, he ended things. He attributed it to the long-distance factor and his feelings not changing.

Afterwards, I tried to go no-contact. But with the current state of the world, I felt compelled to reach out briefly. To my surprise, he responded warmly and suggested a call. We talked, and it felt like nothing had changed. He mentioned he didn’t get the job he thought would help us and his health concerns had become more serious. I mentioned that I’d be back in Asia soon, and he immediately suggested we meet for coffee, leaving the decision up to me to “protect my feelings.” I told him that’s my responsibility, not his.

Since then, we had a lighthearted text exchange, and I haven’t reached out further.

So, I’m struggling with a few questions: **Is it unwise to meet up with him again? Was I naive for believing his actions over his words? Is there any hope here? And if so, how can I maintain healthy boundaries without fully closing the door?**",1,1731423715.0,LongDistance,0,1.0,False

Week 13’s prompt is Confession ✨ Both Crowley and Aziraphale have had multiple revelations in the weeks following their rupture, and those revelations lead to some confessions.

The vibes in this are hopeful, emotional, healing and hopefully comforting at a frankly horrific time in the world. A happy ending as well ❤️ hope you enjoy and that everyone is hanging in there.

*Excerpt*:

Crowley first started calling Aziraphale *‘angel’* after he learned the origin of the name itself, and at first, Aziraphale did not know how he felt about it.

Despite having an angelic namesake all his life, or perhaps *because* of, he’s never felt particularly pure or good or whatever else angels are supposed to be, so it had been odd, it had been adjacent to *unnerving,* even, to be referred to as such. There were many manners in which Crowley came to say it as well, each of them as bewildering and admittedly beguiling as the last— flirtatiously, mischievously, desperately during the fury of whirlwind fucking and then so *softly,* after, warmly slurred into Aziraphale’s ear as Crowley drifted off to sleep, laying atop his chest with his fingers toying with Aziraphale’s curls or collar of his shirt— and it should have been an indicator of the feelings he did his best to strangle and ignore that Aziraphale quickly came to *love* the endearment after its initial period of peculiarity, that he fell fast and hard for it, coming to crave it being whispered and hissed or murmured to him, adoring the painfully lovely sensation of his long frostbitten heart beating back to fragile, blood flowing life again despite the terrifying sting of its rebirth; it should have been so very obvious to Aziraphale that he had *also* fallen fast and hard for Crowley himself.

Angels are also meant to be honest, and clearly, Aziraphale is also *not that—* not with himself, and certainly not with Crowley.

Yesterday we were giving meds, and here they keep meds in their cart in the room. I didnt realize I was about to give a med that was about 8 hours expired. Then today, I forgot to scan the breast milk before feeding a baby. Ever since the breast milk situation, she has been really short and rude with me. I heard her walk out the room saying ‘well i guess i actually have to work today’ she said this to whoever was sitting at the nurses station.
I apologized for forgetting, my mind was occupied with removing the NG tube which was my first time doing that. 
She then took coffee orders for everyone, she came up to me and said ‘what do you want?’ And i said ‘for what?’ Because i wasnt sure what she was pertaining to- she then scoffed and said in a rude tone ‘well what do you want?’ And i said
‘Are you getting coffee or something……’
And she said ‘yup.’
And i said no im good and she left. For the most part I am doing all the cares and charting. She just sits on her phone and twirls her hair the whole time im doing anything. She answers any questions i have, but i feel like if im not 100% perfect, she just gets annoyed of me.",2,1731423581.0,newgradnurse,0,1.0,False
1gpmm6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/nightterrors/comments/1gpmm6x/what_happens_when_medication_doesnt_work/,What happens when medication doesn't work? ,"Hello there. I am 23M and I live in Canada. I have been having night terrors since I was 5 years old off and on. As soon as I married my wife they sky rocketed to around 2-5 times per week. These involve short screams all the way to running around the house and throwing flurries of punches at the ""intruder"" in my door, lol!

I am writing this from my bed as Just this last night I threw my CPAP machine on the ground during a terror. 

We thought it was sleep apnea, but it happened every night even when I wear my mask (yes I have tried every pressure and mask in the book). I have been diagnosed with it. Mask comes off every night in about an hour due to a wake up or a night terror. It is usually 50/50. 

I don't have any known trauma in my childhood that would lead to this, I had a very loving family and no traumatic events. I am currently seeing a psychologist for this just to be sure, but we have found no results as of yet. 

I have been seeing my doctor, she prescribed beta blockers. I tell you they worked great for about a week and then stopped working all together. I am afraid to take a large dose as I have asthma and they make I hard to breathe. But I got 2+ hours of deep sleep for the first time in my life it felt like! It was amazing.

I am on CBD edibles (20mg), though they relax me I am not seeing much improvement. 

Here is the meds I take: 
Vyvanse for ADHD
Symbicort inhaler
Steroid nose spray (cant remember the name, but it's not the one that chases bad dreams) 
Beta blockers

Non prescription: 
Multivitamin x 2
Omega 3 x 4
Vit d 5000iu 
Milk thistle for liver
Ashwaganda x 2
Zinc citrate 50mg (new) 
Allergy meds (started 6 months ago) 
Pre workout
Non stim pre workout
Creatine 

I work out every day and am very active. Resistance training and steady state cardio. I am in the gym for usually 2 hours a day. I take my pre workout at 11am. It has 200mg of caffeine, I don't drink much else that is caffeinated. I might have 1 coffee per day before 3pm. 

Though active I am not lean, I am 246lb, currently in a fat lose phase (thank you married + college, haha!) 
Weight is coming off nicely and I am excited to see if it helps. 

Heart rates spikes around 2x about 1 hour into sleep, that is when I have night terrors. Normally only have 1 every two days, unless I am stressed and I might have two. Even still I wake up after an hour each night even without a night terror. 


I am trying to figure out what is going on. I am confused and don't know where to go from here. I have tried everything but a sleep study which I will hopefully be going for in a month or so, once my doctor gets back to me.

I want a full night's sleep very badly. Because of the wake ups I cannot wear my mask all night and it makes my sleep very poor.

I feel so bad for my wife, she has to deal with these every time. I think she is used to it now though, haha! 

I need your help, please send your ideas and I will respond as I am able! 

Thanks guys, much love! ",2,1731423573.0,nightterrors,0,1.0,False

anyways, obviously i won’t be texting her anymore. but i can’t get her off my mind, she’s the first person i’ve really clicked with for the last several years and i feel so stupid that i needed to be validated with sex instead of letting tension build. i need to forget her and move forward, but how do you guys get over this type of shit? any tips or tools that you’ve found helpful to heal this type of pain? thanks for reading if you got this far.

I knew it would make my life miserable for an entire month, but I went and let myself get re-addicted anyway because I was moving and had multiple big work deadlines and didn't have time to sleep enough and and and all the usual excuses and temptations, so I have nobody to blame but myself.

I'm on week 2 and I am so tired of waking up feeling sick, like a mild flu. This constant, awful, hot rancid garbage feeling, every morning no matter how much I sleep, and feeling angry and depressed all day, and the headache that even prescription painkillers don't help. It's getting better, like it always does, but always agonizingly slowly, like 5% each day, almost not enough to notice, and this is my life for the next few weeks if I'm lucky and don't cave in like I did last week and set my progress back by days for a single cup of coffee because I was miserable and exhausted and had so much work to do.

I hate that I did this to myself again, and I know I say it a lot when I'm going through withdrawal, but I still can't believe caffeine is legal and almost completely unregulated. This is (temporarily) ruining my life, and we just let children walk into Starbucks or grocery stores and buy hundreds of milligrams of this addictive drug as many times a day as they want. I'm not arguing for any specific legal change, but something is seriously wrong here.

Edit: I wanted to add, for anyone going through the same thing, there is a big beautiful light at the end of the tunnel without caffeine. You will wake up feeling refreshed and full of energy and mentally sharp and strong. Yes, if you're like me, it might take weeks (maybe even a month or more) of feeling sick and miserable, but I wouldn't be putting myself through this again if I didn't know how amazing it feels to come out the other side.

1gpm4ui,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gpm4ui/my_8year_friendship_is_at_risk_because_my_friend/,My 8-year friendship is at risk because my friend only focuses on her boyfriend. What should I do?,"I want to give you some context about what's been happening, so I'll try to be as straightforward as possible, even though the story is quite long. Essentially, my friend—let's call her ""Susan""—has been treating me terribly all year. We’ve known each other for eight years since a mutual friend from high school introduced us. Since then, I’ve considered her my best friend, confidante, and the person I felt closest to.

However, in the summer of 2022, I moved abroad for work and to continue my studies there. I decided to extend my stay to further my education, but when my contract ended, I came back to my home country to continue my university studies. While I was living alone in a foreign country, Susan stopped talking to me. She would leave my messages on read, and over the course of a year, we only had two video calls. It felt as though she had completely distanced herself from me, which hurt a lot. I would message her to check in, but she showed no interest in my life. This was particularly upsetting because she lives in a nearby neighborhood, just a 15-minute bus ride away, and we used to meet up for walks and long chats almost daily.

When I returned in the summer of 2023, she told me she had a boyfriend and that they had been dating for several months. This made sense to me as it explained why she had been ignoring me, but it felt odd that she hadn’t mentioned it before. By 2024, they had been dating for two years, which meant she started seeing him around the time I left in 2022. Yet, I didn’t find out until the following year and still can’t understand why she kept it from me.

In 2023, I came back excited to reconnect with my friends, whom I hadn’t seen in a long time. But I realized that during my time away, they had moved on with their lives and were no longer used to having me around. Even though I made an effort as soon as I returned, organizing a friend’s birthday party, Susan was always unavailable. She had found a job, and when she wasn’t working, she spent her time with her boyfriend. It’s worth mentioning that Susan is two years older than me and has already finished her studies, while I’m still at university and have a part-time job in the afternoons.

That same year, I wanted to celebrate my birthday with her. My birthday is in November, but for various reasons, she was never available—not even for a coffee. When her birthday came around in February 2024, I insisted on going out to a restaurant to celebrate with her, even though she hadn’t celebrated mine. I also bought her several gifts. It was during that celebration that she gave me my birthday gift *three months late*, and honestly, it was a huge disappointment.

She had made me a pair of cat-shaped earrings, which were essentially hardened black clay with two ears and visible fingerprints on them. One of them was even glued on backward and couldn’t be worn properly. In contrast, I had given her thoughtful gifts: a card game, a tote bag, and a wallet. I put effort into finding things she would like, even though I bought them on a budget. The earrings she made were hideous, and I couldn’t even wear them. My mom, who used to run a handmade jewelry store with a friend, also thought they were poorly made and rushed.

This hurt me deeply because she had months to find a decent gift, and what she gave me felt like she hadn’t put any thought or care into it. We’re adults now, and although she works and doesn’t have to cover any expenses since she lives with her parents, she still gave me that. It made me feel offended and disappointed that she hadn’t put the same effort into her gift as I had.

Then I wondered if she might be struggling financially, but that seemed unlikely. A few months later, her boyfriend's birthday came up, and she was the one who contacted me for the first time in a long while to go shopping with her. Her boyfriend is really into video games and anime, like me, so she wanted me to help pick out a gift. Despite feeling that she didn’t deserve my help, I agreed. That day, she bought him an €80 Goku figurine, a PS5 game, a jacket, and a matching tie to coordinate with her dress for a wedding they were attending that summer. Altogether, it cost around €300. So, clearly, she has money but only spends it on her boyfriend or trips they take together.

Honestly, after that, I felt really hurt and didn’t reach out to her or meet up all summer. However, recently I decided to contact her early to plan my birthday celebration this month. I suggested meeting the last weekend of November, as I’m in university in the mornings and work until 8 p.m., so that would be the best time for me. She said she couldn’t make it because she would be with her boyfriend. We ended up meeting this past Saturday, even though my birthday is still three weeks away.

To top it all off, I had to pick her up with my car (she doesn’t like taking the bus), and after we ate at the restaurant, she didn’t give me a gift. I was surprised and asked her about it, and she told me she hadn’t had time to buy one. I had informed her on November 1st, and we met on the 9th—more than enough time to get something. Yet, she came empty-handed.

It’s worth mentioning that Susan only works mornings and has her afternoons free. She lives just a 10-minute walk from a shopping center, so I genuinely believe she simply didn’t bother to buy anything. I’m not difficult to please and appreciate many things, so it felt especially hurtful.

Honestly, I don’t know what to think anymore. My heart feels heavy, and I’m unsure whether to keep giving her chances. During our conversation, I brought up the fact that we never hang out anymore because she’s always with her boyfriend. She said she needs to nurture her relationship because he will be the father of her future children, which I understand, but what about friends? Are we really going to throw away an eight-year friendship over a boyfriend?

Figured my experience might help if anyone else is on the fence before BF.

***To get into the details, the Surfshark Black Friday offer this year is actually pretty solid:***

* It’s like up to 87% off with an extra 4 months free
* The price came down to around $2.49 a month for a 2-year plan. 
* I took the Surfshark One because I took some additional features with it but you can get Surfshark itself for as low as $1.99.

Honestly, that’s probably one of the better deals I’ve seen for any VPN this year. I saw some other channels offering different pricing for Surfshark but as I bought via [this link](https://surfshark.com/deals?coupon=REDDITSPECIAL) (it applies **REDDITSPECIAL** discount automatically), the pricing was the best I could find. I mean, I think that’s less than a coffee each month, and for something that covers my internet use across all devices.

***My feedback since the purchase***

1. **Setup**: I’ve been using it for a few days now, and the setup was pretty easy even for the 1st time users. Just downloaded it on my phone, laptop, and a couple of other devices. What’s cool about Surfshark is that it doesn’t limit how many devices you can connect at once. That’s something I looked for because I tend to bounce between my tablet, phone, and laptop, plus sometimes I share with family, and I don’t want to think about hitting a cap.
2. **CleanWeb feature:** One thing I really like so far is the CleanWeb feature, which is basically an ad blocker. It’s not that I mind ads generally, but some websites go overboard, and it’s just nice to have less clutter when I’m browsing. It’s also supposed to block trackers, which I haven’t tested much yet, but I figure it can’t hurt.
3. **Speed:** In terms of speed, which is usually my main concern with VPNs, I haven’t noticed any big issues. I’ve been able to stream and browse without any lag or buffering (knock on wood), which was a pleasant surprise. The location selection is also decent—I think it’s over 100 different places.

Overall, the Surfshark Black Friday deal might be a good option if you’re looking to try a VPN without spending a ton. I’d say give it a look before the discount ends, especially if you’ve been considering getting more privacy for streaming, browsing, or even just general internet use.",0,1731422100.0,vpnreviews,0,0.5,False

1gplwqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeMoneyOnlinefree/comments/1gplwqr/prime_opinion_a_fun_way_to_earn_money_by_taking/,Prime Opinion: A Fun Way to Earn Money by Taking Surveys,"Prime Opinion offers an easy and enjoyable way to make money online. The main goal of the app is to **collect points by taking surveys and then convert those points into cash.** Plus, you can increase your earnings with some extra features and bonuses. Let’s dive into how Prime Opinion works and explore its advantages together!

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Earn Money by Taking Surveys

All you need to do on Prime Opinion is fill out the surveys provided. **You earn a certain number of points for each survey, and as your points accumulate, you can reach your rewards faster.** The surveys are usually short and simple, meaning you can earn money while sipping your coffee! ☕💸

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Earn by Playing Games: Sometimes Easy, Sometimes Challenging 🤨

Prime Opinion isn’t just limited to surveys. You can **earn points by playing some games as well.** However, the rewards here can be a bit inconsistent. For example, while the reward system in some games is reasonable, others make it extremely difficult to win big prizes. But if you’re a fan of those games, who am I to judge? If you manage to find games that truly pay off, you can definitely **kill two birds with one stone!** 🎮🕹️

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Complete Surveys for 7 Days and Enter a 1,000-Point Raffle! 🎁

Prime Opinion rewards your active participation. **If you fill out at least one survey every day for seven consecutive days, you get a chance to win up to 1,000 points in a raffle.** You pick one of the 24 boxes to try your luck. So far, I’ve managed to win a maximum of 500 points ($5) from these raffles. **500 points isn’t bad—it’s enough to cover my coffee expenses!** ☕💸 I try to keep up with the weekly streak to participate in the raffle every seven days.

 \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Level System: Extra Benefits as You Level Up 📈

The app features a **level system,** where you earn extra points and unlock new features every time you level up. **It’s possible to earn more with new features,** so leveling up really does help. In a way, this adds a bit of an RPG (role-playing game) vibe to the whole experience. Who knows, maybe one day I’ll reach level 99 and earn the title of ""Survey King."" 👑😂

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Use My Link and Get a +10% Bonus for the First 24 Hours! 🎉

If you **sign up for Prime Opinion using my referral link,** you’ll get a +10% point bonus for surveys completed within the first 24 hours. **This means you can rack up points faster without missing out on opportunities.** Both you and I benefit—welcome to the winners' club! 🎉  
[Sign up with my link!](https://primeopinion.com/register?ref=9c96e30f-0b8a-4d24-98b6-b58165ffb117)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Leaderboard System: ""More Surveys, More Points,"" But Not Easy 😅

There’s also a **leaderboard system** on Prime Opinion, but earning points from it requires serious effort. **I haven’t earned anything from the leaderboard so far,** since it demands filling out a massive number of surveys. I guess becoming a ""survey warrior"" will take a bit more time. But who knows, maybe one day I’ll conquer the entire leaderboard! 🏆😂

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Create Virtual Credit Cards with Your Earned Points 💳

With the points you earn from Prime Opinion, you can create virtual credit cards. The best part is that **you can customize these cards with any name you want.** Use it for yourself or create a card as a gift for a friend. I was disappointed to find that it didn’t work on a local shopping site, but it worked flawlessly on Amazon. **So basically, you can say ""I'm earning my own money"" while shopping on Amazon.** It’s not exactly being a modern-day Robin Hood, but hey, close enough! 📦🎁

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prime Opinion is a great option for those who want to make some extra money by making the most of small time slots. **Whether you're waiting somewhere or traveling by public transport, you have the chance to earn a little extra cash.** As the saying goes, ""Little drops make the mighty ocean."" I invite you all to start earning. This app can make a big difference with small efforts. **Come on, let’s earn together!**",1,1731421610.0,MakeMoneyOnlinefree,1,1.0,False

The crew of the Nexus were a sad lot. Maybe it was the cold interior of the ship or that none of them had anything really back on earth, but that never stopped me from trying to help them. No matter how many times I had to pull Captain Vas out of the bottle or distract private Sami from just staring at the wall, I still tried. We had a mission to complete after all, one that was vitally important for all of humanity's survival, and we couldn't have anyone getting distracted. I was lucky that NASA trained me in a ton of different things, seeing as I was the only volunteer (kind of). So I could fill in with navigation or mechanics if either of my other crewmates were drunk or lost in their own world. It was on one of those such days, when I was fixing the dehydrator, private Sami stumbled into the room looking exhausted. She looked over to me and her eyes lit up a bit, finally gaining a bit of life for the first time in five days. She was clutching one of her personal items, a small photograph of her family. Based on the young boy standing in the front, I supposed it was probably from a long time ago. She sat down at the table I was working at and buried her face in her arms  and let out a soft groan. I waited until she spoke from her cocoon of fabric to acknowledge her. 

“Hey Sabel, why are you here?” I turned to her, confused expression on my face “Like, philosophically or realistically. ‘cause I already told you and the Captain I'm here cause of a court order.” “I don't know what I mean.” She looks back up at me, tears beginning to form in her eyes “Why are you so cheerful?” I shrugged, tossing her a clean cloth to wipe her eyes with “This is important and the only way to move forward is to be cheerful” She chuckled using the cloth and nodded in agreement “I suppose. I-” she looked back up to me “I hope you know I'm trying-” feeling that she was about to spiral again I interrupted her “It's fine, I know. This” I waved to the ship behind us “is hard.” she nodded in agreement, sighing. After I finished the repair, we ate dinner together. I love spending time together, always have been a people person. So, instead of pressuring her to talk more, I put on a good song and we hummed along to it together. Eventually, after I got the dehydrator working and we were eating one of the better tasting meals they had came prepared with, Captain Vas stumbled into the mess, the bags under her eyes speaking more of exhaustion than drunkenness, and tumbled onto the floor. Sami ran over to help her over and I rushed to make her a cup of tea. 

As I handed it to her she grumbled and said “Sable get me a coffee I have duties.” I sighed. This was just like her, when she wasn't drunk, she was usually working. I decided today was not the day for that and said “Vas, Sami and I have everything down. Just… get some rest.” her face twisted in annoyance and she said “this is my ship, you will-” she promptly fell asleep at the table. Sami looked at our captain sympathetically but seemed too lost in her own issues to do anything, until I gestured for her to help me carry the captain to the couch in our main room. It wasn't the most comfortable, but she seemed to be thoroughly knocked out and I didn't want her to wake up back in her depression nest. Sami protested a little at going into the captain’s room to clean, but she knew just as well as I that that it was bad for her to be surrounded by the countless bottles of alcohol littering her floor. I stopped to examine a small photograph on the floor of the captain standing in front of a beautiful valley and holding a young child. She had told me when she first met that I reminded her of her son; just a kid who had made a mistake. Her voice broke so much that I didn't have the heart to tell her she was wrong. We finished in pretty good time and went back to the couch to find Captain awake and staring blankly at the tv. Sami and I settled down next to her and she pulled me into a hug. I didn't complain though, it's been a while since someone held me like that. 

I was awake early, as always the next morning. Back on earth I loved to wake up early to see the sunrise, especially with my little sister. There wasn't any sunrise here but it was nice to get chores out of the way early, so I could spend the rest of the day playing video games and watching movies. They had stocked the ship pretty well, and I was determined to play all the high fantasy platformers they had before the end of the mission. It was odd, back on earth my favorite genera had been sci-fi, but now that I was in space all i wanted to do was play games set on earth. Or alien planets. I was a bit sad we wouldn't be exploring any alien worlds, but saving the world seemed like a good enough condolence. I turned around when I heard clinking in the sink behind me. The captain had laid an armful of bottles on the table and was draining them into the sink. As much as I wanted to keep a few I didn't stop her, knowing just as well as she did what would happen if she didn't. After she was done she walked over and pulled me into a tight hug and I swore I heard her whisper an apology to her son. We broke apart when Sami walked in, looking a little less lost than yesterday and actually smiling for the first time I’d seen. She looked pretty when she smiled, it made the light shine off her hazel eyes. 

“Hey uh Sable? Did you get the transmission device to work again? I want to send a message to my family” I nodded, not wanting to remind her we’d be done with our mission by the time they got back to earth. The idea freaked me out way too much to do. But I got it set up for her and left the room so she could send her family a message in private. Captain was picking at a rehydrated meal at the table and she looked up at me when I came over. “Is she still- sending them messages? Even though” I nodded, cutting her off. “Yeah. Did you uh- send any” she shook her head. I hadn't either, though it's not like they would want to hear it. Sami always reminded me of my sister enough anyway. I rocked awkwardly on my feet “so… were going past a planet today. It's supposed to be pretty, Purple and stuff, at 08:00. Do you think you're up to it?” She's silent for a moment before I see her looking at me through the curtain of her black hair. She nods. By the time I'm done prepping my food Sami has returned. She seemed much more smiley, the tear tracks around her eyes were much less visible then they were the last few times she had sent messages to her family.

When the end of our journey came, we sat on the observation deck. Sami leaned against me for comfort, just like my sister used to and Vas sat on our other side, just watching and telling us about her son. They might not miss us but we will be heroes. The sun was warm as it consumed us.

So, I can say I began to notice symptoms as early as 36/37..random hot flashes but noting consistent, maybe once a month? The first real symptom I can remember noticing was vomitting either right before or the first day of my cycle, just once in the morning, almost like morning sickness but truly after 1 puking incident I'd be 100% fine..which was odd, but I put it down to I'm getting older and we change as we age..maybe this is just a new fun symptom I'll have before I end up in menopause...at the time I had no idea perimenopause was even a thing! I thought it was menopause or nothing. 

Fast foreward to last 2 years ago, I'm 38 years old working as a travel RN and traveling to hospitals within an hour to 2 hour radius from my home so I can commute. I am night shift and everyone told me I was nuts for driving all that way after working but it's never bothered me in the past. I've always worked kind of far from home or travelled for My job (home health or hospice for 7 years). I noticed that I was getting very VERY tired after what I'd consider a normal amount of sleep for a night shifters, like some days I could barely hold my eyes open without an abundant amount of coffee. I also noticed that I was wear layers under my scrubs, like a pair of leggings under them and a thin shirt, under my long sleeved shirt under my scrub top. I was ALWAYS freezing, shaking sometimes I was so cold. I had some labs done and my blood levels were fine. I figured again it was just me getting older and old, thin ladies are always cold. Speaking of weight, I actually had weight LOSS during this time, not gain as well as heart burn and indigestion mostly at night which I noticed considering I work nights.

After I completed a local commute contract I couldn't find anything comparable pay wise to travel locally and had to travel and stay about 3 hours away from my family..it was here I lost my whole mind. My anxiety had been kicking up since I began traveling but I thought it was just the nature of the job, we can literally be canceled for any reason so I felt like I had to always be on my A game. During this contract it was awful, I felt like every coping mechanism I'd learned during my life, failed. I've had anxiety my entire life but this was new, this was call of the void, drive your car into oncoming traffic bad. 
I obviously didn't do that and completed that contract. Took another within commuting distance and the anxiety got no better..but during this time my gallbladder decided to go bad so I shoved off ALL OF THOSE ABOVE LISTED SYMPTOMS as years of jy gallbladder going bad...only alot of those symptoms never went away after I had it out. My indigestion got better but I began to noticed I would feel great DURING my peroid, but inbetween just had alot of days of not feeling well..not sick? Just run down with 0 energy and 0 mental drive to do anything.

I'm still having alot of the symptoms and I took a stupid 'am I in menopause' quiz with a reading of YES. I know those aren't accurate at all and I've called a NEW OB doc (mine refused to test my hormone levels and just wanted to shivering birth control in my face) and I'm waiting on a call back. I was curious what your experiences are..below I'll list what's happening to me and the testing I've had..

1gplvop,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1gplvop/do_you_think_children_can_attend_church_on/,Do you think children can attend church on Sundays without being indoctrinated? Discussing with my GF how to raise future kids,"So, my girlfriend (25F) recently became Mormon. For context, some of her family is Mormon, and she grew up occasionally attending church on Sundays but was never baptized until recently. I did my own research on the church and brought up its big issues, but she said she doesn’t mind because, to her, no church is perfect. For her, church attendance is about feeling closer to God and participating in the sacrament, which seems very spiritual and personally meaningful to her.

It's worth noting that she doesn’t actually follow any of the church’s rules—she still drinks coffee and alcohol, we have sex, she doesn’t tithe, and she has openly stated she doesn’t plan on doing the endowment ceremony. She also does not really believe on the BoM and other scriptures.

Everything was fine until we started talking about how we’d raise kids if we have them. She mentioned wanting to take them to church on Sundays. I’m really opposed to that idea, mainly because I’m concerned about the potential damage and don’t believe the church environment would be healthy for them. She countered by saying that she thinks it's important for children to have some sense of spirituality—something she wishes she had growing up—and that we could teach our kids to question everything so they wouldn’t just blindly follow. To her, a couple of hours every Sunday wouldn’t be harmful.

I don't agree with her position. I feel strongly that exposing our future kids to this environment could lead to them being indoctrinated. By indoctrination, I mean them eventually feeling pressured to follow church rules strictly. I’d love to hear from people who left the church: Is it possible for kids to grow up attending church without being affected in this way? If not, how would you suggest I approach this with her? What would you, as someone who was raised Mormon, tell her? 

She already knows about the issues with the Book of Mormon, Book of Abraham, and polygamy but says that’s not why she attends. For her, it’s purely about feeling closer to God, and that’s the part she’d want to share with our kids. However, I think she is severely downplaying the negative aspects of the church and their potential impact on our children.

TLDR: My GF says she would like to raise our children attending the church on Sundays. She says we can make it work by teaching them to question everything so that they don't blindly accept everything they hear. I disagree but would like to hear from you, is this possible?

I envy the people that know for sure, that their loved one is dead, I envy them because they know where their bodies are, I envy them because they had a funeral, I envy them because they know what happened to them. And it hurts, because I don't have ashes nor a headstone to cry on, we never had a funeral for him, I don't have anything, except for a few items that belonged to him, and a few great memories he gave us. I guess it feels as if it's always haunting me, hanging over my head, because I have no closure, it doesn't even feel as if he's dead, it just... is.

Sometimes I wonder if he just got tired of us and he decided to abandon us and start over somewhere, maybe it's wishful thinking? At least he wouldn't be dead. But I know he loved us, i know for a fact he loved me, because I was his princess, and I remember that time when he bought me flowers after my dance recital, I remember how he smiled every time he looked at me, I remember how he used to carry me on his shoulders, gosh, I remember how we used to love watching documentaries together about wild animals, that was our thing, I remember how I used to get up early to help him make his coffee, I remember the songs he used to play for me and my sister during the car ride to drop us off at our school. He loved us, he was a man dedicated to his family, dedicated to his job, a very loving man, the greatest dad in the world.

I've now been alive for longer than I ever got to know my dad, I've lived long enough without him, for me to have already, for the most part, forgotten his voice. It's so weird, because I feel like I can still remember it, but the exact tone and cadence don't come to my mind, it's as if it's sand slipping through my fingers.

We stop at traffic lights. Even as we move from post-code to post-code, from rows of terraced houses to copper coffee shops and fairy-light bordered warehouses stacked with beer barrels, the gaps in-between remain the same: brick-scattered sand pits and layers of scaffolding with a photograph on a wall advertising what it should have been - new affordable flats with a built-in gym, a new café, a new community centre.

Hello everyone.

This is a second draft excerpt from a book I am writing. I am writing a non-fiction book (names changed etc) about my experience of complex mental health difficulties. The book is not a self-help book - it is about the reality of living with mental illness from my own experience and exploring my own history as I grapple with another recovery. It is about the messy reality of mental illness and how it is about getting up, falling down, and getting up again, and what I have learned from each relapse, building one picture of the hidden difficulties we all face and how they shape a person.

I am in the beginning stages of writing this, and would really appreciate some feedback on both my idea and also on my writing.

1gplrqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/starseeds/comments/1gplrqe/there_is_no_substitute_for_authentic_genuine/,There is no substitute for authentic genuine vulnerability and LOVE. (Field Report),"Hello fellow Star Seeds and Light Workers.  Our super power is transparency and being genuine when we're leaning in and helping others.  We have empathy in spades.  It's our path.  It's why we have been through so much.  It comes at a high price.  It's so so worth it.

&nbsp;

Yes, this is a gift.  It's not something that everyone has the ability to use.  IT IS my super power.  

Do you know why?  Because I've used my dark nights and awakening to heal.  When you are healed or healing.......because of the horrible shit we've walked through you can use it to help others.

&nbsp;

I ran into an old friend who was betrayed by his wife.  Similar story as mine.  And so I've learned especially with men.......just to go first.  I cannot be hurt and my story cannot be weaponized against me.

&nbsp;

Like most, his eyes got as big as saucers because he cannot believe I'm sharing the things I went through.  Just pure and genuine transparency.

I have this because I've been working on myself.  ALL OF ME.  The good\bad\fun.

Sometimes in the midst of our trauma we can lose the good fun qualities that make us.

&nbsp;

Anyway, what I've also learned is that sometimes when people feel free to share their stuff after I go first that they feel better after getting it out.  Yes, it's ugly.  I mean who wants to vomit?  No one.

I've noticed that once they get it out that there's a glow about them.  That even though what they deemed as horrible or gross.........they felt safe enough to share.

They almost have no choice once I go first because I set the table.  Like sheesh maybe my stuff isn't so bad.


&nbsp;

As Star Seeds and Light Workers this is key.  Maybe you don't have to be me and share your scars like I do.  I've just dialed it in.  I'm highly perceptive and intuitive.

&nbsp;

The best part for me is that they feel heard.  Validated.  Most of all they feel love from me.  

&nbsp;

I met someone two years ago and she asked me what I'm passionate about.  I think she expected me to say career or some money making opportunity.

When I told her ""I just want to look people in the eye and them to feel love"" she didn't expect that.

&nbsp;

Two years later I've found that this is happening more and more.  One person at a time.

&nbsp;

That hard thing for me is because there is so much lying and deceit and manipulation people don't know how to react to my pureness.  They are skeptical.  They think there's a catch.  

&nbsp;

One person as a time.  One conversation.  A coffee or meal together.  And I get to spread pure love.  Without guilt or shame.

&nbsp;

This is why I was put on this planet.  I'm the mobile lighthouse.  And I trust that one person at a time I can help set them free like I was.

&nbsp;

Onward and upward my friends :)",5,1731421217.0,starseeds,1,0.86,False
1gplpqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthBayLA/comments/1gplpqa/seeking_office_kitchen_use_in_south_bay/,Seeking Office + Kitchen Use in South Bay,"Dear Reddit Community,

I have been working in Hollywood for over a decade. The industry is a complete mess right now and very much on life support. Scores of people are losing their houses, failing to pay their rent and other bills, and often moving out of Los Angeles to cheaper markets. Even going back home to live with their parents when that is an option.

I had to move out of my duplex in NoHo last month when I couldn't find a single prospective roommate that could afford half the rent, nor could I find any sustainable work to float the $3k a month rent (Note - I was splitting the place with my former roommate who had to move back to his hometown because he couldn't find any work either).

For now, I am living out of my car with my excess personal belongings (clothes, etc.) in a storage unit in the Manhattan Beach area. I consider myself to be fortunate to even be able to do that. I see so many other people that are living out of their cars and on the street and it's heartbreaking. Tbh, I could never see myself living in LA again. The whole city feels so dystopian these days. It's definitely not the same city that I fell in love with when I first moved out here in 2004.

Le sigh.

Whatever it's flaws might be, South Bay seems like a much more pleasant place to be if I am going to stay in SoCal.

While I have most of the essentials covered for now (working out of libraries, applying for jobs, showering at the gym, using my EBT card to get food, sleeping in the back seat of my Dodge, etc.), there are a couple gaps that I could use some help with. I am totally fine with continuing to do all of these things on my own, but here's where I could use some help:

Kitchen access - My EBT card gets me $300 a month in groceries but we are only allowed to purchase uncooked food and it's hard to fully utilize that budget when you don't have a kitchen to cook in or a fridge to store food. Food pantries don't really help either. More uncooked food. I've got the pots and pans. Just need a stove or a place where I could plug in a hot plate. A garage could totally work. Right now I'm stuck with getting food that I can eat straight off of the shelves or things that I can heat up in a microwave at a local 7-11 as long as they play nice. I can only spend about $10 a day so it definitely takes some strategizing and catching things on clearance or sale. I'm trying to avoid eating crap food as my weight and cholesterol was recently the highest it's ever been. Depression dieting (or the lack thereof) is very real.

Office and/or workspace access - Right now, I'm working out of public libraries for the most part. It's doable but I've learned that libraries often have limited or funky hours to contend with these days. Maybe it's budget cuts. I dunno. For instance, today is Veterans Day, and while I'm typically all for the observance of federal holidays, therefore all public libraries are closed, but I'm not really in a position to take an entire day off given my current situation. I need to work as diligently as possible every day so I can find solutions to the urgent issues I'm facing. It could be an unused office, or a garage, ADU, extra bedroom, living room, common area, or anywhere else. For instance, the best library hours I could find yesterday (Sunday) in South Bay were for the Manhattan Beach library which was open from 1-5p. I literally drove all the way up to UCLA to work in the main library here which was open from 12-9p. I'm typing up this message on my laptop in Westwood right now lol. To be clear, I'm not asking for a free place to stay. Just a free place to work. I have no problem with sleeping in my car, etc. I just want to be able to put in a 8-12 hour workday or whatever is needed without having to jump through hoops to find a place. I've done the coffee shops, Barnes and Nobles, etc. The biggest barrier with those places is that either they don't have power outlets readily available or there's an expectation that you have to spend money to get a seat.

Jobs - If anyone is hiring... let me know and I can send my resume upon request. I've actually quit Hollywood and am transitioning to a career in tech, but I am open to all opportunities and could possibly be a good fit for positions in marketing, media, sports, events, and the nonprofit sector.

Any leads or opportunities would be greatly appreciated! Feel free to share or crosspost. I will avoid the urge to repost in other subs until there's at least a decent amount of eyes on this or at least a week or so has passed. If I don't get any leads by then I might repost. Don't hate me. I'm just trying to get back on my feet asap! I'm even considering a move to Las Vegas just to have a lower cost of living.
