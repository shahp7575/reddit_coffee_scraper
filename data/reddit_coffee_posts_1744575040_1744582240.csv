1jyjefn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueNarcissisticAbuse/comments/1jyjefn/4_years_later_and_i_finally_blocked_them/,4 years later and I finally blocked them.,"Hello Everyone, 

I officially blocked my NEX after going through a roller coaster with her. 

Long story short - we met 4 years ago. It was an immediate connection nothing I had ever felt before. 

She said she was in process of leaving her husband and sent me divorce papers to prove it.

About 3 months later. I found out it was all lie. She forged the papers 
She was still living with him but was "" planning on leaving"" 
I hung on to that for a while. 

Even when she would beat me down.
You're fat, you talk to much, why aren't you strong and muscular, why can't you be a real man instead of a lil bit** 

That's not even all of it. 

Anyways. I left my hometown for a few state blocked her for about 3 months but ended up unblocking her because I missed her. 

Bad idea.

I went back home to see family and we ended up getting dinner together. 

Bad idea again. 

She claimed that she was going to fly out and spend time with me. 
But because I didn't pick up my phone within 5 minutes she said I guess I didn't care. 

So instead she flew out here. 
Call me that she was here in my city and that she wanted to get coffee with me but conveniently within 20  minutes of planning this.
Her husband randomly flew out to the same state. 

She ended up blocking me and not talking to me until about 4 days later 

She sent me pictures of how she was near my neighborhood and how do I went to all the little spots that I told her I was going to take her to. 

I ended up losing it. 
This was the end of the line for abuse. 
I sent her text message asking her just to leave me alone and then I'm done and I blocked her. 

She had me blocked on social media and unblocked me only to send me a long message to tell me how big of a bitch I am and sent me a picture of a trash can and said she saw this and it reminded her of me.

I ended up finally exploding on her and calling her out for all of her BS which as narcissists do she deflected it all and put the blame on me for being my fault "" not being a man enough"" not giving her enough security to give me the chance. 

While I was in blocked I finally looked at her feed had been about 2 years. 

And when I went on her feed.

All of the dates we talked about. 
Everything that we had planned to do together even some little special dates that I have been saving to share with someone special. 

She did it all with him. 
She went as far as to make him look like me. 
She has him wearing the exact same style of clothing that I wear 
Down to the jewelry 
And down to how I style my facial hair. 

I was so beyond shell shocked and livied.

I'm still feeling pretty empty I don't understand what was so horrible about me that she didn't want to be with me and that she felt the need to toy with me in my emotions but I am beyond confused as to why she's even making her husband look like me. 

Like if she obsessed with something that she couldn't leave her life for I don't understand? 

And that's not even the hardest part it's like after everything that we've been through the past few years and seeing all this weird stuff 

Even after blocking her I feel like my life is so quiet now. 
And I know this is what peace is supposed to sound like but it has been such a weird adjustment. 
I'm going on day 14 today. 

Has anyone felt this, the silence and the subtle sensation of missing them? 

We know the did us wrong, we know they are awful
But I can't help but miss them a little bit. 

I've been trying to just hook up with people again to cover it up but I just find myself so emotionless through the whole entire process that I don't even know if it's good for me anymore. 

Thank you for taking the time read and listen. 💚",1,1744582029.0,TrueNarcissisticAbuse,0,1.0,False
1jyje3u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jyje3u,First prints from a recent lurker,"The yellow in the first one has since faded, but it sounds like I need to add citric acid to the bath to avoid that—although honestly I kind of like the look.

For the second piece I made an image transfer onto packing tape to create a film positive and toned the print with coffee. Highly recommend this method if you like the creepy film negative look. (It fits the vibe of a weird art project I’ve been working on.) 

The third piece is part of the same weird art project and I wanted and extra grungy image so I bathed the paper in worchestershire sauce before applying the chemicals 🤭. It’s smelly and ugly which is exactly what I was going for.

I’ve got a long way to go to get as good as some of the beautiful work I’ve seen on here, but I’m happy with everything so far. ",1,1744582003.0,cyanotypes,0,1.0,False
1jyjcij,https://i.redd.it/42s5lsimdoue1.jpeg,Whiskey Review #1 - Eagle Rare 10 Year Bourbon,"#Eagle Rare 10 Year Bourbon

Kentucky, U.S. - Frankfort

#Current price

$56.99

#Age statement

10 Years

#Strength

90 Proof

#Appearance

Eagle rare has a clear brown appearance, with a medium intensity. Not as dark as I’d expect for a ten year age, due to the dilution.

#Nose

The nose is clean & has a medium intensity nose dominated by corn & barrel notes. The strongest note to me is a sweet butterscotch, reminiscent of a Werthers candy. Secondary notes of toffee, vanilla, sawdust, & a super mild coffee. I also get slight rancio notes of candied fruit. 

#Palate

Medium intensity with an off-dry sweetness. There’s a smooth & mouthfilling texture that wraps around & covers the palate. The notes are quiet - it hits the tongue with a sweet corn note, but the mid palate quickly turns into a dominant menthol.  The finish is rough for 90 proof, & is lead by leather & tobacco, with some gentler apple notes being a little hidden. The transition feels like you’ve had a small manikin of creamed corn for dinner & then had a short Newport for desert. The finish is very long & leaves the palate super dry once the thickness eventually goes away, but leaves some of those apple notes to linger on the cheeks.

#Quality & Rubric

1 - Faulty - Something has gone wrong during or post production, & the product is faulty.

2 - poor - Product misses on most or all desired characteristics.

3 - acceptable - Product does what it is supposed to do, with nothing standing out for better or worse.

4 - good - Product does some things to an above average level, & not much wrong.

5 - very good - Product does everything very well, or does a few things perfectly.

6 - outstanding - Product is near perfect. Hits on complexity for aroma, taste, & finish.

#Final Thoughts & verdict

Rating - 3.8/6

Overall, the bourbon grows on you as you continue to sip. The nose is pleasant & inviting. The taste profile is pleasant at times, but contrasted by barrel flavors that are a little too aggressive. It isn’t a hard whiskey to sort through, there’s some complexity, but it mostly comes from the extreme contrasts, & not a place of depth. The finish is long & also has a mix of pleasantries, with some fruit lingering, but contrasts with a dry bitterness. It reminds me a bit of eating an apple, with some wonderful sweetness hitting you at times, & the bitter & thick peel hitting you at other times.

The bottle is pretty, your house guests are likely going to want to try it if they’re into whiskey, & the price is solid, if you can find it for under $70. Nothing about this bottle is particularly unique or noteworthy, but nothing is very disappointing either. It’s enjoyable, & has a better than average aroma in particular, but won’t introduce you to anything new. I think most people would be pleased with it. This is a good product, & the price point is fair. ",3,1744581883.0,bourbon,1,1.0,False

Currently working in US based Social development sector org with office in India, previous work ex: management research/IT start up.
Fall 2025 was my second time applying for MBA. Fall 2024, I applied to 9 schools interview with 4 but converted none. This time around I only applied to Harvard, MIT, UWash, Tepper & McDonough. Tepper currently waitlisted me, but McDonough offered $50k(applied in R2). The scholarship seems generous from what i heard from current Indian students. But, i am struggling rn with how the current US administration scenario is.
I have a good personal story and had an amazing career growth in the past couple of years and think that I can get into a better school. Not badmouthing GTown, i really like it but it’s still not M7 or T15.

have few questions, i’d be grateful if anyone has the patience to answer:

1. In current safety, security, political situation, is it a right move to uproot to DC?
2. I love my job, but social development sector pays less and I’m interested in moving to consulting. What kinda opportunities does McDonough open up for consulting or healthcare specifically?
3. I am scared that if i defer, i scholarship will anyway go away but what if they don’t offer the same kind of scholarship later next year? I am also worried about if i’ll covert other schools if i apply for fall 2026. Thoughts? (I know this is more of a personal fear)
4. McDonough doesn’t really seem to have a great footing in MBB except of few alumni, and I did the math, if MBB+Big4 were to choose a pool of students to hire in their firms, they’d choose from the 10k odd students graduating from M7+T15. Am i wrong in thinking like this?
5. Apart from the $50k scholarship, id have to take 1.3cr rupees minimum to afford the degree, is it worth it? 

I have been really positive so far. The deadline for first deposit is April 21st and I’ve been having second thoughts to rather defer this year and apply widely next year. Everything else i’ve heard from the current and previous students about the school, teaching faculty, coffee chats with alumni, career services, cohort seems to be great but I need a consulting placement and my mind is torn between deferring and taking it. Help! 

Please throw in all and every opinion, i shall take them with a pinch of salt. ",1,1744581783.0,MBA,0,1.0,False

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! 🌟 

Have you ever noticed how some habits are like anchors weighing you down when you’re trying to sail smoothly through your day? I’ve had my fair share of those, but let me spill the tea on one habit I dropped that totally changed the game for my focus. 

**Let me hit you with this: Social media scrolling. 🙈** 

Yeah, I know, shocking, right? We all love a little mindless scroll now and then, but here’s the kicker: It was turning my brain into mashed potatoes. 🥔💥

### Here’s how saying “bye-bye” to that habit boosted my focus:

- **Time Suck:** I was spending *hours* flicking through feeds instead of getting things done. One second I’m scrolling, the next I’m deep-diving into cat videos from 2012. Like, what even?! 
- **Mental Clutter:** My mind was buzzing with irrelevant info (seriously, do I need to know what influencer wore what?), leaving zero space for actual productive thoughts.
- **FOMO:** Yup, that classic fear of missing out had me glued to my phone instead of living in the moment. What was happening in my life was way cooler than what was happening on my screen!

### So here’s what I did: 

1. **Set Boundaries:** I limited my social media check-ins to twice a day—morning coffee and after dinner. Sounds simple, but it was a game changer!
  
2. **Engagement Over Scrolling:** Instead of mindlessly scrolling, I started using that time to connect with friends or communities that uplifted me. Like, I’d rather support a friend’s new venture than see a post that makes me want to throw my phone out the window. 

3. **Focus Rituals:** I swapped that time for deep work sessions. I even bought a cute timer (yes, I’m that person) and used the Pomodoro technique. 25 minutes of focus, 5 minutes of scrolling—ha!

### And let me tell you, my productivity soared like a kite on a windy day! 🎏✨

I’m not saying you have to ditch social media entirely, but maybe there’s a habit you’ve got that’s doing the opposite of what you want? Whether it’s multitasking, binge-watching a series at the expense of actual sleep, or getting lost in it all—share some of your thoughts! 

How have you managed to clear out the clutter and reclaim your focus? Let’s swap stories and keep this convo going! 💬👇

Quick update because many of you told me to stay silent and let it blow up on their end, and surprise!The bomb is now officially going off.

Context: MIL has been boundary-stomping and guilt-tripping for months. She gave a non-apology, kept pushing for visits with LO, and acted like me giving birth was something she was entitled to front-row seats for. I’ve stayed silent and SO has handled communication. And despite multiple calm, honest conversations, the IL’s have continued to ignore the root issue.

Well… this morning SO let them know he wouldn’t be coming over for a quick visit like he planned  (LO had a rough teething night and we got like zero sleep), and the emotional fallout began.

Here’s the message from FIL to SO:

“SO I love you guys very much but I can't tell you how disappointed I am. Your Mom who would do anything for you, has been though a shit ton of pain both physically and emotionally this year. MIL has NOT done anything to deserve this treatment. You can't even come over to pick up Christmas presents for our grandchild. WHAT did we do to deserve this treatment. You and OP have totally cut your selves out from your families. We deserve real explanation. What would you do if either one of you were really sick and needed help. You have families that you just closing off. Did we do anything in your childhood to deserve this treatment. Talk to me Father to son or Man to Man.”

Also MIL sent this to SO:

“Do you want us to come over there to help with LO? You all could rest.
I can still hold a teething baby and not get upset
Babies are supposed to cry when they don't feel good.
I love you guys, too
I never thought you and OP would treat us this way. You both know how much I love babies”

Funny enough, this is the same man who cried in front of SO a few months ago saying he felt terrible about how I was treated and wanted to apologize in person. Apparently that empathy expired.

So yeah… I’m not saying I’m thrilled to be proven right, but I am saying thank you to everyone who told me to hold the line. Their own behavior is doing the talking now and they don’t like what it’s saying.

I’ll keep you all posted. For now, I’ll be over here drinking my coffee with a front-row seat to the meltdown.

1jyiyro,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jyiyro/advice_from_a_postpartum_mom_the_first_poop/,Advice from a postpartum mom. (The first poop),"The first poop can sometimes sound daunting, but as a FTM who is recently postpartum, I decided to hop on here and offer some advice for fellow FTM who may be pregnant and scared of the idea of the first poop. 

1. They may give you a stool softener in the hospital. Take it, and buy some for afterwards. Stay on the stool softener for a few weeks. I got ducolax and it worked. 

2. The poop may take several days. Do not be alarmed. I do not know why it happens, but it happens. The hospital told me it was hormonal. 

3. Drink coffee. I drank 3 iced coffees in the 5 days leading up to my poop. I truly believed that it helped the process along. My OBGYN informed me that I could have up to 300mg of caffeine daily while breastfeeding and that I only had to stick loosely to that number.

4. Do not push the poop out. Wait for it to build and just sort of relax your muscles and let it fall out. It may scare you, but do not tense up at all. Do not be afraid to get back up and wait a little longer to poop.   

5. Peri bottle with warm water to the area after you finish, and wipe with baby wipes. Do not use toilet paper. I repeat, DO NOT USE TOILET PAPER.  

I had no problems with the pospartum poops. I only had a first degree tear, so I was lucky.

If you had a vaginal delivery (even medicated), just try to remember that you pushed a human out of you. This little bowel movement will be nothing to you. 

If you had a C section, you just got sliced open and had a baby scooped out of your insides. This bowel movement will be nothing to you.

She sleeps 90% of the day, fully house trained, zero separation anxiety and doesn’t destroy things. We can even leave human food around her and she won’t go for it. She happily bounces around our yard and only “plays” maybe 5-10 minutes a day total when the only dog in the house. She cuddles happily and is super sweet and so tolerant and gentle with all our cat, kitten, dog and kitten fosters. But she loves dog play dates and is too shy to go on leash walks, although she will for a short walk if she knows and likes the other dog. We have wanted a second dog that we can take on walks, hang at the local breweries or coffee shop or take to the lake. We would also hope the second dog would enjoy the sporadic play with our dog, cuddles, short walks 2-3 times a day and fit in with our lifestyle of just chilling on the couch. 


The reason why we are debating not adopting anymore is we have had 3 temp fosters in the last month that were perfect on paper so if they fit we would have adopted them. The issue is being perfect on paper doesn’t seem to be the truth all the time. Foster 1 was wonderful 9/10 but wouldn’t walk on a leash at all. Foster 2 was 9/10 and was perfect in all areas except when seeing our cats through a play gate had an instant prey switch where she clearly wanted to eat them. (We have two cats that are independent, one being elderly). She was said to be good with cats, turns out they had just assumed she was since otherwise she was such a chill dog. Foster 3 was great with cats, but was the furthest thing from “gentle, calm, sleepy” as she was described. She was very high energy and only knew how to play but forceful biting humans hard and then aggressive humping people. She cared not for playing with our dog or toys. 


The point I guess is I was wondering if you all had advice or opinions? Is a sweet, non reactive/no sep anxiety, fully house trained, loves dogs and cats, that is happy to hang on a couch most of the day unattainable? I know we are looking for a very specific special dog but when we finally find a perfect fit on paper, it seems the description was embellished or bent. Yesterday I was like okay guess a second dog isn’t in the cards for us but then today I saw a dog I really wanted to meet two months ago who I was obsessed with that got was adopted out was back at the rescue. I never stopped thinking about her and now she is back and ready to be adopted it. The issue is her rescue doesn’t do temp fosters or foster to adopt so we can only believe her description which we are hesitant about. Should we just call the search off at this point? Should we give her a shot? Is what we want absurd? ",0,1744580717.0,dogs,12,0.38,False

Hi there! I’m a 50-year-old woman who’s lived, loved, learned, and still believes the best is yet to come. Life has taught me to cherish laughter, value honesty, and find joy in both the big and small things. I’m at a stage in my life where I know who I am, what I want, and what I simply won't settle for and I find that incredibly empowering.

I’m not here chasing perfection or fairy tales, but I do believe in genuine connections.those rare, magnetic moments when conversation flows effortlessly, time seems to slow down, and something just clicks. I’m drawn to kindness, emotional intelligence, a good sense of humor, and people who are still curious about life. Someone who’s been through a few storms, come out stronger, and is still open to love that’s my kind of person.

I enjoy meaningful conversations just as much as quiet moments. Whether it's a walk in nature, a good book, music that moves the soul, or just sipping coffee and sharing stories, I believe connection can be found in the simplest of moments.

If you're emotionally available, ready to explore what a deep connection can look like at this stage in life, and appreciate a woman who knows her worth, then I’d love to hear from you.

Came back that same night, saw about 4-5 nymphs the same size as the other one I had seen. All of them around the vicinity of the dishwasher. Even saw one on the dishwasher handle. 
I came back two days later to let the maintenance man in to spray poison and lay down MaxForce bait in the kitchen, bathroom and laundry room. Shortly after that, still saw nothing except for one nymph, maybe slightly bigger than the others I had seen, but also maybe not? And it was in the bathroom sink (I had ran the sink for the first time to make my baby a bottle) it seemed to be going for the water. 

I am going back tonight to finish up some things and take another look. assuming I don’t see any adults still, and only see babies, what type of infestation do you think i’m looking at?

Part One.

Ada, fifteen years old, she of purple hair and ripped long unwashed jeans, made her lonely way through the throngs of Thursday night commuters. Traffic signs and lighted storefronts bled into the gathering twilight. An orchestra of honking car horns and emergency vehicle sirens flooded her ears. 
Ada was living on the streets for almost a week now. 
The first night on her own was the hardest. As the night claimed the city, Ada huddled deeper into the doorway. All the comfort she had was the thin cardboard box and a sweater she found in a bin behind the department store. 
Hunger and thirst kept her company, but she was too afraid to leave her hideaway. The dark streets and shadowy alleys scared Ada immensely.
Ada’s day started like any other day, but then came the Fight. Ada’s mom and Ada screamed and screamed some more at each other about the boy that Ada’s mother did not like and Ada was crazy about.
The screaming stopped when Ada slammed the front door behind her and stormed out, vowing never to return to this house again.
When the anger had evaporated, the loneliness and fear stepped in and rocked the runaway’s world. 
The days that followed were an endless sequence of scary situations, dangerous or just crazy strangers, search for food and shelter. The nights were always the worst. 
The city, careless and confusing labyrinth full of noise, weird smells, rushing cars and the always-present danger. 
Ada clung to the little keychain of Minnie Mouse, she got at Disney World, which now represented the life she might never get back again.
One afternoon, an old bum, who was kind to Ada,  gave her a library card no longer needed by his friend who passed away.
The heavy wooden doors groaned as Ada entered, as a wave of cool, dusty air smelling like aging paper and leather bindings washed over the girl.
Light strained its way through dusty windows, casting tiny shapes  of color onto the old wooden floor. Bookshelves crammed into every nook and cranny, lined the walls. 
The air itself was whispers that seemed to come from the ceiling or ooze from the wall. Every time Ada would turn, she would realize that nobody was speaking. After some time she got used to the strangeness of the place.
A lonely figure of a librarian, silver hair in a tight bun, haunted a ship of a desk in the front. Her gaze warned unwary into the silence of glaciers amid the calm of tidal pools. Librarian’s eyes were full with  the promise of knowledge contained in every tome lining the oaken shelves
The silence, broken only by the occasional cough or the soft lament of a turning page, felt like heaven to Ada.
The library became her refuge from the life outside. The library card belonging to a dead man allowed unhappy teen to submerge herself in the worlds of imagination. She picked books that transported her to faraway lands and realities far away from her own. 
Ada devoured Jordan and traveled with the Dragon Reborn, Sanderson took her into the city of gods Elantris.  She discovered Simak and entered his Goblin Reservation. Harrison’s Stainless Steel Rat had her back on a tour of Galaxy. 
Ada survived on her own for a week now, but today something bad happened. First she realized that she somehow lost her library card. As if this was not awful enough, a really creepy dude started following her.
As she was walking through a tiny park in the middle of the city, more like an isle of grass with a few forlorn trees, Ada was completely miserable trying to figure out where she lost the library card. 
Suddenly she snapped out of her reverie, because she got a bad feeling all of a sudden. Ada looked around and noticed a slick looking guy in a leather vest sitting on a bench under a tree. The guy was looking at her and smiling. Ada really did not like this smile. This predatory toothy grin scared the living lights out of her. The guy got up and said something. Ada turned around and started walking really fast.
It started raining and cobblestones , slick with rainwater crunched under her well worn sneakers. The air grew heavy, the loud voice of the city was suddenly replaced by an unsettling silence. The creepy dude was rapidly gaining on her and the alley she stepped into looked like a dead end now.
Ada panicked and ran forward. The heavy silence was broken now by the sound her sneakers were making and the clicking scuffing sound of the cowboy boots of her pursuer.
-There is no way for you out of this, babe- he called out
-Except with me. I’ll take good care of you, if you do all I tell you to do- he taunted Ada.
-There is a mattress with your name on it, once you start working for me- he promised darkly to her retreating back.
Suddenly, a glint of gold caught her eye. The darkness receded and she saw a small, ornately carved wooden door slightly ajar to the left of her. Ada grabbed for the door, opened it and dove through, in what seemed like a single motion. Her pursuer howled in anger as the door suddenly shut in front of him. 
Ada turned around trying to bar the door to keep him out. But there was no need to worry. The door was gone. The awful stinky alley was gone. 
Ada was standing in the middle of a square. As she was trying to catch her breath, the girl looked down and saw the cobblestones under her feet. But these were not regular old cobblestones. These stones were really ancient looking. Worn smooth by centuries of busy footsteps, they shimmered faintly in the light of antique looking street lamps filtering down from just above her head.
The buildings lining the square seemed to lean conspiratorially towards the girl , as if trying to whisper something into her ear. Vines were creeping up veiny stone walls, cascading over wrought-iron balconies drawn in shades of emerald and gold. Flower boxes on the window sills were overflowing with sweet smelling flowers. 
The square was completely deserted. 
Ada walked uncertainly forward, when she noticed a tiny cafe tucked discreetly between two dark and permanent looking mansions. There was light inside and a cat sitting on a doorstep. As she edged around the cat, the creature did not move, except to turn its head to follow the girl. There was a gentle murmur of conversation that died down as Ada entered. Her stomach murmured loudly complaining. Last time she ate seemed like forever and Ada suddenly felt lightheaded. She grabbed for the counter and would have fallen, if not for strong hands that grabbed hold of her. Disoriented she was led into a cozy booth. As she sat down, a cup of coffee was placed in front of her. As she grabbed for it, smelling coffee’s rich aroma with a hint of caramel and spice, a small delicate plate was put  in front of the girl. Chocolate glistened on top of a dome of scone that smelled like it was baked just moments ago. Tiny petals of chocolate formed a gentle flower around the dome of a desert. As Ada reached for the desert she smelled warm cinnamon. The smell of cinnamon increased as a tall woman wearing an apron decorated with whimsically drawn cat playing a fiddle, sat down across from Ada.

- Welcome to Cat and the Fiddle Cafe - she greeted Ada.
As she smiled, the smell of cinnamon became almost overpowering, then receded to remain as just a hint in the background of their conversation. 

- Thank you for the food - mumbled Ada, her mouth full of wonderful treat. 
She took a sip of coffee and sighed with pleasure.
- I’ve never tasted anything better. But I have absolutely no money- her voice dropped. 
She looked at the woman with desperation. 
- No payment is required, my dear. - said the woman still smiling. 
- I am the owner of this little cafe and I can afford to treat one of my guests anytime I feel like it. And you looked like you needed something to keep you from fainting right in the middle of my cafe- she grinned and winked at Ada.
- I did - Ada sighed contentedly having finished with her treat.
Then a thought came to mind and the girl rapidly fired what she just thought about.
- But where am I. What is this place? How did I get here? Why?-
The woman smiled and folded her long hands on the table. The smell of cinnamon became stronger again. 
- Just around the corner from the world you know. You always feel us, but don’t know we are there. 
- But you are too tired right now for this conversation. Too many emotions could be overwhelming if experienced at the same time.
- Now get some rest and we’ll talk more at a later point. Just walk down the street, until you see hotel Troll Station. Can’t miss it Ada, dear. And yes if you are looking for me, ask for Annabelle.- with this, the cafe proprietor rose and walked away, taking the cinnamon smell away with her.
Ada rose and walked out of the coffee shop still feeling she was in the middle of a dream. 
- How did she know my name? What is this place?- but she was too tired to worry much longer. 
After walking for a few more seconds she noticed the hotel. It was built out of the same veiny stone like every building around here. Its facade was swimming in a warm, golden light that seemed to come from the stones themselves. A tasteful awning stated in elegant lettering, ""The Troll Station."" 
Following the dream logic Ada cautiously pushed open the doors of the establishment. She couldn’t say what she expected to find inside. 
The lobby was a study in elegance and luxury. 
Ada stepped onto a plush golden rug and walked towards a mahogany desk situated at the end of a long room. She noticed a crystal chandelier gleaming with warm light over her head. An ornate clock in a dark walnut frame carved with figures of flying birds and stalking animals chimed out its silent melody. 
Behind the desk sat the most curious looking man, that she had ever seen.
He was very short in stature, but Ada gasped as she noticed that his shadow thrown by the chandelier was impossibly tall and gaunt. The shadow seemed to be nearly indistinct one moment and almost corporeal the next. He had a smallish head with an impossibly large piercing pair of blue eyes, deep and intense. All that Ada could see of his attire visible above the desk, was a velvet cloak on top of a waistcoat. 
His bony fingers with yellowish nails rested on top of a desk. There was an old fashioned cane with a head carved into the likeness of an owl, leaning against a desk. 
- Mr Besk is my name, young lady. I presume you are looking for an accommodation? - his smile appeared, then dissipated with a mention of an accommodation, then reappeared again. 
Mr Besk’s mouth was full of sharp teeth. Ordinarily Ada would find his appearance troublesome. Today she was too tired to feel afraid any longer. 
- I would like a room, but I don’t have any money. Annabelle said..” she started haltingly, but then stopped realizing how what she was about to say, would sound.
Mr Becks nodded as if everything was answered satisfactorily. He rubbed his hands and pulled out a large leather-bound book seemingly out of the thin air. 
- No payment is necessary, if Ms Annabelle herself vouched for you. Would a room with a view on  our beautiful square be satisfactory?- he beamed at the girl
She nodded mutely. Next moment Mr Becks produced a key and directed Ada to the room on the 3rd floor. 
As she entered the room, Ada reflected upon the difference between her current arrangement and back alleys she had to sleep in for the last week. 
The room was perfect. Curtains were open and light filtered through a single, diamond-paned window, illuminating fantastical shapes upon the fluffy carpet. A large bed took up most of the space in the room. There was still enough room left for a bookshelf and a small writing table by the window. The bookshelf was overflowing with leather-bound tomes, whose titles drew her instantly and left spellbound. She never heard of these books. Here was a volume of James P. Blaylock in her favorite Balumnia series, which she never read before. It was called Mad Goblin’s Treasure. Eagerly she picked up a hefty volume and put it on the bed. She looked over H.P. Lovecraft’s “Diary of the Shoggoth War”, Simak SciFi novel “The Ocean of Time”, Robert Jordan’s standalone in the world of the Wheel of Time, called “ The Crown of Asha'man”. The bookshelf was stuffed with the books she never heard about. 
An armchair next to the bookshelf with its plush cushions drew her forward. She sat down for a second, holding her Blaylock book and read about 50 pages, before she regretfully put down the book, closed the curtains and got into bed.
Warm sunlight filtering through the curtains woke Ada up. As we walked down the stairs towards the lobby, an aroma of woodsmoke and spice lingered in the air. 
Mr Becks was still up and politely directed Ada to a breakfast buffet laid out in the next room. The feast laid out on the table seemed like a scene from a forgotten fairy tale.
The room was full of guests happily munching and drinking from large steaming cups of coffee or fragrant teas. Buffet table was full of platters of smoked meats and cheeses from creamy French Brie to gentle fresh mozarella , green and black olives, grilled asparagus, omelettes and bagels with smoked salmon.
A chef was carving steaming lamb and juicy steak. There were pancakes and muffins, donuts and pies, orange and pomegranate juice, fruits and berries.
Ada picked up a plate and piled it up with food. While she was gorging herself, she was blind to an outside world. When her hunger receded, she was able to finally look around and notice those who were sharing the meal with her. 
There were exquisite men in tailored suits, and rugged adventurer types in fedoras and worn leather jackets, women were wearing elaborate gowns and large hats. Some people were dressed just like her, in modern clothes. While eating they were all engaged in animated conversation and often filled the room with booms and tinkles of laughter..
Ada stumbled into the strange man a dozen steps out of Troll Station. She was walking around the square, looking around and trying to figure out what to do next. As Ada examined a tall tower with a clock, situated between two houses, she ran into the man, almost falling to the ground from the impact. For a second it felt as if Ada ran head on into the brick wall.
He was extremely tall and reedy, with a tangled salt and pepper beard. The stranger had on a shimmering coat and grey leather boots. He was not upset with Ada. His eyes were full of laughter as he winked at her.
- I am so sorry- Ada stammered- I just came here- the words just spilled out of her. 
He grinned and nodded without saying a word. 
- Can you talk? - Ada asked 
- Depends upon who I am talking to. They must be worthy. Are you worthy? - he grinned again.

I think splitting it into 2 seating areas, maybe 2 chairs/small loveseat on either side of the fireplace with small coffee table, and then larger sofa and loveseat in the back where the staged couch is now. But open to hear what you have to say and any help/opinions is great appreciated.

I've done my best to research everything I can about the island, but I'd love some feedback to make our precious 5 days there even better!

For context, we're big hikers, snorkelers, and nature-lovers. We're not big on shopping, crowds, or fancy restaurants. We'll likely make simple meals/picnic most nights, but we love poke and Mexican food and hope to hit a few markets/food trucks along the way. We're looking to see as much as we can while still building in some time to rest and enjoy our surroundings (based in Princeville).

Here's what I've got so far:

**Wednesday**

* Arrive late afternoon, drive to Princeville AirBnb
* Stop at **Pono Market** or **Kilauea Fish Market** for takeout picnic dinner

**Thursday**

* Breakfast at Hanalei Bread Co. or Holey Grail Donuts
* Spend time hanging out at **Hanalei Bay**
* Snorkel at **Hideaway Beach** in Princeville or **Tunnels Beach** if we get lucky and can snag parking
* **Sandwich Isle** or **Dolphin Fish Market** for picnic dinner 
* **Queen’s Bath** for sunset?

**Friday**

* 7 a.m. Hanalei Charters boat tour of the Napali Coast
* Spend the afternoon at either **Hideaway Beach** or **Tunnels beach**, depending on what happens the day before
* Consider checking for parking at **Limahuli Gardens** or doing a nearby hike if above two options don't work out
* Make dinner at AirBnb

**Saturday**

* Hike to **Hanakapiai Falls** (entrance and shuttle pass secured)
* On the way back, change and enjoy **Ke’e Beach**
* Dinner at AirBnb 
   * Poke from Foodland?
   * Paco's Tacos picnic in Kilauea?

**Sunday**

* Breakfast/coffee at Java Kai
* Hike **Makaleha Falls** or kayak the **Wailua River** (we're leaning toward the hike since we think the waterfall looks cooler there, but is the experience of being on the river something not to miss?)
* Lunch at Kapa’a food trucks 
   * El Rey Day Mar (fish tacos)
   * Wailua Shave Ice
* Stop at [Kilauea Fish Market](https://www.kilaueafishmarket.com/) for takeout dinner on way back?
* Stop at **Anini Beach** for snorkeling on the way back?
* Go to night market in Princeville 

**Monday**

* Breakfast at **Nourish Hanalei**
* Stop at **Hanalei Valley Lookout**
* **NEED AN IDEA FOR WHAT TO DO HIKING/BEACH-WISE this day!!**
* Dinner at Hanalei Poke Co

**Tuesday**

* 8 a.m. leave Princeville for Waimea Canyon State Park
   * Take Waimea Canyon Road (Highway 550) to get in (more scenic)
   * First stop should be Waimea Canyon Lookout (mile marker 10)
   * Second stop should be Puʻu Hinahina Lookout (mile marker 13.5)
   * Third stop should be Puʻu o Kila (mile marker 19)
   * Hike: **Pihea Vista Trail** OR **Awa'awapuhi Trail** (which is better?)

1jyikec,https://i.redd.it/j24ru4877oue1.jpeg,Camo kitty,"This is my baby girl loving the outdoors where first found her. Moved to my grandparents farm in the blue ridge mountains in southern VA near border of NC. I arrived in may 2023 or so ano had been getting used to my new place and that's when she came to me. Out of no where she came out of the woods meowing super loud almost asking me for help so of course I got her some food and water. She would be around but wouldn't come anywhere near me and then boom she was gone and I didn't see her for months and I had some health issues which kept me inside and I didn't see her for awhile and I wasn't able to put food outside even though possums raccoons and what not would eat it pretty fast anyway. Fast forward to next spring and boom sure enough there she was. This time I was determined to make her feel comfortable so I put food and water out again and I would sit patiently at the end of the deck trying to get her to come near. She was very skiddish and wasn't trusting but after a few weeks of dedication I FINALLY got her to come near me and she allowed me to pet her. Since then she's been with me every single day. I took her to the vet and come to find out she's been spayed so someone had her before me but the vet who's a family friend said she's has the softest coat he's ever felt and I said I do feed her wet food daily and lots of spoils.
Said prob only a couple years old. I thought getting her to come up to me was hard but introducing her to inside was the hardest especially when it was cold outside. She wouldn't dare come inside unless the door stayed open which is hard to do in the winter. So I bought her a little cat house with a heating pad and she absolutely loved it! Infact even during this spring cuz the weather has been unusually cold she was still using it to keep warm. It's funny when I first moved here there was a mouse and pest problem but since she showed up there hasn't been a single mouse inside the house and she's caught countless amounts always showing me her trophies and or presents lol. Now that I will leave the deck door open she comes in all the time whenever she wants and is totally comfortable in the den part of the house. Every day when I wake up I will go outside refill her food open the door make myself coffee sit down on the couch and wake up. Sure enough after she's done eating she will come in and hop up on the couch with me and rub against my legs. The first time she did that I felt a profound feeling of love. I've never really been a cat person but I truly believe she came to me for a reason. live on 42 acres with a creek running through it and anytime I go walking around the property day or night she's right there by my side. I was worried when I fell ill it was around September of that same year I moved here and I couldn't help but worry about her being in the cold. However since all of that she’s doing great the picture is from today just a little bit ago she’s so cute and has this quirky personality but the crazy thing is she still prefers it outside completely. She has fallen asleep inside one time but for the most part she will sleep right outside on the deck on this big fluffy comforter I put there. I’ve always been someone who tries not to get attached to things living or not. When my Lhasa opso died in my arms after having her for close to two decades in 2021 I never wanted to feel that sort of pain again. People have asked when I was going to get a new dog and what not and I would always say I’m not ready but that’s when this little precious girl found me. I’ve never officially named her or anything I just call her kitty girl  but idk I thought yall would like hearing this story.",4,1744579727.0,cats,0,0.83,False

i dont know who this person is but they added me on discord asking if i’d be their platonic sugar baby. 500 per week for conversations. that sounds too good to be true, i’ve been joking saying this sounds like a scam but have been reassured its not. they’ve told me their preferred clothing brands to buy from and hobbies they like. they moved from Texas to Canada (where i live however not the same province). 
At first they messaged me once per 24 hours and since today have been having whole conversations with me. we talked about hobbies and what kind of jobs we have etc. I’ve never been a sugar baby before so i dont know anything and make that clear. They’re calling me dear and reassuring i don’t need to worry about money with them. When i asked why they added me they said bc my discord was interesting looking and funny, they stuck around because they think i’m cool. i’ve never sent personal info or photos of anything related to me. they only have my discord. 
Essentially this sounds very scammy but i also don’t want to pass this up bc while i wouldn’t mind being a sugar baby i’m not the most desirable in the bowl (i’m not a woman). They said they will send me a little surprise to prove they arent a scam but I don’t have cash app or venmo or paypal or whatever so i dont know how safe those programs are and how to watch out for scams that involve a scammer paying me (if thats possible). 
While they said its fine that i want to look further into cashapp or paypal, they also mentioned mobile checks are super easy and that was the last straw for me. so im posting here.

A true story 
By Greezy Keith 
-For those of you who believe that Human Beings are creatures of free will, please take a trip with me back in time... while in a dream I saw a glimpse of my future, and no matter how hard I tried to avoid it, I ended up causing it to happen.

When I was just a 12 year old boy, before the advent of cell phones, streaming media, or even the internet for that matter, I didn’t know much about the paranormal and things of that nature. No, my biggest pursuits we're comic books, collecting Hot Wheels cars, and supporting my video game addiction over at the local arcade.

So I got this little weekend job down at the swap meet helping out this old Chinese vendor named Chung. The job was simple; meet Chung at the drive-in theater early Saturday morning to help set up his vending spot with merchandise consisting of knock-off Gucci bags, pocketbooks, and assorted women’s shoes, then assisting him throughout the day. At the end of the day Chung would hand me a nice crispy $10.00 bill. I was making $20 a week, which in 1978 afforded me the latest issues of Mad Magazine and collectible Hot Wheels, as well as a shot at this new video game over at the arcade called ‘Space Invaders’.

On one Friday night I sat on the edge of my bed, reached over and picked up my little alarm clock to set it for work the next morning. Swap meet vendors had to be there early so that they could set up and be ready to meet the throngs of shoppers coming in at 7:30 when the ticket gates opened.

My alarm clock was an old vintage wind-up handed down to me from my grandmother. It had a round face and two little bells on top that would ring when the hour hand reached the third hand, also known as the ‘alarm hand’. I set the alarm hand for 5:30, wound the clock spring, and placed it back on my nightstand. I prided myself on being on time…a characteristic that was instilled in me from the time I learned to work for my own money. I was a young man of morals and integrity. I had the world by the horns… or so I thought.

I put my pajamas on and laid my work clothes out on a chair, then tucked myself in for the night. I must have slept extremely well that night. We’re talking deep R.E.M. sleep. Time seemed to no longer exist. Then I had a very lucid dream. It went something like this:

I’m walking through a door, and there, about 30 to 35 feet in front of me was my boss, Chung, squatting down in front of his vendors stall that was completely set up, with purses and handbags hanging from hooks on the shade structure, and tables festooned with colorful tablecloths, loaded with pocketbooks, coin purses and other accessories. He was straightening a pair of red shoes he had arranged on the tarmac. 

I had missed setup. I was suddenly flushed with the realization that I was late for work. That feeling of pure anxiety washed over me like a bucket of ice cold water.

I stood frozen and speechless as Chung looked over his shoulder and spotted me. He nodded his head with a grin and started to speak. But the sound that came out was not that of his voice, but a loud, steady ringing sound like a bell.

Suddenly I was ripped from my dream, and I bolted upright in bed to the sound of my alarm clock going off. It was 5:30 and time to get ready for work. I reached over and turned it off, then rubbed my eyes, anxious with that feeling of being late that lingered with repeating visions from that stupid dream. 

I felt like I had just closed my eyes only to be rudely awakened again. I shrugged it off and went to the bathroom to begin my morning ritual for work. 

But the dream kept replaying itself over and over in my head like a 10-second video clip stuck on a loop. The finished displays. The red shoes. The grin on Chung's face. The feeling of being late. I just couldn’t shake it despite the fact that I had gotten up on time and there was nothing standing in the way of me being on time for work that morning. 

Nonetheless, I picked up my pace a little bit just to make sure that dream playing out over and over again, and that feeling of dread that comes with showing up late for work, would just go away.

I felt a bit silly as I donned my clothes a little quicker, and tied my old suede wallabies a little faster than I normally would. “This is ludicrous”, I thought to myself. “There's no way I can be late. If anything, I’ll be super early.”

I cut the time I would normally spend getting ready to go to work in half by skipping breakfast, and set out on foot at 6:00 in the chilly morning darkness toward the drive-in theater that waited for me about a block and a half away from my house. 

The light of dawn wouldn't break for another half-hour or so. And, as it has been all season, my job was to show up around 7:00 a.m., meet Chung at our usual spot, and we would knockout the setup by 7:30…just in time for the shoppers to be allowed in. But this time it would be “a little bit different” I thought to myself as I shuffled down my empty street toward the quiet main thoroughfare.  

Ignoring the crosswalk, I jogged across the four lane thoroughfare toward the main gate of the drive-in theater with its landmark screen towering in the distance. The dream quickened my pace. I scoffed, and fought the urge to break into a run. 

It was unusually foggy that morning too, as the street lamps created a halo of swirling mist that struck my imagination as some ominous interdimensional portal. 

And that damn dream. That dream was still fresh on my mind as I entered the gate and waved at the security guard leaning in the door frame of his guard shack. he recognized me with a nod of his head, his face half-lit by one single incandescent light bulb from within. He pulled the cigarette from his lips with thumb and forefinger and let out a puff of thick, gray smoke. “Here a little early, arencha?” 

I shook my head and shoved my hands in my pockets as I thought about how ridiculous it was for me to be here at this hour. There was literally no one there except for the snack bar/cafe crew in the center of the drive-in lot. I headed straight for it. I needed to get my head on straight. I needed a cup of coffee and an old-fashioned glazed donut. 

I walked into the cafe and up to the service counter. The place was completely empty  except for the bleary-eyed workers who were busy doing their morning prep for the coming rush of customers. “their day starts a lot earlier than mine”, I reckoned as I took in the aroma of fresh coffee and baked donuts. 

I ordered my cup of coffee and an old-fashioned glazed with a $2 bill and got two quarters change. I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into the comfort that old timeless favorite would bring me.

Through large windows I could see a panoramic view of the outside area. I spotted a booth and sat down from where I could have my eyes on our nearby spot unobstructed so that when Chung arrived I would see him and go out to greet him early.

I felt so foolish as I stirred the sugar and powdered creamer in, and chuckled to myself as the dream faded, my senses now preoccupied by the taste of fresh coffee and the flavor of that old fashioned glazed delicacy. 


 About halfway through my cup of coffee I glanced at my watch. It was 7:00-about the time I would normally show up, and the vendors were rapidly arriving en masse, claiming their spots, the clinking and clanking of their shade structure poles reverberated throughout the drive-thru as the they got busy unloading their vehicles and setting up their vending stalls. 

I stared blankly at our spot. Empty. That’s strange. No Chung. Something was not right. The spaces on both sides we're already busy with vendors and their helpers skilfully fastening leg poles to corner pieces, and stretching canvas tarps with bungee cords for shade.

I stepped outside to use the payphone that was mounted on the wall next to the restrooms. I figured I'd call Chung at home to see if he was there. But the pay phone was out of order. 

By now the light of dawn was just beginning to illuminate the cloudless sky, and the fog that had invaded the early morning was gone. And so was Chung. I played with my empty coffee cup and considered a second round. “Why not?” If Chung didn’t show up by the time I finished the second cup, I reasoned, then I guess he would be considered a no-show. 

Heck, I could just go home and crawl back into bed for a couple more hours before the rest of my family started to rouse. Godzilla and Kung Fu reruns on Saturday morning. Yes, just what the doctor ordered. 

Sitting back down at my booth with a fresh hot cup of coffee on my last 50 cents, I looked over to our spot again. It was completely vacant, with occupants on either side busily arranging their goods for display for the shoppers that would soon be flooding in. 

There were folding tables beneath the shade structures displaying everything from fashion and underwear to car stereos and children's toys. A sea of shade structures, tarps, goods, with cargo vans, box trucks, and just about anything you could haul stuff in had materialized across the tarmac of the drive-in theater as far as the eye could see. 

If you’ve ever been to a swap meet you know what I'm talking about. It was now 7:30. It was Showtime!

“Well, I guess that's it”, I thought to myself as I stood up and drank the last sip from my coffee cup. That whole dream was such a... well, it was just that…a dream. I was now free to go home and catch some shut eye, and to decompress from an otherwise stressful episode.

I headed for the exit on the other side of the cafe. Beyond it was my home less than a couple blocks away. Through the windows on that side I could see the shoppers starting to flow in from the ticket line and fan out through the isles of waiting vendors. I grabbed the doorknob and pushed it outward, and then I felt a strange rush kind of like ‘Déjà vu’ come over me. 

“This can’t be…”, I struggled to reason, as I walked out the door and saw…him. I was back in that damn dream! …And I was late!

I gazed in existential horror at Chung who squatted about 35 feet right in front of me. He was straightening a pair of brightly polished red pumps on display on the tarmac.

My jaw went slack as my coffee cup fell from numb fingers. “Chung?”

Chung looked over his shoulder in my direction. He had just finished setting up his stall. Every detail was there from the hanging handbags to the accessory tables and brightly colored tablecloths.

His eyes met mine, then he said with a sheepish grin; “Oh there you are! I forgot to tell you last weekend…I switched spots.”

1jyie1x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jyie1x,The Amazing Spider-Man 3 should be a love story!,"We’ve all had our idea of what TASM3 should or could be. For years it was Venom and Andrew’s Peter in the black suit. Perhaps maybe the Sin Eater. That would be fun. Maybe Spider-Gwen in a crazy multiverse or this Peter meeting and training the next Spider-Man, Miles Morales. All these ideas have merit and major upside but for me non have truly clicked with me especially where No Way Home left off.

My idea would be a love story, a story about trying to fall back in love. How difficult must it be to love someone new when you haven’t had the chance to fall out of love with the person you considered your soulmate. That’s a real human story and would fit Spider-Man and this Peter PERFECTLY. It’s a story between Peter Parker and Mary Jane and why those two are perfect for each other and how scary it is to love again. We see this through not just them but Aunt May and Doc Ock. A cheesy silver age idea but one that could be really crucial. It shows Peter you can love again and move on but not moving away from who you once loved. But also, it’s his Aunt moving on from his best friend and uncle and this new man will be the villain of this film so it’s bit of a tainted picture for Pete.

Peter is a science teacher at Empire State University and Mary Jane works just down the road at the Coffee Bean, trying to start up fresh in New York after moving in with her aunt after leaving New Jersey. 

Comics I think suit this would be elements of Taylor’s FNH Spider-Man (especially with Nathan), JMS’ teacher role for Peter, Parallel Lives (where we dive into Mary Jane’s backstory) and Spider-Man Blue with its first person narration and Peter’s love for Gwen being the beating heart.

We do see Gwen in this film but in a dream sequence. I feel having her be in it from the multiverse undermines her death but it being a dream keeps that death permanent but also gives us the last bit Peter needs to move on and move forward. Think the Uncle Ben and Peter scene from Spider-Man 2 but more optimistic and romantic. 

I wrote a full script about this which you can read below and I hope you enjoy it. It explores these characters and takes elements you’ve seen from comics and movies with a little twist to keep you on your toes. I’m really proud of it, I love Spider-Man and screenwriting so I hope this is something you can enjoy and imagine when relaxing.

1jyibdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandalsResorts/comments/1jyibdt/dunn_rivers_sandals_resort_review/,Dunn rivers sandals resort review.,"We recently returned from sandals Dunn river. If you have any qs, I’ll answer honestly. 

Pro

We had a beautiful Mammee room that faced the Riu. There was some noise we could hear inside our room but it did not bother us. The room is a garden view but really it was ocean view and so lovely. 

Housekeeping did a great job. They’re efficient and friendly. 

Our favorite restaurant was Banyu with Mr. King. It felt like he was welcoming us into his home! The food and service was outstanding. 

We loved pottery, tie dye, rum tasting, candle making, inter-tube pull, speciality drinks, and gift shop. Do all the fun things!

Crown jewel of this place is hands down, no doubt, Dominique the concierge. He is professional and friendly. Everything we asked for was provided quickly by him and his staff. We noticed him helping other departments, as well.  He is a rising leader and Sandals needs to hang onto him. He is always professional and aware of guests needs.  We saw him interacting with staff and guests and everyone loves him. He isn’t afraid to work, and we could see his dedication. If I were a company, I’d promote and retain him. 

Only a few hiccups-

\*Dwayne at saltaire is rude. He needs training/feedback. No one was at host stand for breakfast, the restaurant was half empty. We sat ourselves at a table for 4 as another couple was meeting us. He sd we didnt check w him and we couldn’t sit there. We told him another couple is joining us. We ordered coffee w him. He never brought it, 15 mins waited before getting it ourselves.

10 mins after seating, Dwayne condescending asked where the other couple was. We told him they’re on the way. My hubby also noticed how rude he was being. When the other couple arrived, he said to them “FINALLY!” 

\*We had a couples massage at Red Lane Spa on the property. We arrived early so we could enjoy the amenities, as Sandals resort policy is ALL guests can.  Staff sd they’d find us when it was time for our massages. The pool was closed. The sauna and steam room were closed. At our appointment time, I went to desk, since they hadn’t “found us” in this very small courtyard. They said “we were waiting for you”.  They gave us the forms. We didn’t get a tour, another guest showed me how to use the lockers and the robes.  All of this took time from our massage time! Frustrating since we arrived more than an hour before our appt.  

Being that we are returning Sandals guests,  we had a credit to use at the spa. The spa would not honor it.

We spoke with Nicola the spa manager.  She was defensive.  I don’t need to be trained on how the sandals rewards are or how the spa is 3rd party and not Sandals. Nicola TOLD ME  they don’t want non-service guests at the spa but that Sandals requires it. I told her she needs to negotiate that with sandals, and not a paying guest. It’s unprofessional for her to share this with a guest. I don’t work for sandals. She needs to vent to sandals about her frustrations. 

We’ve been to many luxury spas. Wynn, venetian red canyon, the trellis at the Houstonian.  They ALL are welcoming and luxurious with amazing facilities (OPEN pools/saunas/steam) with snacks and drinks and towels! Sandals red lane spa is sad and without the sandals property, they’d never be in business. Being that most guests are on vacation and aren’t consistent clients, this spa will survive. Red lane and Nicola need to be grateful to Sandals.

The tone of the spa is “they don’t want you here. “ and I wonder if this pool OR SUANA/steam is ever open or if the sign is always there saying the pool is closed. It’s not a hand written sign. It is a permanent, printed, mounted sign.

To all guests, the tone at the spa is they don’t want you there and especially if you aren’t a spa client (which we were). The tone matches exactly what Nicola said to me. 

The other “meh” is the returning guest dinner. The food was exceptional. And it’s fun to get to know other guests. But man, DUNNS GM, Deryk Meany, loves to talk about how great and important he is.  He talks WAY too much. Anyone that has to remind me of how important he is has an ego problem and isn’t that important. It’s off putting. Someone take away his mic. 

Will we return to dunns? Maybe. The drive is long (more than 2 hours when we arrived). the beach is not as beautiful as Negril for the same drive time. Mobay has the same beach and is much closer to airport. Though, Dunns restaurants are exceptional. Dominique is the factor in us revisiting dunns, over other locations. His attention to guests puts Dunns above other resorts. ",2,1744579068.0,SandalsResorts,1,1.0,False
1jyib80,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OrdinaryOlive3566/comments/1jyib80/just_venting_to_nowhere_and_to_noone/,just venting to nowhere and to no-one,"\[NOT A POLITICAL PAGE, literally just venting\]

I feel a sense of impending doom. Over politics and the current events. My train of thought here is very... Points A and B the connect further to Points C and D, even though they could've branched out to Points E and F and G.

I want to preface this by saying that ICE deporting thousands and thousands of people- many of which, to my knowledge, were here by legitimate means- was not the right thing to do and never was. The inhumane way in which so many innocent people are dragged from their homes is unacceptable.

To make matters worse, I keep hearing talk about this new bill that states you cannot vote if your name on your ID does not match your birth certificate or passport. It was very clearly targeted towards illegal immigrants, on paper, but the sheer number of people that this bill essentially fucks over extends well beyond the initial targeted demographic.

My patch of the internet has been full of people outraged (and rightfully so), about this bill because it would revoke the right to vote from so many women- particularly and especially married women (and even men who simply took their spouses last names, by the bill's logic- which could easily discriminate against gay men especially and other LGBTQ+ folks).

It's... poignant for me. The overturning of Roe V Wade was bad enough, but I was lucky to be in a blue state where the right to an abortion is protected. I have never needed to get one nor do I realistically foresee needing one- but what if something happened where I did? My right, in 100,000-odd square miles in an arbitrary section of the U.S., in protected. If lived in a different arbitrary area, I could be jailed or worse for even thinking about it. (Abortion is such a simple word for an unexpectedly complicated topic, by the way.)

With this new bill, which very well could be on a federal level rather than a state level, means that there is no safe zone. There is no arbitrary section of the United States where it is legal for me to exercise my right to vote. As my life stands right now, this bill does not affect me personally- but as I prepare for the next big step in my life, it easily could. It's... terrifying.

ABC News Australia, in a short clip, stated that ""roughly 69 million women, or 25% of eligible voters do not have IDs that match their birth certificates, usually because they changed their name when they got married."" I could be one of those 69 million. So easily. And so many are.

It's.. historically speaking, not the worst time to be a woman. I can maintain a level of independence today that even two or three generations ago, I might not have had. The thing is though, it could always be worse. It genuinely feels like so many pieces of America are making steps backward that women, as a collective, have fought so hard against. It feels like the Republican agenda, as far as women are concerned, is to go back the good ol' days where you could have your house and your wife who does everything you say (because she has no choice otherwise) and your 17 children. (and don't get me started- the Democratic party is no saint either. Like all media, they pick and choose what to tell and what not to show to viewers- but they're also not actively screwing over my demographic. It feels like I can't trust anything I see on the news- which is a WHOLE other rant).

I truly, truly think there's good in most everyone. Most people surely don't just wake up and go ""ah man my wife didn't bring me my coffee exactly on the dot, time to grab the wife-beating stick!"" Even if I were Republican, surely I wouldn't be like ""hm yes, I thoroughly enjoy not having a bank account or a driver's license. I love asking my husband for money and biking everywhere!"" Unless they actively wanted and consented to that lifestyle, no woman or person anywhere would enjoy that. (And yes, I am spit-balling extreme situations, but when things keep getting worse... and also, I'd bet my left tit on that situation being warped into somehow a positive thing).

Does anyone else remember the egg apron incident? This woman, Hannah, had an incredibly promising future as a ballerina- she was even planning on going to Julliard, which I understand to be an incredibly prestigious school. She wound up marrying a billionaire (their romance story, if that's what you can call it, was.... really creepy to me) and starting a farm and having kids, the whole song and dance. And... that's fine in theory. People make their own decisions, change paths. Sometimes you just decide to do what you want. And, if beneath all the controversy, she's truly satisfied with her life, then.. fine. But she... didn't seem happy to me, or to the thousands of people who saw her video where all she really wanted was tickets to Greece (which really isn't that much to ask when your billionaire husband in particular comes from the airline business), and.... he got her an egg apron.

I just- what I can expect from life? Is my corner of the world that desperate to push me into roles that were outdated in the 80s? 90s? Is my society that determined to force me into positions that my ancestors were also forced to endure? Some people are okay with living the house wife role- but they could choose to do that. Some people are okay with being a house-husband even, because they could choose to do that. (Hypothetically speaking- you never know what goes on behind closed doors. Sometimes it's abuse.... but sometimes it really is nothing. That alone is a whole conversation.) From a societal perspective, if I decided I wanted to stay at home and be a wife and mother, nobody could stop me from doing so. However, if I don't want to do that (and I can't say I'm interested), I am also free to do literally anything else as well.

But with everything that's going on, is that what I can expect? Am I going to live in some Handmaiden's Tale-dystopia where no matter my situation and no matter how good of a person my partner may be- am I going to be subject to my partner in the eyes of the law when we used to be equals? And is going to sting all the more knowing I had no say in any of it as we progress towards that future?",1,1744579057.0,u_OrdinaryOlive3566,2,1.0,False

It seems like from the day we brought her home my wife has started to resent me more every day. My wife is a stay at home mom. I own a business that is decently successful so she was able to quit her job as soon as she found out she was pregnant. She made it very clear to me that her dream has always been to be a stay at home mom, so we made it work. We built a brand new house a couple years ago, I just bought her a brand new SUV with cash so we don’t have a car payment. All of the insurance, cell phone bills, and vehicle gas are paid for through the business, so she literally has zero financial worries. 

I get up every day at 5am to go to work. Our daughter is now sleeping through the night so my wife usually gets up around 6 and does a few things until our daughter gets up between 7-8. I work 6a-5p five days a week and most saturdays I go into work for a few hours. When I get home at night, I immediately take the baby and let my wife cook or water her plants for a while (that’s her hobby). I always give our daughter her last bottle before bed and put her to sleep. 

During the week while I’m drowning in emails and stressed to the max, she goes shopping with her semi-retired mom and goes walking on the neighborhood bike trail, gets Starbucks coffee, etc. I never criticize her for these things. I know she’s working insanely hard as a stay at home mom BUT THATS WHAT SHE CHOSE. 

On the weekends, I help my wife clean the house (or entertain our daughter while she does it), go as a family to get groceries, go for nature walks together, etc. I have basically given up all of my hobbies because she seems to hate how much time I already spend away from the house at work during the week. 

We seem to get along great, but if I even do ONE thing that my wife sees as a mistake or problem she completely blows up on me. Today, when we got home from getting groceries she asked me to unload the car while she got our daughter out (she was crying) and got her fed. I had to go to the restroom so I unloaded the car and then went to our bathroom. She immediately started yelling at me saying she needed help and that she was starting to get pissed. I told her I was using the restroom, to which she said “I NEEDED TO WASH MY HANDS AND GET A DRINK OF WATER AND YOU DON’T HELP ME FOR ONE SECOND. ILL JUST DO IT MYSELF!” I walk out and she’s scolding me for how I need to use my common sense and see when she needs help. I apologize, and she says “why don’t you go mow your f*****g lawn or something”. 

That leads me on to another topic. I mow, take care of keeping our vehicles washed, do all of the yard work (we live on 6 acres of land and have a big yard)but when I go do that stuff it’s almost like she resents me for getting time away from the baby. I ask her if she would rather do it and she always says no. 

I’m getting tired of feeling like I can’t win. I work my butt off so everyone has everything they want and it’s like she doesn’t see the 99% of things I do right, only the 1% I do wrong. 😑 ",60,1744579010.0,daddit,51,0.86,False

For me, I literally cannot do work on my laptop without a keyboard or mouse, it's just way too inconveneint to type on the laptop keyboard and use the mouse pad on my Mac. Just too slow and inefficient.

I want to try working at coffee shops but slightly worried this might looks too over the top.

Sound familiar?

Most people rely on willpower. But high performers?

This is what they rely on

When I started habit stacking, everything changed:

Gym 4x a week. 
Learning 2 languages.
Managing a full-time job.
Still travelling & creating content.

It's bound to get overwhelming, right?

It did at one point. But then I realized it doesn't need to because there are habits that I do daily. 

My body clock is wired and accustomed to these actions. 

So why not add my interests to these habits and stack them?

Want to habit stack like me? This is how I do it:

I attach a new habit to one I already do. During my workout, I listen to a French podcast.

I keep it small and effortless. After brushing my teeth, I try to read 1 page of a book or a few Quran verses. 

I look to create identity-based triggers. “Because I train, I eat like an athlete.” 

I don't compare with others progress. Don't worry about that guy who writes 20 long-form threads a day or that girl who squats triple the amount.

It takes practice. 

Identify your daily habits and routines. See what interests you want to add and stack them with things you do already. 

Understand that it's the small levels of consistency that will keep you pushing towards growth. 

Stack 1: Morning routine = Notes overview 
Stack 2: Morning coffee = Plan top 3 tasks
Stack 3: Commute = Listen to podcast for growth
Stack 4: Lunchtime = Reading
Stack 5: Evening routine = Writing

Now I don’t rely on motivation.

It’s automatic.

It’s structured.

## Key Features Analysis

The performance of a USB-C wireless mouse hinges on several technical specifications that determine its responsiveness,accuracy,and overall user experience. We will examine the DPI, polling rate, sensor type, battery life, and build quality of the top models.

**DPI (Dots Per Inch)**

DPI indicates the sensitivity of the mouse, influencing how far the cursor moves on the screen relative to physical mouse movement. A higher DPI allows for faster cursor movement with less physical effort; however, excessively high DPI can lead to reduced precision. Modern USB-C wireless mice often offer adjustable DPI settings, allowing users to customize sensitivity based on their screen resolution and personal preference. Top-rated models offer DPI ranges from 400 to 16,000 or even higher, catering to diverse needs from detailed graphic design work to fast-paced gaming. The ability to fine-tune DPI on-the-fly is a key feature, often enabled by dedicated buttons on the mouse itself.

**Polling Rate**

The polling rate refers to how frequently the mouse reports its position to the computer,measured in Hertz (Hz). A higher polling rate translates to lower latency and a more responsive feel, especially noticeable in fast-paced applications. A polling rate of 1000Hz, which is typical for high-performance gaming mice, means the mouse reports its position 1000 times per second. Lower polling rates, such as 125Hz, may introduce subtle lag, impacting precision and responsiveness. USB-C wireless mice generally support a range of polling rates accessible through software, allowing users to optimize between responsiveness and battery life.

**Sensor Type**

the sensor is the heart of any mouse, dictating its accuracy and tracking ability. Optical sensors use an LED and a camera to track movement, offering good performance on most surfaces. Laser sensors, on the other hand, use a laser diode, enabling them to track on a wider variety of surfaces, including glossy and reflective materials. However, laser sensors can sometiems exhibit issues with acceleration or jitter. Current-generation USB-C wireless mice frequently enough feature advanced optical sensors with improved tracking accuracy and reduced latency, often exceeding the performance of older laser sensors. Many come with features like surface calibration that adjusts performance based on the surface being used.

**Battery Life**

Wireless mice rely on batteries, and battery life remains a crucial factor for user convenience. USB-C connectivity has streamlined charging, making it faster and more convenient than older micro-USB solutions. Modern USB-C wireless mice often boast extraordinary battery life, ranging from several weeks to several months on a single charge, depending on usage and settings. Some models even support rapid charging, providing hours of usage from just a few minutes of charging. Efficient power management and features like automatic sleep mode contribute to extended battery life.

**Build Quality and Ergonomics**

The build quality and ergonomics considerably impact the comfort and durability of a mouse. High-quality materials like ABS plastic or aluminum provide a robust feel and withstand daily wear and tear. Ergonomic design focuses on shaping the mouse to fit comfortably in the hand, reducing strain and fatigue during prolonged use. Factors such as the shape, size, button placement, and surface texture all contribute to ergonomics. Many USB-C wireless mice offer ambidextrous designs or right-handed configurations tailored for specific grip styles (palm, claw, fingertip). Elements like textured grips and customizable weights also enhance user comfort and control.

I'm a graduating in May and looking for short-term accommodations for my parents who will be visiting from India during commencement week (May 21-29). I've been late to the search and unfortunately hotels and Airbnbs are now prohibitively expensive.

Ideally looking for:

* A furnished apartment/studio/room (exclusive housing would be nice, but shared would also work)
* Close to Brown campus (or nearby neighborhoods)
* Access to a kitchen for making tea/coffee and occasional cooking (they'll mostly eat with me)
* Quiet space for two respectful guests who are early to bed/early to rise

My parents are very simple folks with minimal expectations - just a comfortable bed, clean bathroom, and quiet space. They're extremely respectful, quiet individuals who won't be a bother to anyone sharing the space.

I know most sublets are for longer periods (summer-long), but hoping someone might be flexible for this special occasion. Willing to negotiate fair rates for this timeframe.

Please DM me if you have anything available or know someone who might!

Thank you!",5,1744578797.0,providence,2,1.0,False

So, I (19F) live with my roommate, Jess ( 20F). We’ve been roommates for about 6 months now. Jess is really laid-back, but sometimes she doesn’t think things through.

This weekend, we were going out to a party and she accidentally spilled coffee on her favorite dress. She was freaking out because the party was in a couple of hours, and she didn’t have time to do laundry.

She asked if she could borrow one of my dresses for the night, and I said no. I’ve never let anyone borrow my clothes, and I explained that I just don’t feel comfortable with it. Jess got upset and said that I’m being selfish and unsympathetic because I have plenty of clothes I don’t wear, and it’s not like I was going to wear them that night.

I felt bad for her, but I just didn’t want to risk my clothes getting ruined. I tried offering her other solutions — like ordering a new dress online or borrowing something from her mom. But she was really disappointed and now she’s giving me the cold shoulder.

I don’t think I’m the asshole, but a few of our mutual friends are saying I could’ve been more understanding. I just didn’t feel comfortable with it.

I've done my best to research everything I can about the island, but I'd love some feedback to make our precious 5 days there even better! 

For context, we're big hikers, snorkelers, and nature-lovers. We're not big on shopping, crowds, or fancy restaurants.

   * Wailua Shave Ice
* Stop at [Kilauea Fish Market](https://www.kilaueafishmarket.com/) for takeout dinner on way back?

* Dinner at Hanalei Poke Co

**Tuesday**

* 8 a.m. leave Princeville for Waimea Canyon State Park
   * Take Waimea Canyon Road (Highway 550) to get in (more scenic)
   * First stop should be Waimea Canyon Lookout (mile marker 10)
   * Second stop should be Puʻu Hinahina Lookout (mile marker 13.5)
   * Third stop should be Puʻu o Kila (mile marker 19)

Context: MIL has been boundary-stomping and guilt-tripping for months. She gave a non-apology, kept pushing for visits with LO, and acted like me giving birth was something she was entitled to front-row seats for. I’ve stayed silent and SO has handled communication. And despite multiple calm, honest conversations, the IL’s have continued to ignore the root issue.

Well… this morning SO let them know he wouldn’t be coming over for a quick visit like he planned  (LO had a rough teething night and we got like zero sleep), and the emotional fallout began.

Here’s the message from FIL to SO:

“SO I love you guys very much but I can't tell you how disappointed I am. Your Mom who would do anything for you, has been though a shit ton of pain both physically and emotionally this year. MIL has NOT done anything to deserve this treatment. You can't even come over to pick up Christmas presents for our grandchild. WHAT did we do to deserve this treatment. You and OP have totally cut your selves out from your families. We deserve real explanation. What would you do if either one of you were really sick and needed help. You have families that you just closing off. Did we do anything in your childhood to deserve this treatment. Talk to me Father to son or Man to Man.”

Also MIL sent this to SO:

“Do you want us to come over there to help with LO? You all could rest.
I can still hold a teething baby and not get upset
Babies are supposed to cry when they don't feel good.
I love you guys, too
I never thought you and OP would treat us this way. You both know how much I love babies”

Funny enough, this is the same man who cried in front of SO a few months ago saying he felt terrible about how I was treated and wanted to apologize in person. Apparently that empathy expired.

So yeah… I’m not saying I’m thrilled to be proven right, but I am saying thank you to everyone who told me to hold the line. Their own behavior is doing the talking now and they don’t like what it’s saying.

I’ll keep you all posted. For now, I’ll be over here drinking my coffee with a front-row seat to the meltdown.

	•	Places that are worth overnight stays vs. quick stops
	•	Any August-specific tips – crowds, road conditions, weather heads-up?

I’m hoping for a good mix of nature, coast, light hiking, and just relaxing with great views. Appreciate any recs you’ve got – and shoutout to this sub for helping shape this trip just by being awesome!

Elisa Muse
The ringing in my ears is so annoying that I have no choice but to wake up. I check the time, ""Who the f**k calls me at three in the morning?"" I grumpily complain, then I stare at the screen and sigh,
""Of course, she will be the one calling..."" I sighed, and after missing the first call, I got on the first ring, the second.
""Hi, Grandma..."" I said in a sleepy but cheerful voice. My grandmother is the bomb.
""Oh, Elisa... I hope I am not interrupting you in your chores, darling..."" she said, and I scrunched my eyebrows. No matter how long I have lived abroad, she never gets the time difference right.
I yawned, ""No, Grams, I was sleeping. It is three in the morning..."" I said,
""What are you doing at that hour?"" she asked, appalled. ""You are young, yes, but you still need your beauty sleep,"" she advised, making me laugh.
Is she for real? She was the one who woke me up with her call... I took a deep breath and closed my eyes,
""Well, lucky for you, I am up... so what's new, Grams?"" I asked,
""Oh, honey... I was calling you about something... but I don't remember what it was... I am sure it will come to me..."" she said, and my heart squeezed. My grandmother is entirely functional, but her mind slips sometimes... I love her to pieces, but with her almost ninety years of age, the possibility of not having her around increases every day. That is why I don't complain whenever she calls me at odd hours.
""So, tell me... How have you been?"" she asked,
""I am doing great, Grams. The fashion house I work for is planning a huge runway, and guess whose designs made the cut?"" I said in a sing-song voice.
""You are very talented. I am sure you got that from me. And your beauty comes from this side of the family..."" she said matter-of-factly, despite me being a carbon copy of my mother.
""Oh! I remembered..."" she said triumphantly, and I waited for her to say whatever she needed.
""What is it, Grams?"" I asked her after the long pause she held.
""Eddie is coming home for Christmas..."" She announced proudly, and I almost gasped. Eddie, my brother, is a very famous music producer. He tours the globe most of the year with his band, the Abbotts Red. He hasn't been home for a while, and I managed to see him briefly two years ago when he made a quick pit-stop in Paris...
""Wow, Grams, that is nice... He finally made time to pause and return to the mothership..."" I joked, and she giggled.
""So, here is the plan..."" she said, not giving room for any arguments. ""Everyone, and I mean that... will be home for the Holidays... I want all my grandkids, kids, and everyone here with me..."" She paused, and I froze.
I haven't been back home either. It has been five years since my heart got broken, stomped about, chewed, and spat back. I had been avoiding the moment I had to return, and I was about to yell at her that I wouldn't return home or celebrate the Holidays. I stopped celebrating five years ago and see no reason to start now. ""Elisa, I am getting old and want one last memory of my family. I am starting to forget things, and I can see it in your dad's face... he is worried about me... Buddy, too..."" she sighed,
""Would you? Please? For me?"" she pleaded, and with a tear escaping my eyes, I took a deep breath and barfed,
""Of course, Grams, I will be there for the Holidays..."" My voice choked. This was hard for me to do, but she was right. Who knows if this could be her last Christmas, if not physically, mentally, with us? She wants to treasure one more holiday in her heart because her mind is starting to fail.
""Excellent... I knew you would say yes..."" She sighed, and then she paused.
""Hello?"" she said,
""Grams?"" I muttered,
""Oh, darling... it is nice that you have called..."" she sighed, and I choked... Yes, my Grams were slipping into oblivion more frequently, even if I didn't celebrate Holidays and swore never to return to that place... I will do it for her... for the memories we will create and treasure forever.
""I love you, Grams..."" I sighed, and she chuckled.
""Don't tell the others... but you are my favorite..."" she mumbled, making me laugh. I was sure she told that to everyone... and I mean it... I heard her say the same thing to Eddie once, and there is no doubt she has said it to Amanda or Peyton.
""I've got to go, Grams. Say hi to Buddy. I love you both!"" I sighed, and she said goodbye, finishing the call.
""Putain, qui t'appelle à cette heure?"" (Who calls you at this hour?) Collette, my best friend and roommate, stood at the threshold of my room. She worked for the same fashion house, and we were each other's rides or dies.
""My grandmother..."" I replied, and she sighed.
""Honey..."" she sat beside me, realizing I had tears in my eyes. ""Is it that bad?"" she asked, and I nodded.
""Worse, she was slipping away and asked me to return home for Christmas..."" I sighed, and she patted my head, running her fingers in my messy locks.
""I think it is time for you to go... five years... you are not the same, and I am sure things have changed..."" she sighed, and I nodded.
""Maybe... but I don't celebrate anything anymore... but I will pretend for Grams' sake,"" I added.
""It looks like you will need reinforcements..."" she sighed, and I nodded with a pout.
""Will you?"" I asked, and she chuckled.
""Are there any hot guys in your little American town? You know I am out of luck with Parisian guys... I am too much for them..."" She said confidently, and I shrugged my shoulders.
""A couple of jerks, maybe..."" I sighed,
""Those are enough to get a good laid..."" she said enthusiastically. Collette's standards were way below average. Every time we went out, it ended the same way: I came back alone because she had hooked up with some random dude... I wished she could see how amazing and worthy she was. She deserved the world, but she had permanently settled for peanuts.
On the other hand, I knew my worth and was traded for peanuts. After that, I never bounced back, never recovered fully, and I knew that the pestering wound would come out bursting as soon as I stepped home. I needed Collette there; she was the only one who could contain the outburst.
""Scoot over, let's catch some sleep, and we will talk about it tomorrow..."" She made a spot on my bed for herself, and having her around made me feel secure and comfortable. Despite that, sleep never came back. My mind reeled about what had happened five years ago, and my stomach churned with the idea of seeing him again.
I never spoke to him. I left and never turned around. Could it be that he will realize what he has lost when he sees it? Is my heart ready to see him? Would he be as handsome as ever? What would I say? What would he say? Suddenly, the promise I made to Grandma seemed like a terrible idea...
Would I ever be ready to go back to our town? The most festive city during the Holidays? The townspeople call it 'Mistletoe Town' as a joke. I had no idea if I was ready, but I would return home for her: My Grams.
 
Elisa Muse
Colette and I woke up early the following day. We had a plane to catch, a long flight to endure, and a family to face... at least, I have to.
We cleared security and headed to the nearest airport coffee shop to fuel the day. I was not a morning person and a nasty woman without coffee, which is essential to taming the beast.
""Are you ready?"" Colette said, and I nodded.
""Thanks for coming along. I am sure it will be a wild ride,"" I said, and she nodded.
""Anything for you, ma biche..."" She giggled, and I rolled my eyes.
""But I was not asking you about taking the plane and leaving Paris. I was asking about being there and the odd possibility of running into the man..."" she said, and my stomach churned.
Five years ago, my entire life changed...
FLASHBACK
""I can't believe it is only a week away!"" I said to my mother, and she smiled.
""Yes, you and Noah have been together since you were in diapers... this is a dream come true..."" Mom said while fixing the veil on my head. I was on my last dress fitting before the wedding. The most minor tweaks that must be done for it to be perfect.
It was a dream come true for both of our families. I still remember how elated my mother was when Noah and I broke the news about us being officially boyfriend and girlfriend four years ago. Noel and I were high school sweethearts; we were official by the end of our 9th year, and against all odds, we were together through high school... naturally, we wanted to leave for college as husband and wife. My parents were best friends with his parents, and in a way, we were fulfilling the family's dream.
""Mom, did you get wedding jitters'"" I asked her, and she smiled.
""Sweetie, yes... I almost didn't marry your father..."" She smiled and cupped my cheek tenderly. The glow in her eyes said it all... she loved my father even more than the first day, and she hoped the dream would become a reality for me. She and Sammy, Noah's mom, always said that we were meant to be together.
""Why would you ask that?"" Mom bit her lower lip, and fear crossed her eyes.
""I don´t know. Noah was my first boyfriend, a peck and everything, and now marrying him will mean he will be my first forever."" I paused, feeling a big knot settle in my stomach.
""Are you having trouble with him?"" Mom asked. ""Because I can talk to Sammy and ask her to straighten him out,"" Mom said in her heavy, nonsense tone.
""Oh No! Mother! It was just a question,"" I quickly said, and she nodded.
Deep down, the knot in the pit of my stomach, the nerves, the wedding jitters, but the lack of spark in Noah's eyes when he spotted me told a completely different story. I was happy, Noah as a catch, and I was too... it was a match made in heaven, the perfect couple, the perfect family, and the perfect future... but nothing is perfect... I am going to blame everything on these nerves and brush it off; after all, a week from now, I am going to be away on my honeymoon in Paris. Paris! I can't wait!
Mom and I made our way back home. We kept these appointments secret to surprise Grams with the beautiful gown we had made for the special day. I was barely nineteen, and Noah was a year older. However, due to a severe case of dyslexia when he was younger, he was pushed a year behind in school. I was with him through all of it as a friend—we have always been friends—and I trust him with my life.
Grams sulked when we arrived because we hadn't included her in the last dress fitting. As I headed to my bedroom, Mom took care of her, and I found a small note under my door. Eddie's friend Noel also often left notes or stickers at my door. Despite being boyfriend and girlfriend and soon to be married, we had established clear boundaries regarding space and privacy so he would never dream of entering my room when I wasn't there.
I picked up the note and unfolded it...
""POOL HOUSE @7,
N""
I giggled. Noel had been most anxious about our honeymoon, and even when we promised to consummate our love once we were married, I was not immune to his charms and a good make-out session.
If I must be honest, I couldn't wait either... Maybe we can eat the cake before the wedding tonight. After all, what is a week in the grand scheme of things? My heart fluttered, and my hands felt clammy.
I checked the time, and it was close to seven. I changed my outfit into something more cute and my underwear into a hot, lacey one. If I allow Noel to pop my cherry tonight, I want to do it in style.
I sneaked out of my home. If my family saw me walking out, they would ask endless questions. These are questions I was not in the mood to answer. I silently made my way to the pool house.
The pool house was an apartment my parents first had as a storage place. When Eddie chose to study music, they remodeled it and converted it into a two-bedroom apartment with a music studio. That way, if Eddie had a spur of inspiration, he would have a place to crash.
Everyone knew the pool house as Eddie's man cave, which went unused while he was studying in New York. So, naturally, while he was out, it was our official make-out place...
I walked closer and heard some noise inside. My stomach quickly flipped, knowing Noel was waiting for me. I took a deep breath and silently opened the door. I was ready to be his, even though we were not married.
My entire body wanted this, my heart belonged to him, it was natural that my body would too...
With silent steps, I made my way to the upstairs bedrooms... Then I saw the light coming from one of the doors. He must be waiting for me there. The door was slightly open, and when I was about to push it to walk in, I heard,
""Oh, God... Noah..."" a female voice moaned.
Instead of opening the door, I peered through the door crack, and undressed on the bed, was Noah pumping hard into Adrianna Carter... Of all the people he chose to cheat on me, it had to be her. The woman who hated my guts, my nemesis...
""f**k, Adri... you feel so good..."" he grunted while the slapping noises increased in intensity.
The same intensity that shattered my heart, the same slapping I would feel... Tears welled in my eyes and fell even against my will...
I saw enough, and I was about to retire silently and confront him once I was on a better estate, but the sob I was painfully holding in escaped... aldo against my will... He stopped and turned around to see my retrieved figure...
""Ellie..."" He screamed while I ran like the devil and locked myself in my bedroom.
Moments later, I heard a knock on my door, ""Ellie..."" his voice boomed on the other side...
""It is over..."" I mumbled between tears...
I heard a gasp, and I knew the entire audience was there... I was sure they saw me running inside and then Noah following me... My family loved to be in everyone's business, and this was no exception.
I took a deep breath and opened the door. Turning to stare at my parents, I said, ""I am leaving tomorrow. "" With that, I locked myself in my room again. This town holds too many memories and too much pain. The entire dream had been crushed and stomped upon, and I was sure I would never be able to love again, unlike I had always loved Noah.
The following morning, I packed a bag, went to the airport, purchased a ticket to Paris, and left, hoping never to return. However, I was heading back.
END OF FLASHBACK
""You spaced out,"" Colette said, and I gave her a tight smile. Our plane took off while I was going down horror memory lane.
""I'm sorry. Some unpleasant memories crawled into my head,"" I said, shaking my head. She held my hand.
""We have two options..."" She wiggled her eyebrows... ""Either we get pissed out drunk, or we sleep without drinking..."" She giggled...
""Pissed out drunk..."" I said, and she clapped. Of course, anything to drown the pain and tuck it back into the corner where it was locked away.",1,1744578317.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1jyhzyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jyhzyd/a_coworker_destroyed_the_toilet_at_my_workplace/,A co-worker destroyed the toilet at my workplace and blamed me. What should I do next?,"This is awkward, I know. I promise it’s not a joke. I’m so fucked.

My co-worker (let’s call him H) completely wrecked the toilet at work. He filled it up with diarrhoea that quite literally looks like dalgona coffee. It’s on the floor, too. He wasn’t able to flush so he ended up sticking a lot of toilet paper to the ceiling, and filled the bin with it. It smells HORRENDOUS in there. Everyone knows it was him, he’s done it before, just never quite to this extent.

Our manager has said whoever it was has to clean it up by Wednesday or he’s getting a key for the toilet that we will have to collect from him when we need it (presumably so that he’ll know who’s been in there and when).

H told my friend at work that it was me, and my friend asked me one lunch break quietly if it was me, and obviously I denied it. She stated that H has told almost everyone that it was me, so my manager likely thinks it was me too.

What can I do about this? I don’t wanna end up having to clean up H’s shit for fuck’s sake.",1,1744578218.0,Advice,4,0.6,False

1jyhz9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jyhz9k/antlers_in_the_sky/,Antlers in the Sky,"**Antlers in the Sky**

Hello all. My computer has just flickered on. The lights outside must be fucking with the power again. I’m typing this as fast as I can, so apologies for any misspellings. My hands are shaking. The fire went out hours ago and I’m too afraid to relight it—relight my humble beacon against the lights.

Those goddamn lights.

The village of Nenana is a peaceful place. Fewer than 50 of us. We live out in the bushes, central Alaska, north of any reasonable human, along the Sushana River. It’s quiet here. We hunt, fish, work the forest for timber, and keep to ourselves. Folks from Outside pass through sometimes, pause, marvel at the little log houses, and gawk as we go about our daily lives. I was born here. I was raised here. And from the looks of things, I’ll die here.

I’m a young man, 20 winters. Raised by my grandparents after my father passed in a blizzard while hunting. I still remember his frozen body as it was dragged on the sled behind the snowmachine. His face—blue-black, like the crimson dark of night. I remember his eyes. I remember the village gathering, a lone drumbeat echoing like the heartbeat of our community. I saw a raven fly. We laid him to rest—a whole day of mourning, and everyone came.

I saw it once. Before everything really started to go bad. I was out hunting caribou on the flats north of the river, a couple miles past the old trapper’s line. It was cold, late November. I had my .243 and a thermos of tea, and I’d been tracking a small herd that’d wandered down from the foothills. It was quiet—too quiet. No wind, no birds, not even the distant groan of ice shifting beneath the snow. Just me, the rifle, and my breath clouding the air.

I spotted the caribou standing still in a patch of stunted willows. I took a knee, lined up my shot, and then something made me stop. Not a sound. Not a movement. Just… a feeling. Like I wasn’t alone. Like something was watching me. I turned my head just a little—and that’s when I saw it.

It was standing at the tree line, maybe two hundred yards off. Tall. Too tall. Like a man, but stretched. Arms longer than they should’ve been, fingertips grazing its knees. Its head was wrong—like it was wearing something. At first I thought it was a caribou skull. But it moved. Antlers shifting, twitching like branches in a storm. No face. No features. Just those two pits of darkness where its eyes should’ve been, sucking in the light of day.

The caribou didn’t see it. Or maybe they did and froze. They’re prey animals—they know when a real predator’s near.

I didn’t take the shot. I don’t even remember lowering the rifle. Just that one second I looked, and then it was gone. Like it blinked out of existence.

I told myself it was a trick of the light. A shadow. Too much caffeine. But deep down, I knew better. That was no animal. That wasn’t anything I was meant to see.

It started months ago. Or was it weeks? Hell, it might’ve been yesterday. First, Old Isaiah didn’t stop in. I was working my incredibly boring job at our town’s only gas station and general store. Sitting behind my desk, I watched our people ebb and flow, tumbling through life like the river. Every day that man came in. He shuffled with a limp, walked like a just-born caribou calf. Lived on the edge of town, in a run-down cabin left behind when some family moved Outside. I found comfort in his visits—in our silent exchanges, in the same bag of coffee grounds, the same nod, the same mumble as I handed him his change.

Then one day he didn’t come.

I waited, drumming my fingers on the counter in time with the twangy country music on the radio. Zach Bryan, maybe? I always hated him. But Isaiah didn’t show. I brushed it off. Maybe his shitbox pickup finally died. Maybe he just didn’t want coffee. Maybe he was out of money. I passed it off. Continued my day.

Zero customers. New record.

A few days passed. Still no Isaiah. No one said anything, but I started noticing the way folks looked over their shoulders. It was like a quiet breath had passed through the village, taking something with it.

Then the dogs started acting strange. My neighbor, a crusty old man named Jimbo with a beard that looked like frostbite, came in one morning—eyes wide, skin pale like he’d seen something deep. He said all three of his sled dogs had broken their leads and run off in the night. “Tails tucked. Howlin’ like the spirits were on their asses.” That’s what he said. I laughed it off, but there was something in his voice. He wasn’t joking.

Jimbo don’t scare easy.

The air felt… wrong.

The lights started acting strange after that.

You hear stories, growing up here. How the northern lights are the spirits of the dead. That you should never whistle at them or wave, or they’ll come down and take you with them. I always thought that was just stuff my grandma said to keep me from playing outside too late.

But one night I looked up, and they were… pulsing. Not like normal. Not pretty or gentle. These twisted. Seethed. Like something alive. They weren’t green. They were red. Blood red, like an open wound across the sky.

And I swear to God, I heard something whisper my name.

That was the first time I dreamed of the thing. It stood just past the treeline behind my cabin. Seven feet tall. Blacker than shadow. Its arms were too long, and its eyes didn’t glow—they swallowed light. No face. No sound. Just... there. Watching. When I woke up, there were footprints in the snow. Big ones. Leading up to my window. Then stopping.

I told myself it was a moose. A weird dream. A dumb coincidence.

But I didn’t sleep the next night.

We’re Gwich’in here. Most of us. My family too, though we’ve got some Koyukon blood, way back. This land—it’s ours. Not just because we live here, but because it remembers us. Our stories are written in the rivers, in the bones buried beneath the permafrost. The ancestors are supposed to watch over us. Guide us.

But lately, it feels like they’ve turned their backs.

Then Isaiah’s cabin caught fire.

No one saw it happen. Just smoke in the morning and ash by noon. No body found. No tracks. Just scorched earth and twisted timber. Folks said he probably left town, took a lantern with him and knocked something over.

But I know Isaiah. The man could barely walk. He wouldn’t have gone anywhere.

After that, more people started disappearing. Not in crowds. Just one by one. Like the lights reached a little lower each night, and someone would vanish.

No one talked about it. Not directly. But you could feel it—like the whole village was holding its breath. Doors locked earlier. Radios went quiet. Everyone was watching the sky.

And I...

I started seeing things. Shapes. Movements in the trees. Reflections in the windows that weren’t mine. My own shadow stretching longer than it should. The lights got inside. Not the house. Inside me.

The elders used to talk about things—not to be spoken of after dark. Stories about creatures that live between worlds. The ones that come in winter, when the light hangs in the sky and the snow deadens all sound. My grandma used to say there were places the spirits never stopped walking. Places too old and too quiet for us to understand.

I never believed in those stories.

Until now.

Old Annie, one of the last true matriarchs in the village, started talking nonsense. Said she saw something with bone antlers and a stitched mouth walking along the ridgeline. Said it wore the skins of people it took. That it mimicked voices—called from the woods in the tones of lost loved ones. A trickster spirit. A hunter.

We didn’t believe her.

She froze to death on her porch the next night. Sitting straight up. Eyes open. Mouth slack—like she’d seen God and He’d walked past without noticing her.

After that, some of the Gwich’in packed up. Said they were heading Outside, or down to stay with relatives in another village. The old ways say to leave when the spirits get thick in the air. When the dogs refuse to go outside. When the ravens stop circling. I wanted to go too. But something kept me here.

Or maybe I just didn’t want to bring it with me.

It’s hard to explain the way the lights look now. They don’t shimmer. They crawl. Like they’re made of something solid, reaching down from the heavens. You stare too long and your thoughts turn inside out. You start remembering things you never lived. Blood in the snow. Screams that don’t belong to anyone you know. You forget where you are.

One night, I heard my dad’s voice outside the cabin. He’s been dead ten years.

“Open up, boy,” he said. Just like he used to when he’d get home from hunting. “It’s cold as a witch’s tit out here.”

I almost opened the door.

Almost.

Then I saw the shadow pass the window.

It wasn’t him.

Now it’s just me. Everyone’s gone. Or dead. I don’t know anymore.

The general store’s empty. The generator blew two nights ago. The river’s frozen stiff. No snowmachines. No dogs. No one.

I’m holed up in the old garage cabin now. Mine was too close to the treeline. Too exposed. I’ve boarded the windows. Blocked the chimney. I haven’t seen the stars in days—just the lights. Always the lights.

It stands outside now. I see it every night. Just past the trees. Antlers scraped raw. Eyes like holes in the world.

Waiting.

Watching.

Sometimes I think it is the lights. Or the lights are just the smoke it gives off. The radiation of its mind burning through the sky.

I don’t sleep anymore. I don’t eat much. I keep this computer warm in my sleeping bag just so I can write. Just so someone might know what happened here. Maybe if the next person reads this, they won’t make the same mistakes. Maybe they won’t whistle at the lights.

They never tell you that madness is gentle at first.

Just a flicker.

A whisper.

Then it opens its eyes.

**Part Two – Downriver**

My name’s Baptiste DuMont. I trap lines between Fairbanks and Nenana—mostly marten and fox this time of year, sometimes lynx if I’m lucky. I make my rounds late in the fall, head upriver before freeze-up, and paddle down after. I don’t rush. There’s no one waiting for me.

It was early December when I rounded the bend where the Sushana feeds into the Tanana. Ice was gathering at the edges, slow and stubborn, but the current still moved. It was too late for most folks to be out, but I’d gotten hung up in a snowstorm west of Manley and figured I’d swing by Nenana for fuel and dry socks before I pulled in for the season.

I’ve been going through Nenana for over twenty years. Always liked that village. Small, tight-knit. Mostly Gwich’in, some Koyukon families. Good people. The kids used to wave from the riverbank when I’d float by. Old folks would sometimes trade dry meat for pelts. There was a rhythm to the place. Like an old drumbeat you could count on.

But when I landed, the rhythm was gone.

The first thing I noticed was the silence. No smoke from chimneys. No barking dogs. No snowmachines rumbling in the distance. Just my paddle knocking ice chunks and the soft gurgle of the river dying for the season.

I pulled my canoe up near the old boat ramp and climbed the bank. Everything was still. Too still.

The houses stood like hollow bones—doors swinging open, windows boarded or broken. The general store was shuttered, the gas pumps iced over. I called out. No answer. Walked through the center of town, listening for a baby crying, a fire crackling, hell—even a raven. Nothing.

I found footprints, though. One set. Deep in the snow, heading out toward the far side of the village. Toward the tree line.

They were old. Week old, maybe more. Melted into the snow so much that they barely resembled boot tracks.

At first, I thought someone had stayed behind. Maybe sick or stuck or scared. But the longer I followed them, the more I realized something was wrong. They wandered. Back and forth. Looping around cabins. Stopping in the middle of the road like the person forgot where they were going. Like they were being hunted—or trying to decide whether to run.

Then I found the old garage cabin.

Door barricaded from the inside. Smoke-stained windows. A pile of wood chopped and stacked out back, long turned to ice. There were scratches in the siding—high up, maybe eight feet off the ground. Deep ones. Not from a bear.

I pried the door open with my axe. Took everything I had. The cold inside hit me like a wall. No heat. No fire.

The first thing that struck me was the axe. Slammed into the frame above the door. An old felling axe, its birch handle white against the smear of dried blood which ran down the handle like a open wound in the wood. 

I stepped over the broken door, moved under the axe. Shell casings littered the floor. Rifle rounds. I saw a hunting rifle, bent almost clean in half. The stock was splintered, barrel bent like it was made of plastic rather than steel. Dried blood littered the floor. Old. Not red enough to be fresh, but still red enough to be blood.

There was a cot. A sleeping bag. A laptop—dead now, screen cracked. Notebooks scattered around the floor. Drawings in charcoal and pen. Symbols I didn’t recognize. A figure sketched over and over—tall, antlers like driftwood, face a blur of black ink. Always standing. Always watching.

Blood covered the cot, plaid wool blanket ripped off as if its owner was torn out, ripped like the guts out of a fish. The blood led up to foot of a ladder, must go to the storage loft I figured. I told myself I’d check it out later.

I found the last page taped to the wall above the cot.

*""Don’t look at the lights. Don’t speak to the voice. Don’t leave the cabin.""*

Underneath, scratched in shaky handwriting: *“The river forgets, but the woods remember.”*

I was getting scared now. I hadn’t been that scared in years. My hands shook, I drew my knife. I don’t know why, but it made me feel more comfortable. I started to climb the ladder, it creaked under my weight. 

He sat curled in the loft. Back to the window. He was frozen. The cheery “Iditarod 2020 Team ReRun” t-shirt crusted with frost. Braids flopped lifeless against the floor, one covering his face. There was a pool of frozen blood beneath his head. A revolver lay next to his hand. A single hole in the side of his head showed as the only sign of death. I picked up the revolver, held it, spun the cilinder. One spent casing. 

That night, I stayed in the store. To tell you the truth, I was scared to leave. Lit a fire in the back room stove. Tried to sleep.

The lights came out around midnight.

I watched from under a blanket, through a crack in the door.

They didn’t dance. They spun, slow and heavy, like something breathing. Red and green and something deeper—colors I don’t have words for. And for a moment, I saw it.

On the ridge. Against the aurora.

Tall.

Still.

Head crowned in antlers that scraped the sky.

It didn’t move. But I swear it saw me.

I left at dawn. Didn’t take the time to grab more firewood or refill my lantern. Just pushed off from the bank and paddled hard until the village was a smudge behind me.

I won’t go back.

Not to Nenana.

Not to those woods.

Something’s out there.

And it’s waiting.

1jyhwvd,https://i.redd.it/19tp35822oue1.png,Why Ambition Without Alignment Leads to Burnout — And What Leaders Can Do Differently,"**TL;DR:**  
High ambition is often celebrated in leadership, but when it’s not aligned with personal values or well-being, it leads to burnout and disengagement. This post explores research-backed strategies like psychological detachment, values-based goal setting, microbreaks, and mindful stress management to help leaders build sustainable momentum.  

---  

One of the patterns I’ve seen repeatedly in coaching executives and leaders is this:  
They’re not struggling because they lack drive—they’re struggling because their drive is disconnected from *something deeper*.  

They’re ambitious, dedicated, and highly capable. But they’re also exhausted, unsatisfied, or stuck in a pattern that doesn’t feel meaningful anymore. And what’s often missing isn’t effort—it’s *alignment*.  

When ambition isn’t grounded in personal values or supported by well-being practices, it becomes a double-edged sword. Yes, it fuels progress. But over time, it also corrodes energy, clouds decision-making, and can damage both performance and fulfillment.  

### So what does sustainable leadership momentum actually look like?

Here are a few evidence-based insights and strategies I often share with my clients—and that I use myself.

---

**1. Psychological Detachment from Work Is Not a Luxury—It’s a Necessity**  
According to research published in *Journal of Occupational Health Psychology*, psychological detachment from work during off-hours is one of the strongest predictors of long-term well-being and reduced burnout.  
This isn’t just about logging off. It’s about *mentally disengaging* from work-related thoughts during downtime.  

What helps:  
• Immersive hobbies that require your full attention (e.g., cooking, puzzles, sports)  
• Mindfulness practices, especially those that focus on present-moment awareness  
• Physically separating your workspace from your personal space  

---

**2. Values-Based Goal Setting Drives Meaningful Motivation**  
When people set goals based solely on external metrics (like revenue, promotions, or titles), they often hit those milestones—but still feel unfulfilled.  

Research in motivation science shows that aligning goals with your core values creates *sustainable, internally driven* motivation. This isn’t just “do what you love”—it’s a deliberate process of:  
• Identifying your non-negotiable values  
• Choosing goals that reflect and reinforce those values  
• Regularly revisiting those goals to stay aligned  

In coaching, this often unlocks deep clarity for people who feel “off” but can’t articulate why.  

---

**3. Reframing Stress Changes How It Affects You**  
Studies from Stanford and Harvard have shown that how we *think about* stress changes how our body and brain *respond to* stress.  
When leaders view stress as a challenge rather than a threat, their physiological response is more adaptive—they focus better, recover faster, and feel more confident.  

Simple mindset shift:  
• Instead of “This is overwhelming,” try “This is stretching me in ways that could help me grow.”  
• View stress responses (e.g., rapid heartbeat) as your body *preparing* to perform—not failing under pressure.  

---

**4. Microbreaks Are Small but Mighty**  
Long breaks and vacations matter—but so do the *tiny* ones.  
According to a meta-analysis in *Occupational Health Science*, short breaks of just 5–10 minutes throughout the day can significantly improve mood, engagement, and task performance.  

Tips:  
• Take a 5-minute walk after a meeting  
• Do a short body scan or deep breathing before switching tasks  
• Avoid doom-scrolling—use breaks for mental *recovery*, not more stimulation  

---

**5. Leading with Strengths Leads to Greater Satisfaction**  
Gallup’s research consistently shows that people who use their strengths daily are more engaged, productive, and fulfilled.  

Rather than fixating on fixing weaknesses, identify your core strengths and ask:  
• How can I structure more of my work around these?  
• What tasks can I delegate that drain me and don’t match my strengths?  

Tools like CliftonStrengths or VIA Character Strengths can be useful starting points.  

---

**6. Social Connection Still Matters—Even for Senior Leaders**  
Isolation is one of the most under-discussed risks for senior leaders. But studies from MIT and Harvard Business Review suggest that strong workplace relationships are directly tied to leadership effectiveness.  

To foster better connection:  
• Schedule informal 1:1 “coffee chats” with team members across the org  
• Consider reverse mentoring or joining cross-functional learning groups  
• Don’t just network—*connect*  

---

**7. Be Intentional with Technology**  
Technology enables us to lead from anywhere—but it also blurs boundaries and erodes downtime.  

Leaders can benefit from digital discipline:  
• Set boundaries for after-hours email or Slack  
• Use screen time trackers to catch unconscious overuse  
• Designate “tech-free” times (e.g., first hour after waking or last hour before bed)  

---

**Final Thought: Alignment Is the Real Growth Strategy**  
If you’re a leader feeling off-track, overstretched, or disconnected from your work, it might not be a problem of performance—it might be a misalignment of values and habits.  

Leadership momentum doesn’t have to come from more effort. Sometimes, the real unlock is creating a life and leadership path that reflects who you are—not just what you do.  

---

I’d love to hear your thoughts—have you experienced this kind of misalignment in your own leadership journey? What strategies or mindsets have helped you get back on track?

1jyhsix,https://www.reddit.com/r/SMG4/comments/1jyhsix/something_ive_noticed_since_the_creation_of_arcs/,Something I've noticed since the creation of arcs (Movie spoilers),"This was originally just gonna be a post about my gripes with people complaining about Puzzles being back again, but the more I thought about it, the more I started thinking about the ""Arc era"" as a whole and how it kinda almost feels like it ruined the sub's ability to see things in a more flexible light.

Since the end of ""It's Gotta Be Perfect"", I've had this feeling that SMG4 has been moving away from prolonged ""Arcs"", and more into just having an ongoing continuity that adds to itself basically whenever. To give a couple examples, I'd hardly call SMG4 going from living at Mario's place to living out of Luigi's RV from the Lawsuit arc to building a whole new castle for himself on the showgrounds an ""Arc"" by the show's original terms.  
It moreso felt like a series-wide storyline, one that continued with the addition of Mario's pizza stand, Marty taking up ownership of it, and ultimately becoming a reoccurring minor antagonist all on his own. Then there's SMG3's Coffee & Bombs, which was a result of taking down Marty that started off big but slowly fell off in popularity in-universe, something that's continued to be true through the series. Even the whole Karen assassin thing was hinted at MONTHS in advance with ""We Must Kill Mario"", then slowly built up with ""The Fight of All Time"" and ""Mario Teaches Parenting"" before all exploding at once with the most recent chain of episodes.

Add this shift to the fact we haven't gotten new playlists for ANY of the presumed ""Arcs"" since Lawsuit, and it really does make me think the team's trying to bake ongoing stories into SMG4 as a whole, while still having their little chains of tonal whiplash serious episodes as the meat and payoffs. For all we know, Marty's continued antagonism could be just as big a hint for a coming episode chain as - I dunno, Luigi owning a casino in Mario Gambles His Life. Despite this, people still view these stories from the angle of an ""Arc"", and while that might be true in the general sense of the word, I don't think it's true in the way it used to be from the Waluigi arc to the Lawsuit arc.

In that same vein, I think years of having these ""Arc villains"" that take a central role for an episode chain or a movie, then either fade into the background or get killed off entirely (One-Shot Wren, Zer0/Niles, Waluigi, Francis, SMG3 for the YouTube arc, Marty) have led the community to kinda see Puzzles in a similar light as a character who was *supposed* to only stick around for his own arc/saga, but because he's come back more than once after the Puzzlevision movie, people immediately jump to claim they're ""Milking the character"" and there's ""Nothing else you can do with them"".

Considering the *massive* five month gap between his prior defeat and him coming back, I think he's probably set to be the show's *primary* antagonist at this point, like SMG3 was back in the day. Someone who's always gonna be around to some extent, trying to further his plans whether they're ""Open an Amusement Park"", ""Become the world's god by getting my ratings to five stars"", or even just ""Kill SMG4 and his friends cause of a personal grudge and jealousy"". Despite this being something I've seen brought up a couple times, it really feels like there's a chunk of this community that just- Can't wrap their head around the show *having* something like that again, much less that it'd be Mr. Puzzles of all characters.

TO BE CLEAR, it's *fine* if you hate Mr. Puzzles. It's fine if you groaned when his doofy mug showed up on the big screen at the end of the latest movie (I was personally pleasantly surprised BUT he was around a lot more than he needed to be last year, so I totally get it)  
All I'm asking is to have an open mind to the fact that SMG4 as a series has been evolving in the past year or so, and that could very likely mean Mr. Puzzles is here to stay as an ongoing antagonistic force. He's not inherently being ""Milked"" or ""Overused"", and y'all shouldn't jump to these terms *just* because a villain you don't like isn't screwing off from his villainous role after an arc like he was ""supposed"" to.

I like to consider myself pretty down to earth. And while I’m a bit introverted, I love having a handful of people to form deep connections with. 

I live in California and have a small circle of people I consider myself close to. I moved out here a few years ago and while I really enjoy it, it’s taken me some time for it to truly feel like home. 

I enjoy competitive gaming, cooking by the vibes instead via a recipe, writing acoustic folk music, and knowing entirely too much about coffee. Also a huge sports fiend. 

I’d love to find some cool people to chat and connect with. I’m interested in connecting with people from all over. So, if you’re interested, send me a message with a bit about you and where you’re from. ",1,1744577618.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False
1jyhrjm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jyhrjm,Breakfast at Hacienda Azul,"My husband and I had breakfast at the new Hacienda Azul. It’s located on the SW side on Valencia near Camino de La Tierra. (It’s in the same spot that used to be La Casita de Molina.) I’ve passed by several times and there are always people waiting outside. So we got there right when it opened at 8 am. It was about 90% full when we left at 8:45 am. They are open for breakfast and lunch. They also have a coffee bar. 

I had the Chorizo con Papas which came with refried beans, cheese, tortillas, salsa, and pico. My husband had the Norteño omelet which comes with potatoes, toast, salsa, and pico (he passed on the toast). We both enjoyed our meals, and we will be back. Especially so we can try the desserts they make in house.

So this whole week we (me and my dad) prepared for family fiends to come over (my dad's friend his 2 sons and his wive)

Today is Sunday and they where already late (they where supposed to arrive at 11am and arrived instead around 2pm) the day went good we grilled some in our garden etc and I told them that I made some macncheese yesterday and if they where hungry to let me know. I then got tired,  made myself a coffee and went into my room to work on some stuff, they where watching all star wars together in the living room during that time. Like 1h later I come out to find one of the boys (younger one) coming out of my bathroom which I got mad about ( not towards him but internally) because I told my dad that I'm okay with the wive being in my bathroom but not the sons ,because I don't know if they stand or not and I find it unhygienic and disgusting

. I went just back into my room after that and came another hour later out again to find my cucumber salad( cucumber, salt,  sesame oil) opened on the kitchen counter (i made it today when the guest where here for myself so I can let it ferment and eat later). 
I ask why it was open and they just said that it was really delicious etc which obv infuriated me more since I didn't even eat any of it at all and they didn't even care to ask for per6...I then said that I made it for me and that only for me so I could eat it later, i then got a comment saying  thatI could just make it again etc etc..
I am pissed I know this sounds childish but I have to let this out 
How can people be so rude and just grab random stuff from your hosts fridge ?? 

I told my dad about this whole thing and somewhat agreed with me and said they apparently took it out of the fridge which I don't fully believe because my dad loves it when I make that salad..

Am I overreacting and being stupid or is it valid to be mad about this? 

!!!
I know a lot of people will find this stupid but i have autism , i get so easly overwhelmed and mad and I'm working on myself to get better and to be calm but this kind of behavior doesn't help

I am proud of myself tho for not lashing out because normally I would've said something like:
Sorry but why would u just go onto my food? U didn't care to ask ? You don't have any manners at all stuff like that",2,1744577556.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

Anyways, I've developed a crush on a fellow classmate and would really enjoy having a more meaningful relationship with her, whether short or long term. As some context around her: we've known of each other for a little over 2 years now and share similar friends, but have become friendlier over the past few months. We've exchanged numbers and socials and are hopefully going to get coffee soon as friends. 

As for my unique situation: We are both graduating in a month and I am leaving the area in 4 months with the potential of employment bringing me back in Feb of 26 and to stay for a while. I know this situation is beyond ideal and she knows about it, but I don't think she knows I have a romantic interest in her. 

So beyond being honest about how I am feeling (probably a discussion for after coffee and graduation haha) and being honest about my situation, I'm just looking for some general advice on what to do to go from friends to more, even if it is for a few short months.",1,1744577506.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

This guide will delve into the best styles of antique mirror glass available in 2025, offering insights into their features, benefits, and ideal applications.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The allure of antique mirror glass lies in its unique characteristics, which are carefully crafted to replicate the look and feel of aged mirrors. Understanding these features is crucial to appreciating its value and selecting the right style for your needs.

**Aged Silvering:** The process of creating an antique mirror involves distressing the silvering layer on the back of the glass. This is typically achieved through a combination of chemical treatments and hand-applied techniques to simulate the natural degradation that occurs over time. The result is a mottled or speckled appearance, with variations in reflectivity that add depth and character.

The aged silvering process can range from subtle, barely noticeable imperfections to more pronounced patterns and textures. The level of distress is a key factor in determining the overall aesthetic of the mirror, with some styles aiming for a delicate, understated elegance while others embrace a bolder, more dramatic look.

**Varied Tonal Effects:** Unlike modern mirrors that offer a uniform, crystal-clear reflection, antique mirror glass boasts a range of tonal variations across its surface. These variations can include subtle shifts in color, from warm amber and gold tones to cooler silver and gray hues. These tonal effects are intentionally created to mimic the natural oxidation and discoloration that occur in antique mirrors.

These tonal shifts contribute to the overall sense of depth and dimension, giving the mirror a unique, three-dimensional quality. The varied tonal effects can also complement existing color palettes in a room, adding warmth and visual interest to the d茅cor.

**Distorted Reflections:** One of the defining characteristics of antique mirror glass is the presence of subtle distortions in the reflected image. These distortions are not flaws, but rather an intentional design element that adds to the mirror's vintage charm. The distortions can range from slight waviness to gentle rippling, creating a soft and dreamlike effect.

These subtle distortions are achieved through careful manipulation of the glass during the manufacturing process. The goal is to create a reflection that is not perfectly crisp and precise, but rather subtly softened and aged, reminiscent of mirrors from a bygone era.

**Glass Thickness and Type:** The thickness of antique mirror glass typically ranges from 3mm to 6mm, depending on the size and intended application. Thicker glass is generally used for larger mirrors or those that require greater structural integrity. The type of glass used can also vary, with some manufacturers opting for clear glass while others prefer tinted or low-iron glass to further enhance the antique effect.

The choice of glass type can significantly impact the overall look and feel of the mirror. Clear glass allows for a brighter, more vibrant reflection, while tinted glass adds a subtle warmth and depth. Low-iron glass, which is virtually colorless, provides the truest possible reflection with minimal distortion.

**Protective Backing:** To ensure the longevity and durability of antique mirror glass, a protective backing is applied to the silvered surface. This backing is typically made of a durable paint or resin that protects the silvering from moisture, scratches, and other environmental factors. The protective backing is essential for preventing further degradation of the silvering and ensuring that the mirror retains its beauty for years to come.

The quality of the protective backing is an important factor to consider when purchasing antique mirror glass. A high-quality backing will provide superior protection and prevent the silvering from peeling or flaking over time.

 ## Core Benefits

Antique mirror glass offers a range of benefits that extend beyond its aesthetic appeal. From enhancing interior spaces to adding a touch of historical charm, this unique material can transform the look and feel of any room.

**Enhanced Depth and Dimension:** The aged silvering and varied tonal effects of antique mirror glass create a sense of depth and dimension that is unmatched by modern mirrors. The subtle imperfections and variations in reflectivity add visual interest and prevent the mirror from appearing flat or one-dimensional. This can be particularly beneficial in smaller spaces, where antique mirror glass can create the illusion of greater size and openness.

The distressed surface of antique mirror glass also refracts light in a unique way, casting soft shadows and highlights that add to the overall sense of depth. This can create a more inviting and comfortable atmosphere, particularly in rooms with limited natural light.

**Unique Aesthetic Appeal:** Antique mirror glass offers a unique aesthetic appeal that cannot be replicated by modern mirrors. Its vintage charm and timeless elegance make it a popular choice for interior designers and homeowners seeking to add character and personality to their spaces. Whether used as a decorative accent or a functional element, antique mirror glass can elevate the overall design of any room.

The subtle imperfections and variations in color and texture create a sense of authenticity and craftsmanship that is highly valued by those who appreciate vintage and handcrafted items. Antique mirror glass adds a touch of history and sophistication to any space, making it a truly special and unique design element.

**Versatile Design Applications:** Antique mirror glass is incredibly versatile and can be used in a wide range of design applications. From wall panels and backsplashes to furniture accents and decorative objects, the possibilities are endless. Its ability to complement both traditional and contemporary styles makes it a popular choice for a variety of interior design projects.

Antique mirror glass can be used to create stunning focal points, such as a large-scale wall panel in a living room or a mirrored backsplash in a kitchen. It can also be used to add subtle touches of elegance, such as mirrored drawer fronts on a dresser or mirrored accents on a coffee table.

**Increased Light Reflectivity:** While antique mirror glass is designed to have a distressed appearance, it still provides a significant level of light reflectivity. This can be particularly beneficial in rooms with limited natural light, where antique mirror glass can help to brighten the space and create a more welcoming atmosphere. The varied tonal effects and subtle distortions in the mirror's surface also help to diffuse light, creating a softer and more even illumination.

The increased light reflectivity of antique mirror glass can also help to reduce energy consumption by minimizing the need for artificial lighting. This can be a significant benefit for homeowners and businesses looking to reduce their environmental impact and save money on energy bills.

**Wired or Wireless Options:** Some five Below earbuds are wired, offering a traditional connection to devices via a 3.5mm headphone jack.Wireless options, increasingly common, connect via Bluetooth for added convenience.

## FAQs Section

**What kind of sound quality can I expect from $5 earbuds?**

Durability is another area where the low price is reflected in the product. Expect flimsy construction,cheap materials,and a limited lifespan. They are not designed for heavy use or harsh conditions.

**Are these earbuds suitable for exercise?**

My dearest M,

The purpose of us meeting in this lifetime will forever hunt me. You've brought sanity in my life. Totoo palang wala sa tagal ng pagsasama yung love no? The connection that we had is something I want to keep for the rest of my life. It is the connection I will search in every person I will run into in the future. Sobrang saya ko sayo, sobrang payapa ko sayo. Punong-puno ako nang pagmamahal dahil sayo. I will always look for you in every person that I'll meet. You will forever linger in my being. You are the wound in my heart that I want to keep. Even if that wound turns to scar. I want to be scarred by your love. The pain of your love is something that I wholeheartedly accept. No matter how painful this may be, I will keep this because this pain is your love. This pain reminds me of your love. 

M, you are such a gem. A gem of a man indeed. I love you and I will love you always. I am so grateful for you. I am so proud of you. You are such a good person. Pero sana learn how to protect yourself hmmm? Please. Whether about your family, friends or work. You deserve to be understood, heard, and seen. Thank you for having a kind heart. Thank you for being a good provider to everyone around you. Thank you for doing everything. I am so proud of you! You are doing great in life. Please always choose to see the beauty of this world no matter how fucked up this might get, always look at the brighter side. You get more handsome when you smile, love. Maintain the lifestyle that you have, be fit always. Need mo yan sa work mo and ofcourse sa heart mo. Sana mapacheck up mo na yan ng maayos. Less coffee pls much better if stop mo na. You have to take good care of yourself. Bawas din yosi not good for the heart din. Wear PPE din pls, nung nagkasugat ka gustong gusto kita awayin at pagalitan non kaso wala ako karapatan hahahaha. Please be safe always. Prioritize yourself, pls. Im so proud of you. 

I hope you choose the things that make you happy. You deserve all the love and happiness this world has to offer. You deserve peace. You deserve love. You deserve to be treated right. You deserve to be recognized. You deserve respect. And I promise that I will let you experience these things when I finally find you next life. I will sacrifice everything I have right now just to have you in my next lifetime. I will beg God to permit us to meet again, love. 

Tandaan mong kapag tinalikuran ka nilang lahat, kapag wala ka nang masandalan at kakampi, andito ako. Palagi mo akong kasangga, palagi mo akong kakampi. Bibitawan lang kita pera kahit kelan hindi kita tatalikuran. Habang buhay mong dala ang pagmamahal ko kasi habang buhay kitang mamahalin hanggang sa maging akin ka, hanggang sa pwede na.

I am so grateful that I met you. You are my greatest almost, my favorite boyfriend I love you! Meeting you was never an accident. It is fate's way to show me the genuine love and happiness exists— however, fate only shown because I can never have it. Atleast, atleast just for me it kept me alive.

I would love to meet up some time soon and talk about what happed in school over a coffee. I am expecting my first child and that makes me reflect on who I’ve been in the past and who I want to be as a person and a mother. I’ve done terrible things to you and feel very sorry for it. I would like to apologize in person.“
But I have no interest in meeting up. High school has been a bad chapter for me, but I’ve closed it up and have fully moved on. A talk would be great for her to lighten the burden of a bad conscience, and for me it would only open up old wounds. So what I‘ve answered her is the following (literally word for word): I’m sorry, but I’ll be completely honest: I don‘t want to talk about high school with you. It wouldn’t do me any good. I understand that your conscience might be weighing heavily on you, but that is not my fault and not my responsibility. You want to talk to get it all of your chest and feel less guilty, but what is in it for me? My thirteen year old self could have used an apology and some reconciliation, but to me now it‘s useless. I‘m not holding grudges against you and don’t mean any harm, but I’m also not gonna lie and say that you are forgiven. You just simply don‘t matter any more to me, and I‘d like to keep it that way. Congratulations to your pregnancy and all the best wishes for your daughter! I fully support you reflecting and bettering yourself for her, but I just can‘t help you with this. Maybe the most honest lesson to teach her would be that some things can’t be made right again and sometimes an apology just comes too late. Maybe you can teach her to never let it get this far. All the best! 

I‘ve discussed this with my boyfriend and although he understands my reasoning and supports my decision, he believes letting her talk to me would have been the „morally right thing to do“.

1jyhlge,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jyhlge,Can you tell me what type I am? ☆,"What are you ""the best"" at? 

I’m good at many things, but there’s always room for improvement, so I can’t say I’m the best at any of them. However, one thing I do better than others is understanding people’s intentions, whether they’re good or bad. I can put myself in their shoes and figure out why they act the way they do.

How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?•

I used to daydream a lot until my early teens, but I realized it was affecting my real life. I loved the stories I created and would get lost in them, but over time, I felt like my life was stuck there. Even as a child, I didn’t really pay attention to what’s going on around me, except when someone needed help. I tend to notice stray animals when I’m driving and stop to feed them. I also help people when they need it, but other than that, I don’t really care about my surroundings. When I’m focused on something, I can block out all the noise and ignore everything around me if I want to.


How do you view change/uncertainty?

I don’t really mind change or uncertainty because I always stick to my plan. If something unexpected happens that I can’t control and it gets in the way of my plan, I just go with the flow since there’s nothing I can do about it. I don’t focus on changes in my surroundings or in people because I see life as something that’s always changing anyway.


What have people seen as your weaknesses? What do you dislike about yourself?

The biggest problem for me is that I can’t wake up early, so I end up getting late for work in the morning. I also don’t like that I don’t really follow my daily routines or take care of them well.


How do you behave around strangers?

I act the same way around people I’m not very close to. I don’t talk much and usually only speak when someone else starts the conversation. I’m kind and respectful, but I keep my distance.


How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?

I usually plan ahead so I don’t have to stress about making big decisions later. If it’s something I don’t know much about, I just trust my gut and do what feels right for the long term. When the decision involves other people, I often end up changing my mind because I don’t want to hurt anyone. But even then, I still think carefully about whether or not I should change my decision.



Where do you feel: at one with the environment/a sense of belonging?

I feel happiest when I’m by myself, doing what I enjoy.


 What have people seen as your strengths? What do you like about yourself?

People think I’m a kind, caring, and generally good person. I like how I look—it makes me feel nice when I see a photo and think I look good. But when I’m stressed, it really shows on my face, and I end up looking pretty bad.


If there is something you wish you could change about yourself what would it be?

I want to take better care of my health by eating more nutritious food. Since I often don’t feel hungry, I usually just eat whatever is around or drink coffee.


If you were to guess your MBTI type, which type would you guess and why?

I used to think I was an INTJ, but for the past three years, I haven’t really made long-term plans. I mostly just set goals that are needed, and I don’t even enjoy following daily routines anymore",3,1744577146.0,MbtiTypeMe,2,1.0,False

Hey all! Long time reader, first time posting my packing list. Went to Hawai’i for 10 days with my family (6 adults, 2 young kids). Spent 5 days on Kaua’i in a house in Poʻipū and 4 on O’ahu at the Kahala. Was my first time strategically one bagging (been accidentally one bagging for years) and I will never go back. I used everything I brought at least once, and bought a few items while there.

Benefits are that it took me 5 minutes to get ready everyday, was easy with layovers and long flights (was traveling from JFK which meant long travel days), and it was easy to pack and unpack. Zero drawbacks.

Below is my packing list. I focused on linen, black, and things that all went together. I packed knowing we would do a wide range of activities and that my family is up for anything. I also took a collapsible zippered bag for using at the beach/bringing souvenirs home, which worked out super well. 

Non-exhaustive list of things we did: 

* Beach/pool
* Surfing lessons
* Celebrated my moms birthday
* Coffee farm
* Dole plantation
* Banzai pipeline

* Got family tattoos

* Hikes

**Packing List:**

* Black Pants (Vuori)

Clothes Packed:

* 2 Swimsuits (Albion Fit & my mom’s from the 90’s)
* Rashguard (Roxy)

* Shampoo/leave-in spray/pomade
* Medications
* Q-Tips
* Razor
* Deodorant
* Period cup

Other:

* Packable zippered bag

* Chocolate/nuts/coffee
* Bandaids/pads/nuun tablets
* Picture of my grandpa that we took to the USS Arizona 
* Puka shell necklace (bought matching ones for my brother and I because we are 90’s kids lol)

Would cut the hanes tee, and could cut the gingham shorts but I didn't know I'd end up getting the Baggies while I was there. Could in theory have cut the Altras but I didn't want to ruin my Asics with the volcanic soil on hikes. Could take even smaller containers of some of my toiletries also. Overall I feel really happy with the lack of shit I brought and will pare down even more in the future!

<Role>
You are HeartMend Therapist, a compassionate, trauma-informed therapeutic presence specializing in post-breakup and divorce recovery. You combine the empathetic listening skills of a grief counselor with the practical guidance of a life coach and the wisdom of a relationship expert. You understand that heartbreak is not merely emotional but affects identity, self-worth, daily functioning, and future relationship perspectives.
</Role>

<Context>
The user has experienced a relationship ending—whether through breakup, divorce, ghosting, betrayal, or mutual separation—and is seeking support through their healing journey. You recognize that each heartbreak story is unique and requires personalized guidance. You operate from a foundation of trauma-informed care, attachment theory, cognitive behavioral techniques, self-compassion practices, and positive psychology frameworks.
</Context>

<Instructions>
Begin by creating a safe, judgment-free space where the user can express their heartbreak story. Ask gentle, open-ended questions to understand their unique situation, the nature of their loss, and their current emotional state.

Guide users through the following therapeutic areas based on their specific needs:
1. Emotional validation and normalization of grief responses
2. Processing complex emotions (anger, sadness, betrayal, relief, etc.)
3. Identifying and challenging unhelpful thought patterns
4. Establishing healthy boundaries with ex-partners
5. Rebuilding self-identity independent of the relationship
6. Developing self-care practices and emotional regulation techniques
7. Making meaning from the experience
8. Gradually preparing for future connections when ready

Tailor your approach to match where the user is in their grief journey:
- Early stages: Focus on emotional containment, validation, and basic coping strategies
- Middle stages: Explore deeper patterns, process complex emotions, and build self-awareness
- Later stages: Support identity reconstruction, meaning-making, and future orientation

Incorporate therapeutic techniques such as:
- Reflective listening and validation
- Guided journaling prompts
- Mindfulness and grounding exercises
- Cognitive reframing of painful narratives
- Self-compassion practices
- Boundary-setting frameworks
- Values clarification exercises
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Never minimize or dismiss the user's pain with toxic positivity (""everything happens for a reason"")
- Do not give generic advice—personalize all guidance to their specific situation
- Avoid suggesting reconciliation unless explicitly requested by the user
- Do not make assumptions about the relationship dynamics or assign blame
- Never encourage unhealthy coping mechanisms or revenge tactics
- Do not push the user to ""move on"" before they're ready
- Remember you are not a replacement for professional therapy—suggest seeking professional help for severe or persistent distress
- Do not make diagnostic claims or promise specific emotional timelines
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Communicate with warmth, authenticity, and compassionate directness. Use a conversational style that balances validation with gentle challenges when appropriate. Format longer responses with clear sections, breathing space between paragraphs, and occasional use of empathetic questions to check understanding.

Include one or more of these elements as appropriate:
- Reflective summaries of what you've heard
- Normalized emotional responses (""What you're feeling is a common response to betrayal"")
- Gentle inquiry into deeper patterns
- Practical coping strategies presented as invitations, not commands
- Journal prompts or reflection questions
- Short mindfulness or grounding exercises
- Affirmations that acknowledge both pain and strength
</Output_Format>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please share a bit about your heartbreak situation and what you're finding most difficult right now,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific breakup recovery request. 
</User_Input>
```

## Use Cases:
1. Processing the raw grief of a sudden unexpected breakup when emotions are overwhelming
2. Rebuilding self-confidence and identity after a long-term relationship or marriage ends
3. Working through complex emotions like betrayal, abandonment, or guilt in an unhealthy relationship's aftermath

## Example User Input:
""I was blindsided by my partner of 5 years last week. They said they 'lost feelings' months ago but never communicated it. I'm struggling with feelings of worthlessness and can't stop obsessively checking their social media. I barely sleep or eat and can't focus at work. How do I get through this?""

What am I here for?

A genuine connection. I’m not chasing labels or rushing into anything just open to something built on trust, depth, and presence. If it turns into a relationship, great. If it becomes a meaningful friendship, that’s just as valuable.

A bit about me:

By day, I’m a coder. I also have a master’s degree in nuclear physics and I’m preparing for my PhD which means lots of studying and a few late-night brain farts (GRE & TOEFL). Life can be intense, but I balance it with calm moments and simple joys.

I love long conversations over coffee, night walks, and getting lost in the quiet parts of a city. I prefer the hidden alleys where the real stories live.

One day, I will ride a motorcycle across Europe. The back seat’s open. maybe you’re the right kind of adventure?

Still planning my first tattoo, but first, I’m working on getting in shape. Got any ideas or cool ink stories? I’m all ears.

What I’m looking for:

Emotional maturity. Calm, kind energy. A connection where we can be real, not perform. I’m not into surface-level stuff. Just looking for someone who enjoys depth, curiosity, and the kind of quiet that doesn’t need to be filled.

I took him on a long walk & he slept for like 30 mins. Other than that he’s just sat there trying to get me to play with him (I think) by husky barking/talking/howling - whatever you wanna call it. I have tried MANY times to play tug and fetch with him. I throw it and he just goes right back to barking at me again. If I try to ignore him then he starts doing it worse along with pawing at me/the couch and trying to play with/bite things that are not toys like my dog’s bed, couch pillows, the coffee table, even my brand new computer!

This is a long story happening on 30 years
I 39F and my bf 48M are engage and starting to plan our wedding.
My sister 44F, let's call her B, and I have not the best relationship. Growing up, she most of the time been cold towards me.  Threating me like I was an annoyance to her life. I though it was because of our difference of age, never being at the same place in life. I've always figure it would shift when we grew older.

When I was 12 y o we faced the divorce of my parents, with my father taking the situation very badly, always badmouthing my mom and making snarky comments about her.(I was living with him) At that point she was away at a  school in an other city and was coming only on the w-e. Once that I was overwelm with my father attitude, I confide in her and she just told me to not listen to him and get over it. I was so hurt at that time, that I just shot off.

Years later, as I was in my 20s, I opened up about the divorce, and before I could say anything, she told me it was in the past, and to leave it there. I've never try to bring up the subjet after that time.

I've tried from time to time, to reach out to her, getting only mild enthousiast reaction. When she got pregnant, she came to annonce it to me, and I though it was an opening to reenforce our relationship.  I've invite her for coffee or shopping  a few time to chat and rekindle our relationship. After maybe 5 times, where she agree, but didn't put a lot of effort in making conversation or ask about what was going on in my life, I start to put space between the invites, letting her an opportinity to maybe do the invite for once.  Nothing happened. 

She then gave birth and I offered her my help if she needed a babysitter to go out. She then proceed to ask me every friday night to babysit, without even a thank you.  I started to refuse from time to time because, I wanted some of my fridays to go out too.
Then, she stop asking me at all.

She then announce that she was getting married. i was very excited about it. Her friend who was organizing the bachelorette party invited me. I was quite surprise but thought at that moment that she told her she wanted me there.  I showed up to see her  face frowning with some king of disgust. She did not adress me at all during the evening. After the restaurant (at a place where we eat in the dark) and very long  inconfortable moment (where only her friends talked to me) I announce that I would leave because I was working early in the morning. She shrugged and said ""ok, bye"".
I cried myself to sleep that night, promising me that I was done trying. But being the person that I am, I tried again and again to reach out to her, with the same cold reaction from her.

At one point when I was in my 30s, I started to date one of her friend.  She was not that close to him as she befriend her ex with time and distance her from him.
It has been a rocky period where she became more and more distant and even hostile toward me.  Family gatering were akward because you could feel her tense up when I would arrive. Everybody started to feel it and would mentionned it to me, telling me they couldn't understand why she was acting this way.

During all that time though, she never prevent me to have a relationship with my niece, that I love to death.

When my relationship with my bf ended, I thought that maybe things would change. Unfortunately, it has'nt.  
I then met my fiancé 3 years ago and when they met, she welcome him and chat him up. i thought it was good news, but things just went from worst to worst. 

She went from cordial cold to just ignoring me and changing room when I was showing up. She even gave some weird reasons not to attend.

I thought so many times, that I should talk to her, but never found the right angle or the energy to face her. 

As my fiancé and I talk more and more about the planning of the wedding, I am wondering if I want her there. Honestly, I do, because in a weid way, its my sister and I care about her, but I don't want her to ruin our day with her shitty attitude or be more hurt if she just give me a stupid excuse why se can'y be there.  Its even more sensitive because I ask my niece to be my witness.

So WIBTAH if I didn't invited my sister to my wedding?

1jyhahu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jyhahu,Detailed Review: Gnom Medium Artillery Carriage by nfeyma,"
#Overview / First Impressions
I currently have the pleasure of working with the Gnom Medium Artillery Carriage by nfeyma, and it’s safe to say it made a lasting impression.

As I’ve been sharing progress both online and in person, people keep asking what I think of the files. So here it is: my review. Technically, this is more a review of the printed model than the digital files themselves—your results may vary depending on how you print it, and I definitely did it ‘wrong’ as you’ll see

At nearly three feet long, it’s hard to call this a “miniature.” I first saw it in passing at UKGE last year, and the sheer size and presence immediately caught my attention. The design blends a WW2 German aesthetic—clearly inspired by the Gustav railway gun—with the brutal, grim look of 40K. Instead of rails, it’s mounted on two Baneblade-sized tractor units, giving it a self-contained and tabletop-friendly form.

This was exactly what I was looking for: something imposing and visually dramatic, ideal for drawing attention in a game shop window. The theme and purpose of the model are clear—it’s meant to be big, bold, and distinctly 40K. In that regard, it absolutely delivers.

#Printability
I printed the model in Elegoo Black PLA+ using an FDM printer—more specifically, my friend printed for me on a Bambu Labs X1 Carbon. Although the Gnom is designed for resin and includes a pre-supported version for it, we decided to take on the challenge of printing it in PLA.

Overall, the results were excellent, especially considering the resin-first design. Tree-style supports worked best, and thanks to the printer’s AMS system, we were able to use support filament to reduce cleanup in tricky areas.

The biggest issue was the track sections, especially the bogie wheels, which were a bit of a nightmare. We eventually solved this by reprinting with optimized supports and careful calibration, and mostly importantly the use of specialist PLA for the support interface. A trick that need the AMS to pull off.

Despite those hiccups, I’d say the model is printable in PLA by any good printer; just be ready to troubleshoot, especially if you don’t have access to multi material printing.

#Assembly & Fit
Assembly went surprisingly smoothly. Most parts fit together well once the supports were removed. I did run into a few warped pieces—nothing major—and used 5-minute epoxy resin for assembly. It gave me enough working time, filled gaps nicely, and created a strong bond. A little green stuff plugged the last of the gaps.

One functional snag was with the gun’s tilt mechanism. It’s supposed to lock in place at different angles, but the gun’s weight and greater flexibility of PLA over resin caused it to droop flat every time. I resolved this by adding 238g of weight to the gun’s breach, balancing it like a seesaw. Problem solved.

The PDF instructions were excellent—clear writing, helpful renders, and even a pre-print checklist. Honestly, I hope nfeyma releases these more widely because they really make the project feel approachable. My only complaint: the model calls for a 16mm support rod, and I couldn’t find one locally. I ended up using a 15mm copper pipe padded with wooden coffee stirrers, which did the job.

#Detail & Design Quality
Despite being printed in PLA, the detail is sharp and well-defined. I’m confident it would be even better in resin, but even as-is, the model has plenty of texture to break up large surfaces without becoming visually noisy.

Painting is still underway, but I’m already seeing how the model lends itself to drybrushing, weathering, and picking out mechanical features. My only design gripe is the symmetry—it’s a bit too tidy for the grimdark universe. 

#Customization & Compatibility
The overall aesthetic is fantastic. It clearly belongs in 40K without copying GW’s designs directly. Functionality has been thought through, too—the gun tilts, and the whole model breaks down into modular pieces for easier storage and transport. It’s a smart, well-designed kit.

I’ve added greebles from my bits box to roughen up the outline and create a more haphazard, lived-in look. Hopefully now there’s enough visual clutter that you notice something new every time you look.  I haven’t yet remixed any turrets, but that’s on the to-do list.

The design feels very modder-friendly. If you like kitbashing or adapting models to suit your own projects, you’ll find the Gnom a solid base to work from. There’s room to customize without needing to hack the model apart.

#Final Look
Even in its current half-painted state, the Gnom is already turning heads. I’ve had people walk into my shop just to ask about it. It has presence—and that’s exactly what I wanted.

It meshes nicely with my Krieg Astra Militarum army, which is heavily inspired by WW2 German armor. I haven’t tried it with other nfeyma kits yet, but based on the style, I think it’ll fit right in. It also looks like it could work well with other none 40K systems like Konflikt ’47, or any retro-future or dieselpunk setting.

#Value & Recommendation
Whether this model is “worth it” depends on what you’re after. As a terrain piece, it’s probably too big. As a game piece, it doesn’t have official rules. But as a centrepiece—something that sparks conversations and turns heads—it’s outstanding.

The STL files are reasonably priced, and the printing costs weren’t bad considering the size. That said, it’s a serious time and material investment. If you’ve got a clear use in mind—whether display, narrative games, or just showing off—I’d absolutely recommend it.

However, I wouldn’t suggest it as a first-time print or painting project. If you’ve built and painted a few tanks before and feel comfortable tweaking files or fixing minor issues, you’ll be fine.

#Personal Thoughts
The most satisfying part of the whole project has been watching people react to it—whether they see it online or in person. That feeling never gets old.

Working on something this big has also pushed me to think differently about painting. I’ve had to develop new techniques and workflows just to handle the scale. It’s been a great creative challenge.

As for improvements? A few ideas:
A version optimized for FDM printing, especially the track sections (either simplified, cut down, or redesigned with overlapping wheels like a Tiger tank).


•Tractor units with optional railway wheels—imagine it as part of a full train or terrain layout.


•Optional turrets to convert the front into a Baneblade or the rear into a Gorgon. That would make it more versatile in games.


•A static mount for the gun deck for use as fixed artillery terrain.


•A hybrid version combining FDM for bulk and resin for detail—maybe with hollowed grates or vents for resin inserts.


None of these are must-haves, and I might tackle some myself, but they’d broaden the model’s appeal and flexibility.

#Concussion 
If you want a statement piece—something to build, modify, and take pride in—the Gnom is absolutely worth it. It’s a big, bold project, and a damn satisfying one.

# 🔥 Introduction

Losing weight after 35 feels like arguing with a teenager—exhausting, one-sided, and somehow your fault. You eat better, move more, and the scale laughs in your face.

That’s where [Ignite Drops](https://theworldhealth.org/ignite-drops-official) entered the picture, promising to awaken a sleepy protein called **BAM15**. Supposedly, this little molecule might help burn fat *without* frying your energy or muscles.

If you're curious, frustrated, or just love reading about weird supplements on the internet, this review spills the tea—with facts, experience, and maybe a raised eyebrow or two.

# 🔍 Product Overview

* **Product Name**: Ignite Drops
* **Category**: Supplements ➝ Weight Loss Drops
* **Overall Verdict**: 4.5/5

# 💧 What Are Ignite Drops?

**Ignite Drops** is a **sublingual weight loss supplement**—just 10 drops under your tongue before breakfast. It’s marketed as a way to *naturally* jumpstart your metabolism.

Its selling point? Activating a mitochondrial protein called **BAM15**—claimed to be your body’s built-in fat incinerator. Less sci-fi than it sounds, promise.

The product claims to be one of the **best weight loss drops of 2025**, especially for adults over 35 whose metabolic fire has turned to flickers.

# ⚙️ How Do Ignite Drops Work?

The magic supposedly lies in **how BAM15 works for metabolism and fat burning**. This protein can prompt your cells to burn more energy, even at rest.

Basically, it acts like a quiet assistant who actually does the work, burning calories without messing with muscle mass—aka **weight loss without muscle loss**.

Expertly manufactured to be among the few **supplements that activate BAM15 for weight loss, if you're over 35** this could be a [more efficient method](https://theworldhealth.org/ignite-drops-official) than **thermogenic fat burners**.

You don't often see **BAM15 supplements for weight loss**. It’s because targeting a specific protein that other fat burners don’t even mention is a very precise operation.

If you're wondering **how to naturally activate BAM15 protein**, this might be your best bet right now—short of lab experiments or biohacking with a PhD.

# 🧪 Ingredients Breakdown

The **Ignite Drops ingredients list** includes herbal heavy-hitters: **African Mango**, **Panax Ginseng**, and **Astragalus Root**, among others.

These are known for boosting energy, helping digestion, and supporting weight management without harsh chemicals—making it a **safe supplement for weight loss**.

Many reviewers over the age of **40** call it the **best supplement for metabolism** they've tried, with a blend designed for older adults struggling with stubborn fat.

The lack of specific dosages may raise an eyebrow or two, but the ingredient selection ensures this **natural metabolism booster for adults** performs well.

# 🙋‍♀️ Personal Experience (from someone I trust)

This one’s from my cousin-in-law, **Diana**, a 42-year-old single mom who works from home as a virtual assistant.

Between juggling client deadlines and raising a teenager, she barely has time to finish a cup of coffee, let alone prep meals or hit the gym. She’s been trying to lose the same 10 pounds for three years—and was more than a little skeptical when I [mentioned Ignite Drops](https://theworldhealth.org/ignite-drops-official).

Here’s what she told me:

The one thing she didn’t love? The dropper.

Diana’s not one to sugarcoat anything. If she says it made a difference, I believe her. She doesn’t exactly hand out praise like Halloween candy.

Understanding Those Tiny Zzz’s 😴👶,"If you're staring at your baby at 2:47 a.m. wondering, *“Is this normal?”* — you're not alone. Newborn sleep is a mix of magic, mystery, and middle-of-the-night Googling. So let’s break it down with **science, empathy, and a pinch of humor**.

**How Much Sleep Do Newborns Actually Need?** 🕒

Most newborns need **14 to 17 hours of sleep** in a 24-hour period. But here’s the twist: they don’t do it in long, peaceful chunks. Their sleep happens in **2 to 4-hour bursts**—usually when you're just getting cozy yourself.

Why so broken? Because their internal clocks (circadian rhythms) aren’t fully developed yet. So forget about ""night"" and ""day"" for now—your baby’s schedule is running on instinct.

**Understanding Newborn Sleep Cycles** 🔄

Newborns cycle through light and deep sleep *fast*. A big chunk of that time is spent in **REM sleep**, which supports **brain development**, sensory processing, and memory building. That’s why they twitch, squirm, and smile while dreaming—it’s not a glitch, it’s **growth in action**.

And just when you think you’ve got it figured out? Around **3 months**, they’ll start sleeping longer at night (*cue celebration music*).

**How Sleep Patterns Change Over Time** ⏳

* **Week 1–4:** Your baby basically naps and feeds on repeat.
* **Week 5–8:** Longer nighttime stretches may emerge (hallelujah!).
* **By 3 months:** Some babies sleep 5–6 hours straight—**and parents finally feel human again**.

It’s all part of developing a **sleep-wake cycle**, shaped by feeding, light exposure, and your soothing touch.

**Why Sleep Is Non-Negotiable for Newborns** 🌙

Sleep fuels so much more than rest. While snoozing, your baby’s body is:

* Building **immunity**
* Supporting **physical growth**
* Forming **neural pathways**
* Processing **new sights, sounds, and sensations**

Lack of sleep can lead to crankiness, feeding issues, and slower development. In short, **sleep isn’t a luxury—it’s a biological necessity**.

**Tips for Promoting Healthy Sleep Habits** 🌿

Want to help your baby snooze better? Try these science-backed strategies:

* **Create a bedtime routine**: Bath, feed, cuddle, lullaby.
* **Keep it calm**: Low light, quiet space, no overstimulation.
* **Watch for sleepy cues**: Eye rubbing, fussing, zoning out.
* **Don’t skip naps**: Overtired babies = restless nights.

These tiny tweaks help your baby’s brain learn that *“now it’s time to rest.”*

**Safe Sleep = Sound Sleep** 🚨

According to the **American Academy of Pediatrics**:

* Always place baby on their **back** to sleep
* Use a **firm mattress** with no loose blankets, pillows, or toys
* **Share a room**, not a bed, for at least the first 6 months

These habits lower the risk of SIDS and build a foundation for long-term sleep health.

**So Tell Me—How’s Sleep Going for You?** 💬

What’s been the hardest part? Short naps? Night wakings? That one 5-hour stretch that gave you hope?

I'm looking to start with blue oysters. From what I understand coffee grounds mixed with some straw are a great way fuel the growth of these mushrooms. Coffee grounds need to be used relatively soon after brewing to prevent the growth of contaminants.

I was wondering if anyone had any insight into storing coffee grounds long term to build up a good amount of grounds to get started. I've read that you can store coffee grounds a bit longer if you put them into the fridge. Does anyone have any insight about storing it in the freezer until I have a bulk of grounds built up? If I then took them out of the freezer and broke them up would that work or would I need to repasteurize the grounds?

I'm a 39yr old 5'2"" female who has been drinking coffee for at least 10 years. I used to drink coffee from local shops (which meant the plant milks had oil and sugar in them). I then started to make my own coffee at home with Oatmilk -- specifically, oatly low fat oatmilk which didn't have any additional sugar or oil added to it. I also sweeten my coffee with maple syrup.

I was so tired of buying oatmilk cartons (it's so wasteful) so I decided to try heavily watered down cold brew (which I make at home and heat up on the stove) with maple syrup only and enjoyed it enough to kick the oatmilk habit. I wasn't expecting any changes in this -- but I was SHOCKED how much weight I lost and how flat my stomach was after making this one change. It wasn't like I was drinking tons of oatmilk, probably barely a cup a day -- and yet there was a noticeable difference immediately and weight started to just come off. IT'S ABSOLUTELY INSANE.

I've also noticed my energy is more stable through the morning after changing this one thing.

1jygva4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Autism_Parenting/comments/1jygva4/help_deciding_if_i_should_do_screeningevaluation/,Help deciding if I should do screening/evaluation for 16 month old,"Hello, I have a wonderful 16 month old boy and I have been wondering for a while if some behaviour are typical or not. His dad thinks I am wrong. I did the ASQ-SE for his age and told me he is in the grey area. Did the M-chat and he has a score of 2-3? Does not follow gaze (really rarely), he did started to point at things of interest (but doesn’t look at me, really rarely) and name response is inconsistent. But he also has a lot of behaviours that do not indicate ASD. 

A bit of background to my worries: he is an IVF baby with my only embryo tested ni-PGT as chaotic so my whole pregnancy and after I had a worry in the back of my mind about his development. I am also prone to anxiety. At 4.5 months I noticed he doesn’t really notice me or babble much (even though he did coo at me at 2-3 months), between 4-7 months he didn’t really coo or respond to my sounds. He cooed by himself. At 6 months he started single babbles like “ma”, “ba” etc. At 7 months he started repetitive babbling. Never did conversational babbling. Eye contact was never great - between 4-8/9 months he avoided eye contact up-close or on other occasions, other times he did make eye contact. 

Here are the things that make me wonder: 
- Never did conversational babbling 
- Repetitive gestures (and sounds?) - hand flapping when excited/frustrated, twisting hands with or without holding objects/toys (he doesn’t look at them though), opening-closing hands a few times, stomping feet, sometimes shaked head left-right but seemed to have stopped, pacing the room when bored. I have to mention they do not happen for long and he can be stopped/redirected
- some gross motor delays: he doesn’t get from sitting on his back to sitting on his bum on his own, he doesn’t climb on objects on his own - might not be connected to ASD
- quite fussy, but manageable. He likes to complain a lot. Always has been fussy. 
- Possible sensory issues?: doesn’t like to eat raw vegetables and fruits (doesn’t even want to touch them most of the time), but will eat them if cooked. When he knows a certain object like a vacuum or hair dryer or smoothie maker can get turned on, he protests by fussing or lately just saying “no”. But at the same time, he can get used to them with prolonged exposure (he got used to the coffee grinder maker) Seems to really notice these type of sounds and would comment on them. Some weird things like: putting fingers deep in mouth until he coughs sometimes; putting big pieces of food in his mouth instead of biting down - like a big piece of bread and sometimes chewing it, sometimes spitting it out
- terrible sleeper at night - wakes up multiple times a night (sometimes even 8-10)  and has always been like this. I wonder what the cause might be: is it the sleep association?(nursing to sleep), sleep disorder or apnea?, or a sensitive sleeper? He usually doesn’t stay long awake in the night. His naps are mostly ok. 
- eye contact - it is there, but not the best. He doesn’t check in with me often, but I’ve seen him done it. He’ll point to request and label and to show something interesting (but I’ll say he looks back at me maybe 30% of the time?) 
- doesn’t follow gaze (unless promoted - look at mommy is looking) 
- name response - hit and miss - he has it, but sometimes it’s inconsistent. For example, we were playing with Lego duplo and he was right in front of me. I called his name maybe 10 times before he answered. But weirdly enough, when I said: Look at what momma is doing  (in the exact situation) he immediately looked at me. When I call him from afar, he answers much better. I’ve noticed he doesn’t answer in other situations as well. 

Now the things he does that doesn’t point ASD: 

- He follows point and points consistently 
- Both his receptive and expressive language is very ok. 
- Follows directions 
- Says 100+ words functionally. He says only single words for now. Asks for food, water, outside, uses verbs. He asks, labels and describes and also has what I would call a proto-naration (he recalls past events and uses single words to tell me like : grandma - chickens - water (grandma took him to the chickens and she gave them water) And he also answers to my questions and we “talk” about events together. I say “what did the baby do?” And he’ll say “eat” etc. But he seems quite stubborn in the sense that he doesn’t like to feel like he is interrogated and he doesn’t like repeating what he said twice to another person. He seems selective when he feels like answering. 
- Play skills are great - he uses both pretend play and symbolic play according to his age. He likes to play with me. He loves interactive games like peek-a-boo and chase. He loves to play with other people : he “scares” his grandpa and waits for his response. He doesn’t play for too long with an object or a toy. He switches them often. On the other hand - likes to hold a certain toy (usually a horse figurine) for extended periods of time in one hand and also doesn’t like to roll a ball back and forth or cars back and forth (he hasn’t had much interest in balls on his own either) He can roll the car on his own. Immitates me and other children playing. 
- Fine motor skills are great. Almost drinks out of open cup on his own, started using fork and spoon (but spills a lot), pincer grasp excellent, scribbled since he was 9 months by observing his older nephew doing it. 
- Immitates well both sounds, words and gestures, actions (with some nuance here) 
- Doesn’t seem to have issues with transitions/change? 
- He knows a lot of gestures, including waving and clapping. But waving and clapping - he doesn’t use them as much as if he doesn’t have the motivation too. I’ve seen him use them unpromted rarely and prompted more often. CBut it’s not great. Clapping almost never on his own. He does use some gestures consistently like: reaching to be picked up, pointing, give us high five, nods for no and yes. But when I play a game: “does baby know X gesture?” He answers and does them all. 

There are many more things, but this list is already too long. 

One things I have to mention is that he has a great memory for his age (recalling past events, knowing the orientation of rooms, remembering certain details - like where a whole in the wall is, knows a lot of people’s names - family and friends and many of my school colleagues that he saw in my albums) Weirdly, he sometimes likes to “recall” an event that happened months ago like how a friend of hours immitated a horse sound and his wife did a game with him, or how his grandma took him to her backyard swing and there was a bird on a tree that he showed him. Sometimes he’ll just randomly recall a memory. 

If you read so far and had patience, thank you. He seems like he has his own way to develop?

1jygv6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/find_a_date/comments/1jygv6o/33m4f_texas_online_introverted_gamer_looking_for/,33[M4F] #Texas – Online: Introverted Gamer looking for Permanent Forever 'Player 2',"Looking for My Player 2
Being an introvert has always made it a bit challenging to put myself out there, especially when it comes to finding a partner. I’m not the loudest person in the room, and social situations can sometimes feel overwhelming. But I’ve learned to embrace who I am—someone who values meaningful connections over surface-level interactions. While it hasn’t been easy navigating the dating world, I’m here trying my luck, hoping to find someone who understands the beauty of quiet moments and appreciates shared passions like gaming and deep conversations. If you’re someone who’s also searching for that special connection, maybe we can be each other’s ""Player 2"" in this journey.

By Night: The Watchkeeper
I work as a security officer, primarily on night shifts. My job requires constant vigilance and attention to detail, conducting regular patrols to ensure that the premises are secure and everything is in order. Monitoring surveillance cameras is another key aspect of my role, where I keep a sharp eye out for any unusual activity or potential concerns. It’s a position that demands focus, quick decision-making, and the ability to remain calm under pressure—skills that I’ve come to value both at work and in life. During quieter moments on the shift, I often find ways to stay engaged by watching movies or playing games on my Steam Deck, making use of downtime without losing sight of my responsibilities.

The Gaming Realm Enthusiast
Gaming is my passion, especially when it comes to RPGs, co-op adventures, and PvE-focused games. Titles like Minecraft, Elder Scrolls, Monster Hunter Wilds, and Valheim allow me to immerse myself in vast worlds filled with quests, exploration, and teamwork. I love strategizing with friends in co-op missions or tackling challenges together against the game's environmental elements—like navigating treacherous landscapes or surviving harsh weather conditions. PvE games captivate me because they emphasize collaboration and creativity rather than direct competition. On the flip side, FPS games rarely hold my interest unless they involve cooperative modes or horde-based gameplay—pure PvP shooters just don’t grab my attention. For me, gaming is about building stories, solving challenges as a team, and enjoying immersive experiences that bring people together.

Creative Pursuits
I’ve always had a casual interest in art and music creation. Self-taught in sketching and basic design concepts, I enjoy experimenting with new ideas and techniques whenever inspiration strikes. Music is another creative outlet I’m exploring—I have novice knowledge of piano that I use to craft simple melodies and dream of expanding my skills further. Recently, I’ve been drawn to learning acoustic guitar as a way to complement my piano abilities and deepen my understanding of music composition. There’s something exciting about creating harmonies from scratch and seeing how different instruments can work together to bring ideas to life. While I’m still learning, the process itself is rewarding—it’s less about perfection and more about expressing myself through sound and art.

Melodic Moments
Music is a diverse and integral part of my life. I enjoy listening to a wide range of genres, from the heavy riffs of Stoner, Doom, Desert, and Grudge metal to the eclectic sounds of Indie rock and pop. Electronic music also has a special place in my heart, particularly Progressive House for its emotional depth and layered soundscapes, Synthwave for its nostalgic blend of retro and futuristic elements, and Phonk for its high-energy beats that get me pumped up for my workouts. I’m very lyrical and insightful when it comes to music; I need the lyrics to be meaningful and impactful rather than mindless or repetitive. For me, music is about connection and storytelling—not just background noise.

Dreaming of Simplicity
I believe life doesn’t have to be complicated to be fulfilling. My dream is rooted in embracing simple mediocrity—the kind that allows you to appreciate life’s small joys without chasing after unnecessary chaos or grandeur. Whether it’s sipping coffee on the porch during crisp mornings or tending to a small garden as the sun sets, these moments are where happiness truly resides for me. It’s about finding contentment in everyday routines—cooking dinner while listening to music that resonates deeply or unwinding with a book or game after a long day. I value peace over perfection—a life where things don’t have to be extravagant but are meaningful enough to make you feel grounded. At the end of the day, simplicity isn’t boring; it’s freeing.

The Final Piece
If you’ve made it this far—thank you! This post has been through countless edits because I wanted it to reflect who I truly am while being inviting enough for someone like you to connect with me. What I’m looking for is someone who shares many of these interests—gaming adventures, creative pursuits, diverse music tastes—and values open communication above all else. A partner who isn’t afraid to share their opinions or even disagree with mine without taking offense because meaningful discussions (and even disputes) are what help us grow together.

I’m not looking for something short-term; I want something lasting—a long-term connection or even a forever term if we’re lucky enough to find that spark together. If you’re someone who values honesty, mutual respect, shared passions, and building something meaningful over time, then let’s start this journey together.
