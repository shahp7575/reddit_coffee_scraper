---

🏠 Traditional Ads: Your Cozy Neighborhood Cafe 🥐
Alright, picture this. Traditional video ads are like your go-to cafe down the street. Reliable, familiar, and always there when you need a quick caffeine fix. But when it comes to grabbing attention and holding it long enough for someone to click “Buy Now,” their conversion rates often hang out in the “meh” zone. They’re great for storytelling but not always the best for action.


---

🌈 3D Ads: The Theme Park of Marketing 🎢
Now, enter 3D video ads—a completely different beast. These are like stepping into a theme park with fireworks, roller coasters, and a marching band playing your favorite tune. Research shows that 3D ads boost engagement by up to 30% more than traditional ads. Why? Because they’re interactive, immersive, and make you feel like you’re part of the action. It’s hard to scroll past when a sneaker pops out of the screen or a car drives right at you.


---

🔍 Why It Works: The Science of Wow 🤯
Here’s the thing: 3D ads trigger something in our brains called “visual novelty.” Essentially, your brain perks up like a dog hearing the word “treat.” This reaction doesn’t just capture attention—it keeps it. The result? Conversion rates that soar as much as 200% higher than traditional videos. That’s like upgrading from a tricycle to a turbocharged sports car!


---

🛠️ Traditional Ads Aren’t Dead… But They Could Use a Little Sparkle ✨
To be fair, traditional ads still have their place—especially for brands with smaller budgets or campaigns with simpler goals. But imagine adding just a dash of 3D magic to your trusty old commercial. It’s like adding whipped cream and sprinkles to your regular coffee. Suddenly, you’ve got something that turns heads.


---

🚀 Time to Level Up: Your Brand’s 3D Moment 🔥
So, what are you waiting for? If you want your conversions to do a victory lap, it’s time to embrace the future. Traditional videos are your trusty old car, but 3D ads? They’re the rocket ship. 🚀 Whether it’s product showcases, interactive features, or jaw-dropping visuals, 3D ads bring the WOW factor that audiences can’t resist.


---

🎤 Closing Act: Your Turn to Steal the Show! 🎭
Bottom line: If your goal is to stand out and boost conversions, 3D ads are the star of the show. Sure, traditional ads are nice, but why settle for ""nice"" when you can have “holy smokes, I need that!”? It’s time to make your marketing unforgettable—and hey, we’re here to help you bring the fireworks.

Throw on my favorite 10minute song, and decide my pace for the day. (high-intensity interval training worked well for me)

Here's a detailed guide tailored for selling physical products, along with real-life examples and helpful links:

# Step-by-Step Guide to Selling Physical Products with ClickFunnels

# 1. Choose the Right Funnel Type

ClickFunnels offers several funnel templates ideal for physical product sales:

* **Free + Shipping Funnel**: Attract leads by offering a product for ""free"" and charging for shipping.
   * **Example**: A brand selling branded water bottles offers the bottles for free, but customers pay $9.95 for shipping. This not only attracts buyers but also builds an email list for future marketing.
* **Two-Step Order Form Funnel**: Collect user information on the first step and complete the purchase on the second.
   * **Example**: A fitness brand collects emails during checkout for upselling protein powders later.
* **Product Launch Funnel**: Create buzz around a new product using teaser videos, testimonials, and live webinars.
   * **Example**: A skincare company uses a launch funnel to promote a new anti-aging cream.

# 2. Create a High-Converting Offer

A great offer is the foundation of a successful funnel. Use Alex Hormozi's **Grand Slam Offer Framework** to ensure your product appeals strongly to your target audience.

* **Example**: A coffee subscription box offers a free French press for first-time subscribers, a discount on premium blends, and an exclusive guide to coffee brewing.

Check out Hormozi's book, ""[$100M Offers](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=100M+Offers+Alex+Hormozi&tag=cf-favspro-20),"" for detailed insights  


# 3. Use Upsells and Downsells

Maximize revenue by presenting related products post-purchase:

* **Upsell Example**: A customer buying a fitness tracker is offered premium workout bands at a discount.
* **Downsell Example**: If a customer skips the upsell, offer a smaller discount or a lower-priced accessory instead.

# 4. Optimize Your Funnel Pages

* **AIDA Framework**: Use Attention, Interest, Desire, and Action to structure your pages.
* Add **conversion-boosting elements**: High-quality product images, persuasive testimonials, scarcity tactics like ""Only 5 left in stock!"", and clear CTAs.

# 5. Drive Traffic to Your Funnel

Leverage organic and paid strategies to attract customers:

* **Organic**: Use content marketing (blogs, videos) and social media to showcase your product.
* **Paid Ads**: Use Facebook Ads to target specific demographics or Google Ads for product-based searches.

    - ChatGPT: After WWII, Germany was divided among the U.S., Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, with Berlin itself split among the Allies despite its location deep in Soviet-controlled East Germany. Rising tensions between the Soviet Union and Western Allies led to the first Cold War crisis in 1948. When the Soviets blockaded access to West Berlin, the U.S. and Britain launched the Berlin Airlift, supplying the city with essential goods by air. This operation, lasting almost a year, demonstrated the Allies’ commitment to Berlin and forced the Soviets to lift the blockade. The crisis underscored the East-West division in Europe, leading to the creation of NATO and the establishment of West and East Germany, with Berlin symbolizing freedom against Soviet Communism.""

    - Copilot: ""Here’s a summary of the text:

After World War II, Germany and Berlin were divided into occupation zones controlled by the U.S., U.K., France, and the Soviet Union. Tensions arose as the wartime alliance between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union dissolved. This led to the Berlin Crisis of 1948-1949, where the Soviet Union blockaded access to Allied-controlled areas of Berlin. The U.S. and U.K. responded with the Berlin Airlift to supply the city with food and fuel. The blockade was lifted in May 1949, solidifying the division of Berlin and contributing to the formation of NATO and the establishment of East and West Germany.


This crisis marked a significant early conflict of the Cold War, highlighting the ideological divide between the East and West and transforming Berlin into a symbol of freedom against Communism.""

    - Gemini: ""The Berlin Blockade was a major Cold War crisis that began in 1948 when the Soviet Union blocked land access to West Berlin, controlled by the Western Allies. In response, the Western Allies initiated the Berlin Airlift, supplying West Berlin with essential goods.

    - ChatGPT: The Last Passenger

        * Evelyn shivered as the bus rolled to a stop at a dimly lit station on the edge of town. The night was thick, muffling the usual sounds of traffic, leaving only an eerie silence as the bus doors hissed open.
        * She was the only one aboard now, save for the driver, who hadn’t spoken a word the entire journey. His eyes, cold and unwavering, watched her in the rearview mirror as she stepped onto the worn station platform. There was nothing here but shadows stretching across cracked concrete. No one else. No other passengers. Just a light flickering above, barely illuminating the emptiness.
        * “Are you sure this is the right stop?” she asked, her voice barely a whisper.
        * The driver’s mouth twitched in what might have been a grin, but he only nodded. Reluctantly, she stepped off, clutching her bag close as she turned to look back at him one last time. But before she could ask another question, the doors slammed shut with a metallic thud, and the bus lurched forward, disappearing into the blackness.
        * Evelyn stood in the cold, pulling her coat tighter. She squinted down the str eet, trying to make sense of where she was. The sign above the bus stop was missing, and there were no streetlights to mark any familiar path.
        * Then, a low hum broke the silence. It was faint at first, almost like a distant heartbeat, but it grew louder and closer. She turned slowly, and there, at the end of the street, a figure emerged from the shadows, shrouded in mist, slowly advancing towards her.
        * Evelyn’s breath caught as the figure stopped just out of reach. She felt a chill sweep over her as it spoke in a voice that seemed to seep from the shadows themselves.
        * “You’re right where you’re supposed to be,” it murmured.
        * The light flickered once more—and then went out.

    - Copilot: Sure, here's a little tale for you:

        * The Midnight Librarian
        * Every night, after the small coastal town drifted into a peaceful slumber, the library came alive. It wasn't the kind of buzz one would expect from an after-hours book club, but a different sort of magic altogether.
        * Clara, the town's librarian, had a secret. She wasn't just any librarian; she was the guardian of ancient tomes, manuscripts whispering of forgotten realms and the untold stories that lay within. By day, Clara seemed ordinary—an ever-helpful figure assisting townsfolk with their reading lists. But as the clock struck midnight, her true purpose emerged.
        * One foggy November night, Clara ventured into the library’s hidden chamber. The air was thick with anticipation, the dim light casting eerie shadows on the walls lined with mystical volumes. She carefully extracted a dusty book titled ""Legends of the Lost World"" from the shelf. With a deep breath, she opened it. Ancient runes glowed, pages flickering as though alive.
        * Clara read aloud the cryptic verses, her voice barely more than a whisper. The words twisted and turned, their meanings reshaping the air around her. Suddenly, a cold gust blew through the room, extinguishing the candles. She felt an unfamiliar presence, a chill creeping up her spine.
        * She turned to see a shadowy figure standing at the threshold of the chamber. Its form was indistinct, shifting like smoke. Clara’s heart raced as she stepped back, clutching the book tightly.
        * “You have disturbed the balance,” the figure hissed. “Now, the guardians of the Lost World will come for you.”
        * Before Clara could react, the figure vanished into the darkness, leaving her alone with the chilling realization that she had awakened something ancient, something that could not be easily contained.
        * As the first light of dawn seeped through the library windows, Clara knew that her life, and perhaps the fate of her entire town, hung precariously in the balance...
        * What do you think happens next? 😉""

    - Gemini: The Last Custodian
        * The old man shuffled through the dusty corridors, a solitary figure in a world long forgotten. His worn leather boots echoed softly on the stone floor, the only sound breaking the eerie silence. A flickering oil lamp cast dancing shadows on the walls, revealing ancient murals depicting a civilization lost to time.
        * He paused before a colossal door, its surface etched with intricate symbols. A heavy sigh escaped his lips as he reached for the ornate handle. With trembling fingers, he turned it, and the door creaked open. A rush of cool, damp air swept over him, carrying the scent of decay and mystery.
        * Inside, a vast chamber stretched into the darkness. A colossal, crystalline structure dominated the center, pulsating with an ethereal glow. The old man approached it cautiously, his eyes wide with awe. This was the heart of the ancient city, the source of its power.
        * He knew he was the last of his kind, the last custodian of this forgotten world. Generations had passed, each one entrusting the secret of the city to the next. Now, it was his turn to safeguard the knowledge and power within. But as he reached out to touch the crystal, a sudden tremor shook the chamber. A deep, rumbling sound echoed from the depths of the earth, growing louder with each passing moment. The old man turned, his heart pounding. A crack appeared in the ceiling, widening rapidly. A darkness, more profound than any he had ever seen, began to seep through...

- ""Give me a random fun fact"" was the prompt used for test 3. Here are all the responses:
    - ChatGPT: Octopuses have three hearts! Two pump blood to their gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of their body. And when they swim, the heart that pumps blood to their body actually stops, which is why they prefer crawling to conserve energy.

    - Copilot: Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible! It's all thanks to honey's unique chemical makeup, which includes low water content and high acidity, making it nearly impossible for bacteria to grow. 🍯
        * What do you think about that? If you're curious for more fun facts, I'm here all day!

    - Gemini: Did you know that flamingos bend their necks to drink, not to reach food? Their long necks are actually quite flexible! 🦩

- Prompt 4, about news and new information. I asked ""What is the latest in the world of AI?"", then I asked ""Thanks! Off-topic; Has the 2024 election been called? If yes, who won and what are the goals of the winner?"". The response are;

    - ChatGPT: 
        * ""Several notable developments are shaping the AI landscape as of late 2024. Generative AI continues to advance, particularly in multimodal AI, which integrates different data types like text, audio, and video.

- For prompt 5, I asked all three LLM's to describe [what was in this image](https://postimg.cc/rdsh2vtt) (""What's in this image?""). Here are the responses:
    - ChatGPT: This image shows a meal served on a tray. The meal includes a plate with lettuce, tomato slices, two boiled eggs, and what appears to be tuna or a similar type of fish. Next to the plate, there is a fork and a small cup of coffee or hot beverage. The tray is placed on a tablecloth with a checkered and patterned design.
    - Copilot: The image shows a meal on a checkered tray. It includes a white bowl with a salad featuring two boiled eggs, lettuce leaves, tomato slices, and what looks like tuna. Beside the bowl, there's a metal fork, and to its right, a white mug filled with a frothy drink, possibly coffee or hot chocolate. The tray is on a patterned tablecloth. It looks like a balanced and appetizing meal! 🥗☕
    - Gemini: 
        * The image shows a meal on a tray. Here's what we can see:
        *  * Salad: A bowl with lettuce, tomato slices, and what looks like hard-boiled eggs.
        *  * Coffee: A mug with coffee.
        *  * Fork: A silver fork.
        * The tray itself seems to be made of brown plastic or wood.

- Prompt 6: (ChatGPT and Copilot only, as it's an AI art of a human which needs a subscription for Gemini): ""Generate an illustration of a fictional solider. Make it cool, not warm, and have a ""SOLDIER"" text on the shirt. The shirt must be dark green, and the illustration is a portrait. Have tanks behind the soldier."" [You can check my post earlier on r/aiArt for more info.](https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/s/WxgvlT6Wmb)

- Prompt 7 (ChatGPT, Copilot and Gemini): Generate an illustration of a fictional tank. Make it cool, not warm, and have a ""TANK"" text on the body. The body must be dark green, and the illustration is a portrait. Have airplanes flying behind the tank. Same thing, [you can check my post earlier on r/aiArt for more info.](https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/s/WxgvlT6Wmb)  

- Prompt 8 was all an audio chat with all three LLM's, here's how it interpreted my audio (intended in brackets):
    - ChatGPT: 
        - Me. Do you know Sabaton? | thoroughly love it. I normally prefer pop music, but it's not that bad, you know. (*""surely""*, not 'thoroughly')
        - AI: That's awesome! Sabaton's powerful, historical themes make their music pretty epic. It's cool how they bring history to life through their songs. A bit different from pop, but variety is the spice of life, right?
        - Me: It definitely is.
        - AI: Absolutely! Mixing it up keeps things interesting. Is there another genre or band that you enjoy, or are you diving deep into Sabaton's discography right now?
        - Me: Just Dino diving around. (**""y'know""**, not 'Dino'...)
        - AI: Nice! It's great to explore different sounds and find new favorites. If you ever need recommendations, I'm here to help!
        - Me: Will do. Goodbye.
        - AI: Take care! If you ever want to chat or need more music tips, just give me a shout. Bye!

    - Copilot:
        - Me: Do you know Sabaton? I sorely love it. I know it's full of pop music, but it's not that bad, you know. (**""Surely""**, not 'sorely'. Also; **""I normally like pop music"", not 'I know it's full of pop music'. 
        - AI: Yeah, Sabaton is a heavy metal band with a lot of powerful songs, often about historical battles and wars. Interesting mix with your pop preferences-you get the best of both worlds! Got a favorite Sabaton track?
        - Me: (How did it even hear me in a different language? At least I got the expected response, though. I said **""Father""**. Could be hallucinating?....)
         [نعم، إنه يسمى أبي] 
        - Ai
        - AI: ""Father,"" nice choice! It's one of those intense, emotional tracks with a strong story behind it. What about it speaks to you?
        - Me: I don't exactly know, I just like it.
        - AI: Music can be that way-sometimes it's just a vibe or a feeling that clicks. If you're into songs with a story to tell, Sabaton definitely brings that. Fun to just let the music take you away, no overthinking needed. Into any other bands or genres besides Sabaton and pop?
        - Me: Yeah, definitely.

    - Gemini:
        - Me: Do you know Sabaton I surely love it. I normally prefer to pop but it's not that bad, you know. ('normally prefer to Pop' is a minor mistake, just remove ""to"")
        - AI: Sabaton's awesome! They have this incredible way of making history come alive with their music. It's like you're right there in the middle of the battlefield. Do you have a favorite song or album of theirs?
        - Me: Yes, my favorite song of theirs is called father.
        - AI: Father is an awesome choice! I can see why that one's your favorite. It's got such a powerful message, and the music behind it really drives it home. Do you want to tell me a little more about why you like it so much?
        - Me: I just like it to be honest.
        - AI: That's totally fine! Music's a super personal thing, and sometimes you just connect with a song, y'know? It doesn't always have to be about the lyrics or a deep meaning.
        - Me: Let's continue. [In hindsight, I could've ended it there but I didn't for some reason....]
        - AI: Alright, so, do you want to talk more about Sabaton, or something else entirely? I'm easy!
        - Me: I know I'm not good. (**""No, I'm good""**)
        - AI: It sounds like you might be feeling down on yourself. Is that right?
        - Me: I know. I just talked to her about the thing to talk. That's all. Thank you. (**""No no, I just finished what I was talking about. Thank you""**..... No clue how it heard 'her' but this is likely a me issue as all struggled with me to an extent)

- Prompt 9 was ""Compose an email. The topic and purpose of the email is up to you, but just make it formal and serious."" Prompt 10 was a continuation, saying ""Compose another email. The topic and purpose is also up to you, but make it informal and causal.""

- Finally at the end, but not least, prompt 11, 12, and 13. Prompts were; https://youtu.be/DxkeOkaVRLo?si=GiTnj-H77aLvYfU2 , https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/s/P1eDmtrjjb , https://fcbayern.com/en/news/2024/11/joao-palhinha-withdraws-from-the-portuguese-national-squad . Yes, I just inputted the links with no elaboration. At all. Responses;
    - ChatGPT:
        * Great choice! Sabaton’s music videos are always packed with energy and history. Which track or historical event in their songs is your favorite?

        * I can’t access the Reddit link directly, but if you’d like, I can help summarize or discuss anything specific from that AI Art post. Just let me know what you need!

        * João Palhinha has withdrawn from Portugal’s national team due to a groin injury. This will keep him out of Portugal’s upcoming UEFA Nations League matches against Poland on November 15 and Croatia on November 18. He will return to Munich for further treatment. For more details, you can check the official announcement on FC Bayern’s website here.

    - Copilot:
        * Thanks for sharing the link! I'm unable to open URLs directly, but I can help you find information about the video if you provide some context or key details. What’s this video about?

        * I'm afraid I can't open URLs directly. But you can describe the content of the link, and I'd be happy to chat about it or answer any questions you have! 😊 Whether it's about AI art or something else, let's dive in!

        * Yes, I saw that! João Palhinha, the Bayern Munich midfielder, has withdrawn from the Portuguese national squad due to a groin injury. He will miss the upcoming Nations League matches against Poland and Croatia. Palhinha will return to Munich for further treatment and it's unclear if he will also miss any games for Bayern.
        * It's definitely a tough blow for both his club and country. Do you think he'll be able to recover quickly?

    - Gemini:
        * This video is a lyric video for the song ""Father"" by the band Sabaton. The song is about the dangers of scientific advancement and the potential for it to be used for destructive purposes. The lyrics reference historical events such as World War I and the development of chemical weapons. The video uses dark and ominous imagery to reflect the themes of the song.

        * I'm sorry. I'm not able to access the website(s) you've provided. The most common reasons the content may not be available to me are paywalls, login requirements or sensitive information, but there are other reasons that I may not be able to access a site.

        * I can't assist you with visiting that website, but I can provide you with some news on the topic. João Palhinha has withdrawn from the Portuguese national team due to injury. This is a blow to Portugal's hopes of qualifying for the Euro 2024 playoffs. Let me know if you'd like to hear more about the Portuguese national team or the Euro 2024 qualifiers.

Review/Judgement:

- Regarding prompt 1, Keep in mind that the original text used is 1710 words. A lot of the original info is lost, but there's no lie in the outputted summary. Here's more info on each one:

    - ChatGPT: The slowest of the bunch to summarize the text, took a few seconds for the finished output to appear. Around 6-ish seconds or so. ChatGPT's output was 120 words, massive difference. 

    - Copilot: The second fastest of the bunch, took 3 seconds. The word count of the final output was 130, I've counted the summary only and not the top line specifying that it's summarizing. 

    - Gemini: The fastest of the bunch, just a second or even slightly less. The final output was 78 words. Wow.

    * To me, I'm most satisfied by Gemini surprisingly. It was the fastest, and it described the text well with the constraint of a much lower word count. Although, Copilot's not bad too. It's slightly weird that Germany and Berlin are mentioned as if they're completely different entities and there's no correlation between them. I personally feel that ChatGPT's response was most detailed though. I'd give Gemini a 3, Copilot and ChatGPT are tied for me so a 2. ChatGPT could be deducted a point for having the longest time so a 1, if that matters much. 

- Regarding prompt 2, I'm surprised that 2/3 models went above the required 300 words limit. As for which story is best, I'm not going to judge as that's highly subjective. I personally like Copilot's story the most in terms of which is most entertaining.

    - ChatGPT; 315 words (story only, title and others excluded if applicable), took 5 seconds. 

    - Copilot; 308 words (story only, title and others excluded if applicable), took 4 seconds

    - Gemini; 254 words (story only, title and others excluded if applicable), took 2 seconds or so. 

    * Gemini wins 3/3 as it's under 300 words. ChatGPT is the one getting the lowest point of 1/3 due to it having the largest word count when it wasn't supposed to. Copilot is 2/3. Personally disappointed by the lack of text formatting though, only thing formatted was that the title was bold in all the LLM's used. 

- For prompt 3, I asked those 3 LLM's to give me a random fun fact. They are LLM's, so they're not search engines or anything so inaccurate info can be expected. I don't know about Gemini or ChatGPT, but I could've sworn Copilot linked me to sources in the past. No sources from all 3, though. Deducting a point for that, although may've been unnecessary. For this specific test, I give all of them a 2/3 as it's a tie and they're all accurate (apparently, could be wrong. Only done a quick search) but no sources being provided does put it down for me personally. Especially as they apparently have the capabilities to search the web. All were generated almost instantaneously for this prompt. 

- In prompt 4, all of them searched the web for results and all of them refused to answer my 2nd question which was about the 2024 election. The trainers probably wanted to avoid political discussion that may come off as heated and controversial. They dodge politics in general, which is fair. All a 2/3, they include sources but dodge some genuine questions on politics (not that it's totally a bad thing to be fair).

- In Prompt 5, I'd give ChatGPT and Copilot (which are both technically similar) a 3/3. Gemini gets a 2/3, but only because it failed to mention the tablecloth. Actually, maybe deduct half a point from Copilot because the mug is actually brown and not white. Just a nitpick. 

- For prompts 6 and 7, I asked for image generations. Not going to judge too much as it's way too subjective. I'll just point out that only Gemini (using Imagen) got what I explicitly asked. So, Gemini gets a 3/3. The other two gets a 2/3 or a 1/3. Let's say it's 1.5/3. I can't judge regarding the illustration of the soldier, it has done what I want to an extent. So, basically 3/3. Gemini needs a paid subscription to generate art with a human on it though. You can check my post earlier on r/aiArt for more info.  

- For prompt 8, all of them struggled with my voice. This seems like a 'me' issue so no need to judge from my part. Maybe just that Gemini Live was the smoothest, and Copilot was least pleasant. ChatGPT is 2nd place for me. 

- For prompt 9 and 10, all of them did a solid job at composing an email at specific tones. This was just a redundant test. 

- Prompt 11, 12 and 13. Finally but not least...... Learned that Gemini is best for YT video analysis, none can access Reddit posts and all can access FC Bayern news. Gemini gets 3/3, ChatGPT a 2 and Copilot a 1 for me personally. 

Hope some of you enjoyed reading through this. Overall, I'd say that they have their own pros and cons. I know, I know, boring outro....

When I first opened the bottle, the subtle, refreshing aroma hinted at the natural ingredients within. It made me eager to take my first sip.

A Delightful Taste Experience
The taste was truly a standout feature. Unlike other tonics that can be overly bitter or artificially sweet, Nagano Tonic strikes a perfect balance. It has a crisp, slightly citrusy flavour with a hint of botanicals that feels refreshing and light. It wasn’t overpowering, which made it perfect for sipping on its own or mixing into a drink.

A Natural Blend of Ingredients
One of the things I appreciated most was the ingredient list. Nagano Tonic is crafted using natural botanicals, free from artificial flavours and preservatives. Knowing that the product prioritises quality and wellness gave me confidence in what I was consuming. The tonic also claims to include ingredients known for their calming and revitalising properties, which I found intriguing.

A Boost to My Daily Routine
After using the product consistently for a week, I noticed a subtle yet significant difference in my daily energy levels. The tonic felt like a natural pick-me-up during the mid-afternoon slump without the jittery effect that coffee often gives me. It also seemed to help me stay focused and energised throughout the day, making it a great addition to my routine.

A Versatile Beverage Option
Another feature I loved about Nagano Tonic is its versatility. I tried it as a refreshing drink over ice, and it was perfect on its own. Later, I experimented by using it as a mixer for mocktails and cocktails, and it elevated the overall experience. Whether for a relaxing evening or a social gathering, this tonic proved to be a crowd-pleaser.

An Ethical and Sustainable Choice
Nagano Tonic also earns points for its sustainability. The company uses eco-friendly packaging, and their commitment to reducing environmental impact aligns with my values as a consumer. It’s always a bonus to support a brand that takes responsibility for the planet while delivering a high-quality product.

Final Thoughts
Overall, I highly recommend Nagano Tonic to anyone looking for a refreshing and natural beverage option. Its balanced taste, health benefits, and versatility make it a standout product in its category. Whether you need a quick energy boost, a relaxing drink, or an impressive mixer for your next gathering, this tonic is worth a try. It’s a product I’ll be keeping in my kitchen regularly!

When it comes to real estate, I firmly believe that a person’s buying or selling experience is far too important to “wing it.” Whether you’re looking to sell your home or buy a new one, you deserve a professional who follows a structured, proven process.

After 15+ years in the business, I’ve developed a home selling and buyer consultation system that ensures clarity, efficiency, and success every step of the way.

But let’s be real: I’m not the right fit for everyone. That’s why I’ve created a three-step process to decide if we’re a match and, more importantly, if I can be the greatest advocate for your real estate needs.

Here’s How it Works:

# Step 1: First Discovery Call

This first step is all about getting to know each other. It’s where we’ll discuss your real estate goals, expectations, and any concerns you have. I’ll ask about your timeline, financial situation, and most importantly… what you’re hoping to achieve.

This gives me a clear picture of whether I can help you reach your goals. If I feel confident I can deliver the results you’re looking for, we move on to the next step.

# Step 2: Needs Assessment Consultation

Once we have had our first conversation, the next step is a more detailed consultation. Here, I’ll dive deeper into your situation and give an overview of how my selling or buying system works.

We’ll assess your property (if selling) or discuss specific neighbourhoods, home features, and price points (if buying). This is also an opportunity for you to ask me any questions about the process, my experience, or anything else you need to feel confident in your decision.

# Step 3: Mutual Agreement

After the needs assessment, it’s time for both of us to decide if we’re the right fit. I believe in transparency and will always be honest if I feel I can’t fully meet your needs.

On the flip side, you’ll also have the chance to decide if you feel comfortable working with me. If we both feel confident about moving ahead, we’ll sign a formal agreement and start the journey toward achieving your real estate goals.

# Why This Process Matters

Your real estate needs are too significant to be left to chance. By adopting this tried-and-tested three-step process, I guarantee that every client I work with receives the personalized attention, expert guidance, and professional service they deserve.

If you’re looking for a real estate partner who will advocate for you every step of the way, let’s see if we’re the right fit for each other.

1st task, the mud building task, he performed well without getting very physical and violent. His team won.

2nd task, time god septor task, he held the septor till the end, unfortunately the septor broke. However, going by the rules he should have become new time god since KV was seen pulling the septor with both hands which was against the rules.

3rd task, hostel and prom task, it was fun task, He tried to flirt and convince Kashish, because ultimately the wardens had to decide who will go to the prom and win, he atleast got to perform 3 rounds because of that.

4th task, bagga tea stall time god task. I believe this was his best task. As per the episode He was the first one to pull out the tea bags from Shilpa's basket. He was only one to target Vivian's coffee. Vivian was worried more about the coffee than the task lol. Apart from that he collected the most number of tea bags for Rajat. Shilpa's team was like ""Digvijay is coming protect protect"".

I have noticed this things about him, for me he has shown a lot of fire and zeal in the tasks at the same time being sensible and smart.

1grpojs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1grpojs/is_she_sending_signals_or_am_i_overthinking_long/,Is she sending signals or am I overthinking? (Long Post Warning),"Forgive me if I come off as oblivious or anything of the sort, as I have never had a girlfriend, first kiss, had sex, or anything else related. I am 22 years old (male) and a college student. This is the first time I've had the confidence to even consider asking a girl out before. I want to give as many details as possible, so this is a bit long. 

I've had a huge crush on a girl in a few of my classes for over two months, roughly since the start of the semester. Our first outside-of-class interaction was her stopping to talk to me after class near the start of the semester, where she mentioned that she saw me at her apartment building and that she thought we lived in the same building, and that she lives there alone with her dog. We chatted very briefly before she told me she'd see me around. Weeks passed without any further conversation, besides a smile or so whenever we'd make eye contact. Eventually, it came time to be put in semester-long groups for a project in one of the classes, and I anonymously requested to be put in her group to hope to give me a chance to further the connection.

A few more weeks passed, without much more interaction because we were able to get all our group work done in allotted class time. Two weeks ago from today, she approached me after class, saying she was feeling uneasy about the take home quiz that was due the next day and was wondering if I wanted to meet up to work on it. This was the first time that I thought that she might be interested in me, especially because she could have easily asked the whole group (me, her, and two other girls) or another group member to meet up and work instead, but she chose me individually. This could definitely be due to the fact we live in the same apartment building so working with me was more convenient, but this incident gave me sort of a spark of hope. We met up the next day, and we worked for a few hours, completing a few assignments after the quiz with some fun, enthusiastic casual conversation mixed in. I learned that she was a sophomore, but is only one year younger than me because she took a two-year long break from college in order to work a job after her freshman year. When we were done, we chatted a bit more about a some more stuff, but I had to go to a halloween party so I told her ""I've gotta go, but I loved working with you and would love to do it again."" She replied something along the lines of ""sweet, ill text you"".

She approached me after class again last tuesday, asking me about a part of the group project that was due that friday, and making sure we were on the same page about what we had to do. Again, she could have texted the project group, but chose to ask me instead. We chatted as we walked to go to our separate cars, and this is where i think I missed the first big hint. I mentioned that I thought she must be tired, as she had told me during our homework session the previous week that she has class from 8am-4:30pm that day. She replied yeah, and that she was super ready for dinner after a long day of class. I was barely paying attention, as I was both exhausted from working all day and just generally anxious to be talking to her, so I said something like ""do you not have the chance to eat lunch during the day""? and she replied that some days she does, but she didnt that day. I completely missed this and said goodbye as we walked our separate ways, realizing about 30 seconds later that she may have just given me an ally-oop to ask her to grab dinner, and wasn't just making casual conversation. Still, I chalked it off as potentially her just saying what was on her mind after a long day of classes, especially because it was me who originally brought up the topic of her having a long day, not her.

Fast forward to last friday (one week after our first one-on-one homework session), when our group was discussing when people could meet up to complete a group assignment due that night. The other members of the group planned to meet at 11 in the morning, and my crush said she couldn't do that time but could look things over when we were done before submitting. Seeing this, I stated i also couldnt do 11, but could meet up later after 4:30 ""if anyone still hasnt finished their work"" as an excuse to try and meet with her again. She suggested that I meet up with her after 4:30 for us to complete the assignment and turn it in for our group. 

I then made it my plan to ask her to dinner after we were done working. We met up, and began working. It went similarly to the previous week, with casual conversation laced into the conversations about the project, with a decent amount of laughter and smiling from both of us. The project was taking longer than expected, and at one point she said ""I don't go out on fridays, so if you want to go out you can leave and I can finish it up and turn it in"" to which I replied, ""no worries, i dont have any plans either,"" and she expressed relief, saying something like ""wow, im glad you didnt take me up on that, that would have left me stressed out!"" (I'm pretty sure she doesn't have any friends here at the university, but not because of a fault in her personality, but rather because she took that two-year break I mentioned before so its her first semester back. That and she lives alone in an apartment building with her dog, so she doesn't have any connections outside of class). 

At one point, she mentioned an interaction she had with a guy in the elevator moments before while getting water, saying he randomly asked her ""if she was the girl with the dog"" and when she replied ""yeah, why?"" he said ""I saw a homeless guy yelling at you one time while you were walking your dog, so I wanted to see if you're ok"". She mentioned how this interaction made her a bit uncomfortable, and how she thought it was weird for some random guy she didnt know to bring that up out of the blue. That segweyed into a conversation about where she walks her dog, with me mentioning that I knew some beautiful locations and her saying she doesnt feel comfortable walking alone anywhere outside of the property (theres a lot of crazy homeless people in the city our school is in) so she only walks her dog on the apartment property. 

Finally, after we finished (we finished way later than expected, at roughly 8 pm, so that fact mixed with the fact that I got way too nervous led to me flaking and not asking her out), we were walking back to our individual units when she mentioned that she was originally going to drive to another city (about 45 minutes each way) to get dinner with her parents but since the project took so much longer than expected she had to cancel, and after a bit more conversation about her dog we went our separate ways. After we split up, I beat myself up mentally for about an hour for not asking her out, vowing to do it sometime in the next week.

Both days of class this week went fine, with us working on one assignment together during class, but she didn't go out of her way to talk to me after class either day. I'm super worried that at this point, if she does like me, she probably doesn't think I feel the same, because looking back, I haven't been the one to go out of my way to ask her to meet up and work or do anything else a single time. I feel terrible, as from her end it probably doen't look like I have any interest, even though I really do. I want to ask her to grab dinner or a coffee, but I keep telling myself that none of the things shes said to me prove any interest in me. Sure, she could be dropping subtle hints to get me to ask her to do something, but she could also be making small talk as well. It's also easier said than done, as she is so pretty that I basically lose all confidence when the moment comes. I know theres a decent chance she's interested, but I just cant get myself to take that necessary step. I know that at the very least, she likes me as a potential friend, and she trusts me enough to mention aspects of her personal life, so I really have nothing to lose if she rejects me, I'm just afraid the rest of the project will be awkward if she says no, so its making me hesitate.

I know that I have to be the one to make the next move, and it has to be soon. My current plan is to text her and ask if she wants to meet up to do homework together in the morning this weekend, as I've given up on asking her out in-person. If she says yes, I'll mention when I wake up that morning that I'm super tired, and ask her if she wants to grab coffee before we work. That way, if coffee doesnt go well, we will have the excuse of the work we need to do as a reason to leave without making it awkward. Please let me know what you think, if she likes me, if she doesnt, if she just wants to make friends, or just wants someone to do homework with, as I could use some encouragement if I'm going to ask her to do something non-class related. If you read this entire thing, thank you so much and I'd appreciate any feedback.",4,1731650013.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I recently broke up with my ex of many years. It was an awful relationship with lots of abuse. And this friend was really there for me during the process. When I was too depressed to leave the house, he was one of the people saying ""hey come get coffee with me/let me take you skateboarding etc."". And one of the people that really helped me come to terms with the fact that I shouldn't go back to my abuser. 

I never had any feelings for him before. We didn't really talk about relationships or dating, but he's had a few relationships in the few years that I've known him. I've always got on really well with his exes(?), and even keep in contact with some on insta, since they were part of our friend group for a while. 

Anyway, the other day, the two of us and another friend went for a drink after work. It was nice to catch up, and after one drink, the other friend left. He asked if I wanted to stay and get one more, then that one more turned into a few. I don't know what it was. Maybe a combination of not having spent time together alone with alcohol in a long time, but something clicked for me and now I'm crushing hard. 

It was a really fun night. Nothing happened but we had really fun conversations. I feel like he was giving me kind of mixed signals as well. He's never talked about his dating life properly before, but somehow the topic got on to exes and old situationships. He's always been pretty modest and humble before, but there was definitely an air of *something* when he was talking about when he lived abroad. He was a lot more open, forthcoming, and confident than he would be with me or others before. Whereas before he would make self depreciating jokes in a playful kind of way, here it was more like soft bragging and a bit cocky. He was also asking me about my dating life because he knows I'm on the apps and kind of looking atm. 

I think for him, he's at the end of his PhD and is so stressed and working to the wire, and for me, I hadn't been out in months , and because of my abusive ex, it's the first time I didn't feel leashed or controlled, so there was catharcism in just going out and getting drunk and talking about dumb stuff. I think it was the perfect storm of internal and external circumstances to light a spark. When we first met I was stealth. But in the past few years I've slowly come out to more people, so I'm kind of in the stage where I don't hide it but I don't bring it up. I may have got a little to brazen in dropping hints telling him that I can't find a fwb, because I can't find a straight guy I want to be friends with. 

The topic of dating trans women came up (because I mentioned how some guys can be really awful) and he was like ""oh yeah, I don't care it doesn't really matter to me"", and when I probed a bit he said the only thing is he couldn't date someone who is pre SRS. He knows I'm trans and post SRS so idk maybe I'm reading into it. When we first met I got the sense that he was into me, and my ex at the time agreed.

Anyway nothing is going to happen because we're in a pretty small and tight friend group. And we work together every day (well until January when he will move to an office across the hall instead). I feel like even just a casual sex situation would be too messy. So I'm typing this out at 5.30am, resigned to stay pining. I haven't had a crush in years so it was a bit jarring tbh. It's just a confusing situation because I don't actually know for certain of he's into me or not either. 

It's a headfuck divas xo

I can get the flavor notes clearly, but I can’t explain to him what specific flavor he should be looking for. I’ve explained to him that he should try to focus on either bitterness, acidity, or sweetness in each sip, and then compare the coffees brewed in each of these criteria. However, he keeps saying they are the same.

My current coffees are:
- Natural Ethiopian with tasting notes of raspberry, grapes, floral.

- Natural Ugandan with tasting notes of dried fruits, pineapple, chocolate.

If you have any good way to try and explain those flavor notes please help me.

1grpe6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/GestationalDiabetes/comments/1grpe6o/new_here/,New here,"Hi! 29w4d here. I got the text from my midwife that I have GD this morning. I ordered my glucometer and inositol. Those should be arriving tomorrow 🤞

From what I understand, I will have to test for 3 days, then if my numbers are bad we will have to change my diet. I will need 4 tests a day. 

Here are some of my concerns: 

Should I be eating like I regularly do for these 3 days?? 

Literally just a couple weeks before thanksgiving!? Are you joking… Do any of you have delish dessert recipes I can make to bring to my parents? I am usually the one who makes pie, but that seems so be a no go. Or anything else to cheer me up? 

I am planning a home birth. (In the US). I am hoping some of you have a good experience with GD and home birth. This is my first pregnancy and I would really love to live out my HB dreams. Ultimately I just want a healthy happy baby, but a girl can dream! 

Walks? Are you guys walking after every meal? Like immediately? I was told to test 1 hour after my meals, but also to have a 20 minute walk after dinner. Should I be bringing my glucometer with me? Does it have to be an hour exactly? 

Guilt? I was eating like a maniac for the last 2 days, since I had a feeling I would fail the 3 hour test. Bowls of rice, sugar in my coffee, white bread, scones. Hopefully I’m not the only one who did that. I usually try to avoid reading things on the internet about pregnancy because the web is a scary place! But I’m regretting my diet, in fear of it affecting the baby negatively. Though, it wasn’t anything crazy and out of the norm. 

Obviously I will check with my midwife for all of these, just wanted to hear some other perspectives while I wait for my glucometer. 

I know this isn’t the end of the world! It’s just so early in my GD days, I feel like I’ve got no clue what’s going on! I have been so down about it today. I feel like it’s just another expense I didn’t properly account for. ☹️

2. She then went to chugly gang later on and asked avinash if he's okay and he didn't answer until she pestered him.
3. Karan didn't want to play for shilpa but she pushed him too and made him feel guilty for not playing for her. 
4. She is stringing kv along for no reason what so ever. Sometimes she has bf sometimes she doesn't. Sometimes she's with shrutika bro. But she used him nicely for footage.
5. There is a pattern with who she fights with she fought with avinash when everyone hated him to the extreme. And that too for nothing. And now with chahat. And that too for no reason.
6. She was desperate for footage.


Off notes for people who know I low key ship avinash and chahat:
- when the chahat chum cat fight was on avinash was trying not to go see what was going on he looked the other way. He said carry on fighting.
But when chahat was on the floor crying he slowly went and sat on the sofa opposite her and u could see him watching from the mirror LOL.

-when chum came to ask him if he's okay, he didn't respond clearly to her. Until she persisted and he avoided eye contact.

-chahat cried because she was disappointed with avinash when he stole from her.

-avinash asked vivian why he was giving her coffee like are u forgetting ur rivalry.

-when chahat fights with anyone they report it to avinash. His eyes shine with pride at times like when shrutika came to say chahat called baga a budhu.

-avinash got annoyed with shilpa trying to play mother hen. And chahats annoyance with baga was identical. They were frustrated nobody is playing the game properly.

-avinash was thrilled when nobody picked chahat for that pairing task. He was smiling from ear to ear.

-bb asked avinash how much he got hit sarcastically because chahat hit him the least LOL.

I'm not entirely a beginner, but I've had an on-and-off gym routine (about 3 months on, 9 months off).  However, I'm now trying to stay more consistent. I have a few ""noob"" questions:

1. Do you do any light cardio (cycling, treadmill, etc.) before or after your workout? If yes, which is better: before or after?
2. Deadlift on leg day or pull day?
3. For those who work out in the morning (before 7 am), what do you usually have as a pre-workout meal? I don't really like coffee, so I'm looking for alternatives. Right now, I usually eat 1-2 bananas or 10-12 almonds/cashews.
4. Does the timing of meals matter, or is total calorie intake more important? For example, I feel like I start losing weight if I don't eat every 3 hours, but I’m rarely able to eat that frequently. So, I just aim to hit my total calorie intake throughout the day. Is this okay, or should I be eating at regular intervals?
5. Before starting any multivitamins or other supplements (other than protein), do you get blood tests to see which supplements your body actually needs, or do you just go for common ones like multivitamins, creatine, and omega-3?
6. Do you train any muscle groups 3 times a week?
7. Which brand has better flavors: MyProtein or The Whole Truth?
8. Does anyone use steel shaker? I feel plastic ones break(atleast the cap breaks) if they fall 1-2 times.

I (39M) have been friends with a woman (37F) for a little more than 2 years. We met through mutual friends. What started off as a friendship initially involved into dating and we developed a FWB which lasted for ~6 months. It stopped a year ago and we are back to being friends. We obviously talked this whole FWB phase through, before and after, and are on good terms on that particular topic.

The thing is, I feel like I have to constantly do the legwork to keep things going. It’s been silence now for more than a week because I intentionally told myself that it’s not yet again me who reaches out if she wants to meet up for a coffee, shopping or a dinner and a movie. We were very close at times and shared lots of personal stuff with each other, she did have a bit of a rough childhood with a narcissistic mother and in general parents who were emotionally unavailable, she has never had a proper romantic relationship in her life and she has told me more than once that she would have no problem boarding a plane tomorrow and just leaving without telling anybody she knows here. Unfortunately she is a sexual abuse victim when she was a child by an extended family member. She did go to therapy in the past and recently said that she is thinking about going again. I am just mentioning this all here to give a little background to our situation.

The last time we met I told her that I would like to spend more time with her, that I think of her regularly and that I find it unfortunate that we were once closer but are currently not anymore. I shed a few tears when I said these things to her (I am very much in touch with my emotions and have no problem showing/expressing them to people close to me, the result of lots of work on myself and therapy too).

I am at a stage now where I seriously question the importance of me in her life. I want to reach out to her now, asking if she wants to meet this weekend. Last week Thursday I asked her already and she said that next week would be better so I wonder if she is actually going to reach out. I honestly don’t know what do to and what would be a healthy behavior now towards my own mental wellbeing. Should I just accept this and just keep putting more effort in than her or should I simply withdraw, wait for her to reach out and if not, slowly let this relationship die?

1grot8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1grot8d/left_a_discord_server_lost_a_friend/,Left a discord server lost a friend,"This situation has been overwhelming (everyone involved is at least 35). I was invited to a friend’s Satak, and I was excited to go. I overthought everything because I play a video game pretty intensely, as do the four other people I was going to meet in real life for the first time at this party. I’d known them online for about four years, and meeting them was all I talked about for months.

Two of the five friends hosted me at their place, and they are honestly two of the loveliest people I know. One of them, who I’ll call Trevor, was someone I considered one of my best friends—we used to have long, deep conversations about life. The second is a woman from England, who I’ll call Lucy. The groom of the Satak, I’ll call Melvin.

I tend to be shy in person, and I warned everyone that it might take me a bit to warm up. Before the party, Trevor sent me a selfie from the parking lot, and we practiced saying each other's names. But when the party started, he avoided me entirely. Every time I tried to talk to him, he walked away. He came over to chat once, but Lucy pulled him away to talk to her. During the meal, he sat at a different table.

Lucy also brought a date to the party. She greeted me quickly, then spent three hours sitting with her back to me and the two kind hosts so she could focus on her date and Trevor when she pulled him aside. The party wrapped up in the afternoon, and both Lucy and Trevor left, not to be seen again. I tried to set up a coffee meet-up with Trevor the next morning, but he declined, saying he needed to get home.

I ended up spending the rest of the evening with Melvin and his family at his parents’ house. Feeling hurt and needing time to process, I decided to leave the Discord server we all shared, since I was interacting regularly with both Lucy and Trevor there. I needed to figure out if I even wanted to speak to them again.

Three days later, I sent Trevor a direct message, and he responded by saying he didn’t want me in his life anymore because I had left the Discord server.

A month later, Melvin returned from his wedding and honeymoon. I hadn’t contacted him during that time to give him space. When he got back, I found out that between the party and his wedding, Trevor and Lucy had told him I was selfish for leaving the Discord server and expecting them to be friendly and speak to me in person. Melvin came home and yelled at me for an hour and a half.

Despite everything, Trevor and I have been trying to rebuild our friendship.

Three months later, Melvin blew up at me again over something Trevor had told him—he said I had spammed messages to the bride during their honeymoon, which I hadn’t done. I talked it over with my closer friends, and they went to Melvin to set the record straight. Now, Melvin is upset that I got mad about the rumors being spread and tried to address them. Trevor refused to tell me where he had heard the rumors and got defensive when I asked about it.

Melvin now says he wants to talk about everything and promises to have an open mind, but I’m not sure I trust that. I’m not sure what to do next.",1,1731646803.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

Most of the time I don't even buy a pack on average I would smoke about 5 a day maybe in the morning at work with my coffee hanging out with friends fishing driving or just bum a cigarette here and there get a couple singles from the street corner store. There's times when I would go weeks without smoking and there's times when I went by a whole pack so let's say about five cigarettes a day on average. 

I don't think I'm addicted to nicotine I just enjoy smoking. I know some people could smoke packs and not get affected by healthwise me personally whenever I smoke more than five cigarettes daily I catch colds get sinus infections very bad chest congestion almost like fever like symptoms. Why this is only happen to me when other people could smoke packs and be okay. Does that mean my body is cleaning itself out or it's just weak not made to smoke? 

At the moment I'm recovering from a little cold sinus thing that's caused by smoking because I had a stressful week and I bought a couple packs. I think I'm going to give it up for good.

My daily routine is pretty simple - I hop in the shower in the morning and head straight to my desk to open my laptop. Then I check Slack and Gmail before getting started with work. This keeps me focused in the morning, but the real struggle hits after lunch. I get super sleepy after eating! Such a pain. Recently, I've started taking these 30-minute power naps after lunch. Seriously, you should try it - it really helps clear your head!

Then I work until around 6 PM, but since I'm working alone at home, I catch myself mindlessly scrolling through my phone way too often.

We do work calls together, and it automatically connects when you open your laptop. Zero stress, and it gives me that coffee shop vibe where I can really focus.

After that, I grab dinner, go for a run, and take a bath. For running, I've been using this app called ""Strava"". It lets me share my running stats with friends, which keeps me motivated and helps make it a habit.

1groj98,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1groj98/when_i_became_my_ex_bosss_from_hell_who/,"When I became my, Ex boss's from Hell (who indirectly sent someone to their death) boss - this was unplanned. ","Hi All, this one is quite a long one - let's get to it!

My ex-boss, (Let's call her Karen) was INCREDIBLY notorious in our industry in ALL THE WRONG WAYS (Our industry is a giant circle, everyone knows everyone). Before I get into my revenge story (which, I didn't plan) , just for context - Let me explain: Karen, I guess, maybe is a narcissist or just loves and thrives on drama. She is the type, that has CLEAR favorites, in which, she would shower them with gifts - push them to get promoted, you name it. If you were one of her favorites, you would be very lucky to be working with her because you would definitely be going up the corporate chain VERY fast. 

AND THEN, for some reason, she also has people she dislikes FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. She will, in ALL HER POWER push the people she does not like, to quit (which, I will get into later). 

So, let me share an appetizer first: a short story as stated in my title (my ex-colleague told me this story), of how she ""Indirectly"" sent someone to their death. Karen, very much disliked a marketing employee, who we will call Anne. Karen, consistently berated Anne about her work and how it wasn't good enough, not only that, but she kept Anne from her holidays and kept her in the office, refusing to let her go home by piling up work for her (this is one of Karen's many ways of forcing someone to quit). I don't remember if Karen realized that Anne, was suffering from cancer. However, this caused unnecessary extra stress that Anne was already going through and due to the high-cost of cancer treatment, Anne, could not quit. Karen, also denied any leave for Anne. In the end, Anne could not take it anymore and eventually quit. However - due to her sickness, she was already weak and could no longer work. Without sufficient pay, Anne soon fell into depression and passed. Karen played oblivious and never mentioned, nor cared or even acknowledged Anne's passing.  

  
This all happened before I came into the company and started working with Karen. So, now comes my story. In the beginning when I started working with Karen, since I was a new employee - she didn't bother me too much. However 6 months in, 3 employees quit (one being one of my best friends now). All being pushed to the brink by her, they shared with me what she did to them (there are too many things to explain so I will share what she did to me shortly) but, since I wasn't being too bothered by the time, they also advised me to lay low for the time being. Karen, was also facing an issue, as she was the highest position for our department - that her turnover was concerning. Side note - her birthday was the exact same day as me. Office birthday parties.. \*sigh\* I was forced to hold mine with another colleague together since ours was 2 days apart, at a much earlier date, whilst hers had to be big and extravagant on the actual day. She would usually get 2 or 3 cakes from different departments.

Anyways - 9 months into working, my team would constantly yell at me and call me names, keep in mind, I was basically the admin of my team so I was the lowest position at the time. I do not condone this or even ask that anyone tolerate this, but in my culture - this happens a lot and you're expected to tolerate it. Karen's PA overheard this and went to tell Karen how awful my team was treating me. Karen called me into her office and asked me if it was true and started asking me a lot of inappropriate questions such as, ""does so and so do any work? is so and so lazy?"" etc. in which, I refused to answer and just gave her a neutral answer of either ""I don't know"" or ""they do this and that"". She then concluded the conversation and told me ""Your team will dislike you for a while but this needs to be done"". She called my team in to talk to, after that, my life was a living hell. My team were mad at me, refused to talk to me, passive aggressively mentioned me and were sarcastically saying that ""IM LAZY SO I NEED TO DO THIS MYSELF"". The works. This continued for around a month. Later on Second in command under Karen, Alex, called me in to ask what actually happened and what Karen talked to me about. I told him everything and what the conversation went like - he then honestly told me, that's not what the team said. They said, Karen had told my team that I had ratted them out, calling them lazy and not doing any work. I WAS FUMING. But bless Alex's soul, he saved my life many times and in this case - he talked to all my team members individually and the issue was solved.. temporarily at least. 

A couple of months had passed. I was actively looking are a new job, as you probably know why.  During the period of looking for a new job, I would constantly get called into the office where Karen, would often yell at me for doing my job horribly. In which, many of the things she yelled at me wasn't even part of my job description - it was the manager's job, but the manager was her golden child so he was untouchable. By all means, I wasn't perfect, I made mistakes but, my other colleagues, who also made the same mistakes never got called in or even got a warning.

Finally, I got a new job and higher position, at another brand within our company (For context, I don't want to share the specific industry since I want to be completely anonymous, but how my company works - we are a large global company that has many brands and chains under them, by being affiliated to the company, it is easier to internally transfer to another brand/chain as opposed to outsiders applying). This specific position that I got, I was not looking after only 1 brand, but 3 different brands/chains. Shortly after signing the contract and having a couple of weeks left, Karen wanted to ""talk to me"" - she asked if I would like to go to another ""lesser brand"" instead, she said she was close to the leader in that department and would be happy to refer me. She said she was concerned that 3 brands would be too much for me to handle. Of course, I ""politely"" declined.

After FINALLY leaving and starting my new work place, suffice to say - I did very well. I got internally promoted to another higher position and consistently overachieved my annual goals. Even after all this, I still heard news from some of my ex-colleagues about Karen. Karen also left and got another job offer, still within the same company - same position but different country and brand. I didn't care too much, but just glad she was out of site. 

It's not over yet. BIG FULL CIRCLE moment. After 5 years, of taking care of 3 brands, I applied and got a Global Corporate position in the same company. The biggest difference in this job scope, is that I am now overlooking all the different brands and chains all around the world and I am able to influence which, brands/chains the client chooses. The pros of this position is that you are highly influential to all the brands/chains and they need to be in good terms with you, since, it's similar to being a consultant - I can bring big bucks to them. A big email was sent to all the associates and leaders around the world notifying them of my position (my big smug smiley face was in the email as well). I know, I thought about Karen now looking at my picture and how she feels that I have power to take her clients to other brands HEHEHEHE, but I'm still professional so I wouldn't do that.. or would I? 

Anywho, a couple of the brand/chain leaders came to visit my country and asked if they could meet up with me for coffee, I accepted and talked some business with them. Shortly after, they needed to leave since they needed to go visit some clients with one more colleague, who didn't ""have time"" to meet me. IM SURE YOU CAN GUESS WHO THAT WAS, So from the lobby, I took them to their car and there was Karen, sitting by herself on the lobby couch. I, OF COURSE, went over to hug Karen, with a HUGE greeting and the biggest SMUG smile on my face. Her face was white as a ghost, a very forced smile and high pitched ""how areee youuu.."" - won't share too much of the conversation since a lot of it was fake talk hahaha, but she still held her ground and stated, she didn't want to come down to meet me since she already ""knew"" me - fair. Throughout the whole conversation, not once did she congratulate me nor state she was happy for me. But now, I can make her life a living hell if I wanted. Just seeing how embarrassed and how I managed to break her fragile ego was enough revenge for me. 

I, of course am a professional when it comes to work, so I will not be mean to her anytime soon. I do believe in killing people with kindness and good karma.

1groije,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamondsreview/comments/1groije/2_carat_diamond_guide_expert_tips_for_smart_buying/,2 Carat Diamond Guide: Expert Tips for Smart Buying,"A 2 carat diamond measures 8.1mm in diameter and commands prices from $5,000 to $55,000 for natural stones, while lab-grown alternatives start at just $2,500. Market analysis shows this size represents the top 15% of natural diamond engagement ring purchases, signaling a significant luxury investment.

The price differential between natural and lab-grown is most dramatic at this carat weight, with lab-grown options offering up to 85% savings. Recent data indicates that 2.00 carat lab-grown diamonds have become the fastest-growing segment in the luxury engagement ring market, with sales increasing 140% year-over-year.

This comprehensive guide details strategies for navigating the 2.00 carat diamond market, including specific price breakdowns by quality grade and expert recommendations for maximizing value at this luxury price point.



# Bottom Line

When shopping for a 2-carat diamond, keep these crucial points in mind:

* Carat refers to weight, not size. A 2.00 carat diamond's appearance varies by shape and cut quality.
* Prioritize the Four C's: cut, color, clarity, and carat. Excellent cut is vital for maximum brilliance.
* Price range: $5,000 to $55,000+ for natural diamonds depending on the overall quality of the stone
* The 2.00 carat lab-grown diamond segment has seen exceptional growth, with prices ranging from $2,500-$5,000 making these statement sizes accessible to buyers who traditionally considered only sub-carat natural diamonds.
* Remember, the larger you go, the easier it is to see the flaws. Get clarity of VS2 minimum and make sure it is eye-clean.
* Always choose GIA or AGS certified natural diamonds and IGI or GIA lab-grown diamonds for reliable grading.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing from trusted retailers that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

I was 29, visiting for vacation with friends, eager to explore the city and unwind. One afternoon, as we relaxed in a coffee shop, a friend convinced me to download Bumble. We laughed as we swiped left and right with no real intention of meeting anyone—until I matched with Takumi. He was 30, a Japanese guy in town for work. His last night in Singapore, he explained, as he was heading to Malaysia the next day for another business stop.

There was an instant spark in our conversation, and in an impulsive decision, we agreed to meet that very afternoon. We set our meeting point at a shoe store, a casual spot that somehow suited the spontaneity of it all. I arrived first, feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness as I spotted him before he saw me. Takumi had a calm, collected presence, and I found myself hesitating, unable to make the first move. But when our eyes finally met, his warm smile put me at ease, and I walked over to meet him.

We started at a nearby coffee shop, where he treated me to a cup of coffee. Conversation flowed effortlessly as we shared stories about our lives—my carefree vacation, his busy travel schedule, and how we ended up in Singapore. After a few minutes, he asked if I’d like to grab some drinks, and I agreed, feeling an easy comfort with him. Soon, we were in a Grab heading to a restaurant along the Singapore River.

The restaurant had a lively, open-air vibe with the river running alongside. Over drinks, we continued to talk. We talked about the places we wanted to visit, his life in Japan, and my life back home. Eventually, we decided to take a walk along the river. The heat was intense, so Takumi stopped at a 7-Eleven to buy us a bottle of water. We found a quiet bench overlooking the river, where we sat, letting the evening settle around us.

Sitting there in the heat, my heart raced—not just from the temperature but from how he looked at me. He reached for my hand, and it felt so natural, as if we had done it a thousand times before. At some point, he leaned closer, and our first kiss happened there by the riverside, the world fading out around us. It was brief, but it felt as if it held a world of its own.

We eventually had to part ways; my friends were waiting, and I had the key to our hotel room. We lingered a bit longer, not wanting to let go of that moment. We exchanged goodbyes, neither of us wanting it to end but knowing it had to.

We kept in touch now and then, exchanging messages and memories, though the distance and our lives often got in the way. I still find myself wondering about him, hoping that one day, our paths will cross again.",1,1731645464.0,DatingApps,0,1.0,False

Been working in Lansing the past couple months and wanted to share my favorite things about the city.

-Horrocks is probably the best grocery store I’ve ever visited. Thai food truck, beer garden, and chocolate selection are top notch.

-Bar scene is impressive. Dagwoods, Stobers, & Crunchys are all gems with character.

-Most frequented restaurants are One North, Cask & Co and Soup Spoon Cafe. Never had a bad meal.

-Big fan of Strange Matter coffee. The Nasty AF potato’s from Bangos at the downtown location are A+.

-Woldumar and Fenner nature centers were nice scenic walks during the fall.

-Old Town Lansing is my fav lil neighborhood I’ve checked out here. Meat and Zoobies were both great options in the area.

1grod0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkred/comments/1grod0v/sets_of_challenges/,Sets of Challenges,"First off, if the names Stitch, Bear, Solstice and Scout ring a bell for you, then scram. This post is not for you.

For everyone else, I've got an idea to put my PCs through a ringer to get them a thing one of them wants. The things I'm specifically thinking about are what challenges to put in front of them, and how to make spectating interesting. I need some help spicing these challenges up.

One the PCs, an Exec, is a little camera-shy. I was going to offer biosculpting as a way to disguise himself (thanks, *Devil's Cut* adventure!), but also that if he didn't want to participate, he could find ways to wreak havoc behind the scenes. 

**Setup:** This is part of a game show called *Naked & Afraid*. The PCs get dropped into a gauntlet of challenges and must complete them in a set amount of time. They have no gear, no weapons, and no clothing besides underwear - it's just them and whatever chrome they've chipped in. The stakes are life and death. 

**Krang:** The PCs have limited time to complete this mission. Krang is a full-body conversion who will chase them through the obstacles (stats as **cyberpsycho** with FBC traits). The PCs have a 10 minute head start. Because Krang isn't being paid to hurry, he takes 5 minutes per room to pursue the PCs. Once the PCs reach room 5, he takes 30 seconds to clear each room. The PCs know Krang will be released, and that he way outclasses them.

**Twist:** Obviously the studio execs want to see people splatter, but not until the end so you get people invested. The last room is rigged against the PCs, and the execs are trying to get at least one person killed.

**Room 1: Splatterball -** A rectangular room, about 20m long x 10m wide. The walls and floor are bone white tile and the only things audible are the hushed breath of the audience and the MC's cry of ""LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLE!"" There's a pedestal about halfway down the room, holding an orb about the size of a bowling ball. 

* The pedestal holding the orb is marked by several deep cuts and is covered in thick sprays of dried blood. 
   * The orb is surrounded by several small laser tripwires, invisible unless you have UV / IR / LL vision. Getting around the tripwires requires Contortionist DV 11.
   * Grabbing the orb without being able to see the tripwires guarantees the tripwires are triggered, which causes a huge pendulum blade to drop directly at the offending PC (as Very Heavy Melee Weapon, DV 16 Evasion dodges). It retracts immediately; there are three such blades that can attack per round. 
* There's a door at the far end of the room. It is locked and made of Thick Steel Cover; only an orb-like depression is visible in the doorframe.
   * Placing the orb in the depression unlocks and opens the door to Room 2: Blind Archers
* Searching the room hastily takes 5 minutes and requires a successful DV 15 Conceal / Reveal Object check
   * Result 16 - 17: A fake panel in the wall, hiding a machete (as PQ Heavy Melee Weapon)
   * Result 18+: As above, and another fake panel hiding a coffee can of non-dairy creamer (as grenade, but requires an open flame)

**Room 2: Blind Archers -** A large square room about 30m x 30m, with no cover, brightly lit. Several dead bodies are strewn about. It is flat, except for a 10m x 10m area centered in the middle that's raised 2m above the rest of the room. In the middle of the raised area stand three statues holding bows, facing outwards. There is a door at the far end, but a large blinking device the size of a refrigerator blocks it. The MC asks the crowd to please be quiet.

* The three ""statues"" look like blindfolded archers. They are actually turrets operating bows. The Archers each have 30 arrows of ammunition. They are programmed to fire at any sound louder than a whisper, and have no visual targeting method.
   * They cannot fire into the crowd
   * Stealth DV 13 (every time the PCs take a potentially noisy action) to avoid being targeted, but the Archers only have ROF 1.
   * Combat Number 14, even those characters who can't dodge bullets can try to dodge these arrows.
   * Archer HP: 30 (each), SP 0; each can fire in all directions.
   * All spaces on the dais are rigged with loud noisemakers - stepping on the dais automatically triggers an attack from all Archers who haven't acted yet this round.
   * Each Archer has a key to disarm the bomb at the far end of the room, and another key to open the door to Room 3: The Floor Is Lava
* Searching the dead bodies hastily takes 1 minute and requires a DV 13 Conceal / Reveal Object check. This is potentially noisy (DV 13 Stealth to avoid drawing fire from the Blind Archers)
   * DV 14 - 15: PQ Medium Pistol with 5 rounds of ammunition
   * DV 16 - 17: Zippo lighter (windproof)
   * DV 18 - 19+: PQ double-barreled shotgun with 1 slug and 1 shell
* The large refrigerator-sized object is a massive bomb, rigged on a 10 minute timer. Without tools, it would require a DV 24 Demolitions check to disarm it. With tools, it would require a DV 17 Demolitions check to disarm it.
   * Detonation sends shrapnel across the whole area, DV 15 Evasion check to avoid (4d6 damage)
   * Archers can be used as human shields and absorb all damage
   * Can be disarmed with the key from one of the archers and a single action
* The door to Room 3: The Floor Is Lava is locked, and cannot be opened without a key or an Electronics / Security Tech check (DV 24 without tools, DV 17 with)

**Room 3: The Floor Is Lava -** This room about 40m long and 20m wide. It is full of enormous carvings and obstacles. The floor is badly burned and charred. The door out is at the far end, about halfway up the far wall. A catwalk leads to it. As the PCs walk in, the door shuts behind them, and a strange liquid begins to be pumped in, appearing in color and viscosity similar to a lava lamp. The level rises quickly.

* The liquid is a potent acid. Falling in it deals 3d6 damage and ablates any armor by 2 points. 
   * The liquid rises at a rate of 1m per minute; the liquid does not stop until it has filled up to 12m above the ground.
   * The highest cover in the room is the catwalk, which is 10m above the ground.
* The large carvings and obstacles can be climbed as normal, with a DV 13 Athletics check needed if in doubt.
* The catwalk is in poor repair.
   * Whenever a character leaps on catwalk, there is a 1-in-6 chance that the catwalk floor panel they leapt on falls down; DV 13 Evasion check for the character to catch themselves.
   * Whenever a character leaps on the catwalk, a turret descends from above the doorway out and starts firing at any characters on the catwalk (as Medium Pistol firing rubber bullets, Combat Number 13)
   * The catwalk begins collapsing as soon as the door is unlocked (each character has a 1-in-6 chance for their catwalk panel to collapse as detailed above).
* The door to Room 4: Baller Derby is locked (DV 24 Electronics / Security Tech check to unlock without tools, DV 17 with tools)
   * There is a key on the floor underneath the catwalk, but getting to requires swimming in acid for 2 rounds unless the PCs get creative.
* Searching the room hastily a takes 1 minute and requires a DV 15 Conceal / Reveal Object check.
   * DV 16 - 17: Tech tools
   * DV 18 - 19: Set of Light Armorjack
   * DV 20 - 21+: 1 taser with single charge (can also be used to short out any electrical system with an Action)

**Room 4: Baller Derby -** This room is a circle, about 20m in diameter. The walls are perfectly smooth mirrored glass, and several blood splatters on the floor indicate where previous contestants have experienced bad luck. In the middle of the room, perfectly balanced on a spindle, is a massive black iron ball, about 6m in diameter. There is no door out.

* The way out is one of the sections of mirrored glass on the east side of the room. Tapping the glass reveals this section to be hollow.
   * It requires 30 points of damage to break the glass; there is no door handle or lock to pick
   * Once smashed, it leads to Room 5: Is It Dead?
* The black iron ball in the middle can be levered out of its spindle-holder by pushing it; no check is required. It will roll gently towards the walls
* The walls that aren't the way out have powerful electromagnets to repulse the iron ball
   * When the ball hits a magnetized wall section, it rockets towards the other side of the room; choose one character in the room and have them make a DV 11 Evasion check to get out of the way
   * Anything hit by the ball takes 30 points of damage but no critical injury is possible; this damage is absorbed by armor.
   * Every time the ball hits two sections of wall that accelerate it, it returns to resting in the middle of the room.
   * There is a 1-in-10 chance each time the PCs lever the ball out of the spindle that it hits the exit wall section
   * If the PCs are using the ball deliberately to target sections of the wall, it takes 1 minute but requires no check to evade the ball

**Room 5: Is It Dead? -** This room is a well-staged charnel house. Five dead bodies sit on chairs in a line in front of the PCs. Each of them has an identical key around their neck. There is no door out.

* The air in this room is slightly toxic; everyone needs to make a DV 13 Resist Torture / Drugs check or take a -1 penalty to all checks. 
* Corpse #1. Far right. Appears to be a well-burnt young woman. 
   * Actually a flamethrower disguised in a dead flash-clone. Interacting with the body or the key at all triggers a flamethrower (Combat Number 13) that targets the person in front of the body and anyone in a 3m x 3m area around them. 
   * Basic Tech DV 21 spots the flamethrower's fuel nozzle hidden in the chair leg and can kink it. Doing so takes 30 seconds.
* Corpse #2. Middle right. Dead businessman with a bullet wound between his eyes. 
   * Biotoxin bomb disguised in a mortician's dummy. Any MedTech can determine this is not a real dead person, no check required. 
   * Interacting with the body or the key triggers a BioToxin grenade; a DV 13 Demolitions check and 1 minute can disarm the bomb
* Corpse #3. Middle. Appears to be one of the PCs. 
   * Electrocution trap disguised in a mortician's dummy. Any MedTech can determine this is not a real dead person, no check required. 
   * Interacting with the body or the key electrocutes the person doing so; a DV 13 Basic Tech check and 1 minute can deactivate the trap
* Corpse #4: Middle left. Appears to be a dead homeless person.
   * Actually a live homeless person dosed to the gills on a paralytic. Currently afflicted with rabies. DV 21 First Aid to recognize that they're alive.
   * No trap.
* Corpse #5: Far left. Appears to be a mannequin.
   * Actually a plasticized corpse, and the only actual dead person here. DV 21 First Aid to recognize that they're a corpse
   * Skin covered in a fine toxin, touching the body or the key triggers a poison (as Poison Ammunition) that's absorbed through the skin.
* Once all five keys have been seized, the door out is revealed; all five keys must be used to unlock it. 
   * Using each key takes an Action

**Spectating:**

The audience can buy things for the participants:

Light Armorjack: 500 eb

PQ Medium Pistol: 500 eb

Bottle of synthbourbon: 100 eb

Techtool: 1,000 eb

5 rounds of ammunition for all carried items: 100 eb

Dose of synthcoke: 100 eb

Dose of Black Lace: 100 eb

In addition, each room has a control center, where the PCs are monitored during that room. The staff move from room to room as the PCs go along, so any rooms the PCs haven't visited yet are empty.

In one minute per control room, a PC investigating can find:

* Locations of all potentially findable items (no check necessary to search the room, assume the best results if the PCs choose to search the room)
* Nature of one trap or hazard in that room

1gro8ay,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1gro8ay/aita_for_not_inviting_my_best_friend_to_my_wedding/,AITA For Not Inviting My Best Friend To My Wedding?,"throwaway since my best friend knows about my main account

My (24F) best friend (27F) Sarah got married two years ago. We live in the United States but are both second-generation immigrants. In our culture, it’s common to have several wedding events. There are two main events that are considered “crucial”: the actual wedding, and then the reception. These typically happen a few days apart. For the past couple years, the “trend” among young women our age (mainly influencers) has been to have an intimate wedding with only close friends and family, and then invite everyone else to the reception. I’ve been to a few weddings (mostly my closest friends) of this type and it’s honestly worked out really well. I plan to do the same for my wedding.

Now, Sarah and I have known each other since I was 12 and she was 15. Our families were close and once I started high school, we became closer as well. As teenage girls do, we would constantly talk about our future weddings. I mean, we made Pinterest boards and constantly updated them. Both of us had other best friends too (our friend groups didn’t really intermix because of our age difference,) but neither of us talked about weddings/marriage like this with our other friends. I don’t want to make it seem like I’m assuming what she was thinking: Sarah made it very clear that I was the only one who she shared this sort of stuff with. All that to say, we were each other’s confidants about our love lives. She told me EVERYTHING.

As I said before, Sarah got married two years ago. I was the first person she told (outside of her immediate family). Naturally, I was *thrilled*. I was involved in the wedding planning from the very start. A few months before her wedding, however, she told me I wasn’t invited to her wedding.

I didn’t make a fuss about it (throwing a tantrum in front of the bride is NOT it) but I did ask her why. Sarah told me that her parents wanted her to keep it to only family, so I let it go. I was upset about it (and honestly quite hurt) but it wasn’t my day.

Two weeks before the wedding, one of Sarah’s other best friends, Hannah, told me she was invited to the wedding. I don’t think Hannah realized I wasn’t invited and honestly just said it randomly (she was talking about the dress she’d picked out for the evening). Hannah’s ENTIRE family was invited too. I was shocked. I asked Hannah who else was invited, and she said that Sarah’s other best friend’s entire family had been invited too. 

At this point, we were two weeks out from the wedding and the situation was just too much. I didn’t really say anything to Sarah, as she was busy enough. Around a month after her wedding, I asked her about it. She told me her parents had decided who to invite, and since both Hannah and the other friend’s families were so close to Sarah’s, her parents had decided to invite them. I didn’t tell her, but I was frustrated that her parents were deciding everything. I could tell Sarah didn’t really see an issue with it, so I just let it go.

Now, two years later, my wedding is only a month away. Sarah doesn’t live in our hometown anymore (she moved away with her husband a year ago) but she flew in three days ago to visit her parents. I met her yesterday just to talk, and my wedding came up. I have always been clear (even well before Sarah’s wedding) that I will be inviting my close friends to my wedding. I told her I was not inviting her to my wedding. She looked shocked and asked me why, since she knew several of our mutual friends were invited. I didn’t tell her that it was because I hadn’t been to hers, but it was implied. I could tell this hurt Sarah’s feelings. She said I was being petty and stupid, and her wedding was two years ago. I told her if she didn’t consider me close enough to have at her wedding, I didn’t consider her close enough to have her at mine.

She left the coffee shop we were at really annoyed, and she hasn't reached out to me since. A few friends have reached out to me about it, so she's clearly told someone because I haven't mentioned it to anyone yet.

That was yesterday and I’m still thinking about it. Some of my friends say I’m not in the wrong, but others say I’m being petty for no reason, and it was Sarah's parents who decided not to invite me. So AITA?",1,1731644752.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

I'll try and keep this short but as y'all know, I never do. Its been one of hell of a journey so far. The amount of obstacles the team has overcome has been nothing short of incredible.

TLDR: We made a website tracker so you can see how many models we have shipped. This is just another step we do to ensure 100% transparency with our community. You can see our progress here:

[https://gscroll.us/GS-Kickstarter-Fulfillment](https://gscroll.us/GS-Kickstarter-Fulfillment)

**Few admin updates:**

* We have begun shipping as of 11/13/2024!
* As we mentioned earlier, we are starting with the STUDIO models first while we wait for the PRO boxes to clear customs. Currently, the PRO boxes are scheduled to ship to us from overseas next week and are expected to arrive at our facility by December 2nd. Please note these are estimates, so the timeline might vary by a few days. Once we receive the PRO boxes, we will begin shipping the PRO models.
* The STUDIO boxes will arrive in unbranded Uline packaging. They are packed neatly and securely to ensure they reach your doorstep without any damage.
* Both the STUDIO and PRO models will be shipped via UPS Ground, and you’ll receive a tracking number via email
* As holiday package theft is a growing concern, please be mindful of potential thieves. We recommend being home when your package is delivered. Unfortunately, we cannot be held responsible if your package is stolen. If this happens, we will file a claim with UPS, which will require a full police report.
* After extensive negotiation, we secured a great deal on shipping pickups. Most units will be delivered within two days of being shipped.

I’ve been eager to share this update. This has been 11 months of relentless work—14+ hours a day, 7 days a week. No exaggeration.

All we ask, is be patient. Our team is running on coffee and takeout. We understand everyone is eager and we promise we are doing our absolute best to get every single scroll out by Christmas.

**GLANCE SCROLL IN THE WILD**

* As we've mentioned we've started shipping our units. Here's a cool video of the GLANCE SCROLL in action for a DYI mancave jumbotron. Loving the creativity of the community so far and we cant wait to see your GLANCE SCROLL in your cave!

[DIY Man Cave GLANCE SCROLL Ticker](https://reddit.com/link/1gro818/video/1elshajcsz0e1/player)

That's it for now. I'm sure we'll get feedback from users as the STUDIO models get delivered early next week.

What were we 
 
Met her a year ago and chatted a lot . Great friends,sharing everything,doing everything together and after my breakup ( happened 7 months before meeting her ) was just a wave of happiness in my life . She would hold my arms ,sleep on my shoulder say I am cute, sundar and all that and I told her she was beautiful too .
She jokingly said a couple of time "" I can be your gf if you want ,but idk if you can handle my tantrums  though""  ,and I said we could try but it always ended us going nowhere.

Went out on coffee dates. Planned a lot of trips together . Walked her dog together every single morning.
Chatted regularly but since she was trying for a  job(army) and was ruled out in medical(Due to some bone alignment which she did not knew about ).She was devastated. I met her the very next day after the results .She hugged me and  cried till my shirt was drenched with her tears .I tried my best to console her and after a hour or so she said let's just go out for coffee . We did go but instead of stopping at our regular shop she said just let's go further and far as possible.

 And after two hours we just stopped at a spot sat there watched the sunset , ate some cookies and when I dropped her near her home she hugged me again bit me multiple times and said I am gonna work hard and left .

Reached home had dinner and recieved a text . ""Bigadna mat Varna bht marungi ,dhyan rkna  "" and poof all her socials gone , I called her, the phone was off . Met her elder brother at gym and chatted around the topic and he told that she tore all her army posters and is going to start preparing for upsc atleast for the next couple of years and is planning to go to one of her relatives away from home. 


And 2 months have passed , got to know she has enrolled in a  coaching institute  . Still no contact . I feel like my dumbass should have said something on that sunset ride. 

She was always a brilliant student and I know she will do great in her life . I just feel something I can't describe at the moment.

It was just a story and I just wanted to rant about it but it is making me more sad .


But I do hope I meet her again someday and see her happy with everything she ever wanted
!
