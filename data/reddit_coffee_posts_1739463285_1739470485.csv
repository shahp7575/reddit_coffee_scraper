I have a grind n brew that I've used for 10 years, but I'm just frustrated with constantly washing the grind module.... The flaw is that it's inside the whole unit, so steam gets into it and cakes it all up ... So you have to wash and dry it fully before using again.

I just bought I nice grinder, so wondering what coffee maker y'all recommend that is just a basic drip large carafe brewer.

Hey there! Miss Simplitty here. 👋

So picture this: a shy IT nerd who used to get anxious ordering coffee somehow ends up becoming a tour guide in Turkey and traveling solo across multiple countries. Yeah, that's me! 😅 After four years of leading tours (and many embarrassing language mishaps later), I thought I'd share my favorite budget destinations that won't murder your bank account in 2025.

Quick background: I'm that person who once packed 7 pairs of shoes for a weekend trip (rookie mistake!) and accidentally ordered ""dancing tomatoes"" instead of a Greek salad. But you know what? Those awkward moments led to some of my best travel stories!

**Here's where you can travel like a queen on a ramen budget:**

🇹🇷 **Turkey** (my second home)

* $25-35/day all in
* Pro tip: Learn to say ""çok güzel"" (very beautiful) and watch locals light up
* Funny story: I once got so lost in Antalya's old town that I ended up in this tiny courtyard where an elderly lady basically adopted me for the day and taught me how to make proper Turkish coffee. Best ""wrong turn"" ever!
* Stay in Kaleici (old town) - hostels are $10-15/night
* Local food is CRAZY cheap (like $3-5 for a proper meal)

🇵🇱 **Poland** (urban explorer's dream)

* $30-40/day
* Those colorful buildings in Gdansk? Even better in person!
* Find ""milk bars"" for cheap local food that's actually amazing

🇬🇷 **Greece** (yes, it can be budget-friendly!)

* $30-40/day if you're smart about it
* Off-season is your best friend (September-October)
* That ""dancing tomatoes"" incident? Got me a free meal AND a dance lesson
* Island hopping tip: local ferries > tourist boats

🇪🇬 **Egypt** (Red Sea magic)

* $35-45/day
* Hurghada in off-season is INSANELY cheap
* All-inclusive resorts sometimes cost less than hostels in Western Europe
* Just... maybe learn from my mistake and don't try to bargain for ""three"" carpets when you meant ""one"" 🙈

🇪🇸 **Spain** (Western Europe on a budget? Yep!)

* $40-50/day
* Free tapas with drinks in many places
* My introverted hack: Free walking tours to meet people without the awkward hostel small talk

**Random tips from someone who learned everything the hard way:**

1. That comfort zone? It's more like a comfort suggestion
2. Pack half of what you think you need (your back will thank me later)
3. Google Maps offline downloads = lifesaver
4. Hostels aren't scary (coming from someone who used to get anxious about sharing a bathroom)
5. Local SIM cards > international plans

**For my fellow introverts:** You don't need to become an extrovert to travel solo! I still need my quiet time and sometimes eat dinner in my hostel bed watching Netflix. It's totally okay!

**Embarrassing moments that turned out great:**

* Accidentally joining a Turkish wedding (they insisted I stay!)
* Getting lost in Rhodes and ending up at a local family's Sunday lunch
* Taking the wrong bus in Warsaw and discovering the best pierogies ever
* That time I tried to order water in Spanish and asked for a ""dancing fish"" instead

EDIT 1: For those asking about safety - yes, all these places are solo female traveler friendly IF you use common sense. Trust your gut, don't do stupid stuff, and remember Google Translate is your best friend!

Burger King used to actually be good and didn't use cardboard during the 90s, even that bad here that kept burning down. But like when Coke stopped using sugar, the quality of the product went down a lot while prices increased. Since covid they have gotten greedy and got into thinking they can price gouge like Krogar does.

So, these places are going under for sure. It's not affordable and people around here don't make a lot of money unless they work all day for Carilion.

It used to be banks that would take over most of these properties but i think people finally gotten wise against credit unions(good luck if you have had your account hacked and need help on the weekend).

Coffee shops then took over a lot of fallen banks but that stopped too. Now the trend is the big properties such as Kmart turns into storage and small ones are car washes- which I don't get how the carwashes are constantly busy, even when it's cold.

I'm just curious- what do you think might overtake storage and carwashes next in taking over these soon to fail fast food chains? ? Sounds silly but I picture Walmart getting in on the gas business more and not being afraid to put them right next to Krogar gas stations- who tried to put a lot of convenance stores under by opening next to them but never did .

[Location - UK]
[Level of experience - new to brewing/roasting]

Hi all,

Not sure if this is the right sub but figured I'd try my case, as I'm not sure how to fix this problem.

A few months ago, I bought my first espresso machine - a John Lewis espresso machine with a milk frother built into the machine. It was wonderful to begin with, but as of the last two weeks, it's not been frothing the milk as it should. 

The machine ought to pull the milk directly from the reservoir, froth it and deposit it into the cup through the attached spout (see above for picture). However, it's been pretty much taking the milk and dumping it into the mug, the same way it went in...

I've tried to remedy the problem according to the manual - I've chilled the reservoir prior to use, made sure I'm using only whole milk, cleaned the tubing and the milk wand with everything under the sun (plain water, soap and water, descaling solution, 1% white vinegar).

I've also tried swapping the water used in the rear reservoir from tap water to filter water and bottled water, since we live in a hard water area, but nothing changed (except the espresso tasted nicer).

At the moment, the only coffee I can make is espresso and that's fine for me but it means I can't make things like cappuccinos when guests come over.

I'm running out of ideas and I'm not in a position to replace it with a whole new machine or milk frother so any advice would be appreciated.",0,1739470078.0,espresso,0,0.33,False

Later when we were paying the check, he said I will pay this and you pay for the coffee. I thought he's asking me to pay things and I don't like this being said. I already pay it without him telling me. I told him that money isn't important between us. He said ""I said it for you not to feel ashamed cuz I pay. You thinking about this makes me believe even more that you are obsessed. You need to apologize now cuz you said this"" I felt so bad and I apologized. Later I felt distant and I was already feeling bad, I didn't want to do anything. He wanted to make out,  I told him to drop me home cuz I have a low mood today.  He asked me what's wrong. I said I don't know and I just want to go home. He kept asking what's wrong I said I don't know.

I am very fortunate to have a great income and still feel like my money disappears. I have categorized my 2024 spending into categories below and would love to see where you all think expenses can be cut. Feeling wise, I would say I do feel like I live a comfortable life, but I am far from eating out whenever I want, traveling wherever I want, etc. which I feel like a lot of my peers do. I struggle with the comparing, not gonna lie. 

Income on my 2024 return was $85k. I got a raise in January and my 2025 income will be $130k. 

2024 average monthly spending: 

Rent - $1,146

Furniture - $232

Internet- $58

Storage/Apple Music - $11 

Electric - $80

Groceries - $210

Target - $50

Restaurants - $112

Bars - $125

Fast Food - $127

Coffee - $33

Alcohol - $28

Gas - $67

Auto Service - $94

Uber - $32

Tolls - $14

Student Loans - $250

Medical/Dental - $20

Auto Insurance - $176

Pet - $230

Personal Care - $55

Clothes - $83

Amazon - $256 (this is mostly clothes/home needs..I moved into a house this year)

Gifts - $80

Concerts/Entertainment - $159

Fitness - $120

Travel - $270 

This totals ~$4,118/mo which just feels insane. I take home $7,200 so saving about $3k a month. Feels like I should be able to do much better than that. 

I contribute 10% to my Roth 401k and fully fund my Roth IRA. There were some large purchases in there driving the monthly average up which likely won’t repeat (furniture, fitness), but not sure spending will necessarily be any lower as I’m sure they’ll just be replaced with other large expenses in different categories. 

The pet category is particularly high as I have a doodle that has to be groomed which is pricy, but not interested in doing it myself. Travel is high as my family lives away so flying home for holidays is expensive and not something I want to cut back on. 

Recently bought a new car which is $510/mo. Ideally hoping to cut back on above expenses to make total monthly expenditures a wash.

Rich, buttery, and delightfully crumbly, this traditional shortbread is a timeless treat that pairs perfectly with tea or coffee.



✅ Unsalted butter, softened – 225 g

✅ Granulated sugar – 100 g

✅ All-purpose flour – 250 g

✅ Salt – 1 g



Preheat your oven to 170°C (340°F) and line a baking tray with parchment paper.

In a large mixing bowl, beat together the softened butter and sugar until light and creamy.

Gradually add the flour and salt, mixing until the dough comes together.

Roll the dough out onto a floured surface to about 1 cm thick, then cut into your desired shape (traditionally fingers or rounds).

Place the cut dough onto the baking tray and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are just beginning to turn golden.

Allow the shortbread to cool on a wire rack before enjoying.

This extension helps you secure a slot faster by continuously refreshing the page. Initially, you should practice using the bot without enabling the **auto-book** feature. If you book too quickly without understanding the system, you might accidentally get an appointment far in the future (like I did, with a **2-year delay**). Once you're comfortable, you can enable the auto-booking to increase your chances of securing an appointment.
2. **Use Multiple Windows for Faster Slot Checking** The extension checks appointments only every **30 seconds**, so to speed up the process, you can **open multiple windows** on your browser. I recommend using **3 to 4 windows**—each window will check the slots every 10 seconds, giving you a better chance to grab an appointment before others. Going over 4 windows doesn’t significantly improve your chances and could slow down the system.
3. **Get Unlimited Credits by Buying Coffee** The ASI Rescheduler extension gives you **limited credits**, but you can unlock **unlimited credits** by **buying a coffee through the developer’s link**. This small contribution helps support the tool and gives you more opportunities to secure an appointment. It's worth it if you're serious about getting a slot.
4. **Beware of Ghost Slots and Handle Them Properly** Sometimes, the system shows a **ghost slot**, which appears available but cannot actually be booked. If you find yourself repeatedly seeing the **same date** (e.g., March 5th) without successfully booking it, it’s likely a ghost slot designed to trap users. If this happens, simply **change the date** (e.g., switch to March 6th or later) and keep looking for a real slot.
5. **Booking and Restrictions** Once you find an available slot, book it quickly. In my experience, I used **3 windows**. Two of them showed ghost slots for the same date, but in the **third window**, I found a **real available slot** and booked it quickly before anyone else could grab it. However, be cautious not to overuse the extension because the website might temporarily block you from accessing the slots, or even **ban your IP** for 24 hours. Use the extension wisely and strategically to avoid getting blocked.
6. **Rescheduling Fees** If you make a mistake and book a date far in the future, you may need to **reschedule**. While it was free for me when I first used it, **rescheduling now comes with a fee** due to updated rules. So, it’s important to double-check everything before confirming your booking.

I’ve cut out processed sugar and processed carbs for a while, sticking to a keto style diet - did great and lost A-LOT of weight in the autumn. I had a break from the medicine due to requiring surgery. I’m back on 5mg, and carb and sugar cravings are now surfacing , I want pasta and ice cream of an evening! Not sure I could actually eat much of its but it’s annoying me. I eat clean in the day coffees, herbal teas, eggs, meat or fish and salad then boom 8pm I want carbs and sugar which is annoying me - I take my vitamins an stay hydrated. I want to ask does anyone else have these cravings? I hadn’t for a while and thought they’d be gone!",1,1739469416.0,mounjarouk,0,1.0,False
1iop2vj,https://i.redd.it/a391urvl3yie1.jpeg,Review: Pharm to Table Vanilla Almond scent,"I feel like I hit the jackpot with these finds. Pharm to Table Vanilla Almond smells like a cross between gingerbread cookies and coffee cake. I could see how one would smell speculoos, the spiced shortbread cookie as well. The Body Butter (with the rubbed-off faux wood veneer from the plastic cap) was on red tag clearance for $4.50. It is the texture of lotion rather than a creamy body butter, but it absorbs into the skin without a greasy feel. I got the body lotion for full price $6.99. It is slightly thinner than the body butter. I use it as a hand cream. The calming comfort shower gel was reduced to the red tag price of $7.00. Not much of a markdown, to be honest, but I love the value for the size. This smells like it is nearing its expiration, like 3-day-old coffee cake when you wouldn’t eat it at room temp, but if you microwave it, it’s all right. The scent was love at first sniff on all three of these, and thankfully the scent lingers instead of disappearing instantly. It was hidden among the many brown bottles of vanilla / almond oil / coconut / sandalwood options. Just when you think it all smells the same (and weak), something like this will surprise you.

Hi, I’m Sebastiaan, 35, from Wassenaar, Netherlands. Thought I’d try something different this year—because let’s be honest, February 14th is much more fun when you’ve got someone special to share it with.

So, who am I?
I’m a down-to-earth, loyal guy with a structured mind and a soft heart. I work in the legal and tech sector—partly serious business, partly solving IT mysteries—but when I’m off the clock, I like to unwind in worlds like The Witcher and Warhammer. Fantasy, strategy, a bit of nerdiness—I embrace it all. Life’s better when you have passions, right?

But don’t worry, I’m not just about video games and work. I also enjoy good conversations, quiet evenings, long walks, and spontaneous outings—whether it’s a new restaurant, a trip to the coast, or simply exploring a hidden corner of town. I appreciate the little things in life: a perfect cup of coffee, a shared laugh over a terrible movie, or those late-night talks that make you feel like you’ve known someone forever.

Looks-wise?
Think dark blond hair with a rebellious streak, a well-kept beard that’s here to stay, and blue-grey eyes that have seen their share of both rain and sunshine—much like our Dutch skies. You’ll often catch me in dark, practical clothing (comfort is key), though I clean up nicely when the occasion calls for it. And yes, I’m the guy who will open every stubborn jar in your kitchen—consider it a life skill.

What am I looking for?
I’d love to meet someone who’s kind, confident, and has her own life, but who also values building something together. Someone who’s not afraid to laugh when things go wrong, talk openly, and enjoy both the big adventures and the quiet moments. Whether it’s Netflix marathons, random road trips, or deep conversations over wine, I’m all in—especially if there’s room for humor and a bit of teasing along the way.

Honesty, warmth, and a playful spirit—that’s what I’m drawn to. I believe relationships thrive on respect, laughter, and being there for each other, even when life throws curveballs.

So, if you’re in the Netherlands and you’re thinking, “Hey, this sounds like someone I could vibe with,” let’s chat. Maybe we’ll turn this Single Awareness Day into the start of something pretty great.

Worst case? We have a good conversation and maybe a coffee.
Best case? Well... let’s just say next year, we might be planning our first Valentine’s together.

The Hoi A Lantern Market in Vietnam is a magical sight, especially at night. It’s located in the heart of Hoi An’s Ancient Town, near the Thu Bon River. The market is famous for its colorful silk lanterns, which illuminate the streets and create a dreamy atmosphere.

What to Expect:
 • Lanterns Everywhere: The market is lined with stalls selling handmade silk lanterns in various shapes, sizes, and colors. You can buy one as a souvenir or even join a lantern-making workshop.
 • Street Food & Shopping: Besides lanterns, the market offers local Vietnamese street food, handicrafts, and souvenirs. Must-try dishes include banh mi, Cao Lau noodles, and Vietnamese coffee.
 • Lantern Releasing on the River: Many visitors participate in the tradition of releasing small paper lanterns with candles onto the river, making a wish as they float away.

Best Time to Visit:
 • The market comes alive after sunset, usually from 5:00 PM to 10:00 PM.
 • The Hoi An Lantern Festival happens on the 14th day of every lunar month, when the entire town turns off electric lights and glows only with lanterns. It’s an unforgettable experience!",1,1739468671.0,TheTravelReel,0,1.0,False
1iooshr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/1iooshr/my_deep_thoughts/,My Deep Thoughts,"I’m just a guy who likes to think. A lot. Not in a way that makes me any wiser or smarter than anyone else---just in a way that makes me, well, me. My mind constantly wanders and drifts toward the big questions that have puzzled humanity since the dawn of consciousness: What is the nature of reality? What does it mean to be truly alive? What is this mysterious thing we call flow, and how do we find it in our daily lives? I don’t claim to have the answers, but I find deep joy in exploring these eternal mysteries.

I’ve found that the more I sit with these thoughts, the more I realize how little control we actually have over the grand tapestry of existence---and how incredibly freeing that realization can be. Life is perpetual movement, constant change, endless transformation. It’s like a river that keeps flowing, whether we choose to fight against its current or learn to swim harmoniously with it.

So, this is me, thinking out loud, letting the thoughts take shape as they naturally emerge from the depths of consciousness. I’m not seeking grand conclusions or absolute certainty---just embracing curiosity, cultivating presence, and maintaining a willingness to see where the mysterious flow of existence leads.

Universe… one turning, one change. That’s what it means, doesn’t it? This has been occupying my thoughts lately with increasing frequency. The way everything is just… flowing. Moving. Transforming. Even as I sit here trying to pin down these thoughts, countless cells in my body are dying and being reborn in an endless dance of renewal. Nothing in this vast cosmos stays still for even a moment.

I’ve been deeply immersing myself in this subject lately – fascinated by how the word “universe” comes from Latin, uni- meaning “one” and versus meaning “turned” or “changed.” One single turning. One eternal moment of transformation. It’s like… everything we perceive is just this one continuous change, and we’re all inseparable parts of this grand cosmic dance.

The Earth spinning at what, 67,000 miles per hour through the vastness of space? And here I am sometimes feeling so static, so trapped in my thoughts and behavioral patterns. But I’m not stuck at all, am I? I’m literally hurtling through the cosmos on this celestial rock, with blood rushing through my veins, lungs expanding and contracting in perfect rhythm without any effort on my part.

Why do we humans fight so desperately against this fundamental nature of reality though? The inevitability of change, I mean. We grip onto things, relationships, and ideas as if they were solid, permanent fixtures in our lives. But they’re not. Nothing truly is. Even this precise moment, right now, as I’m carefully crafting these thoughts – it’s already slipped into the past. New moment. New me. New everything. The ancient Taoists had profound insight into this truth, I think. That whole concept of wu wei – effortless action through non-action. Not forcing, not controlling, just… flowing naturally. Being authentic. Like water finding its elegant path around any obstacle it encounters.

I’ve been consciously trying to practice this perspective lately in my daily life. Just… observing with full attention. Watching how everything moves in its own perfect rhythm. The wind dancing through the trees. The clouds constantly shifting and reforming overhead. The way my emotions rise and fall like waves on an infinite ocean. It’s all part of this massive, endless cosmic dance, isn’t it? And I’m not outside of it, not some detached observer. I AM it.

That realization is simultaneously terrifying and breathtakingly beautiful. I am the change itself. Not separate from it. Not controlling it. Just… being it in each moment. My breath serves as a constant reminder of this truth. Each breath uniquely different from the last. Never exactly the same twice. A persistent reminder that change isn’t something that happens TO us – it’s what we ARE at our core.
You know what’s been particularly helpful in understanding this? These simple mindfulness practices I’ve been experimenting with lately. Like in the morning, instead of rigidly forcing myself to stick to some predetermined routine, I try to sensitively feel what feels right in each moment. What the natural flow is calling for. It’s often subtle, not some dramatic shift in behavior, but rather small mindful adjustments. Following the natural rhythm of life instead of constantly fighting against it.

The mental aspects are definitely the most challenging though. These persistent thoughts that spin and spiral endlessly, creating their own little universe of worry and endless what if scenarios. But even they’re not solid or permanent. They come and go like weather patterns across the sky of consciousness. Dark clouds, sunny skies, storms, peaceful calm… all passing through the same vast space of pure awareness. I’m gradually learning to watch them without getting hopelessly caught up in their drama.

Sometimes I find myself questioning whether I’m going a bit crazy thinking about all this metaphysical stuff. Like, who really spends their time contemplating the profound nature of change and the vast mysteries of the universe? But then again, maybe that’s exactly what we as conscious beings should be thinking about. Maybe all our seemingly important daily dramas and concerns are just… tiny ripples on the surface of something infinitely deeper and more meaningful than we typically realize.

I’ve been diving deeper into this fascinating world of mindfulness and present-moment awareness too. It’s truly remarkable how much of life’s rich tapestry we miss when we’re caught up in our endless stream of thoughts about the past or anxieties about the future. Like this one particularly memorable day, I was walking to the local store -- something I’ve done countless times before without much thought – but this time I made a conscious effort to be fully present in the experience. The way the golden sunlight filtered through the vibrant leaves, creating these intricate dancing shadows on the concrete sidewalk below. The melodious symphony of birds I usually completely tune out in my mental busyness. Even the subtle sensation of my feet making contact with the ground with each mindful step. It was as if I was seeing the familiar world through entirely new eyes. 

Then there’s this profound concept of non-attachment that I’ve been wrestling with lately. Not in some cold, emotionally disconnected way that some might misinterpret it as, but in this deeply loving and accepting way of being. I can care intensely and passionately about things and people while also maintaining a understanding that everything in this universe is temporary, always in a state of flux and transformation. This perspective has actually enhanced my appreciation for life’s precious moments. When you truly internalize that nothing is permanent, you naturally cherish each experience more deeply in the present moment.

I’ve been actively experimenting with this intriguing idea of emotional alchemy as well. Instead of fighting against or trying to suppress negative emotions, seeing them as pure energy that can be consciously transformed through awareness. When anxiety bubbles up about an approaching deadline or an important meeting, instead of getting hopelessly tangled in the mental narrative around it, I try to simply observe it with gentle awareness. Feel it move through my body like a wave of energy. It’s really just energy in motion when you think about it. E-motion. Pure life force expressing itself through these temporary forms we call feelings.

And speaking of subtle energy – I’ve been developing a heightened sensitivity to how it flows through different spaces and situations in my daily life. Like how some environments just feel heavy and stagnant, as if the energy has become trapped and needs clearing, while others feel light, vibrant and alive with possibility. Or how certain individuals seem to have this remarkable ability to shift the energetic frequency of an entire room just by walking into it. We’re all these complex fields of living energy, constantly influencing and being influenced by everything and everyone around us in this intricate dance of interconnection.

The body knows all this stuff naturally and instinctively. It’s the analytical mind that so often forgets these basic truths. The body exists in a constant state of flow, always adapting, always responding with intelligence to what each moment presents. It’s only our thoughts and concepts that create this persistent illusion of solidity, of permanence, of separation from the whole. I’ve been practicing awareness of this in small everyday activities. Like when I’m walking, consciously feeling how each step naturally flows into the next in perfect harmony. Or when I’m preparing food, noticing with fascination how ingredients transform and combine to become something entirely new and hopefully delicious.

I’ve been contemplating the nature of resistance a lot lately, examining how much precious life energy we waste fighting against what simply is. Like this one morning – I found myself stuck in traffic, and I could feel that all-too-familiar tension rising in my body like a tidal wave. But then, in a moment of clarity, I remembered: this too is simply part of life’s eternal flow. Instead of resisting this reality, I made a conscious choice to sink deeply into the present moment. Used this unexpected pause to truly listen to the music playing through my speakers, to observe with fascination the intricate play of morning light on the cars ahead, to notice my own breath moving in and out. It’s truly remarkable how differently the exact same external situation feels when you stop exhausting yourself by fighting against reality.

The really mind-bending aspect of all this is contemplating the mysterious nature of time itself. We typically talk about past, present, and future as if they’re these fixed, separate, and objective realities. But are they really? Time is often spoken of as if the past, present, and future are distinct and concrete. But in reality, only the present moment truly exists. The past is nothing more than memory—fragments stored in your mind, recalled only in the now. The future is merely imagination—possibilities and projections that exist only as thoughts in this moment. Everything you have ever experienced, everything you ever will, happens only in the now. Time, then, may not be a fixed reality but rather a construct of the mind, a way we try to make sense of the ever-flowing present. Einstein revolutionized our understanding by showing that time itself is relative, right? And when you really sink into this state of flow, this dimension we call time seems to… shift and bend in fascinating ways. Sometimes an hour can feel like a mere breath, sometimes a single minute feels like an eternity. Perhaps time itself is just another aspect of this grand cosmic dance of perpetual change and transformation.

You know what continues to amaze me? The more fully I embrace this natural flow of life, the more I notice how things just… work themselves out in often unexpected ways. Not always according to my limited personal preferences or expectations, but they invariably work out in ways that serve growth and evolution. It’s as if the universe itself possesses its own intelligence, its own organic way of unfolding. When I stubbornly try to force reality into conforming with my limited vision and understanding, I create suffering for myself. But when I trust in this universe… that’s when life reveals its magic in surprising ways.

I’ve been actively experimenting with applying this understanding to my relationships as well. It's fascinating to observe how differently these connections feel when you release the need to control everything, when you allow people the freedom to be who they authentically are instead of who you think they should be according to your preferences and projections. It’s like… the more I let go of rigid expectations and demands, the more genuine and vibrant these relationships naturally become.

There’s something particularly fascinating about the creative process too – how inspiration flows with effortless grace when you manage to get your analytical mind out of the way. I was carving a stone one day, and for quite a while, I was stuck in my head about it, trying too hard to make it “good” according to some imagined standard. But then something magical shifted in my awareness, and suddenly it wasn’t “me” doing the carving anymore in any conventional sense. It was as if the stone itself was gradually revealing its form through my hands. I completely lost track of time in that state of pure flow. Came back to normal awareness hours later with dust covering my hands and this profound sense of having been part of something far greater than my individual self.

Through direct experience, I’m learning that true surrender isn’t passive or weak at all as some might think. It’s actually this moment-by-moment conscious choice to step courageously into the unknown and trust that the universe has a greater wisdom than our limited minds can comprehend. It’s about releasing our desperate need for control and opening ourselves fully to what is, rather than remaining caught in our ideas about what we think should be. Much easier to talk about than to actually live, though, isn’t it?

Sometimes, in moments of quiet contemplation, I find myself imagining my existence as an inseparable part of this vast, endless cosmic dance. Countless stars being born and dying in spectacular supernovas, entire galaxies spinning in their celestial ballet, planets tracing their eternal orbits through the void, and here I am – a brief but conscious flicker of awareness in this infinite flow of existence. But even in my brevity, I’m fundamentally connected to the whole. Even in my apparent smallness, I’m woven into the fabric of all that is. My very atoms were forged in the hearts of ancient stars, and they will one day become part of something entirely new.

The ancient wisdom traditions understood these profound truths at a deep level. That’s precisely why they chose to call it uni-verse. One turning. One change. One eternal moment of perpetual transformation. In our modern reality we’re not really discovering anything new – we’re simply realizing what the ancients knew, what our bodies have always known at a cellular level, what the very nature of reality has been ceaselessly trying to communicate to us since the beginning of time.

My understanding of death has been transforming lately too. Instead of seeing it as this final, terrible ending to be feared and avoided, I’m beginning to recognize it as an integral part of the natural flow of existence. Everything in the natural world moves through these endless cycles of birth, death, and rebirth. The seasons, the cycles of the moon, the rising and setting of the sun – why should human consciousness be any different? Perhaps what we typically call death is simply another form of transformation, another turning in this infinite cosmic dance that never truly begins or ends.

There’s something profoundly liberating about embracing this deeper understanding of reality. I don’t have to carry the impossible burden of having everything figured out. I don’t need to know with certainty where all of this is ultimately going. My role isn’t to somehow direct or control the river of life – it’s to learn to swim with it gracefully, to trust its ancient wisdom, to allow it to carry me exactly where I need to go for my highest evolution.

And the synchronicities – they seem to multiply once you start paying attention with awareness. Those remarkable moments of perfect timing, those seemingly random “coincidences” that feel more like gentle whispers from the universe itself. Like yesterday’s experience, when exactly the book I needed somehow found its way into my hands at precisely the right moment. These aren’t mere chance occurrences but rather confirmations of our deeper connection to the whole.

I’ve been practicing this approach where instead of forcefully trying to implement changes in my life according to some mental plan, I attempt to align myself more naturally with the changes that are already wanting to happen through me. It’s similar to… you know that experience when you’re swimming in the ocean, and you can either exhaust yourself fighting against the powerful waves or learn to move in harmony with them? When you resist and fight, you quickly become depleted. But when you learn to move with their natural rhythm, there’s this… effortless grace that emerges naturally.


I’ve been consciously applying this understanding to my work as well. Instead of forcing myself to push through periods of natural resistance, I’m learning to notice and honor the times when I’m naturally energized and aligned with the flow of creativity and productivity. When I work with these natural rhythms rather than against them, I find that not only does the quality of my work improve dramatically, but the entire experience becomes more enjoyable and fulfilling. Sometimes this means working intensely during periods of natural inspiration, while other times it means allowing myself to rest and recharge when my energy naturally ebbs.

Perhaps this is what all the great spiritual teachers throughout history have been trying to help us understand. That we’re not actually separate from this vast flow of existence as we so often believe. We’re not isolated islands standing alone in the middle of a flowing river of life. We ARE the river itself in human form. The flow isn’t some external force we need to somehow tap into or connect with – it’s what we fundamentally are at our deepest level of being. Our very essence is this flow, this dance, this eternal movement of life expressing itself through temporary forms.

I’m gradually learning to say yes to all of it, to embrace the totality of human experience. The moments of transcendent joy and the periods of deep pain. The times of effortless ease and the challenges that stretch us beyond our comfort zones. The beautiful blossoming of growth and the necessary decay that makes new life possible. Because it's all one seamless movement, isn’t it? One vast, beautiful, terrible, magnificent flow of being expressing itself in infinite ways. And I’m not separate from any of it. I never was. I never could be. This understanding brings both profound responsibility and incredible freedom.

Sometimes the most profound and transformative truths are also the simplest and most obvious once we have eyes to see them. Like this morning, I was simply sitting with my steaming cup of coffee, watching with fascination as the delicate wisps of steam rose and spiraled in the crisp morning air. And suddenly it hit me with the force of revelation – that’s me too. That’s all of us. Rising, spiraling, dissolving, becoming something new in each moment. Over and over and over again in this eternal dance of transformation. The steam wasn’t just showing me its nature, but revealing my own nature to me in that moment of clarity.

Maybe that’s the greatest gift of this deepening understanding – this profound sense of belonging to something far greater than ourselves. Of being an integral part of something so vast and incomprehensibly beautiful that my limited human mind can’t fully grasp or contain it. But the beautiful truth is that I don’t need to intellectually comprehend it all. I just need to flow with it, trust it, allow it to move through me and as me in each moment. My role is to be a conscious participant in this grand dance of existence.

And so here I sit, allowing these thoughts to flow through my awareness like water moving through a stream bed. Each moment entirely unique and different from the last. Each breath marking a new beginning in this eternal now. Each heartbeat serving as a reminder that I am alive, I am changing, I am the change itself expressing through this particular form. The universe isn’t something out there, separate from who and what I am. It’s what I am in my deepest essence. What we all are at our core. One vast, eternal moment of transformation, expressing itself in infinite ways through all forms and phenomena.

One verse. One change. One eternal dance of being. And I am dancing it, whether I remember this truth in each moment or not. We all are, every single one of us. Maybe that’s enough. Maybe that’s absolutely everything. Maybe in that simple understanding lies the key to living with both grace and purpose in this magnificent mystery we call life.

Hi, I’m Sebastiaan, 35, from Wassenaar, Netherlands. Thought I’d try something different this year—because let’s be honest, February 14th is much more fun when you’ve got someone special to share it with.

So, who am I?
I’m a down-to-earth, loyal guy with a structured mind and a soft heart. I work in the legal and tech sector—partly serious business, partly solving IT mysteries—but when I’m off the clock, I like to unwind in worlds like The Witcher and Warhammer. Fantasy, strategy, a bit of nerdiness—I embrace it all. Life’s better when you have passions, right?

But don’t worry, I’m not just about video games and work. I also enjoy good conversations, quiet evenings, long walks, and spontaneous outings—whether it’s a new restaurant, a trip to the coast, or simply exploring a hidden corner of town. I appreciate the little things in life: a perfect cup of coffee, a shared laugh over a terrible movie, or those late-night talks that make you feel like you’ve known someone forever.

Looks-wise?
Think dark blond hair with a rebellious streak, a well-kept beard that’s here to stay, and blue-grey eyes that have seen their share of both rain and sunshine—much like our Dutch skies. You’ll often catch me in dark, practical clothing (comfort is key), though I clean up nicely when the occasion calls for it. And yes, I’m the guy who will open every stubborn jar in your kitchen—consider it a life skill.

What am I looking for?
I’d love to meet someone who’s kind, confident, and has her own life, but who also values building something together. Someone who’s not afraid to laugh when things go wrong, talk openly, and enjoy both the big adventures and the quiet moments. Whether it’s Netflix marathons, random road trips, or deep conversations over wine, I’m all in—especially if there’s room for humor and a bit of teasing along the way.

Honesty, warmth, and a playful spirit—that’s what I’m drawn to. I believe relationships thrive on respect, laughter, and being there for each other, even when life throws curveballs.

So, if you’re in the Netherlands and you’re thinking, “Hey, this sounds like someone I could vibe with,” let’s chat. Maybe we’ll turn this Single Awareness Day into the start of something pretty great.

Worst case? We have a good conversation and maybe a coffee.
Best case? Well... let’s just say next year, we might be planning our first Valentine’s together.

I had experienced on and off attacks with increased in frequency since 2019. I finally had ultrasounds done in September 2024 after seeing my nurse practitioner. I saw a GI specialist a month later and a surgeon two months after that. My surgery was a scheduled for February. 

My husband and I arrived at 7am at the hospital and I registered and got the patient outfit on. Did some blood work and got into a pre op bed and watched some tv until it was my turn. Right on schedule I was being walked into the operating room and saying goodbye to my husband.

The room was freezing and they had me lie down and put a very warm blanket on me. The anesthesiologist told me my IV would burn a bit when he was putting the medicine in and I’d taste a metallic taste in my mouth and to just keep deep breathing the oxygen. He said I would fall asleep soon and then I woke up in the post op room a little bit sore. 

I felt nauseous and they put an alcohol wipe across my nose and then I felt ok. I was a little groggy and found it hard to stay awake, but I did. One I sat there for a little while they rolled me out and into the after care room. I almost got a little emotional asking if I could see my husband. He came up in no time and then I had two little apple juices and some cookies and jello. My husband helped me get dressed then I got up and walked to the bathroom. I came out and sat in a wheel chair and we were good to leave. I was at the hospital from 7am-1pm. 

I had a pillow ready to put on my stomach for the car ride home. We drove to a Krispy Kreme and bought donuts for our babysitter. I got out of the car and did the walk from the parking lot around the corner from the shop. I got home and had a big cup of black tea and then a plain donut. Had some jam toast a little later and jello to follow. I’ve had lots of water and my pain meds we got from the hospital. 

Now on day two I started my morning with coffee, peanut butter toast, half an apple, scrambled eggs, a bunch of water and I’ve already had my first poop. Took awhile but not painful or a mess. 

I’m not in a huge amount of pain, I’ve been getting up and walking around and then resting. My first night sleeping I did partially on my back propped up and then I rolled a little in my sleep. I’ve done a ton of burping and passing gas. Every time I was uncomfortable I would get out of bed and burp a bunch. So far I’m doing pretty good and haven’t had a horrible time of it.

I (M64) recently met a woman (F64) through an online dating app. We communicated fairly regularly and in fairly long messages, at first through the app and then through regular texting. For a variety of reasons, it was a couple of weeks before we were able to meet in person. In the time before that first date, she was out of town for a family event and then she had to catch up at work, so we didn't communicate for about two weeks. I assumed the lack of contact from her indicated a loss of interest.

Then she contacted me to set up a date to meet. It was going to just be coffee at first, based on her preference, but she later suggested lunch. We met and had a great date, and she suggested I join her and her friends to go to a concert a few days later.

The concert went well, and we made plans to meet for dinner a few days later, for a total of three dates within one week.

During that dinner, we both shared some fairly intimate things. Admittedly, what I shared was pretty heavy compared to what she told me. I confessed, in a sort of jovial way, that I had this urge to kiss her after the concert, but we reaffirmed that we're taking things slowly. At the end of the date, she kissed me on the cheek.

I suggested we get together for Valentine's Day (we both know it's not yet a relationship, so it would have been a casual thing - not overly romantic) but she said she'd have to work late to catch up on the work she missed. We were talking about maybe going out the Sunday after Valentine's Day, but by the time I contacted her a couple of days later, she'd already made plans to spend time with friends, including one that was visiting from out of town. I knew she was having a visitor from out of town, but she initially said that wouldn't interfere.

Since she works hard, I don't hear from her often (not as often as before we met), and I don't text her often since I don't want to come across as needy.

Hi, I’m Sebastiaan, 35, from Wassenaar, Netherlands. Thought I’d try something different this year—because let’s be honest, February 14th is much more fun when you’ve got someone special to share it with.

So, who am I?
I’m a down-to-earth, loyal guy with a structured mind and a soft heart. I work in the legal and tech sector—partly serious business, partly solving IT mysteries—but when I’m off the clock, I like to unwind in worlds like The Witcher and Warhammer. Fantasy, strategy, a bit of nerdiness—I embrace it all. Life’s better when you have passions, right?

But don’t worry, I’m not just about video games and work. I also enjoy good conversations, quiet evenings, long walks, and spontaneous outings—whether it’s a new restaurant, a trip to the coast, or simply exploring a hidden corner of town. I appreciate the little things in life: a perfect cup of coffee, a shared laugh over a terrible movie, or those late-night talks that make you feel like you’ve known someone forever.

Looks-wise?
Think dark blond hair with a rebellious streak, a well-kept beard that’s here to stay, and blue-grey eyes that have seen their share of both rain and sunshine—much like our Dutch skies. You’ll often catch me in dark, practical clothing (comfort is key), though I clean up nicely when the occasion calls for it. And yes, I’m the guy who will open every stubborn jar in your kitchen—consider it a life skill.

What am I looking for?
I’d love to meet someone who’s kind, confident, and has her own life, but who also values building something together. Someone who’s not afraid to laugh when things go wrong, talk openly, and enjoy both the big adventures and the quiet moments. Whether it’s Netflix marathons, random road trips, or deep conversations over wine, I’m all in—especially if there’s room for humor and a bit of teasing along the way.

Honesty, warmth, and a playful spirit—that’s what I’m drawn to. I believe relationships thrive on respect, laughter, and being there for each other, even when life throws curveballs.

So, if you’re in the Netherlands and you’re thinking, “Hey, this sounds like someone I could vibe with,” let’s chat. Maybe we’ll turn this Single Awareness Day into the start of something pretty great.

Worst case? We have a good conversation and maybe a coffee.
Best case? Well... let’s just say next year, we might be planning our first Valentine’s together.

I’m 17 with a history of ED, which started from mild anorexia and ended in atypical bulimia. These past months, through my therapist, I’ve started eating ‘’‘normally’’’. Which means that instead of periods of starvation followed by periods of heavy binging, I’ve been eating normal quantities and only having binge episodes when under stress or other emotional responses. In short, I’ve gained weight and am currently sitting at 168lbs at 5’7. 

My current diet is unhealthy as is my relationship with food, and I’d like to lose weight (but couldn’t bare the stress of starting the process again by myself). So my therapist suggested a dietitian who’s supposedly trained in dealing with EDs and focuses on creating a healthy relationship with nutrition. So, I tried it out.

I left her office almost crying because I felt like she didn’t listen to me at all. Most of the time I was with her assistants. They had me answer an ED questionnaire-type thing, but didn’t bring it up again at all. They said my weight aloud even though I asked them not to. I had stated from the start that losing weight wasn’t my main priority yet they treated it as if it was. The program they gave me is completely different to my usual diet with none of the things I currently eat and extremely small quantities with specific meal times. There’s literally not a single thing I’m excited about on that catalog and it’s the exact same as I could find on any site without having to pay 50€. She expects me to weigh/measure out EVERYTHING and eat it bland/with barely any sauce, weigh myself twice a week, cut all sugar/junk food cold turkey, not drink any soda/coffee/anything with sugar, has specific fruit quantities, says to only drink plant or less than 2% milk, pry all meat for any fat/skin, only have salad as a side dish…

I’m just freaking out so much because this is NOT what I was hoping for. None of the issues I came in for were addressed. This plan just seems like it’ll send me right back into relapsing. She refused to give me the general caloric budget so I could have some sense of freedom over what I ate and told me to just message her if I wanted to change something.

Am I overreacting? I feel silly for being so worked up over this but it was not at all what I expected.",8,1739468396.0,loseit,13,0.83,False

If you’re Gen Z—or even if you’re not—you’ve probably noticed something profoundly unsettling: we’re fast losing the right to own anything. Everything we once bought is now merely a service. Remember the days when purchasing a book meant it was yours forever? Now, it seems your Kindle library might vanish overnight. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

From printers that won’t work unless you subscribe to a monthly fee to cars that are nothing more than moving subscription services, the age of ownership is dying. We’re hurtling toward a future where, by 2030, you might own nothing at all—and yet be told you’re “happy” with that arrangement. Welcome to the subscription era, where every product, every piece of media, and every tool is locked behind a reoccurring paywall.

[Black Mirror knew all along that we are screwed...](https://preview.redd.it/9cgnpszcwxie1.png?width=1324&format=png&auto=webp&s=f673a0ad8762e6ea340ade0d5d2e285c874f2568)

# The Rise of the Subscription Economy

Over the past decade, a new business model has taken over nearly every industry—from media to transportation to household appliances. What once was a one-time purchase is now an endless subscription. This isn’t just a minor inconvenience; it’s a fundamental shift in how we interact with the things we use every day.

# The New Normal: Everything as a Service

The modern economy now champions a mantra: “You don’t own anything.” Instead of buying a car outright, you might pay a monthly fee for access. Instead of owning music or movies, you stream them for a subscription fee. The idea—originally pitched as liberating consumers from the burdens of maintenance and high upfront costs—has rapidly morphed into a dystopian reality.

https://preview.redd.it/93wvnpcvvxie1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=c17a371160289957e0326ea68805ab9810a9a38c

Consider these examples:

* **Ebooks and Digital Media:** Once, when you bought a book on your Kindle, it was yours to keep. Now, your digital library is at the mercy of corporate policies that can revoke access at any moment.
* **Printers and Office Equipment:** Imagine buying a printer only to find that you’re forced into a subscription to print more than a certain number of pages. Your device isn’t really yours—it’s just a gateway to a service you’re forced to pay for continuously.
* **Automobiles:** Automakers are eyeing a future where the car you drive isn’t an asset but a subscription service that you rent on a daily or monthly basis.
* **Streaming and Software:** From music to movies, from productivity tools to design software, subscription models are everywhere. You might have 900 streaming services available, each with a monthly fee, and if you cancel one, you risk losing access to media you once thought you’d purchased.

It’s not just inconvenience; it’s a loss of control. As the rights to our digital and physical products become licenses instead of property, we’re slowly ceding control to corporations.

# Gen Z: Born into a World of “Renting” Everything

Gen Z was raised in a world where access mattered more than ownership. Yet, as they enter adulthood, they’re paying the price for a system that was never designed for them. The promise of “own nothing and be happy” may have sounded like a utopian dream once—but for many young people, it’s quickly turning dystopian.

# The High Cost of Subscription Overload

Let’s talk numbers. In today’s economy, the average American reportedly holds about 4.5 subscriptions. That might not sound like a lot, but consider this: those subscriptions can add up to nearly $924 per year. And if these fees keep creeping up, you might be shelling out thousands of dollars a year for services you never truly own.

https://preview.redd.it/z2h6wldlwxie1.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=800de741355337f5629d4877297d0f7d1e185f33

Below is a table that captures some key statistics on subscription spending:

|**Metric**|**Value**|**Significance**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Average Number of Subscriptions|4.5 per person|Reflects widespread adoption of the subscription model|
|Average Annual Spending|\~$924 per person|Cumulative cost of recurring subscriptions|
|Projected Annual Increase|Potentially rising into the $1,000s|Subscription fees are not fixed and tend to increase|

These figures illustrate how our monthly “rent” for everything—from music and movies to software and even basic utilities—is draining our wallets, leaving little room for actual savings or the acquisition of tangible assets.

# Debt, BNPL, and the Erosion of Financial Freedom

Beyond subscriptions, Gen Z is also burdened by debt. Compared to previous generations, they start adult life with a heavier load of credit card debt, car loans, and mortgages. One alarming trend is the rapid rise of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) platforms, which promise interest-free purchases but often trap users in cycles of debt.

Recent studies suggest that BNPL adoption among Gen Z is expected to increase from 36.8% in 2021 to 47.4% by 2025. The appeal is obvious: instant gratification without immediate financial pain. But the catch is that while BNPL offers 0% interest on paper, it creates an illusion of debt-free spending that can spiral out of control.

https://preview.redd.it/1x396asbvxie1.png?width=470&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd2b36c789b1aa00c9686115c6ca49ab77d72755

Consider the following table summarizing BNPL statistics among young consumers:

|**Metric**|**Statistic**|**Implication**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|BNPL Adoption Rate (Gen Z, 2021)|36.8%|Already a significant portion of young adults use BNPL|
|Expected BNPL Adoption Rate (2025)|47.4%|Rapid growth, indicating deeper reliance on debt-based models|
|Percentage Using BNPL for Non-Essentials|\~25%|Indicates misuse beyond essential purchases|
|Average Increase in Purchase Price|Significant (varies by sector)|BNPL users tend to spend more per purchase|

This table highlights the dangerous cycle: as more young people use BNPL services, they’re likely to incur additional debt, which in turn further limits their ability to save or invest in real assets.

# The End of Ownership: How Subscription Models Are Redefining Consumer Rights

Subscription models are not limited to media or BNPL; they’re infiltrating every aspect of our lives. Whether it’s smart fridges, connected cars, or even your daily cup of coffee, companies are finding ways to lock you into continuous payments while stripping away the notion of true ownership.

# Licensing Over Ownership: The New Reality

https://preview.redd.it/2y6uvbqexxie1.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=052ef59bf1706f67b4460a086b1204b5eeb26d66

At the heart of the issue is the concept of licensing versus ownership. When you purchase physical media—a DVD or a book—the exhaustion doctrine in copyright law ensures that you can do what you want with that item. You can lend it, resell it, or even gift it to a friend. However, when you “buy” digital media, you’re often just paying for a license to access that content. This license can be revoked or modified at the whim of the provider, leaving you with nothing if you ever break a rule or if the service changes its terms.

Here’s a table comparing physical ownership and digital licensing:

|**Aspect**|**Physical Ownership**|**Digital Licensing/Subscription**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**User Rights**|Full control: lend, resell, modify, or gift|Limited rights: access only as long as license is active|
|**Durability**|Permanent; asset remains with you|Ephemeral; content can be revoked or altered|
|**Cost Structure**|One-time purchase with potential for resale|Recurring fees; costs can increase over time|
|**Legal Protections**|Exhaustion doctrine protects buyer’s rights|Subject to terms of service; fewer consumer protections|

This comparison underscores the fundamental shift: as our world moves from tangible ownership to digital licensing, consumers lose not only control but also the ability to build long-term wealth through assets.

# The Subscription Trap: A Vicious Cycle

https://preview.redd.it/lyfnhkg2xxie1.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f93e6fb089a67d773f3942be573454c05e0f39c

What happens when everything you use is locked behind a paywall? The result is a perpetual cycle of payments with no end in sight. You pay monthly fees for music, movies, video games, fitness apps, and even for storage of your personal memories. Over time, these fees add up dramatically, draining resources that could otherwise be saved or invested.

Consider the average subscription expenditure:

* **Music Streaming:** \~$10.99/month
* **Movie Streaming:** \~$12.99/month
* **Video Games or Software:** \~$9.99/month
* **Miscellaneous Services (fitness, dating apps, etc.):** Varies widely

If you’re paying for several such services every month—and these fees tend to increase over time—the cumulative annual cost becomes staggering. For many, these recurring expenses are nothing short of extortion.

Below is a table summarizing average monthly subscription fees for various services:

|**Service Category**|**Average Monthly Fee**|**Annual Cost (Approx.)**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Music Streaming (e.g., Spotify)|$10.99|\~$132|
|Video Streaming (e.g., Netflix)|$12.99|\~$156|
|Video Games/Software (e.g., Xbox Game Pass)|$9.99|\~$120|
|Fitness/Dating/Other Apps|$9.99 – $15.99|\~$120 – $192|
|**Total (Average for 4–5 Services)**|—|**$528 – $690+ per year**|

For many young adults, this might seem manageable. But multiply that by the ever-growing number of subscriptions—and consider that many Gen Zers may be paying for rent, utilities, and student loans too—the overall financial burden becomes enormous.

# The Debt Crisis: Gen Z’s Financial Squeeze

https://preview.redd.it/z9fi63dsxxie1.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=a00c0b7409336c5364238dc16e18b200fa2240e7

Subscription models aren’t the only problem. Gen Z faces a debt crisis that dwarfs the challenges of previous generations. Credit card debt, car loans, and mortgages are weighing them down from the moment they step into adulthood.

One of the more insidious contributors to this debt crisis is the explosion of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services. BNPL platforms promise 0% interest and instant gratification, but they encourage overspending. The ease of access to credit makes it tempting for young consumers to purchase non-essential items, leading to a vicious cycle of debt accumulation.

https://preview.redd.it/x7jpyc6xxxie1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab97ee4cb97b5b23afe7f856d88849000f07fa07

Consider these statistics on BNPL usage among Gen Z:

|**Metric**|**Statistic**|**Implication**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|BNPL Adoption Rate (Gen Z, 2021)|36.8%|A significant portion of young adults are using BNPL|
|Expected BNPL Adoption Rate (2025)|47.4%|Rapid growth indicates increasing reliance on debt|
|Usage Frequency|80% of users employ BNPL at least every 6 months|Reinforces habitual debt behavior|

Couple these numbers with the rising costs of living—rents, utilities, and daily expenses—and the result is a generation that struggles to break free from perpetual indebtedness.

For instance, studies show that today’s young adults may spend on average around $226,000 on rent over their lifetime before ever owning a home. With skyrocketing housing costs and stagnant wages, the dream of homeownership is slipping further away.

https://preview.redd.it/5qkde5nszxie1.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=217a9325dd058814d3ffbb2cff3da459c703a4b6

Another table to highlight Gen Z’s debt burden:

|**Debt Category**|**Key Statistic**|**Impact on Financial Freedom**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Credit Card Debt|Average Gen Z debt: \~$55,000|Significantly higher than previous generations|
|Student Loans|Average debt: \~$2,000 – $?? (varies by country)|Increases financial stress and limits savings|
|Rent Expenditure|\~$226,000 lifetime spend before owning a home|Reduces capacity to invest in assets|
|BNPL Usage|47.4% adoption expected by 2025|Normalizes debt as part of everyday spending|

These figures make it clear: Gen Z is not just facing high subscription fees—they’re also saddled with a mounting debt load that undermines their ability to build long-term wealth.

https://preview.redd.it/1m9egiwgyxie1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e2ff4e743eb7ae47beb0f27a0455c67fea39e52

# The Dystopian Vision of 2030: Own Nothing, Be Happy?

https://preview.redd.it/ttflpjcmzxie1.png?width=1013&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f2d2ceab1d639d1d488908e936185967824023c

The phrase “own nothing, be happy” has become a sort of dystopian prophecy. Originally coined by a Danish Social Democrat in 2016 as a utopian vision of a future where sharing and service-based economies would liberate us from the burdens of ownership, that dream is rapidly turning into a nightmare.

As subscription models replace ownership, personal property is gradually eroded. Your car, your home, even your clothing—everything becomes a service that you rent instead of own. This model might offer convenience in the short term, but it also means you’re perpetually at the mercy of corporations who can change the rules at any time.

https://preview.redd.it/lj8gqbn4zxie1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cc8698eafbe9dcbac6396974ee04082d7395a77

Here’s a table summarizing the shift from ownership to subscription:

|**Item/Service**|**Traditional Ownership Model**|**Subscription/Service Model**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Books (e.g., Kindle)**|Once purchased, permanently owned|Access can be revoked; subject to licensing terms|
|**Vehicles**|Owned assets; can be modified/resold|Monthly subscription; no asset accumulation|
|**Software/Media**|One-time purchase with long-term rights|Recurring fees; digital licenses with restrictions|
|**Household Appliances**|Bought outright, with repair or resale rights|Subscription-based usage with frequent upgrades/fees|
|**Cloud Storage/Utilities**|Owned capacity or fixed payment systems|Dynamic subscription fees; subject to price hikes|

This table lays bare the fundamental transformation: as more aspects of our lives become subscription-based, we lose the very concept of ownership. And when you don’t own what you use, you have no long-term control over your life.

https://preview.redd.it/evqfu91hzxie1.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f1cc093979812444f17f5fb174d7fb502700f04

# The Imperative for Awareness and Reform

[2030 is right around the corner](https://preview.redd.it/rjarg5b50yie1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fdac701d8da5303ccecd78ea00d766390db5c6f)

This isn’t just about how much you pay each month—it’s about the future of our society. When everything you use is rented, when every purchase is a lease on a service rather than a step toward ownership, we lose something fundamental: our independence. Gen Z is the first generation to be born into this world of perpetual subscriptions, and the consequences are already visible in mounting debt, economic insecurity, and a loss of control over personal property.

The erosion of ownership is more than just an economic trend—it’s a shift in the very fabric of society. It’s time to ask tough questions: Is it really progress if you never own anything? How can we reclaim our rights as consumers and citizens in a system that prioritizes corporate profits over individual autonomy?

As we hurtle toward 2030, the vision of “own nothing and be happy” may sound utopian on paper, but for many, it’s a recipe for disempowerment. The current iteration of capitalism—driven by subscription models, BNPL platforms, and the relentless pursuit of profit—shows us that without intervention, the average person will spend their entire lives renting everything they need.",4,1739468288.0,Brokeonomics,0,1.0,False

I have put nicotine in my body in almost every possible way. Cigarettes, vapes, heat-not-burn, patches, gums etc. I was never addicted to the method of consuming nicotine, but to nicotine itself, i can't say that I used to smoke cigarettes more than vaping and more than using patches/gums. I had quit before between 3-12 months multiple times. Every quitting was awful. My brain is SOOOOO HAPPPY with nicotine. 

This time it's because of money, budget is really tight right now, and nicotine is expensive, no matter the form. If budget becomes better, I might start again.

This time it's harder than ever, probably because life has become a bit more boring as I am getting older (I ain't actually old, approaching 30's, but I have less friends, less going out, more boring work, u know what I m talking about).

1ioohsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1ioohsx/my_deep_thoughts/,My Deep Thoughts,"I’m just a guy who likes to think. A lot. Not in a way that makes me any wiser or smarter than anyone else---just in a way that makes me, well, me. My mind constantly wanders and drifts toward the big questions that have puzzled humanity since the dawn of consciousness: What is the nature of reality? What does it mean to be truly alive? What is this mysterious thing we call flow, and how do we find it in our daily lives? I don’t claim to have the answers, but I find deep joy in exploring these eternal mysteries.

I’ve found that the more I sit with these thoughts, the more I realize how little control we actually have over the grand tapestry of existence---and how incredibly freeing that realization can be. Life is perpetual movement, constant change, endless transformation. It’s like a river that keeps flowing, whether we choose to fight against its current or learn to swim harmoniously with it.

So, this is me, thinking out loud, letting the thoughts take shape as they naturally emerge from the depths of consciousness. I’m not seeking grand conclusions or absolute certainty---just embracing curiosity, cultivating presence, and maintaining a willingness to see where the mysterious flow of existence leads.

Universe… one turning, one change. That’s what it means, doesn’t it? This has been occupying my thoughts lately with increasing frequency. The way everything is just… flowing. Moving. Transforming. Even as I sit here trying to pin down these thoughts, countless cells in my body are dying and being reborn in an endless dance of renewal. Nothing in this vast cosmos stays still for even a moment.

I’ve been deeply immersing myself in this subject lately – fascinated by how the word “universe” comes from Latin, uni- meaning “one” and versus meaning “turned” or “changed.” One single turning. One eternal moment of transformation. It’s like… everything we perceive is just this one continuous change, and we’re all inseparable parts of this grand cosmic dance.

The Earth spinning at what, 67,000 miles per hour through the vastness of space? And here I am sometimes feeling so static, so trapped in my thoughts and behavioral patterns. But I’m not stuck at all, am I? I’m literally hurtling through the cosmos on this celestial rock, with blood rushing through my veins, lungs expanding and contracting in perfect rhythm without any effort on my part.

Why do we humans fight so desperately against this fundamental nature of reality though? The inevitability of change, I mean. We grip onto things, relationships, and ideas as if they were solid, permanent fixtures in our lives. But they’re not. Nothing truly is. Even this precise moment, right now, as I’m carefully crafting these thoughts – it’s already slipped into the past. New moment. New me. New everything. The ancient Taoists had profound insight into this truth, I think. That whole concept of wu wei – effortless action through non-action. Not forcing, not controlling, just… flowing naturally. Being authentic. Like water finding its elegant path around any obstacle it encounters.

I’ve been consciously trying to practice this perspective lately in my daily life. Just… observing with full attention. Watching how everything moves in its own perfect rhythm. The wind dancing through the trees. The clouds constantly shifting and reforming overhead. The way my emotions rise and fall like waves on an infinite ocean. It’s all part of this massive, endless cosmic dance, isn’t it? And I’m not outside of it, not some detached observer. I AM it.

That realization is simultaneously terrifying and breathtakingly beautiful. I am the change itself. Not separate from it. Not controlling it. Just… being it in each moment. My breath serves as a constant reminder of this truth. Each breath uniquely different from the last. Never exactly the same twice. A persistent reminder that change isn’t something that happens TO us – it’s what we ARE at our core.
You know what’s been particularly helpful in understanding this? These simple mindfulness practices I’ve been experimenting with lately. Like in the morning, instead of rigidly forcing myself to stick to some predetermined routine, I try to sensitively feel what feels right in each moment. What the natural flow is calling for. It’s often subtle, not some dramatic shift in behavior, but rather small mindful adjustments. Following the natural rhythm of life instead of constantly fighting against it.

The mental aspects are definitely the most challenging though. These persistent thoughts that spin and spiral endlessly, creating their own little universe of worry and endless what if scenarios. But even they’re not solid or permanent. They come and go like weather patterns across the sky of consciousness. Dark clouds, sunny skies, storms, peaceful calm… all passing through the same vast space of pure awareness. I’m gradually learning to watch them without getting hopelessly caught up in their drama.

Sometimes I find myself questioning whether I’m going a bit crazy thinking about all this metaphysical stuff. Like, who really spends their time contemplating the profound nature of change and the vast mysteries of the universe? But then again, maybe that’s exactly what we as conscious beings should be thinking about. Maybe all our seemingly important daily dramas and concerns are just… tiny ripples on the surface of something infinitely deeper and more meaningful than we typically realize.

I’ve been diving deeper into this fascinating world of mindfulness and present-moment awareness too. It’s truly remarkable how much of life’s rich tapestry we miss when we’re caught up in our endless stream of thoughts about the past or anxieties about the future. Like this one particularly memorable day, I was walking to the local store -- something I’ve done countless times before without much thought – but this time I made a conscious effort to be fully present in the experience. The way the golden sunlight filtered through the vibrant leaves, creating these intricate dancing shadows on the concrete sidewalk below. The melodious symphony of birds I usually completely tune out in my mental busyness. Even the subtle sensation of my feet making contact with the ground with each mindful step. It was as if I was seeing the familiar world through entirely new eyes. 

Then there’s this profound concept of non-attachment that I’ve been wrestling with lately. Not in some cold, emotionally disconnected way that some might misinterpret it as, but in this deeply loving and accepting way of being. I can care intensely and passionately about things and people while also maintaining a understanding that everything in this universe is temporary, always in a state of flux and transformation. This perspective has actually enhanced my appreciation for life’s precious moments. When you truly internalize that nothing is permanent, you naturally cherish each experience more deeply in the present moment.

I’ve been actively experimenting with this intriguing idea of emotional alchemy as well. Instead of fighting against or trying to suppress negative emotions, seeing them as pure energy that can be consciously transformed through awareness. When anxiety bubbles up about an approaching deadline or an important meeting, instead of getting hopelessly tangled in the mental narrative around it, I try to simply observe it with gentle awareness. Feel it move through my body like a wave of energy. It’s really just energy in motion when you think about it. E-motion. Pure life force expressing itself through these temporary forms we call feelings.

And speaking of subtle energy – I’ve been developing a heightened sensitivity to how it flows through different spaces and situations in my daily life. Like how some environments just feel heavy and stagnant, as if the energy has become trapped and needs clearing, while others feel light, vibrant and alive with possibility. Or how certain individuals seem to have this remarkable ability to shift the energetic frequency of an entire room just by walking into it. We’re all these complex fields of living energy, constantly influencing and being influenced by everything and everyone around us in this intricate dance of interconnection.

The body knows all this stuff naturally and instinctively. It’s the analytical mind that so often forgets these basic truths. The body exists in a constant state of flow, always adapting, always responding with intelligence to what each moment presents. It’s only our thoughts and concepts that create this persistent illusion of solidity, of permanence, of separation from the whole. I’ve been practicing awareness of this in small everyday activities. Like when I’m walking, consciously feeling how each step naturally flows into the next in perfect harmony. Or when I’m preparing food, noticing with fascination how ingredients transform and combine to become something entirely new and hopefully delicious.

I’ve been contemplating the nature of resistance a lot lately, examining how much precious life energy we waste fighting against what simply is. Like this one morning – I found myself stuck in traffic, and I could feel that all-too-familiar tension rising in my body like a tidal wave. But then, in a moment of clarity, I remembered: this too is simply part of life’s eternal flow. Instead of resisting this reality, I made a conscious choice to sink deeply into the present moment. Used this unexpected pause to truly listen to the music playing through my speakers, to observe with fascination the intricate play of morning light on the cars ahead, to notice my own breath moving in and out. It’s truly remarkable how differently the exact same external situation feels when you stop exhausting yourself by fighting against reality.

The really mind-bending aspect of all this is contemplating the mysterious nature of time itself. We typically talk about past, present, and future as if they’re these fixed, separate, and objective realities. But are they really? Time is often spoken of as if the past, present, and future are distinct and concrete. But in reality, only the present moment truly exists. The past is nothing more than memory—fragments stored in your mind, recalled only in the now. The future is merely imagination—possibilities and projections that exist only as thoughts in this moment. Everything you have ever experienced, everything you ever will, happens only in the now. Time, then, may not be a fixed reality but rather a construct of the mind, a way we try to make sense of the ever-flowing present. Einstein revolutionized our understanding by showing that time itself is relative, right? And when you really sink into this state of flow, this dimension we call time seems to… shift and bend in fascinating ways. Sometimes an hour can feel like a mere breath, sometimes a single minute feels like an eternity. Perhaps time itself is just another aspect of this grand cosmic dance of perpetual change and transformation.

You know what continues to amaze me? The more fully I embrace this natural flow of life, the more I notice how things just… work themselves out in often unexpected ways. Not always according to my limited personal preferences or expectations, but they invariably work out in ways that serve growth and evolution. It’s as if the universe itself possesses its own intelligence, its own organic way of unfolding. When I stubbornly try to force reality into conforming with my limited vision and understanding, I create suffering for myself. But when I trust in this universe… that’s when life reveals its magic in surprising ways.

I’ve been actively experimenting with applying this understanding to my relationships as well. It's fascinating to observe how differently these connections feel when you release the need to control everything, when you allow people the freedom to be who they authentically are instead of who you think they should be according to your preferences and projections. It’s like… the more I let go of rigid expectations and demands, the more genuine and vibrant these relationships naturally become.

There’s something particularly fascinating about the creative process too – how inspiration flows with effortless grace when you manage to get your analytical mind out of the way. I was carving a stone one day, and for quite a while, I was stuck in my head about it, trying too hard to make it “good” according to some imagined standard. But then something magical shifted in my awareness, and suddenly it wasn’t “me” doing the carving anymore in any conventional sense. It was as if the stone itself was gradually revealing its form through my hands. I completely lost track of time in that state of pure flow. Came back to normal awareness hours later with dust covering my hands and this profound sense of having been part of something far greater than my individual self.

Through direct experience, I’m learning that true surrender isn’t passive or weak at all as some might think. It’s actually this moment-by-moment conscious choice to step courageously into the unknown and trust that the universe has a greater wisdom than our limited minds can comprehend. It’s about releasing our desperate need for control and opening ourselves fully to what is, rather than remaining caught in our ideas about what we think should be. Much easier to talk about than to actually live, though, isn’t it?

Sometimes, in moments of quiet contemplation, I find myself imagining my existence as an inseparable part of this vast, endless cosmic dance. Countless stars being born and dying in spectacular supernovas, entire galaxies spinning in their celestial ballet, planets tracing their eternal orbits through the void, and here I am – a brief but conscious flicker of awareness in this infinite flow of existence. But even in my brevity, I’m fundamentally connected to the whole. Even in my apparent smallness, I’m woven into the fabric of all that is. My very atoms were forged in the hearts of ancient stars, and they will one day become part of something entirely new.

The ancient wisdom traditions understood these profound truths at a deep level. That’s precisely why they chose to call it uni-verse. One turning. One change. One eternal moment of perpetual transformation. In our modern reality we’re not really discovering anything new – we’re simply realizing what the ancients knew, what our bodies have always known at a cellular level, what the very nature of reality has been ceaselessly trying to communicate to us since the beginning of time.

My understanding of death has been transforming lately too. Instead of seeing it as this final, terrible ending to be feared and avoided, I’m beginning to recognize it as an integral part of the natural flow of existence. Everything in the natural world moves through these endless cycles of birth, death, and rebirth. The seasons, the cycles of the moon, the rising and setting of the sun – why should human consciousness be any different? Perhaps what we typically call death is simply another form of transformation, another turning in this infinite cosmic dance that never truly begins or ends.

There’s something profoundly liberating about embracing this deeper understanding of reality. I don’t have to carry the impossible burden of having everything figured out. I don’t need to know with certainty where all of this is ultimately going. My role isn’t to somehow direct or control the river of life – it’s to learn to swim with it gracefully, to trust its ancient wisdom, to allow it to carry me exactly where I need to go for my highest evolution.

And the synchronicities – they seem to multiply once you start paying attention with awareness. Those remarkable moments of perfect timing, those seemingly random “coincidences” that feel more like gentle whispers from the universe itself. Like yesterday’s experience, when exactly the book I needed somehow found its way into my hands at precisely the right moment. These aren’t mere chance occurrences but rather confirmations of our deeper connection to the whole.

I’ve been practicing this approach where instead of forcefully trying to implement changes in my life according to some mental plan, I attempt to align myself more naturally with the changes that are already wanting to happen through me. It’s similar to… you know that experience when you’re swimming in the ocean, and you can either exhaust yourself fighting against the powerful waves or learn to move in harmony with them? When you resist and fight, you quickly become depleted. But when you learn to move with their natural rhythm, there’s this… effortless grace that emerges naturally.


I’ve been consciously applying this understanding to my work as well. Instead of forcing myself to push through periods of natural resistance, I’m learning to notice and honor the times when I’m naturally energized and aligned with the flow of creativity and productivity. When I work with these natural rhythms rather than against them, I find that not only does the quality of my work improve dramatically, but the entire experience becomes more enjoyable and fulfilling. Sometimes this means working intensely during periods of natural inspiration, while other times it means allowing myself to rest and recharge when my energy naturally ebbs.

Perhaps this is what all the great spiritual teachers throughout history have been trying to help us understand. That we’re not actually separate from this vast flow of existence as we so often believe. We’re not isolated islands standing alone in the middle of a flowing river of life. We ARE the river itself in human form. The flow isn’t some external force we need to somehow tap into or connect with – it’s what we fundamentally are at our deepest level of being. Our very essence is this flow, this dance, this eternal movement of life expressing itself through temporary forms.

I’m gradually learning to say yes to all of it, to embrace the totality of human experience. The moments of transcendent joy and the periods of deep pain. The times of effortless ease and the challenges that stretch us beyond our comfort zones. The beautiful blossoming of growth and the necessary decay that makes new life possible. Because it's all one seamless movement, isn’t it? One vast, beautiful, terrible, magnificent flow of being expressing itself in infinite ways. And I’m not separate from any of it. I never was. I never could be. This understanding brings both profound responsibility and incredible freedom.

Sometimes the most profound and transformative truths are also the simplest and most obvious once we have eyes to see them. Like this morning, I was simply sitting with my steaming cup of coffee, watching with fascination as the delicate wisps of steam rose and spiraled in the crisp morning air. And suddenly it hit me with the force of revelation – that’s me too. That’s all of us. Rising, spiraling, dissolving, becoming something new in each moment. Over and over and over again in this eternal dance of transformation. The steam wasn’t just showing me its nature, but revealing my own nature to me in that moment of clarity.

Maybe that’s the greatest gift of this deepening understanding – this profound sense of belonging to something far greater than ourselves. Of being an integral part of something so vast and incomprehensibly beautiful that my limited human mind can’t fully grasp or contain it. But the beautiful truth is that I don’t need to intellectually comprehend it all. I just need to flow with it, trust it, allow it to move through me and as me in each moment. My role is to be a conscious participant in this grand dance of existence.

And so here I sit, allowing these thoughts to flow through my awareness like water moving through a stream bed. Each moment entirely unique and different from the last. Each breath marking a new beginning in this eternal now. Each heartbeat serving as a reminder that I am alive, I am changing, I am the change itself expressing through this particular form. The universe isn’t something out there, separate from who and what I am. It’s what I am in my deepest essence. What we all are at our core. One vast, eternal moment of transformation, expressing itself in infinite ways through all forms and phenomena.

One verse. One change. One eternal dance of being. And I am dancing it, whether I remember this truth in each moment or not. We all are, every single one of us. Maybe that’s enough. Maybe that’s absolutely everything. Maybe in that simple understanding lies the key to living with both grace and purpose in this magnificent mystery we call life.

From the state of Deleware:

""Clean and disinfect vehicles. Don’t walk through or drive trucks, tractors, or equipment in areas where waterfowl or other wildlife feces may be. If you can’t avoid this, thoroughly clean your shoes, vehicle, and equipment to prevent bringing disease agents back to your flock. This is especially important when visiting with farmers or those who hunt wildfowl, such as when gathering at a local coffee shop, restaurant, or gas station.

Remove loose feed. Don’t give wild birds, rodents, and insects a free lunch! Remove spilled or uneaten feed immediately and ensure feed storage units are secure and free of holes. Wild birds can carry HPAI.

Keep visitors to a minimum. Only allow those who take care of your poultry to come in contact with your birds, including family and friends. Make sure everyone who has contact with your flock follows biosecurity principles.

Wash your hands before and after coming in contact with live poultry. Wash with soap and water (always your first choice). If using hand sanitizer, remove manure, feathers, and other materials from your hands because disinfectants will not penetrate organic matter or caked-on dirt.

Provide disposable boot covers (preferred) or disinfectant footbaths for anyone having contact with your flock. If using a footbath, remove all droppings, mud, or debris from boots and shoes using a long-handled scrub brush BEFORE stepping into the disinfectant footbath, and always keep it clean.

Change clothes before entering poultry areas and before exiting the property. Visitors should wear protective outer garments or disposable coveralls, boots, and headgear when handling birds. Shower out and change clothes when leaving the facility.

Clean and disinfect tools or equipment before moving them to a new poultry facility. Before allowing vehicles, trucks, tractors, or tools and equipment (e.g., egg flats and cases) that have come in contact with birds or their droppings to exit the property, ensure they are cleaned and disinfected to prevent contaminated equipment from transporting disease. Do not move or reuse items that cannot be cleaned and disinfected, such as cardboard egg flats.""",1,1739467826.0,u_Downtown_Spirit_8410,0,1.0,False

Since it's Valentine's day tomorrow I thought about asking her to grab some coffee or to hang out after school (perhaps even confessing to her), but I don't know if I'm going too fast and I don't want to scare her away. I'll explain the history below; sorry for the essay, but I want you to get a feel for the situation.

It started a few weeks ago when we began having eye contact and short chats in class. I tried talking to her a bit more in class and although sometimes she got a bit shy, she didn't really initiate with me and was always with her friends, so I thought she saw me as just a classmate and I didn't want to be weird and just tried to move on. Now for the last (2) week(s), she's been suddenly initiating a lot of conversations with me and smiling at me a lot, even coming up to me with a friend during the lunch break trying to talk to me. Yesterday she was with one friend and she smiled and waved at me while I walked past her so I suddenly got very nervous, smiled and waved back and thought about walking further, but I thought fuck it literally turned around and went to talk with her. I got a bit flirty (in a subtle way) and she laughed and blushed a lot while having a lot of eye contact (all of this I've never seen her do to other guys).

I thought I'd left enough hints, but the thing is, we're not really best friends or something, and I don't really know everything about her hobbies or daily life. Whenever we talked in class it was mainly about our weekends or I we asked about how our exams went, but it's not like I know her favourite food or the music she likes. I generally want to know about her and her interests, because she's just cool as heck, but it's not like we're in a talking stage or smt. I do have her number, but we've never texted either.
