If you spend 15 minutes with it, you’ll walk away with:

**Five Payoffs You’ll Get**

**1. See AI as your Super-Assistant**

* The guide shows how to off-load three work killers, repetitive grunt work, skill bottlenecks, and “where-do-I-start?” ambiguity, so you spend more time on strategy.

**2. A One-Page Framework to Spot Easy Wins**

* Almost every real-world use case slots into one of these categories: Content Creation, Research, Data Analysis, Ideation & Strategy, Automation, and (if you feel brave) Coding. Use the list to brainstorm where AI can help your own workflow.

**3. Proof That First Drafts Save Real Hours**

* Promega chopped 135 hours off email production in six months by letting ChatGPT crank out first drafts, then polishing in-house. You can replicate that tomorrow.

**4. A Two-Axis Prioritization Map**

* The Impact-vs-Effort matrix helps you rank ideas, nail “high-ROI focus” projects, and shelve the shiny but time-sucking ones.

**5. A Vision for Full-Workflow Automation**

* The last section sketches how teams chain AI from deep research → data crunch → ideation → copy → auto-localization. It’s a teaser of where marketing ops is headed.

**Why It’s Worth Your Coffee Break**

* Zero jargon: Written for business users, not engineers.
* Field-tested: Draws from 600+ enterprise use cases, so you skip guesswork.
* Action items on almost every page: You’ll leave with prompts and checklists you can copy-paste into tomorrow’s stand-up.
* Momentum builder: Quick wins earn internal buy-in, which unlocks budget for bigger bets.

**Quick Start Challenge**

Prompt to try today:

>I’m a non-technical marketer. Here are 5 old emails + our brand tone guide. Suggest 3 newsletter themes, each with a 5-bullet outline, a CTA, and a preview snippet.

**NEXT STEPS (3-Minute Plan)**

1. Download & Skim: Grab the PDF and speed-read the headlines.
2. Write a “Pain List"": Jot down 3 tasks you did this week that felt repetitive or stalled.
3. Pick ONE Quick Win: Circle the task with highest impact / lowest effort, drop it into ChatGPT, and measure how many minutes you save.

Done! You’ve just taken your first step into AI-powered marketing.

He walked alongside people—healing, teaching, sharing meals—and never once checked his watch. He knew our struggles, our doubts, our fears, and still chose to lay down His life so we could know God’s love firsthand.

Imagine having someone who would spend hours listening when you pour out your heart, someone who speaks truth with grace, and someone who sticks by you even when life gets messy. That’s exactly who Jesus is. He didn’t just preach from afar; He got into the mud, touched the outcasts, and made time for every individual who needed hope.

1l5fkk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/longtermcomedown/comments/1l5fkk8/ltc_sleep_disturbances/,LTC Sleep Disturbances,"Sleep disturbances are a core feature of Long-Term Comedown (LTC), encompassing insomnia, frequent waking, light or non-restorative sleep, and difficulty achieving deep sleep stages. These disturbances exacerbate other symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, cognitive fog, and physical fatigue, creating a vicious cycle that hinders recovery.

**Case Study**: A Reddit user reported waking every two hours and experiencing non-restorative sleep five months after MDA use, which worsened anxiety and visual symptoms. They implemented a strict sleep routine (consistent bedtime, no screens 2 hours prior), breathwork, and magnesium supplementation, achieving improved sleep quality within months.

**Case Study 2**: A Bluelight user, 11 months into LTC, described insomnia alongside eye floaters and head pressure. Mirtazapine, prescribed for sleep and depression, provided partial relief, but side effects prompted discontinuation. Another user found magnesium glycinate effective for inducing relaxation and reducing nighttime waking, supporting gradual sleep normalization.

Causes and impacts include:

* **Neurological Dysregulation**: MDMA’s impact on serotonin and dopamine systems may disrupt sleep-wake cycles, as noted in Bluelight posts.
* **Anxiety and Hyperarousal**: Chronic stress maintains a heightened autonomic state, preventing deep sleep. Reddit users link sleep issues to panic attacks.
* **Stimulant Use**: Caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine, even in small amounts, are reported to fragment sleep, with Bluelight users citing evening coffee as a trigger.
* **Impact**: Poor sleep impairs cognitive function, emotional regulation, and physical recovery, prolonging LTC duration.

Mitigation strategies include:

* **Sleep Hygiene**: Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a dark, cool bedroom, and avoiding screens 1–2 hours before bed to reduce blue light exposure. Bluelight users recommend blackout curtains and white noise machines.
* **Supplements**: Magnesium (glycinate, citrate) to promote relaxation; melatonin for sleep onset, though cautioned for long-term use. Reddit users suggest low doses (0.5–3mg) under medical guidance.
* **Relaxation Techniques**: Guided meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, or sleep-focused apps to calm the mind. Bluelight users endorse mindfulness-based sleep programs.
* **Stimulant Avoidance**: Eliminating caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine, particularly after midday, to prevent sleep disruption. Reddit users report significant improvements post-abstinence.
* **Professional Support**: Consultation with sleep specialists or psychiatrists for persistent insomnia, with medications like Mirtazapine or Trazodone occasionally used.
* **Lifestyle**: Regular exercise (avoiding late evenings), stress reduction, and a balanced diet to support circadian rhythms.

Restorative sleep is critical for neurological recovery, as it facilitates brain repair and emotional resilience. Both Reddit and Bluelight communities emphasize the compounding benefits of addressing sleep early in LTC recovery.",1,1749283263.0,longtermcomedown,0,1.0,False

I feel envious whenever I see group of women na nageenjoy together; being girls, make up, shopping, eat outs, everything! And I just don’t know where I can find them :(

1l5fjhq,https://www.reddit.com/r/longtermcomedown/comments/1l5fjhq/impact_of_stimulants_on_ltc_symptoms_avoidance/,Impact of Stimulants on LTC Symptoms: Avoidance and Management Strategies,"Stimulants, including caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and recreational drugs, are consistently reported to exacerbate Long-Term Comedown (LTC) symptoms, such as anxiety, derealization, cognitive fog, panic attacks, and physical discomfort, by overstimulating a hypersensitive nervous system. These substances may disrupt neurological recovery, prolonging symptom duration and intensity.

**Case Study**: A Reddit user experienced a severe panic attack 15 minutes after consuming 180mg of caffeine, their first in a year, requiring a benzodiazepine to manage symptoms. Another user ceased caffeine entirely, reporting marked reductions in derealization and anxiety within weeks.

**Case Study 2**: A Bluelight user, two years post-MDMA, noted symptom exacerbation (tension headaches, heightened anxiety) after a 10µg LSD microdose, indicating sensitivity to psychoactive substances. Another reported a two-day setback in anxiety and cognitive clarity after consuming three beers, underscoring alcohol’s impact. Cocaine and ketamine were also cited in Reddit chats as prolonging symptoms, with cocaine causing weeks-long anxiety spikes due to dopamine surges.

Comprehensive management strategies include:

* **Complete Abstinence**: Avoiding all stimulants, including caffeine (coffee, energy drinks), alcohol, nicotine (cigarettes, vaping), and recreational drugs (e.g., cannabis, psychedelics, stimulants), during the initial recovery phase to minimize neurological stress. Bluelight users note that even small amounts (e.g., a single coffee) can trigger setbacks lasting days to weeks.
* **Cautious Reintroduction**: After significant symptom stabilization (often 6–12 months), testing minimal doses of substances like alcohol or caffeine, with careful monitoring over days to assess impact. Users recommend starting with non-alcoholic beverages or decaf to mimic social rituals.
* **Alternative Options**: Adopting non-stimulant alternatives, such as herbal teas (chamomile, peppermint), decaffeinated coffee, or sparkling water, to maintain social engagement without risking symptom flares.
* **Symptom Tracking**: Maintaining a detailed journal to identify specific triggers, noting dosage, timing, and symptom changes. Bluelight users suggest apps or notebooks for precision.
* **Education**: Understanding individual sensitivities, as some users report tolerance to certain substances (e.g., ketamine) while others experience universal intolerance.

The rationale for stimulant avoidance lies in MDMA’s impact on serotonin and dopamine systems, which leaves the brain vulnerable to overstimulation. Bluelight posts frequently cite caffeine as a primary trigger for panic and derealization, while alcohol is noted for inducing next-day anxiety or “hangxiety.” Recreational drugs, including cannabis and psychedelics, are particularly risky, with users reporting relapses after minimal exposure.

I have a few questions, both about what I’m doing with the brew, and a fault that I think I have with the Flair. I would really appreciate some help as I’m losing my mind a bit…

Here’s the setup / what I think should be achieving:

INPUT
18g medium roast coffee
Fine grind (around the 2 mark on a TIMEMORE sculptor 064s)

OUTPUT / METHOD
Pre-extraction at 1 bar until 2g yield
Extraction at 9 bar until 30g yield
Extraction at 6 bar for remaining 10g until 40g final yield
40s extraction time

ISSUES / QUESTIONS
1. I’m finding that often the brew chamber goes up to one side slightly when pressed down. Coffee then spurts out and I lose pressure - is this a problem with the rubber seal at the bottom of the brew chamber?
2. Why is the coffee spurting out? (0.41 on this video)
3. Is my method in general (yields etc) correct?
4. How long should pre-extraction take to reach 2g?
5. Should I include pre-extraction in the overall extraction time?

I woke up early, prayed Eid prayer, and decided to treat myself to a quiet breakfast at a coffee shop. Came back feeling good — until I saw my parked car had been hit.

Apparently, a 19-year-old genius managed to crash into my properly parked car while the road was mostly empty. No one else around. Just me, my parked car, and this kid who somehow found a way to hit it.

And of course, it's Eid holiday, so all the insurance offices are closed. I’m stuck with a dented car, scuffed bumper, and zero way to get anything moving until businesses open again.

What annoyed me the most wasn’t even the accident — it was this kid's attitude. He was so casual about the whole thing. ""It’s fine, bro. I’ll fix it, my insurance will cover it."" Like… what?! You hit a parked car while I was getting coffee. It's not ""fine."" I now have to deal with paperwork, wait days for claims, and possibly miss family plans — all because some teenager thinks insurance is a magic undo button.

I get that accidents happen. But if you're going to mess up someone’s day, at least show a shred of remorse or accountability.

Anyway, Eid Mubarak to everyone else. Hope yours started better than mine.

Most pieces I'd like to be ""food safe"" but we're mostly talking plates with a chip on the edge - not coffee mugs.

None of these repairs will require high heat. Just areas that may come into contact with food. Examples: vintage plastic handle on a ladle, chip on edge or bottom of dish, a salad plate etc. 

Everything will be hand washed, never run through a dishwasher. 

Next step in my kit is to apply the Bengala Urushi & follow with metal powder. I have brass powder for practice & gold for the items I care about & want to use with food.  

I also have a couple of glass repairs  & purchased some ""Glass Urushi"". These are for milk glass sconce shades. 

I believe I should apply the red/glass Urushi (depending on material) & let it cure on areas that may require more than one coat. 

1. After item is repaired with non traditional epoxy/putty & adhesives have cured - NOW Urushi is applied? 
2. I should apply multiple layers of Urushi until I'm happy with the smooth surface. Kit instructions say to wait 12 hrs between coats. 
3. At the time of the last Urushi application, I should test coverage & tackiness before possibly applying another Urushi coat - then starting with the brass/gold?
4. Please advise for brass/gold application techniques & timing.

I have a moka pot I love using, and sometimes I go with a French press or even my Nespresso machine when I'm in a rush. However, I get it.

Some people spend hundreds (or thousands) on a home espresso setup. They weight the perfect amount of beans, measure shot times to the second, and spend 15 minutes pulling a perfect double espresso. And that's fine. 

People spends money and time on all sorts of hobbies like cars, mechanical keyboards, gaming pcs, watches, whatever. Trying to make the perfect espresso at home is no different. There’s a skill to learn. And it's also a ritual. Perfecting espresso at home is no weirder than perfecting sourdough or craft beer.

For some it's about starting the day doing something well. Grinding beans, aerating the grounded coffee, watching the shot bloom. It can be therapeutic for some the same way people spend an hour painting Warhammer miniatures. It’s not about efficiency but about the joy of doing something the best way you can.

And also, a nice espresso is sooo good.

You don’t need to justify hobbies to anyone. If it makes your mornings better, helps you unwind, or just scratches a perfectionist itch, then it's a really valid reason to spend money and time.

1l5f8h4,https://www.reddit.com/r/employmenttribunal/comments/1l5f8h4/discriminated_in_probation_period/,Discriminated in probation period,"Hi all,

I'm not sure if I'm going mental or not. 

I got a job 2 months ago and it turned out to be not the role they sold. I flagged small thinks here and there and they apologised for misrepresenting certain parts of the role in the interview. 

At the beginning of the second month, someone made a racist and islamophobic comment and everyone seemed pretty chill with it however I reported it. Nothing was done about it. 

I them declared harassment as this one colleague that has always shared the role with the manager before me, has spoken innaproiately to me on multiple occasions and I have told her each time that I suffer with anxiety and her behaviour triggers it and she apologised each time. Reported to CEO (small company, no HE, no policies) and they said they have been investigating but I only found out yesterday, no one informed me initiating an investigation. 

They failed to follow my reasonable adjustments which they agreed to and they refused to approve a couple of them, without providing extra support or suggestions, just a cold no. 

I have been put at a disadvantage on serveral occasions, for example when Ben my anxiety started being bad, my performance deppped and now they are investigating me for performance too. Or they allow people in office having coffee breaks but I didn't get extra breaks when I asked to heal with health. 


My friends say that as I am on probation no one will take this seriously in tribunal. They have no legal experience, more of a suggestion. HOWEVER, unite the union has also put emphasis on the short period I have been with them and she says not much legal basis nor detriments although the have exacerbated multiple of my conditions (medical evidence) and my quality of life has gone down significantly due too being too ill + extra money spent to deal with day to day tasks (I am on full pip and I was trying to return to work but looks I am an outcast.)

Any advice would be massively appreciated. ",1,1749281863.0,employmenttribunal,0,1.0,False

Now, I’ve heard it said somewhere that nothing magical or transcendent is going to happen to you in your life by looking at a screen. And while I mostly agree with this sentiment, life can surprise us sometimes. 

In the last few decades or so we started experiencing everything through screens. In our living rooms, then later through the ones on our desks, then more recently the little ones in our pockets. Hell, you’re probably reading this on one of them right now…  

But I digress. I’m gonna try to tell a story. 

I was twenty years old and struggling to escape my small town after the death of my best friend and the subsequent 2-year bender I’d been on. I convinced my then-girlfriend that we needed to get out. Somewhere far away. As luck would have it, around the same time her brother came down to visit from Boston and expressed that he might be able to get me an interview for some low-level position in a software company where he worked. I jumped at the chance, aced the interview and was packing my things for Boston in no time. 

In my world and especially at this time, having a “computer job” felt exhilarating. Not only could I learn a lot, but also could chat with people and fuck around on the internet while doing my job. Back before social media destroyed basic human decency, people used to meet strangers this way. I talked to everyone, dozens of people from all over the world. ICQ was an international chat messenger that could randomly link you up with any user and I was a junky. Bookish and quiet as I was in real life, the internet was the one place where I had some game. 

One day, upon coming back from my lunch break, I was met with three words.

* “Talk to us”

“Who are you?”, I typed. 

* “2 girls from Poland”

“You know what they say about Polish girls, don’t you?”

I can’t even remember what I followed it up with. It didn't matter. They were instantly intrigued. 

Ewa (Eva) and Ania were just some high school girls looking to improve their English, and so I indulged them. I was a proficient online flirt. Ewa, just the right mix of intelligent and demure, cracked me up. We chatted almost every day.

Eventually things in Boston, and thus my computer job and my relationship with my girlfriend, didn’t pan out. I wanted to stay, build a new life up there despite the insane cost of everything and she missed home. 

And so little more than a year after I left, I found myself back at my uncle’s construction company in New Jersey, tail between my legs, lifting heavy shit all day and coming home in dirty clothes. There I was, warming a barstool in my hometown and wondering if I’d ever get out again. All around me, the clutches of small town life… the local watering hole with all the usual suspects… made me feel like the walls were closing in on me. My chat sessions with Ewa had dwindled down into 2 or 3 emails a month; I logged on every so often to check in with her. 

At about the same time, I started working with Grover. 

Now, to go into all the details of how exquisitely weird he is would take many pages and a whole story, so suffice it to say that he was a disruptor of things. The year previous, while I was trying on a buttoned-up, business-casual lifestyle in Boston, he’d schlepped his gangly ass across Europe all by himself… staying in hostels and hanging out with expat trust-fund babies. He filled my head with all kinds of stories. We’d spend all day in a truck working alongside each other, and every day he goaded me. 

* “Europe, bro! Europe! We gotta go! Sleep in hostels! Meet some European girls… see some amazing shit!” 

The teenage bookworm in me had read about and romanticised the idea of visiting Europe for years, but such things seemed above my station in life. In my mind, it was a place for people who “did a semester abroad” or whose parents belonged to a country club. This was my chance to finally see it. While I didn’t exactly have all the money, Momma raised me with enough good sense to pay my bills and develop a good credit history… so I could put it on my card. Was it worth the debt? 

Whatever reservations I might have had about the whole thing were washed away in an instant by Grover’s sage advice: 

* “Look man, I know it’s easier said than done… that’s true… but trust me… it’s easier done than regretted (later in life).” 

Ok not exactly grammatically correct, but the man had a point.

So we worked, we planned, saved a bit of cash, eventually bought a rail pass and flights… all the while hyping each other up for it. I told Ewa about our plans and she invited us to come to Poland, but that wasn’t on the agenda. Poland? Maybe someday, but we had better and more important destinations in mind. Hell, at that time I’m not sure I could have found it on a map.

April arrived. Go time.

First stop - Amsterdam. 

To say that it was everything I’d imagined would be understating it. Amsterdam is a gem. Spring had arrived and the buds on the trees were glowing a pale green that seemed to complement every canal-lined avenue. The buildings and streets and coffee shops were, to my American mind, something straight out of a movie. I must have looked like a total geek. 

*Four middle-aged women sitting in a cafe on their lunch break, smoking a spliff… Beautiful girls pedalling past us on old, junky bicycles… Walking through the red-light district at night, looking down a narrow alleyway, wondering what the soft, red glow of those windows might reveal once you were standing directly in front of them… tripping on mushrooms in the park... the cold realization that it’s completely obvious to the entire world that you’re a tourist, and an American one at that.* 

These vignettes exist, somewhere in the old shoebox of my memory, as blurry snapshots… far more of them than can be recounted here, so I’ll keep this relatively short.

After three or four revelrous days, it was onward to Paris.

The sheer size of it was overwhelming. Arriving by train, we had to trudge across the entire city to find the hostel we were looking for from the *Frommer’s Europe on 70$ a day* guidebook - the ‘backpacker’s bible'. Any romantic notions I’d had about the city were rapidly fading. Unlike Amsterdam, it wasn’t very walkable. Apart from the child-like wonder of seeing the Eiffel Tower in the distance, I remember almost nothing about that day, just that we were exhausted when we finally settled into our little hostel.

At around midnight, still awake and reading my book and excited for the following day, Grover walked up to me. 

* “Hey, I gotta get the fuck out of here.”, he said.

At first I thought he was already sick of France or something and wanted to move on to Barcelona, step three. 

I muttered something along the lines of - “but we just got here today…?” 

* “No.”, he interrupted, “I’m going home.” 

While I was reading, he had called his mother and found out that she’d just decided to sell his childhood home in the next two weeks. We had three weeks left in our trip. 

“Whaaaat… the fuck dude?” 

Panic washed over me like a cold shower. Truth be told, at that moment I wanted to leave with him. It was my first time outside of my country and I was terrified. What I said next is lost to my memory. I’m sure I was sputtering justifications about why I should also leave, but was cut off by my friend - 

* “You should stay.” 
* “Here - ”, he said, shoving the ‘bible’ into my chest*,* “ - take it.  Have your own adventure.” 

What is one to do in this situation? 

That night, sleep didn’t come easy. The upside to traveling alone is that you have no one to answer to. There are no debates about what to eat, what to see or where to go, but it's incredibly lonely. The plan we had outlined was to see Paris then go on to Barcelona, then Rome.. then home. I could change the plan to whatever I wanted. I wish I could tell you that at this moment I let go of all my inhibitions and leaned into the possibilities and plotted a fearless journey into the ether, engaging every smiling face and shaking every hand. That certainly crossed my mind. But this ain't no fairy tale. I wasn’t that guy. 

Was it fear of being alone that kept me thinking about the only person on the entire continent that I knew? Was it a sense of adventure? Something else?

I woke the next morning with a few clear goals in my head. First was to find an internet cafe and make contact with Ewa. I told her what had happened. 

* “Does this mean that you’re coming to Poland?”

“I don’t know.”, I replied. “I need time to think about it. Is the invitation still open?”

* “Of course.”

Let’s back up a bit. A few years prior to this whole story, my mother had walked into a casino in Atlantic City and won a ‘door prize’ - an all-expenses paid trip for two to Munich, Germany. The trip of a lifetime for my mom, who had hardly traveled beyond New Jersey.  She’d spent the time afterward regaling me with stories of how magical and fairy-tale-like it all was. “You *have to* see it!!” 

Munich *was* in the right direction, after all. Right?  

More blurry snapshots. *A French toddler riding his scooter up to me and asking me something, my reply “Je ne comprends pas le français”, and the scrunched up look on his face … thinking to myself “THAT is the Mona Lisa?! It’s the size of a fucking stamp!” … getting lost in the Metro and asking for help from a woman who could barely contain her chuckling at my horrible French. she was warm, nonetheless… the elevator ride through the massive, imposing guts of the Eiffel Tower… a train ride through Bavaria which, indeed, is like a fairy tale.*

Munich.

As the train pulled in it was getting dark. I had no idea where I was going to sleep. Panicking, I found a tourist info center to ask where the nearest hostel was. I would have killed for the little pocket screen to tell me where to go. That world hadn’t been invented yet.

A mid-40s German woman greeted me as I walked into her little office. The nearest hostel? Two blocks away. I then asked her how I might get to Prague, another waypoint between me and Ewa. Looking back, I may not remember what this woman looked like, but I’ll always remember what she said. 

* “Where are you going?” ... “What’s your final destination?”

“Well, I’m not sure. I’ve got this invitation from a person I met online to stay with them in Poland. Like, a regular Polish family.”

* “And you’re not sure if you want to go?”

I shrugged … 

* “Why not?”

“Well, I don't *really* know this person. It’s not something I’m sure I would offer *them* if they were coming to me in America. Ya know? It feels a little weird.”

There was something in the way she looked at me. Was she sizing me up? 

* “I think you should go.”, she said. “I think you’ll be surprised.”

“Really?”

Her smile and nod were all the confirmation I needed.

And that was it. I was in. 

At the hostel, the clerk told me that he was all booked up, but that if his reservation didn’t arrive in the next twenty minutes then I could have a bed. I waited and silently prayed. In hindsight, it was funny but at the time I must have looked like a frightened rabbit. Unable to speak the language and not knowing where you are going to lay your head at night can be pretty intense. But they never came, so I got the bed. Giddy, I threw my backpack on top of it and went straight down to the bar. 

Walking into the crowded pub area, the only available seat was at a small table where a cute girl was sitting. 

“Do you mind if I sit here?” 

* “No… please.”, she motioned for me to sit. 

After an agonizingly long time “reading my book” I mustered up the courage to talk to her. 

“So… where are you from?”

* “New Jersey. What about you?” 

“Get the fuck outta here… I’M from New Jersey!”

Serendipity is a funny thing. We decided to stick together and do touristy stuff. Bike trips and museums and eating out. Evenings in the pub with the beautiful Danish bartender and the old Eurotrash dude who’s far too old to be hanging out here but unable to stay away from the college backpacker girls. Some sisters from Australia. A cast of characters as colorful as any circus, or maybe that’s just what my booze-addled brain kept telling me. I had a blast. I was finding my feet. 

*A moment of clarity in my drunken pub haze, a feeling of being untethered, young, alive, a stranger in a strange land and relishing it…   “Up ahead we’re going to see a nude beach on the riverbank. But don’t worry, you won’t see anything too risque. You’re more likely to see reasons why you shouldn’t drink beer and eat sausages for 60 years”… the stark outline of the letters ARBEIT MACHT FREI relieved against the overcast sky at Dachau, and the sad choir of Israeli students singing at the incinerators… the seating area at the Hofbrau house, just pick a seat and strike up conversation with whoever is there, the way the world should be… someone giving me a little card with the name of a Prague hostel on it, The Clown and what?*

Arriving in Prague was a bit of a shock, like I had traveled back in time another 20 years or more. It lacked the pastel, Bavarian quaintness of Munich. It seemed far more brutalist and dingy to me. *This* was Eastern Europe. I couldn’t escape the thought that only a dozen years or so had passed since Communism collapsed. 

It began downpouring as soon as my train pulled into the city. Heavy, sideways rain. Briskly walking out of the train station and trying to find a taxi, I caught a glimpse of something in the corner of my eye. Was someone following me? … Uh huh. 

I began shucking and jiving through the kiosks outside the train station to throw him off. A young gypsy perhaps? He was right behind me every step of the way and gaining on me. Seeing the glass doors of the train station up ahead, I immediately ducked back inside the station and spun around to look through the glass and lock eyes with him. He jumped back like something had bit him. I pointed my finger at him as he snapped his head away and tried to look innocent. 

Crossing the station to the other side, I ran to a parked taxi. “The Clown and Bard?”, I said as I handed the card to the driver. 

At this point in the trip the combination of the non-stop rain, the close call with a thief at the train station and the loneliness of solo travel had started to catch up with me. I was feeling tired and just a bit depressed. 

The entrance to the place was on the street, but you had to walk down into a basement pub area, check-in, then go upstairs to find a bed. I seemed to be the only person in the whole place for a while, until early in the evening the bar began to fill up. As I sat reading my book, a few guys walked up to my table and asked if they could sit with me. 

“Ok.”  

They were black, which was something that seemed out of place in eastern Europe. They seemed a bit shady, didn’t say much to me or each other, so I ignored them. After a short while, one of them leans over to me and says, 

* “Hey man… you smoke?” and gives me the international gesture for smoking a joint.

“Yeah, sure.”, I hadn’t smoked since Amsterdam. 

* “You wanna go outside and smoke with us?” 

My mind raced… ‘*here we go*’, I thought ‘*I’ll go outside and the first thing I’ll feel is a sucker-punch to my ear*.’  But I didn’t want to be rude, and a joint sounded like just what I needed. 

“Give me a second.”, I said, and instantly ran up the stairs to my bed and put away all my money and my passport. I came back.

* “Ready?” 

“Sure.” 

I braced for a scuffle as I walked outside, literally held my breath… but… nothing. The guy lit up a joint and passed it to me, cool as can be. Turns out he lived there. He and his boys were in a reggae band and his wife was Czech. They’d come there for movie night, when all the locals pile in and hang out with the backpackers to watch a movie on the giant pull-down projector screen. That night was the first time in my life I’d ever seen *Monty Python’s Meaning of Life*, and it was truly a gift to get to watch it with a group of complete strangers, laughing our asses off in unison. 

All this time, I’d been keeping a rough correspondence with my Polish friend, updating her on what I was doing and the progress I was making. She’d agreed to meet me after Prague. Somehow, I managed to buy tickets to her small city in Poland. I say somehow because the language barrier was pretty insurmountable and the trip wasn't exactly easy to plot out.  After two days, I decided Prague was a wash… the rain wouldn’t stop and the idea of sloshing around through it all day just seemed like it would make me even more depressed. I just wanted to get on to my destination. *I’ll see it another day*, I thought. On my last night I went out to a shitty club with a few people that mostly bored me. Or maybe I bored them? 

*The trains looked like something straight out of 1984, Slavic graffiti all over the outside, upholstered seats that were clearly older than I was… a disturbing 2-hour delay at the border, German shepherds sniffing through the baggage… a stopover in Katowice, rushing around asking everyone “Do you speak English?”, every single person shaking their head and shrugging… holding up a little hand-drawn note with Gliwice on it… aha! I’m saying it wrong! It’s Glee-vee-tsuh… Is this the right train?*

I finally arrived in Gliwice. 

When I walked out of the train station, it was getting dark and nobody was waiting to meet me. 

Surely something was wrong. Ewa had agreed to meet me when my train arrived. Where was she?

It was then that I realized that I hadn't gotten her phone number or address. Our sole form of communication had been through email. What kind of an idiot travels across a continent to meet someone and doesn’t have their phone number or address? 

Yep. Me.

I scanned the area outside the train station looking for any sign of an internet cafe, but the likelihood of finding one seemed impossible. This was a small city, a town really, in my mind. I noticed a girl sitting there on a bench and pantomimed my way through an explanation about what I was doing there and how royally fucked I was. She could do little more than politely smile at me before she left. I decided to wait. 

After what felt like an eternity, a car pulled up in the parking lot, and a familiar face stepped out of the passenger side. 

We hugged. 

Upon entering the car, her older sister Ola immediately asked.

* “What kind of an idiot travels across a continent to meet someone and doesn’t have their phone number or address?

It turned out that the delay at the border made my train late. They had already been to the train station and waited for me and left. They decided to come back to check again. The Fates were looking out for me. 

What can I say about those first awkward days in this place? Ewa proved to be much quieter and more reserved than I ever imagined. The girl on the screen was nowhere to be found, she’d been replaced by a mousy introvert who was extremely difficult to read. Thank the gods for her sister, who never seemed to shut up. 

They made me feel welcome in their home and fed me. It was a big and lovely house, and I soon realized that her family probably had more money than mine, but the culture shock was substantial. This place lacked all of the luster of my previous destinations. Everything seemed gray and a bit dilapidated, as if the Second World War had only recently ended. This was real Poland, real people. No backpackers or trust fund kids or tourists. 

If I'm being honest, I wanted to go home. The girl I’d come to meet wasn't at all what I had expected. I was convinced that she didn’t like the person I was beyond the screen, but we’d made a few plans already and would see them through.

She showed me her city and I met a few of her friends… we took the train to Krakow, another absolute gem. We walked through its Baroque beauty, fumbled through conversations, discovering more and more about each other. No more screens to hide behind.

I started to do this thing each day, where I said - “I think I have to leave tomorrow.”

And she’d say - “Do you *have to*?”

And I’d look into her eyes and ask - “Do you *want* me to stay?”

* “Yes”

So I stayed… another day. Then another. 

I’ll spare you, dear reader, the extremely awkward details, but suffice it to say that I was falling *hard* for this girl. 

And since this was my time… my adventure… the transmutation of a criminally shy boy into a man unafraid… I told her so. 

It’s been the defining moment of my life. 

Two decades later, here I am plugging away, plotting it all out on a different screen… in my home… in Poland… and yelling at my kids to get off of *their* screens. 

So… If you think that you’ll never have a transcendent experience by looking at a screen… well… 

Never say “never”.

Two unlawful Israeli strikes on the northeastern Lebanese town of Younine between September and November 2024 were apparent indiscriminate attacks on civilians.
More and more evidence is emerging that Israeli forces repeatedly failed to protect civilians or adequately distinguish civilians from military targets during its strikes across Lebanon in 2023 and 2024.
Lebanon’s government should provide a path for justice for grieving families, including by giving the International Criminal Court jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute crimes. All countries – including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany – should suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel.
(Beirut) – Two unlawful Israeli strikes on the northeastern Lebanese town of Younine between September and November 2024, which killed 33 civilians, 15 of them children, were apparent indiscriminate attacks on civilians, Human Rights Watch said today.

At least one of the attacks used an air-dropped bomb equipped with a United States-produced Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) guidance kit. The attacks should be investigated as war crimes.

“More and more evidence is emerging that Israeli forces repeatedly failed to protect civilians or adequately distinguish civilians from military targets during its strikes across Lebanon in 2023 and 2024,” said Ramzi Kaiss, Lebanon researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Lebanon’s government should provide a path for justice for grieving families, including by giving the International Criminal Court jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute crimes.”

In May 2024, Lebanon’s former government reversed a decision which it had issued a month earlier to give the International Criminal Court (ICC) jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute serious crimes committed on Lebanese territory since October 7, 2023. Lebanon’s new government should urgently accept ICC jurisdiction to give the court’s prosecutor a mandate to investigate serious international crimes committed on the country’s territory.

#One attack, on September 25, killed a family of 23 people, all Syrians, including 13 children. On November 1, a strike on a two-story house killed 10 people, including 2 children, one of them a year old, 5 women, and 3 men. Human Rights Watch did not find any evidence of military activity or targets at either site.

Human Rights Watch investigated a third strike in Younine that occurred on November 21, which killed a family of four adults.Researchers found several Hezbollah “martyr” posters online and in Younine for one of the male victims, but were unable to verify who made the posters, and reviewed photos of his grave indicating that he may have been a Hezbollah combatant.

Between November 2024 and February 2025, Human Rights Watch researchers visited the sites of the two strikes in Younine, near Baalbeck, in eastern Lebanon. Human Rights Watch researchers also visited the cemetery in Younine and inspected the burial sites of people from the village killed in Israeli attacks, including combatants and civilians. Human Rights Watch reviewed photos and videos shared on social media in the aftermath of the strikes.

Human Rights Watch interviewed 10 people, some in person, at strike sites in Younine, and others via telephone. Weapon remnants found at the sites of the September 25 and November 21 strikes and reviewed by Human Rights Watch arms researchers indicate the Israeli military’s use of a Mk-80 series general purpose air-dropped bomb equipped with a US-made JDAM kit. Weapon remnants found at the site of the November 1 strike also indicate the Israeli military’s use of a Mk-80 series general purpose bomb.

The Israeli military did not warn civilians to evacuate before either strike, residents told Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch verified this claim by reviewing social media posts by the Israeli Arabic language spokesperson and the Israeli military’s Arabic language telegram channels, where evacuation warnings are typically shared. Human Rights Watch sent a letter outlining its findings and posing questions to the Israeli military on March 24 but has not received a response.

#Under international humanitarian law, all parties to the conflict are obligated, at all times, to distinguish between combatants and civilians and to direct attacks only against combatants or other military objectives. Individuals who commit serious violations of the laws of war with criminal intent – that is, intentionally or recklessly – may be prosecuted for war crimes. Individuals may also be held criminally liable for assisting in, facilitating, aiding, or abetting a war crime. All governments that are parties to an armed conflict are obligated to investigate alleged war crimes by members of their armed forces.

When carrying out any attack, warring parties must take all feasible precautions to minimize civilian harm and damage to civilian objects. This includes taking all necessary actions to verify that targets are military objectives.

Between October 2023 and December 2024, Israeli attacks in Lebanon killed more than 4,000 people and displaced over one million. Since the November 27 ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah came into effect, Israeli attacks have reportedly killed at least 146 people in Lebanon, including at least 26 who were attempting to return to villages where Israeli forces had not yet withdrawn. As of March 20, nearly 100,000 people remained displaced in the country from the recent conflict, according to the United Nations International Organization for Migration (IOM).

Lebanon and other United Nations member states should establish an international investigation into all human rights violations committed by all parties involved in the conflict in Lebanon. Such an investigation could document ongoing crimes, collect evidence, and publicly report on their findings. Lebanon’s government could also further its cooperation with the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and ongoing investigations into Israeli attacks in Lebanon to ensure accurate documentation of unlawful attacks, including war crimes committed between October 2023 and December 2024.

The United States government’s provision of arms to Israel, which have repeatedly been used to carry out apparent war crimes, has made the US complicit in their unlawful use. Human Rights Watch has previously documented the unlawful use of US weapons in and unlawful attack on aid workers and an apparently deliberate attack on journalists in Lebanon.

Providing military assistance to Israel violates US law, which prohibits arms transfers to “any country the government of which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations internationally recognized human rights.” All states, including Israel’s key allies such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany should suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel.

Lebanon’s parliament should also ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Human Rights Watch said.

“Countries still supplying Israel with arms, including primarily the United States, need to wake up to the reality that their continued military support, despite ample evidence of unlawful attacks, has made them complicit in the unlawful killing of civilians,” Kaiss said. “Victims have a right to justice and reparations, and those responsible should be held to account.”

September 25 Israeli Airstrike

After 10 p.m. on September 25, an Israeli airstrike struck a residential building along the main Baalbek-Qaa highway near the road junction that leads into the center of the town of Younine, killing 22 members of one extended Syrian family, including 13 children. Another family member died eight days later in a Damascus hospital as a result of his injuries. Seven people survived the attack, including three Lebanese men, six of them with various injuries.

Human Rights Watch interviewed multiple sources about the incident, including four survivors, the building’s owner, who is also the mother of one survivor, a local supermarket owner who was among the first to arrive at the scene, the mayor of Younine, a relative of the family who lives in Idlib, Syria, and a Lebanese researcher familiar with the town.

Researchers verified photos and videos of the immediate aftermath, the burial of the victims two days later, and satellite imagery. They cross-referenced a list of casualties provided by the family’s relative in Idlib with Younine’s mayor and two survivors. Researchers conducted open-source research into the names of both victims and survivors, to establish if any of them may have been or are combatants, and cross-referenced findings with open-source material shared by Airwars, a nongovernmental organization that investigates civilian harm in conflict zones. During a December 2 visit to the site, researchers viewed remnants of a bomb equipped with a United States-produced JDAM guidance kit found in the rubble.

Witnesses said that the two-story building contained two apartments on the ground floor, both rented to Syrians. The family living in the other ground floor apartment was not present at the time of the attack. Two other buildings sharing the same owner are attached to the building, one of which housed the three other branches of the Abdelkader family, and another that housed the owner and five of her other children, who had fled the building soon after Israel intensified its aerial campaign on Lebanon in September 2024. The buildings also housed a physical therapy center, a mobile phone shop, and a shuttered gas station that had been out of operation for over a year.

“My uncle’s family who lived in that building, they were planning to leave to Syria the next morning so we were all gathered there to say goodbye,” said Yousef Abdelkader, 16, who alongside his brother Mohammad, 17, and their cousin, 15-year-old Hassan, were the only survivors from the Abdelkader family in the building at the time of the attack. The attack killed their parents, siblings, grandfather, and two uncles’ families.

“Just before the strike, I left the apartment ahead of the rest of my family to return to my family’s apartment in one of the attached buildings. My mom, grandpa, and others were still standing just outside the door talking to the rest of the family when I heard the sound of a plane, and I saw the rocket fall,” said Yousef. 

Other survivors were a distant relative who also lived in Younine, the building owner’s son, who lived on the second floor, and two Lebanese neighbors. Waleed Rbeidi, the relative, said: “[When the bomb struck], I was on the ground-floor veranda with some other men from the neighborhood, friends of mine, who had called over to me to have coffee with them.”

Rbeidi and another survivor both said that they received no warning ahead of the attack. “We just heard the sound of the rocket and suddenly the house fell over their heads,” he said, telling researchers that doctors had to later remove several pieces of shrapnel from his body.

“There was no warning,” said the building owner’s son. “The munition came straight down on us. Each of us [standing in the veranda] flew in a different direction.”

Another Lebanese survivor, who lives on the same street and owns a shop nearby, described the moments leading up to the attack: “We were all staying up late together that night. For a couple of hours before the strike, I remember we didn’t hear any drones, it was quiet. All I remember from the strike is hearing a loud noise and then I lost consciousness. I spent 20 days in the hospital with shrapnel in my leg, arm, and neck.”

The Israeli military did not comment directly on the strike, but it posted on X and Telegram the next morning that its forces had struck approximately 75 Hezbollah targets in the Bekaa area and in southern Lebanon overnight, including “weapons storage facilities, ready-to-fire launchers, terrorists, and terrorist infrastructure.”

Younine’s mayor, Ali Kassas, said that two other airstrikes had targeted the town earlier that day. Human Rights Watch found no evidence of a military target in the immediate area of the September 25 strike and all those interviewed insisted there were no fighters or military equipment in the building or the neighborhood. “We are still trying to make sense of the strike, to find a reason for it,” Kassas said. “We still can’t understand why they would target a building full of Syrians. They’re not even Lebanese. The entire intersection is mostly Syrians, many […] camps around and most buildings rented to Syrians.”

Kassas described the rescue efforts: “We headed to the location immediately after we learned of the strike, ambulances too, and we pulled bodies from under the rubble. On the first day we pulled 19, we didn’t even know how many people were in the building to begin with or who they were. There was a boy who was a relative of some of the dead and he helped us identify them and said that there were others missing, including his uncle and aunt. The second day we went back and pulled out three more.”

“After the strike, dead bodies were strewn across the ground,” said Yousef, who helped rescuers identify his family members who were killed. “It was really hard for me to identify them because some of them were in pieces.”

#November 1 Strike

At around 2 p.m. on November 1, an Israeli strike on the al-Salah neighborhood in Younine destroyed a two-story building.

Human Rights Watch researchers visited the site on December 2, 2024, and February 12, 2025, and interviewed Ali Salah, who lost 10 family members in the strike. Salah lived in the same neighborhood and was in the vicinity at the time of the attack. On February 12, Human Rights Watch also spoke to another neighbor and relative of the Salah family who lived in the same neighborhood and spoke with the mayor of Younine about the strike on March 21.

Ali Salah said that those killed in the strike included his two sisters, Wadha, born 1959, and Fairouz, born 1975; his brothers-in-law:, Haidar Mahdi Salah, who worked as a painter and owned a supermarket, and Mohammad Mahdi Salah, who worked as a taxi driver; his nieces, Elissar, 27, and Zeina, 17; his nephew Ali Haidar Salah, 30, and Ali’s family, including his wife, Nour Boudaq, his son, Haidar, a year old, and his mother-in-law, Um Bachir Boudaq.

“Haidar [Mahdi Salah] works as a painter, and Mohammed works as Taxi driver,” Ali Kassas, the mayor, told Human Rights Watch. “Ali Haidar works with his dad as a painter, and the rest were children and women. Haidar [Ali Salah] was just one year old […] None of the people killed were combatants. They’re not even connected to any party.”

The strike came shortly after Mohammed Mahdi Salah returned home after finishing his shift as a taxi driver, Ali Salah said.

#Mohammed makes about LBP50,000 [around US$0.55] for a ride in the Bekaa,” he said. “All our family, the Salah family, we don’t have a single person in Hezbollah. Not a single person. Ask whoever you want.”

#There’s no one I value more than my sisters. If I thought there was any reason for there to be a military target here, I would have forced them to leave. There was nothing here. Just civilians.”

The Israeli military did not comment directly about this strike. However, a post shared on the Israeli armed forces’ telegram page on November 2, one day after the strike, stated that “over the past day, the [Israeli Air Force] struck more than 120 terror targets belonging to both Hamas and Hezbollah. These included anti-tank missile launching sites, terrorist operatives, terror infrastructure sites, weapons storage facilities, and command centers in Lebanon.”

Human Rights Watch conducted open-source research on the strike, including into the names of those killed, to determine if they were combatants. Researchers did not find any evidence indicating the presence of combatants or a military objective at the site of the strike. All individuals interviewed said that no evacuation warning was given to residents prior to the strike.

A banner outside the cemetery in Younine, which Human Rights Watch researchers visited, displayed the names and photos of people from Younine who were killed in Israeli attacks, including civilians and individuals who appear to be combatants. Photos of the male victims of the November 1 attack – including Mohmmad Mahdi Salah, Haidar Mahdi Salah, and Ali Haidar Salah – showed them in civilian clothing and appear to be designated as civilians below the photographs of apparent combatants. The names of women killed in the strike were displayed without photos. None of the individuals killed in the November 1 attack were buried in an area within the cemetery that appeared to be reserved for Hezbollah fighters.

Ali Salih described his anguish over the death of his family members. “Um Bachir [Salih’s mother-in-law] wanted to go to Ghobeiry, in Dahyeh [Beirut’s southern suburb], and I would tell her, ‘If I tell you to leave and you get killed, I will feel very guilty; If you stay and get killed, I’ll also feel very guilty. So do as you want.’”

Kassas, the mayor, who arrived at the site of the strike shortly after the attack, described horrific scenes: “The scene at the strike made our hearts cry. Some bodies did not have heads attached to them. Other bodies were flattened by the strike. One person, we just knew them by their skin and beard […] We tried to resuscitate the child [Ali Haidar] when we pulled him out, but when we checked for a pulse, he was dead.”",9,1749281374.0,lebanon,0,0.91,False
1l5f46g,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1l5f46g/the_silent_hum_of_routine/,The Silent Hum of Routine,"The smell of fresh coffee was the anchor of every morning. Not gourmet coffee, but freshly brewed coffee, with a bitter background that scratches the throat and awakens the senses. It was the aroma of home, of routine, of security. At 6:30 am, the digital alarm clock, with its red and impersonal numbers, broke the silence of my room. The gray light of dawn, filtered through the cracks in the blinds, drew pale lines on the wooden floor, a familiar pattern that I could trace with my eyes closed. Everything was predictable, comforting. Until it wasn't. That Tuesday, the glass of water that I always left on my bedside table, untouched during the night, was overturned. Not fallen, not broken, just turned upside down, with a small damp circle on the polished wood. A tiny detail, easily attributable to an inattentive movement in sleep, an invisible cat, anything. I ignored it. Life is made up of little imperfections, right? I got up, the morning ritual unfolding like a movie on repeat: brushing my teeth, washing my face, combing my unruly hair. I went down to the kitchen. My mother, sitting at the table, was reading the newspaper with the same concentrated expression as always. “Good morning, son,” she said, without looking away from the news about the economy. The same good morning as always. The same newspaper as always. The same coffee as always. The routine was a tight, familiar and sometimes suffocating hug. I finished my coffee, the bitter taste lingering on my tongue, picked up my backpack and left for college. The bus was on time, traffic flowing as usual. The people on the street, rushing around, with their headphones and distant looks, were the urban landscape that I knew. I arrived at college, attended classes, ate lunch in the noisy cafeteria. Nothing out of the ordinary. The afternoon dragged on, punctuated by notes and the teacher's monotonous voice. Upon returning home, the sun was already setting, painting the sky in orange and purple tones. I had dinner with my parents, watched some TV and, exhausted, went to bed. The glass of water was in the right place this time. I fell asleep with the familiar feeling of another day completed. But the feeling didn't last. The alarm clock rang again. 6:30 am. The gray light of dawn filtered through the cracks in the blinds. The smell of fresh coffee came from the kitchen. And my glass of water was, once again, upside down on the headboard. The wet circle, a little larger this time, seemed to stare at me.




The shock was not immediate, but the confusion was. I got up, did the same movements as the previous morning, but with a strange feeling of déjà vu. I went down to the cafe. My mother was there, reading the same newspaper, on the same page. “Good morning, son,” she said, with the same intonation. I stared at her. “Mom, don’t you think it’s strange that today’s newspaper is the same as yesterday’s?” She looked up, a wrinkle of confusion on her forehead. ""What are you talking about, honey? It's today's newspaper."" I tried to explain, but the words seemed to dissolve in my mouth. She looked at me like I was delirious. The bus was on time, the same people in the same seats. The driver, with his dented cap, gave me the same nod. At college, the classes were identical, the professor's jokes, the classmates' questions. I tried to change the course of events. At lunch, I asked for something different, but the waitress gave me the same dish as yesterday, as if I hadn't said anything. On the way back, I tried to take a different street, but my feet took me, almost of their own accord, to the usual route. I had dinner with my parents, watched TV. I went to bed. The glass of water was, again, on the opposite side of the bedside table. And the alarm clock rang at 6:30 am. Again.

Days merged into a repeating spiral. Every “tomorrow” was, in fact, the same “yesterday”. Anomalies, previously subtle, began to manifest themselves more aggressively. The glass of water on the bedside was just the beginning. In the third loop, the clock in the room, which always showed the correct time, was stopped at 3:17 am. In the bedroom, the photo of my family on the shelf had a slight scratch on my sister's face, which wasn't there before. On the fifth loop, the scratch deepened, and her eyes seemed to follow me. The colors on my bedroom walls seemed more faded, as if the life was being drained from them. The smell of coffee, once comforting, now had a metallic background, almost like blood. The familiar became grotesque.

People also changed. My mother, in her tenth loop, was still reading the newspaper, but her eyes were fixed on an invisible point, and she was muttering disjointed phrases about “time that doesn’t move forward.” My father, previously quiet, now laughed alone, a dry, joyless laugh. The college classmates had blank expressions, their movements robotic. I tried to talk to them, but their answers were always the same, repeated over and over, like a broken record. I once tried to hug a friend, and his skin felt cold and clammy, like that of a corpse. His eyes, for a moment, turned completely black, before returning to normal. They were no longer the people I knew. They were echoes, shadows of something that once existed.

The worst was what happened to me. At first, I tried to fight, scream, break the cycle. But each failed attempt left me more exhausted, more empty. Small marks began to appear on my body – scratches that wouldn't heal, bruises that appeared out of nowhere. My voice, once steady, was now a hoarse whisper. I looked in the mirror and saw something strange: my eyes were sunken, with dark circles under my eyes, and my hair seemed thinner. With each reset, I felt like a part of me was being ripped away, a memory, an emotion, a piece of my soul. I was becoming an echo too, a shadow in my own life. Reality disintegrated, and I with it. I was trapped, condemned to relive the same day, to witness the decay of the world and myself, without being able to do anything. The silent hum of routine had become the deafening scream of my own prison.

The apex came on the fifteenth loop. I was in college, in the same old class, when the professor, in the middle of a sentence about history, stopped. His previously empty eyes fixed on me with an intensity that made me freeze. A slow, sickly smile spread across his face, revealing teeth that seemed too long, too sharp. He didn't say anything, just pointed to the board. There, in a handwriting that was not his but that I recognized as my own, was written a single sentence: “You cannot escape your own echo.” Panic invaded me. I tried to run, but my legs wouldn't obey me. The other students, previously robotic, now stared at me with the same distorted smile as the teacher. Her eyes, all of them, were black, empty, like my sister's in the scratched photo. I was trapped. It wasn't the day that was repeating itself, it was me. I was the loop. Routine was not a prison, it was a mirror that reflected my own stagnation, my inability to change, to move forward. The veiled criticism was not about society, but about me. The horror was not external, but internal. I was the monster. I was the creepypasta.

And then, the alarm clock rang. 6:30 am. The gray light of dawn filtered through the cracks in the blinds. The smell of fresh coffee came from the kitchen. And my glass of water was, again, on the opposite side of the bedside table. I got up. There was no more panic, no more despair. Just a cold acceptance. I went down to the cafe. My mother was there, reading the newspaper. “Good morning, son,” she said. I smiled. A smile that wasn't mine, but fit perfectly on my now blank face. The silent hum of routine had become the melody of my existence. And I, the conductor, was ready to direct another day. Forever.

They called him the man who remembered every song.  
Not because he truly did memory is fickle, and time is cruel but because whenever someone needed one, he had it. Not just the lyrics, but the tune. Not just the tune, but the reason. And not just the reason, but the feeling. That was what made him rare.

He lived above a faded bar in a cobbled seaside town in Portugal. The locals said he’d been there forever, but nobody really knew. He arrived in town older already, a guitar slung over his shoulder, a suitcase full of notebooks and scraps of napkins and cassette tapes. Some thought he was running from something. Others thought he was circling back.

Every Friday evening, he’d sit on a rickety stool in the corner of the tavern, no name to it, just ""the place near the fig tree""  and he'd sing. Not loudly. Not for applause. Just enough for people to lean in. His voice was gravel and silk, the kind that clung to you long after you left.

He never played the same set twice.

One night, a woman, a tourist from Sweden, notebook in hand asked if she could record him. He smiled gently, as if touched and embarrassed all at once.

“I don’t mind,” he said. “But the songs aren’t mine. Not really.”

“Whose are they then?”

“They belong to the people I met. I’m just carrying them.”

She didn’t understand what he meant. But she hit record anyway.

That same night, a child wandered up to him after the last song, a delicate lullaby sung in a language no one quite recognized.

“What was that one?” the child asked.

He paused. “That was the first song I ever learned. My grandfather sang it to me when I couldn’t sleep. And now,” he said, tapping the boy gently on the forehead, “I’ve passed it to you.”

The boy beamed. “I’ll remember it forever.”

The man smiled. “You won’t. But it’ll stay with you anyway.”

That night, he walked home slower than usual, the sea breeze more tired than crisp. The moon hung low like a listening ear.

Inside his flat, shelves bowed under the weight of tapes and pages. He had spent years recording not just songs, but the stories behind them. The laughter in train stations, the quiet sobs of someone singing in a stairwell, the raucous chaos of wedding celebrations in languages he never learned but somehow understood. His journals weren’t chronological. They were emotional. Some pages were stained with wine, others with tears. Some had only single words. Others were overwritten to the point of illegibility.

He sat down at the window. The street below was empty. Somewhere, far off, a dog barked and was answered by silence.

He closed his eyes.

In his dreams, everyone was still alive.

Morning came slow. The kind of light that enters shyly, like it’s unsure of its welcome.

He boiled water. Made coffee the way he’d learned in Istanbul. Played a tape labeled *A.* No other markings.

The voice that came through the speaker was not his own. It was higher. Full of tremble and joy.

“Do you remember this one?” a voice giggled in Portuguese. “We sang it on the boat!”

He let it play through.

Later that afternoon, he sat again in his spot at the tavern. A woman named Elira came to visit. She was in her fifties and often brought him soup. Her father had once played clarinet alongside him in Naples, and though he’d died ten years prior, she said hearing the old man sing made her feel like her father had just stepped out for a cigarette.

“You look tired today,” she said.

“I’m not tired,” he replied. “Just remembering.”

She squeezed his hand. “You always are.”

That evening, he sang a song in Amharic. A young couple in the back gasped. The woman began to cry.

“He sang that at my sister’s wedding,” she whispered.

“No,” the man beside her said, confused. “You must be mistaken.”

“I’m not,” she insisted. “I remember.”

Later, when the tavern closed, and the lights flickered off one by one, he lingered.

The owner, a man named Rui, patted his shoulder. “Boa noite, velho.”

He nodded. “Boa noite.”

But he didn’t go home.

He walked instead to the cliffs. The waves below crashed like distant drums, old rhythms.

He looked out and whispered a name. The name disappeared before the wind could carry it.

Then, he sang. Just one verse.

No one heard it but the sea.

When they found his body the next morning, sitting peacefully under the fig tree, guitar beside him, they also found a note. It wasn’t addressed to anyone. It simply read:  
  
“A song is a moment that dares to stay. I tried to keep them all, but they were never mine. If you’re reading this, sing something. Loud or soft. Wrong notes are welcome. Just sing. For someone. For anyone. For the moment that just passed.”

He was buried with no known family. But the tavern was full that night. Someone sang. Then another. Then another.

No one quite knew who started it.

But by the end of the evening, they all remembered something they hadn’t known they’d forgotten.

**Act II – The Harmony**

He was in Tokyo the first time someone called him *a collector*.

Not in a condescending way, but with a kind of reverence. As if he were a keeper of endangered things, memories, melodies, glances across foreign platforms.

He had arrived two months prior, intending to stay three days.

But then he heard someone playing a warped upright piano in a smoke-filled jazz bar tucked behind an alley in Shinjuku. The pianist played like he had nowhere to be, nowhere else he’d rather go. The man ordered a drink, stayed the night, came back the next, and then every night after.

The pianist’s name was Kou. They never spoke much, Kou didn’t speak English and the man’s Japanese was clumsy, but they understood one another in notes and rests. One night, without warning, Kou nodded, and the man joined him onstage. They didn’t rehearse. Just started. And something happened — the crowd fell away, the room grew quiet, and a song was born that neither of them had ever played before, but both somehow already knew.

Kou called it “Between.”

He wrote it down in his journal with a note:  
  
“Tokyo, late spring. A song without a home.”

That’s how he catalogued his life. Not in calendar years, but in where he’d heard something for the first time. A lullaby in Budapest. A love song in Lagos. A war chant in Palestine that melted into a peace hymn in Morocco. He could trace the arc of his life in refrains.

He stayed in Tokyo for six months. Long enough to forget he was passing through. Long enough to fall in love with a woman named Yuna who sold old vinyl records and sang harmony without realizing it.

She sang as she worked, under her breath, like she was humming to the ghosts in the sleeves. He sang back once. She laughed. That night, she made them tea and showed him a box of half-finished lyrics she’d never shared with anyone.

“These are beautiful,” he said.

“They’re incomplete,” she replied.

He smiled. “Everything is.”

They spent a season together, making music and mistakes. She taught him to listen more carefully not just to melody, but to silence. “It tells you when the song is over,” she said once. “Most people don’t hear that part.”

He left after the first snow. Not because he stopped loving her, but because staying would’ve made him forget who he was someone who carried stories from place to place. He cried on the train. She waved until he was out of sight. He never wrote her again. She never sent her lyrics.

He sang her song once in Vienna. Just once. It made an old woman in the crowd clutch her chest and whisper, “*That was my mother’s wedding song.*”

He nodded, and didn’t correct her.

In Cape Town, he joined a choir - just for a week, he told himself.

The choir director, a woman named Mpho, didn’t care about his notebook or his tape recorder. “You’re not here to collect,” she said. “You’re here to contribute.”

It humbled him. For the first time in a while, he sang without recording it. Without trying to remember. He sang just to feel the harmony.

One day, a boy in the group, no older than twelve, asked him, “Why do you look sad when we sing?”

He thought for a moment. “Because it’s beautiful. And beautiful things always end.”

The boy didn’t understand, but that was okay. He would, someday.

He wandered through Spain, then northern Wales, then across to Iceland where he sang into the wind until the wind sang back.

He stopped chasing places. Started chasing people.

He once hitchhiked 300 kilometers just to meet a woman who was said to yodel lullabies in a language no one remembered. She was blind. When he asked her how she remembered the melodies, she laughed: “I don’t. I just trust the mountain to echo the ones that matter.”

He recorded her voice. Played it for children in Morocco who’d never heard yodeling. They laughed. Then listened. Then asked him to teach them.

So he did.

By now, his journals were heavier than his clothes. Some pages torn by time. Some ink smudged by rain or regret.

He stopped labeling everything. The tape recorder became more suggestion than necessity.

What he carried most was not the sound, but the feeling. That aching, golden hum you feel in your bones when a song opens something inside you you didn’t know had been shut.

He started noticing the pattern:  
He’d sing, they’d smile, then cry, then he’d leave.  
Each connection a flame.  
Each goodbye a long smoke trail.

He wrote in his journal:  
  
“What nobody tells you is that even joy is grief in disguise. We love because we must lose. We sing because it keeps the ache in tune.”

The last page of his journal from that chapter was written on a plane, leaving Senegal, headed nowhere specific.

It simply said:  
  
“I think the songs are starting to remember me.”

**Act I – The First Note**

He was nine the first time he heard someone sing like the world depended on it.

It was his grandfather.  
  
A tall man with the kind of voice that wrapped around you like a winter coat, worn, but reliable. He sang in the kitchen while making coffee, humming through the scrape of spoons and the click of the kettle. He sang while fixing the car, while reading the paper, while shaving. But it wasn’t until that one night, the night of the power cut, that the boy *heard* it.

The house went dark with the storm.  
The wind howled like it had something to say.

He was scared. He cried. And then, from the end of the hallway,  came his grandfather’s voice.  
  
“Lay your head down, little flame,  
Let the wind sing you a name…”

The song had no end, just a slow fade, like the world quieting down. It wasn’t in any language he recognized, just gentle syllables shaped to soothe.

After that, he asked to hear it again. And again. Until he began to sing it himself, quietly, in the back seat of the car, at school during rainy days, in his sleep.

No one else in the family sang. His parents were busy. He understood that even then,  their love was practical, not poetic. But his grandfather listened. Gave him a hand-me-down cassette recorder. Said, “Every life has a soundtrack. Might as well start catching yours now.”

He began recording everything: birdsong, laughter, buses sighing at stops, the shuffling of feet at the local market. At twelve, he sang in public for the first time at a funeral. A neighbor had passed, and someone needed to fill the silence. He stepped forward before his body had quite caught up with his mind.

He sang the lullaby.  
The room went still.  
People cried. He didn’t understand why, not really. But he felt something unlock.

His grandfather died two years later.

The funeral was quiet. No songs. His family thought it unnecessary. “He wouldn’t have wanted a fuss,” they said.

But he knew better.  
He stood at the back, didn’t say a word. But as the casket was lowered, he pressed *record* and quietly hummed that same melody. One last time. Just for him.

Later that night, he went into his grandfather’s workshop. The old tape deck was still there. Dust-covered, but working. He pressed play.

The song played back, tinny but true. And after it ended, silence. Not empty, but full of presence.

He wrote in his journal - the first entry:  
  
“This is how I will remember him.  
This is how I will remember anything.  
Through the echo.”

At sixteen, he left home.  
Took a bus out of the county with a guitar, a knapsack, and three notebooks. Nobody stopped him. He wasn’t running away not exactly. He just knew that the world had more songs in it, and somehow, they were meant for him.

He stayed in hostels. Shared beds with roaches and ceiling drips. He was scared most nights. Cold. Unsure. But when he sang, strangers smiled. Bought him soup. Asked where he was from.

He never gave the same answer twice.

One night in Marseille, a woman gave him a harmonica. Another night in Prague, a man slipped a napkin into his case it had a single line written on it:  
  
“Keep chasing the song. It’s chasing you too.”

He did.

By the time he was twenty, he had a hundred voices in his head. And none of them felt like noise. Each one was a ghost with a name. A chorus of the life he was stitching together. No one knew him, not really. But they sang with him. They let him in for a verse.

He wrote another line in his journal:  
  
“Love isn’t just for people. I think you can love a moment, too.  
And moments are always leaving.  
So maybe grief is what life is made of, but softened by melody.”

And so it began.

The long, reverse unraveling.

From youth to middle age to old age.  
From first note to final refrain.

From someone learning to sing - to someone *being* the song.

If you ever meet someone who knows just the right song to sing - not the one *you* know, but the one *you feel* \- hold on for a moment.  
Because maybe, just maybe, you’ve met him.

I started waking up at 4AM, expecting instant millionaire results. Instead, I was just… awake. At 4AM. Tired. Cold. Feeling like an idiot.

1l5etth,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1l5etth/you_will_be_okay/,YOU WILL BE OKAY.,"Hey guys, I haven’t been on this subreddit in forever. But I decided to come back to upload this, because it’s something I was looking for when I was deep into my issues almost a year ago. 

I’m 18F, and this all started for me in high school. When I was 17, I took an edible, and had my first panic attack. I was fine for a month or so, then noticed my depression getting worse, and my mental quickly slipped. I began having panic attacks, becoming extremely anxious and suicidal, and was losing touch with reality (if this sounds like you, trying to figure out if it was weed, YOU ARE SAFE. Keep reading.) 

I only kept devolving. I don’t remember the end of my senior year of high school. I was depressed, suicidal, had panic attacks everyday, could barely get out of bed. I wanted to end my life. Fast forward a year, and I will be honest- I am not “healed.” But I am BETTER, and living a life I couldn’t have imagined a year ago. And I have faith it will get better. Here’s how I approached it: 

1) GET OFF REDDIT. Make this the last post you read. Even now, as I started reading, I was falling into the anxious rabbit hole. This is NOT GOOD FOR YOU. Stop following everyone with bad stories and stop convincing yourself this is forever. It’s not. The people who are fine LEAVE this subreddit and stop posting (like me), so you will always see more bad than good. 

2) Take care of yourself. Eat foods that are good for you. Shower everyday. Exercise. Go out with friends. Even if it makes you anxious, even if you feel NOTHING, do it anyway. A year ago, I couldn’t go outside without spiraling. Now I walk outside all the time. 

2.5) Stop drinking caffeine, or eating lots of sugar. Cut out the coffee and the energy drinks (at least for now!) These things make it worse. As a former matcha girl it really sucks but you have to look out for your self. 

3) GET HELP. See a therapist, start the meds, talk to your friends. Do not isolate yourself !!! Most of my close friends are very intimately aware of my issues, as well as my family. This way you will have a support system. 

4) Stimulate your brain. Read, write, talk, learn! You stil can !! That is a blessing. When I was at my worst, all I would do was sleep and read to stay out of my head. WHATEVER IT TAKES. 

5) BELIEVE you will get better. If you say- I will be like this for the rest of my life THEN YOU WILL. Your mental is stronger than you think. I often get placebo anxiety from things that I imagine are triggers! DON’T LET IT TAKE OVER. 

There was a point in my life where I would just lay in bed and cry and mourn the life I used to have. And while I still have panic attacks and still have issues, I can do so many things!!! I travel, I go to parties, I hang out with friends, I do so many things I never thought I would do again. So PLEASE don’t give up, PLEASE keep trying. You will only get better over time if you dedicate yourself to it. I know I will continue to heal. If you have any questions, feel free to DM me or put them in the comments, I will answer as I can. 

You are strong, you are safe. This is reality, and it is not fake. You are real, and you are important. Things will get better, and you are so loved. 

Best. xx

1l5esai,https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLaptops/comments/1l5esai/laptop_recommendation_for_a_total_newbie/,laptop recommendation for a total newbie!!,"hi! i am totally new to the world of gaming and computers in general, and i’m looking for some recommendations on a gaming laptop that would suit my needs. this is going to be a bit long winded, since i have some specifics that i would like in my new device, so thank you in advance!

i have been a mac laptop user since i started using computers, so i’m totally unfamiliar with this territory. last black friday, i purchased the HP Victus 16.1, with an amd ryzen 7-8845HS processor, 16gb ram, LED display, nvidia geforce rtx 4070 graphics card, and 512 gb storage. i pretty much have no idea what this means, and if you guys had any resources to start learning i would appreciate those too! i mainly bought it because the deal was advertised on many sites as “a steal,” and i’m looking to get more into gaming.

i hated the physical laptop so much that i never really used it, and came to the realization 2 weeks ago that it isn’t worth keeping if i wasn’t using it at all. i’m going to sell it, but i’ll need a new one that i like better, which is why i need your help! luckily, i now know what i don’t like, which is helpful.

My biggest problems with the laptop I purchased and hated were the keyboard and the screen brightness. I know it’s a tall order, but I really like to write, and number pads just aren’t comfortable when I type. I have heard smaller laptops may be the solution, which I am fine with. I also greatly disliked how dim the screen was, especially in the daytime.

My other dislikes were how godawful the speakers and mic were, how clunky and plasticky it was, the fans being loud, the laptop warming quickly, and the battery life being comically short. however, i have heard these are part in parcel with a gaming laptop, and so i’m willing to bend on these.

I know what you may think— with all these complaints, why do i not just get a desktop with components i prefer? the reason is that i have to travel very often, and the laptop has to be versatile enough to be my primary writing device— and i am most productive when writing in a public space like a coffee shop or library.

when i went to best buy and told them what i was looking for, they recommended me these two at the price point i was looking at:

ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 14” OLED, with amd ryzen 9 8945HS processor, 16gb ram, nvidia geforce rtx 4060 graphics card, 1tb storage

HP OMEN Transcend 14” OLED, with intel core ultra 7-155H processor, 16gb ram, nvidia geforce rtx 4060 graphics card, 1tb storage

For reference, the beefiest games i’m looking to play are modded minecraft, baldur’s gate 3, and cyberpunk 2077. i’m also notorious for having a browser, spotify, and discord up at the same time. My budget ideally is around 1500, with the hope that during major sales it will drop to 1200 or so.

thank you guys so much in advance for your help! i know this is a tall order and a lot to read, so any help is greatly appreciated <3

TLDR;

Budget & Currency: around $1500 USD

Country: USA 

Screen Size Preference: no preference

Resolution & Refresh Rate: I prefer a brighter screen because I like to work in the daytime! No other preference

Preferred GPU: best for my budget!

CPU Preference: no preference

RAM & Storage Needs: unsure! enough to play beefy games like baldur’s gate 3 and modded minecraft. willing to commit to external storage.

Battery Life Requirement: no preference!

Specific Features Needed: no number pad on keyboard

Games You Play & Settings: modded minecraft, baldur’s gate 3, and cyberpunk 2077 would be the beefiest ones.

Other Uses: writing, primarily, so i’d like to type comfortably. i also often stream movies online with discord.

Brands to Avoid: no preference! i’m open",1,1749280007.0,GamingLaptops,1,1.0,False
1l5es0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1l5es0m/whats_the_point_of_even_trying_to_date_anymore/,What’s the point of even trying to date anymore,"Forgive me while I vent my frustrations for a second.

I’ve just about given up on dating as a whole or even trying, and i understand these are common frustrations but it’s still frustrating nonetheless.

So where to begin, I guess we can start with how it’s next to impossible to meet anyone. I’m in a 3rd place desert, there’s no cafe’s or coffee shops, no sports, no nothing for at least an hour radius around where I live. I have a very small friend group so I can’t date in that or date friends of friends as well tbh there aren’t that many. My job isn’t one that’s a good idea to date in, granted no job is really a good place to look for dates but you get what I mean. There’s the gym and grocery stores but it seems most people don’t want to be approached in those environments. Finally despite having a decent amount of people on dating app around me surprisingly enough, I just don’t get that many matches, maybe 5 a month max, and of those most just don’t work out for various reasons.

The few dates I have been on I thought went great but haven’t gone anywhere. That’s assuming the person I’m talking to doesn’t just randomly go from seeming very interested to ghosting me right before or after the first date.

Ik I’m not perfect but I don’t think I’d be a bad partner. I’ve got a good job, decent friends and hobbies, looks wise I’m nothing special but I don’t think I’m ugly, I could lose some weight but I am working on that. Personality wise I really know I could use some work, but I give my all to every relationship I’ve been in but still no luck.

I’m just at a loss, I’m happy single I am don’t get me wrong. But I want someone to share my life with to have fun and go on adventures and be happy together. But it seems like it’s just not gonna happen, and after every failed relationship attempt I just can’t help but feel that maybe it’s me that’s the problem, and you know maybe it is. I keep holding out hope but after 22years of the closest thing to a real relationship being a date or two I’m just starting to give up hope.

Anyway, that’s the end of my venting, I just really needed to actually say these things out loud or type them to finally get them off my mind.",1,1749279974.0,venting,0,1.0,False

Frankly, I normally see these numbers in women ten or fifteen years your senior. What?” I murmur, not believing my ears. I’ve been trying to get pregnant for.....","**Chapter 1 - Betray**

I’m sorry Ella.” My physician says gently. “I’m afraid you have very few viable eggs remaining. Frankly, I normally see these numbers in women ten or fifteen years your senior. What?” I murmur, not believing my ears. I’ve been trying to get pregnant for years. I’m only 30, I should have plenty of eggs left. In terms of fertility, you have very little time left.” She continues. “If you want to conceive, you need to do so before your next cycle begins. My next cycle?” I repeat, my mouth hanging open in shock. I love kids more than anything, and though it might not be everyone’s ambition, I want nothing more than to be a mother. I have to get home and tell my boyfriend this news, and there’s not a moment to waste. I make it home in record time, bursting through the door and opening my mouth to call for Mike, but stopping dead in my tracks. As soon as I walk inside I see a pair of high heels and a handbag by the door – neither of which belong to me. I cock my ears towards the bedroom, and my stomach churns when I hear the unmistakable sound of moaning, accompanied by a steady thump thump thump, as the bed collides with the wall. Worse even than realizing that Mike is clearly in there with another woman, is realizing who he’s with. I know that handbag, and I know those shoes – they belong to my best friend, Kate. Fuck, Ella is so stupid.” Mike laughs, “can you believe she actually expects me to have a baby with her? Kate snorts, “she’s delusional. I don’t know how you put up with her for so long in the first place. If she wasn’t so beautiful I never would have given her the time of day.” Mike scoffs. “Thankfully daily doses of plan B kept her from ever conceiving. The morning after pill?” Kate asks, “how did you manage to give it to her without her realizing?”  
  
“I put it in her morning coffee.” Mike chortles, sounding far too proud of himself.   
  
My vision goes completely red as everything finally falls into place. Suddenly it’s clear why I’ve never been able to get pregnant, despite having unprotected sex multiple times a week for years. It’s even clear how I could have the eggs of a 45-year-old, if my despicable partner has been secretly feeding me emergency contraceptives every day – there’s no telling what other damage that might have done to my reproductive system.   
  
Before I can think better of it, I pull the smoke alarm on the wall, wanting to frighten and punish the pair in the bedroom so fiercely that I fear I might attack them when they emerge. Water immediately sprays down from the sprinkler system mounted to the ceiling as a shrill siren fills the air, and I hear Mike and Kate cry out in surprise.   
  
A few moments later they come rushing out of the bedroom, stopping in their tracks when they see me looming in the doorway. Mike’s eyes go comically wide, “What are you doing home so early?” The snake has the nerve to sound affronted that I surprised him, when he’s the one who’s been sneaking around behind my back for God knows how long. He seems to realize how suspicious it looks that he and Kate are standing there in their underwear and quickly adds, “Kate came to see me so we could plan a surprise for your birthday, but then we spilled coffee all over our clothes so we had to change.”  
  
Fire blazes in my veins, he must truly believe I’m an idiot if he expects me to buy such a feeble excuse.   
  
It’s a testament to their horrifically low opinion of me that they buy my act, and I vow to get my revenge one way or another. I can’t believe I wasted so many years – my best years – on this scumbag. And now he may have cost me my future too. As soon as the thought enters my head, I know I can’t afford to waste another moment on Mike, I have more important things to take care of.   
  
I make my excuses and rush across town for the second time that afternoon, running to the comforting arms of my surrogate sister, Cora. Not only did we grow up together in the orphanage, but she became an OBGYN and now works for the most exclusive sperm bank in the city. I’ve never gone to her before because I always imagined Mike and I would eventually conceive the natural way, but that clearly isn’t an option anymore.   
  
Even if I could find a man willing to have a baby with me in time, I’m not eager to trust anyone after Mike’s betrayal. I’m going to have to do this on my own, and I know Cora can help me. I don’t have much money, but I have enough savings to pay for the insemination, especially since I basically have one shot and one shot only.   
  
When I arrive, all my plans to lay out my situation for Cora clearly and concisely go out the window, because the moment I see my sister I fall to pieces. She hugs and kisses me until my tears subside, slowly extracting the story from me piece by piece. When she hears about Mike and Kate she swears up a storm, but that’s nothing compared to her reaction when I explain about my fertility.   
  
“That little shit! I’ll kill him!” She fumes, studying me with a worried expression. “Ella, if your doctor was right this means you only have one chance to conceive.”  
  
“I know.” I sniffle. “And if this is going to be my only baby, I don’t want to take any chances. I want the best donor we can find.”  
  
“Don’t you worry about that.” Cora assures me, “We’ve got donations from actors, models, scientists – it’s only the creme de la creme here.” She glances at the door and lowers her voice. “You didn’t hear it from me, but even Dominic Sinclair sent his samples here for testing.”  
  
“Dominic Sinclair? I repeat, “the billionaire?” I’ve seen the man around town, but we don’t exactly run in the same circles. He lives in the same neighborhood as my wealthy employer and often says hello to the children I nanny, but he’s always surrounded by bodyguards and is so intimidating I get goosebumps just thinking about him.    
  
“Oh my god!.” Cora slaps her hand over her mouth. “I wasn’t supposed to tell you that! I don’t know what I was thinking. Apparently he’s no stranger to fertility issues himself, and he trusted us to handle his swimmers over every other lab in the country. I’ve got his sperm in the other room at this very moment.” She frets, “But Ella you can’t tell anyone, you have to promise me.”  
  
“Of course!” I agree immediately. “I know how important confidentiality is here.”  
  
“Thank you,” Cora breathes. “Now, I’m going to give you a dossier of our clients so you can pick a donor, and once you’ve chosen we’ll get you knocked up before you can even blink.”   
  
It’s not an easy decision, but eventually I choose a handsome surgeon whose photo practically makes me swoon. Cora leaves the room only long enough to prepare the sample, and though she looks a bit flustered when she returns, she quickly and professionally completes the insemination, holding my hand when the procedure is finished. “It’s all take care of now, Ella.” She promises, “You can come back in ten days to see if it worked.”  
  
Ten days. I think dazedly. Ten days to decide my entire future.  
  
If only I’d known that by the time those ten days were up, my future would no longer belong to me – but to Dominic Sinclair himself. 



**Chapter 2 - Be Fired**



Ella  
  
Six days to go. I think, staring at the date circled on my calendar. Six days until I find out if my dreams are finally going to come true… or if I have to figure out an entirely different plan for my life.   
  
I’ve thought about nothing else since Cora inseminated me last week, I’m so anxious to find out if I’m pregnant I haven’t even begun to process Mike’s betrayal.   
  
I’m trying to keep a level head, yet I can’t help but imagine my future with this new baby. Try as I might, I catch myself daydreaming about it constantly. I even find myself humming as I get ready for work in the morning.   
  
When I arrive at my employer’s estate in the most exclusive neighborhood in Moon Valley – which basically makes it the most exclusive neighborhood in the world, since Moon Valley is one of the most expensive cities on the planet – I’m immediately greeted by two little voices shouting my name in excitement. “Ella!”  
  
The next thing I know, 3-year-old Millie is hugging my legs while her older brother, Jake, wraps his arms around my middle. “Good morning love puddles!” I exclaim, returning their hugs. “Are you ready for the museum?”  
  
“Yeah!” They cheer, racing out the door without even stopping to put on coats. It takes a bit of wrangling to get them back inside and bundled up for the cold winter day, but before long we set out into the snow.  
  
Jake races ahead of Millie and I, impatient to get to the science museum and not seeming to notice that his sister’s tiny legs simply don’t move that fast. Chuckling, I lift Millie into my arms and settle her on my hip. “Goodness, you’re getting too big for this, munchkin.”  
  
“Nuh-uh,” Millie grins, “You’re justs too little.”   
  
She might have a point. At five foot one, I don’t exactly have the kind of build suited to heavy lifting. I’m in great shape, but I’ve never been particularly strong. “Smarty pants.” I tease, laughing with the little girl.   
  
When I look back towards Jake, I realize he’s stopped a few feet ahead of us. My heart skips a beat when I realize why. We’re in front of the Sinclair mansion, and its owner is currently standing in the middle of the sidewalk, his gaze searing  me like a firebrand as I approach with Millie. Dominic Sinclair is just about the most handsome man I’ve ever seen, but he’s also one of the most terrifying.   
  
With dark hair and piercing green eyes, chiseled features and a body so muscular I could swoon, it doesn’t seem fair he gets to look so good and also be so rich. If I didn’t know better I might think it was his wealth or imposing height that makes him so intimidating, after all he’s at least six foot four, which means he towers over me and everyone else around him. However it’s neither of those things, there’s simply an indefinable quality about the man that I can’t put my finger on, one which screams danger. He gives off this energy that’s so raw and animalistic one forgets there’s anyone else in the room.   
  
Taking a steadying breath, I close the distance between us so Millie can say hello. When she greets him, Dominic drags his attention from me and offers her a smile so genuine that it tugs at my heartstrings. As I watch him talk to my two young charges, I remember what Cora told me about his infertility struggles. He clearly loves children, and I feel a wave of empathy for him. If anyone knows what it’s like to yearn for a family of their own, it’s me.   
  
Jake is currently showing Dominic his new toy airplane, pulling the matchbox model from his pocket and demonstrating how far it can fly. With a great heave, he sends the toy gliding through the air, only to land in the middle of the street. Before any of us can say a word, Jake races after it, right into the busy road.  
  
“Jake no, be careful!” I cry, watching him dart out into the path of an oncoming car but feeling frozen by my fear. Before I can contemplate putting Millie down to go after him, a blur of movement whirrs past my vision. I’ve never seen anyone move so fast in my life. Dominic became little more than a hazy outline of himself, chasing after Jake and pulling him out of the way just before the car slams into them. The vehicle’s tires are still screeching when Dominic sets Jake down beside me, his expression suddenly very stern.   
  
“That was very dangerous.” He scolds gently. “You should never go into the street without looking both ways first.”  
  
Jake hangs his head. “I’m sorry, I didn’t want my plane to get runned over.”   
  
“You are a million times more important than a toy.” Dominic tells him firmly, “and you scared your nanny half to death.”  
  
“I’m sorry, Ella.” Jake sniffles, looking up at me with wide eyes.   
  
“I know sweetheart, just don’t ever do that again.” I breathe, cuddling him against my side. “Thank you so much.” I say to Dominic, feeling more grateful than I can express. “I have no idea how you moved so fast! It was like something out of a superhero film.”  
  
“Must have been the adrenaline.” Dominic shrugs, giving Millie another smile before taking his leave. “Enjoy the rest of your day, and stay out of the road young man!”  
  
“Yes sir!” Jake calls after him, pocketing his airplane. “I really am sorry.” He adds to me.   
  
“It’s forgotten.” I tell him softly, though I take his hand so that he can’t run off again.   
  
“It all happened so fast.” I tell Cora later that night. “I mean the more I think about it, the more amazing it seems. One moment he was there, and the next he was gone. It was like magic.”  
  
“Thank goodness Jake is alright.” She replies, but rather than looking relieved, her face is twisted into a deep grimace.  
  
Studying my sister’s expression, I realize her grim demeanor is not just about Jake’s near miss. Something else is wrong, and I actually feel guilty for not noticing sooner. “Is everything okay?”  
  
Cora frowns, “Not really. But you’ve got so much going on right now, it’s not important.”  
  
“Cora, don’t be ridiculous.” I admonish. “What’s going on?”  
  
“Well, speaking of Dominic Sinclair,” She begins cryptically, “you know that sperm he sent to us for testing?”  
  
“Yeah,” I confirm, wondering where on earth this was going.   
  
“It’s gone missing… and I’m the last person who saw it, not to mention it was in my custody.” She explains, her voice becoming thick with emotion. “Ella, I think… I think I’m going to be fired. And if there’s an investigation I could lose my medical  license.”  
  
“What?” I exclaim. “What do you mean it’s missing? A vial of sperm can’t just get up and walk away.”  
  
“I know, I think someone had to steal it, but there’s no way of knowing who’s responsible. And it looks like I’m going to have to take the blame.” She shares, her eyes shining with tears.   
  
“Cora, I can’t believe you didn’t tell me this sooner!” I lament, “They can’t fire you, it isn’t fair.”  
  
“You don’t understand, Dominic is one of our biggest donors.” Cora explains. “And he’s furious, he basically wants my head on a platter.”  
  
A week ago I might have believed there was no hope for Cora, but seeing how kind and understanding Dominic was with the kids today makes me wonder if he could really be so heartless. Surely if he understood that Cora would never be so irresponsible he’d show some leniency? I have to try and help her, I would do anything for my sister – even begging a ruthless billionaire for mercy.



**Chapter 3 - Request**

Three days to go.  
  
I repeat these words to myself as I walk down the street, still preoccupied with my possible pregnancy, even as I prepare to go to bat for my sister. In some ways it's a coping mechanism: I’m about to beg Dominic Sinclair to save Cora’s job, and I need a comforting thought to help me get through this.   
  
His bodyguards see me first, and I can see their mouths moving as they watch me move closer, no doubt notifying him of my presence. Approaching nervously behind Dominic, I wonder for the hundredth time if this is a mistake. Who am I to ask a favor from one of the most powerful men on the planet? Shaking myself, I tell the little voice in the back of my mind to shut up – this is for Cora. I might not be brave for myself, but I can be brave for her.   
  
“Mr. Sinclair?” I ask hesitantly, feeling my heart pound violently against my ribcage.    
  
He turns around and gazes imperiously down at me. “Yes?”  
  
“I’m Ella Reina, I nanny for Jake and Millie Graves.” I begin, gnawing on my lower lip.   
  
His dark eyes catch on my mouth, and suddenly I feel like a frightened rabbit in front of a hungry wolf. “I know who you are, Ella.” The sound of my name on his lips sends a shiver down my spine. He speaks the familiar syllables with so much purpose, as if they truly mean something to him.  
  
“Oh… well, I don’t mean to be impertinent, but I’m friends with Dr Cora Daniels…”As soon as I say her name, his expression closes off, and some unidentified emotion flashes in his eyes.   
  
“She told me she’s in trouble at work, and I know you’re one of the bank’s donors.” I improvise. “I don’t know what Cora is being accused of, but I’m sure she’s innocent. She takes her job incredibly seriously, and she would never do anything to risk her career.”  
  
“And what do you expect me to do about it?” Dominic asks ominously. I can tell he doesn’t believe my weak story, his body language has changed completely, and I can feel his rising anger vibrating in the air around us.   
  
“I just thought… I hoped that if you had any sway there, you might be able to put in a good word for her.” I finish, feeling color flood my cheeks. I’m both ashamed of myself for such a feeble attempt, but unsure how else to handle such a delicate topic. The last thing I want is to get Cora in even more trouble than before.   
  
Dominic’s jaw ticks as he watches me, and the voice in the back of my head urges me to run for it. “From what I’ve heard, your friend made a very serious mistake, and the consequences have been more than appropriate. The best thing she can do now is take responsibility for her mistakes, not sending you to do her dirty work for her.”  
  
“I – she didn’t, she doesn’t even know I’m here! I swear.” I plead.   
  
“I’ve said all I’m going to say on this matter.” Dominic declares, turning away from me and striding into his house. The door slams shut behind him, and I’m left with his various bodyguards.   
  
“You need to leave now, miss.” One of the men announces sharply.   
  
“I can’t.” I moan, “he has to understand, she’s going to lose everything!”   
  
“We’re not going to ask you again.” A second guard growls, a clear threat in his words.   
  
“Please, she’s innocent.” I beg, “you have to –” before I can say anything more, the men grab me by the arms and begin trying to lead me off the property. Feeling truly desperate, I dig in my heels, deciding that my dignity is worth Cora’s entire future. “I’m begging you, if I could just talk to Mr. Sinclair.”   
  
“You’ve already talked to him.” The first guard grumbles, “and frankly you’re lucky he was as generous to you as he was. Your friend clearly told you things she shouldn’t.”  
  
The next thing I know, they’ve thrown me off the property and onto the sidewalk so forcefully that I lose my balance, tumbling to the ground as tears spark in my eyes. The iron gates slam shut behind me, and I have no choice but to slink off before I can embarrass myself further.   
  
Of course, this was only the beginning of my misfortune. When I arrived at work the next day, I found that my keys no longer fit the locks on the front door. I knocked, overwhelmed with confusion, and a few minutes later the door swung open to reveal Jake and Millie’s furious mother.   
  
“My keys aren’t working.” I tell her, wondering why she’s glaring at me so fiercely.  
  
“They’re not meant to.” She answers coldly, “as of yesterday afternoon, your services were no longer required.”  
  
“I… you’re firing me?” I squeak, not believing my ears. “Why?”  
  
“We got a call from the neighbors.” She explains haughtily, “apparently you let Jake run into the road the other day where he was almost hit by a car! And then yesterday you were seen making a fool of yourself at Dominic Sinclair’s home – they said his bodyguards had to drag you off the grounds like a common criminal.”  
  
“That isn’t fair, that isn’t what happened!” I plead. “Jake through his toy into the road and ran after it, I didn’t let it happen, and what happened with Mr. Sinclair was a misunderstanding.”  
  
“I don’t want to hear it.” She hisses. “Now leave before I call the police.”  
  
“Please, can’t I at least say goodbye to the kids?” I request, praying she’ll grant me this one kindness.  
  
“I’m dialing.” She tells me simply, pulling her cell phone from her pocket.   
  
“No!” I raise my palms in supplication, “It’s okay, I’ll go.”  
  
For the second time this week, I find myself shamefully retreating through this opulent neighborhood with tears streaming down my face. What hurts even worse than losing my job is the fact I didn't get to explain the situation to Jake and Millie, or see them one last time. I’m sure their mother will tell them horrible things about me, despite the fact that I’ve been lovingly raising for them for the last two years.  
  
I know Dominic Sinclair is responsible for this. I don’t believe my ex-boss’s story about the neighbors for one moment. He clearly wanted to punish me, just like he’s having Cora punished. A rush of fury takes hold of me, and suddenly I wish I could punish him somehow. It’s not like me to be so vindictive, but right now it truly feels like my entire life is falling apart, and it’s partly his fault.   
  
I spent all my money on the insemination, and without a job I have almost nothing. How am I ever going to afford to have a baby now? I guarantee I’m not going to get a good reference from Jake and Millie’s mother.   
  
As if things weren’t already bad enough, when I return home I find a stack of bills in the mailbox and I don’t even recognize half the senders. I open them one by one, feeling my confusion and disbelief grow by the minute.  
  
As I look at the stores on the breakdown of charges, my suspicion grows: they’re all Mike’s favorite places. Is it possible he did this behind my back? That he’s been hiding the bills from me for months… or years? I know he’ll deny it if I confront him, which leaves me only one option.

I still remember stepping off that plane at JFK, my heart pounding with the kind of excitement you get when childhood dreams suddenly become reality. For years, I'd watched America unfold on movie screens – those towering Manhattan skyscrapers, the Golden Gate Bridge emerging from San Francisco fog, the vast expanse of the Grand Canyon. But nothing, and I mean *nothing*, prepares you for the sensory overload of experiencing these iconic places in person.

Here's the thing about planning your **first trip to the USA** – it's both thrilling and completely overwhelming. With 50 states spanning nearly 4 million square miles, where do you even begin? The country offers everything from neon-lit cities that never sleep to pristine wilderness where you can hear your own heartbeat. You've got jazz clubs in New Orleans, Hollywood glamour in Los Angeles, political powerhouses in Washington D.C., and natural wonders that'll make you question everything you thought you knew about this planet.

After multiple cross-country adventures and countless conversations with fellow first-time visitors, I've curated this guide to help you navigate the **best places to visit in USA for first time** travelers. These aren't just tourist traps – they're the experiences that define the American spirit and will leave you planning your next trip before you've even left.

# East Coast Classics: Where American Dreams Take Shape

# New York City: The Heartbeat of America

Let me tell you about my first morning in Manhattan. I grabbed a coffee from a corner deli (the guy behind the counter had the thickest Brooklyn accent I'd ever heard), and walked into Central Park just as the sun was casting golden rays through the autumn leaves. The contrast hit me immediately – this peaceful oasis surrounded by the most intense urban energy on the planet.

**Times Square at night** is something you have to experience, even if locals roll their eyes at it. Yes, it's crowded and yes, it's touristy, but there's something magical about standing in the crossroads of the world with giant screens flashing above you and the energy of eight million people flowing around you like a river. The sounds alone – honking taxis, street musicians, snippets of conversation in dozens of languages – create this symphony that's uniquely New York.

The **Statue of Liberty** isn't just about taking that classic photo (though you absolutely should). Taking the ferry to Liberty Island on a crisp morning, watching the Manhattan skyline grow smaller as Lady Liberty grows larger, you start to understand what this symbol meant to millions of immigrants arriving here with nothing but hope and determination.

Pro tip: Book your **Empire State Building** tickets for sunset. Watching the city transition from golden hour to its famous twinkling night lights while you're suspended 86 floors above it all – that's an experience that'll stick with you forever.

# Washington D.C.: Power, History, and Free Museums

Washington D.C. surprised me in the best possible way. I'd expected stuffy government buildings and tourist crowds, but what I found was this incredibly walkable city where you can literally touch American history. The **National Mall** stretches like a green carpet between the Capitol Building and the Lincoln Memorial, and every step tells a story.

Here's what nobody tells you about the **Smithsonian museums** – they're completely free, and you could spend weeks exploring them. I got completely lost in the National Museum of Natural History for an entire afternoon, moving from dinosaur fossils to Hope Diamond to the butterfly pavilion. The National Air and Space Museum will make you feel like a kid again, especially when you're standing next to the actual Apollo 11 command module.

The **Lincoln Memorial** at sunset is something special. Standing there, reading those immortal words carved in stone while the reflecting pool mirrors the Washington Monument – you feel the weight of history and the promise of the future all at once.

# West Coast Wonders: Sun, Stars, and Natural Majesty

# San Francisco: Golden Gates and Rolling Hills

San Francisco has this romantic, almost European quality that sets it apart from any other American city. My first cable car ride down those famous hills was like being on the world's most scenic roller coaster, with Victorian houses painted in pastels whizzing by and glimpses of the bay sparkling between buildings.

The **Golden Gate Bridge** is Instagram famous for good reason, but experiencing it in person adds layers no photograph can capture. I walked across it on a foggy morning when the towers disappeared into white mist, feeling like I was walking into a cloud. The sound of the wind through the cables, the salt spray from the bay below, the sight of Alcatraz Island emerging from the fog – it's poetry in engineering form.

**Fisherman's Wharf** might seem touristy, but don't skip it. The sea lions basking on Pier 39 are hilarious to watch, and the clam chowder served in sourdough bread bowls is a San Francisco tradition worth embracing. Plus, the ferry rides to **Alcatraz** depart from here, and trust me, that audio tour narrated by former inmates is absolutely gripping.

# Los Angeles: Hollywood Dreams and Beach Vibes

Los Angeles sprawls like no other city in America, and that's part of its charm. You'll need a car (or ride-shares) to really experience it, but the journey between neighborhoods is half the adventure. Driving down **Sunset Boulevard** for the first time, palm trees swaying overhead and the Hollywood Hills rising to your right, you can't help but feel like you're in a movie.

The **Hollywood Walk of Fame** might seem cheesy, but there's something genuinely moving about seeing your favorite actors' names immortalized in star-shaped plaques on the sidewalk. The nearby **TCL Chinese Theatre** with its famous handprints and footprints in concrete tells the story of American entertainment like nowhere else.

But here's what surprised me most about LA – the beaches. **Santa Monica Pier** with its solar-powered Ferris wheel and classic boardwalk games feels like stepping into an American postcard. The **Getty Center**, perched high in the hills, offers incredible art collections and even better views of the sprawling city below.

And yes, you absolutely must try **In-N-Out Burger**. Order it ""Animal Style"" and taste what West Coast burger dreams are made of.

# Natural Marvels That Define America

# Grand Canyon: Humbling Vastness

No amount of photos or descriptions can prepare you for your first glimpse of the **Grand Canyon**. I arrived at the South Rim just before sunrise, coffee in hand, expecting to be impressed. What I wasn't expecting was to be rendered completely speechless. The canyon doesn't just look big – it looks impossible, like someone took a knife to the earth and carved out a masterpiece that spans geological eras.

Standing at **Mather Point** as the sun rises and slowly illuminates layer after layer of red rock, you understand why Native Americans considered this a sacred place. The colors shift from deep purple shadows to brilliant oranges and reds, and you realize you're looking at millions of years of earth's history laid bare.

If you're feeling adventurous, the **helicopter tours** offer a perspective that hiking simply can't match. Flying down into the canyon itself, following the Colorado River's path, you appreciate both the raw power of water over time and the incredible vastness of this natural wonder.

# Yellowstone: America's Wilderness Playground

**Yellowstone** in spring is like watching the earth wake up. I'll never forget my first encounter with **Old Faithful** – not just the geyser itself, but the anticipation. Sitting on those wooden benches with families from around the world, all of us watching the ground and waiting for the earth to literally blow its top. When it happens, shooting 150 feet into the air with a roar you can feel in your chest, everyone erupts in applause like we're at a concert.

The **Grand Prismatic Spring** looks like something from another planet – this massive hot spring with rings of brilliant colors created by heat-loving bacteria. Walking around it on the boardwalks, breathing in the sulfur-scented steam, you feel like you're exploring an alien landscape.

Wildlife viewing in Yellowstone is unlike anywhere else in America. I spotted bison causing ""bear jams"" (yes, that's actually what they call traffic jams caused by wildlife sightings), watched elk graze in meadows while snow-capped mountains provided the backdrop, and held my breath as a grizzly bear ambled across the road just 50 yards ahead of our car.

# Southern Soul: Music, Food, and Hospitality

# New Orleans: Jazz, Jambalaya, and Joie de Vivre

New Orleans doesn't just have culture – it IS culture. Walking through the **French Quarter** on a Sunday morning, the scent of café au lait and beignets mixing with the notes of a distant trumpet, you understand why this city has inspired so many artists, writers, and musicians.

**Café Du Monde** is touristy, sure, but sitting at those green-and-white checkered tables, powdered sugar from fresh beignets coating everything while you sip that perfect coffee-and-chicory blend, you're participating in a New Orleans tradition that goes back generations.

The music scene here isn't just entertainment – it's a living, breathing part of the city's soul. I spent an evening at **Preservation Hall**, where jazz legends play in this tiny, intimate venue with no amplification, just pure music echoing off century-old walls. Later, I wandered down **Bourbon Street** where every doorway pulses with different rhythms – blues, jazz, zydeco, rock – creating this incredible musical tapestry that you can only find in New Orleans.

The food deserves its own paragraph. From **jambalaya** and **gumbo** that warm you from the inside out, to **po' boys** stuffed with crispy fried oysters, to **bananas foster** flambéed tableside, New Orleans cuisine is comfort food elevated to an art form.

# Planning Your First American Adventure

Here's what I wish someone had told me before my first USA trip: America is vast, and you can't see it all in one visit. Pick a region and dive deep rather than trying to hit every highlight in a rushed two-week sprint.

**Visa and entry requirements** are straightforward for most visitors. Citizens of 39 countries can apply for **ESTA authorization** online instead of getting a visa, which allows stays up to 90 days. Just make sure your passport is valid for at least six months beyond your travel date.

**Budget considerations** are real – America isn't cheap. Plan for $150-300 per day depending on your style, and remember that **tipping is expected** everywhere. In restaurants, 20% is standard (not optional), and you'll tip bartenders, taxi drivers, hotel staff, and many service providers.

**Transportation** varies dramatically by region. In cities like New York, San Francisco, and Washington D.C., public transportation is excellent. In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and most of the South and West, you'll want a rental car. Domestic flights are often surprisingly affordable for covering long distances.

**Weather patterns** change dramatically across the country. New York's winter is brutal, but perfect for cozy museum visits. California's year-round mild weather makes it ideal anytime. The South can be swelteringly humid in summer but gorgeous in spring and fall.

**Cultural tips** that matter: Americans are generally friendly and helpful, especially to tourists. Don't be afraid to ask for directions or recommendations. Portion sizes are huge – sharing meals is perfectly acceptable. And yes, you really do need to tip that much.

# Your American Story Begins Now

The truth about America is that it's not one destination – it's fifty different states with their own personalities, landscapes, and cultures all stitched together under one flag. Your first trip will barely scratch the surface, and that's exactly as it should be.

Whether you find yourself watching sunrise over the Grand Canyon, catching a Broadway show in Manhattan, surfing in Santa Monica, or listening to jazz in a dimly lit New Orleans club, you'll be creating your own American story. And I guarantee that before you board your flight home, you'll already be planning your return trip.

The America you've seen in movies and dreamed about is real – but it's also so much more complex, diverse, and incredible than any film could capture. Your first visit won't be your last, but it will be the one you remember forever.

So pack your sense of adventure, bring your appetite for new experiences, and prepare to fall in love with a country that somehow manages to be both exactly what you expected and completely surprising all at once. Your American adventure is waiting – and trust me, it's going to be even better than you imagined.",1,1749279206.0,TicketToEverywhere,0,1.0,False
1l5ekvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1l5ekvc/hr_the_campfire/,[HR] The Campfire,"It was a starry night under a canopy of pines in the rural outdoors summer of a country town that you would never remember the name. My uncle Stine was at the campfire, tending to it, while my sister and I were making the best of this time together. Neither one of us were outdoor enthusiasts and somehow my uncle managed to convince us to pack our things and accompany him out here. Now my uncle isn’t a man of many words himself. Mostly communicates to us in grunts and facial expressions. Yet around him we felt as safe as we do around the campfire. 



As the evening was extending its long arms to blanket us into deeper somber, the stars shone a bit more brightly and our uncle performed what we perceived as a miracle. He put a pot of water by the fire to get it boiling and with a raised, fairly thick dark eyebrow, asked “Did y’all want to hear an old story?”. Since he barely spoke his voice had a certain baritone that reminded you of chain smoker barely waking up from a deep sleep. How could we ever say “NO” to a story from a man that could win a game of quiet with the dead.



We nodded in a very surprised yet gleeful manner as the water began to lightly bubble. My sister and I huddled together to prepare ourselves. Uncle Stine started to hunch over a bit, resting his elbows on his knees. The fire crackled at a steady pace in front of him illuminating his dark brown eyes a lighter shade of maroon that made the campsite insects diminish in volume as well as if the anticipation of his words was a universal language. 



“This forest is old. The trees that have stood the test of time and even after death comes for them they still stand strong. Because of it they whisper things to each other in a language long forgotten to us in hopes that we will somehow remember and begin to listen to them. They whisper of the ‘White Ones’, old creatures that lived in a cave around here. Terrible things they were. White ones were once humans from a time when long toothed cats and hairy elephants would roam these lands.” They hunted what they could to survive and brought the hunts to the caves to share with the rest of the group.”



“In time they started to leave the cave less and less because something inside the cave would call to them. The cave gave them shelter, warmth and safety from the bigger animals outside but it came with a price. It was always dark in there, and the more time they spent the bigger their eyes would get to adapt to their home. Their skin would become lighter the more they realized that the best time to hunt was at night when all the other animals were asleep. Their limbs would get longer and thinner because of how much they would have to stretch their arms to travel between tight spaces and openings.”



At this point I start to get a little more aware of where we are as I start glancing to see if I can see any caves, with the stars shining down and the moon beginning to peak over the trees. My sister started tucking herself deeper into my armpit while my uncle started to hunch more  over ever so slightly as he was really about to engage us. The water started to bubble a bit more rapidly and steam started to rise. 



“Before long ALL the animals started to move further away from that cave, they could smell death coming from that hole in the mountain. Soon enough every creature knew that to stay alive they had to completely avoid that damned cave.White Ones never did learn to talk, all they could do was grunt and force all the air out of their lungs that sounded like a dying animal taking its last breath. The less food that they could hunt the more they looked at one another to see which of them could fill their hunger the best. The stench of death became a loud cry in the quiet forest. Somehow they kept enough of each other alive to still make offspring and realized that to survive they had to venture out farther away from the cave.”



“This went on for generations until they no longer resembled anything like a human. Freakishly tall, unusually strong, long thin legs and arms with skin paler than the moon, eyes as black as night with jagged teeth for tearing the meat off bone.” As Uncle Stine said this a thick cloud of steam came rushing from the pot of water and the bubbles violently started splashing onto the fire causing an almost fog like miasma to envelop us. He paused to take the pot off the fire and make a coffee. I could basically feel my sister become one with my left side. The moon was fully overhead casting shadows wherever its light touched. I was getting a bit more uncomfortable as I noticed the area was getting quiet as if it was holding its breath remembering the words coming out of Uncle Stine’s mouth. 



“A tribe of people eventually came and settled around the area of the cave seeing what the land was offering them. They were thankful for the abundance and lived the best they could. Every now and again a child would go missing or an adult would wander too far, never to return. That’s how it was back in those days, risks of living with other wild animals and the unforgiving terrain. When they did find corpses they noticed unnatural chunks of meat missing, jagged bite marks that didn't look like they belonged to any of the surrounding animals As if they were left there on purpose as a warning that there was some beast that reigned above all others.”



“The Hunters Moon is a special moon that comes every so often, it shines the ground so brightly that you could hunt with ease. On one particular Hunters Moon the tribe's people found something they had never seen or paid attention to before. A set of footprints that were longer than usual leading to an open meadow. The group of hunters followed the tracks thinking they would find a missing tribe member and bring them back home. What they found was far from what any of their darkest nightmares could ever dream of. A deer was being eaten in a way that just seemed like violence itself was savoring the meal. They were looking at a “White One” filling its unnatural belly with the warm red taste of meat. Blood was everywhere and it gleamed on the pasty skin that kept tearing bigger chunks out of this dead creature and swallowing them in what seemed whole.”                                                                                                                                      

“The wind gave away the group and they were too stunned to notice that the White One had stopped its ravenous feast to take in their scent. It bellowed a loud bone chilling scream to announce itself, a war cry that would turn the group to stone. Before they could load their bows the thing had fiercely galloped their way bearing down the closest throat it could latch onto. The other tribe members quickly drew their blades and all rushed in to stab into this monster. They succeeded in bringing it down but not before the monster let out one final death call that sounded like a higher than normal wolf howl. They all looked at one another and surveyed the surrounding area for any signs of ambush.”



“A sign of movement attracted all their gazes on a bush that kept rustinling with a strange sound coming from it.” \*Clink Clink Clink\* The sound of Uncle Stine mixing his coffee caught us both off guard. He took a sip and looked at us, his eyes asking us permission if we were ready to continue. We both silently nodded ‘yes’ and he resumed his hunched over position to resume his story. “Before I go any further, Max, can you hand me the” we all heard the wind rustle the nearby foliage and we all took a second to listen to see if there was any other sound that would follow. Silence fell upon us again.



“What they found in the bush was a smaller version of the creature that quietly made itself lay at the sight of the hunters. They examined it with hush utterings to one another while another tribe member examined the deer carcass. The same jagged teeth marks they had noticed on other animals were on the deer and their minds began to connect things that just seemed like unusual happenings unrelated to one another. All of the disappearances that happened always had footprints in the exact same manner of being slightly longer than usual but they paid it no mind. Now they knew it was these things, these abominations to nature that let animal instincts mix with human malice”



“What to do with that younglin’ however… The group of hunters decided to grant it mercy since it had been so peaceful with them. If they could train it like a dog to help them stay a step ahead of the others, they could live a better life. So they cut the rest of the deer and left a trail that it followed all the way back to the camp. Once there they gave it shelter and let it live among them. Trained it to eventually speak and guide them to other animals since its senses were so heightened. Eventually it began to take to the lifestyle of the sun despite its terrifying looks. The shaman of the village helped to ease the worries of everyone by saying that ‘This was the will of the great spirit’. And against all odds it somehow got a tribe girl pregnant. She was a very strange girl that was always fixated on this gentle creature because it reminded her so much of the Moon.”



“As time went on this new younglin hybrid was taller than most, had a slightly darker complexion than the father and could brave the Sun much better than its pappy. Just like life starts, so too must it end. One night a massacre occurred among the tribe. A group of hunters had gone out on another Hunter’s Moon with the gentle beast and the now teenage hybrid to round up some more animals to feed the tribe. Their adventure was stopped when they all heard the unmistakable shrill of a woman cue right through the cold night air. They all rushed back to camp, screaming like dogs, bleeding dark into the leaves. Their first sight was a White One, rabid, foaming at the mouth completely eviscerating an old woman as she desperately clawed at the thing to stop. Her blood curdling cries awoke a deep hidden rage amongst all the hunters, including their adopted members. Before long they were tearing that demon apart limb from limb. Just before the final slash reached its throat it bellowed out a death howl. Silence took over the whole camp to hear what would respond to this sound. Footsteps, so many footsteps coming from the darkness. So many flashes of white rushing through the bushes and treelines. All of them, just as mad as the one beside it, wanting flesh and that warm sensation of blood on their cold dead like skin.”



“It’s hard to say who won that massacre, it was like war. And in war there are no victors except death itself. Once all was said and done there was only the hybrid standing amongst the piles of bodies and fire. It didn’t know what else to do but go on its own and find another tribe that would hopefully accept it.” Uncle Stine reached across the fire to pat my sister on the head, never leaving his hunched position. He could see her shivering from the story. It had to be from the story since the fire was still crackling and giving us all the heat it could. His red flannel stretched long past the flame to give her comfort. I always forget that he was a long limbed man. It was probably just the story getting to me but I could swear that something about seeing that made me the tiniest bit uneasy. I shrugged it off and asked him to continue the story. 



“That was a long, long time ago and I’d like to think he found a new home and was able to have kids. Or at least that’s what my great great grandpappy told me that I could remember. The original tribe never did find that cave. As far as they knew up until their last breath they had killed all of the White Ones that night. And THAT little ones, is my story”. I don’t know why he told us the story since he’s never been the one to open up like that. I wanted to ask but I figured I was just get a blank look and never really get an answer anyhow. I looked up at the gorgeous sky to have the wind caress my face with a cold embrace. The cold embrace came with a weird almost iron like smell with a mix of something rotten. Something inside of me made me look around and figure out where that smell was emanating from. The breeze came from the top of the mountain and despite the Moon shining everything it could there was darkness enveloping that mountain side with an even darker spot towards the base. Something about that spot… there was something off about that darkness. I could swear there was something watching me. Peering at me.



Averting my gaze I see my sister still tucked as far as she could into my side. Looking up I see Uncle Stine perfectly still and now upright. His eyes seemed practically black now that he was a bit away from the fire. “I’ll get more firewood, we’ll need it to stay warm”. He got up and started walking toward the direction of that spot, never looking anywhere else. His skin looked a bit more pale in the moonlight tonight. Before long he returned with so much wood tucked into his slightly thin yet strong arms. “Are we going to need that much wood, Uncle Stine?” He nodded and grunted as he placed them in a pile. We heard another howl and the insects got eerily quiet. The fire itself seemed to crackle more softly to give us a chance to hear better. 



“I’ll keep the fire going all night, that way y’all can sleep better. Don’t y’all worry” He gave us a smile that brought the kind of comfort that a guard dog would give its owner. That night before going to bed I would hear light rustling noises around the camp. Between the fire and the moon illuminating what it could I swear I could make out figures of shimmering white out there. With an ever growing sense that more and more eyes were latching onto me, unto us. Uncle Stine sensing my apprehension let out a sound that sounded like some kind of weird low pitched howl. All rustling stopped to the point where not even the wind dared break this command of silence. I received a nod from Uncle and felt my eyes started to get weary. 



The last thing I remember was seeing all these glowing round things around the camp, fireflies I think they were. Or was it embers from the fire? Smelling smoke that was masking that smell of iron. Uncle Stine rolling up his sleeves looking at his wood axe that I’m assuming would be used to chop the fire wood. Remembering that Uncle Stine dropped something stealthy in the fire as he reached over to comfort my sister earlier. Realizing the smoke was getting stronger after that. I tried to panic myself awake but it was no use. Whatever he put into the fire had seeped deep into my lungs and there was no remedy to keep myself awake. 



My last image was of Him holding that axe in one hand, his bowie knife in the other and him letting out some bellow that caused the rustling to come back. All that rustling…that…came…back…

**What do I take otherwise? Straight B1 or Thiamine? Recs or brands?**

I read take with magnesium?...I am scared of taking magnesium because one type I used to take would put me in a coma for days (like a full sedation) and the other one made me, well, be on the toilet a lot? *You know helped the pipes flow?*

I wonder if there is an injection/shot like the b12?

Thanks in advanced! I cannot wait to fix me ha!

\----

**Background:**

* Don't drink at all. Never really have (alcohol) nor coffee
* Vegetarian mainy but will eat meat/fish 2-3 times a month.
* Mainly Mediterranean diet. Eat a lot of avocados, olive oil, nuts, bell peppers, mushrooms. 95% home cooked, fruits (kiwi, oranges, apples, berries) I eat pasta too. And italian and french cheese yum.
* Only take suppliments if I need them (Vit D in winter, zinc and vit c if feeling like im getting sick)
* Take Adderall for 8 years, 15mg only medication i'm on. (felt like it hasn't been working lately)

**Last 6 months** \- Feeling not myself. Blah. Just everything 'less'. Work, socializing, emotions, all less than normal. Kind of lost my spark. I thought I was having a burnout. Thought it was because of low Ferratin but iron infusion didn't really help. And forgetful! and dizziness when I stand. Periods were normal. And still slept normal hours 7-8 a night.

I felt surpressed. That I wanted to feel normal but something was holding me back. It's like I had a blanket on me that wouldn't let me access it. I also injured myself (ACL) which has taken 5 months to heal.. way too long.

Anyway enough was enough, my doc went all out and tested me for everything. Even lead!  
My B1 was the only thing to come back low now. Very low. I don't know a thing about it.",2,1749278707.0,Supplements,2,1.0,False

\[Bustling crew noises\]

Where’s Matteo? Dammit, I swear I’d give anything to not work with these stuck up A-listers!

I’m done pleasing those darned execs after this one. There will be no spoiled brat with expressions as plastic as his abs being backed up by his dad’s money on my sets anymore! 

Get the stand-in to fix the lighting for now. And for the love of GOD, Get me my AD right this instant!

What do you mean she’s “busy”? She’s supposed to be busy doing her job, which is following my orders.

\*scoffs\*

Oh, so that dollar store version of a ken doll needs to be escorted now? Yeah, tell his dad to arrange a chaperone for him then. Nobody monopolises my assistant, she’s MINE.

\*clears throat, covering up\*

To command, she’s mine to command. Now go fetch me my coffee.

How do I- ugh, see this is exactly why my assistant should be by “my side”. I like to take it black with two sugars, now scram!

\[pages flipping\]

\[Thoughts\]

How dare she tend to that muscular ape before me? I haven’t seen her at all today and the first person she decides to greet on set is him??

\*irritated\*

What? What is it now?

Ah, welcome, Ms. employee of the year. Mind telling me why you weren’t here by my side and busy brown nosing that bratty hooligan instead?

Yes of course, “Matteo” the nation’s husband\~ Whatever.

\*disgusted scoff\*

Oh such a peach you are for fetching me my coffee an hour after call time for the crew. That’s not what I asked.

\[Thoughts\]

Of course it’s perfect. This is why I always want- no. Need. I always need her to be by my side.

\[sips coffee\]

Thank your lucky stars it’s still hot. I need you to stand on the second marker right there.

Did I stutter? Yes you. Go stand over there to the right, that’s where I plan on marking the female lead in the frame.

\[footsteps\]

Hm…turn to your right.

Good God, yes you. Look, it’s gonna be a really long day if you keep staring at me like a deer in headlights whenever I tell you to do something. 

Now turn and take your glasses off.

No…this isn’t working…

\[footsteps\]

Don’t move. 

\[Thoughts\]

Man does she look stunning without her glasses. Ugh, and I used to be troubled over her wearing them in the first place since they made her look too darn cute.

\[Thoughts\]

I hope no one else gets to see her like this.

\[rustling as he takes her hair tie off\]

Much better…

\*brief silence\*

Oh, n-nothing I wasn’t staring or anything. 

And I only removed your hair tie because Cassandra and you have similar hairstyles and she’s supposed to have her hair open in this scene.

\[footsteps, chair creak\]

Alright, let’s take a look…

\*whispers\*

Now if we zoom in on that pretty little face some more…perfect. 

Nothing. Do you have a tissue or something in your pocket? I need you to remove any makeup you’re wearing. 

This scene is supposed to capture the raw intensity of their expressions.

Y-you’re not wearing any? \*whispers\* Damn, of course that’s just how pretty she is…

What do you mean I’m whispering a lot? I said don’t move. Now run Cassandra’s monologue from the script.

Oh, right. The script-

\*brief silence as he gets cut off\*

\*whispers\*

Well sue me, that was the most perfect delivery I’ve ever come across…

Huh? Nothing! Stop fidgeting, will you?

\[Thoughts\]

Why the heck is she not the female lead instead?

\[Thoughts\] 

On second thought, no. I’ll be damned if I let that jungle freak get his hands on her!

Huh? No, I’m not angry. Not at you anyways. \*whispers\* I could never be angry at you.

Just keep going.

\*sighs\*

Yes. The next dialogue, do it. Holden here can give you Matteo’s cues.

\*brief silence\*

\[Thoughts\]

Good Lord, she’s phenomenal. How the heck did I never notice how brilliant of an actress she is?? 

\[Thoughts\]

Wait. What is happening? Why is this Holden bastard moving closer? Why is she looking into his eyes like that??

\[flipping pages\]

\[Thoughts\]

Shit! This is the scene where they confess their feelings and share a kiss! I- seeing her this way made me forget all about that!

\[Thoughts\]

Even so, they won’t be kissing...right? The intimacy co-ordinator isn’t even here, and this is a mock shoot! They should be stopping any moment now.

\[Thoughts\]

Wh-why aren’t they stopping? What?! Does she really plan on kissing that bastard?? 

\[Thought\]

I bet he must be over the moon right now, that piece of shit! I’ve seen the way he looks at her. Just tailing her around like a lost puppy wagging its tail.

\[Thoughts\]

Get a grip on it man! That slimy bastard’s about to kiss your girl right now!

\*scoffs\*

CUT! Stop it!

\*Huffy\*

We’re done setting the lighting up. You both can move far far away from each other now.

You! Go tell that- “Matteo” that if he’s done using his suffocating hairspray for the thousandth time, we need his diva ass on set!

Now you, Ms. employee of MINE. Follow me.

That wasn’t a request.

\[footsteps\]

Because I have no other choice than dragging you by the wrist after the shit you’ve pulled today.

\[door closes\]

Hm, so what should I do with you, huh?

You know good n’ hell well what I’m talking about. What was that back there? 

Those eyes you were giving that bastard. 

Oh, don’t you dare play coy. First you rub shoulders with that dimwitted eye candy the moment you get on set, then you deliver a scene with Holden like you were soulmates with a tragic end in some past life.

\*leans closer\*

Do you enjoy lighting a fire up my ass like that?

Sweetheart, you’ve got me in a chokehold, and you know it. Don’t play with fire if you don’t wanna handle the heat.

I so can and I will, darling. 

Let’s see what you’ve got to say when I do this, shall we?

\*kiss\*

\*smirks\*

Lost for words? You really did have it coming after the stunts you pulled today.

Oh you’ve got my full, undivided attention after that. You sure you can handle it?

But real talk though, I’m so sorry for making you feel neglected. I guess I’ve been to stressed about Matteo and I need for this film to turn out well.

I swear I’ll make it up to you after we pack up today.

Yeah, I’ll give you a massage…I’ll buy you sushi from your favourite sushi place and we can cuddle up on the couch and watch some anime together…

Mhm, and then maybe after, we could-

\*knock\*

\*slightly irritated\*

Who is it?

\*brief pause\*

What do you want??

\*Listener shoves him\*

Ouch! Wait- Where are you going??

Ughhh you’re freaking kidding me…the one day that manchild decides to show up on time has to be this one, of course…

Fiiineee…yes, I’m the director I know. But just a final one.

\*quick kiss\*

Yeah, no. I’m stealing your hair tie. It’s my new bracelet now.

Boyfriend tax. You steal my hoodies, I steal your hair ties. Quid pro quo babe.

Plus it smells like your shampoo. You know I love that stuff.

Yeah yeah, your “expensive French shampoo” I like to steal. It’s part of the deal too.

\*giggles\*

I’ll get back to you after we pack up, okay?

\*smiles\*

\[Fade out\]

\[Bustling crew noises\]

Hm? What footage?

Ah, that. Keep it. For some behind the scenes n’ stuff. And send it over to me, will ya’?

Also, maybe crop that bast- Holden out of it.

1l5ebkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1l5ebkt/my_friend_is_incredibly_toxic_and_manipulative/,My friend is incredibly toxic and manipulative and yet they are still my friend because I don't have many,"So this isn't a jaw-dropping confession or anything, but it's something that has been weighing on me a long time and it would feel nice to just get it out there.

I have a friend (let's call them Sky) that I met through a videogame way back in like 2018. We talked all the time and eventually they would send me all these little care packages. We bonded over the same fandom so I was always getting gifts related to this fandom, really nice ones too. I got an autographed art piece from one of the voice actors, limited edition art books and figures, expensive makeup collections, etc... All kinds of nice things on a regular basis. I would always tell them no or say that they didn't need to spend money on me, but they always did anyway. Nothing I could do or say would stop them. And just in case someone asks, no, I didn't give them my address to receive gifts initially. At first we were just pen pals. I'd mail them letters and drawings I made and they'd mail me back their own letters with some candy or something. Then, the packages just started getting bigger and bigger. At one point every birthday, christmas, or even just because I'd get multiple huge packages in the mail with hundreds of dollars of candy and goodies.

I felt bad because I never had money to send them stuff like that. I'd try to buy them something nice off their wish list for birthdays and holidays, but nothing nearly as extravagant as they would send. I'm just a normal guy working a normal job and I don't have money to extravagantly spoil my friends, but they never seemed to care. I thought it was very kind and endearing. Obviously I appreciated them to no end. However, the longer I knew Sky, the more red flags I started to see.

I knew they lived on their own in a low income apartment. I knew that their brother lived over an hour away and they would spend most weekends with him because they didn't drive or have a car, and he would take them places and buy them groceries and whatnot. I didn't know the whole picture though. At first I got the impression their brother was just really well-off and worked a nice job, taking care of his sibling who wasn't as well off as he was. Slowly I started to realize he did it less out of adoration and more so because it had just always been that way and he never tried to challenge it.

Every year they went on trips to fandom/gaming conventions. They got to meet a lot of the voice actors for the games we played and were always planning the next big outing or purchase. Of course, these were all things Sky primarily wanted to do, their brother just never told them no.

It really became apparent when I visited them for the first time a few years ago. I would be staying at their brother's apartment because he had a car and would drive us to all the places they had planned for us to go. The first impression I had of the apartment was, well... Their brother slept on a cot in the living room with a half nude anime girl body pillow. There was trash and cat feces on the floor. I stayed there one week. Not only did neither of them shower the entire time I stayed there, but their brother didn't change his clothes for the entire week either. The same shirt and sweat pants he slept in was the same outfit he went to the amusement park in, the mall, restaurants, etc... By the last day he smelled so bad it was hard just being in the same room as him, let alone the small, cramped car.

Anyway, enough about him. I'm not trying to judge because he was an alright guy. It was clear he had some mental health issues going on as well as autism and other conditions. I was a guest being welcomed into their home so I can't complain about it. It was just eye-opening. During this stay I started to notice how manipulative and toxic Sky was towards their brother. 

Sky didn't have a job, they lived on disability but otherwise their brother, who worked in IT, paid for everything. That's when I realized all the gifts I had gotten from them weren't bought with their own money, but their brother's. They splurged on new clothes, makeup, youtube influencer merch, etc.. all on his dime. They also had hyper-fixations on a lot of things. For example, they always celebrated the birthdays of one of their favorite characters from the videogame we played. They also had a made up anniversary for their ""wedding"" day with this character. For that, they went out and ordered a walmart wedding cake to celebrate. A huge sakura themed wedding cake with black frosting. It was beautiful, but also very expensive. Then they had to order separate cakes for their birthday and their favorite character's birthday. Weird, yes, but for someone without a job or a family of their own or anything else really going on in their life, it made them happy and you know, to each their own. I just hadn't realized their brother was the one buying all of this. If he protested I guess Sky would just throw a fit and he would give in. But he never protested. I had no idea what their dynamic was like until I saw it.

Another eye-opening moment for me was one day on the trip when we went to a craft store because they wanted to buy some miniature items to go with the dolls they had of the videogame characters they liked. By this point in the trip I could tell Sky's brother was getting somewhat stressed out about finances. I know that miniatures at craft stores aren't cheap, and every time they insisted I get something I politely declined because I knew they wouldn't let me buy anything with my own money. They had consistently kept refusing that the entire trip. Because they didn't know when or if we'd ever get to hang out together in person again, and everything was special and they didn't want me worrying about a thing. Sweet, sure, but not at someone else's expense.

Sky's brother was very soft spoken and non-combative, but when the total at the counter came up to over $100 he was clearly very upset. Sky had bought a few miniature items and for comparison the brother had bought a single small dragon figurine. Nothing fancy or branded, just a toy dragon. When my friend heard the total they said something along the lines of, ""Oh my god, what did you buy!?"" Clearly refusing to accept that the expense was because of all the miniatures and insisting the total was on their brother for getting a small figure for themselves. 

There was another situation where I could feel things starting to escalate when we went to a theme park. Sky really wanted to go swimming, but the pool was only for the hotel. They kept insisting to their brother that we buy a hotel room just to swim for a couple of hours and then go home. This was the only time during the trip that he flat out refused because it would have been so astronomically expensive to buy a hotel room just to go swimming for a couple hours. Sky was **very** upset. They kept trying to persuade him the entire walk back to the car, which obviously made things really awkward. I kept trying to say how it was fine. We didn't have to go swimming. I didn't even bring a bathing suit. But they kept saying how they were certain we could just buy one there or swim in our clothes. ""It's not like it's a big deal or anything. People swim in t-shirts all the time."" It didn't matter how uncomfortable I was with the idea, they were pretty dead-set on it. Luckily, it didn't end up happening.

At this point in the trip I really started to feel bad. I tried to use my own money for everything and was declined every purchase. They would keep aggressively turning me down. Saying their brother had it, and he would nod and agree. It started making me stressed to go anywhere because every location we ""had"" to buy something and they wouldn't even let me purchase a small coffee on my own (I would've outright decline the coffee but by this point I was getting major caffeine withdrawals, and walking around all day in the heat was only making it worse).

So after the trip a few months go by and I hear some really crazy news that causes a complete blowout between Sky and their brother. I find out their brother got laid off from his IT job and all that money that he had ""saved up"" to use on our trip actually wasn't his, it was their father's inheritance. Their father had passed roughly a year before this trip. Sky wasn't super close with their dad and would always say he was a terrible, shitty person. However, Sky did not know their brother was basically spoiling them all on their father's inheritance money. And now the money was gone. All of it. All on fandom merch and tiny toy trinkets and random products advertised by beloved youtube influencers. 

The brother had never once even said he had the inheritance money or that he was spending any it. Sky had no clue that all those frivolous purchases were quickly decimating the only savings they had. I'm not placing the blame solely on either one of them here. Sky shouldn't have been taking advantage of their brother that way and the brother shouldn't have just wasted all that money without saying anything. It's all insane.

So now the brother has completely cut Sky out of his life. No contact. Now Sky is back to living on their own in a low-income apartment in the middle of nowhere with no way to get into town. They order all their groceries online but to be honest I think they mostly eat ramen while spending every dollar they get on more frivolous items.

Anyway, I know this is kind of all over the place. As someone without many friends and who was suffering one of the darkest depressive episodes of my life when I met them, I do truly care about Sky. However, I know Sky isn't a really good person. I am grateful for their friendship and all the things they've given to me. But at the same time I feel a little ashamed to continue being friends with someone like this. I've tried to point out the problems but.. there really isn't any getting through to this person. They are so stuck in their own delusions. They don't take any blame for what happened with the inheritance. They're always saying how if they'd known it was the last of the inheritance money how they would have planned it to stretch longer so they could still go to the next yearly convention or get that tattoo they've been planning for years.  

I hate to use the word delusional but it's the only word that works. I get that they have mental health problems, so because of that I guess I'm more forgiving/understanding. I continue to play games fairly regularly with them but so much that they say just... frustrates me. They spend the entire time going on rants about how they can't afford the new shade collection of a nail polish creator that they follow. Rant about not being able to afford all the in-game purchases. Rant about not getting to go to the same convention that they've gone to every year since when for most people it would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to go to that convention just once. Their reality is so far apart from mine that it's hard to warp my head around.

They don't have a job so they get annoyed when I can't stay up late and have to work. Or that I have bills to pay and can't give them $50 to buy the new fan merch they want or buy the most expensive expansion pack in the game so we can have matching virtual outfits or whatever. I try to share bits of my life or my hobbies and get blatantly ignored. They send me a dozen pictures of fanart of their favorite characters and push me to respond to each one while not even commenting on the fanart I made that took hours to create. I often feel like I'm just a body for them to talk about themselves and their obsessions but my own thoughts and opinions don't matter unless they mirror theirs.

It's exhausting... It's impossible to sum it all up in one post on reddit. To explain the toxicity without leaving out all the times they were there for me and the positive experiences we've shared. To explain why, despite it all, I still consider them a friend.

I really just wanted to get it off my chest and share some of the craziness so I'm not the only one seeing all this, if that makes any sense. I can't say all this to them without it spiraling into hysterics and denial. At this point in their life if they don't already see it, there isn't anything I can say or do to change it. I certainly stand my ground and I don't let them manipulate me like I've seen them do to their brother. I've pointed out that the things they've said or done aren't good, but they just don't want to hear it. Besides, most of it is their family drama. It isn't really my business anyway. 

It doesn't help that I have another very long time friend that shares a lot of the same characteristics as them. I desperately wish I had more decent friends but it's so hard to form genuine friendships at 30. Normal people have their own lives and families and they aren't looking to form a serious friendship with someone. I've accepted that's just the way life is but every time I open my phone and see a text asking for money or something I just feel so exhausted... I've slowly started to distance myself from these people more and more but I can't ignore the good things they've brought to my life. As a weird 30 year old neurodivergent individual it isn't easy making friends.

* $3,000+ spent on planners, apps, and courses that I didn't use.
* Started 47 different ""life-changing"" morning routines (lasted an average of 4.2 days)
* Bought a gym membership 8 separate times thinking this time would be different
* Downloaded every productivity app  (my phone had 70+ deleted apps)

I tried everything the gurus preached. Complex habit trackers with 20 different metrics. 5 AM wake-up routines that left me a zombie by noon. Elaborate reward systems that made me feel like I was training a golden retriever.

But at 38, something finally clicked. Not because I found some revolutionary new system, but because I stopped trying to be perfect and started being strategic.

What works after 15 years of failing:

* Never miss the same habit two days in a row. That's it. Miss Monday? Fine. Miss Tuesday too? Not allowed. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system I've ever used.
* Minimize decision. I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Sounds boring? It's genius. Eliminating these micro-decisions preserves mental energy for the stuff that actually matters.
* I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. Here's the magic: 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once the initial friction is overcome. Starting is the hardest part.
* I joined an accountability group and having other people invested in my success changed everything. Letting yourself down feels bad. Letting others down feels worse. Use that psychology.
* I attached new habits to existing behaviors. Stretching while my coffee brews. Reading while on the exercise bike. Planning my day while I eat breakfast. Stack new habits onto bulletproof existing ones. 
* Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked, what didn't, and adjusting for the coming week. Most people set goals and forget them. I treat them like a GPS that needs constant monitoring.

This advice won't get millions of likes on social media. There's no dramatic before/after photos or miraculous 30-day transformations. It's just boring, consistent systems that compound over time.

The difference between my 20s and 30s is I stopped chasing motivation and started building systems that work even when I feel like garbage.

I realized discipline isn't about willpower but on designing your environment and habits so that the right choice becomes the easy choice.

I wish I could get back the 15 years I spent believing discipline was about grinding harder and wanting it more. It's not. It's about being smarter with your psychology and environment.

Don't make my mistakes. Skip the shiny objects and focus on these 6 fundamentals. They're not exciting, but they're the only things that have worked after failing for over a decades

1l5e9hj,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1l5e9hj/is_it_really_gone/,Is it really gone?,"Is it really gone? The coffee cup I’ve carried with me for almost two decades? It still hasn’t hit me, I can’t believe it. A month ago I decided to do a caffeine cleanse for 3 weeks because I was sick and tired of being sick and tired. I felt the constant rollercoaster of ups and downs, the exhaustion, the crash, and it clicked. I finally recognized the pattern, I had seen this before….it was Nicotine right? I gave that up months ago. And wait, was it alcohol too? I gave that up 1 year and 2 months ago too..

All of a sudden I finally realized the pattern and power that addictive substances use on the human body. I knew I had to stop the ride. The first 3 weeks weren’t all that tough, I drank electrolytes, bought some flavored seltzer water, avoided Diet Coke but enjoyed Diet Sprite whenever I could find it. This wasn’t my first rodeo after all. Giving up Alcohol was tough, that one took me more than a couple of tries, but it looks like I learned more than I realized: I learned how to kick an addiction. 

What’s amazing to me now is that I don’t really miss this very personal “drink” that I’ve kept next to me for 15+ years. It feels like waking up one morning and realizing that you’re finally over your ex.

So where am I now? I’m not 100% against caffeine. I see it as a tool, if I didn’t get great sleep and I need to drive 3 hours, I’ll have a coffee. But I’m very vigilant about not making it a habit or a morning ritual anymore. I had one cup of coffee last week and felt palpable anxiety from the high and it just wasn’t the same. I know how addictive substances work though, they’re sneaky and they want you to keep using them, so I don’t. I’m also not 100% caffeine free, I’ll occasion drink a Diet Coke, or have tea, but the most important rule in my life now is to avoid creating unwanted habits around addictive substances. I won’t touch alcohol with a 10 foot pole, but caffeine won’t get me a DUI so I’ll indulge occasionally from now on, the point is, I’m finally in control. I hope this helps someone. I know not everyone is the same and some people don’t have the same willpower that I currently have, but it’s a mind muscle that can and SHOULD be worked out. Continue to do hard things. You got this.  

TLDR: My relationship with coffee and caffeine finally changed. There’s a clear pattern in addictive substances like caffeine, nicotine and alcohol, the they all have the highs and the lows. Take a 3 week caffeine break, think clearer, don’t form habits and rituals around caffeine, see it as a tool, Regain control. ",5,1749277921.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

1l5e36d,https://www.reddit.com/r/whitelabelseoagency/comments/1l5e36d/creative_menu_optimization_strategies_for/,Creative Menu Optimization Strategies for Restaurant SEO,"In the bustling world of dining, standing out online is crucial for restaurants. With diners often turning to search engines to decide on their next meal, optimizing your digital presence can significantly impact your foot traffic and reservations. Creative SEO strategies tailored specifically for eateries involve a mix of understanding local SEO nuances and employing tactics that make menus both mouthwatering and searchable online. 

Using structured data to create rich snippets and teaming up with food bloggers to get the word out, the possibilities are endless! A significant yet accessible tool in this arsenal is implementing schema markup. Here lies an unconventional strategy poised to elevate any restaurant's searchability by helping search engines comprehend what you offer as clearly as your customers do.  


# Implementing Structured Data for Rich Snippets

Let's talk structured data for rich snippets, a game-changer in restaurant SEO. First off, make sure you're using the correct schema types; Restaurant and Menu are non-negotiables here. If your menu changes seasonally or if there's a special event, update that markup ASAP to keep things fresh and accurate.  
  
Avoid generic ""Local Business"" tags; they don't pack the same punch as ones tailored for eateries. And remember, too much of anything is bad; overloading with irrelevant schema could hurt more than help. With proper implementation and regular updates through Google Search Console checks, your site can climb up search results fast.  
  
Making it easy for potential diners to find what they crave online boosts [local SEO for restaurants](https://seovendor.co/food-and-beverage-seo/).  


# Optimizing Online Reviews for Enhanced Discovery



1. **Leveraging Customer Testimonials:** Think of the power customer testimonials hold. They're not just compliments; they're solid proof that people like what you offer. Posting these reviews prominently on your website can boost credibility and encourage others to try your dishes.
2. **Boosting SEO through Reviews:** Reviews do more than reassure potential customers; they're gold for local SEO, too. Encouraging happy diners to leave reviews online increases your restaurant's online visibility, making it easier for new customers to find you when searching for great places to eat.
3. **Engaging with Review Platforms:** Don't just wait for reviews; actively engage with them on platforms such as Yelp or TripAdvisor. Responding graciously to both positive and negative feedback shows that you value customer input and are committed to improving their dining experience, fostering trust in prospective patrons.

# Leveraging Local Citations for Menu Visibility

Local citations are vital for boosting your menu's visibility online. Start by claiming your Google Business Profile, ensuring that your restaurant name is consistent across all platforms. This step alone can drive both foot traffic and online orders in a significant way.  
  
Then, list your business on popular directories like Yelp and TripAdvisor to improve search rankings further. Remember, consistency with contact information and business details across these listings is crucial for local SEO success; it helps build trust with search engines and potential customers alike. By focusing on accurate and widespread local citations, you'll make it easier for diners searching nearby to find exactly what they crave at your restaurant.  


# Crafting SEO-Friendly Menu Descriptions



1. **Simplify Your Navigation:** Crafting SEO-friendly menu descriptions starts with clean site navigation. People should find your menu in a couple of clicks. This ease helps both users and search engines discover what you offer faster. Each click is a step closer to dining at your place.
2. **Optimize Descriptions for Online Menus:** Menus are more than just lists; they're opportunities for keywords. Include dish names, ingredients, and flavors people might search for online. But keep it natural, like you're explaining the dish to a friend over coffee.
3. **Localize Your Content:** Tap into local flavors and ingredients in your descriptions, it connects customers with their community through food! Mention locally sourced items or dishes inspired by local cuisine trends subtly. This not only appeals to those craving local eats but bolsters nonbranded searches too.

# Utilizing Google My Business for Menu Promotion

Utilizing Google My Business for menu promotion is straightforward yet effective. Start by uploading your latest menu directly to your profile; this makes it visible immediately in search results. Keep the format simple, mobile-friendly, and easy to update since menus often change.  
  
Include keywords that diners might use when searching for dishes you offer. Encourage customers to leave reviews mentioning their favorite meals, boosting the menu's visibility indirectly. This method not only enhances local SEO but also drives traffic straight from the search page to your restaurant's door.  


# Incorporating User-Generated Content in Menus



1. **Highlighting Customer Favorites:** Show off the dishes that get rave reviews from your patrons. Put them front and center on your menu, both online and in print, making sure they're easy to find. Ask customers for permission to feature their reviews or photos alongside these favorites.
2. **Social Media Integration:** Use social media posts from diners as live testimonials on your website or digital menu boards. This approach adds a layer of authenticity you just can't replicate with professional shots alone. It turns casual browsers into eager guests when they see real people enjoying what you have to offer.
3. **Encourage Creative Interaction:** Invite customers to share their own creations based on your signature dishes or participate in seasonal recipe contests directly linked to your menus; winner's creations could make a limited-time appearance! Not only does this foster community engagement, but it also keeps content fresh and exciting.

# Engaging with Food Bloggers and Influencers

Reaching out to food bloggers and influencers is a smart move. Start by looking for those with high engagement in your area. These local gems can introduce your restaurant to their followers, who trust their opinions on where to eat next.  
  
Offer them something unique, like an exclusive tasting or a behind-the-scenes look at what makes your kitchen special. Encourage them to share their experience online, tag your place, and maybe even use a customized hashtag you've come up with together. This not only boosts visibility but also aligns perfectly with the idea that word-of-mouth referrals are vital for restaurants today, just like FinancesOnline highlighted regarding top-performing establishments leveraging technology for growth.

1l5e27r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1l5e27r/tell_me_if_and_how_bad_i_fed_up/,Tell me if (and how bad) I f**ed up.,"I reached out to my ex after 6 months and although I'm paraphrasing, basically said things ended abruptly and I wanted to allow her the option of saying anything else or asking anything else. I told her that I genuinely wish her the best and not to feel compelled to respond, that I hope I wasnt being selfish. 

This was today. I haven’t heard back just yet. 

I (30s male) ended things relatively mutually with my (30s female) partner 6 months ago. 

I've been working on moving on, processing, and literally trying to find myself and be happy with ""me."" The problem, something has been keeping me from feeling whole again. 

It wasn't ""her,"" per se. It has been this feeling I've had that there was some level of resolution that was still warranted, deserved, or at the very least needed to be offered.

When we split it was very cut and dry. I had already moved my shit out from a previous separation so I just had to grab a few belongings from my last stay. She had been working really hard on herself and recovering from past traumas. 

Long story short. The final split was through volatile texts, low blows, and I said ""let me go."" She responded a few days later and stated her intention to do just that. There wasnt a coffee shop meet where we mutually agreed, or a reconciliation of our truths. It just...ended...

The only time I reached out after that was to resolve some financial matters. Her last email had ended with a, ""I hope all is well."" I never responded and I guess it has been eating at me.

I realized in those last few messages and even before that I had become so hardened and showed such little emotion. I know she loved me and did the best she could, but due to both of our coping mechanisms, we essentially brought out the worst in each other in conflict and the best during good times.

I guess I sent the message so that in the end, I know that if there was anything that she truly wanted to say, or needed to hear to get closure, I eventually gave her that. 

The part of me that loves her felt like if I didn't do this, we both would move forward with things left unresolved, no real closure, and therefore no real healing. 

I didn't want to continue my life that way. Hope this makes sense. Any perspective would help.

As a young 22 year old, I was excited to be an intern after college at a resort in Andaman. It was the lean season and my friend's father owned the resort. He practically made me incharge of most things, considering their lack of funds to manage it. 

Despite the weak pay, I loved my job. I did it with passion and sincerity. It was a rainy night as usual and I was tallying the accounts in the cafe. We had one or two people in the resort, sitting at the cafe, sipping coffee when Miss/ Mrs. ______ , one of the most famous actresses in town, a siren and a sweetheart walks in. She was dripping in rain and was on vacation to heal herself after a string of flops and a divorce. She was looking to heal herself and have some fun too, being lonely for quite a while now. 

And here starts a hot game that takes us around the island. Your character could ask me to be your tour guide- take you to caves, take you on boat rides, swim together in the beach and go on cafe dates.
