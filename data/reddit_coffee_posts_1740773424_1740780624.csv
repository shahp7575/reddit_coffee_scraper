Ingredients:

‚úÖ 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

‚úÖ 1 teaspoon baking powder

‚úÖ 1/2 teaspoon baking soda

‚úÖ 1/4 teaspoon salt

‚úÖ 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened

‚úÖ 1/2 cup sugar

‚úÖ 1 cup cottage cheese

‚úÖ 2 large eggs

‚úÖ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

‚úÖ 1/2 teaspoon almond extract (optional)

‚úÖ 1 cup fresh blueberries (or frozen, if in season)



Preparation Method:



Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C). Grease or line a 9-inch round cake pan with parchment paper.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

In a separate large bowl, beat the softened butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the cottage cheese, eggs, vanilla extract, and almond extract (if using), mixing until well combined.

Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.

Gently fold in the blueberries, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.

Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

Let the cake cool for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.

Tips & Tricks:



For added flavor, sprinkle a little sugar over the top of the cake before baking for a slight crunch.

If you use frozen blueberries, do not thaw them before adding to the batter to avoid streaks in the cake.

You can enjoy this cake warm with a dollop of yogurt or pair it with your favorite morning coffee.

And now it‚Äôs asking me to rate my own replacement. That‚Äôs the plot twist none of us saw coming, yet here we are in the age of AI-powered chaos where startups are both thriving and gasping for breath, depending on which side of the AI coin they land.

Ever wondered how AI might revolutionize, or obliterate, your beloved startup? Enter Miles Cranmer, a physicist daring to let AI craft the path toward scientific breakthroughs. He envisions AI not as a merciless startup terminator but as a catalyst for accelerating scientific progress‚Äîkind of like Doc Brown's DeLorean, but with less flux capacitor and more machine learning mojo.

### Breaking Down the AI Conundrum

**The Nerd Power (Neural Networks vs. Einstein)**  
While Einstein gave us E=mc¬≤ out of thin theoretical air, AI‚Äôs math is no match‚Äîyet. Cranmer believes it‚Äôs because machine learning models start from scratch every time. Their short-term memory is worse than a goldfish‚Äôs, unless someone like Cranmer steps up to shove scientific memory into its algorithmic gray matter.

**Simulation & Data Drama**  
The challenge? AI has a serious data problem‚Äînot because it's running low, but because scientific data isn‚Äôt exactly lying around in droves like cat memes on the interwebs. To tackle this, Cranmer and the Polymathic AI initiative aim to build a scientific foundation as robust as Hermione Granger‚Äôs bookshelf.

**Why Not Let AI Pass the Science Baton?**  
Relying solely on AI for scientific discovery is like asking a toddler to run a coffee shop. It might spill resources left and right, unless trained with the rigor of a Hogwarts curriculum. That‚Äôs where Cranmer's symbolic regression library, PySR, comes in to save the day, decoding neural network predictions into neat equations that a scientist's brain can actually digest.

So, we find ourselves at a crossroad. Could AI-injected science erase the slow and steady method that has taken us this far? Or is it just the adrenaline shot our sleepy-eyed scientific process needs? 

ü§î Could AI take your startup by storm or potentially transform it into a runaway success? Share your AI tales‚Äîof terror or triumph‚Äîbelow and let's decode the future together!",1,1740780307.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm (28F) going to be cross-posting this across a couple of communities, so forgive me if you end up seeing this post more than once. I‚Äôve been dealing with this current issue since November 2024, which has felt like an **entire lifetime** even though it‚Äôs only been a few months‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a lot of ground to cover, so I might be somewhat vague in certain parts (but will provide as much context as I can!). I feel like I have done so much research over the past few months and am still at a complete loss, with doctors that are more keen to throw their hands up than to help me find real solutions.¬†¬†



Baseline context for me/my body before Nov 2024:

* Gallbladder removed 11 years ago due to it being full of gallstones, I am one of those individuals that had residual symptoms ever since then (bile in stool, loose stool, urgency, nausea, abdominal pain, etc‚Ä¶ was classified as IBS-D by doctors who were unconvinced of this connection and I accepted that.)
* I experienced uncomfortable episodes/flare-ups from time to time with these symptoms, but with the remedies I developed and learning my bodily cues, it was extremely manageable (my bowels very regular and ‚Äúon time‚Äù) with candied ginger and the VERY occasional Zofran. During my worst epsiodes, I would also experience vertigo, dizziness/weakness, trembling/abdominal ‚Äúspasming‚Äù that meclizine usually helped with.¬†
* I used to experience severe anxiety/anxiety attacks in my youth (due to trauma/ongoing abuse) that exacerbated these symptoms- with years of therapy, this has very much decreased, but I still will have the occasional episode that feels like it is amplified by anxiety (usually relating to me feeling unwell in public, I‚Äôm a relatively recovered (?) emetophobe.)
* On 2023 NYE/NY day of 2024, I got norovirus (or something akin to it) for the first time in my life and it wreaked havoc on me. Things haven‚Äôt totally been the same since, but there were no real severe changes until Nov 2024.¬†

Starting in mid Nov 2024, I began to experience what felt like a very sudden + out of nowhere severe GI health event/shift in my body‚Äôs normalcy. These symptoms were starting out small and spaced out, until they hit me all so severely one evening I thought I had contracted another stomach virus:

¬†

* Extreme fullness and pressure after eating a few bites
* Extreme burning in my stomach every time I swallowed a bite of food, dissimilar to the sensation of acid reflux/GERD, although I was starting to experience those symptoms more too now
* DEBILITATING nausea that nor Zofran or meclizine would take more than the slightest edge off of, leaving me feeling like I had to sit at the toilet for hours while never actually vomiting (noting that combined with this was an additional ‚Äúqueasy‚Äù/extremely unwell feeling that I‚Äôm not sure how to describe, not a feeling I‚Äôve experienced before with vomiting)
* Strange stomach pains and sensations that I have quite literally never even felt before in my body, which really scared me¬†
* Severe constipation‚Ä¶ which i have almost never experienced before in my entire life due to my IBS-D! (and all of the symptoms that accompany this)
* Extreme spasms stemming from my stomach area that left my entire body shaking uncontrollably as if I was freezing cold
* Tenesmus of varying severity, which leads to straining+nausea+unwell feelings
* Complete loss of appetite and complete disorientation of when to eat or drink something which made consuming anything an anxiety inducing chore
* ‚ÄúFake‚Äù hunger that would turn into nausea when I did eat

¬†

There may be a couple of symptoms that I am missing and will edit/add as needed, and so far, their severity has lessened to some extent because I had to radically change my diet to be able to go to work still.¬†¬†

I ate a relatively healthy diet before this happened full of vegetables, fruits, fiber, and carbs. I drank a moderate amount of coffee every day and I enjoyed my fair share of pastries. None of my doctors think this is diet related. Now, I can only consume an extremely low fiber diet that mostly consists of ensure drinks, dairy products, avocadoes, mashed potatoes, bread products, applesauce, and dry cereals‚Ä¶ occasionally some chicken or tofu if I am having a good week ‚Äì the irony is not lost on me that some of the only things I can actually tolerate are foods that usually get cut first in elimination diets, but I can‚Äôt afford to when there‚Äôs no direct symptoms pointing to them as the issue. I have lost over 15 pounds since November (still going, too..) and have battled many bouts of dehydration. I have weeks where I can eat relatively well within my diet, and then randomly I am forced by my body into starving because it decides it cannot consume anything without a severe reaction.¬†



I see one of the best GI doctors in my region of the country (mid atlantic) who has run quite literally¬†**every test/procedure under the sun on me**¬†(except for SIBO and a couple of other obscure ones) with¬†**every single test**¬†coming back absolutely clean save for some very small unrelated things (according to him). He basically refused to run anymore bloodwork or explore other options outside of immediate GI function (that‚Äôs a specialist for you, I suppose) and jumped to wanting to put me on TCAs despite my concerns, diagnosing me with functional dyspepsia (even though he acted very confused and unsure in this diagnosis when giving it to me, saying this was the only conclusion he could come to), and told me that he doesn‚Äôt believe I have IBS anymore or that I ever did based on the symptom profile that I have given him (???)‚Ä¶ while simultaneously not believing that my previous IBS-D symptoms were a result of my gallbladder removal. I just feel like he was very uninterested in the details that I felt like were possibly very relevant in this case, because I still don‚Äôt understand why this would just happen on a random Tuesday with no actual huge contributing factor. I have been getting established with a PCP in the past month who seems a bit more interested in helping me figure this issue out, but other than that‚Ä¶.¬†

**Some notes:**

* My life is currently relatively low stress. I work a lot, but both jobs I have are very low stakes and it is probably the least stressed I have been in my life (aside from about my health now, lol). I was in grad school until may 2024, and felt just fine health wise during those two years despite the extreme duress/stress I was under.¬†
* I have deep concerns about taking TCAs and most medications as a result of my own extreme sensitivities to most medications. Any time I have been given an anti anxiety med (as a child), or a sedating drug pre-surgery, I have had very stressful paradoxical reactions to them. I can‚Äôt even take cold/flu medications without reactions to most of them, especially Benadryl, etc‚Ä¶ If there is no other option available to me and I am more desperate than I am now, I will try them‚Ä¶ but just knowing my personal history, I feel very averse to taking them.¬†
* I have an acupuncture/tcm appointment this coming week to establish care and a treatment plan to try this route as I have heard good things in this regard.
* I tried a course of PPIs and they made things much worse. The only acid reducer that occasionally helps my symptoms is Pepcid AC/Complete.¬†

¬†

This situation has been so disorienting and I feel like I have lost my life in many regards, and I just want some semblance of my life back. I loved food so much and it would always be the center of my social interactions ‚Äì but even if we don‚Äôt eat together, I often feel so ill that I don‚Äôt have enough energy to even be social. It takes all I can just to show up to work most days. It also feels like people don‚Äôt actually understand that when I talk about these issues that I don‚Äôt mean that I can ‚Äúonly‚Äù eat a plethora of healthy/bland foods‚Ä¶ the amount of foods I can reliably eat I can count on less than 10 fingers‚Ä¶ and I am getting so nervous for when I inevitably get sick of eating the same thing everyday. I miss fruits and vegetables so fucking much.

I‚Äôm not exactly sure what I am looking for here, to be honest. I know we have to be our best advocates in these situations and I am reaching a point where I feel like I don‚Äôt know where else to look for answers, and I am also trying to temper my constant researching as it can tend to make me feel worse, symptom-wise. If anyone feels like they have any ideas, any suggestions for more holistic remedies or approaches, a direction to point me in research-wise, or can even just relate to what‚Äôs going on‚Ä¶ I would really appreciate any words.",1,1740780100.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

Hi guys. I (24f) have been dealing with interstitial cystitis (painful bladder), overactive bladder, and urinary urge incontinence for about over a year now. The past few days have gotten worse.

The other day, I was at a friend's house and leaked through to my pants. She gave me an extra pair of sweatpants and I changed in her basement's bathroom, which was creepy but I learned that I would rather die by ghost than embarrassment of other people seeing. We were roommate for two years and she's taken me to doctors appointments for this, so I wasn't super embarrassed by her knowing.

Yesterday at school, I had to change between classes for the first time. Luckily, I was able to use a private, single-person bathroom to change in and it was fine. (I use cloth-backed diapers provided by my insurance because I can't afford higher-quality but they work well for me.)

I have had to pee almost every twenty minutes, which is new. I have been feeling dizzy, tiring easily after only walking for short periods of time, and so I'm trying to drink water in hopes that it will help. I drink water and iced coffee pretty slowly. I know coffee is likely making it worse, but it's also a comfort thing so I am just 'accepting' the consequence I guess.

Still. I'm scared. I'm frustrated because I know I should book a doctor's appointment, but I'm hesitant because I've done this so many times before. I explain my symptoms, I do a urinalysis, it comes back fine, and then I just do my best to adapt to it.

I have an appointment in June for another intake with a urologist, but this one is a urogynecologist. I'm on the cancellation wait-list. In the meantime, I'm just so scared that I won't get answers, or that the answer will be scary.

I also have a new roommate who moved in last week. I have been successful in keeping this a secret so far. I have also been having more frequent accidents at night, which is kind of worrying me, too. I wear protection, have the bed pads, and dispose of my used products in my garbage in my room. I'm taking these precautions and it still makes me nervous. For a while, I was living alone so I didn't hide my products and I could crash out about it on my own. Now, it's just 24/7 shame and embarrassment. No one IRL has these issues too and I feel stupid for complaining about it.

I don't really know what I need right now. I am just feeling depressed and frustrated. I just want to go back to normal, and I'm scared that will not be possible for me. I just want my life back.

Experimental 001 - 100 G - I was very happy that I clicked ""rotation"" on the roasters section on the site and saw this.  After getting a 13 G freebie on the last drop, I have been anticipating this to come back in stock.  Super stoked to get 100 G of this.  Going to brew a few cups and then freeze the rest

AMOC Chiroso Colombia ‚Äî Wilton Benitez - 50 G
AMOC  - Ombligon Colombia ‚Äî Edinson - 50 G. - I was jealous of those who grabbed the AMOC coffees in a previous drop so I'm excited to try these.

Black & White - Brayan Alvear - Juicy Cherry - 20 G (dirtydials hooked it up and the bag is 40 G) -  I really love cola flavors in coffee, so had to try this one out.  brewed it this morning and it really tasted like a cherry coke, but super balanced and not fermenty at all.  helps that it is a month of roast, which is a really nice thing about these Rotations.

Black & White - Julio Madrid - Nitro Caturra¬†- 20 G (again got hooked it up with more grams on this one so thank you very much u/dirtydials) - after trying the Juicy Cherry, I wanted to try another wild one from B&W.  I had read about this coffee from other roasters and have never had watermelon notes in a coffee.  This tasted like a watermelon jolly rancher.  Super intense flavor.  After making a cup, I put it in the freezer for when I have visitors who think all coffee tastes the same. 

Manhattan - Inacio Soares F2¬†- 20 G - Don't often have Brazillian coffees and have been a fan of Manhattan in the past so decided to get something a little less wild compared to the other things I got in this drop.

Apollon's Gold - Fabian Lomas - 50 G - I've never had a sydra before, so i'm excited to try this out.  I'm expecting this one to be a bit difficult to dial in so it's really nice to have the 50 G.

Proud Mary - Mexico Ozolotepec - 20 G - this was a freebie thrown into my order.  I've never had anything from Proud Mary, so I'm excited to try it out.

Yesterday morning I took my first dose. I was going to wait until my day off, but then I realized I didn't want to be at home sitting there and waiting for anything to happen. Work was fine, came home and kinda irritable feeling. I sat down to wind down after work and watch a tv show but the whole time i was watching it my mind was nagging at me to get up and clean my room like i felt irritated seeing my room all messy in the corner of my eye I couldn't focus on the show. I made myself finish the show though cuz i didn't want to rage clean, so i cleaned my room after.

 I had a headache before bed. It was tension in my eyes and scalp so i did some eye stretches by looking up and then i clenched my scalp muscles and released them to relieve the tension, it worked but then my scalp muscles felt like they were spasming at the back of my head it felt like my brain was moving around. Maybe they were just slowly releasing after I clenched them but I was kinda freakin out if it was a seizure oncoming or something. I was fine lol

This morning I woke up and felt kinda anxious, im already kinda anxious flustered person so theres that. I felt tired n buzzy a couple hrs after taking it, kinda how i feel after too many cups of coffee, but it was nice bc usually i have like a sad tired feeling where i dnt have the energy to want to go to work. It wasnt that pit in the stomach feeling i usually get.

 I feel so energetic at work and find myself being good with the customers, usually it takes every fiber of my body to fake a smile or that customer service voice we all use at work lol...but today idk I'm just doing my job and my mind isnt screaming at me all day saying ""i dont want to do this"" which is so nice!

I know its only the 2nd dose and could be placebo/honeymoon period but thats my experience so far. It could just be that I have a positive attitude about it and excited to see what happens but idk I'm on break right now and my heart is beating kinda fast like I'm just amped up! Feel like i had a redbull lol i dont feel euphoria or anything tho, just a lil extra pep in my step. I have had 1 cup of coffee both days so maybe that's why, i cant give up my coffee!! Lol 

Also been drinking electrolytes powder and ordered some magnesium bc I already struggle with headaches nausea and migrane so I want to stay in top of that. 

Hoping it works for me!! Im taking it to quit smoking, for my anxiety & depression and also hoping to get some sex drive back. I was on zoloft and quit that a while ago, and also 588 days  in recovery from heavy alch use which probably contributed to fucking up my libido.

On a bit of a whim, I decided to start a compost bin today while doing some maintenance on my fruit fly and springtail cultures. I had a good amount of leafy kitchen scraps and a couple nectarines that went bad but can only use very small amounts at a time for the cultures so thought now was as good a time as any to start a compost. Here's my best basic breakdown of what I'm working with:

1. I'm between jobs so only able to use what I have lying around. Starting small with a small plastic dollar store bin; dirt from my backyard mixed with a bit of extra Coco peat; added ppt tube, Amazon package paper, and used coffee grounds with the greens.

2. My ST and FF cultures are for my caged pets, working on creating bioactive enclosures for my two rats and a gecko (hence the Coco peat). I'm hoping compost will also help maintain my cult's food source if I can pick chunks out to toss in the cults on occassion. And the critters from the cults will be appropriately used as food/cleanup crew (CUC) for said pets inside their cage. (Also plan to add isopods to my ST CUC eventually). 

3. I want to use my rat's waste in the compost. Their diet consists mostly of veggies, fruit treats, and a kibble/garden pellet mix. The most meat product in their diet is the handful of Orijen original cat food mixed with the garden pellets (probably = 1/4 or less of the mix) with the exception of the other day I fed them some scrambled egg as a treat.

4. I adopted my rats from the haunted house I work at. I'm not sure exactly where the rats are acquired, but being that they are ""paid"" actors and bought in bulk of 11 or so by mgmt, I would assume they are bred to be feeders rather than pets. 

5. My gecko is ababy house gecko I rescued from my cat that basically adopted me. So he/she is not bred from a pet store, came straight from outside looking for warmth on a cold day. 

6. I live in deep SE Louisiana, temps run very high ESPECIALLY when the sun hits enclosed containers after just few minutes. We're talking oven roasting temps, probably higher if outside constantly. It's also very humid and definitely not short of small critters and pests.

7. I started propagating some green onion and romaine scraps for the first time. I would also like to grow other plants (edible and non edible). However, I don't know how much I will be able to do yet, I'm just winging it as I go. But do plan to use the compost as fertilizer for both. 

My main question is, if I use the rat waste in the compost, what is the safest way to do so?? 
Since it will be potentially used for growing food and providing food for the CUC cults, I want to be sure not to transfer any bacteria/parasites/pests etc. to either me or my pets.

Will the container get hot enough to kill anything harmful? 
Should I use another method to ""prep"" the waste before adding it to the compost? (ie. burning, bokashi, just plain composting seperately, etc.)

Appreciate anyone who read this far. Hope it makes sense and the provided info is helpful. TIA! üñ§

*""This is my lens. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My lens is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.""*

For me, it‚Äôs a Summilux-M 50mm f/1.4 ASPH, serial number 4069261, paired with a UV/IR filter that gives it a strange pink reflection, purchased in the spring of 2008.

At the time, I was just starting photography, had just been accepted into a photography school in Paris, and‚ÄîI don‚Äôt quite remember how‚ÄîI managed to convince my mother that this, along with a Leica M8, was exactly what I needed to improve. And she said yes. Back then, Leica was offering a 10% discount on all new gear, the British pound was at a very favorable exchange rate against the euro, and so I was able to get it for just under ‚Ç¨1800, shipping included. Thank you Mom.

It was the first brand-new lens I ever bought, and, 17 years later, it remains the only lens I‚Äôve ever bought new (everything else was second-hand). When I think about it, this means it has cost me less than 30 cents per day. Cheaper than a coffee. A pretty good investment in hindsight.

Over the past 17 years, I‚Äôve used it on every single camera I‚Äôve owned, almost exclusively: on a Leica M8, on a Leica M9 I borrowed from work, on a Leica M2 when my gear was stolen (*oddly enough, the thieves took my iMac and my roommate‚Äôs Nikon D90 but left my vintage photo gear untouched*), on a Sony Alpha 7 when the first full-frame mirrorless cameras arrived, on a Leica M10-D I bought for my 30th birthday, and, in recent years, on a Leica M7.

Most importantly, during the ten years I worked as a journalist, it became my benchmark lens for evaluating sensor resolution, comparing the performance of much cheaper (and, to be fair, often objectively superior) 50mm lenses, and simply as a conversation starter with engineers from Sony, Panasonic, or Nikon when they visited our office.

This lens has been my most faithful travel companion and my oldest life companion. Together, we have photographed the Northern Lights, traveled to the very end of Australia, wandered through Tokyo, and bumped against Paris metro gates more times than I can count. It has captured all my girlfriends, whether for one evening or several years, all my colleagues, all my friends, and hundreds of strangers met in dimly lit bars, from Deauville to Shinjuku, from Barcelone to Bangkok.

And on top of all that, it takes pictures. Not too sharp and clinical, not too soft and vintage‚Äîjust the right balance to capture the sharpness of life and the gentleness of time passing. It‚Äôs a serious lens when stopped down to f/2.8, but at f/1.4, it seems to create light out of nothing. It‚Äôs a bit dented, quite scratched, I stripped off the yellow engravings with acetone (*I never learned to read distances in feet anyway*), and something tells me it‚Äôll still be with me in another 17 years.

His name was George Martin. Now, I had already known the Lord from my very youth, and I had been baptized to The Church of Christ in the Petuxent river at age 16. A very fundamentalist fellowship! To them, it seemed as if everything was a sin! But in my spiritual journey, there was just so much that didn't quite add up. I knew that there had to be more... Something they weren't telling me, and perhaps some things they just didn't know. But in my heart, since the day I prayed the sinner's prayer, I always asked God what more must I do to be saved? And that's what led up to my subsequent baptism and later to my baptism in the Holy Ghost and with fire! I began fellowshipping with friends at the Full Gospel Fellowship of The Assembies of God in Prince Fredrick, Maryland. It was there that I learned to loosen up! And I really, really enjoyed my fellowship there! But I was a troubled youth with a checkered past. I was the ginger-headed boy to whom everyone looked whenever there was trouble brewing in the neighborhood. It wasn't always me, and I wasn't always to blame, but with my bright red hair, I was always the one who stood out the most. I was, however, a teen alcoholic, and to get my booze, I did some not-so-godly things! One of which landed me before a judge.

You see, I broke into the neighboring Baptist Church and stole all the money from the offerings. It didn't go nearly as well as I thought it would! A state trooper watched me do the whole thing! He followed me home, and I was immediately arrested and charged with felony breaking and entering! And I subsequently appeared before a man rumoured to be a hanging Judge! Judge Bowen! But the miracle of miracles, he wasn't a hanging Judge on that day. He gave me the choice of either going to the Maryland Children's Center, a reform school with a friendly name, or one year in Teen Challenge! Naturally, I went with option number two, and off I went to the DC chapter!!

It was there that I had learned about the power of intercessory prayer and the speaking in tongues! We toured the nation, running a circuit of churches all across the country singing the praises and fellowshiping with many a Pentecostal fellowships en route. It wasn't my final destination but just the beginning of my spiritual education.

After Teen Challenge at age 17, I ran away from home and found myself on the outs with God and homeless in Hollywood. Sure, I knew Him in my heart, but I just didn't wanna pretend anymore. I didn't want to walk on eggshells anymore. And I was just sick of it. That's where George came in! Although I tried to shut him down, it wasn't working. So, I lied to him and told him I was a Satanist! And that I had offered my soul up to the highest bidder!! Well, lying or not, as it turns out, Jesus was the highest bidder of all.

George put forth a challenge to me, to just hang out with him for a couple of weeks, and I would get the one miracle my heart so desired! I wanted to see a man walking on water! In those two weeks, I never wanted for anything. Despite the fact that we were both homeless! Everything we needed was provided for, and in many cases, we didn't even have to ask for it. It all just seemed to jump into our hands! Everything!!! But at the end of those two weeks, George asked me what I thought. And I told him I was still waiting to see a man walk on water! Then he lifted his eyes Heavenward and prayed, ""Father, please open his eyes!""

Lo and behold, I had an entirely new perspective in me! It was as if an entirely new mind was given to me, and I could see it all perfectly, clear as day! I had seen not just one man but two men walking on the water, and I was one of them! With no visible means of support, we were well supported! Everywhere we went, all our needs were anticipated and met before we even asked.

On one such day, I was sitting in the Chicken Delight on Hollywood Boulevard. I had just enough for a small cup of coffee, and so my ""rent"" was paid. I was reading my pocket New Testament and Psalms when suddenly I wasn't there anymore. I was caught up!! In a vision as viceral as can be, I found myself present at the top of a very high staircase into the clowds with a doorway there before me. And two great urns on either side of the doorway filled to the brim with fist-sized nuggets of transparent gold. As I crept through the doorway, I became as a little child, small in stature! There was a table there without legs, supported by God knows what but fixed in mid-air. It was made of the same gold-like transparent material, and on it were all these dishes of various kinds of foods and refreshments. The likes of which are only Heavenly and can be found nowhere else on this earth! Spiritual foods for a spiritual people! I remember looking at myself when I was there, and I was nowhere to be seen. I was completely invisible even to myself, believe it or not. I remember knocking on the walls and tapping on the table, testing the reality of such things! I even walked up under the table and could see everything on it from the underside! That's when Jesus entered the room.

He sat down at the head of the table and He laughed and said, ""Do you know how long I have waited for this moment? Come up here! Sit on my lap and let me feed you."" And I did. Then he said to me, ""Seek out the depths of My Love, and I will give you My voice!"" Instantly, I knew in my heart that He had wanted me to share that same great spiritual cuisine He had shared with me. And He said, ""Feed My people! I you love me, feed My sheep!"" I remember gazing at a pizza oven just lover His shoulder in the corner behind him, and I knew that it must be with the same wholesome comfort foods with which He had comforted me! And I awoke back at that tiny table in the corner of the Chicken Delight where it seemed as if no time had passed at all.

I have since had many dreams and glimpses of visions of things that were and were to come. Things that were yet to be revealed to the world through me but were sealed up until the time was right. Many things that the Christians in this world today would be troubled with and hard-pressed to believe.

1j0iway,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepsMcPasta/comments/1j0iway/i_rented_a_cabin_in_the_appalachian_mountains_i/,"I rented a cabin in the Appalachian mountains, I saw horrifying things","My life had turned into one of those clich√© country songs. I was divorced, broke, unemployed, and pissed off at the world. Five years down the drain with a woman I thought I‚Äôd spend my life with, only to come home one day to find her already packed and halfway out the door. The job loss came a month later, and at that point, I figured the universe was just trying to kick me while I was down.

I needed space. No well-meaning friends telling me to ‚Äúfocus on myself‚Äù or ‚Äúfind the silver lining.‚Äù. To hell with all of that.¬†I didn‚Äôt want silver linings, I wanted silence.

So when I found a listing for an off-grid cabin in the Appalachian mountains, it felt like the perfect escape. It wasn‚Äôt some cozy rental package with a hot tub and a firepit on AirBNB. Just a barebones cabin buried deep in the mountains.

The description was short:

""Remote, off-grid cabin in the Appalachian mountains. No service, no electricity. For those looking to truly disconnect.""

No reviews, and the pictures were blurry, but it looked beautiful. It didn‚Äôt even have an exact location- just a general area and a contact number. Normally, I‚Äôd be wary of something that vague, but at that point, I didn‚Äôt care. I booked it for a full month.

The guy who owned the place was weirdly insistent that I couldn‚Äôt drive there myself. He said the trails were too easy to lose and that GPS was useless that deep into the mountains. Instead, he arranged for a local guide to take me up.

It made perfect sense - mountain roads, rough terrain, the risk of getting lost. Didn‚Äôt seem that strange.

I met the guide at a run-down general store about an hour outside the nearest town. He was already waiting when I pulled into the lot, standing beside an old ATV with a trailer hitched to the back.

The guy looked like he‚Äôd been living in the woods his entire life. Try picturing a stereotypical park ranger that‚Äôs been doing his job for a few years too long, that kind of guy.

""You the renter?"" he asked.

I nodded, tossing my backpack onto the trailer. ‚ÄúThat obvious?‚Äù

He just grunted and climbed onto the ATV. ‚ÄúGet in.‚Äù

The ride up was rough as hell. The trail was barely more than an overgrown deer path, full of sharp turns and sudden dips. After about an hour of bouncing over rocks and weaving through dense tree cover, we hit a clearing with no more road.

‚ÄúThis is where we walk,‚Äù he said, already unloading my gear.

I stared at him. ""How far is the cabin?""

""Few miles.""

I grabbed my bag, adjusted my jacket, and followed him into the trees.

The hike took another hour. And the deeper we went, the more I realized just how far removed this place was. There truly was nothing here. Just solid forest pressing in from all sides.

I expected to hear birds, bugs, maybe a distant stream. But at some point, the woods got quiet.

Not in a normal way. Not in the peaceful, ""wow, nature is so relaxing"" way. I mean quiet. I noticed that the guide also hadn‚Äôt spoken in nearly half an hour.

When the cabin finally came into view, I exhaled.

It was exactly what I wanted. Small, sturdy, a simple two floor setup with a wood stove and a creek nearby for water.

Just me, the trees, and miles of untouched wilderness.

The guide set down my gear on the porch and adjusted his cap.

""You‚Äôll be fine,"" he said, finally breaking the silence. ""Long as you don‚Äôt wander too far.""

Then, without another word, he turned and disappeared into the trees.  
  
The first few nights were exactly what I needed.

I woke up when the sun came through the window, spent my days hiking, reading, and just... existing. I finally didn‚Äôt have my ex-wife‚Äôs lawyer blowing up my inbox.¬†

The first time I realized how deep I really was in the mountains was on the second night.

I had stepped outside to do my business and was hit with the kind of silence you don‚Äôt get in normal life. It wasn‚Äôt just quiet - it was absolute.¬†

At the time, I figured it was just how the forest worked. I‚Äôd read once that predators moving through an area could cause sudden silences. Probably just a bear passing through, right?

So I shrugged it off and went to bed.

By the fifth morning, I started noticing things.

It wasn‚Äôt anything obvious at first. Just a sense that the landscape was slightly different.

The bushes by the treeline looked disturbed, like something had moved through them. Probably deer - plenty of them in the area. But as I walked over, I saw the dirt was churned up, like something had been digging or shuffling around.

Further along, I found scratches on a few trees. Deep ones.

I ran my fingers along the grooves, I had no idea what kind of marks bear claws would leave, but I figured this must have been a big one.

That was the first time I got that nagging feeling.

That weird, gut-level discomfort that something was off, even if my brain was trying to logic its way out of it.

I pushed it down.

Bears. Deer. Mountain lions. This was the wilderness.

If I was going to start jumping at every broken branch and disturbed bush, I was going to drive myself crazy.

So I went back inside, made coffee, and told myself to stop being paranoid.

But for the rest of the day, I couldn‚Äôt shake it.  
  
By the twelfth day, I was feeling at home in the cabin. It was still eerily quiet most of the time, but I had convinced myself that‚Äôs just how it was out here.¬†

I had been living off canned food and dry goods, but I still had a good supply of vegetables, rice, and seasonings. I figured I‚Äôd treat myself and cook something hot. A big pot of stew.

I knew cooking food outside was a gamble in the wilderness. Even with scent blockers, it wasn‚Äôt foolproof. If an animal got a whiff of it, I‚Äôd probably lose the whole thing.

But at that point, I didn‚Äôt care. Worst case, I‚Äôd be out some food.

So I built up the fire in the stone-ringed firepit, set up my cast-iron pot, and threw in everything I had. Let it simmer low and slow, covered it with a heavy lid, and, just to be extra safe - wrapped the whole thing in a scent-neutralizing tarp.

Then I went inside, stretched out in bed, and fell asleep to the distant crackling of the fire.

The next morning, I stepped outside and the yard was completely destroyed.

At first, my brain couldn‚Äôt even process what I was looking at.

The dirt had been torn up in massive swaths, like something had been clawing or shoving at the ground. Chunks of earth had been thrown in long, scattered arcs, as if something had raked through it with oversized limbs.

The bushes near the tree line were flattened, smashed down into the soil. Some of them were uprooted completely, lying in mangled piles with their roots exposed.

Several small trees were bent at unnatural angles, their bark scraped away in places.

I had expected to find it gone, obviously. Maybe the pot knocked over, the food licked clean.

Instead, the pot was shattered- split into pieces, scattered across the yard. Chunks of food were everywhere. Rice, carrots, potatoes - smeared into the dirt like something had deliberately flung them around.

It looked like someone had picked up the entire pot and slammed it into the ground. Over and over.

I stood there for a long time, gripping the railing of the porch, trying to wrap my head around it.

A bear would have eaten the food. Even a raccoon would have at least picked through it.

This felt like something had been pissed off, like it hadn‚Äôt been looking for food, but throwing a tantrum.

I swore under my breath and ran a hand through my hair, feeling annoyance outweigh the unease. I had been careful, and now I was down an entire meal and a good cast-iron pot.

‚ÄúGreat..‚Äù I muttered, bending down to scoop up some of the mess.

For the next hour, I cleaned up, trying to convince myself it was just some animal acting weird.

I buried the ruined food deep in the woods, scrubbed the yard down as best I could, and sat on the porch as the sun sank below the mountains.

I wasn‚Äôt scared, exactly, just annoyed. The whole thing felt like some bizarre prank, except there was no one out here but me. Whatever had wrecked my yard, thrown my food around, and smashed my pot had done it for no good reason, and now I was down a solid meal and cooking equipment.

I sat on the porch for a while after dark, sipping from my flask, staring out at the treeline. The night air was cool, the forest stretching endlessly into blackness beyond the dim glow of the cabin‚Äôs lantern.

I tried to listen for anything.

I laughed dryly, shaking my head. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought,‚Äù I spoke into the silence, before finally heading inside.

I bolted the shutters, stoked the fire, and crawled into bed, still smelling the faint scent of stew on my hands.

And then, the noise started.

It wasn‚Äôt loud, at first.

Just a faint disturbance, something pressing into the earth outside the cabin.

A long, dragging sound.

I lay completely still, eyes locked on the ceiling, heartbeat picking up.

Another step.

Then another.

I wasn‚Äôt imagining it.

Something was walking through my yard. In all my nights I‚Äôd spent here, I had heard nothing come this close to me yet.

The weight of the footsteps was deep, solid. Not a small scavenger, something big.

I strained my ears, trying to track its movement.

It wasn‚Äôt the erratic rustling of a hungry animal. It wasn‚Äôt snuffling through the dirt looking for scraps.

It was just walking.

I swallowed, forcing myself to stay calm. Of course it was back.

Whatever wrecked my yard last night was probably checking for more food. But there wasn‚Äôt anything outside this time.

I smirked to myself, rolling onto my side and pulling the blanket up. Joke‚Äôs on you.

I closed my eyes, listening as the footsteps circled the cabin- closer now.

A slow, steady crunch of something huge pressing into the soil.

Then, for a long moment there was nothing, so I fell asleep.

When the sun finally climbed over the mountains, I was itching for answers.

I grabbed my boots, stepped outside, and just stared for a second.

There, pressed deep into the damp soil, were tracks.

At first, I thought they were hoofprints- maybe from a deer or an elk. But as I crouched down, my stomach tightened.

They were massive.

And wrong.

The spacing, the weight distribution- they weren‚Äôt four-legged.

Whatever left these tracks had been walking upright, a bipedal.

I traced my fingers along the edge of one, feeling the way the dirt had been compacted, picturing the size of the thing that could leave prints this deep.

My head buzzed with static.

No. That didn‚Äôt make sense.

I stood up, scanning the yard, following the trail with my eyes. They led from the treeline, straight to the porch.

And then... they stopped.

Like whatever made them had just disappeared.

That night, I didn‚Äôt even try to sleep.

I was done pretending this was normal. Whatever had been coming to my cabin wasn‚Äôt just looking for food.

It was looking for me.

So I stayed up. I killed the fire early, doused myself in scent blocker, and sat in the darkness, knife in hand, waiting.

Waiting for it to come back.

1:43 AM.

The first sound was distant.

A rhythmic crunch of heavy footsteps pressing into the dirt.

I gripped the knife tighter, barely breathing.

It was back.

The footsteps approached the porch, and then - wood groaned under an impossible weight.

Something was standing right outside.

The floorboards creaked.

A slow, dragging inhale.

It was breathing.

I could feel the weight of it through the walls, a pressure in the air, like the whole cabin was shrinking around me.

I had planned to peek through the window, maybe even step outside and see what it was.

But I wasn‚Äôt so sure in the moment. Because whatever was standing on my porch wasn‚Äôt a deer, or a bear, or anything else that belonged in these woods.

It sounded huge.

I stayed completely still, every muscle locked, gripping the knife as hard as I could.

Then - just as suddenly as it had come - it left.

The weight pulled away from the porch, the footsteps retreating back toward the trees.

But I knew, somehow, that it wasn‚Äôt really gone.

It was just waiting for the right moment.

I didn‚Äôt sleep.

I just sat there in the dark, staring at the door, knowing that I had no way out of these mountains until the guide came back.  
  
I should have grabbed my pack, walked until sunrise, and never looked back. But I was too afraid of getting lost.¬†

So I made a plan.

I wouldn‚Äôt try to fight it. I wouldn‚Äôt try to see it. I would just hide.

The following night, I did everything I could to erase myself.

I doused myself in scent blocker, rubbing it deep into my skin, my clothes, my hair. I piled furniture in front of the bedroom door - not that I thought it would help, but it made me feel safer.

Then, gripping the only weapon I had - a rusted hunting knife I‚Äôd found in the cabin - I squeezed into the wardrobe and pulled the door shut.

I sat in the dark, knees to my chest, breath slow and controlled.

And then‚Ä¶ I waited.

This time, it didn‚Äôt make me wait long.

At midnight, I heard it.

It let out a sound - like a hyena choking on its own laughter.

Then, a loud bang.

The door downstairs shattered inward, the whole cabin shaking from the impact.

Heavy footsteps. Wood splintering. Furniture shattering.

The thing wasn‚Äôt searching cautiously anymore.

It was tearing through the cabin, breaking things apart as it moved.

A deep sniffing sound filled the air, dragging inhales like a dog trying to catch a scent.

I pressed myself deeper into the closet, tightening my grip on the knife.

The sniffing stopped.

For a long moment, there was silence.

Then, from just outside the bedroom - a heavy creak.

It was at the door.

I held my breath.

I wanted to close my eyes, to squeeze them shut and pretend I wasn‚Äôt there, but some horrible part of me needed to see it.

So I shifted - just slightly, just enough to peer through the slats in the wardrobe door.

And that‚Äôs when I saw it.

It had to duck under the doorframe as it stepped inside.

Towering - easily eight feet tall. Its body was a grotesque mixture of animals, as if something had stitched it together from several different corpses.

Its arms were long, ending in disturbingly human-like hands, except the fingers were doubled - two sets of knuckles, each twisting and crackling.

Its body was covered in thick, matted fur, except for its torso, which was strangely bare - pale, scarred skin stretched tightly over its ribcage.

A pair of antlers curled from its skull, but they weren‚Äôt symmetrical. One was twisted, bent at the wrong angles, jutting out unnaturally.

Its jaw didn‚Äôt match its face.

The mouth was wide, gaping too far, filled teeth that didn‚Äôt seem to fit together.

But, it didn‚Äôt‚Äô seem to have any eyes.

Where its eyes should have been, there were only patches of dark, sunken skin.

It was safe to assume that it was blind.

But that didn‚Äôt seem to matter.

It sniffed the air, turning its massive head in slow, jerking movements, its breathing deep and uneven.

It knew something was here, and it was angry.

It took another step forward, shifting its weight onto the wooden floorboards.

The scent blocker was working, but I didn‚Äôt know if it would be enough.

I stayed still, silent.

I didn‚Äôt breathe.

For a moment, I thought I was safe.

Then - it lunged.

Not toward me - but toward everything else.

It roared, slamming its fists into the walls. A guttural, furious sound, frustration twisting its movements into wild, jerking violence.

It ripped through the room, tearing the bed apart, knocking over the dresser.

I gritted my teeth, trying not to flinch.

Then -its hands landed on the closet.

My breath hitched.

The wardrobe shook.

I pressed myself as far back as I could, feeling the rough wooden panels against my spine.

The thing sniffed again, growled low in its throat.

Then - it shoved the closet over.

I crashed to the ground, tangled in wood and fabric, my knife slipping from my fingers.

For a single, agonizing moment, I thought- ‚ÄúThis is it.‚Äù.

But as I lay there, frozen, waiting for teeth and claws and death, I heard it shuffle.

And then it left.

I don‚Äôt know how long I stayed there.

Lying in the wreckage, staring at the ceiling, shaking so hard I thought my ribs might crack.

Eventually, the sun rose.  
  
I was out of the cabin before the sun fully broke over the horizon.

No hesitation. No second-guessing.

I didn‚Äôt care about my supplies, my food, or the fact that I still had weeks left before the guide was supposed to come back.

I just grabbed what I could carry - my backpack, a flashlight, the knife, a bottle of water - and I ran.

I didn‚Äôt look back. If I got lost, so be it, it was better than waiting to get killed by whatever that thing was.

All I knew was that I couldn‚Äôt be there when night fell again.

I tried to retrace my steps, following the same path the guide had led me down almost two weeks ago.

But the deeper I went into the woods, the more uncertain I became.

Everything looked‚Ä¶ different.

The trees felt denser, closer together, their trunks pressing in around me. The light filtering through the leaves felt dimmer than before.

I tried to focus, tried to match landmarks in my head.

That rock formation - I had passed that on the way in.

That fallen tree - had it been on my left before? Or my right?

Doubt crept into my mind like rust.  
  
The oppressive silence returned, and I thought back to that article I‚Äôd read, how the entire forest goes silent when there‚Äôs a predator around.

I wanted to believe it was an animal.

A bear, a deer, a god damned crocodile if that was even possible, anything, but what I knew it really was.

I wiped the sweat off my brow and kept moving.  
  
For whatever reason, it never showed itself during day time.

I walked for hours, the sun climbing higher in the sky, my legs burning from the effort.

But no matter how far I went, the feeling never left.

I was still being followed.

Not hunted in the way a predator goes after prey.

This was different.

It was letting me tire out, toying with me.  
  
All I saw were more trees.

And behind me, just at the edge of my hearing -¬†

That awful sound.

One moment, I was forcing my legs forward, dragging my body through the thick forest, lungs burning with exhaustion. The next, pure survival instinct took over.

Branches whipped against my arms. Roots snatched at my boots. My breath came and went, my vision blurred with sweat, and still - the feeling of being followed never left.

The sun was lower now, the trees stretching into elongated shadows.

And just as I thought I couldn‚Äôt take another step - I saw it.

The break in the trees.

Houses.

I stumbled forward, my body moving before my brain could process what I was looking at.

A small village.

Old buildings, wooden storefronts, a few houses tucked between them. A church steeple rising in the distance.

It wasn‚Äôt modern - not a row of houses with mailboxes and streetlights. This place felt old. Weathered. Like it had been sitting here, untouched, for decades.

But I didn‚Äôt care.

I didn‚Äôt care how strange it was, didn‚Äôt care how it wasn‚Äôt on any map I had seen before.

All I cared about was that it was civilization.

I had made it, I was safe.

Relief flooded me so hard I almost collapsed.

For the first time in hours, I felt something other than sheer terror.

I was out.

I turned.

I shouldn‚Äôt have.

I should have kept walking, should have run straight into that village, screaming for help.

And that‚Äôs when I saw it.

Standing just beyond the treeline.

A figure, motionless.

The last light of the sun stretched long across the dirt road, painting the sky in shades of gold and deep violet.

And just as the final sliver of daylight dipped below the mountains -

It moved slowly.

It got down to a crouching position, like it was getting ready to run.  
  
The first building I reached looked like an old general store. The wooden sign above the door had long since faded, but I didn‚Äôt care what it was.

I just needed to find someone.

I pushed through the door, the bell above jingling as I nearly collapsed inside.

The air was thick with the smell of dust and aged wood. Dim lantern light flickered from the walls.

A few people stood inside.

Men in old work jackets, a woman behind the counter, a boy sitting on a stool near the stove.

They all turned at the same time.

Their expressions were blank. Not surprised or alarmed, but definitely curious.

I gasped, trying to catch my breath. My throat felt raw, my lungs burned. I must have looked insane - covered in sweat and dirt, shaking like I‚Äôd just crawled out of a grave.

I tried to speak, but my voice cracked.

‚ÄúI - I need help,‚Äù I managed, gripping the doorframe. ‚ÄúSomething‚Ä¶ something‚Äôs out there. In the woods.‚Äù  
  
They said nothing.

No ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù No ‚ÄúSlow down, son.‚Äù No ‚ÄúThat sounds crazy.‚Äù

Just silence.

Then, after a long pause -¬†

The woman behind the counter stepped forward.

She didn‚Äôt ask what I had seen.

She just looked me dead in the eye and asked, calmly, carefully -

**********TLDR: Ragman in Rostok is the only vendor who will buy broken guns. Your personal stash infinite. 1. Get guns 2. Ragman 3. Profit

""Red run""- *Red* condition guns (broken guns) *Run* to get them and get back to base/Ragman.

So, 

Ragman, that slimey bastard, will buy your broken guns so go out and get some for him. Take missions for killing Kingpins or bandits, loot around the Duga(if it's open), Malachite, Yaniv, and Red Forrest area. Or my personal favorite area for this, the Cooling Towers. These areas are likely to have higher tier enemies that have better guns. Cooling towers is good because you have the Cement Factory base not too far but this can really be done anywhere. 

Doing this requires a lot of running with extra weight so looting close to bases is ideal. Also you will need water or energy drinks to run with your loot back to base faster.

No matter what upgrades, meds, or artifacts you have your max carry weight is 140 so to do this effectively, you will need fo hit that mark (dont carry 140 but you will need to see that as your max carry weight so you know you have the highest carry weight possible). Hitting 140 is easy with the ""Weird Water"" legendary artifact and a medium carry weight artifact together. Pair those 2 with some endurance enhancing Artifacts and you're  ready to start playing stalker like it's fallout lol.

REMEMBER: Ragman (aptly named) is going to bend you over an anomaly on prices so DONT SELL ANYTHING TO HIM OTHER THAN BROKEN GUNS. He will give you a terrible price on everything even if his vendor icon is green. Take everything else to the other vendors in Rostok. Ragman is a bottom feeder. Feed him your trash, broken guns.

After about 5 runs, you should have a good amount of money.

I would recommend looking for guns that have a good balance between high sale price and low carry weight. My favs are (in no particular order)

I never keep binge food in my house except sometimes a snack i have been craving.

My stomach is paralyzed and hurts a lot but keeping down small and satisfying meals without pain is so freeing.

The thing i struggled the most with was distancing myself from a meal once i finished. I find making a coffee it drinking a beverage after eating helps to distance yourself from the food and taste.

I can enjoy a pastry sometimes without feeling guilty and needing to binge. I still have the urge and think about bingeing but distracting myself and settling down to another thing than food (ex; gaming, doing dishes, taking a walk,‚Ä¶) helps a lot.

When i go to the store i allow myself an unhealthy treat together with healthy and whole foods instead of buying binge foods. It really helps me have a stable diet and my weight stays the same.

Recovery is not linear and can take a very long time but every small success feels so worth it. I still binge purge sometimes but can easily pick up the better habits.

1j0ipjb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j0ipjb,Living Room Furniture Layout,"

Hello Reddit -

I recently moved into a new apartment with less space than I had previously. I would like to set up the living room for a) lounging/entertaining a few guests, b) a small workspace, and c) a small (2 person) dining space.

I drew up what I envision the layout to be - does it make sense or is it too cramped? Would you arrange it differently? A couple considerations:

- I‚Äôd like a couch that could comfortably host a visitor overnight (~80-85‚Äù total length from what I‚Äôve looked at). I‚Äôve tried to arrange the entertainment area in the corner but with the addition of a couch and the TV size it seems cramped and too close to the TV. I‚Äôm looking to slightly downsize the TV console for the space or consider wall mounting, but the sound system is currently connected to a receiver and record player/gaming system.

- I‚Äôm planning to get a smaller desk for my workspace so it fits in the living area, but I would still like a ~34‚Äù curved monitor to fit on the desk. Ideally I would like to separate the sleeping and working space, but could set it up in the bedroom if things get too cramped.

With those things in mind, I‚Äôm struggling to find a way to fit in a small dining area. I think I could get a coffee table to double as an eating area, but would like to have a dining area that is a defined space.

1j0ijju,https://www.reddit.com/r/puer/comments/1j0ijju/raw_ripe_tcm_warm_cold_etc/,"Raw, ripe, TCM, warm cold, etc","Rewind 10 years. I was young and brash and downing young raw puer like it was nobody‚Äôs business. I couldn‚Äôt get enough.

At the time I was ordering all online from the usual suspects. Drinking it always alone. Nobody I knew even knew what it was. It was the best of times. Packages arriving from overseas multiple times a week. Anyway, not important‚Ä¶

Then, discovered that there was a shop that had just opened up in Toronto (where I lived at the time) that specialized in Puerh.

I went with my wife, who didn‚Äôt and doesn‚Äôt drink it at all. The man who worked there was really into the TCM aspect of things. He had a sheng and a shou and those were the options.

He took my hand and felt my palm. He took my wife‚Äôs hand and felt hers.

He told me I was meant for shou. My wife was meant for sheng. No discussion. That was that and he went to get us our teas.

I scoffed at shou at the time! I drank young sheng and double IPAs and funky natural wines! I was sooooo insulted. I drank it and it was fine and I loved on.

Over the next ten years, I ordered very little new puerh. I had enough to last a long long time. I went through a coffee phase. My puerh drinking grew intermittent.

Fast forward to a few months ago. I missed it terribly. I started digging back into the puerh scene. Longed for some fresh young sheng. I placed a bunch of orders at my old favourites and some of the new kids on the block (new to me anyway).

It‚Äôs been interesting to see how things have changed over the last 10 years.

Anyway, my point: sheng just isn‚Äôt doing it for me like it used to. The qi can be a little unsettling, too much in my head. Too disorienting. Sometimes, if I‚Äôm not careful, it can make me a little nauseous (this goes for young and aged, and even some aged whites). I still really like it but I need to be much more careful with it than before. A bit of an anxious vibe when I drink it.

But shou (young and aged) and yunnan black hit me just right. Chill. Warming. And a nice mellow huigan.

Could there have been something to what the old puerh man was saying years ago? I can‚Äôt find a ton online about the TCM aspect of puerh. Warm/cold. Weak/strong constitution. Or is this just what happens when you get old?

I‚Äôve been downing this shixi like its water, while the 2024 lao man‚Äôe, my old favourite, is going much more slowly.

On a side note: Mylar and boveda packs weren‚Äôt a thing 10 years ago but have changed the game completely for me. I know there‚Äôs a lot of info on using them to age tea, but I‚Äôm finding they improve tea for drinking now dramatically. Makes the young sheng and shou way more plump and fragrant and interesting during this cold dry winter, and is reviving quite a few of my older aged teas. I‚Äôm back, baby!

I've been unable to have any background app open while playing it, the game kinda forced closes it after seconds and when I go to the phone home page to open it again (it doesn't even show at the notification tab) the game reestart and becomes a loop. I do have noticed that the RAM goes to 3.5/4GB which kinda explains but I play heavier games and there's isn't any problem like this.

Also, while playing after some minutes it starts stuttering/lag, which make it so much harder to hit perfect when dropping coffee, drawing on latte or heating milk.

Except for these I do love the gameplay and everything else and haven't had any other problem.",2,1740777053.0,GoodCoffeeGreatCoffee,0,1.0,False

I recently have been doing my one year masters and I became part of this friend group which I really have a lot of fun in. I like this girl in my friend group and we are way closer than I am with any of the others in my friend group!

We hang out often, we get food, drinks and dinners sometimes and it‚Äôs always fun. We have done this often cause we live closer to each other than rest of the friend group! We also often study together and I like spending time with her.

I know quite a lot about her and she‚Äôs an amazing person but I have never got the chance to ask her whether she currently is interested in dating people but do know about her recent ex and what went down.

I have not seen her as a romantic interest since the beginning but along the way, I started to like her and I really want to ask her out. I am not sure how to do this and I am really scared to do so. I don‚Äôt know if she likes me the same way but she does enjoy my company and she often says so.

We all recently completed our exams and she was not able to write them cause she was sick and she is writing it next week and I am helping her study as well and she keeps telling me how good of a person I am to keep helping her all the time.

I don‚Äôt know why I am so scared but I want to know your suggestions guys. How do I ask her out? It‚Äôs been a while for me and I have been out of the dating game for a long time and have no idea what to do. After her exams are done, I want to ask her if she would be interested in going on a date with me. I have been thinking of this for months now and am not sure if it‚Äôs a good idea or even how to do it. Cause going to coffee and all is easy but I wanna ask her in a romantic context. I would appreciate your thoughts guys and also you could ask me for any specifics so I could tell u about the situation!

This whole process made me realize how quickly we get caught up in life‚Äôs struggles and forget to actually live. We‚Äôre constantly stressed about something instead of just enjoying the moment. Another thing I realized is that no matter what problem I‚Äôm dealing with, there‚Äôs a huge chance that someone else has been through it too. That thought weirdly made me feel a little better.

Hope you enjoy reading :)

# 20s

**Financial and career Struggles**

A lot of people at this age are still living with their parents, not necessarily because they want to, but because rent is ridiculous. Even if you land a decent paying job, which can feel like winning the lottery, it‚Äôs not always enough to cover rent, student loans, and other expenses.

A lot of people in their 20s feel stuck in survival mode, like they‚Äôre running to stay in place. It‚Äôs frustrating because this is supposed to be the time when you explore, take risks, and enjoy life a little.

**Figuring out Life**

A lot of people feel this weird pressure to have their identity figured out, who they are, what they want, what their values, all while social media constantly reminds you that everyone else seems to have it together.

Everyone keeps asking, ‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs your plan?‚Äù

The pressure to have everything figured out by a certain age is exhausting. You‚Äôre supposed to be building a career, maintaining a social life, staying fit, and maybe even dating, all while dealing with the anxiety of not knowing if you‚Äôre making the right choices.

**Am I even an adult?**

Then there‚Äôs the whole ‚ÄúAm I even an adult?‚Äù feeling. You‚Äôre paying bills, maybe working a full-time job, but deep down, you still feel like a kid who somehow got thrown into this world of taxes and responsibilities.

**Relationships**

Some people are settling down, some are casually dating, and some are out trying to figure out how to meet people without it being awkward.

**Friendships**

Making friends in your 20s is as hard as dating. Friendships start shifting because people are busy with work, moving away, or in different life stages. It‚Äôs not like school where you see your friends every day, now you actually have to plan to keep in touch. A lot of people start feeling lonely because making new friends as an adult isn‚Äôt as easy as it used to be.

**Family and Independence Struggles**

There‚Äôs often pressure from family, whether it‚Äôs about your career, relationships, or how you‚Äôre supposed to be living. Some parents still treat their adult kids like teenagers. It‚Äôs a weird in-between stage where you‚Äôre technically an adult but not always treated like one.

# 30s

**Financial and career Struggles**

Whether it‚Äôs student loans, credit cards, or a mortgage, it feels like there‚Äôs always something eating up your paycheck before you even get to enjoy it.

Then there‚Äôs the job situation. Some people are thriving, and others are trying to survive the 9-to-5 grind without losing their minds. The idea of switching careers sounds amazing but also terrifying. do I really wanna start from scratch again?

Basically, your 30s are about you juggling money, career moves, and existential crises while trying to sneak in some fun when you can.

**Struggles with Identity**

Your 30s are basically the season finale of your 20s, and suddenly, you‚Äôre questioning everything. Am I where I‚Äôm supposed to be? Did I waste too much time? Is it too late to switch things up?

Regret over past decisions is real. Maybe you wish you had traveled more, taken a different career path, or not been so scared to take risks in your 20s and the fear of being ‚Äútoo old‚Äù to start over.

**Health Concerns**

Hitting your 30s is when you start realizing you‚Äôre not invincible anymore. Suddenly, you wake up with random aches. It‚Äôs that weird stage where you‚Äôre still young, but your body is starting to remind you that you need to take better care of it.

**Friendships**

Everyone‚Äôs busy with careers, relationships, kids, whatever, so you don‚Äôt randomly hang out like you did in your 20s. If you don‚Äôt actively schedule time to see people, friendships can start to fade. And if you‚Äôre single while most of your friends are getting married or having kids, it can feel lonely, like you‚Äôre being left behind while everyone else moves on.

**Relationships**

People know what they want more, so there‚Äôs less playing of games. But on the other hand, dating apps can be exhausting, and there‚Äôs this weird pressure to hurry up and find someone before it‚Äôs too late.

**Burn Out**

A lot of people hit a point where they‚Äôre burnt out. You wake up, do the same routine, and wonder, Is this it?

**Hitting milestones**

A lot of people in their 30s talk about feeling like they haven‚Äôt hit those traditional ‚Äúadult‚Äù milestones, marriage, kids, homeownership, a clear sense of direction, and it makes them wonder if they‚Äôre behind or playing by a different set of rules.

**getting old**

One day, you‚Äôre living your life, and then suddenly, things start changing. You see college kids and realize they were born in the 2000s, you catch yourself groaning when you stand up, and you actually start caring about things like fiber intake and a good night‚Äôs sleep. It‚Äôs not even that you‚Äôre old, but you definitely don‚Äôt feel as young and carefree as before.

# 40s

**Financial and career Struggles**

Some are doing well, stacking up savings and growing their income, but many others feel behind, still paying off debt, worrying about retirement, or wondering if they‚Äôll ever own a home.

If you‚Äôre doing well, you‚Äôre probably stressing about keeping it that way. If you‚Äôre struggling, it‚Äôs more like, ‚ÄúOkay, so do I ever get to retire, or am I working until I drop?‚Äù

**Health Concerns**

For a lot of people, physical health starts demanding attention in ways it never did before. Suddenly, that random back pain isn‚Äôt going away, your knees sound like bubble wrap, and somehow, ear hair becomes a thing.

Now you‚Äôve got routine screenings to schedule, cholesterol levels to monitor, and friends casually dropping the phrase, ‚ÄúI have to get a colonoscopy next week.‚Äù

**Friendships**

Social circles shrink, not because you don‚Äôt want friends, but because who has the time? You text back and forth with someone for months trying to plan a coffee meet-up, and by the time you actually get together, you‚Äôre both exhausted.

The loneliness can sneak up on you, too. You‚Äôre constantly surrounded by people, kids, coworkers, family, but deep down, you might feel like no one really sees you.

**Relationships**

Some people are happily settled, but a lot of couples hit rough patches, realizing they‚Äôre more like co-managers of a household than actual partners. Divorce happens, and for those newly single in their 40s, dating can feel like a completely different game. Some people have never been married and are wondering if it‚Äôs too late to find love

**Parents and Kids**

If you have young kids, you‚Äôre probably running on caffeine and whatever sleep you can grab. Finding even five minutes of personal time feels like a luxury. And for some, it‚Äôs not just raising kids, it‚Äôs also managing aging parents.

**Questioning life decisions**

A lot of people hit their 40s and start questioning everything. Did I pick the right career? Am I where I thought I‚Äôd be by now? Is it too late to switch things up? ‚ÄúWait, is this it?‚Äù And then there‚Äôs the looming realization that time is moving fast, which can trigger anxiety about aging, regrets, and the whole ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my purpose?‚Äù spiral.

**getting old**

you start catching yourself saying, ‚ÄúBack in my day‚Ä¶‚Äù Like, you don‚Äôt even mean to, but it slips out.

Then there‚Äôs the unsolicited life advice. You see a younger person stressing about something in life and you go ahead and start giving advices like there is no tomorrow. You know you used to roll your eyes when older people did this to you. You used to think, ‚ÄúOkay, Grandpa, relax.‚Äù But now you are that person.

Starting to understand life

You start realizing what really matters. The friendships you do have become deeper. You start caring less about what people think and more about what makes you happy. And despite all the chaos, you get these moments, watching your kids grow, laughing with an old friend, seeing your parents smile.

# 50s

**Financial and career Struggles**

Some people are coasting toward retirement with a solid plan, while others are looking at their bank accounts thinking, Wait, I was supposed to save how much?

You start realizing ageism is very real. Suddenly, you‚Äôre removing graduation years from your r√©sum√© and praying that hiring managers don‚Äôt do the math when they see your experience.

You‚Äôd think experience would count for something, but nope, many companies seem more interested in hiring younger workers.

Health Concerns

Spinal issues, joint pain, weight gain that refuses to budge, and for some, even hair loss. One day, you‚Äôre fine, and the next, you need reading glasses to read a restaurant menu.

**Trying to Keep up**

Technology moves fast, and for a lot of older adults, keeping up can feel like a full-time job. It‚Äôs not about learning new apps, it‚Äôs about constantly adapting to updates, security changes, and entirely new systems. One day, you finally figure out how to use a smartphone, and the next, everything moves to AI and the metaverse.

In the workplace, this can be a huge issue. If you‚Äôre in your 50s or 60s and job hunting, employers might expect you to know software that wasn‚Äôt even a thing when you started your career. And if you don‚Äôt? Well, good luck getting hired.

**Getting old**

Society loves to remind people that they‚Äôre ‚Äúgetting older,‚Äù whether it‚Äôs by showing you targeted ads for anti-aging cream or watching younger coworkers speak an entirely different language.

the world starts treating them differently. They might be overlooked in the job market, assumed to be ‚Äúout of touch,‚Äù or not taken as seriously.

You start noticing that movies and shows don‚Äôt center people your age anymore unless they‚Äôre playing the wise mentor.

**Dating**

If you‚Äôre single at 50, whether by choice, divorce, or life happening, the dating scene can feel‚Ä¶ weird. But on the flip side, dating at this age can also be freeing, you know what you want, you‚Äôre not playing games, and you‚Äôre definitely not wasting time on people who don‚Äôt bring you peace.

**Relationships**

A 10- or 20-year gap might not matter much in your 30s and 40s, but once one partner hits their 60s or 70s, the differences become more obvious. One person might still want to travel and be active, while the other is slowing down. Then, there‚Äôs the reality of caregiving. If you‚Äôre the younger partner, you might find yourself taking care of an aging spouse way earlier than expected. That can be tough, both emotionally and physically.

**empty nest**

For parents, there‚Äôs the whole empty nest transition. One day, your house is filled with noise, chaos, and grocery bills that make no sense, and the next, you‚Äôre standing in a too-quiet kitchen wondering if you should text your kid or if that makes you clingy.

**Starting to understand life**

By 50, you‚Äôve probably got a solid sense of who you are, you care way less about what people think, and if you‚Äôre lucky, you might finally have the wisdom and the financial means to do things you actually enjoy.

The awareness of time becomes very real. You start thinking less about climbing ladders and more about making memories. It‚Äôs not so much about having time as it is about using it well. That‚Äôs why a lot of people in their 50s start prioritizing experiences over things, traveling, picking up hobbies, reconnecting with old friends, or even making a big career change.

**Mental Health**

Mental health can take a hit in your later years. There‚Äôs grief from losing loved ones, anxiety about the future, and even feeling lost. A lot of people hit their 50s or 60s and realize they don‚Äôt know who they are outside of work or family responsibilities. That can lead to some deep self-reflection or, for some, a midlife crisis.

**Loneliness**

Retirement sounds great in theory no work, no stress, and free time. But for a lot of people, work was their main source of social interaction. Once that‚Äôs gone, it can be really hard to meet new people.

**Housing**

Figuring out housing as you get older is a huge decision. A lot of people start thinking about downsizing, maybe moving into a smaller home, a condo, or even a 55+ community. These places can be great because they‚Äôre designed for older adults, often with social activities, maintenance-free living, and a quieter environment. But on the flip side, they can feel too isolated, like living in a bubble with no younger people around.

# 60

**Financial and career Struggles**

A lot of people in their 60s are feeling the pressure when it comes to money and retirement. Some thought they‚Äôd be chilling by now, but instead, they‚Äôre stressing over savings (or lack of them), pensions that don‚Äôt exist, and whether they can actually afford to stop working.

**Getting old**

Then there‚Äôs the whole longevity and quality-of-life thing. A lot of people in their 60s are thinking about how to stay independent for as long as possible. Nobody wants to feel like a burden or lose control over their own life, but aging comes with its own challenges.

**Health Concerns**

You wake up feeling tired, and tasks that used to be easy suddenly take twice as much effort. Then there‚Äôs the joint pain. It‚Äôs not discomfort, it‚Äôs a constant battle to keep moving despite the pain. And if you slow down too much, it gets worse.

Cognitive decline is something a lot of people worry about. Maybe it‚Äôs forgetting little things here and there or feeling like your brain takes longer to process stuff.

**Loneliness**

Then, there‚Äôs the emotional side of aging. Losing friends and family over time can be really tough, and social circles start shrinking. People get busy with their own lives, and sometimes, you realize you‚Äôre spending way more time alone than you used to.

**Legacy**

At a certain point, thoughts about legacy and mortality start creeping in more often. It‚Äôs not about how much time is left but how to make it count.

It‚Äôs also a time for reflection, looking back at the choices made, the paths taken (or not taken), and wondering what kind of impact was left behind. For some, that means giving back, writing a memoir, or making sure they‚Äôve said what needs to be said to the people who matter.

There‚Äôs also the reality of how to face the final years with dignity, purpose, and hopefully, peace. No one likes to dwell on mortality, but it‚Äôs natural to think about how to make the most of the time that remains.",2,1740776496.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

When I was 13 my parents took my sister and me on vacation to nyc (we lived in London at the time but moved to nyc a couple years after this trip, as my dad‚Äôs originally from there). We‚Äôre enjoying the trip and after a couple days my parents tell us we‚Äôre going to visit a woman in StuyTown, around the lower east side Manhattan. They said she was old friends of a woman who was basically my surrogate grandmother/babysitter growing up in London, and my parents had met this friend before in London a few times, but me and my sister never had. 

So on the day, we go as a family to see this woman (I think she was in her 90s) and we get to her front door. Let me preface this next part by saying I wasn‚Äôt religious, spiritual or anything of that nature until this day made me question things heavy. I now believe in energy/cannot be created or destroyed but know I will never fully understand.  

We ring her bell and the woman opens her apartment door and we walk in. My whole body feels like it‚Äôs immediately hit by what I can only describe as a huge overwhelming WAVE of realization and shock. My heart started beating faster and I felt like I had been metaphorically slapped in the face. I KNEW this apartment, and it felt like I had lived there for decades, I literally cannot put into words how familiar and close I felt with this apartment. My parents are greeting her and chatting away and I‚Äôm standing paralyzed by this feeling and my hearts going a mile a minute‚Ä¶ 

For context the front door opens up into the living room, the kitchen is to the left and to the right there‚Äôs a corridor leading off the living room that had 4 doors. I start freaking out internally and ask my parents ‚Äúwait have you brought us here before?? I know this apartment‚Äù and they‚Äôre like no, we never brought you here and you haven‚Äôt met her either?? So I‚Äôm trying to tell them, no I KNOW this place I‚Äôve lived here... 

I‚Äôm so freaked out at this point I can‚Äôt move from the living room and stayed right by the front door, and in my head I‚Äôm getting vivid detailed images of all the rooms in the apartment, as clear as if I was looking at photos of them. So then I‚Äôm pulling my moms arm and dad telling them to go look in the rooms and tell me if what I'm picturing is accurate because I feel too terrified to explore‚Ä¶ (which was a bit awkward as we‚Äôd entered this woman‚Äôs home and my parents are trying to talk to her and I'm on the side looking stressed). 

I told my parents to go down the corridor and start describing to them from my mind; the first door on the right is the home office, with floor to ceiling bookshelves that wrap around the right wall to the back wall, and a wooden desk on the left side of the room with lots of mail and drawers and pens‚Ä¶They go in and come out looking weirded out and they‚Äôre like yeah‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs exactly as I described. I can‚Äôt believe it so I peek my head round to see for myself, and now I‚Äôm freaking out even more seeing it with my eyes just as I was just seeing it in my mind. 

I then tell them to keep going down the corridor and give details as to what each room is and how it‚Äôs laid out, furniture window placement, beds,, where the bathroom is, everything and they go look and come back to me in the living room and they‚Äôre like‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs completely accurate. At this point we‚Äôre all freaked out, and my parents are still trying to socialize normally with the nice woman. But they were very perplexed as to what was happening and how I knew all of this. 

So I‚Äôm already feeling frozen but somehow everything gets EVEN weirder. In the living room, this woman had a statue that was about 1 ft tall, maybe a little less, placed on a small round coffee table by the windows on the left side of the living room. It was a darkish grey metal statue of a woman standing, with her hair sticking out around her head that sort of made a big hair crown that looked like the suns rays. This statue had what I can only describe as a WHOLE aura surrounding it, this bright intense light that I could see was sort of pulsating slowly, bigger and smaller outlining the whole thing ( I noticed it immediately as I walked into the apartment). It felt like the statue wanted me to see it and was begging for my attention, standing out to me so much out of all the clutter and ordinary items. I have never before or since seen anything like an aura, I didn‚Äôt even believe they were a real thing.

Nothing like this or anything remotely similar has ever happened to me since this day and it still weirds me out. Can anyone shed light??!

I'm tucked into some trees in the woods. I've been rolling the dice walking past a bowling alley on my way to and from camp. They come out the side door fairly often take out the trash. A couple times an hour. Keeps the excitement up! Nothing is quite as fun a sneaking around some trees and bushes while looking out for a perceived adversary, in the war of finding a place to chill. I'm pretty sure someone from the bowling alley has seen me. I shaved yesterday and got hit up by homebums. It seems to throw off the locals too. I think anyone from the bowling alley who has seen me either doesn't care, or thinks I'm going around the side of the building to smoke weed. (I mean... I am...)

The last few days... Sleep in, wake up, smoke, get stuff together. Head for park near library. Coffee, smoke. Hang in library. Go get pizza and a drink for $5. Back to park near library to eat. Smoke x2. Back into library. I've briefly talked with the security gaurd. Now we're friends. Always a wave when he sees me.

Hang in library until things are charged, boredom sets in, buzz wears off, library closes, etc. DG on the way back to camp for munchies. Walk through the biggest, most well lit parking lot in history like I own the place. Carrying a bright yellow grocery bag. Perform look and sneak maneuver while coming around the far corner near the woods. Coast clear. Go fast while not appearing to be trying to go fast through the gate with 'No Trespassing' signs. Quick right into ditch and hole in trees. Another right. Into woods. Smoke. Movies. Munchies. Smoke some more....

Bike week starts today in Daytona. I'm a little north of there. 'Should I go down and get myself into some debauchery? Hmmmm...' The jury's still out...

I've seen deer come through my camp to drink at the lake close by. There's probably twenty different birds where I'm at. Lots of butterflies... And one thoroughly lazy hitchhiker that hasn't made many miles. I must've needed a vacation from my vacation. üòÅ

I should check the weather and see how far north I'm willing to go...

I have a lot of stuff I would like to either process and freeze or make some meals this weekend for the week. 

delivered today: Celery Root, Spinach, Turnips, Parsnips, Chicken Breast Bacon, Eggs (plus a few other thigns- coffee, butter, milk, juice, apples) 

Left from last week: White sweet potatoes, onions, shallots, Chicken Sausage diakon radishes

  
this points to a soup for me - but i am also open to other ideas. i have never made a soup without a recipe before and I have never used celery root, turnips, or the diakon radishes in anything complexbefore so i am not sure if they fit here or not.  

I have some better than bullion on hand to help make a stock (also new to me!)

What would you put into the soup? how much is too much? any tips?

1j0hchs,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1j0hchs/feeling_guilty_for_something_i_didnt_do/,Feeling guilty for something I didn‚Äôt do,"Hi! I (20M) live in a rented house with 3 M roommates of similar age. I have an extremely bad memory and don‚Äôt remember anything I do past 2 weeks ago other than impactful and a few scattered events and I have GAD. 

One of my roommates ‚ÄúJ‚Äù likes baking for our friends and bought some expensive gluten-free chocolate chips a few months ago(one of our friends has celiac). A week ago he noticed that they had been opened, half the bag was missing, and it had a clip on it. He asked all of us and all of us denied taking them. The other 2 roommates are very trustworthy and so they‚Äôre suspecting me because at some point in the past few month someone remembered I mentioned wanting something chocolatey. I don‚Äôt remember how I resolved this, but I likely just ate some chocolate syrup. 

My memory and instinct is telling me for certain that I did not eat them because knowing myself I 1) wouldn‚Äôt find it worth it to steal chocolate chips, 2) even if I wanted them, I would almost never be the first one to open the bag, 3) I wouldn‚Äôt steal something that expensive/hard to get, 4) I don‚Äôt tend to open bags in the way that this bag was opened. If I were to steal something, it would be a jolly rancher from a massive opened bag or a splash of milk from an opened carton for my coffee. However, they still regard me as the most likely suspect.

1j0h4pb,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/1j0h4pb/how_will_the_rush_to_fund_defence_increases_be/,"How will the rush to fund defence increases be paid for, is it slash and burn of essentials, or wealth taxes like the run up, during, and after WWII?","We are all being told war is inevitable, that defence spending needs to be massively increased, ya de ya...

Around the world aid budgets are being slashed (which help to prevent war and calamity like pandemics and mass migration from environmental collapse) or have always been woefully low, slashing at home social services and safety nets (which were always struggling), back tracking on climate change targets (leading to more of the environmental issues mentioned earlier) which were already not ambitious enough, nickel and diming essential infrastructure with ""second hand corolla"" crap for decades, slashing experts in government and science and filling them instead with lackeys, easily laid off contractors, or just vacuums... slashing taxes again and again for decades and profit driven privatising all the things for the imaginary ""trickle down"" and ""efficiency"" all of which over the last 50 years that have led to our current tinpot shitbox everything.

All of this seems utterly contrary to the messaging they are telling us, contrary to all rational though of gearing up our essential infrastructure and society and expertise and logistics capability for the impending fight ahead...

For context, the runup, during and decades after WWII wealth taxes (income AND inheritance) for those worth over equivalent of several million were set at and eye-watering 80-90% - and there were also anti profiteering regulations and price control on the statutes. After that time, starting in seventies the world then over compensated (as per usual üôÑ) with the invented notion of trickle down voodoo economic nonsense we have had since. Reaganism/Thatcherism/Rogernomics... and a gradual return to populist and sometimes openly xenophobic wannabe authoritarians being elected with open arms around the world. Has history stopped being remembered?

If we are really saying we need to increase defence spending, if we are really saying we need to prepare for the next inevitable war, then surely it is time to enact the same again - and not just expect the poorest to be paying the costs in terms of degraded everything (as well as the poorest that will be shoved into the next meat grinder of the front lines). Maybe being faced with the actual consequences of our actions and war costs, people will start to realise how bad it is going to be and we can pull back from the brink.

You cannot have it both ways. It's either a real thing that needs to be paid for and needs proper funding via taxation and profiteering controls OR it's actually just *business as usual* slashing public services, infrastructure and taxes on the already well off and continue the profit-first mindset that we have been in since the 70s.

It all kinda makes ALL the currently recently elected people (i.e. not just in NZ) seem foolish on the populist claims they made for what they were ultimately elected for. All the slashing taxes and slogans like *making great again*, *back on track, take back our country, real change,* folks.

Will a small majority continue to be gullible and keep voting for those that actively divide us getting us pointing fingers at each other rather than being united in what is best for the majority? Probably. Our species deserves all we get.

I have had insomnia for what feels like my entire life. Pediatricians would dismiss it as ‚Äújust puberty‚Äù when I was a child/adolescent. In young adulthood, doctors can‚Äôt be bothered with me whatsoever. I get told it‚Äôs ‚Äújust depression‚Äù or to stop using my phone before bed, which I don‚Äôt do because I know it will negatively impact my sleep.

Now the specifics of my sleep issues. When I say insomnia, I mean that my body is literally repulsed by sleep and refuses to do it naturally. Flat out refuses. And no, this doesn‚Äôt translate to me needing less sleep or feeling better on less sleep. I need 9+ hours to feel well-rested, and I successfully acheive that maybe once a month with an ungodly amount of marijuana, if even that.

On to the marijuana use. Primary method of consumption is edibles since I don‚Äôt like smoking. It‚Äôs the only thing that increases my chances of falling asleep, but never a garuntee. I roughly estimate that I average maybe 6 or 7-ish hours of sleep that may or not be interrupted with marijuana, with some nights being worse or better just depending on the day, but this is such an improvement from anything my body is capable of naturally . I have tried literally everything else under the sun. I swear to God I could drink an entire bottle of Nyquil like its cranberry juice and not feel a damn thing (I did come close to this once.) As far as marijuana goes, I also need to consume A LOT to even have a chance of it working.

I also speculate I have some sort of strange drug metabolism in my responses to stimulants/depressants that might be a factor here. When I drink coffee for example, could be as early as 5:00 AM, I‚Äôm still wired like I just drank it 30 mins ago by 11:00 PM and won‚Äôt sleep. On the flip side, my entire family and my roommate swear that Benadryl has them out like a light. I‚Äôve taken up to FOUR and felt at best a light buzz!!!!üò≠

Help me out y‚Äôall. Suggestions on diagnosis I can look into or anything. The weed cycles through periods of working to not working at all, I took 75 fucking mg last night and sleep for 3 goddamn hours. I‚Äôm also scared to quit because it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got rn.
