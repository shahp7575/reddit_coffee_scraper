I work in sales for a tech company. My dad got diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer in March and the doctors said he had maybe three months. He wanted to die at home, not in some hospital. My mom couldn't handle it alone so I told my boss I needed to use my PTO. All of it. One week. That's what I had saved up.

My boss, let's call him Greg, said ""Is there any way you could postpone this? We're in the middle of Q2 push and I really need you closing deals."" I just stared at him. Postpone my dad dying? I told him no, I'm taking the week, and he said ""Well I hope you understand this puts the whole team in a difficult position.""

I spent that week feeding my dad through a straw, changing his bedding when he couldn't make it to the bathroom, reading to him, holding his hand while he cried about not getting to see my sister's kids grow up. He died on a Thursday morning. I was there. My mom was there. It was quiet and awful and I'm glad he wasn't alone.

The funeral was the following Tuesday. I came back to work that Wednesday.

At the funeral, Greg showed up. I was honestly surprised. He shook hands with my mom, said something about what a lovely service it was. Then he came over to me. There were maybe forty people still at the reception. He grabbed my hand in both of his, did that serious concerned face thing, and said ""I'm so sorry for your loss. Next time though, try not to abandon your team during a busy quarter. We really struggled without you.""

I felt like I'd been punched. I couldn't even respond. I just stood there while he patted my shoulder and walked away to get coffee.

Turns out my coworker Amy was standing behind us. She filmed the whole thing on her phone. I didn't know until I got back to work.

Amy pulled me aside that first day back and said ""I need to show you something."" She played the video. You can hear everything. Crystal clear. Greg's voice saying those exact words at my dad's funeral while I'm wearing a black dress and standing next to a table with my father's photo on it.

I still haven't watched it again. I can't.

Amy asked if she could send it to HR. I said yes. Then I went to the bathroom and threw up.

HR called me in on Friday. They said Greg claimed he never said that, that I must have misheard him because he would never be so insensitive. Then I mentioned the video. The HR woman's face went completely blank. She asked if she could see it.

She watched it twice. Didn't say anything. Just thanked me for coming in and said they'd ""handle it internally.""

Greg got a written warning. That's it. He's still my boss. He's still there every morning when I walk in. He won't make eye contact with me now but that's somehow worse.

My sister says I should quit. My mom says I should sue. Amy says she'll testify to anything if I need her to. But I keep thinking about how I only had one week of PTO and I used every single day of it and my dad still died and Greg thinks the biggest problem was quarterly sales targets.

I sent the video to three other people in the company. Not to HR. Just to people I trust. They've all seen it now. Word is spreading. Greg knows. He called me into his office yesterday and said ""I think we need to discuss your attitude lately and whether you're still a good fit for this team.""

I just looked at him and said ""My attitude?""

He backed down. Told me to forget it. But I know he's building a case to fire me now.

So now I'm sitting here wondering if I made this worse by letting people see that video. If I should have just kept my head down and moved on. My dad's been gone three weeks and I'm about to lose my job because I took a week to watch him die.

AITAH for spreading that video around the office?

As part of my job there, I teach classes to the public on coffee practices and history. Next month, I am teaching a class on home espresso setups. I have the basics written out and everything, but I would like to do a FAQ section of the class. Because I have been in the industry for so long, I don't know exactly what questions non-baristas might have. If you make espresso at home and have never worked in coffee, what are questions you have/had when you were just starting out? What information would you find most useful?

\- Basics of equipment  
\- Defining and understanding espresso

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.

Basically I’m looking for a hot espresso drink with foam. That’s essentially it. Latte has too much calories. Cappuccino kinda too. Americano is best with a splash of milk, but I’m missing the foam. Caffe misto is almost what I’m looking for, but uses brewed coffee instead (I guess I can just add espresso to it…).

But is there a caffe misto version but with espresso? I’m looking to stay under 100 calories which is so easy with cold drinks but a struggle with hot ones. I don’t care to add too much milk to the drink (splash is just fine) but I care about the frothy foam on top.

To be clear - this is not a shopping or tech question - I already own the items - I'm looking to get some opinions on how placement will impact the listening experience.

Here's the space:

https://preview.redd.it/o3eegb3k8o6g1.jpg?width=727&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=151d56395df89cf9ed92fd640c58852bc02f7ba2

12' x 28', 8.33' ceiling height, plaster walls

**Small red squares** = likely speaker locations  
**Big red squares** = potential subwoofer locations  
**Yellow arrows** = speaker direction  
**Green dots** = potential listening positions

The sofa has to stay where it is, as does the plant in the top corner. The coffee table is a hollow metal frame with a glass top, so not much of an obstruction, but the sofa definitely is (a cloud couch-style sectional). FWIW, at the bottom of the image is a wall with a large arch window, not a passage to another room.

The speakers are on stands and I think they will probably be fine on either side of the credenza (open to other suggestions though), but the sub I'm kinda lost on. It's my first sub and its pretty massive (for the space), which limits where it can fit. I'm not sure how obstructions like a couch impact a sub or the impact of a sub facing a different direction than the speakers. I noted where I think might be potential spots for the sub (A and B), with the numbers representing potential speaker direction.

Any thoughts on which of these configurations would be best? Would appreciate some perspectives.",1,1765500837.0,audiophile,1,1.0,False

His wife and I moved in together, and now he’s the one sleeping in his car","[[[didn’t know this would turn into such a long post when I started writing. just dumped everything that’s been going on in my head here. I know it might sound like some wild creative story, but trust me, this really happened to me 😭]]]

I’m 25, and for the last 2.5 years, I thought I was in a great relationship with “Adam,” who’s 31. It was the kinda relationship where you daydream about the future and like, write his last name after yours when you’re bored at work...

Now? Now, I’m living with his wife. Yeah, you read that right

We met on Hinge. His profile said “divorced, no kids” and “looking for something serious.” Our first date was, like, classic but cute. We went to a small bar with a pool table. He taught me how to shoot, even though I was already good at it. He put his hand on my waist. He walked me home, didn’t push for sex, and texted me to check if I got home safely, sending me pics of his cat. It was picture perfect.He was consistent. Sent good morning texts, made goodnight calls. He remembered my coffee order, came to my graduation, and cried when I got my first real job. My friends were, like, “This guy is a green flag.” I was that annoying girl in the group chat saying, “OMG, he’s actually emotionally available!!!”

But... I overlooked two “yellow flags”:

1. I’d never been to his place. He always gave some excuse: “It’s too far, it’s messy, my roommate’s got someone over”. We mostly stayed at my place or traveled together

2. He was weird about photos. We took pics together, but he never wanted to post any. He was be like, “my ex is crazy, I don’t want any drama”

I was just in love, okay? Just... so blissfully naïve

Then boom, reality hit me like a truck.

A new woman started at my job. We went for drinks after work, added each other on Insta, and while I was half asleep that night, I scrolled through her page. I stopped when I saw a wedding photo..😶‍🌫️

The groom looked JUST like my boyfriend🫢
At first, I laughed, then I zoomed in, and no way. Same jawline, same dimple. My mind went noooo. But then I swiped through the rest of the photos...
Same tattoo on his wrist Same watch I got him for his birthday. SAME EXACT MAN 🤯

The profile read: “my forever” “three years with my best friend"" “couldn’t have picked a better father for my kids” Kids. Plural
In a pic he was holding a newborn in a tiny pink hat. I checked the date, it overlapped with a weekend he said he was on a someone's trip. I felt like ice cold. The tunnel vision, when everything goes silent. That was me.

I clicked on her profile. The nickname is Jemima, 29. Her bio says: Wife ,mom of two, true crime & iced coffee. Her page was basically a scrapbook of their entire relationship/engagement/wedding/pregnancies/first steps/dinners. While I was getting supermarket flowers from him on a random day, they were having family photoshoots in matching outfits...Then, after that, I scrolled back to the day he first messaged me on Hinge. He started dating me before their second baby was even born. I was like WTF! 😳

I don’t even remember how long I sat on my bathroom floor just staring at my phone. I blocked him, then unblocked him, typed “how could you” and deleted it. I called my best friend but hung up before it rang. I felt sick. I cried. Then...?? something snapped inside me

If I was blindsided, she had to be too🤐

I stalked her page for 24 hours straight. No suspicious photos, no shady captions. Everything seemed like this boring, domestic happiness. He was living a double life like a freakin' pro. So I made a Google voice account and messaged her saying: jey, this sounds crazy but I promise I’m not trolling you. I think we... might be dating the same men”.I sent her a few photos: a selfie of us at my graduation where he’s kissing my cheek, and, a screenshot of our Hinge chat where he says, “I’ve been divorced for a year, my ex is crazy”

Shockingly, she replied within a minute: Call me. Right now. I couldn’t stop shaking, but I hit that green button She picked up on the first ring, no ""hello"", and said: How long? I said to her: just 2.5 years. Then? An awful silence and she broke down sobbing/gasping. She said they were married for 4 years, together for 7, with 2 kids under 3. She used to think, he was just working late, going to gym more, having extra shifts.

All those “late-night gym selfies?” they were just him in parking lot of Planet Fitness near their house. We spent 3 hours on the phone comparing dates/ restaurants/timelines. Then realized he literally copied everything. He took us to the same places, bought us the same cheap jewelery, and using same lines. She told me that she felt like her whole life was just a rental she had never signed up for.🥲 By the end of the call we weren’t crying anymore. We were both just… quiet. Numb. Angry in this very calm way. Then she asked, “Do you wanna blow up his life with me?”

I said yes

So we made a plan👁️

She invited him to a family dinner at her parents' house for her dad’s birthday. She told him to dress nice and not to be late. She texted me the address and time. I arrived 15 minutes early with a bottle of wine and printed screenshots of EVERYTHING. Her parents already knew what was going on. Her mom hugged me like I was family. Her dad looked like he wanted to commit murder.
When he pulled up, I was watching from the window. My heart was racing as if I were cheating-even though I was the one who was being cheated on. The liar just walked in, all charming, kissed his wife, greeted her parents.He did not notice me at first because I was sitting in the corner of the living room. Then Jemima said to him: “Adam, she is Jacqueline. You’ve been dating her for two and a half years”

He turned. Our eyes locked. I swear I saw his soul leave his body. He went pale. Then red. Then that weird color people get when they feel faint. He tried to laugh it off at first. “Babe, what is this? Some kind of joke?” He looked at me like I was supposed to play along. I just placed the stack of papers on the coffee table. Screenshots/photos,bank statements,hiis Hinge profile

Her dad looked at him asking him to settle down first to which he denied. Then he threw some story about how we “were on a break” when he met me. “Just friends,” he said calling me a stalker in front of her family.

That’s when I snapped

I pulled out my phone and played a voice note where he told me, just two days ago, that he couldn’t wait to finally move in together and feeling stuck in a dead marriage with a roommate. Jemima just stared at him, not shouting, just... disappointed. It was like watching a stranger wearing her husband’s face. Her dad said, “Go get your things. My daughter will pack what she wants. You have ten minutes to leave my house”. He tried to plead, cry, and grab jemina. Her mom stepped between them.

I grabbed my keys and left because I was shaking so badly and I didn’t want to hear him say my name again. I thought that was the end of it. I went home. Blocked him on everything. Sat on my bed and stared at the wall and wondered how I was going to explain to my friends that my “green-flag-guy” was just a liar.

Then Jemima texted me: “I kicked him out. I’m filing tomorrow. I don’t want to be alone with two kids and a mortgage. Do you... want a roommate?”

She was dead serious

I said yes

So now I live in the spare room of the house he was paying for. I give her money for rent and groceries, help with the kids, and we’ve built this weird little alliance out of the ruins of his double life. People keep asking if I’m okay and I don’t know how to answer. Some days I feel like a homewrecker. Some days I feel like I accidentally rescued a stranger from a burning building I helped light.

Here’s the part I haven’t told anyone in my real life: I’m starting to have feelings for Jemima. Not in a “haha let’s trauma bond and joke about being wives” way ,but, in a very real/inconvenient way. We stay up late talking about everything. She falls asleep on the couch with her head on my shoulder. She texts me memes all day, steals my hoodies, makes my coffee exactly how I like it without asking. The first time I saw her in scrub pants and a messy bun, wrangling a toddler on her hip, I had this intrusive thought of “I’d marry you and never lie to you I don’t even know what my label is. I never questioned my sexuality before. I dated men. I loved him. Now I look at his wife and think, “You were the upgrade all along.” I’m not doing anything about it. She’s freshly separated, grieving the life she thought she had. I’m the other woman who wasn’t supposed to exist. The last thing she needs is me complicating it further.

So I’m just here. Living in the house my ex lied his way into, helping his wife rebuild a life that never should’ve been broken, learning how to make dinosaur-shaped pancakes for kids who call me “jacqueline” and think I’m just there mom’s friend. Sometimes we are just sitting on the couch, kids finally asleep, Netflix humming in the background, and she looks over and says, “Thank you for telling me. I’m glad it was you.”

I needed to put this somewhere because it feels too insane to be real and too heavy to keep in my head. No one in my real life knows the full story. To my friends, I just “found out he was cheating.” To her family, I’m “the girlfriend.” Only she and I know every ugly detail.

(my deepest gratitude if you have really honestly read this far!!! Hugs!!! (⁠个⁠_⁠个⁠))

TL;DR: Dated a guy for 2.5 years. Found out through Instagram that he’s married with two kids. His wife and I compared timelines and confronted him at a “family dinner.” We kicked him out and moved in together as roommates. Now he’s couch-surfing, and I’m slowly developing feelings for the woman he lied to us both about ",1,1765500812.0,TwoHotTakes,2,0.6,False

He agreed to stop posting, but he’s still doomscrolling constantly. I’m not sure what to do. (29F) (32 M)","Hi everyone! Thanks for taking the time to read iver what's going on in my world. 

TL;DR: My boyfriend posted extreme political content during a mental-health spiral. Friends/family were alarmed and it could impact my career. He agreed to stop posting but still doomscrolls the same extreme content. He says it feels like self-harm. Our relationship is otherwise great, but this issue feels huge and unresolved. What do I do?

I’m 29F and my boyfriend (32M) has recently went through a phase of posting very extreme political content on Facebook, bordering on sesxist, racist, conspiracy-heavy, aggressive, and honestly alarming. Not normal disagreements, but the type of posts that made multiple friends message me privately asking if he was okay.

To be clear, our relationship is genuinely good in most ways. He’s supportive, funny, loyal, affectionate, and very emotionally present with me. He's the guy who remembers your grandma's birthday and wakes you up with coffee in bed. We communicate well, laugh a lot, and day-to-day life with him is great. This isn’t a “my entire relationship is awful” story — it’s that one issue has become big enough that it’s affecting everything around it. He was NOT always like this. It began post COVID after side effects with the vaccine. He ended up with major health issues, can't work and it basically isolated with only himself the dog and his phone while I work 2 jobs to support us.

For context: I work in healthcare/education/alongside law enforcement and supervise university students. My online presence matters, I am WELL known in my area with a good reputation for my skills
 His Facebook is linked to mine, and people in my field can easily find me through him. His posts absolutely did not reflect well on me professionally nor are they in line with my own beliefs. Especially when it comes to background checks for clearances.

My friends and family noticed too:

A close friend confronted me, saying the posts were alarming, attacking him verbally and implying Im a bad person for staying.

My grandma literally argued with him over it and is also terrified for my overall wellbeing

Others said they were worried about his mental state. 

I finally brought it up. I explained the posts affect my career, people think he’s unstable, it’s embarrassing and stressful for me and he seems worse mentally when he’s on social media He wasn’t angry, just defensive at first. I asked if he’d consider deleting Facebook entirely since it clearly isn’t good for him or our social lives. He said he wouldn’t delete it, but he would stop posting and to his credit, he has.

But here’s the thing:
He’s still scrolling the same extreme videos, links, and feeds. He’s still watching the same creators, consuming the same content, and getting Emotionally worked up by it. He's still prepping for when the government collapses (wanting to go off grid, lots of emergency food). So the behaviour didn’t stop. Only the visible part stopped.

He also told me, very honestly, that posting and consuming that content felt like self-harm something he did when mentally spiraling even though he knew it made him feel worse. He's AuDH and addiction prone and he feels a dopamine release watching extreme content.
Hearing that made me even more worried. It made me see the whole issue not as politics but as a symptom of something deeper.

Now I’m sitting with anxiety about my career, riends/family who now see him VERY differently, his admission that the behaviour was “self-harm-like”and the fact that nothing has really changed underneath, he's doing the same behaviours just less visable. And yet, a relationship that is otherwise loving and solid I don’t want to control him. I don’t care about political alignment. This isn’t about politics  it’s about extremeness, mental health, and the consequences landing on me too.

This is what Im wondering:

1. Should I see stopping the posting as “good enough? 

2. Should I try to get him to stop consuming the content too even though it feels like ot would take an ultimatum

3. I've encouraged psychedelic therapy as it's worked for him in the past. He's refusing all mental health care if he has to pay for it. Im willing to use my benefits or pay myself but he seems disinterested in getting help/does not recognise other people's worries for him. Even my own psychiatrist is worried enough she's offered to prescribe meds for him. If he doesnt get help what the hell do I do?

4. Should I view this as a deeper incompatibility I’m avoiding because I love him. I DONT want to leave but I do want a family and dont want them growing up like this. He's my best friend I've known him most of my life and he got me through hell and back

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot c.l.a.i.m of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Main issues are joint hyper mobility, some arthritis in my feet (bunions, not severe as evaluated by doctors) scoliosis, tight ham strings, ME/CFS.

I've had foot pain all my life. Genuinely wondering if I had juvenile arthritis that wasn't picked up on, but I'll find out when I finally get seen by rheumatology (I've been waiting on the NHS for 2 years for an appointment)
I've always been very sensitive to getting plantar fasciitis in either foot, of course pain is a bit worse in my dominant side.
I'm trying to understand how my symptoms are changing, because I think it's getting worse. 

Today I was up from 9am, left home after 10, out all day until getting home at 5:30pm. An hour before getting home I was really dreading getting back because my feet were getting incredibly sore. It's hard to explain, it's a general aching pressure and constant pain just generally in my entire two feet. The majority of my day was sitting down either on trains, buses, on my rollator, in coffee shops. I always take lots of breaks which helps but it's seeming that my pain is coming back faster now even with breaks.
My feet swell a little bit but not much. Compression socks help me with stamina at the beginning of the day but they don't help very much with pain later. I know this probably isn't normal, like I said my pain has increased.

I'm also just trying to wrap my head around not having foot pain? If that's possible, if people can really work day jobs on their feet and not have to spend all night with them up to recover.

I'm getting a wheelchair eventually and I'm looking forward to having it indoors just so that if it's a day I go out and walk and my feet hurt then at least I'm not stuck in bed for the rest of the evening.

I have always wanted a family but the first step is finding a man I want to marry - that has not happened yet haha. I am aware that it’s not looking good for me at this age, but I always believe in keeping options open so I am wanting to do IVF egg harvesting and freezing, which also has the benefit of being able to use an embryo that is not BRCA1 if the time ever came. So for now, I am wanting to do IVF, remove ovaries and tubes but keep uterus. Also am in the process of double mastectomy with reconstruction, however am having trouble making decisions that come with that to be able to progress.

These reason I want to get ovaries and tubes removed ASAP is because there is no screening available at all for gynae cancer. I lost my dad to cancer when I was 19 and the next year I came home one night to my mum in absolute agony; took her to emergency and they gave her pain relief and an ultrasound which showed a coffee cup sized ‘cyst’ on her ovary which had twisted, which caused the pain. Sent her home with surgery likely to be scheduled in a few months. Luckily she had private health insurance and got it removed within a week - stage 1A ovarian cancer, it was fully encapsulated but a highly aggressive type and I remember some talk about how she was lucky to get it removed before it ruptured.

Even though it was diagnosed stage1A and she underwent full chemotherapy after the surgery, it still came back, so this makes me certain I want out of my ovaries ASAP but keep my uterus and harvest eggs as I am not yet certain I will never meet someone and want to have children.

These are some of the things I am feeling unsure of overall and thought I would post on here incase anyone has any experience or opinions that may help:

\- I received pricing information on IVF (South Australia). It has 2 sections - 1 standard IVF and 1 medically necessary IVF. The cost of 1 cycle of egg harvesting is about $4,900 for standard IVF.

In the medically necessary IVF, it says 1 round of egg harvesting is about $10,900, Medicare will pay about $4,500 towards it because it is medically necessary, so cost for patient is about $4,400 per cycle.

So in the end, the price is nearly doubled for it being medically necessary, they get money from the government and it ends up costing me a few hundred less than if it wasn’t medically necessary. This sounds like a scam where they get paid twice instead of patients being subsidised for medical 🤦‍♀️

\- the cost is stressing me out and i am not sure how many cycles I would actually need after account for the amount of eggs lost to genetic defects and having enough eggs to end in a full term pregnancy as I know it is not a situation where you put 1 egg in the uterus and VOILA, baby lol. Does anyone have any experience where they could shed light on how many cycles I should do if I wanted an enough eggs where I could likely have 2-3 pregnancies?

\- breast mastectomy and reconstruction:

I told the surgeon I am wanting an implant reconstruction over the muscle as I want as natural a result as possible and I know that natural movement is better when not placed under muscle.

I have been tasked with deciding between also removing my nipple or preserving it, also choosing what implant I want before next appointment.

\- I am looking online and have come across an implant called ‘ergonomix 2’ by Motiva. From their website, it looks as if it take on a more tear drop form when upright and then flattens/rounds out when laying down as a natural breast may do. It looks like the shell is also not textured like the teardrop implant I was shown in the hospital which I am told has a 1/10,000 risk of causing lymphoma. This has drawn me to this implant but I have not seen it in person. Has anyone got any feedback on this implant?

I also would like an implant that is as soft and squishy as possible, as my boobs are very soft and it concerns me having a hard lump in my chest.

The surgeon also offered to do fat transfer at a later date if needed.

Does anyone have any recommendations on the best implant to use? Feedback on what they have used? Those who have had fat transfer, how did that  go for you?

But do I pass to someone's grandma who calls the PlayStation a Nintendo? Hell yeah I do 🔥😎 slay queen! 💅 But hey, maybe I'm just projecting 🤷‍♀️

It's an interesting topic, because I think our community does not have a collective agreement on what 'passing' means and how that changes based on the environment we are in.

Jacob watched the lifters pulling the freight containers from the levtrain and repressed a sigh. He’d thought he and Anders had established something of a rapport over the last couple of weeks, but in the aftermath of the retreat from X-ray, she had become almost robotic. She ignored the busy station and the milling crowds as though they were invisible.

“How many are there a day?” he asked, just to try and get a conversation going.

Anders followed his gaze and sighed. “It depends, usually four lines are running constantly, but five and six can be brought on as needed,” she replied.

The levtrains ran up and down the tethers from Bayl station that formed the space ladder and brought the wealth of the planet up into orbit. He’d seen the pictures, glittering ribbons that flexed and swayed, reaching down from the disc of the space station to Anchorage, far below them on the surface.

“It’s time. Come on, Jacob.” Anders left a handful of chits on the table and finished her coffee before standing and smoothing her naval shipsuit over her curving hips. She stared down at him impatiently.

He drained his beer; he wasn’t a Proccie, so he didn’t feel the need to refrain from a refreshing ale over lunch before the big briefing with the lord high too-ta-loo. The slightly bitter taste behind the fruity overtones was pleasant. He made a note to order a few barrels of the stuff for *Humility*. Jacob followed Anders as they left the cafe next to the tether station and headed into the maze of corridors that made up the industrial section of the station.

Being so much smaller than Killie, this station used grav generators to counteract zero G rather than centrifugal force, making Bayl a large, orbital hockey puck with a webwork of docking and storage gantries reaching up beyond it, away from the planet below. *Humility* was floating off to one side of Bayl at the moment, receiving the considerable material support Jacob had requisitioned off the back of his letter of marque. His *Archon* was going to be *very* well armed the next time he took her into combat.

The use of artificial gravity also meant that the damn place was a warren of tunnels, elevators and stairs. Anders knew the way; otherwise, Jacob would have had to access maps on his wristpad every few minutes. They stepped into an elevator, and it swished closed behind them.

“So they’ve cracked her open, then?” he asked. Maybe focusing on work was the right tack to take to break through the distance that had appeared between them.

“The jacks were implanted in the prisoner’s frontal lobes yesterday afternoon. They’ve downloaded most of her sense-memories. She burned out at one AM, station time. A team worked through the night to analyse them while another group dissected the body for any physical clues.” Cool, calm, disinterested. Like Anders was discussing the weather, not the violation of a woman’s mind.

“Have you heard anything more than that? Any hint about what the hell they are?” he asked, unable to suppress his excitement at finding out more about the first living alien species humanity had ever encountered.

There was no doubt as to the intelligence of the aliens. Setting aside the yellow giant, the smaller creatures had established a perimeter around the gate, vigorously repelling the tentative probes the Proccie Marines had sent at them as a form of first contact. The no-go zone was now fifty miles across and growing slowly. At the heart of the infestation, around the ring itself, strange structures had been built, or more likely *grown*, based on the video Jacob had seen.

Fungal and grey. Delicate arches joined the weird domes together into a complex network that blocked out the sun from the ground. The sensor distortion had spiked yesterday, and now orbital scans provided very little information beyond the extent of the spread. A tumour was expanding on the surface of Nastor.

“It will probably be shared in the briefing, Jacob.”

“You’re Proccie special forces, and they haven’t given you anything more than that?” Jacob asked in surprise.

“The Harpies are just another unit; we do, or ought to, get better gear than most, though. Otherwise, we’re just another piece on the board,” she said bitterly.

Jacob let the conversation lapse into an uncomfortable silence. The lift pinged as they arrived thirty floors above where they started, and Anders once again led the way. They were stopped regularly—guards wearing sidearms and suspicious faces, and scan-locked doors becoming more common—as Anders guided them deeper into the Protectorate outpost on Bayl.

“Lieutenant Anders and Privateer Asgar, reporting for briefing with Commander Hibbot.” Anders saluted, then offered her wrist pad to the guard who ran a sensor wand over it.

“Go ahead, the commander is in a bit of a fit, though, just so you’re aware,” the guard said softly as he tapped at his own wristpad, and the door to his side slid open quietly. He gave them a tentative smile as they passed, his blue eyes gleaming with humour that Jacob couldn’t understand. Beyond was a simple waiting room, devoid of all decoration except for a single holo on the wall that showed Bayl Station slowly spinning against a backdrop of stars.

Anders took a seat, back ramrod straight, hands resting in her lap, and her eyes locked on the opposite wall. Jacob slouched, his dark shipsuit scrunching up around his waist as he sprawled out in the uncomfortable chair.

“I preferred Harrow’s waiting room,” he grumbled good-naturedly, looking around the drab compartment.

“Madame-Secretary Harrow is at the administrative level. She deals with corpo CEOs and Cultist High Priests on a daily basis. This is a purely military installation. We don’t do frills, doilies, and comfy sofas.” Was that a tiny hint of a half-smile on the corner of her lips? Jacob couldn’t be sure.

“See, that’s why I prefer the independent life,” he said with a shrug.

She turned her head to face him, her expression serious. “Jacob, a lot of us aren’t lucky enough to inherit a ship, a Ritter, and the germ of a loyal crew. Most of us just get our jacks and the family core: that’s it. We both know exactly how much use jacks and a core are without a ship and a mech, don’t we?”

“Keeping all that shit going isn’t cheap,” he grumbled, and Anders raised a single eyebrow at him. Her short, pink hair had been slicked back into military smoothness, and the dishevelled spikes he’d grown familiar with were missing. “So I guess I can understand why a lot of us sign up with the Proccies. Is that why you joined? Stuck with a useless core and nothing else?” He tried to sympathise, but his entire life had been built around his father's success as an independent agent. What seemed normal to him might be beyond the wildest dreams of some people.

“No. My family has been part of the service for generations. I grew up as a Proccie, but you don’t know how lucky you were to get *Humility*. I’ve worked with some indies who signed on, though.” Jacob felt an odd mixture of sympathy and disgust.

Having experienced, albeit briefly, the difficulty of finding work as an independent mercenary and balancing his budget, he could understand wanting all of that hassle to go away. But giving up his freedom? Being told where to go and what to stomp? That wasn’t something he, or his father before him, could countenance.

“I guess,” he mumbled. It hadn’t felt like luck. He’d got a light mech, a ship and crew, plus the endless joy of paying for their upkeep. Hitting twenty-two, losing his dad to neurojack burnout, and finding himself up to his eyeballs in outgoing expenses had not been fun.

Anders glanced at her wrist and stood. “He’s ready for us.” She approached the door, and it slid aside as she approached. Jacob followed into a large office, equally as austere as the waiting room. A large, oval desk occupied the centre of it. Two men in navy blue Proccie shipsuits rose to their feet and nodded as Anders saluted them. A rotund man in similar, but much more badly fitting clothing, just looked up from where he sat. Behind him, a viewport showed the spiderweb of metal that comprised the station docks, the sun and stars glittering in the distance.

“Sit,” the fat man commanded, looking down at the flimscreen on his desk and resuming typing. “Lieutenant Anders, Mr Asgar, I present Major Dubrev, of Fleet, and Captain Ito, who leads our Marine detachment. Major Dubrev, if you’d like to begin.”

Thank you, Commander Hibbot.” The viewscreen dissolved, and an aerial view of site X-ray appeared, the growing stain of the aliens turning an irregular blob of the surface a stark grey in comparison to the dusty red of the rest of the land around it. “As you can see, the rate of the xenos expansion is… impressive, but has now stabilised. An area roughly a hundred miles in diameter is now completely under their control, and the fungal structures are beginning to creep into the quarantine zone.”

“Why have they stopped?” asked Jacob when Dubrev paused for breath.

“Unknown, Mr Asgar. Our best guess is to consolidate their gains and bring in further reinforcements from whatever lies beyond the gate.”

“Do we have any information on that at all, sir?” Anders asked respectfully.

“We do. Before Lissbeth Garcia succumbed to the burnout, the neurojacks our technicians temporarily implanted were able to retrieve a great deal of her memories, going back several years.”

Jacob shuddered at what they had done to the woman. Forcible implantation and algorithmically stripping her memories via neurojacks that her body was incapable of accepting, killing her as a result.

“This appears to be a long-brewed scheme, and stretches up into the coreworlds corps. Lissbeth was not aware of who was funding and supplying Magco, beyond Vargo Industries and possibly the Floater clans in-system, but she concluded based on a number of technical devices she saw and used, that galaxy-scale mega-corps were backing the project, and I am inclined to agree with her conclusions,” Dubrev concluded.

The viewscreen shifted, showing an exploded diagram of the ring structure. It made no sense to Jacob beyond obvious things, such as energy conduits and heat sink installations.

“This is the design, pieced together from deep scans performed by *Humility* two days ago, subsequent passes by Navy cutters before the fungal growth blocked orbital observation, and the memories reclaimed from Miss Garcia.” By ‘reclaimed,’ Jacob knew the man meant ‘mind-raped.’ “Our technicians are still baffled by much of it, but having seen it put into action, a lot of high probability inferences can be made.” He paused and took a deep breath before continuing.

“This is a portal designed to tear through space. Some of its elements are similar enough to our jump drives that we can get a decent read on their function. Normally, a jump drive exploits a loophole in spacetime called ‘the Aurthurian Rule,’ essentially confusing reality into thinking two places are the same. By being inside the volume of this conjoining, the ship exists in both places at once and is able to ‘choose’ which one it would like to actually be in. The arrays in the ring perform a similar function, but we are confident that the intended merging was not within our universe.”

“Wouldn’t it be simpler if it were just linking to some faraway place rather than stepping outside of reality?” Jacob asked.

“That was our initial theory. That the gate was simply a stable translation field, something that’s also impossible as far as we’re aware, by the way, but it isn’t. Miss Garcia was privy to meetings in which the overall goal was discussed.” He crossed his arms and scowled at the screen. “They wanted to break into a refuge, the mad bastards.”

“Language, Major,” snapped Hibbot without looking up.

“Apologies, sir. Miss Garcia’s memories were rather muddled on the details; she was a superconductor specialist, not an astromath, but from the conversations she was privy to, a number of previous alien structures, all of which were unknown to the Protectorate, had led their backers to the sites on Nastor, and the Kadath ruins were the final key they needed to open the lock.”

“When people go into a refuge, they generally don’t want to be disturbed, sir, but the response from the xenos has been a bit stronger than a ‘leave me alone,’” Anders said slowly. “This looks more like an invasion than a defensive move.”

“We believe they had been misled as to the nature of the beings on the other side,” Dubrev said drily. “The Master in Yellow was the focus of their obsession. Apparently, it was an ancient being who would provide technological wonders to any race that could reach it in seclusion.”

“That big yellow bastard!” Jacob snapped. Hibbot looked up and scowled, but Jacob just smiled sweetly. He wasn’t in the portly Proccie’s chain of command. The perks of being independent.

“Indeed. And no, we do not know where the being went after it left the gate site. It vanished from all our sensors before it left the atmosphere.”

“I want to give *Humility* another shot at him,” Jacob grumbled.

“We will not be moving in force until the *Jackal* and her escorts arrive, at the very earliest. If there is no significant change in the xenos’ deployment at that time, we will again hold until reinforcements can be brought up from Lastor, Killie Station, and the belt settlements,” said Hibbot, pushing aside his flimscreen.

“That’s insane! Waiting for the *Jackal*, fine, I guess. But not using her drone squadrons and the beams on the destroyers when they get here is stupid! It’s a disease, and it killed a bunch of your Marines!” Jacob snapped. Anders flinched ever so slightly as Hibbot fixed Jacob with a glare.

“Allow Major Dubrev to finish his briefing, *Mr* Asgar,” Hibbot said testily.

“We are also coordinating with the on-planet corps on two separate fronts. In addition to bringing their various militarised wings under Protectorate command, there is the issue of the civilians. News has spread quickly, despite our attempts to contain the information.”

“You can’t stop the signal,” muttered Jacob with a wry smile.

“We thought we’d have done a better job of it, to be honest,” said Dubrev with a shrug, “but the web moves quickly, and reports went out faster than we could quash them. The levtrains briefly ground to a halt as passenger slots were bought and traded at exorbitant prices, and mobs formed at stations demanding to flee to Anchorage.”

“We’ve got it under control now,” said Captain Ito. “But it’s meant my people are spread thin at the moment.”

“Vargo Industries has abandoned the city. We captured some of their leadership, but the CEO, CFO, and Technical Lead all vanished, along with a sizable chunk of their armed forces. They debunked for Continuity and have joined up with the bulk of Magco’s forces,” Dubrev resumed. “It’s a mess.”

“That is putting it lightly,” grumbled Hibbot. “Six fists of Ritters dug in like ticks, and backed by heavy infantry, armour, and artillery.”

“Thirty-six Ritters? What classes are they, sir?” asked Anders, looking to Dubrev.

“Mostly *Crab*s and *Lance*s, but each fist is led by a *Jupiter*. It isn’t all bad news. Browning, Jones-Moffet, who have a disturbing number of military assets that we hadn’t been aware of, and the Hansa League have all agreed to pass operational control of their assets to us, which gives us an extra three fists of light Ritters. They are currently stationed around the three-hundred-mile exclusion zone, with our own ready to deploy from Carryalls based on Bayl.”

“Dubrev, even with Anders’s *Werewolf*, that’s not a fair fight if we pull them all together,” Jacob said, running a hand back over his buzzcut.

“We’re spread thin, but we need to deal with the viper in our bed before we can focus on the tiger outside the front door. This is where you and Lieutenant Anders come in, privateer.”

“You aren’t rich enough to send me in against thirty-six Ritters, even *with* Anders at my side,” Jacob snapped.

“Respectfully, sir, I don’t want to fight corpo mechs. I believe the best use of Mr Asgar and my own capabilities is to be assigned to a unit monitoring the exclusion zone,” Anders added. Jacob nodded. He’d rather have a skirmish with the xenos than try to take a fortified city with six fists of mechs waiting inside.

“You will do as you are ordered, *Lieutenant*,” snapped the commander. Imagine being bossed around by assholes like this every day. Jacob sent his friend a sympathetic look, who continued to stare respectfully at Dubrev.

“You will not be alone. A Marine strike team will accompany you, and it will be a combined operation. Bayl’s drones will support those from the *Humility*, and you will have armour and artillery at your disposal as well. If necessary, limited orbital strikes from the KEWs that your engineering officer, Mr Cooper, is currently installing aboard the *Humility* will be authorised, but I am reserving operational release on that technology against human settlements.”

“Bullshit.” Jacob earned another scowl from Hibbot. “If I’ve got them and I need them, I’ll use them. I won’t just drop them casually, but she’s *my* ship.” Goddamn all military bureaucracies to hell. Anders laid a hand on his leg under the table and shot him a warning glance. He patted the back of her hand before she moved it back to her lap and gave her his warmest smile.

“You will have launch control,” admitted Hibbot with a grimace. “However, the consequences for using such destructive weaponry against a target with a substantial civilian population will be severe if you act unwisely.”

“You didn’t complain about *Humility* firing on the portal.” Jacob leaned back and crossed his arms, meeting Hibbot glare for glare.

“Lieutenant Anders argued strongly in your defence at the tribunal,” Dubrev said. “And in the circumstances, the unsanctioned use of an orbit-to-ground attack was deemed acceptable.”

“What fucking tribunal?” Jacob snarled.

“Language! You may not be one of my officers, but you can at least try to meet the standard of behaviour necessary in a member of the Protectorate!” Hibbot snapped, his jowls shaking as his cheeks flushed red. Jacob spotted Ito suppressing a smirk in the corner of his eye. “You were exonerated after the necessary investigation. Deploying orbital beam weapons against the surface of a Protectorate planet is not something we take lightly.”

So he’d been put on trial, without his knowledge, no less, while carrying out a mission under a letter of marque? *Fucking Proccies,* he mentally sneered.

“In addition to the squishies and some drones, what else will we have? It still doesn’t look like a fair fight on paper to me,” Jacob asked, forcing his voice to be calm.

“A fist of Protectorate *Carbine*s will deploy in support of your strike. A Carryall will drop them after your orbital insertion,” Ito said. “And those squishies are my boys and girls, *merc*.”

“So six medium Ritters. Unjacked trash.”

“Jacob, those pilots are well-trained and well-equipped. They’ll be putting their lives on the line to support us,” Anders said quickly.

“Against thirty-bloody-six. Sure, they’re unjacked too, unless Largo or Hollister are running with Magco now?” Jacob asked in a slightly gentler tone.

“Miss Hollister and Mr Largo are both on Lastor and unavailable at this time. Requests have been sent with the offer of a generous retainer, should either of them choose to put aside their feud and work with us against this new threat. For now, they are off the board,” Dubrev said.

Jacob turned to Anders, and she looked back at him. Her green eyes were solemn, the sadness from losing her Marines lingering in them, her mask slipping as she gave him a haunted look. He held her gaze for a moment and nodded firmly, earning a half-smile from the woman.

“OK. But I want the Proccie forces under Anders's direct command. I don’t care how many shiny badges some rank-climber has; she runs your side of the show,” he said to Hibbot.

“That was already part of the plan,” Dubrev muttered to prevent an outburst from the station commander. “So you’ll drop against Magco?”

“I will,” Jacob ground out. It was shitty odds, against the wrong enemies, but he’d be fighting by the *Werewolf*’s side again.

They left the briefing after some formalities that Jacob grunted his way through monosyllabically, then headed back out towards the elevator, planning to return to *Humility* immediately.

“You shouldn’t antagonise them, Jacob,” Anders said as the lift doors closed and they were once more safely away from prying ears.

“Tibbot’s a typical REMF who hasn’t seen his dick in ten years, Kell. You think he gives a shit about the people you lost at X-ray beyond the amount of paperwork it meant he had to fill out?”

Anders grimaced at the reminder. “They were doing their jobs,” she said softly. “They loved their work.”

“I love killing things and breaking shit as much as the next guy, but we were thrown in at the deep end, and then we get a bloody tribunal as a reward? It’s a joke. I’m all for getting some payback on the aliens, I just don’t think we need Proccie help to do it. The pair of us in our Ritters, we are the power here, Anders, not Hibbot.”

“In a couple of days, we’ll get the first jumpdrone back from Lasega. I’d expect much of their garrison to follow over the next fortnight. That will include *Trident* and her escorts. She’s got six fists of mediums and heavies, Jacob. Within two months, the reaction force from Valour Station in Helstat will arrive here. That’s half a dozen cruisers and two heavy carriers. We are not the power here. We’re just the bit of power that’s here *right now*.”

They exited the lift and walked in silence through the corridors, keeping their distance from passersby. *At least I cracked through her shell,* Jacob thought ruefully. She was still cool and distant, but her fierce green eyes no longer had that vacant element that had made her seem so changed after the drop on X-ray and the arrival of the xenos.

As they left the station behind, Jacob reactivated his jacks, reached out to connect to *Humility* on the approach, ignoring the awe-inspiring sight of the station drifting away behind them. Once he was connected, he ran a systems check on his ship.

The KEW racks were in place, and Coop was busy integrating them. They would deploy from dorsal ports similar to those the drones used. The two-ton arrows of tungsten would be launched on drop drives to boost them into the atmosphere, and then gravity would do the rest.

High precision and capable of delivering blasts equivalent to nuclear weapons, they were the most dangerous upgrade *Humility* had ever received in her centuries of active duty. KEWs were nearly as strictly controlled as actual atomic bombs, which had been outlawed since Tau Ceti got sterilised during the Founding War. Not even the Proccies were meant to have them on hand.

Jacob’s eyes drifted as he followed a freighter being approached by a tug in the distance. The fusion reactor in that ship, or *Humility* for that matter, was more dangerous than any nuke. If *Humility* dove down onto Nastor's surface like an oversized, silvery egg and blew her core just before impact, she could kill everything for hundreds of miles.

That growing wound on the planet, full of ravening alien monstrosities, could be wiped out in a heartbeat. No more giant quadrupeds, or the nasty acid-spitting bipeds. Those dog-like monsters could never run down and savage another man or woman again. The recordings from the Marines that had been caught by the low-slung aliens had been horrific.

He didn’t like these fatalistic thoughts. They weren’t so badly off yet that anything like that would be necessary. They’d crush Magco and their Vargo lackeys, then deploy the combined might of the corporations, *Humility and* the escort carrier *Jackal’s* fleet to swipe that cancerous stain off the face of Nastor and shove those aliens back into whatever universe they came from.

As they stepped off the shuttle, Anders rested a hand on his shoulder for a moment. “Whatever happens, Asgar. I’ll have your back.” As she turned away, it occurred to him that he hadn’t even considered the possibility of betrayal by the Proccies.",1,1765500370.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

i walked in today after school to my sister (who lives in the basement) heating water to cook some type of 2 minute ramen i bought. after she yelled at me for taking her clothes (after i confronted her about going into my room, my safe space, and eating my food)

i caught her. she had the package open already (this was her second one. she already had one. i made one yesterday for myself and one for my dad because hes ill right now and doesnt feel like eating or cooking. 5 come in a pack. so if you do the math it leaves one left. i confronted her. she didnt ask, apologize, offer to pay, or do any of that. shes 21 and im 15. one time she asked me to buy her one, so i did. but its a long walk so i usually go after work if i can (i work once a week on tuesdays)

she said i gave her extras because she already bought one (she didnt tell me) and her reasoning was that i took her clothes sometimes (i havent done that since our last fight on november 18th, its dec 11 right now. almost a full month.) so i feel like she just wants a reason to be mad at me so she can take my food. its not even about the food (its like $3 for a pack of five) its that she didnt ask, didnt apologize. she just has this ""whatever"" attitude. i told my mom and she told me to tell dad (this was all infront of my sister who seemed unbothered) my dad said this was between me and my sister. i tried to raise my voice but it started cracking. she just doesnt listen when i have a problem with her. im actually thinking about cutting her off. sure having that attitude is great. but shes destroying our relationship. i started raising my voice more and admiditly calling her names, but it was mostly like ""why are you being a b\*tch dude"" and my parents agree. she was being one. she told me i was acting like a piece of shit so now she deserves it (the food). so shes taking it to make a point. (shes 21. she can drive to the store and pick it up herself. she makes more money than me. she gets more tips and works more than once a week. shes also not in school.) she said even if she was mad she wouldnt be acting like this. i said ""acting like what? how am i acting"" and she wouldnt answer me. she decided to make pasta instead and ill admit i was being kind of an asshole. she was like ""i bought some that one time"" and i said ""wow thats a great step up im so proud of you! it mustve been so scary!"" but it doesnt give her the right to take my food. (mind you, it would be different if she gave some to me, she didnt.)

she brought up how I told my mom i wanted her evicted, which was true. i didnt want her homeless. i just wanted peace. my mom agrees that shes a pain to live with. she has had to / wants to put a lock on all her doors so that my sister stops taking stuff from our rooms. she wanted to put a lock on the basement door so she can only leave through the garage (theres stairs in the garage leading to the basement) but my dad says its not feasible because she doesnt have a kitchen sink down there (my other 3 sisters lived there at one point, never had a sink. they were either respectful and cleaned dishes up here, cooked for us and spent time with us, or washed their dishes in the bathroom sink or bathtub.) anyways, she says since i told my mom i wanted her evicted, she gets the ramen for compensation.

for more context i think im autistic or have autistic traits. im not diagnosed so i dont want to say that i have it, i do have a lot of traits such as taking things literally, not knowing social ques, not holding eye contact, stimming (running up and down the halls frantically when im excited, bored, frustrated, nervous, anxious, etc.) sometimes i dont even know im doing it. i mask in public and feel fatigue if im doing it too much. i have a strong sense of justice too.

so she finished making pasta instead of ramen. i asked her to put away the ramen she already opened in a container. she said ""nope. you can do that :)"" and went back downstairs. i was so mad i was shaking, i wanted to either cry or punch a wall. my mom saw how it affected me and she put it away for me. my dad says i cant control what she does. which seems like he wants me to just deal with it. all of the solutions weve came up with so far doesnt work because she just doesnt care.

i told my oldest sister about it, who moved out. she said it was abusive on my sisters part. (but its kind of a buzzword from her, so i wanted second opinions!!)

my dad saw me crying over it and kind of laughed. he refuses to do anything about it. i just really dont think he understands the situation, this has been going on for a while.

i know the best solution is to hide my food. but i dont want to draw bugs to my room. plus she goes in there when i ask her not to anyways. i really dont like having my space cluttered. it makes me feel like i cant breathe. and i just feel like it shouldnt be too much to ask to store my food in the kitchen so that someone who doesnt even live in this part of the house wont steal my food.

(more context. she lives in the basement, she has a huge bedroom (and access to the garage), another spare bedroom, a bathroom, 2 storage rooms connected to her room (one she uses as a walk in closet) and her own kitchen. (table, coffee maker, microwave, plates and bowls, cooking utensils, oven, and a fridge. the last fight we had she ended it by saying ""okay then lets stop taking each others stuff and stop talking. cuz clearly theres no solution except for me to get kicked out. so lets just ignore each other completely"" (after i told her we dont have to do that if she just apologizes and stops) (yes i did take her clothes but i asked most of the time and returned them. sometimes she will give me clothes she doesnt want and sees me wearing it and goes ""those are mine give them back!"" (im the youngest of 5, all my clothes are hand me downs)

so aitah?

im so sorry if this is written weirdly, my brain is a whole jumble of words right now. ill clarify anything you guys need in the comments! i can see how im a bit of an a-hole for this but i feel like im justified. this also isnt new for her, shes been like this since she was little. but she doesnt seem to care as long as im the one doing the confronting. thank you so much for taking the time to read my little rant, i know it was a long one. id love to know everyones thoughts in the comments. (sorry for bad grammar. im better at typing on mobile.)

Edit one: just to clarify + add stuff, shes been going into my room and moving stuff around, using my chair and pc set up to call her partner when she has a beautiful room in the basement, she took the lock off my door and replaced it with a shitty one because she wanted mine, she also took my shoes at one point without asking, i only have one pair so i couldnt go anywhere. she said if i wanted some to use hers, but the reason she was using mine was because she couldnt find hers. its just tinyy stuff like this that adds up over time, shes been doing this forever. my mom gets pissed when she uses her shoes and taking others shoes has become semi regular for her. same with my coat. she says its justified because ive borrowed her hoodies but to me a hoodie is a comfort item, shoes and a coat are essencial for going anywhere. she never asks too. she just takes them and acts like were being dramatic when were fed up. this isnt a one off senario by the way. this didnt all happen today. shes been like this since we were kids, i dont have many memories of her being nice to me.",2,1765500281.0,AITAH,10,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1pke1kb,https://i.redd.it/ylfaz0im6o6g1.jpeg,Squirreled Away (Ring Cycle),"The first thing he sensed was the weight. Next, its smell. Somewhere further down the list was how dark the room he was in looked. He felt sticky, no doubt his drying blood. The straw bedding of the nest was more comfortable than he was expecting, but Dale had always been a pessimist.

Not all Dales, mind you. Plenty were chipper fellows with a sense of wonder for the unknown. Our Dale was an exception to the rule. He preferred exceptionality to happiness. At his present and our subjective past, he certainly wasn’t happy.

Ratatoskr had broken his ribs and shattered his spine, but he had died worse. Healed from his injuries, Dale attempted to escape from under his large furry captor. Such efforts were in vain. Dale gave up his struggle and looked for the keystone of his quest. A golden ringlet could be seen halfway down the squirrel’s tail. 

With his only free hand, Dale reached for the ringlet but found it several arms lengths out of reach. It was at times like these that Dale wished to be able to cast spells like others in this foreign world. The cursed goat wouldn’t get stuck in a pitiful state like this. He’d know what to do.

Such thoughts helped Dale vent his frustrations surrounding his functional impotence in the face of obstacles. In less flowery words: Dale was useless. What use is a power that lets you survive death and be a bit stronger than an average person when you are put up to bat against literal gods?

Dale bemoaned his fate. And yet, he continued to think. No, not fire. He also can’t shoot his way out of this. Killing himself wouldn’t move anything along. Feeling around his surroundings, Dale felt a cold cylindrical object about the size of a candle. He pulled the object towards where his head was pinned down. The object looked familiar to Dale but mightily out of place in this fantasy world: a flare.

He hadn’t had it on him before his most recent curtain call. A gift from friends in low places. Mulling over a plan, Dale decided upon something reckless. The twins were dead and Sert was MIA. No one could help him so where’s the harm in a bad decision or two.

Psyching himself up with short, shallow breaths, Dale ignited the flare and held it up towards the monster’s tail. He then bellowed out a crackling shriek to startle the beast. Opening its yellow eyes, Ratatoskr turned towards the sound and was met with an exceedingly bright light. Flooding the rods of its eyes, the light temporarily suppressed Ratatoskr’s darkvision.

With its vision narrowed onto a single spot the squirrel lunged towards the light with jaws agape. The retaliatory attack severed Dale’s arm and robbed him of the flare, but it also caused Ratatoskr to bite through its own tail. Pain forced Ratatoskr to its feet as its eyes were slowly acclimating to the dark. Now free from under the weight of his captor, Dale lunged towards the ring resting limply on a bloody stump. Upon removing the ring, Dale felt a dark urge compel him to don the ring.

The ring shrunk in his palm so as to deprive him of a ready excuse. Too bad, he thought. He was missing an arm and couldn’t place it on himself. As if frustrated by his indecisiveness, the ring began to float and placed itself onto his middle finger.

“What the—?”

The darkness vanished as Dale could now see every corner of the space he was in. Ratatoskr, though flailing around, appeared to have beads of light connected by thin threads of energy webbing along the surface of its body. Looking down at the palm of his hand, he saw an almost mirrored image with the exception of two rings. His left hand had grown back and it was holding a glock. Instinct took over as he aimed the gun at a bead of light and time appeared to freeze. He squeezed the trigger and could see the bullet travel about a meter every ten seconds.

Aiming at all the largest beads of light, Dale unloaded the gun’s magazine and tossed it aside. Time began to speed up as the bullets cut into Ratatoskr and shattered the web of light. It shrieked in agony before limply dropping to the floor. Dale knew it was dead but wasn’t sure how he felt certain of it. Almost as if someone else was in his brain with him. Having achieved his goal, Dale remembered that 163 and Jammer were waiting on him.

Taking a step forward, Dale felt himself drop and land on his shoulder. His breathing grew ragged as the sharp pains splintered his brain. This was worse than dying. A hand reached out and grabbed his uninjured shoulder. Looking up, Dale saw a concerned dark elf picking him up and starting to sprint through the wooden halls of the World Tree. 

Consciousness ebbed and flowed. Jagged white and black lines. A shaggy-haired figure sat cross-legged in that monochrome space. He smiled. The man was a warm gun savoring its latest meal. Violence was its nature; its birthright. He didn’t need to kill, he wanted to. Dale was afraid at that moment that he was looking into a mirror. Touching his own mouth, Dale could feel his teeth and gums exposing themselves. He felt violated and free.

In what seemed to be the blink of an eye, Dale was sitting beyond the barrier with Sert, Jammer, and 163. The powers of the ring seemed to have faded despite him still wearing it. He’ll need to have Goatdigger look into it.

“Dale?” asked 163.

“Yeah?”

“Is it you this time? Really you?”

“What the hell are you on about? This better not be another prank. If you try saying I’ve become a goat again I’ll put laxatives in your coffee.”

“You’re back!”

163 hugs him. Dale can feel him shaking. The other two seem glad but more reserved in their expressions. Thinking of a way to get back on track, Dale holds up his right hand to show off the pilfered ring.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

The first date was just a cute coffee shop date and I thought he was cute, flirty, had a great personality being completely honest I was SMITTEN by this guy. so I get home and I text him saying I had a great time and I’d love to see him again and he feels the same way and he asks me out on a second date. Next Saturday we’re supposed to go to this christmas festival thing and he suggested that we can go over to his house after and he can make me something after (I told him before that I find guys that cook really attractive) so I was like okay that works for me. Friday rolls around and the dates on Saturday and I kinda get the understanding that going over to his house = things might escalate physically and I’m just not ready for that so I text him at 3 AM saying hey I take things slow physically and I don’t sleep with guys unless we’re in a relationship and he says that’s not a big deal as long as you feel things progressing toward a relationship and I was like sounds good. Some things end up happening on Saturday and I’m very late to the date and we have an argument and he leaves THIS WAS 100% MY FAULT AND COMPLETELY ON ME and I’m very apologetic and I tell him multiple times that I’m really sorry and we end up rescheduling the date for Monday (he apologized for bailing on me on Saturday and I’m like in love w this guy at this point). Then Monday rolls around we go on a date it’s sooo fun I like this guy and we end up making out in his car and at the end he says “I know you’re not comfortable with having sex unless we’re in a relationship but I was just wondering if you wanted to come over so we can hang out“ and it’s like 10 pm so I tell him no and we kinda set up a date for Friday at 7pm. We don’t really text each other in between dates and that’s totally find with me but he texts me on Thu saying “hey do you wanna come over to my house tomorrow and I could cook something for us or get take out and watch a movie“ (a bit of context needed here I told him on the first date I don’t like watching movies and he texted me later making a suggestive joke about ”we could watch and not pay attention to it“ and when I acted dumb about not understanding it he said it was a joke). Anyways I text him back saying hey I’m not comfortable with coming over and he repliiws no worries do you wanna grab sushi instead? and this is where I told him I don’t think our pace and comfort level were matching and he didnt do anything bad and it’s just that I don’t see anything long term so I’m gonna take a step back. guys I feel soo bad like he’s genuinely a great guy but I felt like he kept disrespectin my boundaries and idk how to feel about this whole situation

I didn’t drive straight to the station. I went back to the hotel.

My sister opened the door before I could knock. Her face was pale, eyes sunken from another sleepless night.

“Where were you?” she asked.

“I just needed to clear my head.”

She searched my face. “You look like hell.”

“I’ve had worse shifts.”

She tried to smile, but it broke halfway through. “I keep thinking maybe she’ll call” she said. “Like this is all some mistake.”

I forced myself to meet her eyes. “We’re going to find her. I promise.”

She nodded, but I could tell she didn’t believe me. “I keep replaying that morning” she whispered. “What I could’ve done different.”

“Don’t do that,” I said. “You’ll drive yourself crazy.”

“You’re one to talk.”

She was right.

I stayed until she finally laid down, exhaustion winning over fear once again. I watched her breathing even out before I slipped out again.

I parked two blocks away and sat in the car with the engine off. My phone sat in my lap like a live grenade. I wasn’t supposed to call anyone. I wasn’t supposed to do anything. But I couldn’t just wait for him to call.

If he said “the others,” then there had to be others.

I drove to the precinct, let myself in through the side entrance, and pulled every missing person report I could find that matched my niece’s age bracket. No one was watching, the desk officer was half asleep.

I sat in the dark with the blue glow of the screen washing over me.

Names, faces, addresses. Most were runaways, custody disputes, tragic but explainable.

But a few… felt wrong. Clean houses. Quiet neighborhoods. Parents who described the same eerie calm.

“Nothing seemed out of place.”
“It looked like she’d just gone to school.”
“The bed was made.”

The phrase kept repeating across different reports like background noise I hadn’t noticed before. Not enough to build a case. Just enough to itch under the skin.

One detective had even written, no signs of struggle, room unusually tidy.

Unusually tidy.

I leaned back in the chair. If I said anything, if I pointed this out, it would sound like pattern chasing. Like paranoia. But I knew what I was looking at.

He wasn’t picking victims. He was picking environments.

Perfect homes. Perfect kids.

He’d been doing this for a while, quietly, carefully. Long enough that the evidence looked like coincidence.

I copied what I could onto a flash drive and pocketed it. When I left the building, the night air hit cold and sharp. The streets were empty.

For a second I thought about going back to the hotel, but the thought of seeing my sister’s face again, of having to lie, it made my stomach twist.

So I sat in the car instead, the reports flickering in my head.

The dashboard clock read 2:43 a.m. when the phone buzzed. Blocked number.

I didn’t answer at first. I just watched it light up, once, twice, three times. On the fourth, I picked up.

“You’re working late” Mark said.

My stomach went cold. “How do you know that?”

“You drive like someone looking for a reason not to go home.”
He paused, almost amused. “Did you find them? The others?”

I said nothing.

“I figured you might” he continued. “You’re a good officer. A practiced one. That’s what I like about you. You believe repetition makes things safe. You do something enough times, you start to think it’ll protect you.”

My throat felt tight. “What do you want?”

“To teach” he said simply. “Perfection begins with practice.”

The line stayed quiet for a beat. I could hear faint movement on his end, something brushing against fabric, then the soft click of a switch.

“You practice every day” he said. “Routine. Coffee. Uniform. You think that makes you strong. But repetition is just another way of hiding fear. So tonight, we will practice something new.”

“I’m not playing your game.”

“You already are” he said. “You’ve been playing since the day you met me. Tonight, go home. Don’t look for me. Don’t call anyone. Just keep practicing what you do best, pretending everything’s fine.”

The call ended.

I sat there, staring at my reflection in the windshield. My pulse was still hammering in my ears.

Practice. The word crawled under my skin.

The phone buzzed again at 4:17 a.m. Blocked number.

I almost didn’t answer. Part of me hoped if I ignored it, it would stop. But it didn’t.

I picked up. “Where is she?”

Mark’s voice came through soft, steady. “You sound tired.”

“Tell me where she is.”

“You’ve been asking all the wrong questions” he said. “That’s what happens when people don’t understand the lesson.”

I rubbed a hand over my face, trying to steady my breathing. “What lesson?”

He let the silence hang long enough for me to hear how calm he was.
“Perfection takes practice” he said finally. “And what better place to practice than where she learned what perfect looked like?”

The words just hung there between us.

For a few seconds, I didn’t move. I didn’t even understand.
She never cared about perfect, her room was always a wreck.
That was half the joke between us. I used to step over piles of clothes and tell her it looked like her closet exploded. She’d laugh and say it was creative.

But that night, when she went missing, her room had been spotless.
Too spotless.

My chest tightened.

He wasn’t talking about memory. He was talking about now.

I swallowed hard. “Mark…”

“She’s improving” he said softly. “You should be proud. I think she finally understands what I’m trying to show her.”

The line clicked.

For a long time I just sat there, the phone still in my hand. The air inside the car felt heavier, like the oxygen had thinned.
I wanted to believe he was bluffing. That maybe he meant something else.
But the words kept replaying. Where she learned what perfect looked like.

Her room.

That perfect room.

He was there.

By the time I started the car, my hands were shaking so bad I nearly dropped the keys.
I didn’t bother turning on the siren. I just drove.

I was halfway to the house when the phone lit up. My sister.

“Hey…”

She cut me off before I could say anything. Her voice was frantic, high, trembling.
“I just talked to her!”

I gripped the wheel tighter. “What?”

“I talked to her. She called me. I swear to God she called me.”

My pulse slammed in my ears. “Slow down. Tell me what happened.”

“She was whispering,” she said, her words tripping over each other. “I could barely hear her. I kept saying her name, and then… then I heard him.”

My stomach turned. “You’re sure?”

“It was him. The man who took her.” She was crying now, breath catching between every word. “He told her to say something. Like it was a game.”

I swallowed hard. “What did she say?”

There was silence on the line except for her breathing. Then she whispered,
“She said, ‘Mommy, he wants me to tell you… perfection takes pain.’”

I slammed the brakes, the car jerking sideways on the empty road.

“What?”

“That’s what she said. And then she screamed. And then” her voice broke. “And the call just… just ended.”

I pressed the phone tight to my ear, but there was nothing left. No sound.

“Stay in the room,” I said. My voice came out lower, steadier than I felt. “Lock the door and don’t move. Do you understand me?”

She tried to speak, but I hung up before she could argue.

The road stretched out in front of me, black and endless.
My hands wouldn’t stop shaking, but I pressed down on the gas anyway.

Tires screeched as I pulled into the driveway.
I barely threw the car into park before I was out, gun in hand.

The front door was unlocked. I pushed it open and moved room to room—slow, methodical, every corner cleared, every shadow checked.

The house was silent.
Too silent.

The only light came from the crack beneath my niece’s bedroom door. A faint, steady glow that painted a thin line across the hallway floor.

I raised my weapon and turned the handle slowly.

She was there.
Curled up on the floor beside her bed, shaking but unharmed. Her eyes found mine and she started to sob.

I holstered my gun and dropped to my knees. “Hey, hey—it’s okay. You’re safe now. I’ve got you.”

She couldn’t get the words out—just nods, gasps, and the sound of her breathing against my chest.

Then a noise broke the quiet.
A soft whir, mechanical, familiar.

The printer.

It sat on the desk across the room, light blinking. A fresh sheet slid out, face-down.

I stood up and walked over, my pulse hammering in my ears.

When I flipped the page over, my stomach turned to ice.

It was a photo of the hotel. My sister’s hotel room door.
Across it, in thick red letters:
PERFECTION TAKES PAIN.


I called the precinct on the way.
My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold the phone steady.

“Yeah, it’s me,” I said. “I found my niece. She’s alive. I need units at the hotel we were staying at right now.”

They started asking questions I didn’t have answers for.
“He’s there” I said. “He went after my sister. Just get there. Please.”

My niece sat in the passenger seat beside me, small and silent.
Her hands clutched her stuffed rabbit like it was part of her. She hadn’t spoken since I found her.

The drive felt endless. Every red light looked the same color as the ink on that note.
Perfection takes pain.
Over and over until the words stopped sounding human.

When I turned into the parking lot, I saw the light from our room still on. 

I parked hard and got out, my niece right behind me.
The door was cracked open.

The smell hit before I even stepped inside.
Metal. Copper. Something heavy in the air.

I told my niece to stay close. She gripped the back of my jacket.

The room was quiet.
Too quiet.

The bed was made.
The lamp was still on.
Everything was perfect.

I cleared the corners, the bathroom, the closet.
Nothing.

Then I saw it.

On the wall above the bed. Long, careful strokes of red.
Not splattered. Not rushed.
Written with precision.

Perfection takes pain.

My chest locked up.
I said her name once.
No answer.

My niece started crying behind me, soft and uneven.
I didn’t turn around.
I couldn’t.

There wasn’t blood everywhere.
Just enough to write.
Just enough to know she hadn’t left on her own.

I stood there for a long time, staring at that word.
The edges of each letter glistened in the light.

And that’s when I realized he wasn’t teaching her.
He was teaching me.

I've been using it for about 4 years now, mostly sticking to Maeng Da and Green Borneo, but I decided to mix things up.

I tried White Bali for the first time last week, and wow, the energy boost was pretty intense. I took about 5g and felt super focused for a good 3-4 hours. It was like coffee but without the jitters, which was nice. However, I did notice a bit of anxiety creeping in towards the end of the burn, so I’m thinking maybe it’s more of a morning strain for me.

On the flip side, I went back to my trusty Green Borneo after that, and it was like a warm hug. I usually take around 4g, and it just settles me in the evening. The mood lift is real, and I feel more social without feeling too wired. 

I also tried a little strain rotation recently, throwing in some Red Thai. I can see why people love it; it’s got that relaxing vibe. I didn’t want to overdo it, so I kept it around 3g, which was just right for winding down. 

Not sure if anyone else feels this, but sometimes it feels like less is more, especially with stronger strains. Anyway, I’m still figuring out the balance, but it’s been a fun ride. 

What strains are you all into lately? Any recommendations for evening use?",1,1765499761.0,KratomVibes,0,1.0,False

I’m a 30 year old male hoping to meet some new friends/friend groups to hangout and get close with. Since high school I’ve drifted apart from alot of friends. I only have one really good friend from high school who works and is away alot so I have been really lonely and even growing depressed lately. Even going through a break up so that’s not helping. I live on Whyte ave and would love to go out on Whyte and check out some pubs/bars/restaurants and even open to clubs but I have no one to do that kind of stuff with. Here is a bit about me:

- I’m a 30 year old man
- I enjoy living a healthy lifestyle as I do go to the gym, meal prep and track my calories.
- I just got into motorbiking in the summer. Was my first season and definitely planning to continue 
- I also love travel and would be thrilled to meet like minded people who would be open to eventually going on trips together 
- I also love small road trips such as mountain trips to go hiking and what not. 
- I also produce music and love EDM so I do enjoy going to raves and concerts.

Feel free to DM me and we can chat and maybe meet up for a drink or coffee or something.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Please help x,"My best friend doesn’t like my boyfriend from past stories she’s heard about him. My boyfriend says the stories aren’t true and that heads and tails have been created to make the stories seem worse than what they are. I reassured my boyfriend that I don’t care about the stories and it will not affect our relationship.

We have had fights and I vented to my friend about them. When me and boyfriend broke up, I booked Manchester with that friend for New Years and we ended up getting back together again. My friend and her partner have been through a lot also and I’ve always been there for her when she needed me, when she got back with him every time I never once judged her or got angry. 

I was meant to go out with her and another friend on a night out and when she found out I got back with him, she never followed up on the plan to go on that night out. She started posting stories of her and that friend on the night out, leaving me feel excluded and hurt. 

The next day she text me saying she heard another bad story about my boyfriend. He proved to me with evidence it wasn’t true. 

Her and her boyfriend got into another fight and she asked me to stay over to keep her company and I did without hesitation. I haven’t heard from her in a month and she text me randomly saying “hey are we still going to Manchester because I haven’t heard from you in weeks and I just want that sorted. The next payment is due Friday”. 

I replied to her msg saying I’d send it to her by then. She asked me meet me the Sunday for a coffee, the Sunday came around and no word. 3/4 days later she text me saying “hey that payment is due Friday. I asked her can we meet for a coffee and she said maybe Sunday if I want , that she is having a stressful week. 

What should I do ? I no longer want to go on the holiday as I feel she is just using me at this stage and my boyfriend also feels hurt about the situation. ",1,1765499673.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Been brewing coffee at home for the last four or five years happily but recently I've fallen out of love with the process.  
After a fair amount of thinking I'm down to either not enjoying the process/routine with my Rancilio Silvia or single dose grinding with my Varia VS3.  
I enjoy the coffee I brew but the constant fiddling with the silvia and the single dose workflow seems to be a barrier as honestly I cannot be bothered.

So I was thinking of the following options.

\- Selling my Silvia & buying a cheap bambino.

\- Sell the VS3 & get a eureka mignon/or similar grinder with a small hopper.

\- Sell them both & see what options pop up?

Any suggestions would be appreciated, a simplification is likely where im heading but what exactly I'm not 100% sure.

His wife and I moved in together, and now he’s the one sleeping in his car","[[[didn’t know this would turn into such a long post when I started writing. just dumped everything that’s been going on in my head here. I know it might sound like some wild creative story, but trust me, this really happened to me 😭]]]

I’m 25, and for the last 2.5 years, I thought I was in a great relationship with “Adam,” who’s 31. It was the kinda relationship where you daydream about the future and like, write his last name after yours when you’re bored at work...

Now? Now, I’m living with his wife. Yeah, you read that right

We met on Hinge. His profile said “divorced, no kids” and “looking for something serious.” Our first date was, like, classic but cute. We went to a small bar with a pool table. He taught me how to shoot, even though I was already good at it. He put his hand on my waist. He walked me home, didn’t push for sex, and texted me to check if I got home safely, sending me pics of his cat. It was picture perfect.He was consistent. Sent good morning texts, made goodnight calls. He remembered my coffee order, came to my graduation, and cried when I got my first real job. My friends were, like, “This guy is a green flag.” I was that annoying girl in the group chat saying, “OMG, he’s actually emotionally available!!!”

But... I overlooked two “yellow flags”:

1. I’d never been to his place. He always gave some excuse: “It’s too far, it’s messy, my roommate’s got someone over”. We mostly stayed at my place or traveled together

2. He was weird about photos. We took pics together, but he never wanted to post any. He was be like, “my ex is crazy, I don’t want any drama”

I was just in love, okay? Just... so blissfully naïve

Then boom, reality hit me like a truck.

A new woman started at my job. We went for drinks after work, added each other on Insta, and while I was half asleep that night, I scrolled through her page. I stopped when I saw a wedding photo..😶‍🌫️

The groom looked JUST like my boyfriend🫢
At first, I laughed, then I zoomed in, and no way. Same jawline, same dimple. My mind went noooo. But then I swiped through the rest of the photos...
Same tattoo on his wrist Same watch I got him for his birthday. SAME EXACT MAN 🤯

The profile read: “my forever” “three years with my best friend"" “couldn’t have picked a better father for my kids” Kids. Plural
In a pic he was holding a newborn in a tiny pink hat. I checked the date, it overlapped with a weekend he said he was on a someone's trip. I felt like ice cold. The tunnel vision, when everything goes silent. That was me.

I clicked on her profile. The nickname is Jemima, 29. Her bio says: Wife ,mom of two, true crime & iced coffee. Her page was basically a scrapbook of their entire relationship/engagement/wedding/pregnancies/first steps/dinners. While I was getting supermarket flowers from him on a random day, they were having family photoshoots in matching outfits...Then, after that, I scrolled back to the day he first messaged me on Hinge. He started dating me before their second baby was even born. I was like WTF! 😳

I don’t even remember how long I sat on my bathroom floor just staring at my phone. I blocked him, then unblocked him, typed “how could you” and deleted it. I called my best friend but hung up before it rang. I felt sick. I cried. Then...?? something snapped inside me

If I was blindsided, she had to be too🤐

I stalked her page for 24 hours straight. No suspicious photos, no shady captions. Everything seemed like this boring, domestic happiness. He was living a double life like a freakin' pro. So I made a Google voice account and messaged her saying: jey, this sounds crazy but I promise I’m not trolling you. I think we... might be dating the same men”.I sent her a few photos: a selfie of us at my graduation where he’s kissing my cheek, and, a screenshot of our Hinge chat where he says, “I’ve been divorced for a year, my ex is crazy”

Shockingly, she replied within a minute: Call me. Right now. I couldn’t stop shaking, but I hit that green button She picked up on the first ring, no ""hello"", and said: How long? I said to her: just 2.5 years. Then? An awful silence and she broke down sobbing/gasping. She said they were married for 4 years, together for 7, with 2 kids under 3. She used to think, he was just working late, going to gym more, having extra shifts.

All those “late-night gym selfies?” they were just him in parking lot of Planet Fitness near their house. We spent 3 hours on the phone comparing dates/ restaurants/timelines. Then realized he literally copied everything. He took us to the same places, bought us the same cheap jewelery, and using same lines. She told me that she felt like her whole life was just a rental she had never signed up for.🥲 By the end of the call we weren’t crying anymore. We were both just… quiet. Numb. Angry in this very calm way. Then she asked, “Do you wanna blow up his life with me?”

I said yes

So we made a plan👁️

She invited him to a family dinner at her parents' house for her dad’s birthday. She told him to dress nice and not to be late. She texted me the address and time. I arrived 15 minutes early with a bottle of wine and printed screenshots of EVERYTHING. Her parents already knew what was going on. Her mom hugged me like I was family. Her dad looked like he wanted to commit murder.
When he pulled up, I was watching from the window. My heart was racing as if I were cheating-even though I was the one who was being cheated on. The liar just walked in, all charming, kissed his wife, greeted her parents.He did not notice me at first because I was sitting in the corner of the living room. Then Jemima said to him: “Adam, she is Jacqueline. You’ve been dating her for two and a half years”

He turned. Our eyes locked. I swear I saw his soul leave his body. He went pale. Then red. Then that weird color people get when they feel faint. He tried to laugh it off at first. “Babe, what is this? Some kind of joke?” He looked at me like I was supposed to play along. I just placed the stack of papers on the coffee table. Screenshots/photos,bank statements,hiis Hinge profile

Her dad looked at him asking him to settle down first to which he denied. Then he threw some story about how we “were on a break” when he met me. “Just friends,” he said calling me a stalker in front of her family.

That’s when I snapped

I pulled out my phone and played a voice note where he told me, just two days ago, that he couldn’t wait to finally move in together and feeling stuck in a dead marriage with a roommate. Jemima just stared at him, not shouting, just... disappointed. It was like watching a stranger wearing her husband’s face. Her dad said, “Go get your things. My daughter will pack what she wants. You have ten minutes to leave my house”. He tried to plead, cry, and grab jemina. Her mom stepped between them.

I grabbed my keys and left because I was shaking so badly and I didn’t want to hear him say my name again. I thought that was the end of it. I went home. Blocked him on everything. Sat on my bed and stared at the wall and wondered how I was going to explain to my friends that my “green-flag-guy” was just a liar.

Then Jemima texted me: “I kicked him out. I’m filing tomorrow. I don’t want to be alone with two kids and a mortgage. Do you... want a roommate?”

She was dead serious

I said yes

So now I live in the spare room of the house he was paying for. I give her money for rent and groceries, help with the kids, and we’ve built this weird little alliance out of the ruins of his double life. People keep asking if I’m okay and I don’t know how to answer. Some days I feel like a homewrecker. Some days I feel like I accidentally rescued a stranger from a burning building I helped light.

Here’s the part I haven’t told anyone in my real life: I’m starting to have feelings for Jemima. Not in a “haha let’s trauma bond and joke about being wives” way ,but, in a very real/inconvenient way. We stay up late talking about everything. She falls asleep on the couch with her head on my shoulder. She texts me memes all day, steals my hoodies, makes my coffee exactly how I like it without asking. The first time I saw her in scrub pants and a messy bun, wrangling a toddler on her hip, I had this intrusive thought of “I’d marry you and never lie to you I don’t even know what my label is. I never questioned my sexuality before. I dated men. I loved him. Now I look at his wife and think, “You were the upgrade all along.” I’m not doing anything about it. She’s freshly separated, grieving the life she thought she had. I’m the other woman who wasn’t supposed to exist. The last thing she needs is me complicating it further.

So I’m just here. Living in the house my ex lied his way into, helping his wife rebuild a life that never should’ve been broken, learning how to make dinosaur-shaped pancakes for kids who call me “jacqueline” and think I’m just there mom’s friend. Sometimes we are just sitting on the couch, kids finally asleep, Netflix humming in the background, and she looks over and says, “Thank you for telling me. I’m glad it was you.”

I needed to put this somewhere because it feels too insane to be real and too heavy to keep in my head. No one in my real life knows the full story. To my friends, I just “found out he was cheating.” To her family, I’m “the girlfriend.” Only she and I know every ugly detail.

(my deepest gratitude if you have really honestly read this far!!! Hugs!!! (⁠个⁠_⁠个⁠))

TL;DR: Dated a guy for 2.5 years. Found out through Instagram that he’s married with two kids. His wife and I compared timelines and confronted him at a “family dinner.” We kicked him out and moved in together as roommates.

Just in time to celebrate our first Christmas together. The boxes weren’t all unpacked, and the heat ran a little too long before kicking in, but we were determined to make it feel like home. I hung warm lights inside every window, set up our first tree, and lit a cinnamon candle on the coffee table.

The tree had already started dropping pine needles, but that’s what comes with a real tree I told myself. And considering the price, we got very lucky. Not the most normal purchase I have made, from an elderly man outside his falling apart farm house. It seemed to be the only one he was selling. But considering it was a week from Christmas, I happily took it off his hands.

“Cozy,” Rowan said.

“Almost,” I replied, rubbing my arms. “It’s colder tonight.”

Rowan nodded, glancing toward the hallway. “Yeah. Feels like a draft.”

I didn’t mention that I’d thought she saw something move there, just a small shape, low to the ground, like someone crouched too close to the floor. A trick of the lights, I told myself.

We spent the evening watching Christmas movies, but neither of us could fully relax. I kept feeling watched from the kitchen doorway. I didn’t see anything, never long enough to be sure, but every time I turned my head, I caught the tail end of motion, just slipping out of sight.

We went to bed early. The house felt too busy, even with just the two of us, it felt like someone, or something was always just out of sight. Just after midnight, I woke to the quietest, most deliberate creak. I lifted my head. Rowan was asleep beside me.

Another creak.

Closer this time.

Right outside their door.

My breath caught. I could feel something on the other side, crouched, waiting. I didn’t dare wake Rowan any movement felt like an invitation. Eventually the pressure faded and the sense of being watched slipped away. I eventually fell asleep to the sound of the wind, telling myself it had only been the house settling.

Morning came, I tried to shake it off.

We planned to wrap presents and we laughed about “new house paranoia.”

But on the floor outside the bedroom door, Rowan noticed something on the floor right outside the bedroom door, pine needles. A whole cluster of them.

We went downstairs and I immediately noticed it, the tree, which yesterday was tucked neatly into the corner, was now almost a foot or two away from the wall, leaving a big gap behind it. Well, we were very tired last night, it couldn’t have been anything else but simple misremembering. I hoped. I didn’t mention it.

We stayed up late, trying to act normal. We played music, made popcorn, talked about which ornaments to buy next year. But the house felt different, too still, too expectant.

Sometime around midnight, the lights flickered. Not the whole house just the strings in the living room and hallway. They dimmed and brightened in a slow pulse, like the house was breathing.

Rowan’s voice was tight. “Did you see that?”

I nodded. “Maybe old wiring.” Desperate to prove that our new house that we worked so hard for, didn’t turn out to be haunted

“Maybe,” Rowan said. But he was staring at the dark corner behind the tree, just to the right of where I was sat, just out of m peripheral “Jamie… do you feel like something is in here with us?”

I did. I had all evening, a prickling sense that someone was just behind my chair, leaning in close, so close they could see the pattern of my Pjs. Every time I turned, nothing was there. But the feeling snapped back the moment i looked away.

Around one in the morning, Rowan went to brush his teeth, but he didn’t come back.

I waited.

Five minutes.

Ten.

Finally, I got up.

“Rowan?” I called softly.

Movement answered.

Not Rowan’s voice just a quick shuffle, like feet … or hands scurrying across the tiles.

I stepped into the hallway. The lights were low, dimmed as though something pressed its weight against the wiring. The bathroom door was open. Inside, Rowan stood frozen at the sink, toothbrush in hand, eyes locked on the mirror. I followed his gaze.

There was nothing in the reflection behind Rowan… but the ceiling above the doorway looked wrong, just a shade darker than it should be, like something was pressed flat against it, clinging there, head angled down watching Rowan from above, trying to be out of sight, almost afraid of being seen.

I blinked. The dark patch dissolved, retreating fast into the corner where the light didn’t quite reach. Rowan whispered, “We need to leave.”

We packed nothing. Just grabbed coats and headed for the front door, but as we reached the living room, we stopped dead. The tree was no longer upright It was bent, almost bowed, its top angled down as if something heavy had been perched on it, pine needles, far too many to make sense, were scattered across the floor in a trail leading to the hallway.

I swallowed hard. “Go. Now.”

We moved fast. Rowan reached for the door but it opened before they touched it. We ran out the house, and didn’t stop running until we reached the car. Breathing rapid and shallow he reversed out, swerving and setting off down the road.

Rowan tore down the icy road, hands shaking, headlights slicing through the dark. I pressed a hand to her chest, trying to breathe.

“We’re almost out,” Rowan whispered. “We’re almost—”

A sudden chill swept through the car. Not from outside but from the back seat. I felt a gentle brush of cold air, like something had leaned close. Rowan noticed this and dared to look in the rear view mirror.

“Jamie, do not turn around”

My breath caught in my throat and I knew what It was before I saw it, it was the creature. it had followed them, I saw it clearly now, almost under a spotlight with each passing streetlight. It was curled up on their back seat, its head slowly looked up to make eye contact and I screamed. Rowan swerved in a panic, and the car skidded into a soft snowbank at the edge of the woods. The impact was mild, just enough to shake loose a dusting of snow from the branches overhead.

Me and Rowan were slightly dazed, but shared a quick glance with each other before turning our heads to see into the backseat. The creature wasn’t curled up now. It sat upright, its long, wooden limbs folded neatly. Pine needles drifted from its twig-like hair. Its dark eyes weren’t hungry… just ancient. Watching.

I gasped, but the creature didn’t move. We both winced and prepared for an attack of some sort, our hearts ripped out or even our heads removed. We just hoped it would be quick. With almost a minute past and we still had our heads, a small noise made us open our eyes. The creature lifted one hand and pointed out the window. I cautiously followed the gesture.

An old, half-rotted sign stood crooked in the snow

**GUARDIANS OF THE ROOTED HILL**

**HONOR THE WOOD**

**RESPECT THE TREE TAKEN**

Rowan whispered, “Guardians…?”

I froze, and then it hit me.

“The Christmas tree,” I murmured. “The one from the old farm estate…this is where we got it from, the old man said it was ‘from special land.’ We thought they meant organic.”

Rowan swallowed. “You think… it was cut from here?”

The creature blinked once, slowly, like a nod.

Then it pressed one twig-finger gently to its own chest and motioned to the land they had gotten the tree from. I felt my stomach twist. “It was part of them.” Not the creature itself, but its forest. Its family. Its home.

The creature blinked softly, and my eyes softened. Rowan’s grip on the wheel loosened, we had been running from something we never tried to understand. It never even tried to hurt us, or even scare us. In fact, it tried to do the opposite, tried to stay out of sight, it was us always looking for it in the corner of our eyes.

I turned fully toward the creature. “You followed us because the tree is a part of you?”

The creature nodded. Rowan’s voice cracked. “And now we are your guardians.” He said as a statement more than a question, the creature seemed to become less terrifying by the second. A warmth spread through the car not heat, but relief. The oppressive fear lifted, replaced with something calmer, older, rooted, I reached out a trembling hand.

The creature leaned forward and, very gently, touched my fingers with its wooden ones. Its touch was cold, but not frightening. A thank you. Or a greeting.

Rowan exhaled. “We took it without meaning harm. We didn’t know.”

The creature tilted its head, as if listening, and then pointed back down the snowy road toward their home. I smiled sympathetically. The creature’s eyes glowed faintly, like embers warming in the dark, and its face began to look more human. I saw movement in the back window and tried to focus my eyes. Figures emerged from the trees, dozens of them. Not menacing, just watching, curious, hopeful. Their shapes were gentle, like a stray kitten approaching a human for the first time. I looked at my husband and we smiled,

Rowan placed a hand on my knee.

“Let’s go home,” he whispered.

The creatures parted, forming a quiet path back toward the house. Guiding us, not forcing us, and we felt like we were part of something bigger, more important. As Guardians. I wondered how many of them were out there.

Me and Rowan stepped out into the snow, hands intertwined, the creature padding beside us like a silent guardian of its own. And for the first time, the night didn’t feel cold, all three of us, finally felt safe.",4,1765499562.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Someone dies and by morning the coffee machines are already warming up like nothing happened.

Maybe that’s the truth cities don’t talk about. Not every place needs to crush you to erase you. Some places just let you fade quietly. Brisbane doesn’t take your soul it simply never asks for it.

Somewhere around week twelve, right after we thought we’ve got this, our tiny predictable world cracked open. Two feeds a night, down easy in the bassinet then overnight, chaos. Naps? A myth. Daytime turned to dread, the hours stretched between cries and rocking.

By week thirteen, bedtime joined the rebellion. An hour long protest, sweet face streaked with tears ours too sometimes. “Six weeks of hell,” I whispered into the dark, like a prayer I didn’t mean to say aloud.

Week fifteen came shouting wake ups now whenever he pleased. Night and day blurred, each feeding running into another. Still six weeks of hell.

Week sixteen brought a twist rolling, tumbling, growing, “progression,” they call it. But all I saw were thirty minute naps and a baby who needed me every time the world tilted wrong. Still six weeks of hell.

Seventeen weeks crib refusal season. Lay him down, eyes spring open. Nap trapped, four times a day, with aching arms and a heart too full to complain.

Split nights, teething, rolling, stuck again, every book devoured, every post read, every room darkened, every sound machine humming. We’ve done it all. Still six weeks of hell.

Last night, maybe the worst every hour, wide eyes and cries. Pick up, rock, repeat. Little body fighting sleep, jerking, stirring, restless in dreams I’d trade anything to calm.

Now twenty weeks, almost twenty one. He smiles at the sun, bubbles giggles even when his eyes are red with tired. And me? I’m half soul, half sleep deprived ghost, wholly in love with this tiny human who’s rewriting every rhythm I ever knew.

Hi guys, my friends and I have written a rather ambitious story and would like to get feedback. We have consulted people we know and we have gotten some positive feedback and we would appreciate your honest inputs too. Please do give a read and let us know what you think! It is a long read but we believe it is worth a read!

P.s. It was formatted using AI to make it neat and coherent but the content is 100% ours :)

In a Traffic control center in Berlin, Harsha (32), a pragmatic defense contractor and geopolitical architect, activates “Project: VEDHA”—a Quantum Decryption Engine capable of cracking any firewall on Earth in nanoseconds. To demonstrate its power to a shady board of investors, Harsha manufactures a silent yet calculated “accident.” He orchestrates a fatal crash for a local corrupt businessman by remotely overriding a self-driving car and manipulating traffic lights, arguing that “Chaos is the enemy; Control is the cure.” His rationale is pragmatic and cold: “Human Error” is the root of all war, and VEDHA will serve as a “Global Governor”—an impartial, emotionless machine that forces peace by controlling the levers of power. The system is capable of small scale operations such as the accident he just caused but it requires a biological “Dead Man’s Switch” to fully activate and perform larger scale operations such as controlling whole nations—a safety measure locked to the biometric neural patterns of its original architect, Indian RAW Agent Kabir (35).

Kabir is a suave, hyper-lethal operative for the Indian Intelligence Bureau’s “Shadow Wing.” In a sleek infiltration sequence in Lisbon, Kabir retrieves the biometric key (stored in a liquid-neural drive) from his laboratory but is spotted by Harsha’s mercenaries. After the ensuing chase, he is cornered in an unmanned area in the Port of Lisbon by Harsha’s “Erasure Squad.” Moments before being incinerated by a flamethrower (to prevent any DNA traces), he injects his consciousness and the encrypted key into a prototype bone-conduction drive and throws it onto a cargo container bound for India.

The scene then cuts sharply from the sterile cold of Europe to the sensory explosion of the Kasimedu Fishing Harbor at sunrise. The screen fills with the chaos of the morning auction—the deafening roar of diesel trawlers, the slap of wet fish on concrete, and the neon-orange tangle of nets. We meet Shiva (30), not on land, but mid-air, leaping between rocking boats in a high-octane foot chase. He is pursuing a rival gang member who stole the day’s catch from an elderly widow. Shiva moves with the reckless grace of a man born on the waves, using anchor chains as swing-lines and sliding under swinging crates of ice. He corners the thief on a slippery pier, subduing him not with a punch, but by expertly casting a heavy weighted net to entrap him, earning a roar of approval from the local fishermen.

The victory is short-lived. As Shiva hands the recovered money back to the widow, a sleek, black SUV cuts through the crowd, silencing the cheers. Enter Raja, the sector’s ruthless loan shark. The interaction reveals Shiva’s desperate reality: he isn’t a hero; he is a tenant in his own life. Shiva hands over his entire share of the morning’s earnings just to cover the interest on a massive loan taken by his late father. Raja sneers, pointing toward the shoreline where Shiva’s ancestral home stands—a crumbling but majestic Chettinad-style house that looks out of place amidst the tin sheds. “The soil is worth more than the bricks, Shiva,” Raja warns. “Miss next week’s payment, and I turn your grandfather’s legacy into a parking lot.”

Shiva walks home, the weight of the threat crushing his shoulders, but stops to wash his face and put on a smile before entering the courtyard. Here, the noise of the harbor fades. We see Seetha (23), his younger sister, painting the peeling walls of the house. She asks if he paid the “bad man.” Shiva lies with exaggerated confidence that the debt is almost cleared and that he’s saving for her art school fees. As he watches her innocently return to her painting, the camera lingers on Shiva’s eyes—the desperation is palpable. He isn’t fighting for a building; he is fighting for the only sanctuary his sister has left in a brutal world.

One day, Shiva discovers the device on the boat of one of his friends, who happens to be a pirate. When asked about the device, the pirate tells him that he looted it off a European Cargo Ship but has no idea what the device is. Shiva thinks it’s a high-end hearing aid or Bluetooth earpiece worth a lot of money. He takes it back home and puts it on. The device’s needles micro-inject into his skull.

The device is activated, initiating the “Neural Residency.” This isn’t just a voice in his head; it’s a “Tactical Overlay” hallucination where Kabir appears as a hologram. When Kabir’s tuxedo-clad avatar appears in Shiva’s vision, Shiva doesn’t think “Sci-Fi”; he thinks “Muni/Kanchana.” Convinced he is haunted by a “foreign ghost,” Shiva drags himself to a local, fraudulent exorcist. While the exorcist beats Shiva with neem branches to “drive out the spirit,” Kabir (visible only to Shiva) stands in the corner, calmly analyzing the exorcist’s fake props and diagnosing the man with a calcium deficiency based on his posture. The humor escalates as Kabir’s “Tactical Overlay” begins critiquing Shiva’s lifestyle. When Shiva goes to eat roadside pani puri, the HUD flashes massive red warnings: BIOHAZARD DETECTED: CHOLERA IMMINENT. Shiva ignores it, leading to a bickering match with “the air” in the middle of the street, making bystanders think he has lost his mind. The “Odd Couple” dynamic is cemented in the bathroom, where Shiva demands privacy, and Kabir, unable to “turn off” his visual feed, politely turns his virtual back but critiques the lack of hygiene in the restroom, driving Shiva to a breaking point of frustration.

Shiva tries to block out Kabir by talking loudly to himself and pacing relentlessly, refusing to focus on the hologram or the voice in his head. Kabir attempts to warn him of the gravity of the situation and the imminent danger, but his efforts are in vain. Desperate and frustrated, Shiva begins banging his head against the wall until he bleeds and collapses. Fearing further harm, Kabir reluctantly withdraws, ceasing his attempts to reach him.

In London, Harsha’s AI (VEDHA) detects the login attempt. It cannot pinpoint the exact street immediately because the signal is bouncing off Chennai’s chaotic, dense infrastructure. However, VEDHA triangulates the signal to North Chennai, Grid Sector 4 (The Harbor). Harsha immediately deploys The Silencer, a deadly mercenary clad as the Plague Doctor, who is already stationed in the region as a contingency.

The Silencer arrives in North Chennai with a Haptic Frequency Scanner (a handheld device looking like a tactical phone). The chip in Shiva’s head isn’t just transmitting GPS; it is syncing with his biology. The chip emits a digital pulse every time Shiva’s heart beats.

The Silencer moves through the streets with his henchmen. When he gets closer to Shiva, the scanner vibrates more intensely. He is literally tracking Shiva’s heartbeat amidst the electronic noise of the city.

Simultaneously, relieved that Kabir has finally vanished from his vision, Shiva heads to his local tea shop, smiling as he meets his friends and enjoys a warm cup of tea. Just then, The Silencer manages to track Shiva down to the tea shop and slashes him with a Katana but Shiva narrowly misses the hit. A confused and petrified Shiva tries to evade him and run, but Kabir realizes running is illogical. When Shiva’s heart rate hits 180 BPM (panic), the chip’s “Survival Protocol” engages. Kabir overrides Shiva’s motor cortex. The audience sees the HUD interface: ADRENALINE: 180 BPM > MOTOR CONTROL: KABIR.

The camera snaps into “First Person View” (HUD style). We see target markers on the enemies. Shiva’s body executes a sequence of lethal Krav Maga moves that Shiva doesn’t know. Shiva is screaming apologies to the goons—“Sorry, brother! I don’t know why I’m hitting you!”— while he snaps a neck, disarms a gunman, and shoots three people with terrifying accuracy. Realizing that Shiva is more dangerous than he appears, The Silencer silently retreats from the scene. After the fight, his adrenaline drops and Shiva regains control. He looks at his shaking hands, terrified. He doesn’t know how to shoot a gun, yet he just headshot three men. Kabir appears in a mirror reflection and says, “We need to talk.”

Shiva heads back home and as he rushes through the front door, his hand instinctively raises to touch the garlanded photo of his father, but his hand stops mid-air, hovers for a split second before he touches the picture and prays to his father.

Kabir lays out the full reality, revealing the details of his mission and why Harsha is after him. In the flashback, we learn that Harsha was once his assistant while working on the chip—a mild-mannered, principled man. But when a corrupt superior tried to sell the project to an enemy nation, Harsha acted to protect the country, safeguarding the project. In retaliation, the enemy nation’s mercenaries killed Harsha’s family.

The government couldn’t help him seek justice: the project was classified, and targeting the enemy would expose it. Meanwhile, the corrupt superior escaped unscathed, even framing Harsha and getting him removed from the project, fearing he might expose him. Harsha spent four months in jail before Kabir bailed him out.

It was then that Harsha went rogue. Disillusioned, he concluded that mankind could never truly deliver justice without succumbing to emotion and power. Losing all faith in the system, he resolved to take justice into his own hands—on his own terms.

He also warns Shiva that The Silencer will relentlessly hunt them until the chip is recovered. Shiva reluctantly comes to understand that the only way out of this situation is to help Kabir take down Harsha. Just then, Raja, the loan shark who lent Shiva the money, calls him with a chilling ultimatum: he has kidnapped Seetha, and if Shiva wants his sister alive, he must repay the full amount within two hours.

Shiva and Kabir begin plotting a rescue mission to save Seetha from Raja. The rescue mission highlights their friction: Kabir plans a stealth approach using thermal imaging, but overcome with rage and desperation to save Seetha, Shiva throws caution aside, crashes a lorry through the wall of Raja’s house, and unleashes a brutal assault on him and his goons, proving that sometimes “Madras Rage” beats “London Logic.”

After securing Seetha in a safe house, Shiva promises to return to her soon and that he has some urgent work to tend to. While sharing a brief quiet moment, Shiva hands Seetha a cup of coffee and says, ""Here, an extra spoon of sugar, just how you like it,"" causing Seetha to frown and reply, ""Anna, I’ve always only taken one spoon of sugar... I don't take extra sugar."" Shiva apologises for the mix-up and says that he messed it up in a haste. Kabir tells Shiva that they depart for London to meet with Agent Zoya immediately and thus Shiva leaves for London. The journey from Chennai to London takes place aboard a rusting cargo freighter, as flying commercial would be too risky.

INTERVAL

In London, the plot deepens with the introduction of Zoya (29), Kabir’s former lover and partner, who believes Kabir is a traitor. Although Kabir was the original architect of the system, Harsha has revoked all of Kabir’s digital credentials, as he is officially deceased. If Kabir tries to hack the Harsha network using his old codes, the system will instantly flag the login as a “Ghost Event” and trigger a lockdown. Therefore, Kabir turns to Zoya who possesses “Legacy Access” as she was his former partner. (Legacy Access refers to backdoor clearance codes that Harsha hasn’t found or deleted yet) They need her specific login credentials to even get near the firewall without setting off alarms.

The meeting takes place in a safe house—a derelict clocksmith’s workshop in East London, filled with ticking noise. Zoya, now a rogue agent living off the grid, has Shiva at gunpoint once he enters. To her, Shiva is an intruder or a mercenary sent by Harsha. Shiva tries to explain his situation in broken English and panic, waving his hands and shouting, “Chip! Head! Kabir!”, but he sounds insane. Zoya tightens her finger on the trigger, convinced this is a trap.

With seconds to spare, Kabir commands Shiva to surrender control. The transformation is terrifyingly physical: the frantic, hunch-shouldered desperation of the Chennai street-fighter evaporates, replaced instantly by a cold, weary stillness. Shiva’s head tilts with a microscopic familiarity that freezes Zoya in place. When he speaks, it isn’t Shiva’s panic, but Kabir’s soft, accented Russian: “You’re aiming three inches left, Zoe. You always pull left when you’re tired.” The critique hits her like a physical blow. He steps into the gun, recounting a private memory of rain in Paris, whispering, “I took the bullet so you wouldn’t have to.” Zoya, trembling, lowers the weapon and reaches out to touch the face of a stranger, momentarily reunited with the dead. But the intimacy is brutally severed; the “Overwrite” warning spikes, forcing a violent disconnect. Shiva gasps, slumping back into his confused, local persona, asking in Tamil, “Did she shoot?” Zoya recoils, left staring at a man who looks nothing like her lover, realizing with devastating clarity that Kabir is just a ghost in the machine.

Kabir then explains the situation to her and she agrees to help them. They begin the “Symbiosis Training” for Shiva. The sequence begins with physical comedy as Kabir attempts to overwrite Shiva’s “Madras muscle memory.” Shiva’s natural gait is a loose-limbed, shoulder-swinging swagger—a “mass walk” designed to intimidate locals. Kabir, projecting a digital “Green Line” via the Augmented Reality (AR) overlay, forces Shiva to walk a tightrope of sophistication. Every time Shiva’s shoulder dips or his stride widens into a strut, Kabir blasts a jarring “ERROR” buzzer in his ears. The friction peaks during the “Dining Drill”. Shiva, who believes food lacks “soul” unless eaten with his hands, is forced to navigate the geometry of a knife and fork. Kabir treats the cutlery like weapons, explaining the tactile precision required to cut a steak without making a sound against the plate. Shiva fails repeatedly, sending a potato flying across the room, leading to a heated argument where Shiva yells at the air, “If I can kill a man with a tea glass, why does it matter how I hold a spoon?”

The training shifts from physical to cerebral over the next few days. Kabir introduces the concept of ""Micro-Expression Suppression."" He explains that VEDHA (Silas’s AI) does not listen to words; it reads the involuntary twitch of the Levator muscle in the upper lip or the dilation of pupils—signals of fear or deceit that occur in 1/25th of a second. To counter this, Kabir initiates the ""Mirror Drill."" Shiva stands before a bathroom mirror while Kabir projects a ""Bio-metric Grid"" over Shiva’s reflection. The goal is to endure a psychological interrogation without triggering a red alert on the grid. Kabir (the voice) begins to ruthlessly provoke Shiva, insulting his intelligence, his poverty, and mocking his inability to protect his sister, Seetha.

Initially, Shiva fails miserably. Every time Kabir mentions Seetha, Shiva’s nostrils flare in anger, and the AR grid flashes ""DETECTED."" Kabir warns him, ""In the server room, that flare gets you executed."" To survive, Kabir teaches Shiva the ""Dissociation Technique""—the art of separating the face from the feeling. He instructs Shiva to focus on a mundane memory—the sound of the ceiling fan in his old house—while his mouth speaks lies. The sequence culminates in a tense moment where Shiva finally cracks the code. Kabir insults him viciously, but Shiva’s face remains a mask of polite, stony indifference. The AR grid stays green. Shiva has learned to lie not just with his words, but with his biology. He hasn't become a spy; he has become an actor, capable of burying his rage under a layer of ice, a skill that transforms him from a street brawler into a lethal infiltrator ready for London.

But upon passing the test, Shiva suddenly loses consciousness and blacks out. Zoya revives him and examines the key, only to make a grim discovery. The Quantum Key is expanding in Shiva’s brain. Every time Shiva sleeps or lets Kabir take control, the chip deletes ""non-essential data"" to create space; his memories are being deleted. Shiva understands, with growing dread, that forgetting how to touch his father’s photograph and how Seetha likes her coffee isn’t random—it’s his memories slowly slipping away. The next day, Shiva wakes up realizing he cannot remember the chorus of his favorite song, cementing the tragic cost of his heroism: he is fighting to save a world he is slowly forgetting. The trio realise that they have to act fast and that Kabir cannot take control of him too often as it poses a risk of losing Shiva entirely.

To destroy VEDHA, the trio must infiltrate ""The Blackbox,"" Harsha's subterranean server farm. This plays out as a dense, three-stage heist. First, Shiva needs to infiltrate a high-society auction using social engineering to steal a retina scan from Harsha's snobbish Art-Collector CFO, Scott. Kabir’s tactical plan involves a silent entry through the ventilation shafts to deploy a drone, but Shiva rejects it, arguing that ""in Chennai, if you want to steal, you walk in the front door like you own the place."" Clad in a tuxedo paired with jarringly bright aviators, Shiva crashes the gala posing as an eccentric crypto-billionaire from South India. While Kabir feeds Shiva technical data about the paintings to sound sophisticated, Shiva ignores him and instead uses ""Mass"" psychology: he loudly insults the CFO’s taste, calling the million-dollar centerpiece ""garbage."" The insult baits Scott’s ego perfectly. Shiva claims to possess a ""rare red diamond"" (actually a polished shard of a brake light he found in the alley) and challenges Scott to appraise it. He hands Scott a specialized jeweler's loupe—which Zoya has rigged with a high-speed retinal scanner. As the arrogant CFO leans in, squinting into the lens to mock the fake gem, the device silently maps his eye. Shiva retrieves the ""diamond,"" delivers a nonsensical but profound-sounding punchline in Tamil about ""true value,"" and vanishes into the crowd before Scott realizes he has been played, leaving Kabir stunned that pure confidence outmaneuvered a million dollars of security.

Next, the duo faces the ""Aero-Static Corridor,"" a security tunnel lined with thermal lasers and air-displacement sensors so sensitive that even the heave of a chest breathing can trigger the alarm. Kabir projects the ""Safe Path"" via the HUD—a complex, gymnastic route requiring flips and contortions that Shiva’s heavy, brawler physique physically cannot perform. However, Kabir calculates a problem: even if he pilots the body, Shiva’s panic-induced heart rate and rapid breathing will trip the air sensors. This is where Shiva takes charge. He closes his eyes, mentally transporting himself back to the deep, silent waters of the Bay of Bengal where he spent years free-diving to untangle fishing nets. He initiates a ""Breath-Hold"" technique (Apnea), forcing his heart rate to drop to a near-comatose rhythm. With Shiva’s lungs turned to stone and his mind in a meditative ""Zero-Oxygen"" state, Kabir takes control of the limbs. The sequence is a mesmerizing, silent ballet: Kabir executes impossible mid-air twists and spinal contortions to slip through the laser webs, while Shiva provides the superhuman endurance to hold the position without a single molecule of air escaping his lips. They glide through the death trap not as a spy or a thug, but as a single, breathless organism, clearing the grid seconds before Shiva finally gasps, collapsing on the other side.

The final obstacle is the ""Kinetic Hall,"" a fifty-foot corridor lined with floor-embedded pressure sensors and lateral cameras designed to identify personnel by the unique ""skeletal rhythm"" of their walk. Shiva’s natural, heavy-footed ""Madras slouch"" triggers an immediate lockdown warning. Kabir calculates the biometrics required to mimic the CFO’s stiff, aristocratic strut but delivers a devastating prognosis: the ""Simulation Drive"" requires massive RAM, and the only available space lies in Shiva’s core memory sector. Shiva, staring at the sealed blast door, whispers, ""Take it."" As Kabir seizes control, forcing Shiva’s hips and spine into an unnatural, precise cadence, the tragedy plays out in the HUD. Shiva fights to focus on his sister’s face, repeating her name—Seetha, Seetha, Seetha—like a mantra. But as the hallway lights turn green signaling ""ACCESS GRANTED,"" the neural overwrite completes. The syllables dissolve into static. Shiva steps through the door, physically triumphant but mentally hollowed, turning to Zoya with wide, panicked eyes to whisper, ""I know she is my sister... but I don't know what to call her."" Zoya tells him that his sister’s name is Seetha and calms him down.

They breach the Central Core, expecting banks of humming servers, but are met with a chilling, sterile silence. The room is empty save for a single monitor displaying a live feed of the Chennai tea shop where Shiva was first hunted. Harsha's voice booms over the intercom, revealing the heist was never a secret; he anticipated Zoya’s ""Legacy Access"" and used the security protocols as a funnel to deliver the Biometric Key directly to him. Before the realization can fully settle, the shadows in the rafters detach themselves. The Silencer drops behind Zoya with the silence of a spider. In one fluid, brutal motion, he shatters her kneecap with a telescopic baton, dropping the trained agent before she can even raise her weapon. Shiva, disoriented by the fresh memory purge and the sudden violence, tries to brawl, but The Silencer anticipates his lunges. He deploys a high-voltage neural net that locks Shiva’s muscles in agonizing paralysis, leaving the hero helpless on the floor, staring at his fallen ally as the extraction team moves in. 

Harsha reveals his masterstroke: VEDHA is already active as during the tea stall brawl, The Silencer managed to seize a small fragment of the device that had broken off and that Harsha had enough power to control Tamil Nadu’s power grid. He threatens to shut off hospital incubators all over Chennai unless Kabir unlocks the key. Harsha straps Shiva into a ""Neural Separator"" to forcefully extract the data and Kabir’s consciousness, a process that will leave Shiva lobotomized. The battle moves to a surreal ""Mind Palace""—a crumbling version of Chennai where Shiva fights shadow monsters while his memories dissolve into pixels. Kabir, witnessing Shiva’s struggle to hold onto the fading memory of his sister, realizes that ""Logic"" would surrender, but ""Love"" fights.

Kabir makes the ultimate sacrifice, overriding the extraction process to initiate a ""System Purge."" He tells Shiva, ""The world has enough spies; it needs a brother,"" and uploads a virus attached to his own consciousness, deleting himself to burn VEDHA from the inside. Shiva wakes up as the servers fry, but Harsha unleashes his final defense: ""Haptic-Sync Droids,"" biomechanical super-soldiers that predict martial arts moves. The droids initially dominate, countering Kabir’s textbook style. However, Shiva enters a ""Hybrid State."" He utilizes Kabir’s reflex speed but fights with his own chaotic, dirty street tactics—biting, using wires to strangle, and throwing debris. The droids’ HUDs flash ERROR: PATTERN UNKNOWN as they fail to compute his improvisation. 

The final boss fight sees Shiva brawling with The Silencer and Harsha in the collapsing server room. After a long and stylishly executed battle, he manages to overpower and knock them down. Shiva then smirks at them and says, “Even the perfect AI can’t match an imperfect human”, as he delivers the killing blow. Shiva rescues Zoya and escapes as the building falls. 

SCREEN FADES TO BLACK

SCREEN READS: FEW DAYS LATER

Shiva is back in Chennai and has paid off his debts and rebuilt his home using the money Zoya transferred him from Harsha’s account. He tears up when he hugs Seetha, realizing he remembers her and promises to never leave her side again. He then sheepishly checks a mirror, hoping to see his friend, but sees only his own reflection. This causes a great deal of disappointment to Shiva who realises that he misses his buddy. Dejected, he walks away when a cup falls from a table. Without looking, Shiva catches it with terrifying, robotic precision—a subtle confirmation that while the ghost is gone, the skills remain.

1pkdj4j,https://i.redd.it/0frt868jyn6g1.jpeg,La Reina de Cafe esta aqui! The Tekken Nerf Series Episode 3: Azucena!,"If you couldn't figure out the order of the characters, I'm going in order from the Character Customization Menu. Anyway, the most consistent nerf suggested for Asuka was either a damage nerf (I agree) and frame advantage reduction on some of her key moves like fc df3 or d1+2. Some Asuka players chimed with a whole wishlist of nerfs. Good, more interactions like that please! 

If you haven't seen the first two episodes of the Nerf Series, the premise is simple. I ask of you, lovely folk, a simple task. In the comment section, give me a nerf for our focused character. Today, we're looking at the Coffee Queen, Azucena. One nerf, a cavalcade of nerfs, however many you want. Some rules of the trade so we don't have a war below:

1.) You CANNOT gut the character's identity with the nerf/nerfs you suggest.

2.) REMOVING THE CHARACTER CANNOT BE THE NERF YOU SUGGEST. It's not realistic in this discussion's context.

3.) Try and keep the nerf/nerfs character specific. A lot of the suggested nerfs for Alisa were excellent, but there were some nerfs that were pretty general. A lot of the cast needs nerfs, but to keep the series engaging, try to specify it to the character we're talking about. 

So, how would I nerf Azucena? Well, here's the thing.

I had two ideas in mind. The first idea I had was to nerf her backswing blow, only for me to realize in Training mode that when poorly spaced, it's -16. Which means that I've been letting Azucena players get away with murder since the game launch (I suck). 

The second nerf I had in mind was to nerf FC df3 by making it stagger her on block. Only for me to realize that it's -15 on block bc it doesn't transition into Libertador. So, for the first time in the series, I got nothing. But that coincides with why I decided to do this series.

Nerfing a character isn't easy. It's a slippery slope if you go too far, you'll kill the character (Devil Jin can relate), but if you don't go far enough, the community as a whole won't be pleased (S2's launch can relate).

But you lovely folk are NOT me. So how would you all nerf Azucena? Or would you nerf her at all? Let's have at it! Bryan is tomorrow's character and I know what I'd do to nerf him and I assume you all do too. With how fast y'all were coming up with the Alisa and Asuka nerfs, I'm starting to think you were all sitting on these ideas since the game launch, lol.

See y'all tomorrow at 7 PM EST!",11,1765498822.0,LowSodiumTEKKEN,8,1.0,False

I’m begging for tips, tricks, empathy
anything to soften the blur.
We’re running on fumes, half dreams,
and cold coffee that doesn’t work anymore.

Somewhere around week twelve,
right after we thought
we’ve got this,
our tiny predictable world cracked open.
Two feeds a night, down easy in the bassinet
then overnight, chaos.
Naps? A myth.
Daytime turned to dread,
the hours stretched between cries and rocking.

By week thirteen, bedtime joined the rebellion.
An hour long protest,
sweet face streaked with tears
ours too sometimes.
“Six weeks of hell,”
I whispered into the dark,
like a prayer I didn’t mean to say aloud.

Week fifteen came shouting
wake ups now whenever he pleased.
Night and day blurred,
each feeding running into another.
Still six weeks of hell.

Week sixteen brought a twist
rolling, tumbling, growing,
“progression,” they call it.
But all I saw were thirty minute naps
and a baby who needed me
every time the world tilted wrong.
Still six weeks of hell.

Seventeen weeks
crib refusal season.
Lay him down, eyes spring open.
Nap trapped, four times a day,
with aching arms and a heart too full to complain.

Split nights, teething,
rolling, stuck again,
every book devoured, every post read,
every room darkened, every sound machine humming.
We’ve done it all.
Still six weeks of hell.

Last night, maybe the worst
every hour, wide eyes and cries.
Pick up, rock, repeat.
Little body fighting sleep,
jerking, stirring,
restless in dreams I’d trade anything to calm.

Now twenty weeks,
almost twenty one.
He smiles at the sun, bubbles giggles
even when his eyes are red with tired.
And me?
I’m half soul, half sleep deprived ghost,
wholly in love with this tiny human
who’s rewriting every rhythm I ever knew.

It’s been six weeks of hell.
And somehow, heaven too.

i tend to use the walk up line for drops because the drive thru can get crazy. so me, and about 20 other people at this point, have formed a line near the walk up window. its about 2:30 when this lady comes up to the window in front of everyone to order, not a problem, we all know some people just want to get their coffee and avoid the drop all together. tell me why this girl proceeds to not order and sit there chatting with the broista for about fifteen minutes, very obviously trying to run down the timer. it became very apparent that she was NOT trying to order - she cut in front of every single person that had been waiting in line for 30 minutes or more. 

there were quite a few people behind me in the front of the line that started calling her out on it, getting understandably upset, letting the broistas know. the staff did absolutely NOTHING and just shrugged it off, let her do what she was doing. did we not learn how to line up in kindergarten? do we not have any basic respect? is it just okay for the staff to allow this type of behavior? 

personally ive never had a drop cause so much drama. its always been pretty chill, having friendly conversations while people wait in line and setting up trades so that people can leave with full sets. dutch bros merch drops are really starting to get sooo out of hand, between them being overhyped, over crowded, and scalpers reselling at insane prices.

This is for me finally speaking the truth, but understanding that I'm not angry at you either. This is me finally feeling...myself and having clarity. I found the Facebook posts back in August and knew you were living with your ex when we met, and I chose to trust you’d come forward to me eventually and be honest with me. But instead you you broke up, and said it was me, “going too fast” and our “timelines” didn’t align. And you’re likely off telling people that I was too fast, too anxious. But my anxiety had a point. I know. I knew. And I didn’t confront that reality with you the one time I had the chance when you left a small door open. The wild thing is, if you came back, I might even welcome it. I don’t know – that’s why this has been so difficult to overcome. Because I used to be you, and would have talked you through it all.

We met here, on Reddit of all places, at the end of our 1L year. Completely by chance. Both 30-something law students, struggling to find romantic relationships in school. You said you were just single after breaking up with your boyfriend of 4 years, even though you hated to leave the dogs, you needed your own path. We bonded right away over our mutual love of gaming, anime; you were a scrappy cute redhead (who streamed, what!) and said I was okay too. Both being 2Ls who were older and wanting more out of life and—lo and behold—we were within a reasonable days drive. For me, having just moved that seemed impossible. What are the odds. It seemed to me like fate. I was doomed to fall for you from the start, and I did. And I don't regret it.

We talked every day after we exchanged numbers. Did you know on our phone alone we had over 17,000 messages? I didn’t. So even though our relationship was only 5 months, it felt like years. Every time we met was electric. Every physical moment together felt unmatchable. You literally bragged to friends about me and I was glowing from it.

Then law school for 2L started. I met your best friend after I had already bribed her with my homemade cheesecake. We built her couch together, had pizza, and all seemed amazing. You shared me to your mom when you visited her out of state. I thought we were at the same place as I had arrived – love. I didn’t say I love you, but I alluded to it. And then the descent began. You turned your head, almost in shame, and told me “I’m just going to pretend I don’t know what that means.” I don’t think I can describe the punch to the gut that was for me.

The last month together was agony. Our last visit almost felt like strangers cuddling. I felt like you were intentionally hiding me from the world; telling me to stay in the car when we got coffee; pulling back from photos at the last hike we did; cancelling our movie date out in public to stay in instead.

We had both done some snooping with our friends on socials. What you didn’t know is I saw the Facebook posts. Where your ex and you were living together when we met. That you didn’t move out until after we met and slept together. I didn’t know what to think because I was already enmeshed. Trauma bonded or madly in love, I don’t know anymore.  And I wish I had spoken up. Because I used to be like you. So afraid of loving another person that I kept people away. Self-sabotaging the very thing I wanted to find – love.

I can’t describe what happened next. My body felt like every nerve and bone were breaking. ChatGPT said the amount we talked registered in my brain like 4 years’ worth of talking compared to normal for me. I withered away awhile; lost weight; felt empty. Even on my 34th birthday, 2 months to the day you ended things, I suddenly felt worthless and had to hide crying from my dad and friend on the golf course. Then it really just hit me in waves.

But the truth is you inspired me to change myself in ways you’ll likely never see. To never hold back a gut feeling. To offer empathy but still hold firm. You killed the last of the man that doesn’t speak up, the child afraid to stand for their needs. I still care for you, I do. But people like us, people that have been hurt, need to grow, not grow up but heal. You are not always the victim. You can also hurt people, and your patterns are doing just that. And that is ok, if you can actually own up to it, learn from it, and heal.

I hope you do heal. That you can find love you never got growing up. But you have to sit in the shame first, alone, in order to heal. There is more for me to work on too, I know. But this is my goodbye to the relationship, even though I thought it was the one.",1,1765498017.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too.

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Palworld and Ark ASA. Just bought Dinkum, too. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies.",0,1765497983.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False

401k - $31k, from previous jobs. I’ve consolidated in one account from several corporate jobs 

Cash savings - $16k, I threw a ton of money at savings this year since I’m not paying rent. Before starting this job last November, I have maybe $250 in savings. 

Income 

Full time paycheck - $4,610/month after taxes, I make $33/hour and I’m paid twice a month. I have guaranteed hours, meaning I’m paid 40 a week even if they don’t use all the hours. Instead of calculating the hours every week, I keep track throughout a full month and if I’m getting close to 160 at the end of the month, I warn nanny mom and she decides if they want to pay for overtime or just pull back on hours. My contact includes being available to watch the kids overnight at least 4 nights a month but the nanny parents prefer to avoiding overtime so I’ll just have more time off around those nights. 

Part time job \~ $1,000/year, sometimes I pick up babysitting gigs or will watch nanny parents friend’s kids in addition to my normal nanny kids 

Debts 

Hospital stay - $2,819, I stayed overnight due to a health scare earlier this year and make a $250/month payment. I could pull from my savings and pay it off in full but there is no interest so I just make these payments

No other debt! I paid off my students loans in October and my (VERY) stupid car repossession debt from 2018 in August. I had a total of $15k loans and paid for the rest of school with scholarships. 

Expenses 

Prime/kindle unlimited - $30

Car insurance - $118.50, my car was a 30th birthday gift from my grandpa last year. I’m incredibly thankful for it. It’s 10 years old but runs beautifully and mechanics compliment it whenever I bring it in for maintenance

Cell phone - $60, paid to my mom 

Car wash subscription- $37, dumb? Maybe but I love it and the amount of sand that ends up in my back seat makes it worth it to me for the vacuums 

All other subscriptions are from family members! 

I had a money diary published on Refinery29 in 2018 if you want to see the changes in my finances almost a decade later, I’ll put the link in the comments. 

Important people 

A - 5 year old girl I nanny 

B - 3 year old boy I nanny 

C - my boyfriend who lives in my private casita as well 

E - my dog 

Day 1 

6:30 - alarm goes off and I go to check on my dog. He had a pretty major dental surgery 2 days ago and since he’s an old guy I’ve been worried (it was $1,605 for the surgery but I paid in full two days ago so not technically in this diary). He is fine and wags his tail at me a bit before laying back down. He knows the routine and waits until after school drop off to truly wake up. I get myself dressed and ready for the day before walking over to big house to wake up the kids. 

8 - after feeding them breakfast, getting them dressed, and doing their hair, both kids are ready for school so I drop them off and head straight home. I run into nanny mom and tell her about our morning before heading to my casita to have breakfast and coffee with my boyfriend (C) and check on E again. 

9:30 - I realize my new contract has been sent to me by nanny dad and they are offering me a $1/hour raise! They want to add a few more tasks around the house since the kids are in preschool 5 days a week now. Many tasks I’m already doing occasionally anyway so I’m fine with all of them except adding on parents laundry so I respond asking to remove that part. I hear back quickly and they accept removing that. The raise will start on my next check! 

11 - I get a few chores done around the my casita before I check the big house to make a grocery list and head to target. For the nanny family I buy berries, eggos, cream cheese, Christmas themed travel friendly crafts, 4 sketch pads, 2 packs of new markers, 6 books to start the book advent calendar I’m making them, cold brew, whole milk, and chicken nuggets. Their total was $143.53. I grab coffee creamer, Draino, and dry shampoo for myself at $30.92. I stop by Hawaiian Bro’s for lunch for myself and C for $25.63

1:15 - Head back to the big house to really get work started for the day. I wash the berries and unpack the markers on the craft table. The cleaning ladies came today so I don’t need to clean anything but I do put a few things in their proper spots. I also place an Amazon order for water wipes, stain removed refill, cardboard cutter, contact paper, curtain rod, and curtains for my casita. I charge it all to my work card, the total $129.01

2:30 - I picked up the kids from school and take them to the children’s museum. We have a membership here but it expired last week so I pay to renew it, $189 on my work card 

6 - after playing at the museum for a while and coming home to relax and have a snack, the kids and I make banana bread after saying goodbye to their mom. While the bread bakes, I make dinner and load/unload the dishwashers, there’s two so one pretty much always needs some attention. Their dad gets home and brings them fries to add to their dinner of protein Mac and cheese. He also tells me that he had a lawyer at his company draw up our new contract and apologized for not seeing the part about the parent’s laundry. I was pretty clear about that before I started. 

7:30 - I do bath time before tucking both kids into beds, I stick around to make sure they fall asleep since their mom is still gone.  I make my to do list for tomorrow and tidy the kitchen a bit more before I head to my casita for the night. My boyfriend makes a pasta dish for dinner and that we eat with Great British Bake off before reading our books in bed. I’m reading Their War by Invi Wright and he is reading a new One Piece volume. Head to sleep around 10:30. 

Day 2 

6:30 - another day the same routine. Only change this morning was drying off dinosaurs that have been growing in a bowl of water for 2 days. 

9:30 - I started a load of laundry before I went back to my casita to lay in bed for a while. I was going to make coffee but the French press is in the dishwasher and I don’t feel like dealing with it so I drive to Starbucks. I get a caramel burlee latte and oatmeal and I grab a black drip coffee for C. The total was $14.98 but I just loaded $25 on to my Starbucks card. 

10:30 - the kids school sent out an email saying all of their things need to be labeled with first and last names. I know some of the kids stuff is labeled correctly but some isn’t and some only has their first names so I just order a pack of personalized labels for each kid to make this easier. I also order more kids tooth paste so my total is $82.35 on my work card. 

1:45 - the nanny mom had some friends over to play mah-jongg so I stayed in my casita for the morning but as I’m walking through the house to go to school pickup, she stops me and says she wants to go get them and asks me to pick them up from tennis lessons at 4:45 instead. I spend a bit of time picking up around the house and switch the laundry before heading back to my casita. I was worried about leaving my dog for so long anyway since C has work today. 

3 - I text with my mom about Christmas a bit. Since I was a teenage, she’s made us pick out 4 presents that fit into 4 categories, want, need, read, and wear and she’s requesting my list for this year. Read is easy, I’m collecting the Ice Planet Barbarian books so I just pick the next one I need. The other categories are harder. I finally just say I want some gold flat back stud earrings and she can pick the other two or spend more money on those. 

3:30 - run to the pharmacy for two prescriptions, $122.67. I also decide that I want to make crunch wraps for dinner so I grab ingredients for that and a few clearance Halloween candies at the Safeway next door, $29.82 

4:45 - head to the country club to watch A’s tennis lesson while B runs around the courts and their mom heads to get her nails done. We head home afterwards to ride bikes. 

6 - make dinner and chat with nanny dad while they eat. He asks if I know why Target stocks would be dropping and seems impressed that I knew right away, thanks TikTok I guess lol. 

6:45 - I get started on bath time but their dad takes over and tells me I can go home. I stick around for a few extra minutes to clean up the kitchen and start the dish washer. I run into nanny mom as she gets home and she tells me that nanny dad pissed her off earlier today so he is doing bath time to get back on her good side. Sometimes this job is hilarious. 

7:15 - C is at work still so things go off the walls a little bit. I order 4 new pairs of leggings from American eagle for $122.56. From Amazon I order a new pair of ASICS NovaBlasts, these are my favorite everyday work shoes, and a zip up hoodie on Black Friday sale for C and me for $144.67. 

7:45 - C comes home and I make amazing crunch wraps for dinner but when we feed E dinner and give him his pills, he refuses to eat the new can of wet food. Worried the pills will make him sick if he doesn’t eat, we go to target to get new food for him to try like the spoiled prince he is. I also buy cookie dough and ice cream to make ice cream sandwiches plus a bunch of other random things I probably don’t need, $63.46. When we get home, E had finished the wet food anyway.

10:45 - we finished the evening with another GBBO episode and books in bed. I finish my book and C finishes another volume of One Piece. 

Day 3 

6:30 - another day another school rush but with the added benefit of their past nanny coming into town late last night to stay for a few days so she keeps them entertained long enough for me to start a load of laundry in the washer before drop off. 

11 - the mom of B’s best friend comes by to drop something for nanny mom and I ask if she wants to drop off her kid for a playdate this afternoon. She jumps at the chance but says he’s with a babysitter for the afternoon so she’ll come along too to help out with the play date, which is fine, I won’t have to manage all 3 alone. I decide we’ll make pizzas together for dinner and place a pickup order for pizza dough and some snacks that need a refill, $31.46 on my work card. 

12:15 - C had left earlier to run a couple errands but starts work late today so he comes back home for lunch and I make fresh crunch wraps with the left overs from last night. 

1:30 - nanny mom is taking the kids to an appointment right after school meaning I’m off until 2:30 today so I go to grab my pickup order but run inside to get a Monster and some folders for C’s cover letter for a new position he is applying for. Head home and prep a Thanksgiving craft for the kids to do this afternoon. $6.43

3 - the kids get home at the exact same time the friend shows up for the play date. The babysitter is nice, she’s a staggering 10 years younger than me so it’s fun to hear about what’s going on in college nowadays. I just remember when I was babysitting kids 10 years younger than me lol. 

6:30 - Nanny parents leave for a concert for the night while we are making our pizza. The babysitter and other kid get picked up right after dessert then it’s just me and the nanny kids for evening. Bedtime is fine as a whole but it does involve a poop not taken in a toilet. I’ll just leave it at that. 

11 - after the kids go to sleep, I fold more laundry and pick up a bit before I sit on the couch and read until they get home around 10:45. I moved on to Chev’s Mate, the next book in The Female series. It’s not incredible but it’s fun enough that I keep going. C gets home at 11 bringing chick fil a with him for both of us. We eat and I crash right away but I feel like he finishes another volume. 

Day 4

8:30 - get up, give E his meds and take him outside. His energy is really coming back which is so nice to see that I could cry. It’s Saturday and I have the morning off but it still won’t be kid free. My best friend has 3 kids right around the ages of the kids I nanny, which makes it fun for play dates but also means some of my off time involves similar activities. This morning her oldest son has a soccer game and I have the time go this week so I get up and head there. I stop for at Starbucks on the drive, it’s $12 but I pay with the money I added earlier this week.  

11:30 - I was going to grab lunch with them but as we are leaving the coach asks if her oldest can go to the next game for the team a year older. They had a few kids call out sick and won’t be able to play if he can’t find someone to fill in. I don’t have time for two games today so say my goodbyes… until my best friend locks her keys in the car. She ends up sending all 3 kids to the next game with her in-laws and I sit with her until roadside assistances comes to save her. 

12:30 - stop at target on the way home. For the nanny family I get mini chomps, a new coloring book for our trip, and wrapping paper for the advent calendar at $32.66. For myself I get shampoo, face wash, frozen beef and broccoli, protein shake, and some candy for the plane at $52.78

2:30 - I stopped at Chipotle on the way home, $14.51 and eat in the casita before I walk back to the big house for work today. I start packing the kids’ suitcase for tomorrow but at a certain point it’s clear that the kids need to run off some energy. Since it’s pouring rain, I take them to an indoor play ground nearby, $60.53. 

6 - I let the kids pick a treat as we leave so we get 2 icees for B and me and a popsicle for A, $23.01. We drove nanny mom’s car and on the way home the gas light comes on so I stop to fill it for her, $94.03. I finish packing the kids while they eat dinner and the adults not overstimulated from the playground entertainment them. 

7:30 - Nanny mom lets me off early so I can finish packing myself. I feed E dinner/pills and fold the laundry C started before he left for work. Packing is relatively easy because we travel so often. When I first started with this family, I used to bring my routine with us, but now I just keep an extra set of full sized products ready to go at all times. It’s faster and easier when I’m back home and exhausted after a trip, I don’t have to unpack before I take a shower at home. 

9 - C gets home from work and I make beef and broccoli for dinner. We eat, talk about our days, and squeeze in the final GBBO episode before I get up and finish packing. We head to bed around 1am. 

Day 5 

7 - up and ready for a long travel. Once I have myself ready to go I add the last few things to my suitcase, C brings it to the big house while I say my goodbyes to E. My goodbye to C takes a bit longer. I travel all the time but saying goodbye to him is never easy but this trip I’m missing Thanksgiving which makes it a little bit harder but I manage to head to big house shortly after. 

10:30 - time this morning has been a blur but before I know it we are on the plane heading to Mexico. We had breakfast in the airport lounge and nanny dad bought me a water bottle but I don’t know the price. 

2 - the flight was delayed while we were sitting on the runway and B spilled his whole water bottle on his seat/lap so we had to change his full outfit immediately after takeoff. Never a dull day but I did finish Chev’s mate right as the plane was landing. I can’t decide if I’m going to read the final book in the series yet. Once we land, nanny dad handles all the passport/customs and buys nanny mom and me a margarita while we wait for the car to pick us up. Again, no idea the price. You’ll notice that I don’t get a lot of prices during this trip lol. 

3:30 - arrive at the resort and get handed another small margarita to drink while we walk to our room. If I’m slightly disappointed by the size, it’s not for long because another pitcher of margaritas awaits us in our room. As soon as the suitcases arrive, I help the kids change and oversee swim time in the private pool while sipping a fresh margarita. 

5:45 - we walk over to dinner at one of the resort restaurants. I forgot to write down the prices but I had 2 mocktails and enchiladas, they were all very good. The kids run a muck but we came so early there’s no one else around and it’s a very kid friendly place. In fact, we make the kids sit down a couple times, worried that they are being too rambunctious, and the wait staff insists that they get up to come look at something shortly afterwards. 

7 - I wasn’t technically working while we were at dinner so I’m even more off duty now we are back in the suite so I lay in my bed listening to the ‘docile’ sounds of bedtime and accidentally fall asleep with all the lights on. 

9:30 - C calls me when he gets home from work, waking me from my accidental nap, and we talk for about 30 minutes. I actually get ready for bed and fall back to sleep immediately. 

Day 6 

10 - I woke up a couple of times to the kids yelling about something but I have the morning off so I manage to mostly sleep until 10 before I get up and head to the small market at the resort to grab an iced mocha. This was $8.23 with tip but I charge it to the room. The kids spy me walking by at the pool and A convinces me to throw her in a few times before I head to the room for a breakfast of a bagel and banana. There’s a small kitchen in the room and nanny dad always orders some groceries for our time here so we don’t eat out for every meal. I also appreciate this so I can have snacks between meals. The nanny parents eat like birds and the only bird I could compare myself to would be a pterodactyl. I eat on the patio and ultimately decide to start Queens by Invi Wright to just finish out the series. 

12 - I start work by giving the kids Christmas activity books I found at target. Their parents are heading to a grocery store for a few more essentials while we are here. They jump between coloring and the private pool for about an hour and a half before I start quiet time in the suite. Their parents get back at 2, bringing me a chicken sandwich and take over quiet time so I take a nap after I eat. 

5:15 - I wake up around 4:30 but lay around scrolling on my phone and reading until I start work again at 5:15. Their mom asks me to work tomorrow and take Wednesday off instead. My normal days off are Sunday and Tuesday but travel days obviously can’t be days off. Their friends invited them on their yacht tomorrow (Tuesday) and she wants me to swim with them since she doesn’t like getting her hair wet plus they want to have dinner with their friends afterwards. That would be 7 working days in a row but I kind of want to go on the yacht anyway so I say yes. 

7:30 - I take the kids to the park at the resort and fed them frozen pizza and asparagus for dinner before doing the whole bedtime routine. My biggest tip for traveling with kids this age is the Libby app. Every night I put them to bed, we read a book each, including one I pick, to get to at least 30 minutes a night, but there’s no way I’m bringing that many books on a trip. So I have the Libby app on my iPad and they each get to pick a book from there each night. Just make sure to select ‘available now’ to avoid seeing books they can’t really pick and you have full color basically full page books. After I clean up a bit before reading on the couch until the parents are back around 10. I get ready for bed and call C for about 45 minutes before going to sleep. 

Day 7 

8:15 - the kids are up sometime around 7 I think but I manage to sleep in until E’s vet calls to check in on him. I talk to her for a bit before getting up and getting coffee and a banana. Someone made coffee in the suite so I have that and also a liquid IV since we will be on the boat all day. Nanny mom also brings me an iced latte from the market for the drive to the docks. 

10 - by 10am we are on the boat heading to the famous Cabo arch and I have a mimosa in my hand. 

11 - we anchor near a beach to snorkel around. Both kids refuse getting in because there’s so many fish around but there’s no way I’m missing this opportunity so I jump straight in and let the kids direct me around the boat to get to the most fish. 

12:30 - we have lunch on the boat of salads, tacos, quesadillas, and chicken fingers. I also have a tequila sunrise while we head back to the marina. 

2:30 - once we get back to the resort, I make the kids a small snack before everyone scatters for a nap. A goes with their parents but B goes with me and somehow we all sleep until 5pm. 

5:15 - take the kids down to the beach to look for seashells until the sun is actually gone. Nanny parents decided not go to out for dinner so nanny dad was cooking dinner when we got back. We all hang out together in until about 7:45 when I head into my room to read. 

9 - talk to C about our days for about an hour and go to sleep thinking about my glorious day off tomorrow. 

Total expenses for the week - $638.45 

Reflection - this is a slightly more expensive week for me. I pay most of my bills in the beginning of the month so I’m a little more free with my second check of month. When I first started this job, I really buckled down and saved as much as I could while aggressively paying off debts. Once those were paid off and my savings account hit $10k, I loosened up a little. Plus I don’t normally spend any money while on vacation with the family. I could use my time off to explore but I spent a lot of time solo traveling in my early 20s and now reading by the pool appeals to me a bit more. Plus it leaves me with more money to spend on vacations with my boyfriend/mom/friends. ",12,1765497801.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,2,1.0,False

It seems like a good way to actually meet other people going to FestForums, shared kitchens, casual morning coffees, easier coordination for rides, etc. Instead of just goin back to a solo hotel room. Houses are grouped by industry focus too, which is kinda cool.

Before taking his whole family to prepare for the wedding, he sent a text: “When we get back, this house won’t be yours anymore.” I stared at the message, then quietly made my own choice. A few days later, they returned—only to find the land completely bare. No house. No fence. No sign of anything. Their excitement evaporated. All they could whisper was: “Where… did it all go?” I sat in my car, lowered the window, watched their panic—and smiled.

When Daniel left me, he didn’t leave quietly. He packed his suitcases with the self-importance of a man convinced he deserved more, and walked out the door without looking back. A week later, he announced his engagement to Sofia, a woman he had apparently been seeing long before our divorce was even finalized. I wasn’t surprised; betrayal rarely comes alone—it usually brings arrogance with it. But what truly shook me wasn’t his leaving. It was the message he sent right before taking his entire family to another state to prepare for the wedding.

“When we get back, this house won’t be yours anymore.”

Just that. No explanation. No courtesy. Not even the pretense of fairness. I stared at the text for a long minute, my hands steady, my pulse strangely calm. Daniel had always believed that intimidation was a form of communication. And for years, I let him think it worked.

But this time, I made a different choice.

The house—**my** house—stood on a plot of land left to me by my grandmother. Daniel had contributed nothing to its construction except criticism. Still, I knew exactly what his text meant: he had manipulated some legal loophole, likely twisting my earlier trust into paperwork I had signed too quickly. His confidence in his own schemes was almost insulting, as if I hadn’t learned anything from a decade beside him.

So while he was gone, I hired a crew. Not a demolition crew—Daniel would have expected that. No, I hired structural movers, specialists who could lift an entire house and transport it elsewhere. It cost nearly everything in my savings, but it was legal, clean, and most importantly, poetic.

On the morning before they were scheduled to return, the land stood empty. No house. No fence. Nothing but bare soil and an unfamiliar stillness. I parked my car down the road and waited, hands wrapped around a lukewarm coffee.

Their cars arrived in a small parade of celebration—until the moment they saw the empty lot. Doors flung open. Voices rose. Confusion tangled with panic. Daniel’s mother gasped. His brother cursed. And Daniel himself just stood there, staring at the barren ground as if someone had removed his future brick by brick.

Then he whispered, barely audible:

“Where… did it all go?”

I lowered my car window slowly… and smiled.



The first person to spot me was Claire, Daniel’s sister. Her expression shifted from disbelief to accusation within a heartbeat. “Is this your doing?” she demanded, pointing at the empty land like it had personally offended her.

I stepped out of the car, placing my sunglasses neatly on the roof. “The land is still here,” I said calmly. “Only the house is gone.”

Daniel stalked toward me, jaw clenched. “You can’t do this, Emily. This is illegal.”

“Actually,” I replied, handing him a neatly folded set of documents, “it isn’t. The house belongs to me. The land belongs to me. And the paperwork you tricked me into signing only transferred your *claim* to the land—claim, not ownership. Since there’s no land here for you to take, you’re claiming nothing.”

His face turned red, then pale, then something between the two. He scanned the papers with trembling hands. “You moved the whole house?”

“You said it wouldn’t be mine when you got back,” I said, shrugging. “So I made sure it wouldn’t be here at all.”

The truth was simpler than the drama implied: I had spent days preparing the move, relocating the house to a new plot of land I purchased under my maiden name. It was tucked safely in a quiet town an hour away. I planned to renovate it, repaint it, and give myself a fresh start—not out of spite, but out of liberation.

But watching Daniel’s fury twist into helplessness… I would be lying if I said it wasn’t satisfying.

His father stepped forward, calmer but no less angry. “You destroyed our family’s plans.”

“Your plans,” I corrected gently. “Not mine.”

Sofia, dressed far too elegantly for a return trip, stood beside Daniel, clutching his arm. “This is childish,” she hissed. “You’ve ruined everything.”

I tilted my head. “If everything can be ruined by the absence of a house, maybe it wasn’t much of a ‘forever’ to begin with.”

Silence fell over them. Heavy. Bitter. Honest.

I got back into my car, started the engine, and rolled the window down one last time. “You should talk to your lawyer,” I suggested kindly. “He’ll explain how loopholes work both ways.”

Then I drove off, leaving the empty land—and the people who never valued me—behind with the rest of the debris I no longer carried.

The drive to my new property felt strangely light, like shedding an old skin. The house—my house—was already being settled onto its new foundation when I arrived. The crew greeted me warmly, proud of their work. Watching the structure lower into place felt like placing a final piece in a long-unfinished puzzle.

Inside, dust still clung to the furniture and the floors creaked from the move, but it felt more like a fresh chapter than a disruption. I opened all the windows, letting sunlight pour in. For the first time in years, I breathed without tension pressing against my ribs.

Over the next few days, I repainted the living room, replaced old curtains, and rearranged the furniture. Every stroke of the brush felt symbolic—not of revenge, but of reclaiming space that had been gradually shrinking under Daniel’s shadow.

Friends who knew the whole story visited one afternoon, bringing wine and wide-eyed curiosity.

“You really moved the whole house?” Jenna asked, still in awe.

“Yes,” I said, pouring glasses. “Turns out it’s easier to relocate a house than to live with someone who thinks they own you.”

We laughed, and I realized how long it had been since laughter felt natural.

I received three text messages from Daniel over the next week. The first: angry. The second: pleading. The third: bitter resignation. I didn’t reply to any of them. Silence, I discovered, was its own form of closure.

One evening, as I sat on the front porch watching the sun sink behind the trees, I thought back to that moment on the empty lot, watching their shock ripple through the air. It wasn’t triumph I felt—it was clarity. I had spent so many years believing endurance was a virtue. But sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is walk away and take everything that belongs to you.

Including your peace.

Now, my house sits on a hill overlooking quiet streets. I planted a small garden out front, and every new sprout reminds me that starting over isn’t destruction—it’s growth.

And maybe that’s why I chose to share this story. Not to encourage revenge, but to remind someone—anyone—reading this that you’re allowed to take back your life, even if it means moving the entire foundation of it.

If you’ve ever had a moment when you finally stood up for yourself—or wished you had—tell me:

Spent a few hours today sifting through posts from the past two years and putting together a compilation post. Might be helpful to save this one and refer to it during difficult times. Thank you all for your involvement and dedication to helping each other. 


u/1_1_3_4 - My biggest recommendation is to seek stillness. Meditation is the greatest asset human beings have to being able to evolve and there are so many ways to effectively meditate -- look them up and find something that works for you. Carl Jung's works have helped me also. Find some spiritual teachers at your level and then continue to find more as your progress. 

u/ghoul_playsGrimm - I think it's easy to get caught up in the countless things we endure, thus forgetting the value in positive life choices, activities, hobbies, routines  etc.. We are more than just a ""Targeted Individual"" and it's imperative to our healing that we have something which brings us joy. Something we look forward to, take pride in, or just enjoy doing. I've found that being outside has been the most effective thing in combating a lot of the difficult  times. I've also gotten back into a lifelong hobby which I took a few years off of, creating music, and that had made a huge positive impact on me. 

u/rusty_shackleford431 - Exercise, eating well, meditation and deep introspection. Do these things and the noise will fade I promise. They can lose their power over you and its not as difficult as we think. For most it just takes time to master the way of not caring. Eventually you come out the other side more resilient than when it started. This is the way. 

u/Greedy_Strawberry210 - Believe nothing they say or do. Voice or physical wise. They only speak in lies, delusions and projections. You are more than your thoughts and body.

u/astralpariah - Yes, my voices used to rape me, every night and say the most insulting things at high velocity and volume. It was 24/7. Realizing the mind to be a communally conscious thing, that EVERY thought and action was taken in part by spirits that come and go, even what was said to the voices. This led me to realize I needed to focus on life, it was hell but I just ignored the harassment, it took work to stop my involuntary emotions and responses, but it time it was easier to ignore them than standing. There were still breakaway moments when my voices attempted to harm me in a large collective attack, I'm very lucky, it never had a lasting negative impact on me. There's more to it than what most people would take this advice to mean, but I got well ignoring them and meditating into a healthier mind. Yes the thing that steals your mind is there when you attempt this, yes it throws bigger tantrum when you attempt this. In time the storm is consumed by your self empowerment.

u/alcorne - As a TI, causing fear is your opponent's #1 strength. By understanding your fear, you can improve your defenses. Every time you experience fear, you're experiencing a road map to your weakness. That's where you're vulnerable. That's where they're going to attack you. Look at your fear openly, with honestly and bravery. Now that you can see it, research ways to beat that particular fear and implement strategies to overcome it. So be grateful for your fears. They are the indicators of your weakest parts, your vulnerable places. And instead of pushing them away, bravely appreciate the opportunity they give you and USE them to grow stronger.

Remember: ""What you resist, persists, and what you look at goes away.""

u/alpeterpeter - People framed as perps for you are never perps. Every. Single. Time. No matter how confident you are. No matter how much proof you think you have. You will realize it all was a cleverly constructed setup, false targets set up for you so you'd retaliate and make costly mistakes while thinking you are righteously defending yourself. Be extremely cautious about anything you do - 99% of harm in TI experience comes from your own hands when you are provoked or manipulated. TI's should try to use the ""perps"" as teachers, as training tools to help themselves become stronger. When you turn the tables like this, you can get away from negativity and see the experience as a challenge and opportunity.

u/MantisAwakening - Whatever they say, don’t let them manipulate you into fear or get you upset. If they predict something bad happening say something like “Wow, that’s intense. Seems unlit though. Tell you what, if that happens I owe you a dollar and if it doesn’t you owe me one.” If they’re just being relentlessly vicious respond with something like “I’m rubber you’re glue, bounces off me and sticks to you” or “I know you are but what am I?” In all cases it’s just about making it lighthearted and positive as much as possible. Take their power away. Try this for a while and see what happens. People have reported that they can get their voices to be supportive and not cruel if they stick with it.

u/ZealousidealGain5244 - 
The way that I got myself out of that was to look at the ways that the situations I was in were helping me. It didn’t feel like help at the time but it actually was. (This didn’t happen overnight for me) It was a way of fighting back…I felt like anything that happened to me was easier to face if I mentally turned it around as a good thing happening to me. They couldn’t win if I did that!!! I felt I was beating them at this game in just a tiny way. When I gained just that little bit of strength, everything changed. 
Overall, the negative things happened so I could have a different and better life. In the beginning, I couldn’t see that. It was hard to recognize. Sometimes I still can get upset about what people did to me but as time passes, it gets easier. I experienced loss of family, friends, homelessness, hope, despair, attempts at committing me to mental institutions, and much much more. I am out of that because of the change in my thought process. I no longer allow the people in my life that did not support me and I no longer let the negativity of the spirits control me. (This took years because I was alone). I hope this helps someone know that they are not alone. You can get out of this, there are others like us. Sending love your way. 

u/TheCuriousTarget - Ultimately, I believe this is the spiritual path we chose before we even incarnated. I believe it's our chosen path to finding our power. In a technical sense, everything reflected in the world around us is either a mirror of who we are, what we judge in others and what we lack, do to power we have given away. Based on my experience and what I've read about the experience of others on here, it seems like it is mostly a reflection of what we judge and what we lack. I believe we judge too harshly on honesty and fairness and we are quick to attribute motive to perps. Right now, you guys are going through the dark night of the soul but the darkest hour is just before dawn. I'm discovering new psychic and spiritual powers all the time. It is cool as heck!!!! I love it! I'm rooting for all of you to get here too. I know you will. All shift happily now. That's something you can repeat to yourself to hurry the process along and remind you to reserve judgement and call back your power. 
ALL SHIFT HAPPILY NOW!

u/Wise-Metal-3730 - I am reaching spiritual plateau's I wouldn't have never reached without it! When the experiences don't change the challenge is to change yourself that's how the universe gets us to grow into our purpose!

u/Southern-Solid3454 - It's kind of like this. They are what they are. Usually they aren't fun, they aren't likeable.  They tend to carry a sense of humor (albeit a mean one.)  They seem trapped in patterns of negativity and bring us into a negative space ourselves, using over criticism, insults or simply being misleading, or contradictory. This is why positivity becomes very important. What is said here is true. Whatever they are they aren't like us and really can't help being the way that they are. When I get mad at them, their needs to be some kind of understanding that I am being not much different from the rage quitting kid who gets mad at a game for losing, and then almost purposefully destroys his xbox controller. Many here find mantras and spiritual paths to be helpful, I like to joke with mine when possible, and yes, at those times it can actually become fun. I get mine to join in on making fun of the same person, or the same thing.

u/Disastrous_Forces_69 - Don't dwell on the past, and dont worry about the future, live in the present. This is just my experience. My big break came from the unseen showing me that it wasn't an individualised problem, that it could influence and talk through the ones around me, as well as manipulate the physical world at will. It was a big weight off my chest, I lost the mindset of ""there's something wrong with me."" Instead I realised it is all around us, and influencing everyone, not just the ones that are aware of its presence. This realization gave me motivation and dragged me out from the pit I buried myself in, all this time of people telling me there was something wrong with me. It really is life changing when you realize people are another expenditure of this force, and you really only can rely on yourself and the truth that you know. It's not something you'll be able to grasp unless you go through it, but this is what helped me. People's intervention is meaningless, them saying something nasty or nice is no different than the voices saying something nasty or nice, I'm completely changed. I have no ego, no attachments, no fear, no hatred, nothing but peace, flowing like a river. I don't let my interactions with the unseen distract or irritate me, it's a reminder and a sacrifice I have endured for this ultimate knowledge that has freed me. I'm working, I'm happy, I'm not medicated, I feel whole. Attachment leads to suffering.

u/11121357 - Love yourself. Know you are a pillar. The external attack is fear inducing. Get to a point that dissects the external, bring it in internally. Examine and discard what isn't useful to you. Love yourself.

u/balanced-bird - Their occupation with you is to make life harder, they will do anything to have that goal achieved. After all it is your voice that dominates the voices inside your head, not a voice from them. My best advice is find your North Star, or the thing that anchors your hope. Place all of your trust in that belief, and then your actions and decisions will follow. Reinforce that North Star every day with positive reaffirming actions every day and the energy in your body will flow naturally. Have faith, and trust it will all work out.

u/33biggelectric - Some describe it as a process in our evolution. Chemically all life processes are burning. So, all energetic activity among the elements of life is thought of as the work of Fire in ancient symbols. ""Passing through the fire."" The lower nature and elements are being burned up and aligned with what is more spiritual. That's going to cause some pain. Especially if you don't know what's happening and you are working against it and not with it so that you can ascend and not descend more. 

""Our God is a consuming fire"" - Bible

u/Nando9000 - They want you to feel tortured and alone and hostile towards the very people you care about. Its truly one of the most tortuous experiences one can endure. With this informed perspective though, should still be the desire to overcome and destroy the system that is doing this to you. Remember, its not your friends and family's fault that they are easily deceived. Remember the perpetrators are not them. They are just a proxy being manipulated into harming you. 

u/Sorry_End3401 - I used to react and overreact. Not anymore. I always wanted more of everything. Not anymore. I judged harshly of myself and everyone around me. That’s gone too. I am not concerned  with owning anything. There is a peace at not knowing or having to have the answers all the time. My emotional intelligence is increasing. I have learned to live with little. I could be dropped in a field with nothing and feel ok. I don’t have to be entertained 24/7. If I have a cup of coffee I am thrilled beyond belief. I enjoy such small things now. I just accept the buzzing instead of fighting it. I've learned much from losing everything including myself.

u/tyre332 - Ones focus should always be on overcoming the obstacle rather than on the obstacle itself. It took me a while to realize this but when I finally had that shift in perspective, it lead to some fundamental changes in my ability to deal with what is happening to me.

u/Senior_Run5472 - We have essentially self-corrected by seeing the mistakes we've made by eliminating our old responses. We realize how we used to respond encouraged what attacked us. We became our worst enemy under the circumstances without knowing it, but once we became conscious of our role and how it was defeating us, we changed how we interacted, which is really just identifying how we enabled our own downfall. I identify completely with what you've said here. I no longer provide the fuel for my destruction. I am not culpable. I am elevated. We have reached a type of self preservation through observation instead of reaction.

u/EDH70 - Shadow work is like unpacking a suitcase and examining each piece of clothing to determine if it’s valuable enough to keep or if it needs to be thrown away. This experience has made me evaluate every decision I’ve ever made, every word I’ve ever said and most importantly, every mistake I’ve ever made. “Unpacking” has helped me heal wounds, address my faults and become accountable for my life…. My decisions. It has allowed me to become the person I wanted to be. When our hearts are filled with love there is no room for hate and fear.

This is WAY TMI. I’ve been TTC for 12 months I’m on progesterone support from my fertility specialist that I take like clockwork after ovulation is confirmed through BBT so I start on DPO 3 evening once confirmed through morning BBT. 

Everything happens like clockwork, symptoms every month since starting progesterone 4 months ago and prior to the progesterone have always been the same. Down to the DPO that my boobs get sore. Absolute clock work. 

No weird and wonderful new symptoms EVER.

HOWEVER. Last night at 2 am I woke up with pain in my literal butthole like up in my rectum. And I thought oh no, I need to go to the toilet. Sat for 30 minutes thinking this was going to be the biggest load of my life. Nothing, zip, nada. I don’t feel constipated, I don’t feel diharrea, NOTHING. The pain goes away, I toddle back to bed, I wake up do my BBT slightly higher (as expected on progesterone). I think back to the RANDOM butt hole / rectum nerve pain. I have my coffee and do my morning business as per usual, NOTHING different, no change in colour, no pain, nothing. 

Fast forward 4 hours, random little twinges which feel cervical (not too unusual) but random zaps again IN MY RECTUM. 

Now chat GPT obviously gaslights me and says this is so exciting because it’s a new symptom, but I’ve been around this track before, I’m not having it, so what do I do? I come to reddit to see if ANYONE has ever had random butthole pain, because if I can’t tell strangers on the internet or the robotic brain of chat gpt, who can I tell. 

If you read this far, thank you, you’re the real MVP.

The thing is, she’s the rudest and dirtiest person I’ve ever known. When we lived together, she not only expected me to pay for everything, left breadcrumbs and coffee stains everywhere and criticised everything about me (my taste in music, my sense of humor) but she was also SO unhygienic. She didn’t even help keeping the apartment clean. She let her stinky shoes in the middle of the livingroom everyday, and her bedroom stank so much that it impacted the smell of the entire house. I have asthma and I’m very allergic to dust, therefore the house should always be clean and ventilated. She knew that, but she would still get mad at me if I opened her stinky bedroom’s window.

She also started being really rude. I would always make sure that dinner was ready before she got home, so she wouldn’t worry about cooking. It was just something I did everyday because I cared about her, but when she got home, she would always say something like “let me sit. What’s for dinner? You did leave some for me, right?” Then she would sit next to me with the ENTIRE PAN and chew really loudly with her mouth open.

Every time I tried confronting her she would isolate herself or throw a tantrum. For example, at my partner’s birthday. I promised him that I would make a huge birthday cake for him, and he was very excited about that. I spent 6 hours on the cake. When she came home from work, the birthday cake was ready and my partner told her she could eat some if she wanted to. The next morning, we found out the huge birthday cake was almost entirely gone, with only a piece left. I confronted her, but she was very defensive and said that I acted as if she did it on purpose (excuse me? Is there such a thing as eating an entire cake on accident?). She also told me she didn’t feel like birthday cakes were that big of a deal, and that I was exaggerating.

She eventually decided it was time for her to live alone, and I felt SO relieved. I have I really good place with my partner now. But probably realising she pushed away everyone in her life, she invited herself to spend Christmas Eve in my new home. I made up a sad story about how broke we are, and that we wouldn’t be able to celebrate Christmas, and so eventually she dropped the idea. I know she would only criticise everything and eat all of our food, chewing really loudly and putting her smelly foot on the table. I don’t want her in my life anymore but feel really guilty because she’s clueless about that, and besides, she’s all alone. AITA for lying to her? ",29,1765496983.0,AmItheAsshole,37,0.91,False

I need serious urgent help ! Long post,"Okay so I've read like every post on here and I need some clarity on my own situation for my own mental clarity I Am a 29f and my partner was a 27m . I am diagnosed with ptsd and anxiety after surviving a severely physically abusive relationship a few years ago were I almost died . I am also an empath who loves to take care of people . I don't shout or swear and hate arguments . Me and my partner have been together since last August . We met at a festival and he was living with a friend at the time after being released from prison after a 4 year sentence for non violent ​ offences . Because of wht I've been through in the past I was very upfront with him about my history of dv and he assured me he was understanding soon long story short this year and a half has been hell . He moved in after the first night and smokes 3g of cannabis daily when we met he had tons of promises to get it together when he was off probation so I wanted to help him and I am such a caring person I did everything for him . He has no phone no car no bank card so I let him use my bank to get uc . I let him use my car . He started getting weird when after literally a week he wanted to know everything about my past and people I was with previously I was open about it as we live in a small area and he knew one or two of the people but it was years ago and nothing serious. He starts constantly going on about this accusing me of being a liar and sleeping with people I hadn't . He spent everyday with me for like a month and then starteddemanding I took him to his friends house a 30 might drive away and pick him up usually super late at like 11pm at night even though I was exhausted and had been working all day if I refused he would threaten to move back to his friends and say I was a hater and stopping him from seeing his f friends . He had no money and when he had no cannabis he would just sit there silently ignoring me watching YouTube shorts making me super uncomfortable so I offered to buy it for him . This turned into a everyday thing now most of my money was going on cannabis from work and I had 0 . again not a lot but I quickly realised everytime he didn't have it he would take it out on me. Around Christmas he was like we should get a ps5 then it started we had a nice Xmas and I had hope but then he got ""sick"" he refuses to help me decorate the house or put up furniture or clean or basically do anything he said he was sick and just layed in bed on ps5 for hours playing with girls as well as boys and when I would try and speak to him he would pull a face and ignore me I did everything and always have cook clean drive etc . during this time I felt sick myself and out it down to stress . I was pregnant and he didn't give a shit he told me he wasn't ready so I ended up having an abortion that left me with an infection for months he would still expect me to drive him everywhere despite me really being sick and offered no care or sympathy for me . when we had no money for petrol he would fly into a rage and throw things smash stuff and say I was stopping him seeing friends and blame me for everything I was sleeping on the floor as he would elbow me purposely in the night and call me names of I woke him up . Around this time in March after looking after him for months the fits had got worse he walked out on day of my abortion. And would threaten to leave constantly . Then I found him cheating with someone on discord on my own phone he called me a slag didn't apologise and said I'm not even with you after me looking after him for months !!! he blames me I was so shocked I threatened a break and he did apologise but that's when he started calling me a ducking slag almost daily .. Okay that's just March March until now will be continued just reading this is so ducked up here's a list since but omg I broke up with him by text 3 says ago to his friends phone as he doesn't have one and I don't know why I miss him so much i keep blaming myself please help ..

Okay so then I went on a holiday in March with my mum and my sister and while I was gone he was acting like a needy child saying he was hungry etc I was ready to end things then but then I got a large sum of money and he started saying i wanted it all to myself that was why I didn't want to be with him etc so I spent most of it just in us and living I didn't get anything for myself then I got a puppy who he did love but didnt help with at all . He is still gaming constantly and refuses to let me speak he has a microphone on constantly and I can't use my living room if I speak he pulls a face at me or says the microphone is on I can't even say his name .the past few months have been exhausted he got off probation but continued the same shit . Instead of getting a job he put himself down as my carer .even though I am killing myself doing everything alone and he didn't help with anything her was still calling me daily names . After he broke my car and then left me at the side of the road I left him but then begged for him back because he said it's all my fault I just chat shit and all he does is innocently sit on the ps5 it's all me I lied to him I went on holiday etc . After that I keep breaking up then going back it's never him apologising or reaching out I've cried so so many times i feel so so stuck I feel like I !miss him now but I know it needs to be final he says he loves !e but doesn't show it I keep thinking is me because these last few weeks he has money he has finally left and not reached out or bothered me when in the past he would never leAve I feel he's just going to meet someone else who isn't ducked up like me n be good to her ​​​​​​​​​

This is WAY TMI. I’ve been TTC for 12 months I’m on progesterone support from my fertility specialist that I take like clockwork after ovulation is confirmed through BBT so I start on DPO 3 evening once confirmed through morning BBT. 

Everything happens like clockwork, symptoms every month since starting progesterone 4 months ago and prior to the progesterone have always been the same. Down to the DPO that my boobs get sore. Absolute clock work. 

No weird and wonderful new symptoms EVER.

HOWEVER. Last night at 2 am I woke up with pain in my literal butthole like up in my rectum. And I thought oh no, I need to go to the toilet. Sat for 30 minutes thinking this was going to be the biggest load of my life. Nothing, zip, nada. I don’t feel constipated, I don’t feel diharrea, NOTHING. The pain goes away, I toddle back to bed, I wake up do my BBT slightly higher (as expected on progesterone). I think back to the RANDOM butt hole / rectum nerve pain. I have my coffee and do my morning business as per usual, NOTHING different, no change in colour, no pain, nothing. 

Fast forward 4 hours, random little twinges which feel cervical (not too unusual) but random zaps again IN MY RECTUM. 

Now chat GPT obviously gaslights me and says this is so exciting because it’s a new symptom, but I’ve been around this track before, I’m not having it, so what do I do? I come to reddit to see if ANYONE has ever had random butthole pain, because if I can’t tell strangers on the internet or the robotic brain of chat gpt, who can I tell. 

If you read this far, thank you, you’re the real MVP. 

7 DPO not testing until 10 DPO because let’s all stop spending our money on first response just to hurt our feelings.

I answered her plea and helped her out. The next year, she had welcomed a second child, had to quit her job to care for her sick mother, and had apparently sold a car so she and her husband could make ends meet. I helped again. After the second Christmas, she sent me a thank you and a friend request, and I accepted. Her profile was full of TikTok posts that detailed her life as a novice influencer. So many videos of her doing designer shopping hauls, displaying expensive nails, and trying out expensive coffee shops and such. So basically, she was struggling because of this. I posted something on Reddit before about this and people advised me how to proceed.

Two weeks ago, she reached out to me again and asked if I could once more help her buy Christmas gifts for her two kids. I didn't answer right away, but I didn't want to ghost her or anything, so I responded and told her, as advised, that I wouldn't be helping her this year. I told her politely that ""it is clear to me that your inability to afford Christmas gifts for your girls stems from irresponsible financial decisions, not being down on your luck like you've claimed"". I apologized and advised her to go shopping at some of the cheaper places I do my shopping at, like Ross, Marshalls, and Burlington. She blew up at me for being so insulting. She called me an AH for shaming her when she's trying to make a living for her kids by becoming an influencer. She shamed me on the local Facebook group where she originally reached out for help two years ago, posting my name and a snapshot of my Facebook profile on there.

That's why I started experimenting with the **micro-habit** method, and it truly changed everything. My main challenge became remembering to do the tiny things consistently.

# 💡 What I Did Differently

1. **Tiny Steps Only:** Everything became 5 minutes or less (e.g., ""10 push-ups,"" ""write 3 sentences,"" ""drink a glass of water"").
2. **The Anchor Habit:** I tied new habits to old ones (e.g., *After I pour my coffee, I open the habit app*).
3. **Built an App for It:** Since existing trackers felt too complex, I spent the last few months developing [stopTimetrxy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stoptimetryx.app) specifically to handle this simple, consistent routine building.

# 🚀 What My App Does (And Why I Think You'll Like It)

* **Routine Flow Builder:** Instead of just a daily list, you build a *sequence* of micro-habits that flow logically through your morning, work, or evening.
* **Zero-Friction Completion:** Designed for one-tap completion. The goal is to spend less than 30 seconds *in* the app per session.
* **Simple Stats:** Tracks your **consistency streak** without overwhelming you with complex charts.
* **Free:** This app is free and you can set up to 2 routines as you wish

1pkcpn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pkcpn2/aita_for_feeling_like_my_best_friends_new/,AITA for feeling like my best friend’s new girlfriend is overstepping my boundaries?,"I swear I’m losing perspective here, so it’s gonna be a long one

I’m 28F, my best friend Luna (29F) has been dating her girlfriend Riley (27F) for about 9 months now. It’s Luna’s first relationship with a woman and things escalated fast — the classic WLW “move in together in two weeks” speedrun. They’re extremely loving and intense, and honestly? I’m genuinely happy she found someone that values her so much. I don’t think Riley is toxic. I don’t think she’s a bad person. Their relationship is beautiful and healthy from what I can see.

But… I feel like I’m drowning in it.

Important context: I’m autistic, so new people take me time, space, and zero pressure. I need to get comfortable at my own pace. But pretty much since day one, I’ve felt this expectation that I MUST instantly get along with Riley because I’m Luna’s best friend, and “if Luna’s happy, I should be happy,” and “we should all be super close.” And that pressure alone already put me on edge.

At the start, Luna would involve me in everything about Riley — telling me constant updates about her life even when it was completely unrelated to our conversations. When we hung out, she’d be on video call with Riley half the time, so Riley even saw me in my pajamas and just woken up when I hadn’t even met her. I gently told Luna I was happy for her and really liked seeing her happy, but I needed our one-on-one friend time to still exist.

And she understood… for about two weeks. And then back to the exact same patterns.

We game online together, and even there, Riley was always physically in the background. Every time I called Luna to talk about something private or personal, Riley was just there. Hovering. Listening. Not actively participating, but present. And I don’t know her well enough to be comfortable with that. I’m always polite and try to mold myself to Riley’s energy so she doesn’t think I don’t like her, but honestly it’s exhausting.

Then Luna started integrating Riley into our whole friend group, which we’ve never done with anyone’s partner. None of us said anything, but all of us felt it.

I talked to Luna again. She understood… for another few weeks. Then same thing again.

Nine months later… nothing has changed

I waited because I kept thinking, “Okay, honeymoon phase eventually ends.”

Except… it hasn’t. At all.

And now it’s gotten to the point where Riley is EVERYWHERE in my life, even indirectly, some examples:

    •	On my birthday, Luna posted a photo of us and Riley left a super long, emotional comment like we were lifelong besties.
    
    •	I hosted a tiny birthday gathering with only my closest friends. Riley didn’t come (because I didn’t invite her honestly) but still sent the biggest gift and a card saying “thank you for letting me be part of your friend group.” Huh?
    
    •	During my party, Luna was texting Riley nonstop, even though they literally live together.
    
    •	Now I feel awkwardly obligated to give Riley a birthday gift even though I barely know her (I know I’m not, but I also know if I don’t I’ll look like a bad person) 
    
    •	Every time Luna and I play games online, Riley is RIGHT THERE, bringing snacks, talking to Luna, inserting herself indirectly into every moment.
    
    •	Luna and I had plans one day (we see each other every two weeks) and minutes before, she told me Riley would join for “just 30 minutes because she was nearby.” She was not “nearby.” And they were glued to each other the whole time.
    
    •	Another day, we were grabbing coffee and Riley “accidentally showed up” at the end, and then I found out she came on purpose.

Every time Luna shows me something on her phone, Riley’s face is in the background. Notifications, photos, messages. Which I get obviously, they’re a happy couple, but I cannot escape this girl.

I know these are small things and details and that I’m making it so much bigger than it is but I’m really trying to ignore this but it isn’t working. Like I know if they were bigger issues Luna would notice (or at least I’d hope) but since they’re so small I feel like I’m the only one noticing them and I’m thinking I’m crazy.

And here’s the part that’s messing with my head:

I don’t think Riley is doing this to be controlling or toxic. I actually think it’s because Luna has been handling this whole dynamic poorly. Luna is normally extremely emotionally aware, communicates well, goes to therapy, and we’ve always had a solid friendship. But with this relationship… it feels like she loses herself a bit and completely forgets boundaries.

So my rational brain knows Riley isn’t the problem.

But emotionally? I’m at the point where even hearing Riley’s name irritates me irrationally. I feel invaded, overloaded, and honestly exhausted.

And the cherry on top: Luna and I text everyday, and she mentions Riley in EVERY single text. Even when it’s completely irrelevant. For example instead of saying “Hey, do you want to play something later?” she’ll say “Hey, Riley is going to go and take the trash out so do you want to play?”

And I’m sitting there like… why is this information necessary? It’s like trying to unsubscribe from a newsletter and it just keeps emailing you.

So… AITA?

For feeling overwhelmed and frustrated, even though I genuinely like Riley, I’m happy for Luna, and I know the real issue is how Luna is managing things? I want to know some outsider opinions before I talk to Luna (for the third time)

Spent about 11 years with some form of nicotine (dip, snuss, then nic pouches). I started on Zyn/Rogue about 3-4 years ago as a replacement to dipping tobacco. At first, it was fine. My teeth weren't near as stained, my mouth didn't get tore up quite as bad, and I felt like I was heading in the right direction.

Fast forward to this year, it started causing some issues I'm sure some of ya'll are familiar with. I started having frequent palpitations, a few rare occasions I had 3-5 second runs of SVT, elevated blood pressure and heart rate when using them, overall fatigue and lethargy, poor sleep, and no motivation. What really made me quit was getting these weird sensations in my chest. Not a burning, aching, or deep pain but more like a quick ""pinching"" in my chest that went away immediately after. I started noticing it only happened when I would put a pouch in (along with the other symptoms, but addiction will make you ignore some pretty alarming stuff). Working in the medical field for about 9 years now, I got scared, as I knew where I was heading if I didn't quit.

At the 3 and a half week mark, I feel 100x better. I have loads more energy and motivation to do things, my blood pressure and heart rate are down considerably, maybe 1-2 palpitations a week now (could just be from caffeine, as I do enjoy a few cups of strong black coffee through the day), no SVT noted, and my wallet isn't taking a massive hit like it used to lol! First week is the hardest. Irritation, insomnia, intense cravings, lack of energy, even a bit of depression. One thing I found that helps me is sugar-free Extra chewing gum.

Could probably bite through a hardwood table by now😂 Needless to say, I don't go through as much now. The cravings have gone down quite with occasional flare ups (chew gum).

I opened the door, and stepped in carelessly. I should not have done that.



 I fell into the room I had found labelled *Armory*, and I was hit in the legs by a flying helmet. It knocked me over, but I was pretty quick to keep moving. It spun me sideways, and then a body followed it, flung by some unseen force. He hit the ground in front of me, bones bending with a sick sort of bounce. It seemed unnatural the way he moved; I didn't have much time to ponder it, though.



 My boots kicked and scrabbled for purchase but the ground just let go. It felt more like rejection than falling. One second I was standing, the next I was tumbling in a weightless void. I wrenched my spine to look for Rex.



""Are we falling?"" I shouted over to him, and Mr. Unlucky. I didn't have time to come up with a different nickname.



A frantic barking filled the air. 



“Rex!” 



 In the chaos, he was flailing around, snapping at floating debris. His barks were distorted in the strange echoes of our weightless bubble. They grew more desperate, adding to the cacophony of our panic.



 I saw an opportunity, reached out and grabbed the passing soldier by his backpack. He was unconscious. Great, dead weight. I drug his limp form closer to me and kicked off the wall, propelling us toward the entrance.



 Rex had been clawing at the door, his instincts telling him that was the way out. I needed to get to him. I didn't know what I'd do once I got to him, but I knew my dog needed me. I flung Mr. Unlucky forward, not realizing I'd fly back just as fast. He collided limply with Rex in the doorway, Rex used it to make his way back into the range, and all 4 of his paws stayed steadfast on the ground. 



 He was as confused as I was, but the wall behind me grabbed my attention away when I hit it. I hadn’t thought to tuck my head, so it bounced off of the concrete with a nice hollow thump that left my head swimming.



 Mr. unlucky was making his way back around,  true to form, he wasn't lucky enough to make it through. He came propelled by an unseen current that kept the whole room in motion. We were still stuck bouncing around like a couple of DVD logos. I was being pelted with coffee mugs, shell casings and paperwork. In all the chaos, I lost track of ragdoll man until I collided with him again. His knee hit my ribs. I took advantage, and wrapped my arms around his backpack, and latched on, leaving a bracing pain radiating from my ribs.



 That hurts. I'm getting too old for this crap.



 The pain got me as grounded as I could be without any ground. My high school physics class kicked in, and I remembered Newton's laws. High school was a while ago; but equal and opposite reactions and such came back to me. I knew it meant I needed to throw stuff to move. 



 So throw stuff, I did. I freed a hand and started catching the things that had been pelting me in the face. My athletic abilities left something to be desired, but eventually, I had gained a limited control of my motion. 



 At first it didn’t seem to be working. Throwing wastebaskets and staplers to try to gain momentum takes awhile, but I got to a desk, and we were cooking with gas. I saw Rex’s tail wagging as he hopped up excitedly cheering me on, a lighthouse in the trash storm. I’d have told him to stay, but he already got the idea. He wasn’t gonna come back in here for all the treats in Colorado. 



  My momentum carried me and my unwilling passenger to the door, and I latched on to the handle with my free hand. Thank God for the ADA, because if it had been a knob I’d have missed it. I shoved Mr. Unlucky through the door, and as soon as he made contact with the ground the room turned sideways.



 The room teased. I swear I heard “I can’t let you do that, Dave.” Amused malice filled the air, as I fell away from my dog. I could see him running back and forth in front of the door, but the barking didn’t make it to my ears. I fell in slow motion. I should clarify that it’s that type of slow motion that you get when you fall down the stairs, not an actual supernatural force like whatever I was swimming in. 



 I fell into the cinderblock, bouncing my head again before being buried in debris. Nothing felt broken, but to be honest, nothing felt like much of anything. The second whack on the head had filled my body with jelly in an instant. The last thing I remember was consciousness slipping away from me, as an insult of dirt and pebbles rained across my face.  



 God knows how long I laid there. I woke up to pain. My joints were all unionizing, demanding better working conditions behind the leadership of my skull. I began negotiating, bargaining that I’d get a massage and take some vitamins if they would just let me crawl. 



 The union and I came to the tentative terms of me not doing that crap ever again, and I slowly pushed myself up to a kneeling position. I placed my hand on a chair beside me, surprised to feel it upright. I blinked awake to hear an ear splitting barking coming from the doorway I had fallen from. I scanned across the pristine room to look at Rex who had jumped up from laying down when he saw me get up.



 The rascal had waited for me, but he wasn’t coming into this room. I looked around it, and was stunned to realize I didn’t see why. The desks and chairs all sat neatly in a line, with monitors atop them, ready for someone to log in and just start a shift. The ammo counter sat with neatly arranged firearms behind it, shell casings in buckets, paperwork still neatly in wall folders, nowhere near my face. 



  I wrenched my way upright, and stood for a minute to let all my blood catch up. I shambled over, finally made it, only to collapse again in the doorframe where I received a thousand dog kisses. I thought we had trained that out of him, but I was happy to be wrong. I sat down on the ground there and let him go at my face. I was curious how long he’d go, but he outlasted me.



 ""Stop. Stop it pup.” I put my hand on his head, pushed it away and started in with the scritches. “What was that?"" I asked, getting off the floor.



I stood to close the door, but remembering the chaos that unfolded in that room made me hesitate. Absolutely everything was back in place. There was no evidence of what just happened to me. I stood staring dumb, trying to reconcile reality with the pristine room in front of me. The corner full of stuff I threw was empty save for a ficus. Even the dirt in the pot sat undisturbed.



 I looked myself over, and found scrapes, bruises, and even some pebbles in my coverall pockets. My soldier friend was in just as bad a shape. His cheek was swollen, and he was clearly still out. 



 I couldn't get the reality I was in to line up with the one I just escaped. We had clearly been through something, but all I had to prove it was some dirt and the soldier lying unconscious by nurse Rex. I looked back into the room one last time. I shook my head, and decided I couldn't dwell on it. 



 It was best to just close the door on it.

ACT ONE

INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jerry is eating cereal. Kramer slides in, carrying a thick book.

KRAMER: Jerry! Jerry, you're not gonna believe what just happened to me.

JERRY: Let me guess - you invented a new way to organize your socks?

KRAMER: No, no, no. Two very clean-cut young men knocked on my door. Suits, ties, name tags. The whole nine yards.

JERRY: Jehovah's Witnesses?

KRAMER: Mormons, Jerry! Missionaries! And they gave me this. [holds up Book of Mormon] I read the whole thing in two days.

JERRY: The whole thing? Kramer, you've never finished a menu.

KRAMER: It's riveting! You got Nephi, Lehi, the Lamanites, the Jaredites - Jerry, they came to America on boats! Ancient boats!

JERRY: Boats?

KRAMER: Submarines, practically! Barges! And get this - there's this guy Moroni, he buries golden plates in upstate New York. Upstate New York, Jerry!

JERRY: Wait, you actually understood it?

KRAMER: Cover to cover! I can quote you Second Nephi right now. ""For it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy faith...""

JERRY: Okay, okay, I believe you.

KRAMER: They're coming back Thursday to discuss my questions. I've got so many questions. Like, what happened to the Mulekites? The book just kind of glosses over the Mulekites!

Elaine enters.

ELAINE: Who's coming back Thursday?

KRAMER: Mormon missionaries! You'd love 'em, Elaine. Very polite, well-groomed...

ELAINE: (interested) How well-groomed?

KRAMER: Like they iron their faces.

ELAINE: Are they cute?

JERRY: Elaine, they're missionaries.

ELAINE: So? Missionaries can't be attractive?

JERRY: They're trying to save souls, not date.

ELAINE: Well maybe my soul needs saving. What time Thursday?

INT. MONK'S CAFÉ - DAY

Jerry, George, and Elaine in booth.

GEORGE: Mormons? The Osmond people?

JERRY: Kramer's become a Book of Mormon scholar.

GEORGE: (scoffing) Please. The Mormons? With their perfect families and their caffeine-free lifestyles? It's a cult, Jerry. A cult!

ELAINE: How is it a cult?

GEORGE: They don't drink coffee! What kind of religion forbids coffee? That's not faith, that's tyranny!

JERRY: You don't even drink coffee.

GEORGE: That's not the point! The point is I could if I wanted to. Freedom, Jerry! These people have no freedom!

ELAINE: I think they seem nice.

GEORGE: Nice? They're confused, young, and naive! Going door to door, trying to recruit people... it's like a pyramid scheme with hymns.

JERRY: Strong words from a man who sold computers for Kramerica Industries.

GEORGE: That was different. That was entrepreneurship.

ELAINE: Well I'm meeting them Thursday. One of them - Elder Anderson - Jerry, he looked like he was carved from soap. Just... smooth. Respectful. Probably calls his mother.

GEORGE: You're falling for their trap, Elaine. That's what they do - they send in the good-looking ones to lure you in. Classic cult tactics.

JERRY: George, you joined a gym because the sales girl smiled at you.

GEORGE: She was very persuasive.

ACT TWO

INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - THURSDAY

Kramer, Jerry, Elaine. Knock on door. Two young missionaries enter - ELDER ANDERSON (handsome, 22) and ELDER PETERSON (eager, 20).

ELDER ANDERSON: Hi! We're so glad to be back. This is Elder Peterson, he just got here from Provo.

ELDER PETERSON: (shaking hands vigorously) Such a blessing to meet you all!

ELAINE: (to Elder Anderson) Hi. Again. I'm Elaine.

ELDER ANDERSON: Nice to meet you, Sister Benes.

ELAINE: (giggling) Sister Benes. I like that.

KRAMER: Elders! I finished the book. Cover to cover. And I gotta say, you guys really glossed over the Mulekites.

ELDER PETERSON: (surprised) You... you read about the Mulekites?

KRAMER: Of course! Descendants of Mulek, son of King Zedekiah. They merged with the Nephites around 200 BC. But here's my question - what language were they speaking? Hebrew? Reformed Egyptian?

ELDER ANDERSON: (impressed) Wow. Most people don't even make it past First Nephi.

KRAMER: First Nephi? That's just the setup! Wait till you get to Alma! Now that's where things get interesting. The Amlicites? The Anti-Nephi-Lehies? Jerry, these people buried their weapons as a covenant with God!

JERRY: Buried their weapons?

KRAMER: They made a promise never to fight again! And then when they were attacked, they just... let it happen. That's commitment, Jerry.

ELDER PETERSON: Brother Kramer, you have a remarkable understanding of the scriptures.

KRAMER: Oh, I'm just getting started. What about the brother of Jared? The guy sees the finger of God! Just the finger! How big was this finger?

George enters abruptly, stops when he sees the missionaries.

GEORGE: Oh. You're still doing the... Mormon thing.

JERRY: George, this is Elder Anderson and Elder Peterson.

GEORGE: Right. The cult representatives.

ELDER ANDERSON: (politely) We prefer ""missionaries.""

GEORGE: Missionaries, cult recruiters, same difference.

ELAINE: George!

GEORGE: What? I'm just saying what everyone's thinking. No offense, but you guys worship a guy who found golden plates in a hill. Golden plates, Jerry! How convenient that nobody else can see them!

KRAMER: Actually, George, eleven witnesses testified they saw the plates. Their testimonies are right here in the front of the book.

GEORGE: Eleven people in on it. That's how cults work!

ELDER PETERSON: Sir, I respect your skepticism, but perhaps if you learned more about our faith—

GEORGE: No thank you! I like my coffee, I like my freedom, and I like religions that were founded before the Industrial Revolution!

Knock on door. Jerry opens it. Two young SISTER MISSIONARIES enter - SISTER MARTINEZ (attractive, 23) and SISTER CHEN (also attractive, 24).

SISTER MARTINEZ: Hi! We're sorry to interrupt. We were told Elder Anderson and Elder Peterson were here?

ELDER ANDERSON: Sisters! Come in. We're just having a discussion about the Church.

SISTER CHEN: Wonderful! We love discussions.

George's jaw drops. He stares.

GEORGE: (completely different tone) Women? There are women missionaries?

SISTER MARTINEZ: Of course! About 30% of missionaries are sisters.

GEORGE: (suddenly interested) Well. Well, well, well. Perhaps I was too hasty in my... judgment. You know what? I'd love to learn more about this... faith. Very welcoming faith. Tell me everything.

JERRY: (to audience) And there it is.

INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - LATER

George is sitting very close to Sister Martinez and Sister Chen. Kramer is in deep theological discussion with Elder Peterson.

GEORGE: So you're from where? California?

SISTER MARTINEZ: San Diego.

GEORGE: San Diego! Beautiful city. I'm actually an architect. I design buildings. Important buildings.

JERRY: George...

GEORGE: What? I'm making conversation!

SISTER CHEN: An architect? That's impressive. What have you designed?

GEORGE: Oh, you know... various structures. I'm working on a chapel, actually. A Mormon chapel.

KRAMER: (from across the room) George, you're not an architect!

GEORGE: (hissing) Not now, Kramer!

SISTER MARTINEZ: You're designing a chapel? For the Church?

GEORGE: Well, it's in the early stages. Very early. Concept phase. But yes, I'm very interested in Mormon... architecture. Tell me, what features do you think make a good chapel? Spiritually speaking?

SISTER CHEN: Well, there's always a baptismal font...

GEORGE: Fonts! Yes! I'm big on fonts. Baptismal fonts, especially. Very important for the... submersion.

ELAINE: (to Elder Anderson) So do you guys ever hang out? Like, off duty?

ELDER ANDERSON: We have preparation day on Mondays. We do laundry, write letters home...

ELAINE: That sounds... fun?

KRAMER: (to Elder Peterson) But here's what I don't understand about the war chapters in Alma. Captain Moroni builds all these fortifications, right? Towers, walls, the whole thing. But then later, the Lamanites just... dig under them. Why didn't Moroni think of that?

ELDER PETERSON: (excited) That's actually a great question! The text suggests—

JERRY: Kramer's like a Book of Mormon professor over here.

GEORGE: (to Sister Martinez) You know what? Why don't we continue this conversation over dinner? I could show you some of my... architectural sketches.

SISTER MARTINEZ: Oh, we can't really do that. We have companionship rules.

GEORGE: Companionship! Perfect! All four of us. You, me, Sister Chen, and... (looks around) ...Jerry!

JERRY: What? No!

GEORGE: Jerry's very interested in Mormonism. Tell them, Jerry.

JERRY: I'm really not.

GEORGE: He's being modest. Saturday night? There's a great little Italian place...

SISTER CHEN: We don't really go on... dates.

GEORGE: It's not a date! It's a... spiritual consultation. About chapels. I need your input on the chapel.

INT. MONK'S CAFÉ - NEXT DAY

Jerry and George in booth.

JERRY: An architect? Really? You're doing the architect thing again?

GEORGE: It worked with Betsy! It'll work with Sister Martinez!

JERRY: She's a missionary, George!

GEORGE: So? She's also gorgeous! Did you see those eyes? That smile? And she's religious - my mother would love her!

JERRY: Your mother would love anyone who's not you.

GEORGE: I'm telling you, Jerry, this is fate. I've been against the Mormons this whole time, and now the universe is rewarding me with two beautiful sister missionaries. Two, Jerry! It's like they're daring me to choose!

JERRY: You can't date a missionary.

GEORGE: Why not? They're only missionaries for like two years. After that, they're fair game!

JERRY: So your plan is to wait two years?

GEORGE: No! My plan is to impress them now, stay in touch, and then when they're done with the mission, boom! George Costanza, architect and spiritual confidant, swoops in!

JERRY: This is your worst plan yet.

GEORGE: It's brilliant. I just need to maintain the architect thing for a few more weeks. How hard can it be?

Elaine enters and sits down.

ELAINE: Elder Anderson turned me down.

JERRY: For what?

ELAINE: I invited him to a museum. He said it would be ""inappropriate."" A museum, Jerry! How is art inappropriate?

GEORGE: That's what I'm saying! These people have too many rules! Except for Sister Martinez and Sister Chen. They have exactly the right amount of rules.

ELAINE: Wait, there are sister missionaries?

GEORGE: Oh yeah. And they're very interested in my architectural expertise.

JERRY: He's lying to them.

GEORGE: I'm networking. It's different.

ACT THREE

INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - SATURDAY NIGHT

George, Jerry, Sister Martinez, and Sister Chen at a table. George has spread out papers with crude drawings.

GEORGE: So as you can see from these sketches, I'm envisioning a very open floor plan. Light, airy... spiritually uplifting.

SISTER MARTINEZ: These are very... basic drawings.

GEORGE: Conceptual! The details come later. The important thing is the vision. Tell me, Sister Martinez, when you're in a chapel, what makes you feel closest to God?

SISTER CHEN: The Spirit, mostly.

GEORGE: The Spirit! Yes! I'll incorporate that into the design. Jerry, write that down. ""Incorporate Spirit.""

JERRY: I'm not writing anything down.

SISTER MARTINEZ: Mr. Costanza, can I ask you something?

GEORGE: George, please. Mr. Costanza is my father.

SISTER MARTINEZ: George, have you ever actually designed a building?

GEORGE: (pause) Define ""designed.""

SISTER CHEN: We called the Church headquarters. They said there's no George Costanza working on any chapel designs.

JERRY: (to audience) Here we go.

GEORGE: What? They must have the wrong records! I'm working with the... regional office. Different database.

SISTER MARTINEZ: There is no regional office database.

GEORGE: (sweating) Okay, you got me. I'm not designing a chapel yet. But I want to! I'm very passionate about Mormon architecture! The angles, the steeples...

SISTER CHEN: Are you even an architect?

GEORGE: I... studied architecture. Very briefly. I took a class. Well, I audited a class. I walked past a building once!

SISTER MARTINEZ: (standing up) We should go.

GEORGE: No, wait! I may have exaggerated about the architect thing, but my interest in you—I mean, in the Church—is very real!

SISTER CHEN: We're not interested in dating, Mr. Costanza.

GEORGE: Who said anything about dating? This is about faith! Community! I want to be part of something bigger!

SISTER MARTINEZ: By lying?

GEORGE: It's not lying, it's... aspirational truth!

The sisters leave. George puts his head in his hands.

JERRY: Aspirational truth?

GEORGE: I panicked!

INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - NEXT DAY

All four in the apartment. Kramer is wearing white, preparing for baptism.

JERRY: So let me get this straight. Kramer's getting baptized, Elaine got rejected by a 22-year-old missionary, and George got exposed as a fake architect. Again.

ELAINE: It wasn't a rejection! He said I was ""very nice"" but he couldn't ""jeopardize his mission.""

JERRY: That's literally a rejection.

GEORGE: And for the record, I could be an architect. I have the vision. I just lack the... training, credentials, and ability.

KRAMER: Well, I think it's all wonderful. I've found something bigger than myself. Elder Peterson says I have a better understanding of the Book of Mormon than most members.

JERRY: That's because you read it in two days like a maniac.

KRAMER: Three Nephi gave me chills, Jerry! When Jesus appears to the Nephites after his resurrection? Beautiful stuff!

ELAINE: How long do you think you'll last?

KRAMER: Forever! I'm committed. No coffee, no alcohol, no tobacco...

Waitress brings coffee to the counter. Kramer stares at it longingly.

KRAMER: ...starting after the baptism. They let you ease into it.

JERRY: That's not how it works.

KRAMER: Sure it is! Moroni 10:32: ""Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him."" Perfected, Jerry. That's a process.

George's phone rings. He answers.

GEORGE: (into phone) Hello? ... Sister Martinez! No, I completely understand... You what? ... You forgive me? ... You want to teach me the missionary lessons? ... Really? ... I'll be there!

George hangs up, ecstatic.

GEORGE: She forgave me! She said lying was wrong, but everyone makes mistakes, and if I'm sincere about learning, they'll teach me!

JERRY: Are you sincere?

GEORGE: I'm sincere about her! That's close enough!

ELAINE: George, you can't join a religion just to date someone.

GEORGE: Who's joining? I'm learning. And if I happen to marry a beautiful Mormon woman in the process, well, that's just a happy coincidence!

KRAMER: George, you gotta be careful. These people can see right through you.

GEORGE: Please. I fooled the Yankees for years. I can handle a couple of missionaries.

Knock on the door. Jerry opens it. Elder Anderson and Elder Peterson enter.

ELDER ANDERSON: Kramer! Ready for your baptism interview?

KRAMER: You bet! Let's talk commandments!

ELDER PETERSON: George, the sisters told us you're interested in taking the lessons?

GEORGE: Very interested! I want to know everything. Every single thing. Especially the parts Sister Martinez teaches.

ELDER ANDERSON: That's great! We can start tonight.

GEORGE: Tonight? Already? I was thinking maybe next week...

ELDER PETERSON: Why wait? If you're sincere, let's begin your journey toward baptism!

GEORGE: (panicked) Baptism?!

JERRY: (laughing) Now you've done it.

KRAMER: Come on, George! We'll get baptized together! It'll be beautiful!

GEORGE: I'm not getting baptized! I just wanted to—

ELAINE: Date Sister Martinez?

GEORGE: —learn about faith!

ELDER ANDERSON: Perfect! We'll see you tonight at 7:00. Bring a Book of Mormon.

GEORGE: I don't have a Book of Mormon!

KRAMER: (pulling one from his jacket) Here! Take mine! I have four!

Elders leave. George looks at the book in horror.

GEORGE: This thing is 500 pages!

KRAMER: 531 with the index! You better start reading!

All laugh. Freeze frame.

END

TAG SCENE: INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT

Jerry doing stand-up routine to camera

JERRY: I don't understand missionary work. You spend two years knocking on doors? That's not faith, that's door-to-door sales! And they do it in pairs - always pairs. It's like a buddy system. ""You watch me get rejected, I'll watch you get rejected. Nobody gets rejected alone!"" And now I find out they have sister missionaries too? When did that happen? Is there like a missionary catalog? ""I'll take two elders and a sister. Do they come in matching sets?""

Laugh track. Fade out.

My boyfriend says the stories aren’t true and that heads and tails have been created to make the stories seem worse than what they are. I reassured my boyfriend that I don’t care about the stories and it will not affect our relationship.

We have had fights and I vented to my friend about them. When me and boyfriend broke up, I booked Manchester with that friend for New Years and we ended up getting back together again. My friend and her partner have been through a lot also and I’ve always been there for her when she needed me, when she got back with him every time I never once judged her or got angry. 

I was meant to go out with her and another friend on a night out and when she found out I got back with him, she never followed up on the plan to go on that night out. She started posting stories of her and that friend on the night out, leaving me feel excluded and hurt. 

The next day she text me saying she heard another bad story about my boyfriend. He proved to me with evidence it wasn’t true. 

Her and her boyfriend got into another fight and she asked me to stay over to keep her company and I did without hesitation. I haven’t heard from her in a month and she text me randomly saying “hey are we still going to Manchester because I haven’t heard from you in weeks and I just want that sorted. The next payment is due Friday”. 

I replied to her msg saying I’d send it to her by then. She asked me meet me the Sunday for a coffee, the Sunday came around and no word. 3/4 days later she text me saying “hey that payment is due Friday. I asked her can we meet for a coffee and she said maybe Sunday if I want , that she is having a stressful week. 

Friends should be able to vent to each other. I feel she is making me choose between her and my boyfriend with  silent treatment. Yeah, we had fights but why does she feel so affected by it when as I said above, never given out to her for getting back with her boyfriend. 

What should I do ? I no longer want to go on the holiday as I feel she is just using me at this stage and my boyfriend also feels hurt about the situation. ",1,1765496074.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

**Catching Up**

We held each other. I don't know for how long. She felt so light, I could have held her like that for the rest of our lives. But eventually, I had to put her down. She looked behind me at the smiling faces.

I turned around. ""Cindy, this is my new family. _Our_ new family,"" I corrected myself.

Then I made the introductions.

""Princess Nyla-Sekhmet, of the Cat-kin people of Prydia Solaris. A far-off land to the South East. And... my wife,"" I announced with pride. Although we had been together, it was the first time I got to declare our status to the world.

Cindy's eyes lit up and she bowed. Nyla somehow glared and beamed at me at the same time.

""There is no need to bow. I gave up my title to be with my husband. And you can call me Nyla.""

Not giving anyone a chance to stop me, I continued the introductions. ""And this is Skia-Morna, our adopted daughter. Sovereign of the far Shadow Lands.""

""And this is Sweet, a Skinwalker. And one of the kindest people you will ever meet.""

""And lastly, we have Medusa, one of the most loving people you will ever meet.""

""And this is my sister Cindy, who I have missed and worried about for so long. I love you, Cindy.""

Cindy's eyes filled with tears. ""I love you too, Paul. And it's nice to meet my new family. Please, please everyone come in and sit down. I have to get Mother Sarah.""

She backed away, not taking her eyes off of me as if she was afraid I might disappear. ""Don't go anywhere. Promise?""

""I promise, Cindy. I'm not going anywhere,"" I told her as we gathered around one of the larger tables.

Nyla sat to my right and whispered, ""She's beautiful. And so mature for a ten-year-old. But I guess that makes sense.""

Before we could reply, Cindy came back holding the hand of an older woman. She wore a simple gray tunic and had deep, deep wrinkles on her face. The kind of wrinkles that you get from living a life in the sun.

We all stood as she approached. With her free hand, she beckoned us to sit.

Cindy introduced Mother Sarah to us as the High Priestess of the Kingdom of Grainsguard.

The High Priestess looked at me and said, ""And you, son, are the Key to Sanctuary.""

Someone gasped. I felt Nyla's hand tighten on mine. Cindy just looked confused.

""May I ask how you know? And what you know about Sanctuary?"" I asked.

Mother Sarah explained, ""I can see the magic. It's like a blue mist around you. As far as Sanctuary... the Church of Peace was started by a Steward from Sanctuary. A Shadow Hound."" She turned and looked directly at Skia.

Skia whimpered softly. ""We did good?""

**Legacy**

""Yes, my dear. Your people did very good,"" Mother Sarah explained. ""Your ancestors were charged with protecting and stewarding Sanctuary. And for thousands of years, they did so.""

She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.

""It is believed Sanctuary predates the Old Gods. Perhaps Sanctuary predates our world entirely. The creators of Sanctuary created the Shadow Hound species as protectors. I can see that spirit of protection radiating from you.""

Skia sat up taller, absorbing every word.

""But a great evil befell your people. Some believe it was a curse wrought by the Titans. No one knows for sure; it was so long ago. But what I can tell you for sure is that about five hundred years ago, before the total departure of the Shadow Hounds from Sanctuary, a small party formed the Church of Peace.""

She looked at the young girl beside her. ""Do you know the Church's statement?""

Skia, tears in her eyes, shook her head. ""No, Mother Sarah.""

Cindy, beaming, bounced up and down in her seat. ""May I recite it, Mother Sarah? I've been practicing.""

""Of course, dear child,"" Mother Sarah said.

Cindy stood up straight, clasped her hands, and recited:

""We're not rich, but we're generous. We're not violent, but we're fighters. We stand for those who cannot. And we will not falter.""

**Heartbroken Nostalgia**

After Cindy's congratulations, we talked a bit more. I noticed Cindy becoming quiet. Something was bothering her.

""Cindy, what's wrong?"" I asked.

Tears welled up in Cindy's eyes. Her bottom lip began to quiver before she said, ""We did falter. I did falter. I failed you, Paulie. You told me to get the Church to come after you, to save you. But we couldn't. We didn't have the resources. I'm so sorry, Paulie.""

She buried her head in my chest.

""No, Cindy. You did not fail me. You did exactly what I wanted you to do. You ran. You saved yourself. You did good. You did great,"" I reassured her.

""Really, Paulie? But you said..."" Cindy still looked unsure.

I lifted her chin so we could look into each other's eyes. ""I know what I said. I said it to get you to go. The brand kept me from escaping, but you weren't branded. You're free. And now, so am I. And I don't think I would be if you hadn't escaped.""

We continued to talk. Eventually, Cindy fell asleep in my lap. Mother Sarah had one of the other acolytes show us some rooms. After putting Cindy to bed, we spent the night.

**Broken Home**

The next day I told Cindy I needed to go to the farm. I needed to see it for myself.

Cindy had kept in touch with many of the neighbors who survived the raid. She explained that our neighbor, Mr. Henderson, had come up and laid our parents to rest.

We made our way to the old farm. The whole area was still recovering. Many of the farms would never recover. As we walked up the dirt road that led through the middle of the settlement, I saw the burnt-up building that was our home.

Cindy, her voice a whisper, pointed to the oak tree. ""Mr. Henderson said he buried them by the old tree.""

She took my hand. Nyla held my other. Sweet carried _Chain Breaker_.

The oak tree used to shade the house. After five years, you could still see where the flames had scarred the tree. No tombstones, or even a plaque. Just two scratches in the bark of the tree to indicate where they were buried.

Cindy pointed and said, ""Mr. Henderson said the longer scratch was Dad's.""

Tears in my eyes, I asked Sweet for _Chain Breaker_. I could see the confusion in everybody's eyes, but no one argued.

Using the spike of _Chain Breaker_, I carved a proper epitaph. The dwarven steel easily carved through the bark of the tree.

_A Father and Mother._ _Died trying to protect their children and home._ _They are loved and missed._

Once I finished, I felt Cindy lay her head against my side. Nyla wrapped her arm around me, as did the rest.

We stood there for a long moment.

We explored the burnt-out ruin of the house. Nothing was left that could have been saved. We walked down to Mr. Henderson and thanked him before going back to the Church of Peace.

**Goodbyes**

The next morning, in the meeting hall of the Church, I told everyone my plan. I planned to avenge our parents' murder and to free the other slaves.

""Cindy, I want you to come with us, but it's your choice. I see how happy you are here. And I can't guarantee you would be safe going with us,"" I told Cindy.

""Paulie, I don't want you to go, but I know you must. And I must stay here. Not because I'm afraid, but because this is where I belong. This is my home.""

1pkcg79,http://theamericailoved.com,Is the Trump fever finally lifting?,"There has always been racism in America but the difference was that, at least in recent history, the likes of the KKK and Proud boys stayed under the proverbial rock, at least for the most part.  What Trump has done is not only made it alright for them to come out from under that rock, but wear their racism as a badge of honor.

The problem for Trump now is that if he does not deliver (& there is no way he can), they will turn on him:

**Epstein files**: He promised them transparency and the heads of the Clinton’s (& other Democrats) as soon as he was sworn in. Here we are in 11 months later and no matter what eventually comes out, what is clear is that it will *not* be flattering to Trump. Trump will do his best to divert attention but this is a snake he cannot shed, and we must ensure that it is made public. My suspicion is that he will double down, as he usually does, & *pardon Ghislaine Maxwell!*

**Better economy**: I will not re litigate tariffs and there will be an inevitable, eventual impact on prices to the consumer. You do not have to take my word; just read the tea leaves Trump himself is serving us:

He introduced absurd tariffs on Brazil, until someone told him about coffee consumption in the US & how much of it comes from Brazil; so coffee is now excluded from tariffs. Similar thing happened with bananas and avocados, until someone told him that the US does not grow enough…I have a whole list but you get the idea!

He has announced subsidies to farmers. Problem is no farmer I know – not even the MAGA ones- wants a hand out. Also, even if he does cut a check this one time how do farmers replace their recurring income, going forward?

Third his rambling about “do not believe your lying hearts because let me tell you how you feel” may work, until the rent is due in early 2026 and we cannot pay it!

Lastly, Trump claims he will send us a onetime check for $2k to – as he puts it – “buy whatever Health insurance you want”. I have two questions for him:

1. When was the last time you shopped for health insurance Mr President? I just renewed for my wife’s relatively crappy policy and it went up to $1400 per month. I cannot imagine how much it would have cost, if my kids were still my dependents!

(2) My costs are recurring & your false promise of a check is one time?

**Better jobs:** Not going so well and will get worse in 2026. A lot of the people laid off are the ones who thought they were immuned, because they voted for him.

**Peace** in the world: How is that going?

**Manufacturing back:** I will be the first one to support him if he was not lying but let us assume he is not. Mr. President, my bills are coming due next month but even if they start building the factory tomorrow; it will take 10 years to build. What happens between then and now because you have pissed off everybody, other than Russia?

**White Christian America:** Leave aside how far removed from what Jesus preached his policies are; how exactly do the logistics work? Do we have enough qualified people to replace the doctor; nurses; teachers; tech CEO’s and workers…..

This relatively small MAGA base has been enough to terrorize people but not nearly enough to have elected him.  They will turn on him as soon as the raging fires reach their door step, as it invariably will. Someone recently showed me a sign that said something to the effect “Not all Maga are racists but all racists are MAGA”.

Trump now has only three options:

·       As he puts it: ""Experts are looking into whether the Constitution allows him to run for a 3rd term - as long as it is not 3 consecutive terms!"". I wonder how he would react if Obama said he would run against him, based on that theory? It would drive Trump crazy!

·       He deploys the army domestically. The media needs to keep naming the Admirals/generals/commanders who are actually giving the orders, as they did with the Venezuela boats. In fact, we need to single them out, lest they give similar orders domestically (as they inevitably will, one day). I know I am going to get push back for this but until we get transparency, we have to assume even the Admiral(s) are complicit. We need to remind these guys that history is littered with people who have been tried & convicted for ""carrying out orders"". They all need to play in the sun light - including the masked ice agents! We need to continue to upload photos & videos.

·       He puts in a puppet successor through Gerrymandering or rigging the next elections. Two reasons why that is unlikely. The cult following is about Trump & Trump only, who is increasingly sounding old, and even more senile & stupid, than usual. I suspect any successor will be eaten by the Republicans themselves, who will pretend to suddenly grow a spine, once Trump goes. Also, I do think there will be more Republicans retiring (ala Marjorie Taylor Green) and gerrymandering or not, the Republicans are in trouble.

1pkcfd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pkcfd2/theophobia/,Theophobia,"Do you think animals believe in their own gods? I stared at those words on my computer screen until they blurred. It was past midnight. The question sat there in my inbox like something alive, waiting.

I know this may sound crazy, but I’ve witnessed it firsthand. I’ve lost someone to this event—this phenomenon. Please respond. I can’t sleep. I can’t make sense of this. I need help. Please help. I’m just a sheep farmer and I need somebody to help me understand. Please reply. Please Dr. Grant, help me. —Charlie Saunders

My hand hovered over the keyboard. Animals with their own gods? My first instinct was to delete it—some teenager’s creative writing exercise, maybe. A prank. But then I saw the name again. Charlie Saunders. I knew Charlie. I’d been to his farm twice before, consulted on his flock’s behavior. He was the kind of man who measured his words carefully, who didn’t speak unless he had something worth saying. The kind of man who would never, never, send an email like this. Unless something had broken him.

I wrote back immediately, told him to come to my office in the morning. He responded within the hour. Just three words: I’ll be there. I’m an ethologist. I study animal behavior—how they think, how they feel, what drives them. It’s all chemicals and instinct, evolution and adaptation. There’s no room for gods in that equation. No room for the supernatural. At least, that’s what I told myself.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that question burning behind my eyelids: Do animals believe in their own gods? By the time dawn broke, I’d convinced myself it was nothing. Stress. Grief, maybe. Charlie had probably lost a family member and wasn’t processing it well. I’d talk him through it, recommend a therapist, and that would be that. I was wrong.

Charlie was already waiting when I arrived at my office. I almost didn’t recognize him. The man I’d met before had been robust, energetic—someone who smiled easily and often. The thing slouched against my office door barely resembled him. His beard was unkempt, more white than I remembered. His eyes were sunken deep into purple-black hollows, the whites shot through with burst capillaries. He looked like he’d aged ten years in the few months since I’d seen him. Like something had reached inside him and scooped out everything vital. “Dr. Grant,” he said. His voice was a rasp, like he’d been screaming. “Good morning.” “Charlie.” I tried to keep my voice steady as I unlocked the door. “How long have you been waiting?” He didn’t answer. Just shuffled inside when I opened the door, moving like his bones hurt.

I flicked on the lights—the fluorescent bulbs hummed and flickered before catching—and started the coffee maker. The familiar ritual did nothing to calm the crawling sensation up my spine. Something was very, very wrong. “The university looks good,” Charlie mumbled, staring at nothing. I poured him coffee with shaking hands. “Black, right?” A nod. Barely. I sat across from him and forced myself to look—really look—at what he’d become. His hands trembled around the cup. There were dirt stains under his fingernails. And his eyes… God, his eyes were the worst part. They had the hollow, haunted quality of someone who’d seen something they could never unsee. “Charlie, what happened—” His fist slammed into my desk so hard the coffee jumped in our cups. I jerked back, heart hammering.

“Don’t.” His voice cracked like breaking glass. “Don’t interrupt me. Please, Dr. Grant. I’ve told this story to everyone. The police thought I was insane. The reporters laughed. The priest at St. Michael’s told me I was blasphemous. The veterinarians—” He choked on something between a laugh and a sob. “The veterinarians said it was impossible.” Tears carved tracks down his weathered face. “You’re the last person I can tell. The last one who might listen.” His eyes locked onto mine, desperate and pleading and terrified. “So I’m begging you, Dr. Grant. Don’t say a word. Don’t tell me I’m crazy. Don’t tell me what I saw wasn’t real.” He leaned forward, and I caught the smell of unwashed clothes, of earth, of something else—something rotten and organic that made my stomach turn. “Just listen,” he whispered. “Listen to what the sheep did.” The fluorescent lights flickered again.

“A month ago,” Charlie began, his voice hollow, “I went to a livestock auction. Needed more sheep for the farm.” He wrapped both hands around the coffee cup like it was the only solid thing left in the world. “I had enough money to buy a few—maybe five or six at market price. But then I saw this man.” Charlie’s eyes went distant, seeing something I couldn’t. “He looked almost as miserable as I do now. Hollow. Like something had already eaten him from the inside out.”He had a small flock. Twelve sheep. And the price…” Charlie laughed, but there was no humor in it. “The price was criminal. He was practically giving them away. I should’ve known. I should’ve known something was wrong when I saw how happy he looked—no, not happy. Relieved. Like he’d just shrugged off a curse.”

His hands tightened on the cup until his knuckles went white. “But I didn’t think. I just saw the deal. The sheep looked healthy enough. So I loaded them into my trailer and drove home, thinking I’d hit the jackpot.” Charlie’s voice cracked. “Lauren was waiting when I pulled up. My wife—she was surprised I was back so early. ‘Goodness, Chuck,’ she said, ‘how much did all that cost?’ I told her it was a blessing. That I’d only spent half what I’d budgeted. She kissed me. Told me to keep them separate from the main flock until they all got used to each other. She didn’t want any fighting.” He stopped. Stared into his coffee like he could see her face in it.

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead. Outside my office, I heard footsteps in the hallway—another professor arriving early. Normal sounds. Normal world. But sitting across from me was something that didn’t belong to that world anymore. “I unloaded the sheep,” Charlie continued. “They looked fine. All except one.” His voice dropped to barely a whisper. “He was the biggest of the lot. And he was… different. The way he stood—it was like he was at attention. Alert. The others meandered like sheep do, but not him. He walked with purpose. Like he knew exactly where he was going and what he was doing. And the rest…” Charlie swallowed hard. “The rest followed him. Watched him. They didn’t act like normal sheep, but I figured it was just the stress of a new environment. New home. They’d settle in.” He looked up at me, and I saw something break behind his eyes. “I was wrong.”

The coffee maker gurgled behind me, the sound obscenely loud in the silence. “At first, everything seemed fine. Then a week passed, and it started.” His breathing quickened. “I woke up one night to a sound I’d never heard before. It wasn’t a normal bleat—it was… harmonizing. Like a hymn. Multiple voices finding the same note, the same rhythm.” My skin prickled. “I thought it was coyotes at first, or maybe someone stealing from the pens. So I grabbed my shotgun and my boots and went out the back door.” Charlie’s eyes were unfocused now, lost in the memory. “My regular sheep were fine—sleeping, grazing, acting normal. But the new ones…” He stopped. His jaw worked like he was chewing on words too terrible to speak. “They were gathered in a circle. Heads bowed. Eyes closed. And that sound—it was coming from him. The leader. He was making that hymn, and the others… they were worshipping.”

The word hung in the air between us like something physical. “I walked closer, and he stopped. Just… stopped mid-note and stared at me.” Charlie’s voice shook. “Dr. Grant, I know how this sounds. I know sheep don’t have expressions like people do. But I’m telling you—I felt what he felt. Rage. Pure, cold rage. Like I’d interrupted something sacred. Like I’d walked into a church and spit on the altar.” He wiped his face with a trembling hand.

“It scared me. Really scared me. But then my brain kicked back in and I yelled at them to scatter. They didn’t move at first. Just kept that circle, kept their heads down. Then the leader bleated—just once—and they broke apart. But he kept staring at me. That anger… it was human.” Charlie’s voice was barely audible now. “I tried to rationalize it. Maybe the previous owner had trained them somehow. Maybe it was some behavioral quirk. I didn’t know. But it was wrong. Everything about it was wrong.”

He looked up at me, and I saw the tears threatening to spill over. “Then,” he said, his voice dropping to a growl, “that’s when the real trouble started.” He stared down at my desk, unable to meet my eyes. “Every few nights, I’d hear it again. That bleating song. And it wasn’t just the one sheep anymore—others were joining in. Some of my sheep, from my original flock. I’d catch them the same way every time: gathered around him, heads down, eyes closed. Sometimes they all sang together. Other nights they’d move in patterns—formations. A dance, almost. Lauren saw it too. We were both terrified, but we didn’t know what to do. Who do you call? What do you even say?”

His hands were shaking so badly now that coffee sloshed over the rim of his cup. “After three weeks of this, I dug out the paperwork from the auction. Found the seller’s number and called it.” He laughed bitterly. “It was disconnected. Didn’t exist. So I tried looking up the man’s name, his address, anything.” Charlie looked up at me, his face a mask of despair. “Nothing. Not a damn thing. It was like he’d never existed at all. Like he’d sold me those sheep and then vanished off the face of the earth.”

The fluorescent lights flickered again. “Or maybe,” Charlie whispered, “he was just running from the same thing I should’ve run from.” Charlie’s voice dropped to barely a whisper. “One day, I went out to the grazing fields. That’s when I saw it.” He stared at his hands like they belonged to someone else. “There was an impression in the ground. At first, I thought my eyes were playing tricks—that my brain was conjuring patterns from nothing. But no.” He shook his head slowly. “It was a perfect circle. And inside… symbols. Symbols I’d never seen before. Not in any book, not in any language I knew.”

The office felt smaller suddenly. Colder. “Something had changed. The whole farm had this weight to it. Like the air itself was pressing down. Like something vast and terrible was unfolding right beneath my feet, and I was too small, too stupid to understand it.” He stopped. Drew in a shuddering breath. Tried to gather the pieces of himself that were falling apart. I realized I hadn’t touched my coffee. The cup had gone cold in my hands. Everything Charlie was saying sounded impossible—fantastical, like some fever dream or elaborate hoax. But the man across from me wasn’t lying. Whatever he’d seen, whatever he believed he’d seen, had destroyed him.

Charlie paused, his fingers tracing the rim of his coffee cup. “I should’ve paid more attention to Lauren. Should’ve seen the signs.” His voice cracked. “But I was so focused on those damned sheep, I didn’t notice what was happening to my wife.” He drew a shuddering breath. “It started about a week after I brought them home. Lauren complained of headaches—said they came on suddenly, like something was pressing against the inside of her skull. She’d never had migraines before. I told her to see a doctor, but she kept putting it off. Said they always passed eventually.”

Charlie’s eyes went distant. “Then I started finding her at the bedroom window. Middle of the night, just… staring out at the fields. At the pens. The first time, I asked her what she was doing. She didn’t answer at first. Just kept staring. When I touched her shoulder, she turned to me with this dreamy expression and said, ‘The singing is so beautiful, Chuck.’” His hands trembled. “I hadn’t heard anything. Told her she must’ve been dreaming. She just smiled—this empty, far-away smile—and came back to bed. But it kept happening. Three, four times a week. Always at the window. Always listening to something I couldn’t hear.” He leaned forward.

“She started humming. These strange, droning notes—nothing I recognized. She’d do it while cooking, while folding laundry. When I pointed it out, she’d look confused, like she didn’t even know she was doing it. The headaches got worse too. She’d stop mid-sentence sometimes, freeze up, stare at nothing. Then she’d blink and come back, but she’d have tears on her face. Or she’d be smiling. She could never remember what she’d seen.” Charlie’s jaw clenched. “One morning I found her outside in her nightgown, barefoot in the wet grass. She was standing at the fence, and that leader—that thing—was on the other side. Just the two of them, staring at each other. And she was humming that melody again.” His voice dropped.

“I called out to her. She turned, and her eyes were… empty. Glassy. Like she was looking through me at something else. But then she blinked and suddenly she was confused, frightened. ‘Chuck?’ she said. ‘What am I doing out here?’ She didn’t remember walking outside. Didn’t remember any of it.” He pressed his palms against his eyes. “It went on like that for two weeks. The humming, the staring, the headaches. She’d black out sometimes—just collapse and clutch her head, saying something was trying to push its way inside her mind. Trying to show her something.” Charlie looked up at me, his face twisted with anguish . “Then, three days ago, she had a moment of clarity. A real moment. I came home from checking the fences and found her in the kitchen, crying. Actually sobbing. She grabbed my arms and looked at me—really looked at me—and I saw my Lauren again. The real her.” His voice broke. “‘Chuck, something’s wrong with me,’ she said. ‘I’m losing time. I’m hearing things. This morning I woke up and found this.’ She showed me her hands—there was dirt caked under her fingernails. Fresh dirt. ‘I don’t remember going outside. I don’t remember digging. But I can feel… Chuck, I can feel something calling me. And I’m scared. I’m so scared because part of me wants to answer.’”

Tears welled in Charlie’s eyes. “She was terrified. Terrified of herself. Of what she was becoming. She begged me—begged me—to get rid of those sheep. Said we had to do it immediately, that very day. But I…” He choked on the words. “I told her we’d do it tomorrow. That I needed to prepare, to figure out where to take them. I thought we had time. I thought one more night wouldn’t matter.” He slammed his fist on the desk.

“But they knew. Those things knew she was breaking free. Knew she was fighting whatever hold they had on her. So they didn’t wait. They couldn’t risk losing her.” Charlie’s voice became a hollow whisper. “That night—the last night—Lauren seemed better. Calmer. She made dinner, kissed me goodnight, told me she loved me. Said tomorrow everything would be okay. We went to bed early, both of us exhausted. Both of us believing we’d wake up and fix everything.” He looked at me with eyes full of horror.

“But when I woke to that song… she was already gone. Already theirs. Whatever small part of her that had fought back that afternoon—it didn’t matter anymore. They’d taken her completely.”His voice cracked.“And I let it happen. I gave them one more night

Fresh tears welled in Charlie’s eyes. “Then came the night Lauren died.” The words hit like a punch to the chest. “Charlie, I’m so—” His hand shot up, cutting me off. His face twisted with something beyond grief—something raw and primal. “That night, Lauren and I talked. Really talked. We’d both had enough. The farm felt wrong. Corrupted. We decided we were getting rid of those sheep—the next morning, we’d load them up, drive them out to the middle of nowhere, and let nature take its course.” His voice cracked. “I know how that sounds. I know. But Grant, you have to understand—the horror of that song. I still hear it. When I sleep. When I’m awake. It never stops. It’s maddening.” His expression shifted from grief to something far worse—the hollow-eyed stare of a man teetering on the edge of sanity.

“We went to bed early that night. Thought tomorrow everything would be fine. We’d be free. We could have our normal life back.” He laughed—a broken, ugly sound. “But we weren’t free. We were never going to be free.” Charlie’s breathing quickened, his chest heaving. “I woke up to that song again. But this time it was louder. More aggressive. Like something vast and powerful was clawing its way into our world. And Lauren—” His voice broke. “Lauren was gone.” I gripped the armrests of my chair. “I threw on my boots, grabbed my rifle, and ran outside. Every single sheep—every single one—was arranged in a circle. No, not one circle. Three rings. Staggered. Concentric. And in the center…”

He couldn’t continue. His whole body shook. “Lauren was there. Standing with the leader. Her face—God, her face was blank. Empty. Like she wasn’t even there anymore. I screamed her name. Nothing. No response. She just stood there like a sleepwalker.” Charlie’s fists clenched. “I’d had enough. I raised my rifle and aimed at that thing—that leader, that devil that had brought this curse into my home. I pulled the trigger.” The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. “The bullet hit him. I know it hit him. I saw him flinch. But there was no blood. No cry of pain. No wound. It was like I’d thrown a pebble at him. Like he was made of something that couldn’t be hurt by anything in this world.”

Charlie looked up at me, and I saw hell reflected in his eyes. “Then Lauren laid down in the center of the circle.” His voice was barely human now—a tortured rasp. “And they started stomping on her.” I felt my stomach drop. “All of them. The leader first, then the others closed in. They trampled her with the force of draft horses. Her blood—” He choked. “Her blood sprayed up into the air. Covered them. And they kept singing. Kept dancing. Every sheep had to touch her. Had to be anointed in her blood, her guts, her—” He couldn’t finish.

“I just watched. My mind screamed at me to run, to stop them, to do something. But my body wouldn’t move. I couldn’t comprehend what I was seeing. It felt like hours—watching my wife trampled to death while they sang their hymn.” Charlie’s tears fell freely now, dripping onto my desk. “When they finally stopped, they arranged themselves in a semicircle. The leader in the very center. He looked up—not at me, but at the sky—and began to sing again. The others joined. The sound… it made my head split. My vision blurred. But I saw it. God help me, I saw it.""""Saw what?"" I whispered.

Charlie's eyes went hollow, staring through me at something only he could see. ""At first, I thought it was a cloud. A mass of darkness descending from above. But clouds don't move like that. Don't breathe like that. It was massive—so vast I couldn't see where it ended. Just this endless black shape covered in thousands of eyes. No, not eyes. Apertures. Openings. All of them fixed downward. All of them watching.""

His voice dropped to barely a whisper. ""And there was a sound coming from it. Not words. Not music. Something that existed before language. Before thought. A sound that made my bones vibrate, made my teeth ache, made my heart skip beats."" He gripped the edge of my desk until his knuckles went white.

""But it wasn't just a creature, Grant. It was a presence. A deity. I could feel its attention like weight, like gravity, like the hand of creation itself pressing down on me. On Lauren. On the blood-soaked earth. And in that moment—that terrible, crystallizing moment—I understood."" Tears streamed down his face.

""I understood why ancient peoples built altars. Why they dragged victims to mountaintops and temples. Why they offered up their children and their livestock and their enemies. Not out of love. Not out of devotion."" His voice cracked. ""Out of terror. Out of the desperate, animal hope that if they fed it enough, if they gave it what it wanted, it might pass over them. Might leave them alone for one more season. One more year."" Charlie looked at me with eyes that had seen too much.

""We call them myths—those old gods, those hungry gods. We think we've evolved past them, that we've buried them under science and reason and progress. But they never left, Grant. They've been here all along. Waiting. And the animals—the animals never forgot. They've been worshipping them since the beginning. Since before we even stood upright.""

His voice became a rasp. ""And that night, I watched my wife become their sacrament. I passed out, and when I awoke to the rising sun... All the sheep were gone. Every single one. The only thing left was…” He couldn’t say it. “Lauren’s body.” Charlie began unbuttoning his shirt with trembling fingers. He pulled the fabric aside to reveal his chest. There, burned into his skin, was a symbol. A perfect circle surrounded by intricate runes—characters that looked ancient and alien and wrong.

“I found this the next morning.” He touched the symbol on his chest, wincing as if it still burned. “It wasn’t there before. I didn’t carve it. Didn’t brand myself. I just woke up and it was in me. Part of me.” His voice grew quieter, more distant. “At first, I thought I could live with it. Thought I could bury Lauren, sell the farm, move away and forget. But the dreams started that very night.” Charlie’s eyes glazed over, seeing something I couldn’t.

“I see him. The leader. Every time I close my eyes, he’s there. Standing in fields that stretch forever. And he’s not alone anymore, Grant. There are thousands of them now. Flocks upon flocks, all standing at attention, all watching me. All waiting.” His hands began to tremble. “And behind them—behind all of them—I see it. That black mass. That thing they worship. But in my dreams, I can see it clearly. I can see its shape, its purpose. And it’s so much worse than what I saw that night. So much bigger.” Charlie’s breathing quickened, becoming shallow and rapid. “The symbol burns when I dream. Burns like fire, like acid. And I hear voices—not words, but meanings pushed directly into my mind. They’re teaching me things. Showing me things. The rituals. The hymns. The hunger.” He looked up at me, and I saw something had changed in his eyes. Something had broken.

“I tried to cut it out, Grant. Took a knife to my own chest. But the blade wouldn’t go deep enough. Wouldn’t cut. It’s like the symbol protects itself. Like it wants to stay in me.” His voice cracked, climbing in pitch. “I went back to the farm three days ago. I don’t know why. Something pulled me back. And I found them, Grant. I found the sheep. Not mine—new ones. Different flock, different owner. But they were already there. Already gathering in circles. Already learning the songs.” Charlie grabbed my wrist, his grip painfully tight. “It’s spreading. It doesn’t end with one flock. It moves, it infects, it teaches. And every night I dream, I see more farms. More fields. More flocks standing at attention, ready to call down their god.”

Sweat beaded on his forehead. His pupils were dilated, unfocused. “Last night—last night I dreamed I was one of them. I was standing in the circle, head bowed, and I could feel it, Grant. I could feel the ecstasy of worship. The joy of surrender. And part of me—God forgive me, part of me wanted to stay there. Wanted to bow down and sing that hymn forever.” His voice rose, panic bleeding through. “I’m losing myself. Piece by piece, I’m becoming something else. Something that understands them. That sympathizes with them. The symbol is changing me, rewriting me from the inside out.”

Charlie stood abruptly, his chair clattering backward. He paced like a caged animal. “I can hear it now. Even awake. That humming. It’s in my head, in my bones, in every heartbeat. It won’t stop. It won’t stop.” He clawed at his ears, his chest, leaving red marks.“I tried to pray. Went to three different churches. But every time I kneel, every time I try to say the words, I feel it watching. Laughing. My prayers turn to ash in my mouth because I know—I know—there’s something older listening. Something that doesn’t care about mercy or salvation or redemption.” His voice cracked into something between a laugh and a sob. “I’m not sleeping anymore. Can’t sleep. Because every time I close my eyes, I’m back in that field. Back in that circle. And Lauren is there, Grant. She’s there, but she’s not dead. She’s standing with them. Standing and singing. And she looks happy.”

Charlie spun to face me, tears streaming down his face. “Is she in heaven, Grant? Or is she with them now? Is her soul trapped in that thing’s belly, singing hymns for eternity? Tell me! TELL ME!” He slammed both fists on my desk, sending coffee cups flying. “I can’t make it stop! The burning, the dreams, the knowing! It’s teaching me their language, their rituals, their purpose! And the worst part—the absolute worst part—is that it’s starting to make sense!” His voice rose to a desperate wail. “Grant, I understand them now! I understand why they worship! I understand what they’re building! Every flock is a congregation, every farm is a temple, and they’re all working together to bring something through! Something vast and hungry and patient!”

Charlie grabbed my shoulders, shaking me. “It’s not just sheep, Grant! What if it’s all of them? What if every animal—every bird, every insect, every creature we’ve dismissed as mindless—what if they’re all worshipping? What if we’re surrounded by tiny churches, by millions of altars we can’t see, all calling to gods we never knew existed?” His grip tightened painfully. And what if we’re next? What if the symbol marks me as the first? What if I’m supposed to teach others? What if that’s my purpose now—to spread this to people?”

I tried to pull away, but his strength was manic, inhuman. “I won’t do it! I WON’T! I’d rather die than become their prophet! I’d rather—” He stopped suddenly. His eyes went wide, pupils dilating until they were almost entirely black. “Oh God. Oh God, it’s here. It’s in the room with us.” “Charlie, there’s nothing—”

“DON’T YOU SEE IT?!” he screamed, pointing at the empty corner of my office. “It’s right there! All those eyes! All those mouths! It’s been watching this whole time! It’s been listening!” He released me and staggered backward, clawing at the symbol on his chest. “It won’t let me go! It won’t let me die! I’m its witness! Its PROPHET! And it wants me to spread the word! It wants me to teach others to see! To hear! To WORSHIP!” Charlie collapsed to his knees, screaming—a sound of pure anguish and terror that seemed to come from somewhere deeper than his lungs. It was the sound of a soul being torn apart.

“GRANT, HELP ME! HELP ME! CUT IT OUT! CUT ME OPEN AND RIP IT OUT BEFORE IT TAKES EVERYTHING! BEFORE I BECOME—” His body convulsed. Blood began trickling from his nose. I lunged for the phone, my hands shaking so badly I could barely dial. “911, I need help! My office at the university—someone’s having a medical emergency—” The paramedics arrived within minutes, but Charlie was barely conscious by then. He thrashed weakly as they loaded him onto the stretcher, his lips moving soundlessly.

As they wheeled him past me, I leaned in and heard him whisper: “It’s already too late. The mark is spreading. You touched me. You listened. Now you’ll dream too.” Then his eyes rolled back and he went still. The police took my statement. I told them about his wife’s death, his grief, his obvious mental breakdown. I didn’t mention the sheep or the rituals or the symbol. Who would believe me? That afternoon, Detective Morrison called.

“Dr. Grant? This is about Charles Saunders. I’m sorry to inform you that he passed away at County General about an hour ago.” My blood ran cold. “What happened?” “Massive cerebral aneurysm. The doctors said it was like something burst inside his brain. Multiple vessels, all at once. They’d never seen anything like it.” A pause. “There’s something else. Something strange.” “What?” I said in shock. “When they were preparing the body… they found burns. Fresh burns all over his torso, his arms, his legs. Symbols, Dr. Grant. Dozens of them. Like someone had branded him repeatedly. But there’s no sign of external trauma. It’s like they burned from the inside out.”

The phone nearly slipped from my hand. “The coroner wants to list it as unexplained. But between you and me?” Morrison’s voice dropped. “I’ve been a cop for twenty years. I’ve seen drug overdoses, psychotic breaks, every kind of mental breakdown. But the look on that man’s face when he died…” “What about it?” “He wasn’t afraid anymore, Dr. Grant. He looked relieved. Like dying was the only way to escape something worse

Months passed. Charlie’s story haunted me. It shouldn’t have—it was madness, trauma-induced delusion. Sheep don’t have religion. They don’t perform rituals. They don’t summon gods. But I couldn’t forget the symbol burned into his chest. The terror in his eyes. The way he’d screamed. Eventually, I moved to Texas. New job. New start. I tried to bury what Charlie had told me beneath work and routine. Then I got a call from a rancher outside Austin. Said he needed help with his flock. Behavioral issues.

“What kind of issues?” I asked. There was a long pause on the other end of the line. “Well, hell, Doc—you’re going to think I’m crazy. But my sheep… they’re singing and dancing at night.” The phone nearly slipped from my hand. “What did you say?” “I know how it sounds, but I swear—they gather in circles and make this sound. Like a hymn or something. And they move in patterns. Like they’re performing some kind of…” He trailed off. “Some kind of what?” My voice was barely steady. “Some kind of ceremony.”

I closed my eyes and saw Charlie’s face. Heard his screams. “I’ll be there tomorrow,” I said. I hung up the phone and sat in the silence of my office for a long time. I’m a scientist. I’ve spent my entire career explaining animal behavior through biology, through evolution, through reason. Neurotransmitters and instinct. Stimulus and response. Everything has a rational explanation. Everything follows observable laws.

But what if we’ve been wrong? What if faith isn’t just a human invention—some evolutionary advantage that helped us cooperate, that gave us comfort in the face of death? What if animals have always known something we’ve forgotten? Something we’ve spent centuries trying to bury under logic and empiricism and the desperate belief that we’re alone in this universe?

What if there are powers in this world that demand worship? That demand sacrifice? I opened my laptop and pulled up Charlie’s last email. Read those words again: Do you think animals believe in their own gods?My hands were shaking. Because if sheep can have gods—gods real enough to answer their prayers, gods hungry enough to manifest in our world—then what else is out there? What other creatures are kneeling before altars we can’t see? What other rituals are being performed in the dark corners of the world while we sleep in our beds, believing we’re the only ones with souls?

And the question that terrified me most, the one that kept me awake for the rest of that night: What do those gods want with us? I packed my equipment the next morning. Loaded my truck with cameras and recording devices. Told myself I was going to document everything, to find the rational explanation, to prove that Charlie had simply witnessed some bizarre behavioral anomaly. But as I pulled onto the highway heading toward that ranch outside Austin, I felt it—that same heaviness Charlie had described. That weight pressing down. Like the air itself knew something I didn’t.

Like something vast and terrible was watching. Waiting. And I understood, with the cold certainty of a man walking toward his own damnation, that I wasn’t going to find answers in Texas. I was going to find the same thing Charlie found. The same thing that’s been there all along, just beyond the edge of our understanding. Hungry gods. And they were waiting for someone new to witness them.",12,1765495787.0,nosleep,2,0.94,False

1pkceyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/soloboardgaming/comments/1pkceyx/my_solo_year_in_review/,My solo year in review,"Here's a completely unsolicited recap of the 2025 year of solo gaming.  I'd love to hear your feedback on what I'm missing out on or if you have any questions regarding my experience with the games below.  

Just a bit about me, I started my solo journey in 2024 after picking up a little game called Spirit Island.  I wanted to learn how to play the game before giving it a teach, and I've yet to teach it still!  I played over 100 games of SI last year, and this year I wanted to branch out a bit and see what else solo gaming had to offer.  Here's what I went with (yeah, it was a bit much) and some brief thoughts on each:  


New to me in 2025

1. It's a Wonderful World - love the engine building in this one, very simple to setup, and quick to play.  The solo challenges had some variety to BYOS and some of the expansions add a small campaign challenge too.  Love this one!
2. Maquis - I was so excited about this and really struggled finding it, but reached out directly to the publisher and snagged me a copy.  Then in playing it I haven't loved it as much as I thought I would.  I believe it's the ""card counting"" portion knowing what locations will likely get pulled next that I don't enjoy.  I'll probably end up purging this one but I had such a hard time finding it I'm having a hard time letting it go. 
3. Black Sonata - Got this at the same time as Maquis and was pleasantly surprised - this hidden movement deduction game has really been up my alley.  Definitely a keeper!
4. Orchard - Got this at the same time as Maquis and Black Sonata.  It's a cute little 10 minute puzzle that can easily setup for a second game quick.  It's enjoyable, one of the lighter games I can pull out quickly if desired.
5. Terraforming Mars Ares Expedition - another engine builder and love the card design on how you can take actions.  I'm wanting to get the Crisis expansion to add a little more solo variety but I really enjoy the base game itself.
6. Imperium Classics - I love deck building, and the different civilizations adds a lot of varieties and complexities which gives the game a lot of depth to explore.  My only complaint is the time it takes - it's a little on the longer side so doesn't hit the table as much.
7. Dorkromantik - I really enjoyed this tile layer.  Impossible to lose, just fun to see what you can unlock and then what your top score could be.  Light and enjoyable.
8. Raiders of Scythia - Garphill is one of my favorite publishers, and Raiders of Scythia is a good one for me.  Love how they incorporate the bots to simulate an opponent in this one.
9. Ark Nova - I was a little intimidated by this one, but so glad I gave it a shot.  Polyomino games scare me a little, but there's so much engine building in this and the card system is great.  I've only played the base solo mode and will eventually give ARNO a shot too, but it's just a great game.
10. Coffee Roaster - I don't drink coffee, so was a little hesitant on the theme, but this plays really well.  I love how you have a three game campaign so to speak that progressively can get more difficult depending on how well you did.  I go to this when I'm looking for something a little lighter.
11. Dune Imperium Uprising - I've certainly heard the criticism that this is much better multiplayer, but end of the day I don't have anyone that wants to play this multiplayer so solo it is.  I've got to get some more plays under my belt to really get better with all of the characters, but love the deck building / conflict resolution.
12. Ezra and Nehemiah - Another Garphill game I added this year, and probably the heaviest of their games I have in my collection.  I love the theme and how you can go several directions as you play.  Need to play it some more.
13. Fliptown - I saw this mentioned so many times in the sub I finally gave it a shot, and now I get why people enjoy it so much.  I love the cowbot opponents and I've played through the campaign.  It's enjoyable for sure, although a little on the lighter side.
14. Turing Machine - I love math puzzles so this one was a clear winner.  There's so much replayability here it's just amazing how they got the coding system to work.  And playtime is super quick - easy to play several games in just a matter of minutes.
15. The Elder Scrolls: Betrayal of the Second Era - I'm a Skyrim sucker and have hundreds of hours and multiple copies of the game over the past decade.  This box is huge, and the campaigns are longer than what I typically have time for, but I'd love to really get into a groove to play this more to explore all of the different builds.  
16. Dragons of Etchinstone - didn't know much about this, but I wanted to explore what a gamefound type purchase would be like.  Just got a copy in earlier this week and I've got a couple of plays in.  Good little travel size game, although I feel like there's a lot of luck in the card shuffling at least at first glance.  Time will tell how much I enjoy this.
17. Palm Laboratory - I was looking for easy games to take with me on business travel, and this is a fun little game that fits the bill.  It's OK, but I found in hand games are maybe not something I want to become an expert on.  
18. Kingdom Legacy - I really wish you could replay this game... I opened it up one night, started playing, and didn't go to bed until the game was completely finished.  Really enjoyed it, but haven't bought a second copy at least at this point.  
19. Galdor's Grip - My first dive into PNP and while that was more work than I thought it would be, I really like this game.  If I were to play a palm game, this is probably the one I'm reaching for.  It lives in my backpack I take with me on travel, but don't play it a ton.
20. Mage Knight - I had seen this recommended so much I finally had to take the plunge.  Oh my goodness, what a game.  It's such a time commitment I've kind of kept it to the side for now, but wow can I see what people are talking about.
21. Trailblazers - I wanted a little travel tile layer and this one works well.  I wouldn't choose it over Cascadia or Harmonies at home, but on the road I really enjoy it for a quick puzzle.
22. The Anarchy - I got Hadrian's Wall last year and LOVED it.  After finishing the campaign, I had to get a copy of The Anarchy.  It's more difficult IMO, but I really enjoy the solo campaign and how it mixes up the challenges.  Takes a little longer though, so it will be a while before I can finish this solo campaign.
23. Skara Brae - Again, love Garphill, and while I knew very little about this, I took the plunge based on reputation really.  And it turned out to be one of if not my favorite release of 2025.  Love the resource management in this one, just wish there was some sort of solo challenges or something.  Can be pretty difficult to win too.
24. Sleeping Gods Distant Skies - I wanted to try my hand a story based campaign game, and went with Distant Skies.  I like the combat well enough, probably the exploration a little more, but start to finish it's a big time commitment.  I'll likely play a time or two more, but it's a beast to setup and really don't want to play hour long sessions that have more time setting up and tearing down than playing.
25. A Gentle Rain - I think if there was a picture for cozy solo game, A Gentle Rain would be it.  Very easy to get the table, just a fun little tile layer, and can easily be taken on my trips.  
26. Cyberion - first shot at the Oniverse... and I like this one quite a bit.  The art is cute enough, but I personally love the variability of the different powers. 
27. Eila and Something Shiny - Another attempt at a campaign game.  I loved the gameplay variability chapter to chapter, and played it through multiple times to get the best ending.  
28. Final Girl - horror is just not my thing, but I went ahead and got this knowing that the gameplay itself had to be good.  And it is, the gameplay is fantastic, and I personally really like the magnetic boards as I feel they are quite clever.  But I still don't enjoy horror, so not sure how much I'll really play this.
29. Aeon's End - The game I've played most is Dominion, and then I got this game which quickly became my most played solo game of the year.  I really enjoy the deck building in this one, love the variable nemesis battles, and really enjoy the expedition system.  I went a little crazy and bought a number of big and small expansions to give me some variety - I'll be playing this for a long time to come.
30. Forest Shuffle - I didn't realize this had a solo mode until a couple of weeks ago, but I love this game.  I play with the exploration expansion instead of the fan made variants, and feel like that expansion has enough variable goals and point targets that I can play for a lot longer.  
31. Onirim - Oniverse part 2, with all the shuffling.  I've barely started playing it but can once again see why people love these games.
32. Regicide Legacy - I had never played Regicide but went straight to the legacy box after hearing how well put together it was.  And I must say, the quality of the game parts is great.  I've barely started on the campaign, but love that you can continue to play after you've finished.
33. Welcome to the Moon - One of the new games in my collection, but love the campaign style of this one.  Haven't played through all of it, but really enjoyed what I have played so far.

Purged in 2025

1. Akropolis - my wife got this for us to play, but she didn't enjoy it much.  For solo it was OK, but with Cascadia, Dorfromantik, Harmonies, A Gentle Rain, Trailblazers... I had plenty of tile laying games.
2. Eila and Something Shiny - really enjoyed the story in this and liked the gameplay as well.  But after a couple of playthroughs, I thought the story was complete and there was no need to keep such a large box that likely won't get played again.
3. Gloomhaven Jaws of the Lion - one of my first solo games I got last year when I started broadening my horizons a bit.  Really enjoyed it at first, but eventually got frustrated by some of the combat modifier cards (pulling a 0 at the very end of a mission and losing happened more than once).  I think it's a very well made game and for the value it's great, just wasn't for me.
4. Legacy of Yu - I love Garphill Games typically, but after figuring out a method to spam the game to basically never lose, I didn't really see the need to continue playing.  Love the idea of a medium size campaign that can be reset and have some variability.  I hope they balance out the game better for a potential future iteration.
5. Resist! - for some reason, this just didn't click with me.  I know Witchcraft! is a similar game play mechanic and might be a little better polished, but I went with Resist! as the theme was better for me.  I constantly got destroyed and eventually just gave up.  
6. Warp's Edge - another one of my first solo games I got last year.  I really enjoy deck building, so figured bag building would be a slam dunk, but found myself really irritated getting my big hands into those bags.  Crazy reason to purge a game but I wasn't playing it because of that so got rid of it.

Wishlist for 2026

1. Lost Ruins of Arnak - I was a little hesitant to get the base game only, but just resigned myself that I really need to get some of the expansions for good solo play.  The deck building / worker placement combo though certainly looks like something I would enjoy.
2. Unstoppable - I love deck building, people seem to love this game... looks like a slam dunk for me.
3. Leviathan Wilds - the puzzles look great and it looks to be a game that I could easily take with me on business travels that also has a lot of variability to it.
4. Primal the Awakening - The game is huge and expensive, but the game looks really intriguing and I don't have any truly dedicated boss battlers in my collection.  
5. Probably most important, but play more of the hits I already have in my collection.  More playing, less collecting... easier said than done I know.

And I guess the last note for 2025, but I started to help mod this sub.  Keep those game names in the title people, and be kind to one another!  And I'm sure we could use another mod or two if anyone is interested!",25,1765495757.0,soloboardgaming,11,0.94,False

My boyfriend says the stories aren’t true and that heads and tails have been created to make the stories seem worse than what they are. I reassured my boyfriend that I don’t care about the stories and it will not affect our relationship.

We have had fights and I vented to my friend about them. When me and boyfriend broke up, I booked Manchester with that friend for New Years and we ended up getting back together again. My friend and her partner have been through a lot also and I’ve always been there for her when she needed me, when she got back with him every time I never once judged her or got angry.

The next day she text me saying she heard another bad story about my boyfriend. He proved to me with evidence it wasn’t true.

Originally known for dominating the liquid restaking meta, they have rapidly evolved into a full-suite financial powerhouse.

To get the full story, we sat down with Rok Kopp, Co-founder of EtherFi, for our an episode of the BMX Crypto Podcast. Rok took us through their journey from a restaking protocol to launching a consumer-facing cash card and their plans for 2026.

At BMX, we are building the productive liquidity layer of Base with products like wBLT and Deli Swap, designed to make your capital as efficient as possible. EtherFi shares this DNA, building tools that allow you to put your assets to work rather than letting them sit idle.

This conversation is a blueprint for the future of decentralized finance.

# The Game Changer: The Non-Custodial Cash Card

[The Non-Custodial Cash Card](https://reddit.com/link/1pkceb6/video/cl57fu5uqn6g1/player)

The standout product discussed was the EtherFi Cash Card. Unlike traditional crypto cards that often require you to sell your crypto to load a balance, this card functions more like a secured line of credit. It is over-collateralized, meaning you keep your assets in the vault (earning yield) and spend against them.

""It allows people to get into the US dollar... and you can be mobile,"" Rok explained. It’s a massive unlock for digital nomads or those in countries with unstable currencies, allowing them to transact globally without constantly opening and closing bank accounts.

Best of all? It’s self-custodial.

# Vaults: A Liquidity Access Line

[A Liquidity Access Line](https://reddit.com/link/1pkceb6/video/wl706cbrqn6g1/player)

Rok broke down a strategy the their liquidity vaults. Users can deposit ETH to earn yield (e.g., \~6%) via managed DeFi strategies, and then borrow against that collateral at a lower rate (e.g., \~4%). This allows users to access liquidity for daily spending via the Cash Card while maintaining exposure to their assets and earning a net positive spread.

As Rok put it, ""It’s a liquidity access line... managed in a safe manner.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# The Strategy: Saying ""Yes"" to Liquidity

[Saying \\""Yes\\"" to Liquidity](https://reddit.com/link/1pkceb6/video/lp95w8aqqn6g1/player)

How does EtherFi choose where to deploy?

Rok’s philosophy is simple: Liquidity is king. Especially for a payment product that requires real-time transaction speeds, liquidity on L2s is non-negotiable.

""Say yes to everything,"" Rok said about their partnership strategy.

Whether it’s putting weETH on Scroll, Linea, or Base, the goal is to ensure users never hit a wall where they can't use their assets. This type of agnostic, user-first approach ensures that EtherFi assets remain the most useful forms of collateral in DeFi.

Why build in crypto? For Rok, it’s about more than just ""number go up."" It’s about efficiency. He noted that the traditional financial world is filled with ""95 intermediaries taking 10 bps each from our capital.""

EtherFi's mission is to cut out those middlemen, allowing users to participate in society day-to-day while keeping their money productive.

While admitting the industry is 24/7 and can consume anyone working in it, Rok emphasized that the reward is building a banking alternative where capital efficiency is the default, not the exception.

# The Road Ahead: EtherFi Trade & 2026

[Looking at 2026](https://reddit.com/link/1pkceb6/video/08uclvtjrn6g1/player)

Looking to the future, Rok dropped some alpha on EtherFi Trade, an upcoming product that will allow users to trade perps directly within the platform, further integrating the experience of earning, borrowing, and trading.

With a presence confirmed for ETH Denver and a continued push into institutional offerings with partners like FalconX and Anchorage, the goal is scale. ""You gotta get to a larger scale... adding 10,000 \[users\] a day if you really want to start making a dent,"" Rok admitted. The vision is clear: become the default financial app for the crypto economy.

# The Future of Finance is Hybrid

The gap between DeFi degens and everyday spenders is closing fast.

EtherFi is proving that you don't have to choose between self-custody and convenience. By combining yield-bearing vaults with real-world payment rails, they are building a system where your money works for you 24/7, even while you buy your morning coffee.

At BMX, we are building the liquidity engine that powers this kind of efficiency on Base. Whether you are farming yields with wBLT or spending them via EtherFi, the future is about making every asset productive.

A few months after that het texted me. I rejected him again, but agreed to a ""one last cup of coffee"" since he was supposedly moving countries. That coffee meeting was the third time I ever saw him and he said he loved me. I rejected him again.

Fast forward to this year, I met him three times since he said he would take it slow and stop being so pushy. I had a good time initially, but by the third date I noticed he was getting obsessed again. I had to reject him once more.

Now it's been another half year later and he still hits me up! I was very clear last time about not sharing his feelings, but he just keeps trying. At this point it just feels disrespectul, as if he doesn't understand the word ""no"", but I also know that I f-ed up big time by giving it another shot in spring.

Around a year ago, I started eating one meal a day. I moved to an office that is dirty and gross and I can’t bring myself to eat there. So I stopped eating lunch and I have never been into breakfast. I have about 4oz of whole milk with maybe like 12oz of unsweetened coffee in the morning, then I start eating at dinner, which we cook from scratch most nights, and maybe have a snack like a bowl of bran or some crackers or something before bed.

I have never been hungry for breakfast or lunch. I always forced myself to eat lunch because I thought I had to. But I don’t miss lunch at all.

In the past year, I’ve lost 12 pounds without trying, I’m finally almost not overweight, and my cholesterol and stuff is now in the healthy range on blood tests. I have more energy and just feel better. I’m moving to a new job again soon in an office that is hopefully not so dirty and gross and thinking maybe I can eat lunch again. But do I really need to? Eating lunch causes me a lot of emotional distress with the OCD and since I’m never hungry at noon, it exacerbates my symptoms. When I’m actually hungry, OCD is much more manageable with eating food which triggers all of my symptoms. I don’t enjoy eating.

Is there any real harm in getting up at 7am and not eating until 7pm if I don’t feel hungry?

1pkc9nf,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1pkc9nf/i_stalked_him_into_loving_me/,I stalked him into loving me,"WARNING: I know this is super long, but I really needed to get it off my chest. 


From the very beginning I knew he was mine. I met him 8 months ago at a local grocery store. He met me about 6 weeks ago at a coffee shop. I’ll never forget the day I was graced with his presence. It felt as though it was love at first sight. Though, I discovered, love is not a two-way street, sometimes you have to make a u-turn and keep following the person in front of you until you find your way home. 

I remember the day like it was yesterday, he was pushing his shopping cart, and I found myself filled with jealousy, for the first time, over an inanimate object, as I wished I was the one he had his hands wrapped around. The jealousy only continued to simmer, as I continued to peek through the aisles watching him as he delicately placed items in his cart. I knew right then and there how kind and gentle he could be, wishing so desperately I was the one he was running his fingers across and picking up. To be manhandled by him felt like a dream I never wanted to wake up from. I wanted so badly to run up and greet him so our story could begin, but I knew deep down it was too soon, barely grasping on to my patience, I continued to shop while gazing at him. Minutes felt like hours, and just as my mind started to take a deep dive into my fantasies of us together, I saw him make his way to the checkout line, knowing this was my chance, I followed shortly behind him. Though I didn’t have the courage to speak up then, I was met with inspiration, as I heard the cashier ask for his rewards number, fortunately he had one, I could have fallen right then and there when I saw him smile ever so slightly as he began to speak, his voice was husky, yet sweet like honey, he began to read off his number, so I pretended to text someone and opened my notes app, quickly writing it down. Time began to speed up, and before I knew it he was saying thank you and walking away. Before sadness could dampen my mood, I rushed home and looked him up. After 45 minutes and a few sketchy websites, I found him. 

It was from the point on that I started to feel a bit like a stalker. I looked at every photo, found the schools he attended, checked his LinkedIn to see what jobs he worked, and of course, sifted through every follower he ever had to make sure there were no girlfriends/partners. To my surprise he was, in fact, single. Even though I knew I was in love, I felt like I was beginning to know too much. I mean, I had even found out where he went to elementary school and checked some digital archive library to find all his old yearbook photos, and I was truly in awe. The more I learned, the more I was in love, so I decided to finally try and meet him. I fixed up my social media profiles, changed my academic background to match his a bit and decided to follow him. It took a few months and hours of perfecting my posts, but he finally liked one of them. I remember my heart almost stopped, I was even tempted to keep note of the day he noticed me, but I decided to play it cool and wait a few hours before DMing him and asking if we’ve met before because he looked familiar and I noticed he liked my post. Of course he didn’t remember our first real meeting at the grocery store several months prior, but one thing led to another and we became friends. He would message me memes and cute cat pictures and I continued to fall in love with him. 

But, things really started to change a few weeks ago when he asked if we could meet up irl and get coffee. I remember the second time I saw him in person, my heart was fluttering and my skin was warm to the touch, my thoughts were racing, and I couldn’t stop thinking: “hot Americano with a splash of cream and a croissant on the side,” before I knew it, he ordered my exact thought. I was worried I’d get his order wrong but months of research proved me right. Though, I was happy to discover he actually asked for his croissant heated up, so I want to remember that for next time too. We got our drinks and sat at the nearest table. He was just as sweet and kind as I remembered him. He even grabbed me a napkin when I spilt my drink a little. We laughed and talked for hours. At the end he walked me to my car and asked me out again, but in a more romantic way, he told me I was even prettier in person and that speaking to me was like speaking to someone he had known his whole life. I knew it’s because we’re soulmates, so I told him I felt the same way in a kind of joking manner, but it definitely did not feel like a joke. 

I was in love and it felt like he was beginning to feel it too, but after our 5th date he told me “I love you.” It was better than all the thousands of fantasies, my heart literally felt like it was throbbing, how could one human be so incredible, I wish I recorded it, but experiencing it was so much better. I responded by saying I “loved” him back, but I feel bad because he doesn’t know that I’m not just responding to his “I love you,” I really have loved him for almost a year now, but he has no idea. Every sound, movement, and breath he takes, every piece of him I loved, and will continue to love because it’s him. He finally sees me, and I’ve always seen him.

For one, I spend a lot of time in nature, and travelling the country. We still have the most naturally beautiful places I've ever seen with my own eyes.   
  
Secondly, the amount of young Canadians, even in cities and on university campuses, engaged in conservative politics is inspiring. They're having conversations about what conservative values are in 2025, what kind of Canada they want to create instead of hanging their hat on being anti-liberals. Here's an article on exactly that: [https://www.withoutdiminishment.com/p/the-kids-are-all-right](https://www.withoutdiminishment.com/p/the-kids-are-all-right)

Speaking of Without Diminishment, we've got more high quality non-legacy media sources for conservative views and debate than I can remember. I hadn't heard of Alexander Brown or Rudyard Griffiths or Sean Speer until this year (maybe that's on me). These guys are doing a lot of good work. I went to Project Ontario to see the ""Yahoos"" as Doug Ford called them. Everyone was a class act. 

Generally I've seen a real move to the right, or at least to the sensible, during this minority liberal government and not all at the federal level. The MOU, the military budget expansion, private healthcare is polling higher than ever, and immigration may still be partisan for now—but it isn't taboo anymore.   
  
People are recognizing that rents and immigration are tied together, that lower immigration pushes rent down. People are recognizing it's not right to bring people here just so they can ride ebikes in -12 C weather, or serve coffee when teenagers can't find employment. 

Next year the NDP are going to have a leader, which I am excited about because they aren't going to steal conservative vote share, and they can't do any worse than the last guy. Also the climate supporters within the liberal party are ready to jump ship now that Carney signed the agreement-to-agree-to-a-future-agreement. 

Carney has proven he is not the politically-skilled statesmen he billed himself as. I actually don't think he's been terrible in terms of Trump, who is himself slipping into biden-brain territory, but Carney certainly isn't the ""tough fighter"" voters thought they were getting. Not to mention Mark seems to write one future attack ad against himself per week. He's supposedly about to appoint his fellow finance bro, who literally founded the Century Initiative, as Ambassador to the US. That's some poor political judgement. 

We still have insane levels of wealth below our feet, and momentum and political will to access them are building in every province from BC to Newfoundland. Not just O&G, but gold, fertilizer, nickel, rare earths, etc. 

Conservative provinces are growing while Liberal provinces shrink and age. Alberta is growing and staying young, can't say the same for Ontario or Nova Scotia. Parliamentary representation is is inevitably trending conservative. 

The conversations we're having now about sovereignty/separation can make Canada what it should be: a federation of culturally distinct and sovereign provinces willingly working together to economically out-compete the US and the EU. A nation with a strong military and borders. You can laugh, but Texas requested to succeed after Obama won again in 2012. They're doing fine now. 

I foresee 2026 being a year of change.

Um amigo meu de confiança quer me vender uma RTX 3060 Ti MSI Gaming X 8GB por R$ 1500. Ele comprou a placa em fevereiro de 2023 e só usou pra jogar e uso normal do dia a dia, nada de mineração e afins.

O porém: semana passada uma das fans caiu KKKKK. Ele comprou o conjunto inteiro do cooler/fans (“motor” da placa) e vai mandar arrumar/trocar certinho

Meu setup hoje é:

* Intel Core i5-8400 (Coffee Lake)
* Placa-mãe Gigabyte B365M Aorus Elite
* 32GB DDR4 3000 MHz
* GTX 1060 6GB
* Fonte 450W

Meu PC já tá veinho e quero trocar/upgrade ano que vem. Para os jogos que eu jogo até tá ok, mas me sinto bem limitado e quero ir migrando aos poucos. Se eu pegar essa placa, já vou trocar a fonte junto; o resto deixo pra mexer ano que vem.

Minhas dúvidas:

1. R$ 1500 nessa 3060 Ti Gaming X usada tá de boa ou tá caro?
2. Trocar o conjunto de cooler/fan assim é tranquilo?
3. Vindo de uma 1060 6GB, vocês acham que esse upgrade vale a pena pro meu setup (com i5-8400 por enquanto) ou melhor segurar a grana e mirar outra coisa depois?

1pkc40z,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1pkc40z/is_this_emotional_abuse_or_my_ptsd_and_all_my/,Is this emotional abuse or my ptsd and all my fault ? Long post .,"Okay so I've read like every post on here and I need some clarity on my own situation for my own mental clarity I Am a 29f and my partner was a 27m . I am diagnosed with ptsd and anxiety after surviving a severely physically abusive relationship a few years ago were I almost died . I am also an empath who loves to take care of people . I don't shout or swear and hate arguments . Me and my partner have been together since last August . We met at a festival and he was living with a friend at the time after being released from prison after a 4 year sentence for non violent ​ offences . Because of wht I've been through in the past I was very upfront with him about my history of dv and he assured me he was understanding soon long story short this year and a half has been hell . He moved in after the first night and smokes 3g of cannabis daily when we met he had tons of promises to get it together when he was off probation so I wanted to help him and I am such a caring person I did everything for him . He has no phone no car no bank card so I let him use my bank to get uc . I let him use my car . He started getting weird when after literally a week he wanted to know everything about my past and people I was with previously I was open about it as we live in a small area and he knew one or two of the people but it was years ago and nothing serious. He starts constantly going on about this accusing me of being a liar and sleeping with people I hadn't . He spent everyday with me for like a month and then starteddemanding I took him to his friends house a 30 might drive away and pick him up usually super late at like 11pm at night even though I was exhausted and had been working all day if I refused he would threaten to move back to his friends and say I was a hater and stopping him from seeing his f friends . He had no money and when he had no cannabis he would just sit there silently ignoring me watching YouTube shorts making me super uncomfortable so I offered to buy it for him . This turned into a everyday thing now most of my money was going on cannabis from work and I had 0 . again not a lot but I quickly realised everytime he didn't have it he would take it out on me. Around Christmas he was like we should get a ps5 then it started we had a nice Xmas and I had hope but then he got ""sick"" he refuses to help me decorate the house or put up furniture or clean or basically do anything he said he was sick and just layed in bed on ps5 for hours playing with girls as well as boys and when I would  try and speak to him he would pull a face and ignore me I did everything and always have cook clean drive etc . during this time I felt sick myself and out it down to stress . I was pregnant and he didn't give a shit he told me he wasn't ready so I ended up having an abortion that left me with an infection for months he would still expect me to drive him everywhere despite me really being sick and offered no care or sympathy for me . when we had no money for petrol he would fly into a rage and throw things smash stuff and say I was stopping him seeing friends and blame me for everything I was sleeping on the floor as he would elbow me purposely in the night and call me names of I woke him up . Around this time in March after looking after him for months the fits had got worse he walked out on day of my abortion. And would threaten to leave constantly . Then  I found him cheating with someone on discord on my own phone he called me a slag didn't apologise and said I'm not even with you after me looking after him for months !!! he blames me I was so shocked I threatened a break and he did apologise but that's when he started calling me a ducking slag almost daily .. Okay that's just March March until now will be continued just reading this is so ducked up here's a list since but omg I broke up with him by text 3 says ago to his friends phone as he doesn't have one and I don't know why I miss him so much i keep blaming myself please help ..

Okay so then I went on a holiday in March with my mum and my sister and while I was gone he was acting like a needy child saying he was hungry etc I was ready to end things then but then I got a large sum of money and he started saying i wanted it all to myself that was why I didn't want to be with him etc so I spent most of it just in us and living I didn't get anything for myself then I got a puppy who he did love but didnt help with at all . He is still gaming constantly and refuses to let me speak he has a microphone on constantly and I can't use my living room if I speak he pulls a face at me or says the microphone is on I can't even say his name .the past few months have been exhausted he got off probation but continued the same shit . Instead of getting a job he put himself down as my carer .even though I am killing myself doing everything alone and he didn't help with anything her was still calling me daily names . After he broke my car and then left me at the side of the road I left him but then begged for him back because he said it's all my fault I just chat shit and all he does is innocently sit on the ps5 it's all me I lied to him I went on holiday etc . After that I keep breaking up then going back it's never him apologising or reaching out I've cried so so many times i feel so so stuck I feel like I !miss him now but I know it needs to be final he says he loves !e but doesn't show it I keep thinking is me because these last few weeks he has money he has finally left and not reached out or bothered me when in the past he would never leAve I feel he's just going to meet someone else who isn't ducked up like me n be good to her ​​​​​​​​​

Calls me names daily . refuses to help me and ignores when I ask. Rarely plans dates . Drives dangerously with me in the car . Says he doesn't want to speak to me and ignores my conversations then will speak to his friends for hours . Smashes my belongings . Shouts and bangs things even though it triggers my ptsd . Never apologises for anything he literally goes on the ps5 from minute he wakes up then maybe watched a show for an hour with me then goes to bed and makes me coffee that's. He also like just invades and takes stuff and uses it as his own he also owes tons of people money and never pays them back plus he still does have a phoneme bank card like omg why do I still love him . Guys I need real help how can I become normal again",1,1765494958.0,emotionalabuse,23,1.0,False

So I bought tickets to the Saturday show the day they went on sale, been looking forward to it for months and of course my family schedules their holiday party on the same Saturday as the show.  Family first and all that, as much as it pains me alas we can't go.  So I'm making the tickets available, not trying to make money on it or anything just looking to get the $134 I paid.

Seats are front row balcony AA 23 and AA 24.  First come first dibs.  I'm up in Vancouver and happy to meet up if you want the printed copy (tho I head to Seattle on Fri afternoon for said party), otherwise I have the tickets ready to email.

1pkc38d,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoShillReviews/comments/1pkc38d/review_of_owala_smoothsip_slider_insulated/,"Review of Owala SmoothSip Slider Insulated Stainless Steel Coffee Tumbler, Reusable Iced Coffee Cup, Hot Coffee Travel Mug, BPA Free 12 oz, Vanilla Bean","The listing is selling a 12-ounce Owala tumbler for $24.99, which is a lot of money for a cup that holds less than a can of soda. The marketing copy leans hard on the leak-proof lid and the stainless-steel body, but it never explains why a 12-ounce cup needs to cost more than twice what a 20-ounce competitor does. The reviews are glowing, yet they read like a mix of genuine enthusiasm and the sort of generic praise that could apply to any insulated cup.

If you already own a reusable cup, the only new feature you’re getting is the sliding spout, and that’s a thin value proposition for the price. The cup is not microwave-safe, the lid is not dishwasher-safe, and the steel walls mean it’s heavier than plastic and will dent if you drop it. The narrow mouth makes it hard to add ice or clean the inside, and the narrow base means it will wobble in a car cup holder.

In short, you’re paying a premium for a brand name and a color that looks like melted vanilla ice cream. If you need a cup that keeps coffee hot for the commute, a $5 gas-station mug does the same job. If you need a cup that keeps ice water cold for a hike, a $3 Gatorade bottle will do. The Owala asks $25 for the same job, and the only real difference is that the lid is a little more fiddly to clean.

The reviews are glowing, but they read like they’re written by people who are just happy to have a new cup, not because the cup is anything special. The listing is using the same marketing language every insulated cup uses, and the price is set by the brand, not by the value the cup adds. If you need a cup, any $5-$10 store brand will do the same job, and you can get a 20-ounce one for the same price. The Owala is a $25, 12-ounce cup that’s selling the idea that it’s special, but it’s not offering anything you can’t get for a fraction of the price elsewhere.

1pkc0y5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1pkc0y5/husband_frequently_criticizes_and_uses_my_anxiety/,Husband frequently criticizes and uses my anxiety against me,"I have social anxiety which I've struggled with for years. A lot of it has to do with having been bullied over my weight, something which led to an eating disorder in my teens. I was anorexic for years before I regained the weight, and then some, back. My weight made me more anxious. I wore baggy clothes to hide it. I became more introverted than I already was as a result. We met online around this time. He told me that he didn't mind my weight. As time went on, I gained more weight, and my anxiety got worse. I became reclusive and was teetering on the edge of agoraphobia. 

I started wearing a mask, hoodie, and sometimes sunglasses when out in public. He told me that he was the last person who'd ever judge me over this. That he wore a hoodie and sunglasses because of his anxiety before. After a while I wore the hoodie, and mask, not just because of my anxiety but because of issues with my hair and teeth. These were caused by my eating disorder, neglect due to depression, and drinking. They came to be in the year before we met when I gained more weight. I told him about this, though didn't go into too much detail, and he said he loved me no matter what. 

I managed to start losing weight, slipping back into disordered eating in the process. When we met I was around 10lbs overweight. I had my hoodie, mask, and sunglasses on. He rejected me, as I expected he would, after he was overly sexual and pushy with it online. He also acted embarrassed of me in public. What he talked about wanting to do online like holding hands, or wearing commitment rings, he was no longer interested in. He said he disliked PDA and a ring wouldn't suit him. He didn't refer to me as his gf at times and said it was too personal, or was unnecessary. I didn't talk to people. I'd ask him to ask employees questions for me and he'd refuse.

He blamed his anxiety. One time, after he refused to ask a female employee something, he quickly walked off and hid behind a rack of purses after she started walking towards us. Another time he freaked out in Hollister standing beside a female employee, begging me to let him wait outside. He asked me to go back to the UK with him. I needed a passport for this. He encouraged me to take the mask, and hoodie, off. He helped me with the issues I had with my hair. We went back to the UK and he knew I would avoid people, and struggle to talk to them, but he encouraged me to talk to his parents and his grandmother. 

I tried to talk to them, and managed to do so at times. I found it easier to talk to his grandmother because she'd start the conversation, something I hate doing, and she'd keep it going. She seemed to actually want to talk to me. It was different with his mother as she was less talkative. He'd try to tell me what to say to her but that didn't help. It made me more anxious instead. I stopped wanting to talk to her as much after he badmouthed her, something he also did online, telling me she was moody and volatile. She's bang around the kitchen and he'd say she was in a mood. He said she called him a c*nt randomly. 

He told me she didnt like quiet people. Her dad was quiet growing up. I figured she was judging me. He snapped at me a few times for not being able to talk to people. I was quiet around his friend, who he was trying to avoid, claiming it was because of how he felt about himself. His friend seemed to understand, acknowledged I was shy, but he called me inept. He would tell me people were looking at me in public when I was upset or even looked it. He told me I needed to do exposure therapy, face it head on. We were downstairs making dinner a night his brothers ex gf was staying over. He told me to leave as she could come down.

He said she was chatty and would talk to me and ask questions about America. I said I didn't think so. That if she did, I'd try to handle it. He demanded I left. He got on medication he said killed his libido. I lost weight, he showed more interest, and he engaged in PDA and did other things he wouldn't do before. I continued to ask him to ask employees things for me, or look to him to respond, whenever they were trying to talk to me. He complained about this making him, and me, look stupid. I pushed myself to speak to an employee, after he refused to go in anywhere with me if I didn't. I struggled a bit but thought I did well. I said I was proud of myself and he said the same. 

A minute later he said she frowned at me. She had a mask on since it was during COVID. I asked why he said that and he said he didn't know. Now he claims it pissed him off. I asked how he could tell she frowned and he said it was in her eyes, her expression. Right after that we went to an ATM and he told me two guys were laughing at me. When I got upset, and said he was trying to bring me down, he ditched me in the city. I continued to talk to people but still had issues. I hid an item at a store for an acquaintance, who I didn't intend to interact with, and she showed up and said thank you. 

I said you're welcome and walked off, thinking the conversation was over. He told me she gave me a funny look. He said it seemed she was going to say more and I kind of just walked off. Another time a cashier was rude to me. I tried to remain calm and thought I had checked out. I didn't hear her when she was still speaking to me, as he claimed she was. After he complained about how awkward this situation was. I felt like he was constantly judging me and my every move. If I accidentally bumped into someone, or didn't move out of their way, he'd comment on it as I mistakes couldn't be made. I wasn't allowed to comment on his anxiety without him getting offended. 

He has criticized me for how I talk, if I'm too quiet or too loud, things that I say, how I act. One time I looked back at him and smiled and he seemed uncomfortable, and asked why I did that, looking into the aisle at the female employee as we passed it. Another time he looked over at a woman when I laughed. He was often looking around himself, usually at women, whenever I spoke or before he responded to me. He'd also go quiet on me around people and walk off. Yet, when I did either of these things to him, he asked me if I was embarrassed of him or if I was trying to appear single. 

During COVID I wore a mask, including after people stopped wearing them. He crticized it and pushed me to get vaccinated, calling me stupid for not wanting to. I eventually gained weight back, and he showed less interest in me. He said it had nothing to do with my weight, that it never did, but when I reached the weight I was when we met he insulted me over it during an argument. He said I let myself go. As I continued to gain weight he called me fat and ugly, and said guys prefer thinner women. He said he didn't mean it and only said it to hurt me. That I said similar to him over his weight, weight he gained shortly after we met. 

He started acting differently in public, similar to how he was at the start, talking to me less and standing apart from me. He walked off when I was speaking to him, as well. He blamed it on anxiety. Once, when I was excited and scoffed having found a dessert I was looking for, I looked up to find him giving me a disgusted man's judgemental look. He said it wasn't aimed at me, that he was uncomfortable, because we were two fat people scoffing at sweets. We argued, I said it felt personal, and he commented on the thin couple that were next to us who not once looked over. I started wearing my mask and baggy clothes again. 

I tried to step out of my comfort zone, wear what I wanted to, and not hide more than once. Only for him to criticize my outfits, say they didn't look good, after he said they did. He told me this in public. He also criticized my mask on and off. He said it looked stupid, that people were staring because of it, and kept pushing me to take it off. He didn't want me at the mechanics with him when I had it on, having me wait at the exit gate, when I'd previously gone to the same mechanics with the mask on. He criticized an ourfit I wore one time. A baggy hoodie he said made it seem I wasn't dressed properly. 

This is after telling me before that baggy clothes makes bigger people look worse. He didn't want to go into the grocery store with me wearing it. He also criticized a purse I got for being too small, and looking disproportionate with my body. He didn't send to want me to wear purses at all. He seemed surprised, and uneasy, whenever I tried wearing a purse of mine after a long time of not wearing one. He has complained still that I don't talk enough to people, and that it is awkward, though over time I've made a lot of progress. He doesn't seem to acknowledge this, or care. 

I've tried several times to step out of my comfort zone. He told me people where he volunteers invited me inside to wait, or for a cup of tea, but the two times I tried to take them up on this offer he discourged me. He told me one of the times that I'd be too anxious. When I said I'd handle it he told me that if I did, he'd question the validity of my anxiety. Later on he said it would've been akward. I could've sat there mute. Another time he questioned if I have anxiety when I wanted to go somewhere in town on a busy day. This is after years of us not going many places, and him blaming it on his anxiety. 

He's fine going places, and interacting with people alone. He says he has such bad anxiety but is studying to become a counselor. He also volunteers at a crisis call centre. Yet, he calls my anxiety into question. He encouraged me for years to talk to his grandmother, to visit her with him, and I'd be quiet during the visits though I'd talk some. He said this was okay. This past year, however, he has discourged me from seeing her more than once. I've seen her once in 8-9 months. He said that it was awkward because I am mute, and don't talk much. Now he's encourging me to see her for christmas along with his mother, and his brother, who I haven't ever interacted with. 

He said we could go on Christmas eve instead. I don't want to go at all. He says, as with everything, that he said what he did about it being awkward during an argument as if that cancels it out. He seems more focused on how he looks than anything else. I don't think he has anxiety. When we went to a beach a year ago he tried to help me down a slippery rock face, offering me his hand, which I didn't take because I didn't trust it. I thought I'd lose my balance. I sat and slid down. He looked around and said how awkward it was I didn't take his hand. When I got upset, he said I was overreacting and argued with me. 

Today he told me his therapist was confused by me being able to go into stores with my anxiety. He said that was the wrong word. That she acknowledged my anxiety was pertaining to small talk. When he is the one who doesn't seem to have anxiety. We went got coffee and the person at the drive thru was rather rude, making unnecessary comments. I went to leave a bad review and he said to post it anonymously because his friend, who he doesn't interact with and avoids, could see it. He also said ""Is that several paragraphs"" before seeing that it wasn't. 

We argued, and I mentioned what he did at the beach, which he said was abusive acknowledging he imposes his anxiety on me but expecting me to not be angry. We went into a store after this and he told me to take my mask down. When I got upset he lied and said someone was behind us, saying sorry to them, before admitting no one was there. Another thing he's done, using real and imaginary strangers against me. He said he told me this because he was angry, but other times he means well, and that he doesn't think there's any reason I should hide my face, that I am pretty.

I moved to London at the beginning of this year and have been enjoying my days a lot (apart from the days in winter when it was dark by 3 pm...). I'm from Canada and decided to move here to fight my inner demons (Read: I wanted a change of pace and experience European culture).

I want to meet a girl to go to museums with, to visit Christmas markets with, to have coffee and talk deep topics on the balcony at 10 pm with, to go on weekend trips to Italy and see Roman statues and have authentic pizza with, but most of all, someone who simply enjoys my company as much I enjoy theirs.

About myself, I'm 26, Asian, 6 feet, and ever since I moved here, I've been doing a hella more cooking so I'm sure I can whip up a feast for you when you visit! I play games a lot on my PC, and my most played recently is Dead by Daylight, it's the only game where you can see characters from Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Halloween, and Alien all work together to repair some scuffed generators.

I've been playing Silksong and suffering from the bosses like everyone else, but I think it proves that I'm into masochism :) I've been takin German classes for the past weeks and I'd say that sie sind sehr interessant.

Its been years but it still pisses me off. I cant let go of the anger?","This was years ago but the anger has not let me yet, I got reminded yet again. In uni I started to talk to a woman that showed me interest, she added me on social media, we talked and she said yes when I asked her out. We had a dinner date and coffee date a few times, she even came over to my place to study. As I had never had a girlfriend before, I was a bit shy. I had a good friend in uni who was like a brother to me who I told about this to, and he did not even know this girl, but later he took her away from me. He started talking to her despite knowing I liked her and that I had been on a few dates with her etc.

This piece of shit lied to me saying they are just friends, but the girl started ignoring me when my ""friend"" got closer to this girl. I confronted him and he started sending snaps of them out and drinking, then claiming they are just friends. I was infuriated, and confronted him. Because I knew the truth. This woman had been to my place even. This motherfucker took her from me because she had told him she never had a relationship before, and he wanted to be with her since she had no prior experience with someone, so he started telling her bad stuff about me so she ignored me, he basically backstabbed me.

I am so fucking angry. He looks like shit too. I dont understand how he got her.

I just saw a pic of them again. I am so pissed of. Going to drown my sorrows in vodka now so I can sleep.

Once, I took a stray kitten to the veterinary clinic, and she didn’t charge me. So the next day I went again and bought some kitten food, and the day after that I went again with a different excuse, lmao. But every time I went, we had these small talks. As a shy person, I don’t even know how I found the courage, but the next day I grabbed some cold coffee for me and her and went there with great confidence. I told her, “I felt like you were going to ask me out for a coffee but couldn’t find the right time, so I saved you from the trouble of thinking what right time and brought you one.” (It hits different in Turkish.)
She gave the biggest laugh — I thought I failed — and then she told me to wait two minutes. She went out, grabbed some cake from the bakery next to the clinic, and said, “Now it’s better.”
So we started dating.



And the second one was a dentist, and it was very risky in a country like Turkey — it could have backfired so badly — but I took my chance.

After she finished her work, she asked me how the experience was. I said, “It always felt like an adult movie in the dentist’s chair with all those tall things going into my mouth, but this time I actually enjoyed the things in my mouth,” and I winked at her, lmao.
I don’t even know what that was supposed to mean, but she burst out laughing, probably thought I was stupid, and somehow we talked more — and she gave me her personal number

Before we got married. She was kind, loving, caring, thoughtful, and supportive. 
Since marriage she has been none of those things. 

To keep things short I'll stick to the bullet points or else I'd end up writing a novel. These things also didn't start immediately. It was a death by 1000 cuts situation where she started changing things over time to where they are now. 

I do all the housework. Cooking, cleaning, laundry, vacuuming, mopping, etc. The only time she ""helps"" is to rant about how bad I do something and ""show"" me the right way. 
I shouldn't need time with my friends. My family should be enough and I'm ""awful"" if I want to waste time with family to see friends. She has friends over or we meet them somewhere for dinner or activities. 

Same as above for hobbies. My hobbies are stupid, they're a waste of time, and picking a hobby over family is ""rediculous"" Asking for her and our son to do something I enjoy is also stupid. 

Her parents are constantly. CONSTANTLY, around. 2-3 times per week. But I don't need to see my parents because I'm ""not a child"". 

She can spend whatever money on pretty much whatever she wants. However if for instance I splurge on a good coffee vs whatever bucket of mud is on sale I get lectured about wasting money. 

She can call me names, belittle me, cuss me, and threaten to divorce me. I called her a bitch one day in a knee jerk reaction to her telling me to ""stop being such a pussy"" because I had the flu and she holds it against me and throws it in my face constantly. 

If I try to talk to her about something that she does that bothers me she turns around and lists everything she could ever imagine that she doesn't like about me. But expects me to change everything at once and makes no effort on her end. 

I could continue, but you get the gist. Yes, she does still have redeeming qualities. I do love her deeply. But I'm currently also deeply unhappy with my life in my marriage and honestly I don't know where to go. I've tried to talk to her. But she puts everything on me. Yes, I'm clearly not perfect. Especially now. I mostly just sit in silence and do nothing because it's honestly easier than fighting every second of the day.

* **placa mãe gigabyte b365m aorus elite**
* **32gb ddr4 3000 mhz**
* **gtx 1060 6gb**
* **fonte 450w**

a dúvida é:

1. **R$ 1500 nessa 3060 ti gaming x usada tá de boa ou tá caro?**
2. trocar o conjunto de cooler/fan assim é de boa?
3. vindo de uma 1060 6gb, vocês acham que esse upgrade vale a pena pro meu setup ou melhor segurar a grana e mirar outra coisa depois? trocar o pc inteiro ou por partes?

I 3d print my own designs, clean them up a little and outsource the casting. The pieces come back and I go straight into the following workflow…

1. Remove sprues with a jewellers saw, clean them up with a sanding barrel (most of my sprues are on the inside of the ring)
2. Use a cut 2 triangle escapement file on any tight areas (been working on the prints much more to prevent the need to go in heavy)
3. Use a cut 4 file to remove the casting skin from the whole piece (lots of flat faces so no flex shaft)
4. Use my emery sticks and coffee stirrers with sandpaper glued on from 320 grit up to 800 on the entire piece (was recommended this as I can’t afford a full set of Swiss files, I just bought 2 recently 😅)
5. Rotary tumble for 30-40mins
6. Flex shaft with yellow dialux (Tripoli equivalent?) and then white dialux 

The video I’ve attached is part way through the sanding step and I’ve put in about 3-4 hours already. I know this piece in particular would take longer than others because of the amount of flat faces I’m trying to maintain but I’m sure that real bench jewellers wouldn’t take anywhere near as long as this piece will take me. 

If you’ve got any advice to give or recommended changes to my workflow I would reaaaaaally appreciate it! Sorry for the long read and thank you for your time 🙏🏽

1pkbsr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pkbsr2/should_i_call_him_out_for_lying_about_a_girl/,Should I call him out for lying about a girl?,"There is a man I liked a lot who I thought also liked me. At least he told me he did. We got involved emotionally pretty heavy for about 6 months, saying I love you and saying were love with each other, want to be together etc. We were also physically intimate a few times. I know this sounds rushed but it felt right at the time. We are both in our 30s. A couple months ago I noticed he would flirt with another woman at the coffee shop at his work. After work he used to call me everyday to talk but he stopped doing that as well and wouldn’t answer when I called him. I just figured maybe he was busy. Then one day he told me the woman from the coffee shop was obsessed with him, stalked him and followed him home. I was very angry but laughed it off and said he flirts with everyone so I wasn’t surprised. He was offended by this and said it wasn’t true. Anyways, I was told by a friend that he leaves work at the EXACT same time as the woman at the coffee shop every day, which is 5 minutes earlier than his usual schedule. I want to confront him about this but don’t know if I should just let it go, and obviously I have stopped having anything to do with him anymore. He is a liar and a coward. He still tries to flirt with me, because we run into each other everyday still. ",1,1765494138.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
