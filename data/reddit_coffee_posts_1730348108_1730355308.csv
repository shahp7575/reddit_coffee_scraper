> ""The great thing about being polyamorous is that if you're not into me, you can hit up [my wife] and then just be happy. I'll be sitting drinking coffee like *hell yeah*.""

:( not jerking. i don't like it. i actually hate it. it's still bad if he's just talking about grimes, but it looks really, really bad next to him bringing up chappell roan. why did he say that? like, ally brought her up way earlier in the episode, but that was when they were talking about disrespectful fans and early collegehumor stalkers...? 

you can watch the video on anthony padilla's youtube channel for the full context, and it probably does look better with that context. it's totally possible that this is just a useless kneejerk reaction to something whatever - there's so much plausible deniability here - but it genuinely made me feel nauseous lol",0,1730354874.0,dropoutcirclejerk,0,0.33,False

During Ramadan, it’s common to prepare an abundance of food, especially for iftar gatherings. While sharing food is part of the spirit of Ramadan, being mindful of portions can help reduce food waste.

One useful strategy is to start with smaller portions. You can always go back for seconds if you’re still hungry, but starting small helps prevent waste. If you do end up with leftovers, don’t let them go to waste! Share them with neighbors or donate to those in need.

Many communities have local charities or organizations that accept food donations, particularly during Ramadan.

Composting is another way to ensure that any food scraps return to the Earth productively. Fruit and vegetable peels, coffee grounds, and even eggshells can be composted to enrich the soil in your garden or local community space. If you don’t have a compost system, check if your neighborhood or city has a compost collection service.

1gg7qlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1gg7qlb/how_do_i_23m_meet_people_for_relationships/,How do I (23M) meet people for relationships without college?,"Hear me out, I'll start off by saying that I know this might be popular question. I've looked at some of them and maybe have an idea but if you care for a long read I'll try to be specific about my situation. Although this is generally about meeting people and making connections including friendships, I think I'm currently focusing a bit more on the dating aspect.

I'm a 23-year-old guy living in SoCal. The main reason for my lack of connections is the fact that I took a very untraditional path with my education after high school. After graduating, I spent most of my time pursuing education/work online and only spent a few months in a in-person college. After getting laid off I've spent the past year grinding through an online university to get my bachelors within a year. Most if not all of my friends are people I've known online for about 6-10 years. I've never really felt lonely until I started thinking about how I've almost unintentionally been chronically online. I honestly don't think I lack the social skills to keep a conversation going, it's more about the opportunities and approaching part. I've been complimented on my looks being even better than my pictures and I like to think I'm at least average in appearance.

I've been trying to put myself out there more. I try to study outside at cafes multiple times a week; I sometimes visit random smaller events like farmers' markets and have spontaneously done stuff like finally visiting a rave/bar for the first time this past year. Problem being is none of these really lead to any socializing and it doesn't really feel natural besides stuff like chatting to sellers at booths. I've heard of the site meetup and I figured there should be a lot of events here in Cali/OC but they seem to generally be for people older than me. For some reason I also might have a weird perception of people using meetup, especially the singles/mixers events (I know I can't judge though). I also don't think I'd connect really well with people at places like bars, combining the fact that I don't like to drink.

I tell myself that dating apps are probably the solution, but I've recently learned that it's probably not for me either. My view of dating apps has been mostly skewed into it being a platform for hookups which discourages me from trying to pursue something real from it. The whole experience just feels very empty. But the thing is some of the people I've strictly met for hookups were the ones I've actually connected to the most on a personal/emotional level. I think it's because skipping all the small talk and upping the pacing of everything just lead to a deeper connection. Experiencing this is what sort of changed me from only wanting fun to wanting something serious.

I have these in mind with some following thoughts:

* Pick up a part-time job that might allow me to socialize at least a little bit (coffee shop, boba shop, trader joes, idk). This would really only be me socializing with coworkers though.
* The widely mentioned one... finding meetups or hobbies to pursue. This is honestly weirdly difficult for me. For meetups specific to the meetup website I can't find stuff that are interesting AND consist of people close to my age.
* Picking up a pottery/language/drawing/cooking class but these are all paid classes I'd have to think about. Probably would be done at a local community college.
* I'm not religious, but I also wonder if a more modern and social church is a potential opportunity too.
* Volunteering at an animal shelter, preservation garden, anything relaxing.

My friends tell me that I shouldn't stress about these things and let it come to me, but I try to think objectively and tell myself that not having natural opportunities means I need to put in some effort.

tl;dr: school, work, and friends were all online which led to the lack of in person connections. dating apps are seen as a hookup app for me. meetups related to hobbies are weirdly difficult to find and have interest in. where do I organically make nice friends and find a potential partner? my growing age and lack of social opportunities is starting to daunt over me.",2,1730354163.0,GenZ,2,1.0,False
1gg7qb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gg7qb9/one_of_many_strange_childhood_experience_that_i/,One of many strange childhood experience that I would love insight on. Am I just making this a bigger deal than it is?,"Let me start off by saying this is not the only strange or unexplained event I’ve experienced. I am currently 26, and have had bizarre encounters my whole life. This particular experience happened when I was around 7 years old. 
Me, my mom, dad, brother (1 y/o baby at the time), and grandparents all rented a room at a Colorado ski resort. It was a pretty sweet resort, and my family’s unit consisted of a living area, kitchen, and three bedrooms that were connected by a hallway. My parents and grandparents had their room, and my brother and I were sharing a room. This was the first (and last) time I went to CO or skiing (not bc of this experience, but bc it wasn’t in the cards again for us). We were booked to stay for a week (flying out on the 7th day in the afternoon), and I couldn’t have been more exited. I remember having an absolute blast trying to learn how to maneuver the slopes (even though I kinda sucked at it and had 2 speeds: too fast or laying in the snow bc I lost control and crashed lol). 
It wasn’t until the 3rd day of our trip that I started seeing a shadow figure out of the corner of my eye. I remember the first time I saw it I was coloring on the coffee table in the living area, and all my hair stood on end. I wasn’t sure why… but then I noticed the figure out of my peripheral. It was tall (seemed to be the shape of a man), all black, and appeared to be wearing a cowboy hat… but with less of a rim. Almost like a fedora or bowlers cap I guess? I saw it walking down the same hall leading to the rooms often, or peaking out from behind a wall… the weird thing is every time I looked directly at the area it was in it disappeared. I began to feel a sense of dread… something that wasn’t foreign to me as I’ve dealt with a slew of issues and challenges (at this time my OCD was terrible, and I was later professionally diagnosed as being on the Autism spectrum). The reason I bring this up is because anxiety, panic, and overstimulation were not a foreign experience for me, so it wasn’t like “a child’s first experience with anxiety” situation. The feeling I got when I saw this figure was different. I remember I actually was so scared at one point I brought it up to my mom, who said that she too sees figures in her peripheral vision, and that it was much worse when she was a kid but that all people experience this phenomenon. She said it was my imagination or my mind playing tricks on me and it wasn’t real. I trusted her… but still had a horrible feeling in my gut. 
Fast forward to day 5 of our 7 day trip, I became violently ill. Vomiting, fever, fatigue, the whole shebang. I distinctly remember the throwing up and sweating from fever being particularly bad. I rested the last full day (day 6) while my family members took turns monitoring me…and honestly don’t remember any of it. From what they told me I was either asleep, vomiting, or in a strange, semi-lucid state that they said was a result of fever. Then came day 7. We were leaving in the afternoon, and I have memories of that day (one that stands out is me running to the bathroom and vomiting in the tub lmao). I did my best to rest and get ready for the flight home… but I truly felt like I was dying. I even said maybe we could stay until I felt better bc the thought of flying was so aversive, but that wasn’t an option. We flew home (and shockingly I never once threw up on the flight), got back in the early morning hours, I went to sleep, and woke up in our home the next morning feeling SIGNIFICANTLY better. 
My family said it was altitude sickness or a 48 hour bug. If it was altitude sickness, why did it only hit me on the 5th day? I could see it being a bug or maybe the flu… but I still have that gut feeling something more was at play. None of it really made sense to me (even as a child)… but I brushed it off and moved on. It wasn’t until I began learning about the unexplained that I started to question if maybe these events were connected. What if the figure I kept seeing, that made me feel scared enough to tell my mom (which wasn’t something I normally did) had something to do with it? I don’t have the answer but I figured maybe some people on this sub might have a unique insight or perspective I haven’t thought of before.",2,1730354124.0,Thetruthishere,1,1.0,False

I actually feel like I’m dying/wasting away

My whole life I’ve thought this made me lazy. Now I don’t know what to think other than just knowing I’m having a hard time. 

Trying to figure out what to eat, how to pay for it and how to make money in general is killing me. I’m so depressed. 

But then my partner and I spent two days at my in-laws house (I love them) for a birthday celebration and I felt so totally… fine. Like Teo days after the worst depressive episode of my life. My MIL is an amazing cook and plans our meals that are tasty and healthy and fit my restricted diet. I don’t mind cleaning and I even like helping with the cooking when she is doing the planning (and the shopping lol). We went on a hike, played a board game, made food, slept in the guest bedroom. I even had enough brain space left over to start planning out some new photo shoots and art pieces (something I haven’t felt capable of thinking about in weeks)

Then I get home tonight and BAM overwhelmed, depressed, so hard to function and figure out what to eat. I want to cry I feel so sad and frustrated. It’s like all of my energy is going to these million tiny tasks that are SO HARD and don’t make me happy. 

Tomorrow I’ll have to figure out once again how to get out of bed, how to feed myself and face the question of: how to get money? (I do mostly freelance website and photography work and I’m between projects right now)

Really really relieved to be starting therapy with a ND therapist on Monday (we did a consult call 2 weeks ago and I have never felt so seen and supported by a stranger)

It’s just… so hard. Why? I hate this back and forth happy/sad weekend/workweek pattern I have going. And if I’m being honest with myself it’s getting harder to bounce out of depressed mode every weekend. 

I don’t want to continually be struggling with these small daily tasks. I want to be doing art and supporting myself and traveling and living life. I just feel so stuck right now",2,1730353957.0,AuDHDWomen,0,1.0,False

This is on the pricier side as the 16oz is Php 200. I realized if you really wanted a quality drink, you gotta pay the price (except SB).  However, recently i finally had the chance to try the one in Deuces which was also great.

Living in Fairview, QC, not much of an option for cafes here so I am definitely mourning the closure of their branch in SM North.

1gg7g7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/1gg7g7c/the_inglewood_evening_dispatch_returns/,The Inglewood Evening Dispatch RETURNS,"Dearest Cecilia,



Horror and terror are often confused. At their core they both seek to explain a transformatively negative experience. “Two sister words having their way with the letter R,” you once jested, a sweating bottle of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc in hand, half-assedly watching *Halloween* on the TV. Put generally, horror is the explicit experience of the grotesque, and terror is *the anticipation of it*. Having recently provided both to my neighborhood villains, I know the difference intimately.



It is once again fall in Tennessee. If you expected more of Inglewood, I apologize. There is yet again a transit referendum. Virtually everyone has stabbed some sort of political sign into the unsuspecting clay of their yards. These signs consist of a rickety wire frame propping up a waxy corrugated message. You used to put your cigarettes out on the ones that you didn’t like. You’d be upset with the price of cigarettes these days. 



Leopold Street has recently become the epicenter of a sign-stealing scandal. Hushed whispers abound. Mary and I suspiciously lost our pro-transit sign last week. I’ve done a bit of detective work but you know the neighborhood, Cecilia. Susan Price, in a moment of panic when questioned, gave an awkward wave and piled into her car. Susan Price’s Marsha Blackburn signs have notably remained intact. It is only a certain class of sign that seems to have gone missing. I’ll let Edith Gregory at 992 Leopold tell you what she told me:



“Wale it’s them fuckers from New Jersey. I got the Ring, ya know. Barbara Cathcart, mhmm. I seenter grab them signs at night, clear ast day. She’s all *no transit tax* and all. They haint been here what a year. And that teeny dog. Christamighty.” After declining a Miller High Life from her porch fridge, I helped Edith light her Black and Mild.  



You and I shared a profound love of Halloween. Mary and I do as well. Mary has chosen to dress as *Rumours*\-era Stevie Nicks this year. I hesitate to say it, but most of the time Mary is dressed as some permutation of *Rumours*\-era Stevie Nicks. She bought several bags of candy in the vain hope that we would somehow have trick-or-treaters this year. 



Things were not looking good by 7:45 PM. Darkness had set in. Four little kids had shown up, all in one bunch. They were rewarded handsomely. Despite the dismal turnout Mary was smiling. She takes some sort of long-term approach to emotions that I do not understand. She sees how this year’s holiday features among the great book of tales that we may or may not have the chance to tell one another. She is remarkably and admirably *of the moment*. 



Sometime after 8, in the pale light of our living room, Mary stood and approached me. Time is man’s attempt to quantize the motion of the universe. Mist was swirling despite the lack of a fog machine. Mary had *Gold Dust Woman* going on the speaker. She took my fourth high-gravity beer from my hand and put it down on the coffee table.



“Are you going to behave yourself tonight?” she asked. I legitimately did not know the correct answer to this question. Her eyes have the rare ability to damn and redeem at the same time. I stood. 



This year I’d chosen to dress as Michael Myers. I was in an old set of coveralls with an expensive mask propped up on my head. I have always related to the character, much to your chagrin, Cecilia. Mary got up on her tiptoes and kissed me. She pulled the latex mask down over my face and I reveled in the claustrophobic sounds that the breath made. 



*Hhhhnnnhhh. Hhhhnnnhhh.* 



“What are you thinking?” she asked. 



My mother always said that we are who we are when no one is looking. I fail to make a potent literary connection here, but when I had the Michael Myers mask on I was no longer Hector Fogg. I looked down at my hands and vaguely recalled dreams that I’d once had. Mary put her body against mine. 



“*Rulers make bad lovers,*” she whispered. I smelled latex.



*Hhhhnnnhhh. Hhhhnnnhhh.*



“Happy Halloween, Hector.” she said. 



*Hhhhnnnhhh. Hhhhnnnhhh.* 



The cool evening air was redeeming. The sounds of brush against the mask were unusually satisfying. I pushed my way through the hedgerows and the darkness. 



*Hhhhnnnhhh. Hhhhnnnhhh.* 



The lights of the kitchen were blazing. Barbara Cathcart was folding laundry on the kitchen table. She was in her nightgown and slippers. She gently turned a turquoise kaftan over in her hands and laid it into a pile. *What was that?*



Barbara walked over to the picture window. 



*Hhhhnnnhhh. Hhhhnnnhhh.* 



She turned to her Indonesian teak-wood bureau and retrieved her reading glasses. She stuffed them onto her face and looked out the window. The hedgerow was empty, limp leaves gently waving in the cool autumn air. She crossed her arms and retreated to the pile of laundry. She picked up her glass of Chablis and grimaced at the temperature. The delicates were always such a pain in the ass. She put the glass down and dug into the warm pile. 



*Marty Brodeur,* her aging Yorkshire Terrier, let out a single yip. Through the front window she could only see the reflection of interior lights. The dog minced its paws on the couch and gestured outside. Barbara gulped down the cheap Chablis and put the glass down on her great aunt’s antique davenport. She approached the window and tried to make sense of the terror before her.



*Hhhhnnnhhh. Hhhhnnnhhh.* 



“Joe? Joe!” she called out. Marty Brodeur licked his lips and retreated to his cage. 



Joe Cathcart did not respond. He was upstairs working on his novel and listening to Paul Simon’s *Graceland* through expensive headphones. It would only be Barbara and the stock-still maniac on her front lawn. It would only be Barbara and I. 



*Hhhhnnnhhh. Hhhhnnnhhh.* 



I could see her scream at me behind the glass. I couldn’t hear anything. Her eyes were bugging out in horror. So were mine. She unlocked the door and ran out the porch. 



“No! NO! YOU MANIAC!” she screamed. 



I reached behind me and found metal. I pointed at Barbara and raised the spear above my head. I took a deep breath and plunged the disgusting, evil, forbidden thing into the heart of her front yard:



VOTE FOR NASHVILLE, VOTE FOR TRANSIT



Barbara clutched her collar and sank to the ground, screaming, losing her mind, writhing under the light of a crescent moon. 



*Hhhhnnnhhh. Hhhhnnnhhh.* 



Happy Halloween, Cecilia. 



Yours,

Hector Fogg

1gg7g2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1gg7g2l/choosing_the_perfect_coffee_table_for_your_home/,Choosing the Perfect Coffee Table for Your Home Decor Style,"When it comes to designing a living space, the coffee table is often the anchor of the room, offering both functionality and style. The right coffee table can tie together your decor, provide a focal point, and create balance in your space. But with so many options out there [rattan coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/ava-rattan-coffee-table), [black coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/lucas-black-coffee-table), [metal table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables) it can be challenging to find the perfect fit for your unique home decor style. Here’s a guide to help you choose the best coffee table for your space, no matter your aesthetic preference.

**1. Understand Your Decor Style**

The first step to choosing the ideal coffee table is understanding the existing decor style in your home. Whether your style is modern, bohemian, industrial, or minimalist, knowing your aesthetic will help narrow down your coffee table choices.

**Modern and Minimalist:** Sleek, simple, and functional coffee tables work best for modern decor. Look for tables with clean lines and minimal ornamentation.

**Bohemian and Eclectic:** Embrace rattan coffee tables or those made from natural materials, which add warmth and an earthy touch.

**Industrial and Contemporary:** Metal tables with a raw finish or sleek black coffee tables bring an edge and sophistication, perfect for a contemporary home.

**2. Consider the Material**

The material of your coffee table can set the tone for the room. Each material offers a different texture, color, and durability level, impacting the ambiance and functionality of your space.

**Rattan Coffee Table:** If you’re looking to bring a natural, airy feel to your living room, a rattan coffee table is an excellent choice. This style fits beautifully in boho and coastal interiors, adding warmth and texture without overwhelming the space.

**Black Coffee Table:** A black coffee table is ideal if you’re aiming for a bold statement or a modern, sleek look. This versatile color pairs effortlessly with almost any decor style, making it a timeless option. It’s also great for hiding minor scuffs or stains.

**Metal Table:** For an industrial or modern edge, consider a metal table. These are highly durable and offer a contemporary look, especially in minimalist or loft-style spaces. A metal table can also work as a great contrast piece in rooms that feature a lot of wood or fabric.

**3. Shape Matters: Rectangular, Round, or Square?**

The shape of your coffee table can impact the flow and functionality of your space. Here’s a quick breakdown:

**Rectangular Tables:** Ideal for longer seating arrangements like sectional sofas, as they provide plenty of surface area for drinks, books, and decor.

**Round Tables:** Perfect for creating an inviting, cozy feel and work well in smaller spaces or alongside sofas with curved lines.

**Square Tables:** Square coffee tables can add symmetry to your space and offer a balanced, modern look. However, they require more floor space, so they’re better suited for larger living rooms.

**4. Size and Scale**

It’s essential to choose a coffee table that complements the scale of your furniture and space. Here are a few rules of thumb:

**Height:** The coffee table should be about the same height as the seat of your sofa, usually around 16-18 inches for standard seating.

**Length:** Aim for a table that’s approximately two-thirds the length of your sofa.

**Distance:** Allow at least 18 inches between the coffee table and surrounding seating to ensure easy movement and access.

**5. Functionality: Storage or No Storage?**

Consider how you’ll use your coffee table. Do you need a place to store books, remote controls, or children’s toys? Coffee tables with built-in storage solutions or lower shelves can help keep your space organized without sacrificing style.

**Rattan Coffee Tables with Shelving:** These offer a stylish way to integrate storage, blending functionality with a light, airy feel.

**Metal Tables with Drawers or Trays:** Industrial-style tables often come with handy storage solutions, perfect for hiding clutter.

**6. Balancing Your Coffee Table with Decor**

Once you’ve chosen the perfect coffee table, consider how you’ll decorate it. Style it with a few well-chosen accessories that enhance the table’s material and color. A black coffee table, for instance, can be softened with a rattan tray or a few ceramic vases for contrast. For rattan coffee tables, consider adding a small potted plant or a stack of books to highlight the natural texture.

**7. Popular Coffee Table Styles for Different Decors**

Let’s look at popular coffee table choices for various decor themes:

**Scandinavian:** Look for simple, light wood tables with a natural finish. Rattan coffee tables also fit well in Scandi-inspired spaces, adding warmth without detracting from the simplicity.

**Modern Glam:** Black coffee tables with gold or brass accents work well in glam interiors, adding a touch of luxury.

**Boho Chic:** Rattan and woven coffee tables bring boho rooms to life, adding a relaxed, artisanal vibe.

**Industrial:** A metal table, whether finished in black, bronze, or silver, fits perfectly in an industrial setting, adding both edge and durability.

**Final Thoughts**

Choosing the right coffee table can make all the difference in creating a cohesive, inviting space. Whether you’re drawn to the earthy appeal of a rattan coffee table, the bold statement of a black coffee table, or the sleek durability of a metal table, there’s a perfect piece out there to complete your room. By considering your decor style, material preferences, shape, and functionality, you can confidently select a coffee table that not only complements your space but also enhances your day-to-day living experience.",1,1730352863.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

I was naturally really nervous and so a little awkward, the conversation didn’t flow totally naturally but I’m willing to accept that as a part of having never met him before.

We had coffee, then went and got sushi, and then we went back to his place and had some wine. We didn’t talk much or have a super long conversation because I’m so awkward and didn’t know what to say, but we started cuddling and even kissing. He wanted to be little spoon the whole time and I was a bit like uh ohh cause usually I prefer to be the bottom or submissive one, but I didn’t mind it actually and we did take turns every so often. 

This is where I fear something is up. He is SO attractive and sweet and his kisses would be heartbreaking for anyone except me it seems, because the whole time I struggled to feel anything passionate or happy. I just felt like I was kissing flesh. I am attracted to him 100%; maybe it’s my anxiety that’s blocking me from these feelings?? 

I feel like a broken robot lol. I thought I was ready to start exploring physical and emotional relationships after a longgg period of struggling with my mental health but maybe I’m wrong?

1gg7aek,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1gg7aek/narcissistic_mom_or_am_i_the_problem/,Narcissistic mom? or am I the problem? ,"

I, 26(F) have been struggling a lot with my mom. My mom has always been controlling and mean towards me, my sister and my sister who passed away. But my brother? My mom puts him on such a high pedestal. He can do no wrong. Everything he does, is just perfect. And it seems like Everytime me or my sisters did anything, our mom would just put us down in some way. For a few years, my brother had cut all contact with my mom because of her behavior (she was upset that my brother wanted to name is son after my dad. My mom and dad have been divorced since 2016 and my dad passed away in 2018 from cancer). And during that time, things with my mom had gotten a little easier. We only had one falling out to where I had to block her because she wanted me to put my newborn daughter in an expired carseat (she was mad because I had spent money on a car seat I wanted for my daughter and didn't want to use my old expired one or one she bought for me at a thrift store). But ever since last year, when they started getting along again, it feels like every single thing I'm doing in my life is either wrong or she disproves of. Here are some examples; 

1. She complains EVERY SINGLE time I go out and buy something for my kids. Either it be clothes, shoes, toys, whatever, she gets mad. She tells me I can go to the thrift store and buy them something or she can buy them something. She even got mad at me once because I bought my kids Christmas presents. 

2. I have mental health, and physical health problems. So sometimes, I don't have the energy to do everything in a day. Sometimes my physical condition sucks out all my energy and I'm physically sick and mentally drained. So some days, all I have energy for is to make sure my kids are good, fed, bathed, let them play outside for a little bit and tuck them in. She will let herself in, and yells at me because the laundry isn't done, there are toys on the floor, the dishes aren't cleaned. 

3. She brings junk over all the time. Like stuff I do not need or use. I have so many dressers in my house. So many misc. Items she brings over. Over the years it's starting to pile up. And every single time I throw them away she goes through my trash and brings it back inside! I've told her to stop that I'm already overwhelmed with everything in my house I don't need all this junk she brings over. And it's like talking to a brick wall! My mom is remarried and even my step dad told her to stop, because she has her garage filled with stuff she doesn't use and brings stuff over to me. 

4. My mom owns my house. I had gotten myself into a really hard situation and my mom helped me out by buying a house for me and my husband and kids to stay in. At first it was great. Everything was wonderful. And I was so grateful, and I still am. Over the last 2 years, my mom unannounced comes into my house, takes my things, and my kids things, like my kids clothes and shoes, and keeps them. She will come in and move around everything. Throw things away that my family and I use. And just complain the whole time about everything. I tell her to stop doing it because it makes me extremely mad. It's not because I don't appreciate the help, it's just when things aren't where they belong, it really makes me upset. And so I have to spend the rest of the day putting things back to where they were. 

5. Everytime I dye my hair, my mom always has to make mean comments, saying how ""stupid"" I look or I look terrible. 

6. Everytime I go out and do something for myself, like, get me a coffee or go shopping for myself, it's nothing but lectures. I am a stay at home mom, so getting coffee and just going out is a treat for me. I do not buy something for myself every pay check, just every once in a while. Before, I used to really enjoy doing that. It boosted my mood. But now, it makes me feel awful because of what she says to me. 

7. Everytime I go out and do something with my kids, she tells me how I'm just wasting money. 



And my newest problem;

My pets. My mom HATES animals. We do not have any contacts that says I can't have pets, but I NEED my pets. I have 3 dogs, all under 25 pounds. My smallest weights 6 pounds. My biggest weighs about 19 pounds. And I have 4 cats. Two cats are inside cats and my boy cats are outside cats. My animals are trained to help me with my physical health. They are trained to help during panic attacks and they are trained to deal with my mental health episodes. I do not have mental health episodes unless my medical condition is acting up, which really affects me a lot. I clean up after my animals. They are all cleaned, bathed, theyve all been to the vet. My cats are not ESAs, but my dogs are. I have a doctor's note for them. I haven't gotten anything for my cats because, they are cats and they are newest to the family. Anytime my mom is over, she stomps at them. Yells at them. Tries to kick them.  And it makes my dogs super aggressive. They do not like her at all. Over the past month, my neighbor abandoned their cat. They would not come back and take her. And I felt so bad for her. She would just meow at their door. She left no food, water or safe space for her. My boys saw her and decided to try and tame her, which they did. We noticed that most of the neighborhood cats were attacking her so I brought her inside and put her upstairs, since no one is up there. Well, my mom came over today, and started screaming at her and stomping at her!! She told me if I don't have that cat gone in 3 days she's kicking us out..... 

It has been a NIGHTMARE. It feels like I'm not an adult. I have to walk on eggshells every single day. I feel trapped. Depressed. I feel like I don't have any options in my life anymore. I cannot live my life, without my mom always complaining or putting me down.... 

When I was younger, she was exactly like this too, but since I was a kid, I just felt like it was just part of it. She would always tell me not to ""hang around people"" that didn't have nice clothes or money. She would tell me that no one will like me because I wore sweatpants to school or pajamas. Anytime I would wear make up, she would say I looked like a clown.... Just stuff like that... 

Part of me feels bad for bringing in animals, but growing up, having an animal was the only good thing in my life. I would spend most of my time in my room with my dog, while my parents were either fighting with each other or one of my siblings. I grew very dependent on animals at a young age. My sister and I were both adopted when we were little, and that's where I was diagnosed with depression at age 2. I love animals. And it's hurting me so bad where I have to cut them out of my life just so my mom doesn't kick me out. Her words and her actions are hurting me so much.... I wish she would actually listen when I tell her that. But it's some how always my fault. 

My sister is the same exact way. She's got 5 dogs and 2 cats. She has 2 beautiful kids and a beautiful home. When my mom went to visit her this year, she would t even go inside. My sister lives 8 hours away from us. They saw her for an hour and left. And my sister is hurt by that too. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I'm the problem. If I'm being disrespectful. I don't know. All I know is that my heart is hurting. I'm so upset. 

Thanks for listening to me vent.

And in passing she has mentioned how my gf is very lucky to have me and she'll hangout after work in the parking lot with me for an hour just chatting for no reason. And she has called me cute multiple times and I have done the same (my gf knows all of this). My only issue is that I have the urge to tell her in private that I have a massive crush on her and that I can't stop thinking of her. I really just want to know if she feels the same. But I also am conflicted because I am afraid that if she does feel the same that these feelings could become stronger and I don't know how I may act (I wouldn't cheat but I just don't know how that would affect me). I'm thinking I should just ignore it but I will likely know her for a very long time and it will eat away at me being in the unknown. Other aspect to this is she is moving to another branch in 2 days. So I have that much time to tell her person basically if I don't want to invite her to speak over a cup of coffee. And I'm thinking of just texting her and telling her but I think that's a terrible idea.... Any advice for a committed man with big eyes and a big heart?

1gg73b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1gg73b9/do_not_play_the_ouija_board/,Do not play the Ouija board ,"For some context this happened when I was in high school and was more prone to foolish suggestions. I will never be anywhere near that board again and do not recommend anyone else “play” with it. 

It was supposed to be a casual night. We were happy to be done with school for a while and enjoy summer vacation.  Around midnight, someone mentioned the Ouija board.

“Nah,” I said, shaking my head. I’d heard enough stories to know it’s not something you mess with. But they kept pushing, joking that I was too scared. I laughed it off, but in the back of my mind, a faint unease prickled. It felt like something I shouldn’t do, like crossing some invisible line. But eventually, I caved, part of me also excited. 

We set the board on the coffee table and dimmed the lights, half for effect and half because we thought it was all just a game. We settled around the board, fingers on the planchette, exchanging nervous glances. I could feel that same prickling sense of caution, but I ignored it. It’s just a board game, I told myself.

“Is anyone here?” my friend asked, her voice low, almost mocking.

Nothing happened at first. We all looked at each other, grinning. But then, just as we were about to give up, the planchette slid, slow and steady, toward YES. We froze, half-expecting someone to laugh and admit they were pushing it, but no one did.

“So… what’s your name?” my friend asked, trying to keep up the joking tone, but I could hear the edge in her voice. The planchette didn’t move this time, just stayed still as if waiting.

After a long silence, I asked, “Do you want us here?” I don’t know why I asked that—it just slipped out, and as soon as I said it, I wished I hadn’t.

Slowly, the planchette slid to N-O.

A chill settled over the room, the kind that feels like it’s creeping in from some deep, cold place. One of my friends laughed nervously, saying it was probably just a joke or one of us messing around. But nobody looked convinced anymore.

I suggested we stop, but someone else brushed it off, saying we were almost done. So we kept going, feeling a little braver again, asking questions and joking around. But the atmosphere stayed heavy, like the room was closing in on us.

“Alright,” I finally said, ready to end it. “Do you want us to leave?”

The planchette shot to YES so quickly it made us all jump. We all pulled our hands back, laughing nervously. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off, that maybe we’d done something we shouldn’t have.

As we started cleaning up, we noticed that one of the candles had gone out without us noticing, and the air felt colder than it had before. We laughed it off, but the jokes fell flat, and when I looked into my friend’s faces, I could see that they felt it too—that sense of wrongness hanging over us, silent and heavy.

The weirdest part? For weeks after that night, I kept feeling like I was being watched. I’d catch myself glancing over my shoulder, seeing shadows that didn’t quite make sense. It was probably nothing, I told myself. Just my mind playing tricks.

But deep down, I knew something had shifted that night, like a door we couldn’t see had opened, and something—or someone—had been watching, waiting. And maybe, just maybe, it was still there, lingering on the edge of the light.",5,1730351446.0,Paranormal,4,0.86,False

1gg70r5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1gg70r5/first_time_getting_dumped/,First time getting dumped,"So I’ve been seeing this guy for a little while, over a month now. To put things into perspective, I’ll first explain how things were going with us. It was good, the first time we hung out I was super unsure about him- really just thought he’d be a friend. Then, we went and got coffee and hung out at his place, and we just clicked. I thought he was the cutest guy ever, and it was just so nice being around him. He always paid for me, and took me out to dinner- something I don’t get from guys often. We had agreed to keep things casual, really just seeing it go from there, but with no expectations or anything. 

Well, after a while of that, we had a long talk about moving things further- note this was relatively recently. I told him I wanted at least another month before actually being in a relationship, but we discussed how we were both really liking each other and wanted something more. It was very validating to me because he was very vocal about wanting something with me, and just was saying how he’d do whatever I wanted with this but that he could see himself being with me- and didn’t see any issue since we were already exclusively seeing each other. So, this just made develop feelings. I really liked him. Now, here’s where things get tricky. 
 
It started off as me getting upset with him for the first time, I had come over to spend the night and he went to do some quick laundry when I got there, but ended up in the kitchen with his roomates (and coincidentally three other girls his roomates had brought over) for half an hour. I was very upset, but he was very apologetic and explained how he just got wrapped up in talking to everyone since it had been while since everyone was over at once like that. He got like red eyed and just looked very worried, and even told me he was worried he upset me and was concerned about this changing something between us since I hadn’t gotten mad at him before. We got past it, I still spent the night and things were okay- I definitely could’ve been more civil about it and I realize I have a tendency to just be bitchy but we’ll get to that.

Then it the next night and he was out with friends, and he started leaving me on read and when I got upset and told him he quickly said he’s in the hospital and will tell me tomorrow. (Long story, wrestling like a dumbass with friends and got a concussion). I was upset, rightfully I think bc I was worried, but we got past it and I went over and brought him snacks and drinks. Then it just progressed into not seeing each other , and he just felt so distant. Last time I saw him was two days ago, and it was weird because we fucked then he was just on his phone after wards- I had noticed he was texting some girl I had noticed a few times before- and it was just a whole thing. I got upset, kinda just turned over and didn’t rlly speak. Was weird. Then, don’t see him, he makes no advances to see me, despite him leaving for a trip the 31st. I asked him today if I would see him before he left, and it was a bunch of maybies. 

Now, the big part. 

I pretty much just went for it, he said he was sorry bc he knew I was upset about not seeing him again, and I just dived in and explained how I was feeling. It became a long conversation. His main side was that he has been stressed and trying to juggle school, sports, me, and now a concussion. I completely understood, I really just wanted the validation that he still liked me and that we had something. I brought up the idea of stepping back so he could deal with things, not really expecting him to go along with it, but he totally did. He was just yeah, but I don’t wanna be on bad terms, maybe we could be friends still. Thus, we are no longer seeing each other. 

I don’t know what to do. It feels like I was dumped because he just seemed like he had wanted to end things but didn’t want to bring it up. Like a slow burn end, and it just really hurt. I’ve only ever broken up with someone, so this was the first time I’ve dealt with wow they no longer like me. It absolutely sucks. I really liked this guy. Like, I just keep thinking about what I did and what I could’ve changed to make things better. I don’t know, we haven’t talked since early today and I feel like texting him to just apologize more. Idk if I should. Fuck man

For the most part, I've been good about being gluten free, no cross-contamination, etc. These past few months, I've messed up a bit because I'm living in a new country with few GF options and have had to adjust to the fact that basically nothing is safe but fresh ingredients. I've started cooking everything myself, which is a bummer but fine.

My issue is that no matter what, I still feel sick and it's gotten worse these past couple weeks. I've even cut out coffee this week to see if that's the problem which sucks because going to cafes and getting a simple latte has been the only ""treat"" I can have with this disease. 

Here's what I've eaten for the past three days: eggs, Smithfield sliced deli ham (no flavoring, not smoked), bell peppers, onions, white rice, rice cakes (GF), salmon, avocados, banana, watermelon, honeydew, cantaloupe. I also drink Coke Zero, and use salt/pepper/garlic. No oats, special seasoning, flavorings, or anything like that. I cook everything myself, with my own utensils.

Still, I'm having intestinal pain, bloating after every ""meal,"" fatigue, brain fog, etc. What am I doing wrong??? 

I don't like complaining about this disease and I really never have, but now I'm honestly getting so exhausted. I feel like I'm doing everything ""right,"" but it's not enough.

I’m a big fan of kopi c kosong at a good Toast Box with kopista (barista for local coffee). It always confound me that the standard of kopi c ko song varies depending where I go. It frustrates me when the kopi c is not as good.

My friend suggests that Toast Box uses Arabica and Robusta - is that true?

My observation for the good kopista that does differently and variables in good kopi c: 

1. Brew fresh with old 
2. pulls the kopi a couple more times
3. Puts Right amount of c 
4. Tops right amount of hot water to dilute

1gg6q49,https://www.reddit.com/r/springfieldMO/comments/1gg6q49/i_did_it/,I did it. ,"It was a dreary Tuesday morning, and the office was buzzing with the kind of tension that makes you reconsider your life choices. My boss, Kris Rustmann, was pacing the floor like a lion ready to pounce on the next hapless employee who dared to breathe too loudly. As I sat at my desk, nursing my third cup of coffee, I felt an all-too-familiar pressure building in my bladder.

""Just hold it together,"" I whispered to myself, imagining my dignity evaporating into thin air. The clock ticked ominously, each second dragging on as Kris launched into yet another rambling tirade about the ""importance of synergy."" I squirmed in my seat, desperately trying to focus on the PowerPoint presentation in front of me, but the pressure was relentless.

Suddenly, the fire alarm blared. Panic erupted in the office, and everyone scrambled for the exits. In the chaos, I felt a moment of relief—this was my chance! I bolted toward the restroom, dodging flailing arms and flying paperclips. But just as I reached the door, I heard Kris’s booming voice behind me, “We’re not done yet! Everyone back to your seats!”

It was like a scene from a horror movie, my heart racing as I stood frozen. The bathroom was so close, yet I could feel my control slipping away. I glanced back at Kris, who had transformed into a terrifying specter, his eyes wild with authority. I took a deep breath and dashed for the bathroom, but as I reached for the handle, disaster struck.

In that moment of sheer terror, I lost the battle. Time slowed as I felt the warm wave of humiliation wash over me, an unstoppable tide of shame. “No, no, no!” I thought, but it was too late. The unmistakable sound of liquid splattering echoed in the small bathroom, and I knew I was done for.

When I finally emerged, the office was eerily silent, and all eyes turned to me, the now-infamous ""Pee Pants Person."" Kris’s mouth dropped open in disbelief, and I could see the horror—and maybe a hint of amusement—on his face. My coworkers erupted into laughter, and I felt my cheeks burn hotter than the fire alarm that had initially set off this chain of events.

As I slunk back to my desk, I realized that from that day on, I would forever be known as the employee who made a splash in the most unexpected way. The terror of the moment was now mixed with the absurdity of my situation, and I couldn't help but chuckle through my embarrassment. Who knew that in the world of corporate horror stories, I would become the punchline?

The first one was when the safe space was J.CO donuts and coffee (a donut chain from Indonesia) and when Pony mentioned to Carl that there are Crawlers in Indonesia.

My home country is 3rd world country rife with corruption, nepotism and religious extremism that it was largely forgotten by the world, so it was a great surprise to see it mentioned in this book!

Go out on a walk. Go get lunch. Visit them for tea and coffee.

Explain to your parents your voting decisions and (in a loving, kind way) ask them to vote with you. Share with them how this election is very important to you. And how you need them and their help. 

Pennsylvania has many large communities whose older generations veer conservative. They might only listen to their gut or weird conspiracy YouTube channels (I have a relative like that). Modern day individualism only makes this worse. They might not listen to Harris, the news, a celebrity endorsement or someone like Esper or Kelly. 

But they might listen to you. They might listen to concerns of their Medicare being taken away or tariffs driving up the cost of food products you (their child) need. If your heart is in the right place, if you love your parents and truly want what is best for them, you can get through to people. 

The thing is that people now more than ever are afraid and lonely. Trump targets these kinds of individuals with his rhetoric. He targets people who are depressed, who feel powerless. Whose life situations may not be great. Everyone is fighting their own battles. And people want to feel needed and he provides ‘direction’ to fool people into giving him their support. 

He pretends to be a strongman. But you’re stronger. He is still a stranger. You’re still their child even if you’re 50 and they’re 75. 

A little empathy and kindness can go a long way. This election can be won not with abhorrence but with genuine love and care.

So please, take an hour or two to spend time with a relative or loved one. You might make a world of difference. And at the very minimum, you’ve at least made someone’s day.",25,1730349303.0,Pennsylvania,26,0.71,False

It was clear on my post and from the start of our conversation na SFW and just someone to hangout with lang hanap ko since I've been attending class sa BGC that time. 

Nag meet kami and had a great conversation like all the things you can share with a stranger like random funny and even the epic stories. We clicked after having coffee naging comfy na kami agad. Then after that he was nice to offer me a ride going back home. Nag usap pa kami after that and even planned to meet up again, naka set na yung date and time kelan kami magkikita bigla syang nag cancel because of work meeting na late na natapos. 

Out of nowhere he confessed that he wanted to ask me if i'm down for momol when we were in the car daw. Sabi ko saan galing yung thoughts niya na yun eh ang linaw na sinabi kong i'm not looking for anything nsfw or what. I just want some company. So i told him na i'm not interested and not into that. He told me na he likes me coz i'm cute daw (like inuuto niya ako iniisip nya na baka pumayag ako lol). Then after i rejected his attempt of us making out he suddenly vanished and ghosted me. Hindi na siya nag reply 😂 I didn't took it personally hinayaan ko na lang kasi baka yun talaga hinahanap niya eh. 

This week lang nag post ako ulit just for chat kasi bored ako. Nag reply siya using different account, but when I read his description, work, location and saw his tg then confirmed IT WAS HIM. So i told him na i'll pass kasi kilala ko na siya, long story short hindi daw niya ako maalala and sorry daw if ganun ginawa niya. Mukhang madami-dami na siyang ghinost para hindi niya maalala.

Wala akong expectations sa mga nakikilala or nakakausap ko here but i don't get it bakit hindi nila maintindihan or hindi nila nirerespect kapag sinabing sfw yung hanap and reason ng meet up is just to have some company ipipilit pa yung gusto nila.

Is living implied, or giving birth.  I always felt I had a wonderful childhood.  I had no worries, no sad moments, no loosing thoughts, no sadness.  Yet what I didnt know was, all those feelings would soon come to pass later in life.  But not by my choice, by choices of others to me.  Funny thing is, it began before I even had a thought.  I was helping my mother one day getting ready for a garage sale.  She asked me to come over to help her, I only lived minutes away.  So I was like sure, no problem.  We sat on the floor, folding clothes and making a pile of a keep and sale.  All the while just talking about all kinds of things.  Not sure how the conversation became, but she told me a story.  A story, that till this day, repeats in my head over and over, like a record on repeat.  She told me one day, she was nine months pregnant with me in her stomache.  She said my dad was on the couch passed out, and my little sister only two years old was in the crib asleep.  She needed milk, eggs, flour and other stuff for the morning.  She sighed and told herself its up to her now.  So she put her shoes on, grabbed her purse and was on the way.  She looked at her stomache with me inside saying, ""I didnt even want you, I only got pregnant to bring  your dad home"".  You see my dad was in Vietnam at the time, he came home and during his RR my sister was concieved.  My mom told the Army she was pregnant to let my dad come home, they said nope.  Only if you have two kids will we let him come home.  So she did, only not from my dad but an old boyfriend.  But my dad didnt have to know, well when she got pregnant, my dad was coming home anyways.  You see while in the field, his humve was hit with an IUD. And his leg was no longer good enough to stay in the field.  So they purple hearted him back home.  Now here she was stuck with a nine month baby, who didnt even belong to my dad.  So looking down a flight of stairs, while going to the store that late night.  She decided you know what, and made herself fall down the stairs.  She looked at me and said, ""but here you are"".  You can imagine, how I felt.  Not only, was I not my dads blood, but my own mother tried to kill me in her womb.  It all made sense now.  All the years growing up, they always treated me different.  My sister they treated like a queen.  But me, I got treated like a dog begging for love.  But I was young at the time, I didnt know why, just was odd to me.  It made sense why, when my moms brother sexualy assulated me at age 6, I figured if she let him. It must be ok, being six, how did I know what was happening to me was wrong.  All the years growing up, who would have thought, that your own mother would see you as meaningless.  And after I grew up, you would think things would get better.  But no they didnt.  I have my own children now, and my mom and sister dont even treat my kids as family.  During Christmas times, every year, she would buy my brothers step kids all the toys in the world.  And my kids would get socks, underwear and a sweater, every year.  Like clock work, never toys or anything fun.  To the point where my kids, wouldnt even open the gifts anymore.  They were like what for, we already know what it is.  Life was hard on us.  Me and my two kids, my husband was no better.  He was a drunk, who loved hanging out with his buddies, love the stripclubs and loved treating me and the kids like we were just a burden to him.  I remember one day, we were at Chilis and me and the kids were laughing and just having a good time.  My husband was sitting there staring out the window.  With his relaxed look on his face, just mad looking.  I turned to him and asked him, why dont  you join in with us, with a smile on my face.  He turned and looked at us and said ""what do you want me to say, I have nothing in commom with what yah are talking about"".  The look on my kids face, I will never forget it.  The smiles quickly fell and the life in their eyes faded.  Just the words were so hurtful to them.  Even the table next to us, the husband looked at my husband as if he wanted to give him a peace of his mind.  I looked at my kids and tried so hard to get them to engage again.  But they were done.  I understood, so we paid and went home.  I remember when we got home, we were walking into the apt, and I told my husband to hold back for a minute.  Told my kids we will be in, in a minute.  I then turned to my husband and said ""if you ever do that again, it WILL be your last"". If you hate being with us so bad, there is the door buddy.  No one is keeping you here, NO ONE.  Not me, not the kids, no one.  So go, go to your friends, your whores, and your booze.  Well fast forward two years, and he dies of a heart attack.  Now for sure its only me and my kids.  Life is cruel, my family, what family.  I dont have one, his family, what family, they never accepted us.  This whole big world, and seems so big for three people.  But I didnt give up, God put me here for a reason.  My kids.  I want to see them live life.  I want to see them get married.  Have a family.  I want to be a grandmother some day and give them all the presents in the world.  All the love in the world, just give give give.  Something me and my kids didnt have.  But yet, we are ok.  Does it hurt, of course it does, will it stop me, of course it wont.  I am now working to better my business.  I am now a Financial Consultant.  I have come a long way, but I am also teaching my kids as well.  I want them to grow up, never worrying about money ever again.  I want their kids to know only a good life.  To know, family is love and caring.  History is not doomed to repeat, if you can change fate.  I intend to do just that, change. Well just wanted to tell my story, for anyone who wanted to listen.  Just know, dont get mad when your kids make a mess, it can be cleaned up, dont get mad when  you spill your coffee on your clothes, it can be wiped off, dont get mad when you get pulled over, you were going too fast, and most of all, dont hate your family. Dont let the light in their eyes go from LIGHT to DARK.  Sometimes if you go Dark, you might not find your way back.  Just saying. ",1,1730348897.0,u_Skorned2019,0,1.0,False

I’m breaking it off for a variety of reasons: he doesn’t respect my boundaries, is constantly sexualizing me, he is apathetic and rude towards everyone but me, expects me to dedicate all my time to him (I’m a full time student in a rigorous program working 2 jobs and volunteering) and our fundamental values just don’t line up. Overall, we’re just not the right fit for each other and I feel uncomfortable around him.

I say all this to explain the reasoning behind my plan—and my need for input to improve it to make it as comfortable for him, while still maintaining my boundaries

Usually I go to his house on the weekends, but I don’t want to this time. His family are always home and I don’t want it to be awkward. 

My dad also lives in his town so I was planning on staying with my dad for the weekend, and meeting my bf on Sunday. I was thinking we would go get coffee and sit in his car to discuss because that’s really the only place we’d have privacy. Doing it at my dad’s house unfortunately is not an option, and I don’t want to make him come all the way to my place 2 hours away just to be broken up with because that feels cruel. 

Afterwards, I will take an Uber back to my dad’s place because I feel it would be rubbing salt in the wound to make him drive me back.

What I need to know is if this is a decent breakup plan? This is my first relationship and even though I’m ending it and know he will be hurt, I don’t want to cause unnecessary pain. Please give me your thoughts and advice regarding the manner!

I’ll be honest, I have absolutely no idea how to do online dating. But me (m21) and this one girl (f20) matched and I got her number through hinge (basically, we had a convo about tv shows and I said sum like “I have a list of what shows I need to watch but it’s too long for hinge”, and it kinda just lead into me getting her number. She said it was smooth, I’m lowkey kinda proud of it)

I got her number, and I had made a joke about getting her email as well and I opened with “lowkey thought u were gonna send ur email”, to which she responded with “damn u thought I was all business”, where I replied with “nah I thought it would be funny for me to email u the list”. 

I texted her the list and she never got back to me. To be fair it’s a damn long list

However, I saw her hinge profile had a complete makeover and it kinda made me wonder if I had blew my shot, or if its completely unrelated to anything I did

It’s hinge, it ain’t serious. I was wondering if tmrw morning/afternoon I should just text her something like “ur right, that’s a lot. Maybe we should just grab coffee Friday and discuss my list in excruciating detail” or something. This is more so me asking about how to proceed in asking a girl out and actually getting a date with a girl online, since I’ve not gotten this far

And TBF I’m totally cool with rejection and if she ghosts me, and a long delay in response makes a lot of sense considering I am a stranger. So it really does depend on how I can proceed if by like tmrw afternoon I get nothing.

These people come in and one of them is asking about a sandwich we have. She has a million and one questions about this sandwich which ultimately leads to her asking me if I have a picture of the sandwich? No. I don’t have a pic of it in case you were wondering. Also btw our one sandwich is one of the two cheapest things we have on the menu (that and a burger), meant for happy hour, we are an upscale steakhouse where the average entree is ~$45. She then asked for hot water w lemon and once brought to her says the water is “too hot.” 1. It’s not, it comes from our coffee tap, which is temp controlled so we can brew tea 2. If you wait just a minute. It might cool to your ~preferred temperature~ 3. If it’s really truly too hot you have water in front of you to cool it the fuck down. 

The best and worst of all of this group was this guy who ended up with cheese on his burger. He sent it back— okay fine, tbf the guy did specify no cheese and my other bartender ignored forgot to memo it. We sent down the next burger (w a 7min ticket time from refire to landing) and he was incredulous. He declared he would not be paying for this burger. He “would not be paying for this burger.” The rest of the people are still fucking eating their food and on top of this you’re sitting at a fkn bar bro chill out. 

Got the manager, she was busy in the beer cage so I had to frontman it and let him know we would be taking care of his gd burger and lo n behold that wasn’t good enough so he makes me drag our manager over to him so he can yell at her. 

Tipped nothing (obviously)

The whole time they’re all paying with company credit cards so nothing they’re buying is coming from their own pockets. 

Anyways… long story short customers are brain dead. Nothing you don’t already know. And fuck these guys I wish I worked someplace where telling them they’re awful was more appropriate than a “fine dining” ass steak house.
