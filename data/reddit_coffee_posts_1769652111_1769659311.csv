So i am coffee lover and it's afternoon and my board exam coming and I am studying. 

I wanted coffee. 
So i gone to make coffee but I couldn't find the milk because my mom hid it because of stray cats. 

Then I found it and i reached for it and then saw a cockroach and i screamed and then milk spilled 🥲😭. 

Now kitchen looked like crime scene. I got scared and mummy will murder me. 

But Thanks to God that no one was at home. I immediately cleaned the crime scene and until no evidence left. 

I gone to shop and bought milk and put it before mummy comes. 

Did something similar happened to you all?

I work at a great district and love my job and coworkers. Two of those coworkers (“Ali” 30f and “Dave”32m) and I are pretty close as we all started within a year of each other and came on during Covid times. All three of us are married to non-teachers. We’ve had happy hours and even a couple dinners all together with our partners.

These two make some sexually suggestive jokes and comments here and there. It’s never near students, but just when it’s the three of us or a few othercoworkers. I laugh when they’re funny, but I don’t generally engage with this because I just really try to keep things overly professional. 

Despite what they may think, I’m no prude, as my wife and I actually used to engage in some swinging but it wasn’t for us, and we keep our kinky side monogamous.

Both of the coworkers complain about their spouses a normal amount, but it’s definitely increased in the year or so. Right before winter break, we did a happy hour after school and the two of them were pretty adamant about not inviting spouses.

I met them for one drink just to say happy holidays, but they had arrived earlier than me and seemed to be prepared to stay later. I didn’t think much of it. Allie , however, posted on her Instagram story a picture of papers to grade at a local coffee shop implying she was there around 4:30 when I knew she was still at the bar with the Dave. I thought it was odd, but I was busy with the last days of 2025. 

All of January there has been a vibe. I have no hard evidence, but it feels like I’m a bit of a third wheel.

Last week during a meeting, I get a group message from the Dave with Allie in it. All it said was, “What a lucky pen 😉.” I looked at my pen and was confused. Then I looked up at Allie, who had not yet seen the text message, and her pen was in her mouth and hanging off her lips.

Dave must have realized his mistake and then tried to justify the text.

Today they asked me to do happy hour Friday because of how long of a week it’s been with the snow. I suggested bringing spouses, and they kind of poo pood it again. I then kind of blew up on them.

I didn’t necessarily accuse them of anything, but I just said that I didn’t know what the fuck this was, but I’m not interested in being a part of it. They both seemed a little confused and embarrassed. Now I’m worried that I misread the situation and messed up my work relationships.

1qpxwaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDDpartners/comments/1qpxwaf/overbearing_sleep_needs/,Overbearing sleep needs,"Now first of all yes sleep is wildly important and somewhat a ""selfish"" act, so to say. Oneself must prioritize their sleep and would assume others are sympathetic too.

That said, my perimeno partner with significant anger issues in luteal has sleep quality/intensity needs that seem to exceed a toddler.

For example: Even if her normal weekday alarm has gone off, and especially when it definitely an appropriate time for the rest of the house to be moving (breakfast, kid and myself to get to school, etc), she acts like she cannot be even slightly disturbed. I don't go out of my way to make noise - I'm not looking for this fight - but I do have to reasonably be able to find things needed to go walk the dog, check my phone, get coffee going, etc. We live in an apartment so my kid and I need to get ready a room away, but the door is closed. For unrelated reasons to this discussion I'm pretty methodical about where I put my stuff so please understand I'm not loudly searching the room for keys etc. The amount of uncertainty about how much denial is going on in the morning - and if you can get yelled at - is tough and I'm happy when she is forced to get up earlier for work because it paradoxically heads this off.

Secondly, the final hours of evening before sleep. You'd think that  she has to come down off 10 espressos with how many tuning out tasks she needs (and is mad if you don't play along). Hours of TV, many vitamins, edibles and Rx. Essentially she does not exist for hours of the evening, although she's right there, to get ready to slide into sleep. Good sleep hygiene is important but she will also rip a giant fight at night so I'm not buying it.

Finally, during the night, the tossing and throwing of pillows and sheets etc. There's no rhyme or reason to this - she can be too hot when it's the same exact temperature as another day when she's freezing and it's all my fault. We can sleep in a winter house and get a crack of winter fresh air from the window and she's fine, but in a warmer apartment, or if her final hours of soothing go wrong, she will be ""cold"" all night at exactly the same temperatures or warmer. She then can loudly sigh or throw things around the house, go looking around the apartment for LEDs to cover up (that are not in eyesight in bed), unplug nightlights in places two rooms away, etc. It's really stressful and it affects my sleep quality.

I'm a pretty light sleeper myself so believe me there are no lights on, noisy things, etc.

This is all to say that I have less trouble than this with my hyperactive kid at any age. I struggle to try to help her. If it's too much to handle I just tell my kid I'm ""camping"" (which he loves) and then she can be upset on her own with less damage done.

I would appreciate any comments because although I dodged a bullet tonight it can be tricky if I don't have all my preps ready for me to squeeze in my sleep.",1,1769658806.0,PMDDpartners,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1qpxst3,https://www.reddit.com/r/alchemy/comments/1qpxst3/masonic_secret_to_divine_consciousness/,Masonic Secret to Divine Consciousness,"Study astrology, alchemy, witchcraft, voodoo, etc. The topics that they want you to believe are ridiculous. They are very real. They don't want you to study it because they don't want you to gain that much power and use it against them.  

The 12 apostles are based on the 12 zodiac signs. Jesus lived to be 33 years old, there are also 33 degrees in the Masonic Scottish Rite. There are 33 bones in your spine. The kundalini begins at the base of your spine when the moon passes through your zodiac sign each month.  

They intentionally threw off this cycle by making 12 months in a year rather than 13 months to match the 13 zodiac signs. The solar calendar does not match the lunar calendar on purpose. The 13th zodiac was erased from history. The Ophiuchus or the serpent bearer, like the serpent in the garden of Eden. The serpent in the garden is debated to be Lucifer. Both Lucifer and Jesus are known as the morning star. Venus is also known as the morning star. 

Each day it ascends one bone as long as you refrain from the deadly sins. No sex, no wrath, no gluttony, that's why fasting is important. And also, why we as Americans are over fed and have a higher rate of obesity. Because they are trying to stuff our faces with food, so we don't accidentally open our third eye. Also, no acidic foods. It will destroy the kundalini. No coffee either. If it is a major addiction in the US then avoid it. No caffeine, no sugar, no nicotine, no drugs, and so on. The only exception is DMT, I know this is a psychedelic drug that they use in their rituals to assist in opening their third eye.  

Everything in the US is structured to make sure we never reach this state.  

Lust, Men are taught that the more women they have sex with the cooler they are. Women are taught that OnlyFans is empowering. Porn is also free and sex is in all media.  

Envy, we are taught to envy the rich. Their expensive homes, their fast cars, designer clothes, and exotic trips. 

Wrath, we are taught to hate each other for one reason or another whether it be for race, religion, sex, political beliefs, etc.  

Pride, we are taught to take pride in our nation to the point of ignorance and blind belief in authority. 

Gluttony, we are overfed as Americans which is why we have such a high rate of obesity. Our food is also tainted with ingredients that hinder our chances of reaching this state. 

Sloth, we are fed sites like Tik Tok and social media where we spend more time doom scrolling than we do exercising or attempting to build a better life for ourselves. 

Greed, we are taught to look out after ourselves only. We are made to believe in the scarcity mindset, where there aren't enough resources to go around so we keep more for ourselves and never share.  

You must also feel authentic compassion towards others. The point is to open your heart. The saying ""Heart of gold"" did not come from nowhere. Scientists found that there are more pathways sending signals from the heart to the brain than from the brain to the heart. There is a reason the heart was considered the most important part of your body in ancient times. 

Once it makes it to the top of our spine into the pineal gland it stays there for a few days. Jesus was resurrected on the third day. On the third day it drops down back to the base of our spine.  

Congratulations you are now a god. You can manipulate reality around you and even read minds of others. Your mind will exist on a higher plane than this 3 dimensional one so you can access other objects that are on that plane though unconsciously, including other people's minds. You will retain your memory after death because this body is temporary, but your mind has now accessed a higher plane of existence. You will be born in a new body after some time of void and darkness, but you will keep all the memories of your past life. You are now also immortal.  

I believe they may have possibly left some information out, but this is the truth that I know so far. You may have to wait until the full moon passes through your zodiac sign. You also might have to do the Wim Hoff miracle breathing technique regularly while meditating on your chakras. And they may have left out important information about Venus, but I am not sure.  ",0,1769658544.0,alchemy,1,0.33,False

Thought I'd share how it's actually holding up in real life—no hype, just the stuff that matters day-to-day.

First thing that blew me away: those thresholds. My place has the classic raised ones—bathroom door track is like 2-3 cm, then the kitchen has this annoying lip from tile to wood, and even the sliding patio door track trips up my old bot all the time. This thing's AdaptiLift chassis just... lifts and climbs right over them, up to like 8-9 cm in some tests I've seen. No more ""robot stuck"" notifications popping up on my phone while I'm out. I set it to clean the whole place, come back, and it's actually done the whole floor without me having to go rescue it. Huge win for anyone with uneven transitions or multiple room levels.

Suction is ridiculous—35k-36k Pa feels legit. My dog sheds like crazy, and my roommate has super long hair that used to wrap around the brush on the previous model every run. The DuoDivide anti-tangle system is doing its job; I haven't cleaned the hair on it this week. It just powers through piles of pet hair on the rug without clogging. Even picked up random crumbs and dirt from under the couch better than before.

Navigation is smarter in cluttered spots too. Living room always has shoes kicked off by the door, charging cables snaking around, kid toys if friends bring their little ones over— the triple light + camera setup spots them and goes around without bumping much. It even squeezes under my low sofa (retracts the sensor) and gets those dust bunnies I usually ignore. Fewer ""stuck on sock"" moments, which used to happen daily.

Mopping is where it's really shining for me. That extendable VibraRise pad slides out to hit the edges and corners perfectly—kitchen baseboards where sauce splatters dry up, or around the toilet where stuff gets gross. It vibrates super fast (4,000 times a minute) with good pressure, so dried paw prints from the dog or coffee spills actually come up instead of just smearing. Dock washes the mop with hot water (basically boiling) and dries it, so no funky smells anymore. I used to hate mopping because it'd leave streaks or stink after a day; this is basically set-it-and-forget-it.

The smart stuff with MindGPT is fun too—voice commands work better, it boosts power when it detects heavier dirt, and the pet patrol thing actually finds my dog when he's napping in weird spots and sends pics. Handy when I'm at work and wanna check he's okay.

Downsides? Setup took a bit longer with the new mapping and AI learning my layout, but once it's done, it's smooth. App is still great, no major bugs so far. Pricey, but if you're tired of your current bot getting stuck on every little thing or not handling hair/messes well, this feels like a solid upgrade.

Anyone else running this yet? How's it treating you in your space?

“I really enjoyed meeting you tonight and think you’re lovely, but I didn’t feel the kind of spark I’m looking for.”  

Is this the new standard let him down easy response? Is it a real thing? 

It feels like people (women in my experience) are expecting love at first sight? I don’t necessarily disagree with it. But I know it’s not for me. I need to see somebody more than once to warm up to them. I need to do more than just coffee or dinner to make a decision if I think things at least didn’t go poorly. 

I think about how almost none of my friends - would I call them friends after one day. It was after getting together more than once that we became friends. Why would finding love be different? 

Am I just screwed? Or do people have unrealistic expectations of a first date? Or how do you get that spark? What is it? How do you convey it better?",1,1769658418.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I feel like I am unraveling at the seams. I am with the littles all day and while im trying to deal with one the other is causing problems. today the toddler broke my husbands keyboard because I stupidly left my coffee cup on the desk thinking they couldnt reach it and the monkey climbed into the desk chair and spilled it all over.

the littles are sick with some kind of cold and all boogery.

the school aged child is doing better with his recent med change but is argumentative and has to be told 7-8 times to do their homework that would only take them 15 minutes.

my husband works from before sun up to sun down, and while I am so very greatful for his sacrifice it gets to the point some days I feel like I have to tell him my day was fine when it wasn't because if I say I had a hard day he will say his was worse at work. 

I feel like I am failing everyone and biting everyone's head off, but at the same time I dont feel like I can take a break and have a minute to myself cause there is always someone wanting or needing something

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

The 12 apostles are based on the 12 zodiac signs. Jesus lived to be 33 years old, there are also 33 degrees in the Masonic Scottish Rite. There are 33 bones in your spine. The kundalini begins at the base of your spine when the moon passes through your zodiac sign each month.  

They intentionally threw off this cycle by making 12 months in a year rather than 13 months to match the 13 zodiac signs. The solar calendar does not match the lunar calendar on purpose. The 13th zodiac was erased from history. The Ophiuchus or the serpent bearer, like the serpent in the garden of Eden. The serpent in the garden is debated to be Lucifer. Both Lucifer and Jesus are known as the morning star. Venus is also known as the morning star. 

Each day it ascends one bone as long as you refrain from the deadly sins. No sex, no wrath, no gluttony, that's why fasting is important. And also, why we as Americans are over fed and have a higher rate of obesity. Because they are trying to stuff our faces with food, so we don't accidentally open our third eye. Also, no acidic foods. It will destroy the kundalini. No coffee either. If it is a major addiction in the US then avoid it. No caffeine, no sugar, no nicotine, no drugs, and so on. The only exception is DMT, I know this is a psychedelic drug that they use in their rituals to assist in opening their third eye.  

Everything in the US is structured to make sure we never reach this state.  

Lust, Men are taught that the more women they have sex with the cooler they are. Women are taught that OnlyFans is empowering. Porn is also free and sex is in all media.  

Envy, we are taught to envy the rich. Their expensive homes, their fast cares, designer clothes, and exotic trips. 

Wrath, we are taught to hate each other for one reason or another whether it be for race, religion, sex, political beliefs, etc.  

Pride, we are taught to take pride in our nation to the point of ignorance and blind belief in authority. 

Gluttony, we are overfed as Americans which is why we have such a high rate of obesity. Our food is also tainted with ingredients that hinder our chances of reaching this state. 

Sloth, we are fed sites like Tik Tok and social media where we spend more time doom scrolling than we do exercising or attempting to build a better life for ourselves. 

Greed, we are taught to look out after ourselves only. We are made to believe in the scarcity mindset, where there aren't enough resources to go around so we keep more for ourselves and never share.  

You must also feel authentic compassion towards others. The point is to open your heart. The saying ""Heart of gold"" did not come from nowhere. Scientists found that there are more pathways sending signals from the heart to the brain than from the brain to the heart. There is a reason the heart was considered the most important part of your body in ancient times. 

Once it makes it to the top of our spine into the pineal gland it stays there for a few days. Jesus was resurrected on the third day. On the third day it drops down back to the base of our spine.  

Congratulations you are now a god. You can manipulate reality around you and even read minds of others.

You will retain your memory after death because this body is temporary, but your mind has now accessed a higher plane of existence. You will be born in a new body after some time of void and darkness, but you will keep all the memories of your past life. You are now also immortal.

1qpxjom,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Kanyesmydaddy/comments/1qpxjom/my_freebase_to_salt_tek/,My Freebase to Salt Tek,"Ingredient List:

\* 1 gram N,N-DMT Freebase

\* 0.5 gram Fumaric Acid

\* 200ml 99.9% or greater food grade ethanol

\* 50ml distilled or de-ionized water chilled to 10c or less (50f)

Equipment List:

\* Glassware:

\* 250ml glass vessel (borosilicate Kjeldahl reaction flask preferred)

\* 3x 200ml glass vessel (standard borosilicate beaker preferred)

\* 40ml shot glass

\* Precipitation dish or glass casserole dish

\* 2x 10m glass pipette

\* 2x Glass stir rod (optional)

\* 3x Grade 2 filter paper or coffee filters

\* Stir Plate (optional)

\* Stir Bar (optional)

\* Small Desk Fan (optional but highly recommended)

\* Rotovap (completely optional)

The Process:

1. In your reaction flask add your DMT freebase along with 40ml ethanol. Stir gently with your stir plate or glass rod until all DMT has dissolved and solution appears clear.

2. In one of the 200ml beakers, add 40ml of ethanol then mix in your fumaric acid until it has all dissolved and this solution also appears clear.

3. Under medium stirring pipette 5ml or so at a time of your fumaric acid ethanol solution into the reaction flask. You should immediately see DMT Fumarate crash out. Continue adding your fumaric acid solution until you’ve exhausted it. Continue to stir for roughly 10-minutes.

\* Since this tek calls for an abundance of fumaric acid, you will likely notice that nothing extra is precipitating out towards the second half of you adding the fumaric acid solution. This is to be expected. It is better to use too much acid and convert all to fumarate than not use enough. We will address the excess acid later.

4. Soak 2 of your filters in fresh ethanol, placing one of your filter papers over a fresh 200ml glass vessel. 

5. Pour the precipitate and used solvent from your reaction flask through filter. 

6. Rinse your reaction flask with another 20ml of fresh ethanol and pour onto filter paper with your existing precipitate.

7. Place your precipitate in a fresh 200ml vessel. You can discard the used solvent at this point or save to distill in the future.

\* At this point, you already have DMT Fumarate but there’s likely some acid still remaining. We will be removing it in the next steps.

8. Add 50ml of fresh ethanol and stir vigorously for roughly 1 minute.

9. Clean one of the prior 200ml vessels and place your other soaked filter paper on it. Pour your solution into it, once again allowing the filter to catch your solids.

10. Repeat steps 7-9 once more (two solvent washes). 

11. Place the solids from your filter paper onto your precipitation dish and allow to dry fully. It is very important that everything is completely dry before proceeding.

12. Scrape your dried DMT Fumarate and save it somewhere. Clean your precipitation dish for a later step.

13. Clean another of the 200ml vessels and place your last filter paper over it. Spray your filter paper with roughly 10ml of your water.

14. Place your dry DMT Fumarate into your shot glass. Then add the remaining 40ml of chilled water.

15. Quickly decant the water onto the filter paper. You can discard the filter paper and any solids it may have.

16. Place your 50ml water DMT Fumarate solution onto your precipitation dish and evaporate off the excess water with your fan on low. You could also choose to use a rotovap but it’s excessive.

17. Scrape your beautiful white DMT Furmate and place in a storage vessel of your choosing. It will likely be a thin opaque sheet. After scraping and chopping it will be a fluffy powder.",1,1769657847.0,u_Kanyesmydaddy,0,1.0,False

When they came home, I realized he didnt bring my food. He had forgotten to even order my food. He was immediately apologetic, offered for me to eat his (which i declined), etc. However, I was HURT. Made me feel like i must not be that important for him to have forgotten to get food for me, especially considering we discussed what I wanted as he was walking out the door AND I texted it to him. Again, I was super hurt by it but got over it. 

Fast forward to yesterday, Ive come down with the flu. He called me on the way home to ask if I wanted anything from the coffee shop. I asked for a hot tea. He came home without it - got his but forgot mine. He made me one when he got home and discovered he’d forgotten. I was a little annoyed but moved on. 

Today, he called as he was getting out of his car and walking inside the coffee place and asked if I wanted anything. I asked for a hot tea. Again, he came home with his but not mine. This time, he realized before I said anything, and made me one. 

Now I’m really annoyed. It’s not about the tea, it’s the principle. why do you keep forgetting? I do so much for our family and always make sure everyone is straight. So, to me, it feels like a slap in the face. On the other hand, I feel so ridiculous and dramatic even typing this all out. So, yeah, AIO?",61,1769657755.0,AmIOverreacting,43,0.98,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I'm Lemon, nice to meet ya. I'm your typical local cottagecore lesbian, cardigans are the g.o.a.t. Speaking of goats I'm a Capricorn, so I'm as loyal as they come, plus I'm hilarious. I have a very niche collection of unhinged memes, and I think each of them are comedy gold.I'm definitely the artsy type, an art nerd if u will. The crafting Gods have me in a chokehold. Also, I love gardening, currently my aloe is making babies like crazy. Currently I am obsessed with this mobile game called Heartopia, you can have pets on there, and I have a dog named Orange juice and a cat named Apple juice in . I have four parakeets, and they are my whole world. And I can and will spam pictures of them.

What I'm looking for:

• 20-34 if you are under the age of 20 please don't message me.
• A long term monogamous relationship, with the end goal of marriage. ( I date to marry, ikik it's uncommon these days).
• Shared experience is extremely important to me. Due to that I'm Les4Les only. Therefore, I'm only interested in cis and trans lesbian women only.
• No kids. I'm unsure if I want kids in the future. Even if I did though I don't want bio kids.
• I prefer women on the nerdier side.
• No drugs (including weed, vaping, or cigarettes)

Date ideas:
~~~~~~~~
• A sketchbook date at a cozy coffee shop.
• A lil thrift date, let's find cute shirts together.
• A picnic in a field of flowers, and I can make u a cute flower crown.

Disclaimers:
~~~~~~~~
• I'm autistic and have hyper mobility. Both of which are disabilities that affect my daily life.
•I'm only interested in long-term relationships. Forming an emotional connection with someone is extremely important to me. So if you're only looking for ""casual""  you will not find that here.

₹120 coffee here.

₹90 delivery fee there.

₹60 “just a snack.”

Individually harmless. Together? Almost ₹4,500 in a month.

2. Convenience is expensive and I was paying happily

Food delivery > cooking

Auto > walking

I paid more for comfort than I did for necessities.

3. I wasn’t overspending on big things at all

No shopping sprees.

No gadgets.

No trips.

Yet money kept disappearing. Death by a thousand cuts is real.

4. The worst part? I don’t even remember half these spends

That’s what scared me most.

If I can’t remember where my money went, how can I control it?

5. Awareness changed behavior automatically

No strict rules.

No “from tomorrow I’ll save.”

Just seeing the numbers made me pause before spending.

Hey #TravelTrotters! Ever dreamed of sipping coffee where Starbucks began, seeing iconic fish fly, or exploring the backdrop of your favorite movies? Seattle, the Emerald City, calls! Beyond its rainy reputation, this Pacific Northwest gem is a hub of vibrant culture, incredible food, and breathtaking nature. Perfect for a weekend escape or a longer adventure, let's dive into making your Seattle trip unforgettable!

Landing at Sea-Tac (SEA) is a breeze. Once you've grabbed your bags and cleared US Customs, hop on the Link Light Rail 🚆 – it's super convenient and only $3 to whisk you downtown in about 38 minutes! Seriously, for exploring the city center, leave the car behind. Seattle's public transport is fantastic, with trains, buses, ferries, and even a Monorail connecting key spots. Grab an ORCA card ($3) and load up a $6 Day Pass for unlimited rides – easy peasy! 🚌⛴️ Driving is generally unnecessary for downtown exploration, as parking is expensive and traffic can be heavy.

**Where to Nest in the Emerald City:**
*   **Downtown/Belltown:** Right in the thick of it, steps from Pike Place Market and the waterfront. Buzzing and convenient.
*   **Lower Queen Anne:** Your go-to for Space Needle views and quick access to Seattle Center museums. More residential, but still lively.
*   **Capitol Hill:** If you crave cool vibes, excellent eats, and a youthful, artsy scene, this is your spot! 🎨
*   **Fremont:** Quirky and bohemian, home to the famous Fremont Troll and a Lenin statue. Explore unique shops and cafes.

**Must-Do Experiences:**
*   **Pike Place Market 🐟🌸:** A sensory explosion! Watch the fish fly, grab a bouquet, sip coffee at the original Starbucks, and brave the Gum Wall. Don't miss sampling all the delicious local treats!
*   **Space Needle & Chihuly Garden and Glass 🏙️✨:** Get those iconic panoramic views, then immerse yourself in Dale Chihuly's stunning blown-glass art right next door. You can save with a Seattle CityPASS if you plan to hit a few major attractions – it includes these two plus three more!
*   **Museum of Pop Culture (MoPOP) 🎸🎮:** Dive into music, sci-fi, and gaming. Super interactive and fun!
*   **Kerry Park 📸:** For that quintessential Seattle skyline shot with Mount Rainier in the background (on a clear day!). Absolutely worth it.
*   **Ferry to Bainbridge Island ⛴️:** A scenic, affordable ride offering fantastic city views and a charming island town to explore.

**Sip, Savor, & Explore:**
Seattle's coffee culture is legendary for a reason – explore independent roasters beyond Starbucks! And when it comes to food, fresh seafood is a must-try. Think clam chowder, salmon, and oysters straight from the Puget Sound. 🍤☕

**Beyond the City (Day Trips):**
Got an extra day or two?
*   **Snoqualmie Falls:** A powerful 268-foot waterfall, easily accessible. 💧
*   **Woodinville Wine Country:** Taste some Washington State wines at places like Chateau Ste. Michelle. 🍷
*   **Mount Rainier National Park:** If you have a full day and love epic scenery, this iconic peak is a showstopper. Check for timed entry reservations! ⛰️

**Trotter's Budget Hacks:**
*   **Walk everywhere you can!** It's a great way to see the city. 🚶‍♀️
*   **Off-peak travel:** Fall/winter offers better hotel deals and fewer crowds (just pack your rain jacket!).
*   **Free attractions:** Pike Place, Kerry Park, Olympic Sculpture Park – all amazing and free!
*   **Reusable water bottle:** Seattle tap water is delicious and safe. 💧
*   **Groceries:** Hit up local supermarkets for snacks and some meals to save cash.

**When to Visit:**
Summers (June-August) are gloriously sunny and warm, but also the busiest. My personal pick? Early fall (September-October) – still pleasant, fewer crowds, and often better prices.

I'm hoping someone here might have some experience with this.  
Lately I've been trying to improve my espresso and take advantage of some of the advanced features of the BDB. Specifically I've noticed that pre-infusion takes a long time to wet the puck and produce a few drips in the cup.  
I know that the preinfusion pressure is adjusting the pump speed by percentage and changing the flow rate, and that preinfusion will likely have to be adjusted for each coffee slightly because they're all going to have different characteristics; but I was wondering what sort of metrics or signs people are using to determine when to increase flow/decrease flow, or adjust time to get a good result.

They are very real. They don't want you to study it because they don't want you to gain that much power and use it against them.  

The 12 apostles are based on the 12 zodiac signs. Jesus lived to be 33 years old, there are also 33 degrees in the Masonic Scottish Rite. There are 33 bones in your spine. The kundalini begins at the base of your spine when the moon passes through your zodiac sign each month.  

They intentionally threw off this cycle by making 12 months in a year rather than 13 months to match the 13 zodiac signs. The solar calendar does not match the lunar calendar on purpose. The 13th zodiac was erased from history. The Ophiuchus or the serpent bearer, like the serpent in the garden of Eden. The serpent in the garden is debated to be Lucifer. Both Lucifer and Jesus are known as the morning star. Venus is also known as the morning star. 

Each day it ascends one bone as long as you refrain from the deadly sins. No sex, no wrath, no gluttony, that's why fasting is important. And also, why we as Americans are over fed and have a higher rate of obesity. Because they are trying to stuff our faces with food, so we don't accidentally open our third eye. Also, no acidic foods. It will destroy the kundalini. No coffee either. If it is a major addiction in the US then avoid it. No caffeine, no sugar, no nicotine, no drugs, and so on. The only exception is DMT, I know this is a psychedelic drug that they use in their rituals to assist in opening their third eye.  

Everything in the US is structured to make sure we never reach this state.  

Lust, Men are taught that the more women they have sex with the cooler they are. Women are taught that OnlyFans is empowering. Porn is also free and sex is in all media.  

Envy, we are taught to envy the rich. Their expensive homes, their fast cares, designer clothes, and exotic trips. 

Wrath, we are taught to hate each other for one reason or another whether it be for race, religion, sex, political beliefs, etc.  

Pride, we are taught to take pride in our nation to the point of ignorance and blind belief in authority. 

Gluttony, we are overfed as Americans which is why we have such a high rate of obesity. Our food is also tainted with ingredients that hinder our chances of reaching this state. 

Sloth, we are fed sites like Tik Tok and social media where we spend more time doom scrolling than we do exercising or attempting to build a better life for ourselves. 

Greed, we are taught to look out after ourselves only. We are made to believe in the scarcity mindset, where there aren't enough resources to go around so we keep more for ourselves and never share.  

You must also feel authentic compassion towards others. The point is to open your heart. The saying ""Heart of gold"" did not come from nowhere. Scientists found that there are more pathways sending signals from the heart to the brain than from the brain to the heart. There is a reason the heart was considered the most important part of your body in ancient times. 

Once it makes it to the top of our spine into the pineal gland it stays there for a few days. Jesus was resurrected on the third day. On the third day it drops down back to the base of our spine.  

Congratulations you are now a god. You can manipulate reality around you and even read minds of others. Your mind will exist on a higher plane than this 3 dimensional one so you can access other objects that are on that plane though unconsciously, including other people's minds. You will retain your memory after death because this body is temporary, but your mind has now accessed a higher plane of existence. You will be born in a new body after some time of void and darkness, but you will keep all the memories of your past life. You are now also immortal.  

I believe they may have possibly left some information out, but this is the truth that I know so far. You may have to wait until the full moon passes through your zodiac sign. You also might have to do the Wim Hoff miracle breathing technique regularly while meditating on your chakras. And they may have left out important information about Venus, but I am not sure.

I’ve recently noticed this odd, white staining that has randomly shown up on my top incisors within the past month or so.

I use Colgate Baking Soda & Peroxide toothpaste. 

Additionally, I noticed these “rings” around my molars that do not seem to come off. I am unsure if these two things are related or not. My last dental appointment was in November, and I did not have any cavities or any comments from the dentist. However, I am unsure when these rings showed up as I noticed them when I was looking at my incisors.

I went cold turkey nine months ago.

Since then, I’ve had a small cup of Coke once a week when I play pool (they give it for free). I don’t really feel anything, probably around 150 ml total weekly. I’ve also had one cup of black tea once, one decaf once, and dark chocolate maybe two or three times. Other than that, I’ve been completely clean.

**Benefits:**

* I can think slower, more clearly, and more rationally
* I feel calmer and more clear-headed
* Breathing is better
* Heart/chest pain is about 80% better

**Neutral:**

* Sleep is probably better, but I can’t really tell anymore
* I sleep earlier and wake up earlier (I don’t care much about this, but it's probably good) 

**Cons:**

* Less motivated to “hustle” (this is a big con for me, since work is important at this stage of my life)
* Some fatigue at times
* Bigger appetite and some weight gain

1qpwnaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1qpwnaj/i_hate_being_a_caretaker/,I hate being a caretaker,"My mother lives a slovenly disgusting life and always has. It’s gotten worse over the years as she’s aged but she recently had an accident that happened due to her neglecting her health and surgeries for over a decade. She’s now handicapped  and I believe it will be permanent. I moved her in with me a few years ago(accident was in early November) to try and give her a better life and she doubled down on the pos person she’s always been. 

I have 3 other siblings.  They all don’t have to deal with her in this capacity. My younger brother lived with her and literally ran away 3 years ago to start a new life and I see exactly why now. I just got home from work and brought her dinner in because im a Chef. 

I expressed some frustrations with her and she had the fucking audacity to say “you’re not my caretaker, all I require from you is a coffee here and there”…meanwhile I bring her all her meals. Before I go to work I make sure she has something to eat until I get home because she’s wheelchair bound and can’t access a lot of the kitchen. Mind you she makes no attempts. Doesn’t do her exercises to build her arm strength even after it’s been damn near 3 months since her accident. I work minimum 10 hours a day. I love my work so that’s a plus but it’s still a long time. I have to really rearrange my life regularly for her. 

Meanwhile just lays in her own filth smoking cigarettes which directly effect the rate of her recovery at her age. I Make her meals and did so way before her accident. Not all of her meals before the accident but she had 2 guaranteed meals on my off days. I always brought something home from work so eventually it turned into her knowing I was bringing food so she didn’t have to always feed herself everyday.

 I have to go pay her insurance every 2 weeks. I take her to all appointments and there’s been multiple each month. Which means safely getting her to the house and in the car. Then breaking down her wheel chair and jamming it in out tiny Kia. I have multiple herniated disks that cause me daily issues so this is super hard for me to the point I want to cry sometimes. I used to be so strong and the chair is heavy but not THAT heavy. The  bending and pushing and adjusting is the real issue and it genuinely hurts so bad. 

Getting her to the hospital, fixing the wheelchair back up, wheeling her in. Running BACK outside to go park. Running back in to wheel her to the elevator to get to her appointment. Waiting and wheeling her out. Getting her back in the car safely, then breaking the chair  down again. Driving us home. Undoing the fucking wheel chair to get her inside, like its so much shit every-time!!!!! I’ve missed so much work dealing with her appointments and piss fucking poor communication so that’s even LESS money coming into the household. 

I hired someone with MY money to clean her filthy fucking room because she can’t now but before she “couldn’t,”she literally never did anyway, AND her wound got infected because she’s a filthy person and I never wanted to smell that or deal with that again. Paid one months rent on my own (due to busting  ass for hella overtime) just to lift some financial burden from HER! None of that matters to her. She feels she’s owed all of this WHEN I KNOW FOR FACTS, my other siblings would not; they would NOT be what I am to her what so ever. And I’m fucking pissed! 

My uncle (her brother) has told me multiple times, she treats me this way because she knows she can. And that convo replays in my head DAILY! I want so badly to treat her how she treated me growing up, HELL, as she has my whole life, but my heart won’t let me!!!! I always feel such guilt! I know if I don’t care for her she’s going to be miserable…BUT IM MISERABLE NOW! And idk how to stop it! Obviously I know what to do but I can’t bring myself to do it. Everything in me after today is telling me not to do shit else for her but grab her cigarettes since “that’s all I do for her” but my heart can’t take it.

I’ve been trying to go caffeine-free because of PCOS, which I’ve been dealing with for a few years now. Coffee used to be my best friend, especially when working like no question. About 4 months ago I decided to quit coffee and stick to teas instead, and honestly it’s been going really well. I didn’t think I could do it, but I managed to keep the obsession under control.

What helped a lot was going to the gym almost daily just to stay busy, drinking tons of water, and making fruit-infused water or juice at home. I felt more stable overall.

Then my mom came to visit and offered to have coffee with me… and I caved 😅 I didn’t think much of it, but wow. After not having coffee for a while, it hit me HARD. My heart was racing on and off, I could literally feel my heartbeat in my throat, and I kept coughing even though I wasn’t sick. I was okay, but it was honestly scary and first time I’ve ever felt palpitations like that.

It really reminded me why I quit in the first place. Curious if anyone else here had a similar experience after reintroducing caffeine after a break?",2,1769655312.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

By the time you finish reading, you’ll understand who does what, how to choose the right team, and how to build an end‑of‑life plan that protects your loved one’s dignity and your own health as a caregiver. Let’s start with a clear, plain‑language look at what end‑of‑life care at home really looks like in Sun City Center and Apollo Beach.

# Quick Answer: What Certified Home Health Aides and Hospice Support Do at End of Life in Sun City Center & Apollo Beach

A certified home health aide and hospice support team help your loved one stay safe, clean, and comfortable at home while managing the physical and emotional realities of end-of-life care. Certified Home Health Aide & Hospice Support for End-of-Life Care in Sun City Center & Apollo Beach, FL typically includes hands-on help with bathing, dressing, toileting, repositioning, light meals, and companionship, while hospice nurses manage pain, symptoms, and medication. Together, they focus on dignity, comfort, and family support rather than aggressive treatment, and they coordinate visits around your schedule and local homes, senior communities, and facilities in Sun City Center, Apollo Beach, Wimauma, and Ruskin.

In simple terms: hospice provides the medical direction and comfort plan, and certified home health aides provide the day‑to‑day hands-on care that makes that plan work in your living room or bedroom. You’re not expected to lift alone, guess about skin issues, or manage every task when you’re exhausted. This combination of hospice and aide support is designed so your loved one can spend more time at home, surrounded by familiar people and routines, instead of bouncing between hospitals and facilities.

# How End-of-Life Care at Home Really Works in Sun City Center & Apollo Beach

End-of-life care at home brings medical and non-medical support to your address instead of asking your loved one to keep traveling back and forth to appointments. Hospice focuses on comfort and quality of life in the final months, while home health aides and caregivers handle the daily basics like bathing, mobility, and hygiene that keep your loved one safe and dignified. In Sun City Center & Apollo Beach, that often means a mix of hospice nurses, aides, family caregivers, and trusted local transportation working together.

Here’s how it usually fits together. Hospice is ordered by a doctor when treatment is shifting from “cure” to comfort. A hospice nurse visits to adjust medications, manage pain or breathing issues, and check on how things are going. Certified aides come on a schedule—maybe several times a week—to help with showers, linen changes, and transfers from bed to chair. Family fills in the gaps, while medical transportation handles trips to important appointments or procedures that still need to happen at Tampa General, Brandon, South Bay, or other area facilities.

A “typical day” might look like this: an aide helps your loved one bathe safely and get dressed, changes bedding, and positions pillows to prevent soreness. Later, the hospice nurse stops in to evaluate pain control and update medications. A family member coordinates a future appointment and, if needed, arranges door-through-door wheelchair or stretcher transport so nobody has to struggle with stairs, walkers, and long hospital hallways alone. Everything is centered on comfort, not rushing.

# Certified Home Health Aides: What They Actually Do for End-of-Life Patients at Home

A certified home health aide (often an HHA or CNA) is the person who handles the intimate, hands-on care that most families find hardest to manage physically and emotionally. Their job in end-of-life care is to help your loved one stay clean, comfortable, and safe while preserving as much dignity and independence as possible. For Certified Home Health Aide & Hospice Support for End-of-Life Care in Sun City Center & Apollo Beach, FL, this often means regular visits focused on bathing, dressing, toileting, and gentle movement rather than medical procedures.

On a typical visit, an aide might help with a full or partial bath, shampooing hair, shaving, or oral care so your loved one feels like themselves. They assist with toileting, incontinence care, and changing clothes or linens if there have been accidents. They know how to reposition someone in bed to relieve pressure points, support weak joints, and reduce the risk of skin breakdown. They may prepare a simple meal, help with feeding, and make sure water, tissues, and medications (set up by nurses) are within easy reach.

Equally important, a good aide pays attention to small changes—a new bruise, increased confusion, or more trouble breathing—and reports those to hospice nurses or the family. They move at a calm pace, explain what they’re doing before each step, and respect modesty with towels and blankets. For many families in Sun City Center and Apollo Beach, the aide becomes a steady, reassuring presence: someone who knows the layout of the home, understands your loved one’s habits, and quietly keeps things on track when the day feels overwhelming.

# How to Choose the Right Home Health Aide & Hospice Support Team in Sun City Center & Apollo Beach

Choosing a team is not just about who “takes your insurance” or who can start next week—it’s about who you trust to walk into your home on the hardest days and handle very private moments with respect. A good fit combines proven end-of-life experience, clear communication, and a calm presence that makes your house feel safer, not more chaotic. In Sun City Center & Apollo Beach, you also want a provider who knows the local hospitals, senior communities, and traffic patterns so visits actually happen when promised.

Start with their experience: ask directly how often they work with end-of-life patients, not just “seniors.” Ask what training their certified home health aides receive in hospice care, dementia, and safe transfers. Ask which neighborhoods and communities they serve—Kings Point, Waterset, MiraBay, Valencia Lakes, and surrounding areas—and how they handle delays or last-minute changes from hospitals or rehabs. A strong agency will have clear answers, written policies, and no problem walking you through a typical visit.

Next, listen for how they talk about family. Do they sound rushed, or do they ask about your schedule, your concerns, and what’s hardest for you right now? Do they explain how aides work alongside hospice nurses, primary doctors, and (when needed) medical transportation, or do they act like they operate in a silo? Providers that talk about “teamwork” and “care plans” instead of just “shifts” tend to do better when things get complicated.

Finally, ask a few practical questions that families often forget: How do you match aides to clients? What happens if my loved one doesn’t click with the first person you send? How do you handle nights, weekends, and holiday coverage? What’s your backup plan if an aide calls out? The answers to these questions tell you more about reliability than any brochure ever will.

# Practical Guide: Setting Up End-of-Life Care at Home (From First Phone Call to First Visit)

Once you decide to move forward, things can move quickly—and that’s where details get dropped if you’re not prepared. Think of setting up end-of-life care at home in three stages: information gathering, coordination, and home preparation. Each one makes the next step smoother and prevents those “I wish we had known that earlier” moments.

**Stage 1: Information gathering**Before you call agencies or hospice, write down a few key details: diagnoses, mobility level (bedbound, needs help to stand, uses walker or wheelchair), any oxygen or special equipment, and recent hospitalizations. Note where your loved one will stay in the home (bedroom, living room recliner, hospital bed) and how many stairs, narrow doorways, or tight bathrooms you’re dealing with. This helps the agency decide what type of aide, schedule, and equipment will actually work in your house, not a generic floor plan.

**Stage 2: Coordination**If hospice is involved, ask who will be your primary nurse and how often they expect to visit. Then confirm how the home health aide visits will be scheduled around those nurse visits so you’re not overwhelmed by everyone showing up at once—or long gaps where you’re alone. If your loved one still needs to travel to key appointments or procedures, loop in a medical transportation provider early and share the same information: mobility, oxygen, stairs, and exact pickup/drop-off locations. A provider used to door-through-door and bed-to-bed service can help plan safe transfers that match the aide and hospice schedules instead of working against them.

**Stage 3: Home preparation**Small changes make a big difference in comfort and safety. Clear paths from bed to bathroom or commode, remove loose rugs, and add a sturdy chair or grab bar where someone sits to dress or wash. Place a table within reach of the bed for tissues, water, medications set up by nurses, and a call bell or phone. Ask your aide or nurse during the first visit, “What’s the one change we could make that would make care easier and safer here?” People who work in multiple Sun City Center and Apollo Beach homes all week will quickly spot tweaks you might never think of—like moving a lamp, rearranging furniture, or changing where the wheelchair is parked between visits.

# Common Myths and Mistakes Families Make About Hospice and Home Health Aides

A lot of stress in [end-of-life care](https://voyagetampa.com/interview/community-highlights-meet-marqus-johnson-of-wheelchair-stretcher-transportation-services-in-tampa-florida-reliable-medical-transport) comes from misunderstandings, not from bad intentions. One big myth is that “hospice means giving up,” when in reality it means shifting the goal from curing an illness to maximizing comfort, time together, and control over where and how your loved one spends their final months. Another myth is that bringing in a certified home health aide means you’re “not doing enough” as family, when in truth, aides often make it possible for families to keep caring longer without burning out.

Common mistakes include waiting too long to ask for help, assuming things will “get easier” on their own, or booking only the bare minimum of aide hours even when everyone is already exhausted. Families sometimes forget to plan for nights, weekends, or sudden changes—like a fall or a new symptom—until they’re happening in real time. Others overlook transportation entirely, only to realize at discharge that they have no safe way to get a frail, [bed-bound](https://business.utbchamber.com/list/Details/wheelchair-stretcher-transportation-services-in-tampa-florida-reliable-medical-transport-4602236), or confused loved one home.

You can avoid many of these pitfalls by treating hospice, aides, and transport as tools rather than last resorts. Call earlier than you think you “deserve” to. Ask blunt questions about what to expect as things progress. And build in more support than you think you’ll need—you can always scale back, but it’s harder to scramble for help in the middle of the night or from a hospital hallway.

# Local Wisdom: What 20+ Years of Florida Home-Based Care and Medical Transport Have Taught Us

After decades helping families in Sun City Center, Apollo Beach, [Wimauma](https://www.wheelchair-tampa.com/post/stretcher-transportation-in-tampa-florida), and Ruskin, we’ve learned that end-of-life care at home succeeds or fails in the “in‑between” moments—the 20 minutes before a visit, the ride home from the hospital, the late-night bathroom trip when everyone’s tired. Most guides talk about hospice philosophy or aide duties; very few talk about how those actually play out in real Florida homes with real driveways, elevators, parking lots, and busy clinics. That’s where our day-to-day transport and home-care experience gives a different lens.

One example: we often see care plans that look perfect on paper but ignore traffic, weather, and building layouts. A patient might be scheduled for a late-afternoon oncology appointment in Tampa, with an aide visit automatically set for 5:00 p.m. back in Sun City Center. On a map, that’s fine; in reality, rain, I‑75, and hospital delays mean the aide arrives when everyone is exhausted—or after another crisis. We’ve learned to recommend “buffered scheduling,” where transportation, hospice, and aide visits are staggered with breathing room so nobody is rushed through transfers, toileting, or pain checks just to stay “on schedule.”

We’ve also seen that families who treat transportation as part of the care team—not an afterthought—have fewer scary moments. When the transport crew knows the aide’s routine and the aide knows the driver’s style, they can coordinate things like where the wheelchair is parked after a ride, how to angle the stretcher through a tight doorway, or when to reposition someone who just spent an hour in transit. That reduces falls, skin issues, and the quiet panic caregivers feel when they’re trying to lift or slide someone on their own.

Another non-obvious insight: the home’s layout often needs to be adjusted not once, but twice. First when aides and hospice start, and again when mobility changes and stretcher or bed-to-bed transport becomes necessary. We’ve walked into beautiful rooms that are impossible to navigate with a wheelchair or stretcher because of rugs, coffee tables, or narrow turns. The families who do best invite their aides and drivers to walk the route with them early and say, “Show us what you’d change.” Those five minutes of honest, practical feedback can prevent weeks of strain and near-misses.

Our framework is simple but rare in practice: think of end-of-life care at home as a continuous path, not separate services. Hospice sets the medical plan, certified home health aides translate that plan into daily care, and safe, [door-through-door transport](https://www.wheelchair-tampa.com/wheelchair-stretcher-transportation-tampa-fl) keeps everything connected—hospital, clinic, rehab, and home—without putting your loved one or your back at risk. When those pieces are aligned, the home becomes a calmer, safer place to spend this season, and you can spend more time being family instead of constantly acting as the coordinator, mover, and problem-solver all at once.

When you put all of this together—hospice guidance, certified home health aides, and coordinated transportation—you’re really building one thing: a support system that lets your loved one stay where they feel most like themselves, at home, without you carrying every burden alone. End-of-life care in [Sun City Center](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603555/) and Apollo Beach doesn’t have to mean constant crisis; it can look like a predictable rhythm of visits, safe transfers, and quiet moments that honor your loved one’s wishes.

The most important pieces are simple but powerful: knowing what hospice does and doesn’t do, understanding how certified aides actually help day to day, and treating transportation as part of the care plan instead of an afterthought. That combination is what makes this approach different—it’s built around real Florida homes, real driveways and traffic, and real caregivers who are tired but still showing up. When you see how the pieces fit, confusing terms like “home health,” “hospice,” and “[non-emergency medical transport](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bed-sores/symptoms-causes/syc-20355893)” turn into practical tools you can actually use.

Your next step can be small: write down your loved one’s needs, your biggest worries, and a few questions from this guide to ask on your first phone calls. You don’t have to solve everything today—you just have to take the next safe, informed step. Even in a hard season, you’re allowed to build help around you so you can spend more time being family, not just the person holding everything together.",1,1769655111.0,u_Wheelchair-Tampa,0,1.0,False
1qpwh5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/1qpwh5x/looking_for_immersive_romances_that_feel_like_im/,Looking for immersive romances that feel like I’m living inside the story,"
I’m looking for romance books that make me feel like an invisible observer, fully immersed in the characters’ lives and surroundings.

I love stories where the MMC and FMC are doing simple things — taking walks, sitting at their usual café, trying food at a quirky local spot — and I can feel the atmosphere around them. The setting matters a lot to me: vivid descriptions of the sky, mountains, beaches, waterfalls, cozy towns… the kind of place that feels like home.

What I’m specifically looking for:

- Not a travel romance — at least one main character should be a resident of the place. They can show the other lead around, but I’m avoiding anything with a touristy or temporary-stay feel
- Slow-burn romance (friends to lovers / forced proximity are my favorites), but I’m open to other tropes if they fit the vibe
- No love triangles, but I’m okay with “other woman” drama as long as it doesn’t turn into a triangle
- Lots of domestic, intimate moments — backyard coffee, quiet conversations, sunsets, shared routines
- A strong sense of place, where the setting feels lived-in and almost like another character
- Character-driven stories with emotional closeness built over time
- Any level of spice is good the more the bettter ☺️

For reference, I loved the immersive, quiet feel of Archer’s Voice by Mia Sheridan it had this kind of feel in it 

Basically, I want a romance that feels so immersive it’s like I’m experiencing it, not just reading it.

We either friend-zone people who are clearly interested or make fools of ourselves misreading basic politeness as attraction.

This post synthesizes what I've learned from behavioral scientists, relationship experts like Esther Perel's podcast, and honestly, a lot of awkward trial and error. The goal? Help you spot genuine interest before you either miss your shot or embarrass yourself at the coffee shop.

Here's what actual flirting looks like when it's subtle:

**They create unnecessary proximity**

Normal friendly behavior respects personal space bubbles. Micro-flirting? They find excuses to get closer. Reaching across you for something they could've asked for. Standing closer than the situation demands. Sitting next to you when other seats are available. Dr. Monica Moore's research on courtship signals found that proximity-seeking is one of the most reliable indicators someone's interested. It's not accidental. Their subconscious is literally pulling them toward you.

**Their texting energy shifts**

Friendly texting is functional. Flirty texting lingers. They respond faster to you than others. Use more emojis with you specifically. Send memes at random times because ""this reminded me of you."" Ask questions that keep conversations going past their natural endpoint. The book ""Modern Romance"" by Aziz Ansari (yeah, the comedian turned sociologist) breaks down how digital communication patterns reveal interest levels. If someone's investing extra energy into your text threads, that's intentional.

**They remember weirdly specific details**

You mentioned your childhood dog's name once three weeks ago and they bring it up today. They ask follow-up questions about that work presentation you were stressed about. This is different from polite small talk. Psychology researcher Arthur Aron's work on intimacy shows that people encode information more deeply about those they're attracted to. It's not just good memory, it's selective attention driven by interest.

**The eye contact feels... different**

We're talking about the kind that lasts a beat too long. That holds even after the conversation naturally pauses. Researchers have found that mutual gaze triggers the same reward centers in the brain as physical touch. When someone's micro-flirting, their eyes track you across rooms. They look away when caught but keep coming back. It's charged. You can feel it in your chest.

**They find reasons to extend interactions**

""Oh you're heading that direction? I'll walk with you."" ""Want to grab coffee while we're both here?"" They manufacture scenarios to spend more time together. Social psychologist Dr. Helen Fisher calls this ""mate attraction behavior,"" where people unconsciously create opportunities for bonding. Friends say goodbye and leave. Someone interested finds reasons to stay five more minutes.

**Their body mirrors yours**

You lean in, they lean in. You cross your legs, they shift theirs. This isn't conscious mimicry, it's limbic resonance. If you want a deeper dive into attraction patterns and relationship dynamics, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from research papers, dating psychology books, and expert insights to create personalized audio content. You can set a goal like ""understand subtle flirting cues as an introvert"" and it'll build a learning plan pulling from sources like Helen Fisher's work and attachment theory research. You can adjust the depth too, from quick 15-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smoky, conversational tone that makes commute learning way less boring.

**They treat you differently than others**

This is huge. Pay attention to how they interact with other people versus you. Is their voice slightly different? Do they touch your arm during conversation but not others'? Do they laugh harder at your jokes? Relationship researcher John Gottman's work shows that preferential treatment is a clear signal of romantic interest. We unconsciously give more attention, warmth, and responsiveness to people we're attracted to.

For understanding the neuroscience behind all this, ""The Science of Love and Attraction"" by biological anthropologist Helen Fisher is genuinely fascinating. She's spent 30+ years studying romantic love using brain imaging and her findings about how attraction manifests in behavior are wild. This book made me realize how much of flirting happens below conscious awareness. Best resource I've found on why we do the weird things we do when we're into someone.

**They create inside jokes and callback humor**

Building a private language is intimacy building 101. Those references only you two understand. The running jokes from previous conversations. It's creating a micro-world that excludes others and includes just you two. If someone consistently builds this kind of conversational intimacy, they're not just being friendly. They're trying to create connection.

The tricky part? Context matters massively. Cultural differences, personality types (some people are naturally warm with everyone), and individual communication styles all factor in. One sign alone means nothing. But multiple signals consistently? Yeah, probably not just friendship.

The real skill isn't just identifying interest though, it's having the courage to reciprocate or politely redirect if you're not feeling it. Most people are terrified of making things awkward, so they stay in this weird ambiguous zone forever. Don't be that person.",1,1769654781.0,Datingat21st,0,1.0,False

So at 19 years old, HS journey began. At 21 yo, it got so bad i end up in hospital, and nearly died. I was stage 4, with around 40 holes in my body, and 4 i could put my fingers in it without touching flesh. It was just dark fucking holes.

I was around 85 pounds.

Doctor saw my adrenal glands didnt work properly. They put a drug in my blood to make the glands starts again. It didnt worked for 3 shots. They told me it was really bad for the body, so there will be no next time. The 4e time was the good one. My body could now start to fight the infection.

They put me on the most effective antibios for starters, and i needed blood too. I was near the adrenal crisis, which is when your body completely shuts down because it cant produce cortisol. I had proper bandage for my wounds. They also told me i could sue my dermato, who only put me on doxy for 2 years even if i told her it didnt worked. They made a bio analysis of the bacteria and told me that doxy were not shown to be effective on those, so i was right. They also told me i could sue because she should have put on emergency services in the same hospital she worked. Anyway... I stayed there for a month, and they did a lot of research on my body. All this time, it was just healing up and never got anything on.

They send a biopsis, like they took a chunck of my body to send it in some laboratory in California (im from canada), and my main doctor told me they didnt see anything in my genes. My genes are healthy, with no trace of genetic disease. They told me its actually not common. My doctor said it was because of my trauma and that i needed to get my shits together, stop freaking out, sleep and sun bath. So i did that...

After that, it was 10 000 UI of vitamin D3. Showers everyday. Gaining weight. Having a veeeeeery strict diet for 3 years (no carbs, no diary, no soy, no eggs, no sugar, no gluten, etc). After 3 years, i reintroduce slowly food, just to be sure, but kept eating really really good homemade food. I got a job which was very physical, like almost a training everyday. I was walking 10 to 20 km a day, 4 days a week, and was all muscles.

\*\*\*edit\*\* : I was so happy for years. I would woke up in the morning with laughter. I mean... i would woke up with pure joy and was literally LAUGHING. It was so weird. I had so much energy. All was perfect. All of this really had an effect on my body. Its like I never really lived before that, even before HS. (had a pretty bad life with a lot of abuse everyday and stress around) \*\*stop edit\*

I never had HS or anything for 10 years, like not even acne.  
Now i got a flare for two month now. The last year havent been easy.  
Beer, cigarettes (like 10-12), A LOT OF COFFEE, not enough sleep for months theres no morning where i tell myself how well ive slept, i dont exercise anymore tho i make so efforts to do sports once a week. I ate a lot of halloween chocolates, like for a nearly a year, and been eating anything and nothing. Its like I dont give a fuck about insulin reaction anymore, and eat way too much. I eat so much i got really tired after. Like wt\*

Im scared. I know what my body is telling me, but i dont know where to start, even if i did it once. Im scared its gonna get too bad like the first time before i could do something.

They kicked the door in well after midnight, I know that much because at the time I had developed a habit of watching youtube before falling asleep, and never failed to see 0000 on the clock. They came in right through the front door. The same front door that protected me for fifteen years, until that night.

I heard the huge slam of the old oak door hitting the little spring stopper at the bottom of the wall, and I heard heavy boots pounding across the fake wood floor just below my bedroom. It wasn't hard to tell where they were at, our house was barely big enough for the five of us that lived there. I immediately heard dad roll out of bed, it made the same creaking noise it did every late Sunday morning when he chose to sleep in a little. This time though, the sound was faster and I heard his feet hit the floor a lot heavier than normal. But that was all I really heard from the direction of his bedroom.

I didn't hear any voices for the longest time. The boots never stopped though, they kept pounding across the first floor of the house. They went through the living room at least twice, I heard both of the big book shelves slam to the floor and the books tumble out of them. Then they found the kitchen and I could hear some slight murmurs. I heard drawers opening with enough force that I was sure only half of them were still in the cabinets. Silverware was clanking to the floor and cups leaving their shelves. Then she screamed. I knew only two people slept on the first floor, and only one of them could reach an octave that high, my mom. Then I heard it, I heard my mother beg,

""Please, please."" she cried, I could hear that her voice was a few octaves higher than normal. ""Take anything a-anything you want. Just d-don.""

And then a shot rang out. I hadn't even started to comprehend what was happening when my body started moving on auto pilot. I rolled out of my bed and walked straight across the hall. I didn't hear much over my thoughts after the first shot. There may have been more but all I heard was,

""Get the baby, find a way out. Get the baby, find a way out.""

It replayed over and over, louder then the commotion just a floor below me. I was across the hall and lifting my four month old brother from his crib, trying to figure out what was going on when all of a sudden I heard the boots pounding down the hall, but now on my floor. My heart beat jumped to my throat as I realized the boots were coming straight in my direction, and fast. My arms were shaking with fear as I jumped with my youngest brother in my arms towards the shallow closet tucked in the corner of his room. No... their room. As I fell towards the closet, hoping there was enough room to hide, I saw my six year old brother hiding under his blankets, his little body wrapped in the race car blanket mom had just tucked him in with a few hours ago.

""What do you think this is going to stop, boy?"" said a strange male voice.

And then a body shot across the room as I stilled on the floor. I had made it mostly in the closet and under the lowest line of hangers. Mom had made sure to sort the baby clothes by size this time and had all the bigger clothes towards the bottom of the closet, hanging low enough to just barely hover above the floor. I froze, my brother tucked between my arms, as I watched the masked man rip the blankets right off of my other brother's small figure. It was hard to see well in the dark, but I watched the man grab him by the hair on his head and drag him to the floor. My brother screamed just as loud as my mother had, whimpering as the man brought my brothers head closer to his mouth, and he whispered,

""I think we are going to play a game. Do you like games, son?"" His jaw was clenched and you could just barely make out a smirk on the man's face with the glow of the nightlight in the hallway.

Then the baby cried. He pushed at my arms and screamed for dad as I squeezed my eyes shut. I didn't want to see what was going to happen next. I couldn't stop an adult. I mean I was just a kid, and I didn't even know what happened to my parents. The man stood up the rest of the way, my brother's hair in one hand and snapped his neck towards us. Slowly walking towards the closet he said with a low tone,

""Well what do we have here?""

And then he grabbed me by my arm and drug me to my feet, the baby still screaming but now clinging to my neck as if I was keeping his head above water. I couldn't open my eyes, but I could smell his breath as he breathed in my face and muttered,

""Well it looks like we have two more players, and one thinks that she's better than the rest of us.""

I didn't move a muscle. I couldn't. He had me and I knew it was over.

""Why don't we make our way downstairs, children?"" he asked as he threw us to the floor in front of him.""

I opened my eyes once I knew he was behind me and tried to pick myself up. It was hard enough with my baby brother still clinging to me, but I knew I had to get my other brother up or the man was not going to be very nice. As we walked out of the room I heard someone shout and a huge crash down in the living room again.

As we got to the bottom of the stairs I heard a groan and someone muttering something but I couldn't make anything out of it. Then my eyes adjusted and I saw my parents sitting on the couch. They were tied up somehow, their hands and feet in front of them, and they had duct tape wrapped around their faces. I could feel the hot tears burning in my eyes as I recognized what was happening.

My dad screamed something incoherent at us and the other masked figure struck him on the side of the head with a closed fist. My moms eyes were open but she was just there. She had blood matted in her hair and when I looked into her eyes, I could tell she wasn't looking back at me. The man behind me and my brother pushed us saying,

""You three go sit on the floor in the middle of the room. Mommy and Daddy are going to join you now.""

I took my brother by the hand and we went and sat down on the rug in the middle of the floor. The coffee table that was normally there had been shattered into small pieces of wood and glass and was on the other side of the living room now. Mom had just gotten this nice grey rug, it was soft and cozy when we laid on it to watch movies after school. And I sat down where I normally did, facing towards where the tv once rested on the wall and away from the couch. I didn't know what was going to happen but I couldn't look at mom anymore. Not like that. The shorter figure of the two, the one that drug us from upstairs, picked up my moms limp body and set her down right next to me, leaning her against the couch.

""M-mom."" I whimpered. I reached out for her hand but the taller man smacked my wrist.

""Don't."" he said in a deep voice.

Then my dad screamed again, through the duct tape all I could hear was the pain in his voice, and then another thump as I'm sure the taller man hit him again. The short man drug my dad in front of me and with my brother to the side of me still, we formed a small circle. The baby had looked at mom but never reached out to her, he just clung to my shirt harder than before.

""I think you guys know how to play this game. It's one of my favorites."" said a voice from behind me. I squeezed my eyes shut again willing it all to go away. ""It's called... Duck... Duck... Goose."" The words slowly fell from his mouth, each one making me jump. ""But I like to add a twist to it."" and then something fell over my eyes. ""A blind fold. It makes it more fun when you stand up to run away.""

I felt a small whimper escape from my throat as I clenched at both of my brothers. One arm wrapped around the baby and one hand holding a small little palm who was squeezing just as hard as I was.

""Don't worry, I'll go first."" and then I heard his boots start thudding around my family. Over and over he went, ""Duck... Duck... Duck..."" Dragging out each word. I jumped as something landed on my head. ""Duck."" I felt the breath leave my lungs as he took another step around our circle. ""Goose!"" and then there was a pause, no one moved. ""Oh that's right, it's probably hard to walk in that condition honey."" and a shot rang out again. It was so close and loud this time I wasn't sure if I even had any hearing left. My ears were ringing as I felt something burning on my scalp and a faint, ""Duck..."" Dread filled my limbs. The man got around to my brother and I could finally hear a little better.

""Goose, little man. You better run.""

I could feel my dad thrashing, trying to get away, and faint screams coming from a gagged mouth before the next shot went off. My heart stopped. I knew what just happened but I couldn't see. There was a pause for a while before I heard. ""Only three silly gooses left. Whose gonna try next."" Both of the boys were sobbing. I couldn't. I was so terrified that I couldn't breathe let alone cry.

""Duck..."" The man chanted without moving.

""Duck..."" The hot barrel landed just inches in front of my face, I could smell the gunpowder and feel the heat radiating from the barrel. My baby brother squirmed to get away from it.

""Goose!"" He cackled as the barrel hit the top of my own head.

And I didn't move. I didn't breathe, I didn't flinch, I didn't cry. I just held onto my brothers, until the very end.

I made a post a few days ago about the characters and their favorite coffee shop drinks, and received many creative, insightful, and funny responses, so I thought I would toss another question out to the group. You all really are a very great fandom/community.

We know Jonah loves Green Day, Dina loves Danny Boy and circus music ( but not Michael Jackson), Sandra likes ICP and also Creep by Radiohead, Garrett cannot stand the song Halloween Surfboard, Cheyenne likes Anaconda, Mateo has a love/hate relationship with Taylor Swift and likes Celine Dion, Amy likes Selena, Marcus has his own rock band— I definitely feel like I’m missing some, but I’m very curious as to what everyone else thinks, and opinions on the other characters as well.

I feel like Glenn would primarily listen to hymns and christian music (I know he brings up a few songs at different points, but can’t for the life of me remember the names of them) but I feel like he would have “guilty pleasure” songs too, the way he “didn’t watch twilight” (probably just kidz bop versions of “dirty” pop songs, tbh).

I feel like Jonah would also be into Paramore for some reason, could just be me projecting.

I can’t pinpoint an exact “music taste” for Garrett but I feel like it would be really, really good and he would have fantastic recommendations.

Absolutely no clue for Carol. Every time I come up with something for her it doesn’t seem quite right. Whatever she likes would probably shock everyone else in the store though.

* **Blake Lively says there was never a lift scene** in the script suggesting there was no reason for Justin to inquire about her weight (that she admitted he requested due to his medical condition). 
   * **Slide 1:** There was absolutely a lift scene, not only in the book but in the script as well. 
   * **Slide 2:** Lively's text to her friend...
* **Blake claims Justin was trying to add a bunch of sex scenes to the script.** The [book had a ton of sex scenes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ItEndsWithLawsuits/comments/1q6xtv3/lets_talk_about_sex_baby_a_reality_check_on_it/) Blake also claims that women's voices weren't incorporated into the writing of this film. 
   * **Slides 3-7 Ange/Sony's Feedback:** Blake didn't care about the fandom. The fandom was expecting sex, and heat. They wanted more, not less. Also the script was adapted from the book by a woman and Angle is also a woman.
* **Blake claims Justin didn't get consent for the dancing scene in the bar when he kisses her.**
   * **The video** uploaded today thanks to u/Clarknt67 shows Justin explaining to Blake what he's doing with his hat and she says ""okay"" and they go back to filming. [Watch the video here.](https://docketupdates.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ex.-284-Scene-40_2_B.mp4)

1qpw0ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeMyReferenceUSA/comments/1qpw0ee/the_ats_and_nothing_but_the_ats/,The ATS and nothing but the ATS,"ATS stands for Application Tracking System. It is an applicant screening software and nothing new, having been around since the 90s. Fancy large companies used it in the 70s and 80s (used to be crazy expensive), but it became mainstream in the 90s. Cloud and AI versions of it, popped up in the 2000s and as of 2010 errrrrrbody uses it. It is simply a software that checks for keywords in a resume. The high incidence of said keywords determine the suitability of the candidate. 

Every job type has standard keywords. E.g. accounting will have GL accounting, fixed assets, depreciation, ASC 606, revenue recognition etc. An office manager will have keywords such as budget administration, vendor management, facilities coordination etc.

So, when a boomer or overreaching ""lil bro"" tells you to tailor your resume for each and every job post....CALM DOWN. Every industry and job type have their own standard keywords that do not change. You do not need to reinvent your resume for every job posting. In fact, making your resume as bland and standard as possible, will yield higher chances of getting a call from HR. 

Besides keywords, the resume must not have tables. The software doesn't pick up words in tables...I don't know why...but the general consensus is...NO TABLES! List your skills in bullets using tabs. Also, your resume must not be longer than a page! It doesn't matter if you have 30 years experience. Cut down your experience to the past 10 years. Any more than 10 years, and you will be target of ageism. Use headers and margins to cut spaces. Remember, you need to fit as many keywords as you can reasonably can. 

The presence of keywords will flag your resume to the HR person, who will call you for a preliminary screening. 

The preliminary screening is normally by phone, and it is not a formal interview; do not panic. Make sure you sound chippy. Literally smile while on the phone; it will automatically change the pitch of your voice and make you sound amiable. The HR person is verifying that you are not a creep and that you are able of holding a pleasant conversation. They will ask about your work eligibility, a quick overview of your experience, and that's it. It is small talk at the coffee shop. If you suck at small talk....well....it is time to practice.

When it comes to interviews/ice breakers/presentations i loseeee it. i start to freak out.  

Does anyone have the same thing and if so did it help for you?

Next to convenience of location, breakfast is my determining factor for where to stay. Price typically isn’t too much of a concern for business travel so “value” doesn’t get taken too much into account. 

I don’t have a ton of comparisons. I value quality then quantity. I don’t have a ton of comparisons to offer. For what it’s worth:

Philadelphia: Bellevue>Centric. 

Bellevue has always been fantastic for me. No spend limits at either, but I walk around the corner to Starbucks vs. sit at centric due to taste

NYC: Standard East Village > Andaz > Dream > Bowery 50

No spend limits at east village or Andaz but better quality at east village. I’d still go back to Andaz in a heartbeat. Dream was tasty but had a small limit (coffee + breakfast sandwich) and Bowery 50 was coffee only when I stayed.

Airport had massive buffet and MTO omelets without spend limit, Sonoma had small buffet with menu but I don’t remember any limit, Monterey was walk up counter with small menu, some non perishable grab’n’go and no limit. 

D.C.: Park Hyatt > Thompson > Grand. Park was delicious with a spend limit, Thompson was tasty without a limit, grand was unremarkable when I stayed. 

FWIW Regency-wise: similar experiences at Cincinnati, Columbus, Monterey, Morristown where they all had a hot breakfast sandwich mto and ‘market’ available. 

Similar Regency experiences at Rochester, Cleveland, New Brunswick, Baltimore, and Jersey City where it was sit-down focused w/o market option. ",1,1769653255.0,hyatt,7,0.6,False

1qpvqgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Btechtards/comments/1qpvqgh/she_said_she_liked_how_i_thought_i_think_thats/,She said she liked how I thought. I think that’s why it hurt.,"We used to sit in the lab long after most people had left. The lights were always a little too bright, the fans too loud, and the coffee always tasted burnt. Somehow none of that mattered. She sat a few seats away from me, close enough that we’d keep stealing glances at each other’s screens, far enough that it didn’t look deliberate. When she got stuck, she’d stare at the code for a while and then look at me like she was asking a question without words.

We started talking slowly. About assignments first, then about how confusing some lectures were, then about things that had nothing to do with college at all. She once told me she liked how I explained problems out loud, even when I was wrong. Said it felt honest. “You actually think,” she said, smiling. I remember holding onto that sentence longer than I should have.

Third semester changed everything. Deadlines piled up. Everyone suddenly seemed faster, sharper, more confident. I started feeling like I was always catching up. That’s when I began using AI. Quietly. At first just to understand things quicker, to get unstuck. I told myself it wasn’t cheating. Just help. Just survival.

Over time, things became smoother. My answers were clearer. I didn’t hesitate as much. I stopped saying “I think” and started saying “this works.” She noticed. One night while we were packing up, she looked at me and said I’d changed. Not accusingly. Just… observant. “You sound optimized,” she said, half-joking, half-not. I laughed, but something in her tone stayed with me.

A few weeks later, I saw her sitting with him. Front row. Confident. The kind of guy who spoke without pausing, like uncertainty wasn’t part of his vocabulary. At first I brushed it off. College is full of coincidences. But then I noticed how she leaned in when he talked. The same way she used to lean in with me.

The moment that really broke something was accidental. I walked past her seat one evening and caught a glimpse of her laptop. ChatGPT was open. Not casually either. Carefully written prompts. Answers rewritten, polished, made her own. She was good at it. That realization hurt more than I expected. Not because she used AI, but because I suddenly understood how easy it is to compromise when pressure doesn’t let up.

I asked her about him later. She didn’t deny it. She just said he moved fast. And then she gestured at her screen and said, almost apologetically, that this did too. “I can’t afford to fall behind,” she said. There was no fight. No apology. Just an honest sentence that didn’t leave room for anything else.

I still use AI. I still worry about what it’s doing to how we think, how we compete, how we choose. And sometimes I wonder how many of us are quietly making the same trade-offs—speed over comfort, productivity over principle—without really talking about it.

If you’re a BTech student and this feels even a little familiar, I’m trying to understand that feeling better through a short, anonymous academic survey (2–3 minutes).

In my early 30s, woman, and newly separated from my husband of 10 years. Things got to a point that we decided we needed to be apart. I'm really nervous but excited about this new chapter in life. I'm moving alone, I have no friends or family in the area. My new apartment is in Hillcrest, and I start my new job in a few weeks.

San Diego has been on my list for a while, and I chose it for a number of reasons but primarily the sunshine and temperate weather. I think it'll be great for my mental health and allow me to do the things I love. I'm big into running, hiking, swimming and just being outside in general. I love photography, crafting, reading, and journaling. Hoping to pick up a new hobby like pottery or something of the sort once I get settled. I'm also part of the LGBTQ+ community. 

My job is good and pays well but I'm not a corporate ladder type of girl. I'm just out here chasing happiness... hoping to find some new friends and a place to call home along the way.

I'll take any advice, but primarily looking for:

* food & coffee shop recs
* places to run, places to avoid running
   * any run clubs?
* fav hiking spots
* must do events
* groups/clubs I could join
   * how on earth do I make new friends as an adult??
* things I can do alone that wouldn't be too awkward

Super excited to join the community, I promise to do my best to be a person the locals don't hate... I see so many locals being like ""don't move here"" so I'm sorry to add to that, but I need to do it. We only get one shot at life, and I'm trying to make it one I won't look back on and regret. cheers",3,1769652884.0,Moving2SanDiego,10,0.81,False

1qpvkbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/LUCID/comments/1qpvkbo/la_to_park_city_roundtrip_in_gravity_grand/,LA to Park City roundtrip in Gravity Grand Touring: A Report,"Just returned from a round trip to Park City in the GGT, which really was setting up as THE test for me and this vehicle and I have to say the short version: a tremendous success. 

I broke the trip up into two days both ways to make it easy on the body. The first thing I had to do was get a new set of wheels (to get the car quicker I took an off the rack GGT fully specked tech wise and with the 22/23 option). Having already had to replace one of the Pirelli’s two weeks in due to a flat, figured I’d bite the bullet and get a road trip set (21/22 All Season Michelins) and either swap the 22/23’s back on when I know I’ll be city driving for an extended period or when I have to return the vehicle at the end of the two year lease with very little wear and tear, we’ll see. 

The Michelins road like champs and made for a much smoother ride (and only slightly less attractive aesthetically). I’ll share the trip summary in bullet points for ease of reference: 

— Drive out was super smooth and had no major alerts or issues. Had to reboot once after charging simply because a chime I couldn’t diagnose went off and would not silence. Otherwise, every single thing in the car operated as intended, right down to the windows (will get to this in the return trip bullet point). 

— I’m a home charger so this was a new experience for me. I started out hunting Electrify America having heard about the 350kw stations. Despite that listed rating, found myself capped at about 175 on the EA charger the one time I used it. Used Tesla’s network the entire rest of the trip and found it super reliable and easy to use (especially having come from a Model Y). 

— Tesla Charging: Oddly I found the 250kw stations gave me longer charges at the peak of 220kw. The 325kw rated stations also hit 220kw but it took them longer to ramp to 220kw and the time at 220kw always seemed shorter for some reason (likely anecdotal, could’ve just been my luck). And egg on my face but it took me a few stops to remember to check the Tesla app because at least 30% of the stalls at any given station were inoperable. Found charging to 85% to be WAY faster in the Gravity than in my Model Y and it didn’t feel like a time burden at all to stop and charge; I would usually take the dog out for a walk, come back and grab a coffee and hit the road. So chill. 

— Drive back was more buggy. Cruise Control would not engage to save my life (and using Cruise Control on the drive out DID save my life and was rock solid). About halfway back I pulled over and searched through this forum and the Lucid Owner’s forum and found the solution of getting far enough away to allow the vehicle to sleep and voila, all was right. 

— Windows on the drive back were a total pain. The dog was freaking out and occasionally letting down the windows would calm him (BTW even at 85mph with the windows down there is very little drag in this vehicle!). Of course every time I went to put the windows back up they would do that thing where they would go up… and then immediately back down (rinse, repeat). Annoying. 

— I tried Dream Drive a bit on the drive back. It’s fine but, after a few legit scary experiences with self driving in my Tesla, I’m still not ready to trust it. On a straight away in the middle of the desert with little traffic around it’s solid. But that’s about as much as I can trust. 

— Bluetooth Audio really let me down but I assume this is going to be addressed in a big way very soon. Same with the key fob battery which I made sure to replace before handing off to the valet. 

— My charging cap still occasionally needs to be locked and unlocked and relocked and unlocked, clearly a hardware thing but now that I know what it is, I can deal with it just fine (and the damn thing looks and feels like I never had to rip it out of its joint at all =) 

— Got a TON of interested looks every time I charged and a few owners who even came over to chat me up about it. Given how well the car performed I was happy to oblige and sing the vehicle’s praises for once. 

— There was a bit of ice on the ground but only at the roadway edges and very little snow so I can’t speak to that. Battery performed okay in the weather though the efficiency definitely took a dip up there. 

In Summary: I fell in love with the car on this trip and was glad to be reaffirmed in taking the leap on it. Far and away the most comfortable experience I’ve ever had on a road trip of this length and the drive out was total catnip, no alerts, no phantom notifications or rogue operations, just a rock solid product where the software disappeared and the engineering shined. 

I see the new update is releasing imminently. That my experience here will only get better is a great sign indeed. Appreciate the folks on this forum for always engaging and keeping me from the brink.
