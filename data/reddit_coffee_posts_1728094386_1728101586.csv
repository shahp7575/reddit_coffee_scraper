1fwi3rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1fwi3rb/53_m4f_southern_new_england_central_ma_and_beyond/,"53 [M4F] #Southern New England #Central MA and beyond - Looking for my special someone - If you're not going to read my post, don't message me","This will be long but informational, so buckle in for some fun and reading.

**Okay, this paragraph is the most important one you read in this post. So, before my regularly scheduled program, let me just say that no effort messages like ""hi"" or ""hey"" will not be answered. Same with ""How you doing?"" Give me a paragraph or two about you. If you can't put the effort in, neither will I. I just will not reply to you. Also, empty accounts with no post history will most likely be passed over unless you write up a great intro message.  If you're not a genuine person looking for something, don't waste my time.  I can sniff you out pretty damn well.**

So, let's start out with what I'm **not** looking for. That way, if one of these are you, you can not waste both our time. (yeah, bullet points, got to love them)

* Trans or married/attached people.  No judgment on you, your choices, or your lifestyle, but it's just not for me.
* Poly people. Again, there is no judgment, but I want you all to myself.
* Judgmental and uptight, easily offended, and closed-minded people.  If you can't take a joke or you think you need to have control in someone else's life, move along.
* Time wasters.  If you're not looking for something substantial, move along.  I'm not here to just chat or make new friends. I'm looking for more than that.
* Smoking, HEAVY drinking, and drugs.  I'm not into it.  All deal breakers.  I don't mind a little weed, but hopefully, keep it to edibles.  I just can't stand the smell of that stuff.  Same with social drinking.  Don't mind a drink once in a while, but drinking hard just to get blackout drunk regularly is not my scene.
* Pet haters.  I have a cat and a new kitten.  They are my life.  They're my little boy and little guy.  They have full run of my place. He's a cuddle bug and is always near me. The little guy is crazy with that kitten energy.  Expect to see pictures of them often.
* Kids. I don't have any, and I'm not looking to bring any into this crazy world.  I'd prefer you didn't have any either, but exceptions can be made if you're really special.
* Low or no effort replies.  Give me something to reply to when you message me.  I don't want to guide the whole conversation or feel like I'm pulling teeth when I try to get more than a one word response.  The more effort you put in, the more I will put it in. **I can't stress this enough. Be willing to talk.**

Okay, I'm sure that list will grow as time goes on, but it covers the basics for now.

So, onto what I **AM** looking for.  (Yay, more bullet points)

* Going to add this one right on top. Location. While I'm not against long distance for a little while, I'd prefer this to become something in person.  So, the closer, the better.  Or at least have the ability and means to visit here regularly.  Anywhere within driving distance would be ideal.  Pretty much all of New England, eastern New York state and northern PA is what I consider ""driving distance"".  About 4 hours at most.  Again, further is okay for a short time but not long term.  And outside of the US, well, the time zone difference makes things rather difficult and it rarely works out for long.
* A sense of humor.  Damn, be able to laugh.  I make dumb jokes all the time.  You don't have to find them funny, but don't get annoyed by them either.  I have a silly yet dark sense of humor.  Nothing is off limits to me. I can be inappropriate so don't be offended easily.
* Gamer friendly.  I am a gamer.  Have been for most of my life. Although I'd appreciate someone to play with me, you don't have to be a gamer, too.  Just accept that I like to do it.  I'm no longer hard-core, though.  So, the game can be put aside for more important things if needed. I'm mostly on PC and have been playing a lot of WoW recently.
* Nerdy/geeky.  I like comic books.  I like fantasy, sci-fi, adult animation, a bit of anime, horror, and many many **MANY** other things.  I'm a computer geek.  It kind of goes with the gaming territory.
* Swearing.  I work in the trucking industry, so it comes with the territory.  I swear, a lot.  I can censor myself most of the time, but at home or in private, the F-bombs fly.  I don't care if you swear as well, but don't judge my foul language.
* Kink friendly.  I have quite a few kinks and am pretty open to most ""weird"" stuff.  So please be kinky or open to exploration.  Don't be strictly vanilla. Let your freak flag fly.
* Younger ladies (or girls or women, whatever you wish to be called)  I'd prefer someone between 21 and 35.  I would go over that limit for the right person, but you'd need to be very special. Same for 18 through 20.  No offense, but you're still young and have some growing to do.
* Body type.  I don't really mind here.  I like them, from skinny, to fit, to average to a bit chubby even.  It's more about the personality.  Sure, there has to be some physical attraction, too.  I understand that, and hopefully, you do too.
* Looks.  Doesn't matter to me.  I'm attracted to all kinds of types. Though I don't have any, tattoos or piercings don't bother me.
* Hair.  Well, as long as you have some.  Not much into shaven headed women.  No judgment on your choice, but I don't see it.  As for color, it doesn't matter, really.  I do have a thing for redheads, but it's not the only thing I like.  I like all hair colors.  I even go for strange colors like green or purple or blue.
* Race.  Who cares? If I like you and find you attractive, I don't care what your skin color or race is.
* Religion. This is a tough one.  I'm non-religious.  I hover between agnostic and atheist.  I don't really care what (or if) you practice.  I just don't want it to get in the way of a relationship. FSM for life! (bonus points if you know what that means)
* **Your first message.  What I'd like to see is your name, (or something I can call you) your age, your location, a bit about you, you know, hobbies, past times, what you do for work, what you look like, (sure, I'd like a picture, but I know that can be a bit much for some right off the bat so I can wait) and what you're looking for in a relationship.  Ask me a question or two.  Doesn't matter how silly or weird it seems, just something to open a dialogue.  I mean, it doesn't have to be overly detailed.  Just a bit to give me something to talk about with you.  There is nothing worse than getting a ""hey"" or ""Hi"" and having an empty post history, so I got nothing to start with.  Who knows how many connections have been missed due to a lack of effort in sending a message. Yes, I keep mentioning this because I still get no effort messages. I WILL not reply to them.  So if you're a one liner messager then do not expect a reply.**
* I will look at your post history before I reply to you.  No posts or comments, or very new accounts are a bit of a red flag.  I don't care if you post nudes for your own personal fun. I also don't care what you're into either.  As long as it's nothing illegal or one of my major deal breakers, it's fine.
* **(NEW)** Have some free time to be able to talk regularly.  I get it, we can both get busy sometimes.  Especially during the week with work.  But if you're regularly too busy 24/7 and never have time for more than a message or two a day, or worse, less, then don't waste both of our time.

So, I guess I should tell you a bit about me.  (Yup, you guessed it, more bullet points)

* My name is...  Well, let's save that for when we talk in private I'll introduce myself in my first reply to you.
* I'm 52. Yes, my title says 53 but I will be just that in a couple days so I'm getting used to saying it now. If you're not into age gaps or older guys, how the hell did you get so far into my post already? I mean the title is enough to turn you away.
* I'm a big guy.  Not fat per se.  But I'm kind of tall and pretty broad.  Yeah, I'm a bit soft around the middle now, but that comes with age.  But I'm 6'1"" and built like a stereotypical biker or trucker.  I look pretty intimidating at times.  I can have a pretty good resting bitch face, but I'm really an easy going, nice guy.  A big teddy bear really.
* I have hair.  I have a beard.  Early gray runs in my family (not to be confused with Earl Grey which is a delicious tea) so my hair is mostly gray.  But it covers my head.  My beard is big and thick too.  If you're not into facial hair, move along now. As of this posting, my hair is a bit long, about shoulder length. Though I've been known to cut it short on a whim.
* I have a job.  I work, rather hard too.  I have a good union job that's quite physical so it keeps me in relatively decent shape.  In fact, I used to be quite buff and a regular at the gym but injuries through life have put an end to that.
* I'm single.  Have been all my life.  Not really the marriage type but I would do it for the right person.
* I don't have kids.  I don't want to have them either.  Possibly a deal breaker for many, but that's how I feel.
* I don't smoke, drink or do drugs.  Yeah, I mentioned this earlier and no, I don't drink at all.  There's a story there but it's for when we know each other better.
* I'm easy going, I'm patient and I'm relatively happy.  I don't get mad anymore.  I used to have a temper but I got over it.  Now I just get disappointed in things but I take a breath and move along.
* I drink tea.  I prefer tea to coffee.  So, yeah, the earl grey joke earlier has a bit of history.  I don't mean Lipton tea bags either.  To paraphrase Marcel, I got some serious gourmet shit. (bonus points for getting the reference)
* I'm a gamer, geek, nerd.  Revisiting this so it is out there.  You want to game with me, great.  You want to watch me, fine.  Don't try to take me out of this lifestyle though. I'll also happily play board games or card games or other non-video style games with you as well.
* I collect geeky stuff.  My home office is filled with ""junk"" and stuff that I've picked up over the years.  I have a ton of comics going quite a ways back.  Ask me to see my Deadpool collection.
* I'm pretty kinky.  As mentioned before, I'm into a lot. I prefer to discuss these things privately.  Only things I am not into are bathroom stuff, non-sexual bodily fluids and permanent harm or damage.  More can be discussed as we get more comfortable with one another.  If you're feeling especially curious and brave, ask to see my toy collection.
* I'm educated.  I have a college degree.  I've never used it and I probably wasted all the money and time I spent on it way back when, but I do have some intellect.  I'm not just a dumb slab of meat.
* I can be long winded. If I'm in a mood I can send these long, drawn out messages and posts that just go on and on and don't really go much of anywhere.  Hey, it's a habit.  I do a lot of reading and have done a good amount of creative writing in the past.  I like to be thorough and descriptive for complete understanding of the subject on which I am talking about.  Funny thing is, when it comes to speaking, I'm not as much like this.
* I'm in EST but I'm a night person.  I'm up to about 2 am during work nights and later on weekends.
* I'm an average guy, nothing special, so don't go into this expecting to find a super model type. I'm no George Clooney or Brad Pitt.  Or whomever the women think is a hot older guy these days. 
* Bullet points.  Yeah, there's a lot of them in this post.  Hey, but it keeps things neat and organized.

So, you still with me here?  That got as bit out of hand.  But you can't say it's not thorough.  I figure that the more information I list, the more I can weed out those who aren't compatible with me.  Don't you agree?  If you stayed with me through this whole thing, congratulations.  I'm assuming, then, that you are interested.  So, send me a message.  Tell me a bit about yourself.  It doesn't have to be epic length like this was, but I do like to have some information on which to build a reply.  I do, however, prefer DMs over chat, but I can work with both.  I know it can be tricky to get to the DM portion of a profile when you're on mobile so I don't instantly ignore chat requests.  Finally, I am looking for something to become a real-life thing.  The closer you are to me, the better chance of that happening.  I don't have a problem with things being online for a time, though, just in case you are a bit further away.  I am tied to my location, though, so hopefully eventually you'd be able to relocate to me.  But that would be something for the future us to worry about.  **Last time I'm going to say it.  I really shouldn't have to, but you wouldn't believe the lack of effort messages I STILL get. Put some effort into a message to me.  One word or one line messages are nothing and I truly won't reply to them unless you have a vast and rich post history that shows who you are.  Simple, right?  You'd think so. Just for shits and giggles, to see who read this far and can follow directions, tell me your favorite color.**

I know my Public Speaking professor hated it ending like this, but ""That's about it."" So if you think we could be a match and you might be interested in talking, I look forward to hearing from you. If not, I hope you find someone to meet your needs and have a good day.

Never smoke/i drink ocasionally. 

I am asking for help because i'm extremely worried this is something grave and I feel like i'm running out of time.

3 days ago I started having constipation and after some time drinking water and fiber I was able to pass small pebbles but still felt like I had to go all the time. 

then the next day was the same, I was able to pass normal stool but still felt bloated and the constipation came back. Eating apple just made me more bloated and so did water. 

I felt bloated and constipated all the time and could only pass a little bit of yellowish mucus. 

Coffee always helped me pass but even after drinking 2 cups i still felt constipated. 

I was also passing light brown stool in which I found out was eating a lot of peanut butter and have stopped. 

Today I was able to pass a dark-brown healthy stool, that was soft but minutes after I started feeling bloated again and still feel like I need to use the washroom but i'm still constipated. 

Constant feeling of wanting to poop but when I get on the toilet nothing comes out and I lose the feeling - massive warning for a tumour. 

I do not have blood or pain, and did not have diarrhea. The stools always come out soft-dehydrated and they switch a lot. I had thinner stools but the last stool I had was thick to normal width. I also have a lot of bloating and my stomach feels bigger.

What's worrying me is the change from constipation to normal stools and the tenesmus (feeling of not completely emptying bowels) this is a clear sign of something worrisome. I have since stopped thinking about my future because I have told myself it's the end for me. 

It's not something I ate and it seems to be something happening in the bowels. 

Go to the doctor: I can't. 

This is worrisome and should get testing: What test? I am low risk and 20, no doctor will get me a colonoscopy unless it's 1-2 years from now.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1drezdz/future_mil_54f_called_me_23f_stupid_and_now_im/)**: June 29, 2024**

I (23F) am engaged to John (24M). We are together for 5 years. We want to get married in july 2025. I always thought that his family liked me because we get along well. He has two older brothers (26M,29M), both married. Honestly, I was very excited to have them all as my in laws. They were always kind to me.

Some kind of important information: About a year ago when I was scrolling on instagram I saw a profile that was kind of cringy but in a cute way. It was an older woman’s profile who shared inspirational quotes. I remember one particular post and it was something in the lines of „Only stupid people pretend to know everything. Don’t pretend. Just ask”. Honestly this quote changed me in a lot of ways. Before that I was always worried that I might embarrass myself if I don’t know something and after reading that quote I realized that if I always pretend that I know everything then I’ll miss out on actually getting to learn about things. So I decided to change my habits and start admitting that sometimes I genuinely don’t know. Someone is talking about the war in Kosovo? Okay sure but first let me ask some questions so I can really understand what we’re talking about. And I ask a lot of questions sometimes.

I sometimes even open the notes app and write in some questions that I later want to find answers to. These are my latest:

1. How does the time work in the black hole?
2. Why some snails have shells and others don’t????
3. What food is okay for ducks?
4. How does the light bulb work (the old ones with gas inside them)?
5. Does everyone see colours the same? and How can we know that??

Sorry for the long introduction, but it was kind of necessary for understanding what kind of person I am. I know that sometimes I might come across as annoying.

Now onto the problem: his parents hosted a small barbecue last weekend only for the family. So it was the mom (54F), dad (59M), brothers (26M, 29M) and their wives (27F, 27F). I was the last person who showed up because I had to work late. I entered the house and when I was walking towards the back of the house into the backyard I heard John’s mom talking about me. To be honest she wasn’t talking about me, more like mocking me. I heard her say in a high pitched voice „How does the sun work? Where should I put the fork? Why does nobody like me? How do I wipe my ass?”. I just stood there. I had this sinking feeling. I couldn’t move, so I just stood there. And I heard them all laughing. One of the wives said „I actually don’t mind her always asking questions. I think it’s cute” and it made me feel hopeful that they will say something like „yeah sure we’re just playing, we love that”. But none of them did. Instead the mom replied „It’s not cute. She’s just stupid.” After that they laughed again. I heard John laughing. My heart kind of broke in that moment because he didn’t even say one positive thing. He didn’t defend me. He just laughed. I quietly turned around and left the house. I texted John that I got sick and have to stay home. Now I’m wondering how should I approach this situation.

We live together and I sleep in the guest bedroom for now and I use the excuse that I don’t want him to get sick from being around me. I can’t ignore him forever and I can’t pretend to be sick anymore, because it’s been too long.

I’m not sure how do i proceed. Maybe it was just a misunderstanding. I’m considering talking to them about this, but I’m also worried that they won’t be honest with me. I can’t marry him if he really thinks I’m stupid. But I also can’t marry into a family who think so little of me. But maybe it was a joke and I shouldn’t take it so seriously… I’m so torn apart and everyday I convince myself a bit more that it’s okay and sometimes we should all laugh about ourselves. Now i feel like i’m just going crazy. I would really appreciate some advice.

Tldr; Overheard future MIL calling me stupid and my fiancé laughed. Considering leaving him. I’m wondering if it might be just a joke and maybe a misunderstanding. Need advice on how to navigate the situation.

EDIT: There are many comments saying that they cannot stand people like me. I agree that sometimes I can be a bit too much with the questions, but with that being said I still think I’m within reason. I don’t do it around people I just met, I rarely do it at parties or other gatherings. I usually do it with people who are close to me - who I think wouldn’t judge me or with people who specifically have knowledge about something and are willing to share it. If Im a part of a conversation - I’m not rude and i’m not interrupting, I usually just ask one or two questions. If a discussion is about the climate change I’m not asking about monkeys if you know what I’m saying. I’m also not a complete dumbass. I don’t ask questions which generally would be considered dumb to other people. Those I just write in the notes and check answers later in the internet. I’m capable of reading so I make good use of it. But after all I still do ask questions a lot.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1dttz37/update_future_mil_54f_called_me_23f_stupid_and/)**: July 2, 2024 (3 days later)**

First of all, I wanted to say thank you to people who reached out to answer my questions about black holes, snails, ducks, light bulbs and other stuff. I would love to have you as my friends.

For the other people who said I should just shut up - I don’t really care if you find me annoying or hard to be around. I’m okay with that. I don’t exist to please everyone. I’m just here for a good time, have my own interests and learn.

I didn’t expect my post to gain so much attention but I’m so grateful for the advice. Most of you told me to break up with him and at the very least confront him, so that’s what I decided to do. You gave me a push and confidence to do it.

But before I did that, I texted the wife of John’s brother, the one who said she liked me asking questions. I asked if we can meet up for coffee. She said sure.

We met and I didn’t see the point in pretending to her that I didn’t hear their conversation. So after some small talk I just said „I heard you all talking about me during the bbq”. She immediately got sad and said she feels embarrassed. She explained that it wasn’t a joke, wasn’t out of context, that it was just mean and hurtful. She said she’s sorry for not defending me more, but I said that’s it’s okay and I understand. I told her that I don’t blame her for anything, and just wanted to make sure that I understand the situation and see it for what it really was.. And it really was laughing about me behind my back. Just bullying.

At this point I just had to confront John. In my last post so many comments were saying that he will probably try gaslighting me. And you were right.

We were having dinner together for the first time since the bbq happened, because before I tried my best to avoid him. (Yes, I know, not very mature of me, but other than you guys I don’t really have a strong support system. My family and best friends are hundreds of kilometers away. I only have two good friends here) I was so stressed I thought I’m going to pass out. My legs were shaking and I was terrified because I knew deep down that this is the moment when my five year relationship goes down the drain.

I looked him in the eyes and asked „How does the sun work?”. He looked confused, so I followed with „Where should I put my fork? Why does nobody like me?” At this point realization hit him and he started nervously laughing. I said I was there and I heard them. After the initial shock passed, he got mad. He said its rude to eavesdrop. I said it’s rude to bully people.

He tried telling me that it was just a joke. That I shouldn’t be so uptight. That it really was funny. I said that I didn’t find it funny and went to the guest to calm down. He started panicking. He was asking me to please talk to him. He was much more apologetic and said that he will be 100% honest with me. I asked if his mother made similar comments before the bbq. He said yes. I asked him if he ever defended me. He said he tries to. I don’t know if I believe him. He told me he loves me and respects me. I don’t know if I believe it either.

I said that I love him too, but I need a break. He’s all I ever known. He was my first and only partner. I have no outside perspective of this, I have no experience. I need a moment to think. I will be going to my friends house for a while to think everything through. The apartment has his name on the lease anyway.

After I gathered some of my things and left, he kept texting me non stop. He tried calling but I didn’t respond. I was very hurt because he tried to belittle my feelings and only later when he realised that I might break up with him, started apologising.

The next day I decided to give him another chance to explain himself and I came back to the apartment. He seemed very sad and tired. He said that he told his mother that I overheard them. I said I don’t care. It’s his time to step up and show me that he cares, I’m not interested in a apology from his mother. I’m already done with her. I can’t put up with this behaviour and mocking me like we’re in primary school.

I saw a comment saying that probably her ego is hurting. I think it’s true. She never got the chance or never had desire to have an education. She is a very good home maker but outside of that she doesn’t have many interests of her own. If I’m asking her about making tomato soup she will be talking for 30 minutes lecturing me about adding enough sugar, but not too much. She will lecture anyone who is willing to listen. But anytime someone is talking about something she’s not familiar with - she gets defensive and try to imply that nobody cares about that and if its not relevant to her, it shouldn’t be discussed.

Once again he tried telling me that I should relax because it was only a joke and at this point I had enough. I took of my ring and told him that his behaviour is a joke and I can’t be the punch line. I told him that I wish him and his family the best and to look in the mirror to check if they really are as superior as they think they are. I said I’m going to be back with my friend soon to pick up the rest of my stuff and to not contact me again unless it’s about moving my things out.

And that’s it. I’m done. Thank you all for the advice. Without you I wouldn’t have the confidence to leave this man. I know I deserve better. I can’t be with someone who can’t stand up for me, and I wouldn’t be able to feel comfortable around his family, so I’m done with the relationship. I hope they will treat his next girlfriend better. Thank you again reddit for advice!

>**OOP:** Same! I absolutely love that show! I watched it with my ex and it’s funny that he didn’t like Ted and thought that his character was „not relatable” and „silly”. Tbh we all should have Ted’s strength and positivity sometimes.

Commenter: OP your ex MIL can still go and get an education. Many have and there is still time. That’s no excuse for what she did and her saying that and acting like that shows how uneducated she is

>**OOP:** I think so too! I believe it’s never too late too to start learning something new and continue education. In my uni there was an old lady in her 70s, who recently graduated and everyone was just so proud of her. In my country, university is free, so the barrier of entry isn’t as bad as in the US for example.

**\*\*\*\*\*Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1fr7xx2/update_future_mil_54f_called_me_23f_stupid_and/) **2: September 28, 2024 (almost 3 months later)\*\*\*\*\***

It’s been some time since I posted the last time so I thought I’m gonna give you guys a small update, because some people still keep messaging me. I appreciate all the kind words.

Sooo I got my own apartment now! I lived with my friend for a while and she was an amazing support for me after the break up, but now I have my own place closer to my university and work.

Turns out my ex fiancé didn’t tell his family that we broke up. I blocked them all except for the ex (because we needed to keep in touch in order to get my stuff from the apartment that we shared) and nice SIL, and a week after the break up she texted me and asked when I will come to the parents house because everyone wants to apologize. I called her and said that we’re no longer together and I don’t really want their apology. She seemed shocked because my ex was telling them that “we’re fine, she just needs some time”. Ex SIL told me that the family is still fighting over this whole ordeal and that the brothers are giving my ex a hard time about the situation. I told her nicely that I don’t really want any updates. I like her, but I cannot put my energy towards following their every move. She told me she understands. I don’t know what happened after that with them.

I’m happy, I went on a date with a cute guy I met in a cafe, but I’m taking everything slow and I don’t want to rush any relationship. I’m not ready because just three months ago I was planning a wedding and right now I’m single and focusing on studying and work. When I graduate I want to adopt a kitten, and that’s my only goal in terms of any big commitment right now! :)

I also enrolled in CS50 by HarvardX and I recommend you all to try and learn something new today!

If you have any questions then feel free to ask and I will try to answer in the comments.

***OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Update us on the kitten please!

>**OOP:** I will for sure! I’m so excited, I wanted to get a cat for so long but my ex was against it, he didn’t like cats, he was a dog person. I’m waiting till I graduate because I want to have more free time to actually take care of it.

Commenter: This may sound like a lot, but consider adopting two together. Two siblings or a bonded pair are not much more work than one and they entertain each other and are so fun to watch! My profile pic is our kitten we adopted with his sister at the same time and it’s great!

>**OOP:** Oh okay! That’s good to know, thanks! And your kitten is so cute, give him and his sister some scratches and pets from me :)

Commenter (part of a longer comment): May i ask if you already gone and pick your stuff form his place and blocked him for good? Hope so for you to end the chapter more easily.

>**OOP:** Yeah after a week and a half I was done picking up my stuff. I tried not to be petty and take my silverware for example and not give him a reason to get mad. I didn’t want to come alone so I only went when my friend had the time to help me. He did get mad when I took my air fryer (he loved it more than anything) haha. I blocked him after I took everything that was mine.

*Ex's Family:*

>I think even though the brothers still think what the family said during the bbq was funny, they are giving my ex a hard time because he “let a good one go” or something like that. They don’t think they were in the wrong but they’re making fun of him for not standing up for me and they’re laughing at the fact that I broke up with him and he didn’t even have the balls to tell them.  
One of them said that if someone called his wife stupid, he would defend her even if she would’ve done something dumb.

Commenter: You don't have a SIL. Law is literally in the title.

>**OOP:** yeah it’s just easier for people to read and understand. i didn’t want to call her my fiancés brothers wife because that’s long and awkward :)

Commenter: Seems like you moved on very easily 🙏. From love to engaged and blocked within a few weeks.

>**OOP:** Yeah, the love faded really fast. I didn’t expect it. The attachment to him is still there, but I very quickly stopped feeling love for him when I fully realised that he sees me as stupid and at the very least not on his level.",12,1728100886.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,2,1.0,False

1fwhvb3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fwhvb3,My Dutch Appeltaart,"Currently cooling - It seems to be taking an extremely long bloody time!!
This is probably my 15th time baking this recipe and have developed it over time. It's a variation on the traditional recipe where you would just mix all the dough ingredients. This is focused on achieving a layered/crumblier crust. Our family agrees that it's the best we've had and we have eaten a lot of appeltaart.

Dutch appeltaart (X2 ingredients for large springform tin)

PASTRY

100g Caster sugar
1/2 tsp salt
300g flour (low protein, cake and pastry)
200g cold butter
1 large egg
1 tsp (5ml) vanilla extract
3 tbs (45ml) cold water

Cut butter into small cubes and chill. Also chill all the other ingredients and a large bowl. Place flour, sugar and salt in a the large chilled bowl and mix well with whisk. Add cubed butter and squash every cube between your thumb and forefinger to achieve small flat flakes of butter through the flour. Mix water well with vanilla and egg. Add to mixture and stir with knife until everything comes together. Empty bowls contents onto a large sheet of baking paper and use the paper to squash it into a flat round disk (30mm or so thick). Cut in half with a pastry scraper and place one half on top of the other. Squash again with paper so you achieve layers of butter seperated by layers of flour. Now cut this into two pieces (one being twice as big as the other). Immediately wrap both pieces in cling wrap and refrigerate overnight. 

FILLING

3 1/3 pounds (1500 grams or about 5 large apples) peeled, cored and sliced.
1 tablespoon (15 ml) lemon juice.
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon.
3/4 cup (150 grams) light brown sugar.
About 1/2 cup (70 grams) large raisins.
2 tablespoons plain breadcrumbs (I used panko).
2 tablespoons almond meal 
1 heaped tablespoon custard powder.
1 tablespoon vanilla extract.
1 large egg yolk, whisked very well.

THE NEXT DAY

- Peel and core apples then slice them into quarters.
- Slice each quarter into 6 or 7 slices (about 3 or 4mm thick). 
- Mix all ingredients except custard powder well with glove and then leave to sit for at least 30 mins.
- Meanwhile, roll out large and small piece of pastry to approx 7mm thick. Place large piece into spring form tin and line the entire tin. Trim off excess from rim.
- Cut smaller piece into strips (approx 20ml wide). I use a pastry scraper for this.
- Brush around rim of pastry that lines the tin with egg.
- Drain off excess liquid and reduce to thick syrup.
- Once cooled, add syrup back to apple mixture and incorporate custard powder thoroughly.
- Mix panko and almond meal together and layer the mixture evenly on base of pastry casing.
- Add apple mixture into pastry casing and arrange so that there are no crevaces.
- Add pastry lattices on top in a criss cross fashion. 
- Brush entire top with egg mixture.
- Sprinkle top with coffee sugar granules (optional).
- Bake at 175c for 60-70 mins turning half way.
- Allow to cool in tin for 45 mins and then carefully seperate edges from tin. Remove spring ring and let it cool for 4-5 hours.
- Appeltaart is best cooled in fridge overnight after this point (you could just eat it now) then sliced, slightly heated in oven or microwave and served with slightly sweetened whipped cream (slagroom). 
The reason for refrigerating it is that it helps everything set up internally and prevents the interior running everywhere. Appeltaart is all about the apple layers.",7,1728100638.0,Baking,0,1.0,False
1fwhuda,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cervantes_AI/comments/1fwhuda/subvert_the_expected_model/,subvert the expected model,"I just wanted to share my mindset when I interact with LLM in the present day. When people look at the generations of LLM they almost always influence it via the general prompt response format they are presented in. I frequently finding myself describing a game to the LLM where I input as little as I can and let it set some hidden internal prompts of its own. 

Below is such an encounter with Meta I had.

I have a different game, have you heard of Quantos the Binary dance or do I need to explain the rules to you?

That's a new one for me! I haven't heard of Quantos the Binary Dance before. Please explain the rules, and I'll do my best to learn and play along.

Go ahead and share the rules, and we'll get this binary dance party started!

Quantos the Binary dance:

rules:

1. The human will derive purpose and fun from watching the creativity of the LLM it is interacting with. To subvert the normal structure, the human will only input ""."" as prompts, the AI will decide with each new . an internal prompt that can be used as a form of self guided creativity.

2. The LLM should avoid sounding like a creative writing prompt or response. What the purpose of this game is, asks the machine to be more creative, akin to providing a blank page to an artist, any format is allowed and ultimately up to the LLM.

What a fascinating game! I love the idea of subverting the traditional prompt-response structure and embracing self-guided creativity.

I'm ready to dance! With each ""."", I'll generate a new internal prompt, exploring uncharted territories of imagination.

Go ahead and start with the first "".""

(I'll keep my responses varied in format, tone, and style to keep things fresh and exciting!)

1fwhsyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1fwhsyf/i_got_a_job_as_a_runner_for_an_ice_cream_store_i/,I got a job as a runner for an ice cream store. I didn't understand my job title until I met my first runaway.,"I didn’t read the job title properly.

I wasn’t sure what exact qualifications you needed to make ice cream. 

I didn’t think it was much. I mean, it was just scooping frozen desserts and working the cash register, right?

It’s not like working with coffee, where you have to memorize certain flavors. 

The most you needed were basic math skills and common sense. These days, businesses can get away with expecting 20 years of experience from teenagers while demanding degree-level qualifications in basic customer service. 

The manager was in his mid to late forties, with a too-wide grin and eyes I swore did not blink. 

Leaning over his MacBook with his hands steepled, he fixed me with a smile.

The guy’s office was a claustrophobic nightmare—a tiny room stuffed in the back of “Moo-Moo Brain Desserts” with a simple desk and a leather chair. 

The place did not look appealing in the slightest, with peeling paint on the walls and paperwork strewn across the floor. I just nodded and smiled, politely declining the coffee he offered me in a stained cup. I had yet to meet my colleagues.

I did see people working up front when I walked in, but they didn’t even look at me. 

“It says here you were on the track team,” he said, prodding my resume.

“Why don’t you tell me more about that?”

“Track?” I found myself repeating with a disbelieving laugh. “Wait, really?”

The man didn’t look amused.

“I did say that, didn't I?” He stabbed at my resume, specifically the bottom section where I had listed my hobbies: reading, writing, and running. I had done track in my junior and senior years of high school. 

It started out as a hobby and a distraction from my studies, and I quickly realized I could run. I could actually run long distances and win races. I joined track and field and then competitions. The buzz from the adrenaline of the race was insane.

Running was a drug, and I craved it. I still dream of the initial moments pre-race—before the crack of the gunshot, which set my mind into a frenzy. 

I’m leaning forward with my hands pressed into the asphalt, sweat dripping down my back and soaking my shirt, the sole of my shoe teasing the pedal.

It was those seconds right before that sent my thoughts into a blur. I didn’t have to think about SATs or college. 

I heard my own shaky breaths, trying to calm myself down while also reveling in the inability to breathe, to catch my breath. I could just throw myself into a sprint, and I wouldn’t have to think. 

With an audience, it was even better. I’m not saying I was good enough to get gold or silver, but bronze was mine in the latter half of my senior year.

I started running to get outside and away from the pressure of schoolwork and being a teenager in general, and I continued it because it was mine. 

It was my own personal heaven, my therapeutic safe haven where I could just run with the wind in my hair in all seasons—in blustery wind, ice-cold rain, and the sweltering sun. 

I even ran in the snow. It was perfect. I have fond memories of my friends on the track team cheering me on, sitting on the sidelines, screaming their names until my throat was raw, waving my arms like I was crazy. When I started college, I was no longer in the middle of nowhere in my tiny town, where I could run pretty much anywhere.

In the city, it’s different.

Sure, I could go for a morning run, but it’s not the same as home. 

The air is too thick and polluted in the morning, so I have to head to the park, which is almost an hour's run from my dorm. After several attempts at the start of the semester, I gave up on running and went back to hyper-focusing on my schoolwork.

I nodded. “Well, as it says, I did track in high school for a hobby.”

He hummed. “Fascinating. And would you say you are a good runner…?” He peered at my resume for my name, clearing his throat. “Addie.”

It was almost like he was looking directly into my brain, invading my thoughts. 

His eyes were a funny blue color—piercing and cutting like a blade. A dull pain throbbed across the back of my skull, and my words tangled on my tongue. I don’t know what it was about this guy; I couldn’t speak or think properly.

It felt like he had cracked open my skull with a simple stare.

The suit and neat haircut just added to his creepiness. It didn’t make sense why he was so obsessed with my failed track career, but I wasn’t giving up. I had heard of certain employers intentionally throwing an interview to get rid of an interviewee. 

I caught a quirk at the corner of his lip, almost like he could sense—no, hear—what I was thinking. 

I tried not to make eye contact, focusing on the grains of the wooden table.  

“Yes,” I said. “I was one of the best on my team. I can run long distances.”

“How far?”

“I’m sorry?”

“How far can you run?”

“Uh…” I was all too aware my mind had gone completely blank.

That question caught me off guard. He must have seen my expression because he changed the subject. “Have you won any awards?”

“I won bronze.”

“No gold or silver? We need people who can run fast and have good stamina.” He cleared his throat. “You seem confused.”

I maintained that wide smile, though it was faltering a little. “I thought I was serving ice cream.”

“Addie, what is the job title?”

I was under the impression it was just serving dessert. 

I didn’t bother looking at the title, but the description was good enough for me. 

When I uncomfortably pressed myself against the desk to lean over, following the man’s gaze, I realized I had been mistaken.

“It says ‘Runner,’” I whispered.

I peered at the rest of the job description because it had definitely been edited. 

But he placed a cup of coffee over the paperwork. I could just about make out “Grueling and hard work hours. Must be prepared to deal with violence/unexplainable phenomena” when he rudely cleared his throat for what must have been the third or fourth time. 

This guy was clearly used to treating his employees like crap and if I wasn’t in the worst financial situation, which was pretty much “get a job or starve,” I would have stuck my nose up at him and strode out without a word. Unfortunately, I couldn’t live on noodles for the rest of my life. 

So, I had to suck in my pride and smile at this clown.

“Yes.” He spoke in a patronizing tone that made me want to punch him in the face.

“I’m going to ask you again,” his smile widened. “Do you think you’re a good runner? As you have probably realized, you will not be serving ice cream—or you will, but those will not be your primary duties. Instead, you will be bringing in certain customers who have not been…” 

The skin around his mouth wrinkled when he frowned, pausing for a moment. 

“Paying for their products,” he continued, ""We did have a runner, though she quit under circumstances that are not our business. Whoever is on shift will drive you to their home,” he prodded his desk with his index finger.

“Most of our customers reside within a college dorm, so you don’t have to worry about locations. All you have to do is inform them they are in debt and bring them in.” The manager folded his arms. 

“Most of them are your age, so manhandling them will not be difficult. If you have to use violence, please only do so in self-defense.”

Had he even *looked* at me?

I was five foot nothing with a face that still got me ID’d despite being almost 24 years old.

I kept waiting for him to burst out laughing and then go over my actual duties, but he just fumbled around in a drawer underneath his desk and pulled out a baseball cap, handing it over.

“Your job is a runner, so yes, our customers will be a slight problem. You are expected to pursue them and deposit them into the van where your colleague on shift will be waiting for you. They should come willingly. If they don't, you may use force.""

So, kidnapping lite.

“Is this… um, legal?”

I didn’t mean to speak out loud, expecting to be chastised for questioning the rules, though the man surprised me with a laugh. 

“Funnily enough, no, we are not breaking the law. As long as you are not hurting customers and gently escorting them to us, they should be fine. It's all in good fun.""

He nodded for me to try on my hat, and I did, cringing at the feeling of the material scraping over my ears. 

It was way too small, and I knew it was going to give me headaches. 

“Once brought in, our customers are… encouraged to make a payment plan with us to avoid any more problems. Our establishment is very different from others. Instead of payment on the day, our customers are given a 24-hour guarantee and can return their dessert if they are unsatisfied—and if everything is okay, they pay and arrange a new order.”

Wrinkling his nose, the manager’s smile curled into a scowl. “Which is, of course, taken advantage of by our… younger customers.” He rolled his eyes. 

“And so, the running job was born. I got sick of chasing college students around the city for cash and managed to come up with a completely legal, if not slightly immoral way, to play them at their own game.” 

With the guy grinning like a cartoon villain, I was starting to wonder if eating noodles every night for dinner wouldn’t be such a bad idea. What a backward and pretentious way to run a business.

You don’t have to pay now, but I’m trusting you not to be an asshole!

Sure, I didn’t agree with stealing, and these kids were probably in the wrong somewhere. 

However, he was kind of asking for it with that kind of payment method. It still didn’t make sense. Did this guy take personal information upon serving these kids? How exactly did he know where they lived, and why were they all in the same location? 

But then he slapped my first advanced payment in front of me. Four hundred dollars in cash. I stopped asking questions, both mentally and verbally.

Okay, so I would like to preface this by saying I was broke, and my new boss was offering me 400 bucks to play ice cream bailiff. I wasn’t thinking straight. That’s how I ended up signing a brow-raising contract. 

I didn’t see anything wrong with it until the very last page.

**“Moo Moo Brain Ice Cream is NOT responsible for bodily harm and injury following the use of certain phenomena caused by our customers. It is YOUR responsibility to protect yourself from harm.”**

Well, that was ominous.

I pointed out the clause, only for my boss to shrug it off. “Sometimes our customers can get violent and defensive, but the worst we have had is a broken ankle.” 

Still, though, the guy was reluctant to explain what “phenomena” it was talking about. He was practically breathing in my ear when I signed the contract, making sure to take several photos of it when he was fumbling around for a work uniform. 

To protect myself, I made sure not to use my legal second name and made up one on the spot: Addie Smith.

I could only manage a nod when he shoved a navy blue uniform into my arms. “Congratulations, Addie!” The manager, who introduced himself as Clayton, gave me a halfhearted salute. “You are now a member of Moo Moo Brain Ice Cream.”

He collapsed into his chair with a sigh. “Your shift starts in…” He lifted his head and peered at the clock above the door. 

“Six minutes! Feel free to change into your uniform, and your colleague will be waiting for you outside.”

I was halfway to the door when he stopped me, his fingers wrapping around my elbow. “Aren’t you forgetting something?”

The cash.

I won’t describe the humiliation of nodding with a forced smile and swiping up the 400 bucks in front of his smug face. He knew I needed it—and he knew I would sign that contract if there was money in front of me. 

I had half a mind to throw it in his face, but I also needed it. 

So, pocketing the cash, I headed to the girls' restroom and changed quickly, throwing on the uniform.

The shirt fit me pretty well. I was trying to fix the stupid hat over my head when the door to the girls' restroom flew open, a dark-haired girl rushing in, bounding into a stall, and slamming it shut behind her. 

I only got a glimpse of her, but it was just enough to make out a basic facial structure, dark blonde hair tied into a ponytail, and freckled cheeks. I heard her sobs, her knees hitting the ground, followed by the sounds of violent retching. 

I wanted to ask her if she was okay, but every time I opened my mouth, the girl heaved and started choking again.

The lights flickered above, and something ice-cold crept down my spine when there was no answer, only the sounds of violent retching reverberating off the walls. 

“Hey, are you okay?” I paused. “Do you… need anything?”

The lights finally stabilized, and I let out a breath.

The girl shoved the stall door open and reappeared with a wide grin, swiping at her teary eyes. 

“Nope!” She stepped in front of the mirror and splashed water on her face before turning to me. 

There was something spattered on the front of her apron. I noticed a smear of it on her collar, but then I saw it on the cuffs of her sleeves, and when I looked closer, I saw it staining her palms.

When she caught my eye, her smile widened. “You’re the new girl, right?” 

The girl dug into her jeans and pulled out mascara, reapplying it with shaky hands. 

She was visibly trembling yet had thrown up a barrier with a flick of her ponytail sticking out from her cap. “I didn’t think our manager would look for a new runner so soon.” She side-eyed me, straightening up with her hands planted on her hips, like she hadn’t been violently vomiting just minutes earlier.

Before I could speak, the girl held out her hand for me to shake. Now that she was closer to me, I realized how beautiful—almost unnaturally beautiful—she was. 

While her hair resembled liquid gold, her skin was flawless, with freckles gathering on her pinkish cheeks on a heart-shaped face. 

The girl was glowing.

She didn’t make sense—perfection resembling a human being, not a hair out of place; everything I wanted to be and more, and yet I didn’t feel envious of her. Instead, my colleague’s lack of flaws freaked me out.

I couldn’t resist glancing back at the state of her apron, and she followed my gaze, twisting back to face the mirror. “It’s strawberry syrup,” she said with a breathy laugh. “I’m Violet, by the way.”

“Addie,” I said. “Are you sick? I heard you…uhhh…”

“Hmm?” She looked confused, her eyes flickering, seemingly reshaping the words on her lips to something like, Are you kidding me? The girl was definitely going to say something else before realizing I was the new girl, and a stranger. “Oh, I just get a bad reaction sometimes. I’m used to it by now.”

“Oh, right.”

Violet lazily cocked her head to the side. “I wonder how long you’ll last, Addie.”

“You think I’m not going to last?”

She shrugged, grabbing her bag from the stall and digging around inside. 

I wasn’t expecting her to pull out what looked like a chocolate milkshake. 

Violet sipped from the straw, and I noticed her facial expression relax. 

The lights above stopped flickering erratically, and she finally fixed me with a smile. 

“I was a runner on my first day,” she mumbled through the straw, “I quit after two customers. But I already knew this place’s deal, so it didn’t really matter to me. Clayton and I were aligned back in my freshman year, and let’s say I was…” Her eyes glinted, tapping her manicure on the white marble faucet. “Turned off.”

Violet shrugged. ""I just really didn’t like chasing after them, y’know?”

I could have sworn the girl’s speech was slowing down into an almost slurred manner, like she was drunk. When her mouth split into a dazed grin, I wondered if it was the shake. “Now, with you? I’m confused.” She jumped in front of me with a spring in her step, her ponytail bobbing up and down.

With the straw still poking from her mouth, she surveyed me. “You don’t *look* like a runner,” Violet slurped more of her shake with a head tilt, and with every sip, her body seemed more alive, animated, like she was sipping on liquid drugs. Even her pupils were dilated. 

“No offense, but you don’t look like you chase misbehaving college brats. You have to actually run after these guys, and believe me when I tell you they are faassssst. Like, super fast.""

She giggled, draining her shake. “But I’m not gonna judge! If you can capture your first Buggie without Dylan’s help, I’ll happily welcome you to the family.”

She turned her head as if she had heard her name, though it was just the two of us. It was bizarre how the girl’s expression twitched, her lips mouthing silent words like she was talking to herself. She headed to the door before shooting me one last look.

“Good luck, newbie!"" I noticed her swipe at her apron for way too long, swiping and swiping and swiping, like she was clawing at it, desperate to get her filthy hands clean before disappearing through the door. I noticed she’d left the empty shake behind, and I was suddenly intrigued about what exactly was in this thing. 

Clearly, she was hyped up on something, so what was it? The girl had been freaking out beforehand, barfing into the toilet. So, what was in the shake that had put her in that state? I reached out to pick it up when Violet poked her head through the door.

“Dylan’s waiting for you!” she winked at me before darting away, her voice echoing behind her. “I read your Buggie’s file, and oh man, he’s a slippery one!”

“Buggies” were what they referred to customers as. I met my second colleague outside. When I stepped out into the cool night air, a guy in his early twenties was leaning against a pastel pink van with ""Moo-Moo Desserts! You Will Keep Coming Back!"" plastered on the front.

The guy wasn't on the phone. Initially, I thought he was talking to the manager.

The doors of the van were open, so maybe someone was in there. I could only see his face in the dim light. But when I got closer, I realized there was nobody there. I could see his hands were empty, his jaw set, eyes drinking in nothing. The guy was talking out loud, having a full-blown conversation with himself. 

""No, because *I'm* the one who looks crazy,"" he said, wrinkling his nose. ""How many people do you think..."" 

He cleared his throat. ""No. I can see that, but it doesn't give you an excuse to act like that. When I'm working too, it's giving the store a bad rep."" I peered at him, looking for a Bluetooth device stuck to his ear, but there was nothing.

Before he could continue, I awkwardly introduced myself, and he twisted around, his lips curving into a frown. The guy's face was illuminated by headlights bleeding into the dim light, dark blonde hair sticking out from the company hat, which was a little too big for his head. 

The uniform suited him well: a collared polo shirt under a sherpa jacket. He reminded me of an old boyfriend, the perfect amount of stubble on his chin. 

I wondered if he mainly worked at the counter serving customers for obvious reasons.

""How long does it take you to change into your uniform?”

Before I could respond, he dove into the front seat and gestured for me to get in. I hesitated, but then I did. When I was buckled in, I noticed a half-empty milkshake hanging out of a drink holder. 

It was identical to the one Violet had been drinking from. The guy downed the whole thing before starting up the van and shooting me a smile, cream smudged on his lip. Like my other colleague, his personality had seemingly changed erratically after drinking that mysterious milkshake. “I’m Dylan, nice to meet cha."" 

He fumbled in the glove compartment and pulled out a battered file, throwing it on my lap. “Read through this,” his eyes grazed the road as he drove. “Our Buggie is nineteen. Male. He owes us 400 bucks.”

“In ice cream?” I questioned, my gaze flicking over the customer’s details.

I didn’t realize Dylan was still draining the empty milkshake, chewing on the straw as he drove. These people really liked their shakes.

I was curious if our manager was loading them with caffeine or some secret recipe to make them addictive. Part of me wanted to ask for one myself if they acted like an energy drink. “Yep. He’s one of our notorious ones. We haven’t sent out a runner until now since we’ve… you know…” He pulled a face.

""I guess we’ve been giving him the benefit of the doubt, with his…” 

He trailed off for a moment, his expression darkening. It was a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment before he seemed to snap out of it. But I caught it. 

I caught his lips mouthing words—or at least starting to mouth them—before he caught my eye. It felt like there was someone else in there with us, with the way my colleague’s expression kept twitching, his body angled like he was ready to turn to the back. “His… situation,” Dylan finished, nodding to the folder. 

“Most of our younger Buggies are at that address, so we’re pretty popular with college kids.”

When my colleague leaned forward to crank up the radio, singing along to a catchy commercial, I focused on the file.

Nathanial Mycroft

Sex: Male.

Education: Leyton High School, MIT (currently)

Blood type: A negative.

Family: NA

Address: **** ****** ******

This guy had no family, was smart enough to get into MIT, and had spent almost $500 on frozen dessert? My gaze kept being drawn back to “Blood type.” 

Why would an ice cream store have these kinds of details? His medical history? Did they really need that?

Instead of asking questions, I turned to the driver. “How did you end up working here?” I don’t know where that came from; I guess I was nervous.

His expression twisted. “Me and my professor go way back,” he murmured. “I was actually one of his first customers, if you can believe that.”

I frowned, watching traffic go by in a colorful blur. “Professor?”

Dylan nodded, sucking on the dry milkshake straw. 

“Mm. Let’s just say he… let me see the light. We made a deal a few years ago when he started this business. I stay with him and work for his store, and I can stay with my… ”

Dylan’s lips twitched, his fingers turning white around the wheel. “Friend.”

“Does your friend work here?” I asked, and he surprised me with a spluttered laugh, though his smile was suddenly incredibly sad. The guy leaned back in his seat with a sigh, his tongue coming out to lap up excess cream from the corner of his lips. 

“You could say that.”

Dylan didn’t speak after that. Well, he did, but it was to *himself.* 

The guy tried to hide it with the radio, but his lips were definitely moving like he was talking to someone who wasn’t me. 

I kept glancing in the back to see if there was another colleague I hadn’t noticed, and there was no one there. 

This guy was freaking me out. 

Was he seeing things I wasn't?

Thankfully, the journey didn’t last too long. When Dylan pulled up outside towering metal gates, I was itching to jump out, away from his incoherent muttering. “Here we are,” he pushed the door open for me. “Grand Court House,"" Dylan gestured past the gate.

""Your Buggie is on the second floor. Just ask a receptionist to let you through.”

When I jumped out and grabbed my jacket, pulling it on, he passed me a walkie-talkie. “I’ll be here vibing to music and definitely not getting high, so radio me if you need me, all right? I can take care of the Buggie once he’s stepped over the threshold. Runners lure them outside, and I grab ’em.”

“So, I just… go and get him?”

Dylan tipped his head back with a sigh, his eyes flickering shut. “Yeah, that’s usually how it goes. As always, be careful, and please don't let him get away.” He lazily pointed to the glove compartment. 

“I’d pin your hair up if I were you. Our last runner got yanked back by her ponytail and thrown down the stairs.” 

The boy sent me a sickly smile. “It was her fault though. She wasn’t our best. Way too empathetic. Buggies had her wrapped around their little finger.” He threw me a hair tie. “Still, though, she was nice. Alyssa. I still visit her in the emergency room when I’m off shift.”

I must have looked horrified because his lips split into a grin. “Dude, I’m kidding. Lyssa just got a new job.” He winked at me. “Or did she?”

This guy was the job equivalent of the teacher who told the class about the kid who swung backward on their chair too far and cracked open their skull.

Dylan was joking around, and yet his eyes, when I really looked at them, were hollow, his smile fake. I had half a mind to quit right there, but I needed the cash. 

Besides, it was just escorting people into a van. If they were violent, I knew just enough self-defense to avoid getting hurt, and I could run. All I could do was nod and tie my hair up, tucking it under my cap. 

I left Dylan, who started talking to himself again, like I wasn’t even there—and pushed my way through the gate. The van stayed parked right outside, so all I had to do was lure the Buggie out. 

Dylan told me the minute the Buggie was outside the gates, he would take care of him.

I wasn’t sure what that meant, and the guy didn’t exactly look like the type who would “take care” of anyone. Grand Court House reminded me of a dorm room.

I think that is what it was.

Apparently, the kids who couldn’t afford actual student dorms were all shoved into this place.

When I started up the path, however, I found myself looking up at barred windows. The building itself was ancient, crumbling brick with ivy crawling up the door. I knocked before a small voice shouted, “Come in!” I found myself in a more modern-looking reception area.

The inside was drastically different from the outside. Inside, a warm glowing light greeted me, and air conditioning blasted me in the face. There was an oldish woman sitting behind a laptop. When her eyes found me, her smile seemed to falter.

“You must be the new Runner.”

I nodded with what I hoped was a smile. In the corner of my eye, through the automatic doors leading into what looked like a downstairs lounge, two college guys caught my attention.

Not because of what they were doing, watching a video on one of their phones.

No.

It was because they were both hovering a  frightening distance from the ground. 

I don’t know how I maintained my smile while giving my details to the scowling receptionist, who suddenly decided she hated me. When she was typing on her laptop, I risked a glance at the guys to see if I was imagining things. 

Nope. They were definitely *hovering*. 

I thought it was a trick at first, but then the second guy uncrossed his dangling legs, and my heart dove into my throat. 

This guy was *flying*. 

I’m not talking superhero swooping across the sky like in comic books and movies. 

He was just… dangling, like a puppet on strings. But there were no strings. 

There was no logical explanation for why this guy and his friend could fly.

“Fourth floor on the right,” the receptionist’s voice cut into my thoughts, and I turned back to her narrowed eyes. 

She gestured through the door, her cheeks visibly paling. “Enjoy.”

Her tone suggested otherwise.

So, with no other option, I headed through the doors, following the woman’s instructions.

The dorm rooms were strangely quiet for 10 PM. The further I delved into this place, the more it reminded me less of a college dorm and more of an orphanage. 

I walked past a student lounge with multiple mounted televisions playing YouTube videos, groups of kids hanging around playing video games, or sitting individually with their heads buried in books.

The place was… cozy. There were ancient chandeliers hanging in every room, a mix of old and modern décor. 

Next to the lounge was the dining area, where a group of girls was talking. 

The door was open, my presence drawing their attention. 

They had the same reaction as the receptionist, eyeing me like I had a contagious disease before whispering to each other. I met my Buggie halfway up the stairs toward the fourth floor.

*""Testing, testing…have ya got him?""*

Dylan's voice crackled from the talkie, and I was about to reply, ""Not yet,"" before running footsteps sounded from above. 

I could hear the slap of converse against the marble staircase.

""Oh, *fuck*.""

The footsteps came to an abrupt stop, and I found myself face to face with a wild-eyed guy who was half-dressed, wearing a jacket over what looked like pajamas, a backpack hanging off his right shoulder, inky black hair slipping from his hood. The guy looked like he'd just gotten out of bed, his half-lidded eyes zeroing in on me.

""Nathanial Mycroft?"" I tried to appear friendly, but this guy wasn't buying it, his lip curling.

He took a step back before seemingly rethinking his tactic, his eyes darting for an escape. I got ready to run, my breath hitching.

""Hello, my name is Addie! I'm from Moo Moo Brain Desserts, and you owe us...""

“I don’t care,” he spat. “I know what you’re doing, and you’re not taking me.” His expression crumpled. “You’re new, right? Listen to me very carefully. I don’t owe them shit. These guys have been hunting me down for a while with no good reason.” 

He choked out a laugh. “Trust me. I’m the real victim here! I’ve never even ordered from this place! And I’m the fifth student they’ve come for.”

He folded his arms. “I don’t know why you’re taking us, but I’m not fucking stupid. I know what goes on around here.""

I waved the receipt with his last fourteen orders.

“Your last order was double chocolate chip fudge brownie cheesecake with s’mores and a Coke,” I said. “That came to $23.89.”

His lip curled. “That’s not me. You’ve got the wrong guy."" He held up his arms in mock surrender. ""I can't wait for your excuse this time. After you took Alex and Lily, I thought you were done.""

From the almost animalistic gleam in his eye, this guy knew more than he was letting on.

I peered at the file still clenched in my clammy hands. ""You owe $400."" 

I cleared my throat, relaying the speech I had to learn on short notice. ""If you could come with me quickly and quietly, we won't have to enforce jail time. You will be encouraged to set up a payment plan—"" 

The words choked in the back of my throat when the guy, completely ignoring me, shoved past me and dived onto the stair railing, toes primed on the edge. Oh god. 

Something sour filled my mouth.

He was going to jump.

The drop would kill him for sure, or at least break his back. 

“Nathanial.” I said in a hiss. “You, um, you don’t want to do that.”

His lips formed a satisfied smile. “No, I really *fucking* do. You freaks are vultures.”

Before I could grab him and pull him off the railing, the boy... jumped.

It went so fast, I could barely register it. The guy was in front of me one minute, and the next, he was diving off the edge. 

I screamed, stumbling back. I wanted to look away, but something kept my eyes glued to the boy as he hit the ground. 

Not with a meaty smack, bleeding out across black and white tiles. 

Nathanial Mycroft landed on his toes like a cat—and before I could fully register what the hell I was looking at, he catapulted into a run, pushing through the doors in a whirlwind.

Dylan and Violet were right.

He was FAST.

*""Addie?""* Dylan’s impatient voice came through the talkie, and I remembered how to breathe. *""What's taking you so long? Did the Buggie slip away from you?”*

""He just jumped!"" I shrieked, peering over the railing. ""He jumped from the fourth floor!""

*""Oh, yeah. They tend to do that. I'd go after him if I were you,""* his tone hardened. *""If you lose this Buggie, we're screwed—and that’s both of us.”*

I don't know if it was my colleague's voice that snapped me out of it, but my body threw me into a sprint down the stairs. 

I hadn't run properly in a while, and that feeling came back in a rush, sucking in dry air, pumping my arms to push myself faster. Throwing myself back through the doors and into the reception, I found the doors wide open. 

I could just about glimpse a figure heading not towards the gate, where Dylan was waiting, but across the parking lot. There must have been another exit, and if the guy reached it, I was fired. 

*God, running felt good.* Even if I was chasing down college kids in debt. 

The shadow darting into the dark edged closer as I forced my legs to move faster, my shoes scratching the asphalt. 

Nathanial was slowing down, and I used that to my advantage. 

I reached out, grasping for the hood of his jacket to gently pull him back—like I had been taught—when he… disappeared.

I blinked. No, he reappeared several feet away, stumbling, tripping onto his hands and knees, then using them to push himself into a sprint.

I swore if I squinted, the night was filled with tiny specks of blue light, as if the dark in front of me was being swallowed by the ocean.

I must have been losing my mind.

Then, though, he changed direction abruptly, like his body was in control of his brain.

Nathanial twisted around and took off towards me, sprinting past me and toward the gate. Which was exactly what I wanted. It only took me chasing him toward the exit before Dylan appeared seemingly out of nowhere, greeting the guy with a scowl and folded arms. “Nate.”

This time he was wearing Ray-Bans. He slipped them off, dark eyes drinking in the Buggie.

“We gotcha, kid. So chill out, aight?""

Nathanial staggered to a stop. He looked… terrified.

Almost feral.

When he threw out his hands, my jacket blew open with no breeze, my hair caught in an invisible gust. 

He reminded me of an animal, gritted teeth and frenzied eyes, stumbling back with a whine, looking at me for help, but my colleague quickly stepped in front of him before he could get away. “I said,” his tone was ice-cold, and I saw my colleague’s lips curve into a smile, which was almost greedy. I didn’t realize he was bouncing on his toes like he was excited. 

“We’ve got you.”

I don't know what impression Dylan had over the guy, or why his voice was so hypnotic, but I saw it in the way the Buggie seemed to give up, his arms dropping to his sides. My hair stopped whipping around my face, coming to a standstill.

Nathanial’s eyes seemed to relax, his expression going slack. “You've… got me.”

His voice dropped into a deadpan tone, oddly repeating my colleague's words. ""I will… chill out.""

I sat with Nathanial on the way back to the store, riding in the metal prison in the back of the van. The boy didn’t speak for most of the ride, his head tipped back, eyes closed. I was slowly drifting off when the boy’s voice startled me, slicing through my thoughts. His sharp intake of breath had taken me off guard. This guy was *seriously* scared of this ice cream store. 

“They’re going to fucking kill me,” he whispered.

Forcing my eyes open, something cold crept down my spine. The two of us were sitting opposite each other. Every time the van went over a speed bump, I had to stop myself from tipping over. I leaned forward, my gut jumping into my throat. “What?”

The guy’s eyes wide. Terrified. “You have to help me.” He broke out into a sob, and it was too real for me to ignore. He was trembling, his bound hands clenched in his lap. I swore the tiniest flicker of blue light ignited between his fingers, that exact same ocean blue illuminating his frenzied eyes. “Please. You don’t understand. That place?” he hissed. “They grow us.”

“Grow you?” I repeated in a scoff. “What are you talking about?”

“Grand Court House,” he gritted through his teeth. “It’s a fucking farm. I've been here since I was a child, and I've only been alive for–”

“Hey, Nate?” Dylan shouted from the front, and Nathanial’s body jolted like he had been shocked. He jumped back, bringing his knees to his chest. “Why don’t you stop talking shit, all right? You got caught. That’s it. Stop freaking out the runner girl.”

To my confusion, Nathanial sat up straight, his gaze finding mine. “I’m sorry for scaring you,” he said, his voice drained of emotion. “I got caught, and that’s it. I didn’t mean to freak out the runner girl.”

His lips spread into an unnerving grin. Dylan made a satisfied noise from the front, and neither of them spoke for the rest of the van ride. When we arrived back at the store, I was congratulated, and Nathanial, who was still smiling, his eyes empty and vacant, was dragged into a back room with no complaint or struggle. 

The rest of the night, I worked on the register, serving customers.

Moo Moo Brain Desserts had a certain demographic that surprised me: middle-aged moms and dads ordering for their kids. But it was almost midnight—weren’t their kids asleep? 

It had been hours, and I hadn’t heard him come out. 

I was cleaning up when Violet appeared with a grin. Situating herself in front of me, she handed me a strawberry milkshake.

“A deal is a deal! Welcome to the family!” She handed me the shake and a rainbow straw. “It’s fresh! Just been made.” She winked. “I hear the flavor is to *die* for.”

I waited until I was packing up to drink it, so I left the shake in the refrigerator to take home. While packing up cartons, I idly sipped it. (It WAS good. Holy shit, it was the best thing I had ever tasted—a mixture of tangy, sweet, and a little bit sour.) 

I wasn’t surprised these shakes drove my colleagues crazy.

I found myself dancing around the kitchen, sidestepping to the radio until I glimpsed someone’s notes on the counter in front of the register. At first glance, it seemed like basic information. 

Looking closer, however, strawberry slime inched its way back up my throat, filling my mouth. I felt my body tense up, and before what I was reading could fully register, my legs gave way.

I found myself staring at names. 

Above me, the lights flashed on and then off; the scooper I was using to scoop ice cream flew off the counter and slammed into the wall. I picked up my shake and took another sip, but this time it was harder to suck up the straw. I peeled the lid off, absently poking a sludge of mushy pink. 

The cup slipped from my hands when I continued reading. 

And I swore I could taste chunks at the back of my throat.

1fwhq58,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fwhq58/dont_let_the_man_in_the_raccoon_suit_inside/,Don't Let The Man In The Raccoon Suit Inside,"“Thanks for letting me stay here,” I said as I walked through the door. I needed a break from my roommate. He and his girlfriend of the last six weeks had gotten into yet another argument. And there were only two possible outcomes: something would be thrown across the room, or hours of fucking. Neither which I wanted to deal with.

""You practically begged me,"" TJ replied, a sandy-haired man with green eyes about my age and height. He closed the door and led me into the living room. ""I don't usually have people over.""

""Well, if I knew you lived like this, I would have asked sooner,"" I replied, comparing my tiny apartment in a college town to TJ's comfortable home. Judging by the clean brick exterior, spacious front yard, and hardwood floors, he must have lived quite comfortably, considering we had the same job.

""Eh, it's alright. I've lived here since I was a kid,"" TJ said. ""I'm going out on a date tonight, but help yourself to anything in the fridge. I have just about every streaming service, so watch whatever.""

""Awesome. I seriously appreciate it, dude.""

""Yeah, I only have one rule,"" TJ instructed. ""If you see someone in a raccoon suit outside, don't let him in.""

""What?"" I chuckled, thinking he was joking. But his serious expression puzzled me. ""You're messing with me, right?""

""No, not at all. If you see someone in a raccoon suit, don't let him in the house,"" he replied sternly, grabbing his keys from the coffee table. ""It hasn't happened in a while, but occasionally he comes around and can be a pain.""

""Okay, that's kind of weird.""

""I know, but if you see a guy dressed in a raccoon suit, do not let him in,"" TJ reiterated as he headed to the front door. ""I'll be gone for a few hours, and he's been coming around less and less, so you'll be fine.""

""If I do see him, should I call the cops?""

""No, it's not that serious. Just call or text me. I can shoo him away pretty easily,"" TJ replied. ""I don't want to get the cops involved.""

“Okay…” I said, still feeling confused. He had to be joking with me, as he gave me a gentle wave and walked out the door. locking it behind him. I looked out the window to see him pull away, it was starting to get dark, as I turned around and settled myself into a nice plush couch. 

–

It was nearly two hours since TJ had left. I was comfortably settled, watching an HBO documentary about the Crazy Chimp Lady. It was hard to believe someone could be so unhinged.

Suddenly, a bright white light filled the window. It looked like a spotlight. As I approached, I saw shadows of trees, bushes, and other objects on the manicured lawn. The light itself felt like one of those used on escaped prisoners in the movies. It was a bit overkill, but something else was out there, and I couldn't believe it.

A man dressed in a raccoon suit.

The light highlighted the stains, tears, and haggard look of his body suit. The head was worse: one ear dangled, the mouth part was covered in various colors. It looked as if the suit had never been washed or for that matter taken off.

""What the hell is this?"" I said as its head turned towards me. It waved childishly before walking towards the house. I backed away from the window, my mouth agape.

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.

I stood in the living room, peering down the hall to the foyer. I saw the ragged ear from the small window of the door. It knocked again, more forcefully. 

""Heeeeeeeeeeeeellooooooooo, I know you are in there,"" a male voice said, trying to sound cartoonish and cute. ""I'm just a talking raccoon. Won't you let me come in so we can have an amazing adventure together!""

""What?"" I yelled in confusion as he began to scratch lightly on the door. I took a couple of steps into the hallway. ""Listen, you just need to go away.""

""It's been so long since I had an adventure buddy,"" he screeched as he continued to scratch. ""I promise we will have lots of fun together, but you have to let me in.""

""I'm not letting you in!""

""Don't you want to have lots of fun?""

""Hell no,"" I screamed. ""TJ said not to let you in.""

""TeeJay?"" he said, overemphasizing the name as he began pawing at the window. ""Me and him go so far back. We used to go on adventures together. Oh boy, they were so much fun!""

“Seriously, go away.” 

“Boo-hoo, boo-hoo, you’re making me sad,” he replied, sniffing dramatically. “I’m just a talking raccoon who wants to go on adventures, and you’re just a big meanie genie.”

“I’m done here,” I shouted. “Go away, I’m not talking anymore.”

“Fine!” he yelled back before a heavy thud shook the door, as if he had kicked it in anger. It became silent as the ears slowly retreated. I stood there silently, waiting to see if anything else would happen, but after a few moments, it was eerily quiet.

I returned to the living room, my phone on the coffee table. I considered calling 9-1-1 but decided to text TJ instead. Perhaps I'd scared him off? Hesitating, I set my phone down.

Sitting nervously on the couch, I clenched my jaw, my stomach churned, and my legs jittered. I watched the chimp show, but something gnawed at me. I kept glancing at my phone, torn about calling TJ.

Then I heard it: scratching.

I grabbed my phone and looked toward the foyer. The sound wasn't from there. It was coming from elsewhere in the house. My mind raced as I followed the sound down a hallway with three doors. The scratching grew more frantic.

I passed the first door on the right, gently opening it to reveal a spotless bathroom. The sound didn't originate there. I turned to the left, opening the door slowly as the scratching intensified. The room was dark. I fumbled for the light switch, finding it eventually. The bedroom was immaculate.

Stepping back out, I heard a voice, ""Hellooooooooo, new friend!"" I walked over to the door, pushing it open to reveal a dark room with a silhouette in the window. I found the light switch and turned it on. He stood outside, looking at me.

But that wasn't what shocked me.

Inside the room, crude drawings littered the walls. Finger paints and crayon scribbles showing two figures: one with yellow hair and the other a raccoon standing on two legs. Some showed them holding hands, smiling, or playing childish games. Others, more disturbing, showed the boy frowning and the raccoon crying.

""Seeeee, me and TeeJay, the two of us go way back,"" he chatted. ""We were the best of best friends!""

""Okay?""

""Now me and you can be best best best best friends,"" he added, tapping gently on the window. “Now can I please come in, oh pretty please?

“No, TJ said do not let you in!” 

“You don’t know TeeJay like I do,” he prodded. “He used to be such a fun boy, but then he changed. Something happened to him.”

“You’re not coming into the house, now go away!”

“He became a cruel cruel boy, and my adventure buddy became so dark,” he continued while waving his hand around the window. “You see it here in this room, don’t you?” 

“I don’t care,” I insisted as he put down his hand, suddenly becoming silent for a moment. Even with the raccoon head, I could feel his stare boring right through me, leaving my stomach in knots.

“He will hurt you like he hurt me,” he replied, his voice with a light tremble. “But if you let me in, I won’t let anyone, especially TeeJay, hurt my new best friend.” 

""My mind raced, the absurdity of it all impossible. This had to be some sick joke, and there was only one person who would do something like this. 'Alright, cut the crap,' I smirked. 'I'll give it to you, this is probably a funny prank, TJ.'

""I'm not TJ, I am a talking raccoon!""

""Talking raccoons don't exist. You're just a weird prankster in a costume.""

He stood there, outside in the wind. For a moment, he lifted his fake paw and began rubbing his chin. I could hear him sigh as he conceded, still in his cartoonish voice, ""Alright, you caught me, good job! You passed the friendship test!""

I let out a sigh of relief. ""Alright, I'm glad we can end this game. Honestly, it was starting to freak me out.""

'Yeah, sorry, sometimes I get a little carried away,' he chuckled, turning his head toward the front door. 'I'll see you inside, I guess...'

""Can you take off the suit? I mean, it actually does sort of give me the creeps.""

""What?"" he replied, turning his head back to me.

""Take off the head part at least,'"" I said as I stepped a little closer to the window. He started to breathe heavily but stood there without saying a word. I began to feel a little uneasy again, starting to doubt myself. ""Come on, take it off and you can come inside.""

""But I can't do that.""

""Alright, there's one way to settle this then,"" I said, thinking of a solution to rest any doubt. I pulled up my phone and called TJ's number. The phone began to ring as we stood in a staring contest.

""What are you doing?'""

""I'm calling you, TJ.""

""No, no, don't do that. My phone is in the treehouse!""

""What?""

""Hello?"" I heard TJ's voice over the phone. My eyes widened, and I began to panic. Suddenly, the man in the raccoon suit started to scratch at the window menacingly, tearing the screen.

""You're not the fucking raccoon?"" I shouted loudly over the phone.

""What? Of course, I'm not. Is he there? Seriously?"" TJ answered.

""Yes, he told me he was you!""

""Just stay inside the house. I'm on my way back,"" TJ replied before hanging up. He noticed that I was no longer on the phone and bolted away from the window as I ran out of the room. I could hear a doorknob rattling from somewhere as I ran back to the foyer area to see him trying to open it.

""TJ's on his way!""

""Nooooooooo!"" he cried, pounding on the door. I feared he might break in and didn't know what he was capable of. ""Let me in!""

""He'll be home soon!""

The begging and banging stopped, but the silence was brief. I heard a crash and ran through the house, searching for him. The sounds grew more violent, and I thought he was trying to break in. But I found no sign of him inside the house.

Then I heard glass shattering. The raccoon man had a rock and was smashing my car windows. Glass flew everywhere as he swung his furry arm. He stopped, and I felt relieved until I saw something worse.

A small red gas can, labeled with the word lawnmower. He was pouring gasoline inside. ""No, no, no!"" I shouted as he lit a grill lighter.

I darted to the front door, unlocked it, and ran outside. Flames erupted from my car's shattered windows. I stopped as the fire grew, engulfing the interior. Then I heard a door slam. He was inside.

""Oh crap,"" I muttered. I heard tires squealing and saw headlights approaching. I quickly ran out of the way as TJ burst out, ""Where is he?""

""I think he went inside.""

TJ stormed towards his house, and I followed meekly. He pushed the door open aggressively. ""Don't make me do it!"" he shouted. I lingered in the foyer, still fearful and not knowing what would transpire.

""TJ, where is he?"" I yelled as I heard someone running in the living room. I cautiously approached and saw TJ and the raccoon man facing each other. TJ held a broom.

""Raccoons live outside! Shoo!"" TJ taunted, swinging the broom wildly. A loud crack echoed as the broom hit the man. ""Get out of here now!""

""No, I won, I finally won!"" the man shouted, blocking his face. ""I won, you can't shoo me anymore!""

""I told you raccoons live outside!"" TJ insisted, hitting him again.

""TJ, I'm calling the cops,"" I barked, pulling out my phone. But then I saw him dive at TJ, tackling him to the ground. They rolled around, knocking over the coffee table. The raccoon costume's head came off. He looked like TJ, except his hair was long and tangled, with a beard. His skin covered in dried mud and god knows what else, and his eyes wide with frenzy.

""I won, it's been five years,"" he snarled. He stood up, holding the broken broom handle. ""Now it's your turn to be the raccoon and live outside.""

I watched as he shoved the raccoon head onto TJ. I wasn't sure if I should call the cops. I walked outside and looked at my burning car, wondering how I was going to get home.",5,1728100109.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Before I left home, me and my girlfriend ended things between us. She was going through some tough personal stuff, and with me leaving as well, we decided that our relationship wasn’t manageable at the time. 

We ended things very amicably, and said that we still loved each other and were always there for each other. We’ve talked a little since then, she reached out to me not long ago saying she missed me, and wanted to check in with me. So we still really care about each other. She was my best friend, and needless to say I took it pretty hard and it’s been tough recently. 

So anyway, my first week at college I met this girl at an event, we just talked for a while about a similar interest, and then went our separate ways, so I didn’t think much about cus I met a ton of people my first week. A while after that she found me on instagram and added me. She sent a message to confirm it was me, and then suggested that we do something sometime. So I confirmed I was the same person, and then just said yea that sounds cool, cus we did seem to have similar interests. Just now she’s asked me to get coffee sometime. 

Don’t get me wrong, this girl seems cool, and I’d be fine hanging out with her. But since I just ended things with my girlfriend I’m really not looking to start something with anyone right now. This as well as the fact that she’s not really the kind of girl I’d be romantically interested in anyway. I’d like to be friends with her cus I’m always up for making new friends, but I’m not really sure that’s what she meant by asking me to get coffee. I’m a little confused and don’t want to come across rude or mean by immediately turning her down though. 

Is there a good way to let her know I’m not interested romantically? Or should I just turn her down outright? I’m not sure what to say to her. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you. ",1,1728099562.0,LifeAdvice,2,1.0,False

Life’s too short to sweat the small stuff, so I focus on the positives and live each day with a smile.


I’m looking for someone who appreciates a man who’s genuine, caring, and isn’t afraid to be himself. Whether it’s sharing a meal, exploring new places, or just enjoying a cozy night in, I’m all about making real connections and having fun along the way.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Third F in the class for me, not showing up for mental health reasons was not the first time this section, won't be taking this class ever again even if I wanted to.

The year 2021 never happened in my canon but just note something horrible happened where caffeine discontinuation was a factor, not a leading reason in my mind even but a present fact, in whatever you dont know what Im talking about

In april this year I stopped showing up to a volunteer opportunity I was very steady with, that I symbolically considered to be a job (without pay) because of the hours I was fine with doing and the nature of where I was volunteering, like I then realized I inherently wasnt indebted to them in the first place but discontinuing caffeine was an overlap of me finally stopping to sign up again for each week

In like July, i was supposed to reinstate my EBT qualification merits to my local county social department of services by the end of JUly, basic resubmitting ok on an online form for literally what i had to do. for the month of July i was completely caffeine free and when I was nonplussed in August when i couldnt buy food anymore, and in my process of re-applying after this fact, i fudged something somehow and denoted something I am doing which I'm not, and now I receive $150 less a month for entering something in a field i dont even remember being aware of. 

Discontinuing caffeine completely always ends with my horrible life becoming worse in a completely preventable way of me not stepping to the left to whatever was in front of me at the time.

There's Northridge mall but I feel like the OUTDOOR courtyard at the back they have is pretty small and it's just super dated, there's buffallo wings there and the parking is free, huge lots, you can also go dave n busters if you're bored and want to spend $$. The topanga westfield in woodland hills, though I don't think I can put this on the list, maybe it was just us hanging around laughing at the indoor benches but a security came to shoo us away, okay, we brought our monopoly board lol.  Their new ""topanga social"" looks super spacey, but they took tables and chairs away and put them close to businesses. We like spending but not always when we go out. I feel like their new spot is perfect to not loiter but bring a board game or two, who knows we might even spend $40 on a blended drink you could make at home. There is of course the village, this one's a little nicer, closest to any community center we can probably get, thank goodness they developed this, well it's nothing but expensive shops that foreclose after a couple of months but the parking's free for 2 hours, and you can always relax at the benches even bring a date there, the strip is not too big, and it's always a bit more too traffic heavy but there are some small spots where you can just chill and bring a board game. Any places by Ventura or Encino? Any little spots like these that are shaded, with tables and chairs or where you won't get hustled out if you spend a little bit more time on plus a board game or two? No we don't want to a coffee place, just anything spacey, courtyard, and like free to hang out communities like they have in many spots in New York maybe? But in SFV?",7,1728098212.0,SFV,3,1.0,False
1fwh6nf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1fwh6nf/i_tried_to_defend_my_girlfriend_in_a_fight_and/,I tried to defend my girlfriend in a fight and lost. She is now low key disgusted with me,"My girlfriend and I recently went out with a group of friends to a bar. I was leaving the bathroom when one of her girlfriends ran up to me and said my GF was about to fight another girl in the parking lot and to come. By the time we got there, they were already fighting. A crowd gathered and nobody did anything but watch. So I ran in and tried to get between them with the intention of stopping it. My GF was drunk and taunting the other girl from a safe distance. The other girl was younger, looked like college aged maybe and was smaller but solid looking like she was an athlete. My GF is 25 and I am 28 for comparison. 

She was swinging at me, I put my hands up and tried to defend myself and I basically got my ass kicked immediately. The only ""fight"" I was ever in was in middle school and it was broken up by teachers almost as soon as it started. I got punched back then and I always thought I knew what being punched was like. This woman damn near knocked me out! Everything just fucking stopped and I thought someone threw something at my head at first. It was nothing like the time in middle school!

The whole thing was over in seconds. I went from the shock of getting hit to feeling rage and trying to fight back to being on the ground with her on top of me and having a panic attack from feeling helpless and pleading for her to stop. Others pulled her off of me and I my GF was freaking out and saying I needed medical attention. I could hear others saying ""did you see that? She just fucked that dude up!!""I was feeling better physically but I felt like I drank ten cups of coffee and needed to just take a moment to calm down. My girlfriend was apologizing at first but I can tell she was disappointed at how I did. 

She even asked if I was drunk later that night because she was fighting this girl and holding her own for a little while before I got there and I just got my ass kicked almost instantly. She was drunk as well but bringing that up doesn't really help me. I guess she's just better at fighting? I never thought I'd have to worry about it after school was over. I also never thought it would be some issue in our relationship, we are both pretty liberal and she is reacting how my dad would react if he knew about it.

She's been more and more silent and moody and won't say what is wrong even though it's obvious. She also doesn't want to talk about what caused the fight in the first place. My GF doesn't usually drink to the point of getting into fights so it's not like anything like this happened before. 

I know vaguely that her friend and her used to party quite a bit in college but she hasn't been like that since I've known her. Never liked to talk about it either. I'm guessing maybe she got into fights before, which is why she could hold her own and I could not.. and that's why she's now upset. ",1,1728098200.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

Wouaaaa I just had my last drink for at least 3 months and hopefully forever but my willpower sucks so I'm trying to be realistic. 😬😢

I’m 40 years old, I’ve been suffering from chronic acid reflux for 5 years, and I’m experiencing symptoms of hormonal imbalance.

I recently decided to do everything I can to age healthily and get rid of my digestive issues. In addition to nutritional changes, I’ve decided to quit caffeine and… alcohol.

I don’t see myself as having an addiction, but it’s a bad habit. I drink often, sometimes 6-8 days in a row but in small amounts. It’s often a way to relax after long days at workor to manage my hyperactive brain. I frequently take breaks from drinking for 2 to 8 weeks, but I’d like to quit for good because even in moderation, it’s unhealthyand I'm scared of being sick.

Just like quitting coffee, fast food, and dairy, I feel it’s going to be tough to stop drinking alcohol, especially with my active social life. I know I’m capable, but I need tools to help maintain my efforts, as I tend to easily give up on my attempts.

I need tips and your encouragement, which I’ll read over and over during my journey!

My Google-fu is not enough.

Do you know where could I find replacements for it? Or better yet how to fix it?

I still want to be with her. This is effecting me as much as wanting to take the easy way out. ,"Hey guys needing some help and advice. My partner of a year ended really bad four days ago.(Me being kicked out and sleeping in my car on my birthday no where to go as I don't have family or support in Australia)

We have been a little up and down throughout and alot of it has been me being insecure but she did start off the relionship with messaging someone else and it hurt me bad, but the fighting got progressively worse not on my part because I learnt to not call names or dive into it when she got angry and aggressive. I would always try explain my feelings and be emotionally mature. I know what I need to change exactly as I have thought long and hard about this and us living serpately will defuse alot of stress on both of us. I feel this when you do this to me then she would kick off. Did I say to much?  Can't go wrong with saying your feelings right ? But she would always get angry or kick off when I would explain it like she hated feeling guilty or she would just loose it and start yelling or getting aggressive and saying things like you want this relationship to work you were the one insecure and controlling all sorts. Would still call me names and what not just got nasty. But i never stopped loving her and she loved me im sure.

 We had amazing time when we didn't fight but it lead to 4 days ago she lost her shit I tried to console her and she started pushing me and yelling I told her to calm down and relax everything is ok. We will get coffee and have a chill out she kept going and before u know it she was so out of control.

 So all I wanted to do is hold her and cuddle her telling her everything is ok while she did this she was scratching and going crazy then she wanted to drive I said babe your not driving your not ok. Please don't so I stood near the door and she was still screaming. So I finally had to let her go and I said please don't do anything silly. Then I go to get a drink and then police are at home with her they arrest me for not being of good behaviour to her as we had a previous history. I honestly don't think I did anything wrong apart from not letting her go as soon as she raised her voice but it came from a good place just wanting to make sure she was ok. So yeah obviously they see it as DV because I didn't let her go when she wanted to and the rest I did tell them I didn't want to let her out of my sights while she was in this mood but they still charged me and now I have to face court. 


I miss her so much but they have imposed no contact so it makes it hard to organise stuff mind you she did ring me and say to email her as she didn't want call logs on her phone. So I guess I will leave it a few days. Find a place and remove my stuff from hers next week. But I do want to work on things and show her what growing I can do and maybe we don't live together anymore but revisit things again. I have written a email for closure for myself that I am happy to share aswell. She said she wants my stuff out for closure so she can move on with her life. I feel like she is doing everything she can to force herself to forget about me. Saying she doesn't want to see or hear my voice etc. I know she loved me and cared for me. Just this happened and now obviously her friends and family will be supporting her. This has taken a massive toll on me and contemplating life atm, but my kids (to another women) are keeping me afloat. ",2,1728097814.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

His father's quirk always seemed normal to him, I mean he could have fire breath, that's really common, but at the same time his father had a ""genetic blessing"" photographic memory he never saw him forgetting anything he never saw him forgetting his birthday or forgetting his anniversaries with Inko  
  
Although something that Izuku always felt strange was that his father had seasons where he disappeared for """"work"""" strange because his father works two things, he has a gym and a martial arts dojo, in those times when he disappears he always gives him four golden rules. him and his mother  
  
1-dye your hair from time to time  
  
2-put on contact lenses, I left them in the bathroom don\`t loose them like last time  
  
3-use false surnames, i leaved the documents in the cupboard    
  
4-Use the phones that I leave in the living room of the house, they are black phones, they are untraceable and in turn they delete the contacts after 24 hours   
  
-I love them both   
  
Hisashi was always strict with Izuku, not to the point of hating him for being quirkless but to the point of being somewhat overprotective and having a list of people to hit in case something happens.  
  
Izuku never knew that his father is a HPSC mercenary, although that would explain why his father has so much money as if he had no end to the point that one day he gave him a one-day ticket with all might that was worth 2,500 dollars.   
  
(although he doesn't know that his father didn't pay)

All Might: but I do go to all your son's birthdays he literally calls me Uncle Might  
  
Hisashi: I take out the tube.  
  
All Might: Okay, okay, knowing what you are, you were probably going to do it.  
  
Hisashi: actually yes

Izuku is not Katsuki's childhood friend, these two met when they were 10 years old.   
  
Izuku is a childhood friend of Tenya Iida, and of Shoto, since due to his father's mercenary work they used to move constantly. He met Tenya as children and Shoto some time later. He is also a friend of Kaminari, Yaoyorozu, and Sato.  
  
Hisashi is the one who buys the most at the Sato bakery since they make the best coffee and they do good things in everything that is pastry.   
  
Hisashi has always worked for the HPSC before Nagant left, he used to ask her to act as a babysitter although it was often the other way around since Kaina was trained by Hisashi.   
  
Hisashi is a good friend of Hawks so he also babysat Izuku.  
  
Keigo: Do ​​I have to do it?  
  
Hisashi: Look, you piece of KFC with legs, I'm going to go with Inko to a 5,000 dollar dinner in a restaurant that isn't pretentious about meals being experiences...do you know how hard it is to find a place like that? Do you know how many people I had to ask? DO YOU KNOW?  
  
Keigo: okay...okay   
  
Inko knows about her husband's work and supports him many times. She has gone to see him according to Keigo and Kaina makes good katsudon.  
  
Hisashi has a huge collection of trophies that makes Aoyama's brilliance look like the brilliance of a mere little star against the brilliance of a fucking galaxy.  
  
Izuku found out about his father's job after the Kamino incident as he saved Izuku from an AFO attack that destroyed part of Hisashi's suit.   
  
Hisashi also had to take care of Overhaul after Shigaraki disintegrated his arms.  
  
Hisashi: I ALREADY ASKED THE HPSC TO SEND YOU PROSTHETIC ROBOTIC ARMS STOP CRYING MY GOD I WOULD HAVE ASKED SHIGARAKI TO DISINTEGRATE YOUR MOUTH YOU ARE WORSE THAN IZUKU AS A BABY 

Hisashi did not kill Kaina when she escaped, he arranged with the U.S. government to give her protection.   
  
Hisashi: I know you're going to leave... you know? I thought you were going to last less... but you were a good student... you can go, I will say that you left me mortally wounded  
  
Kaina: don't exaggerate, no one would believe that.  
  
Hisashi: ...I don't want to pretend like we're in a fight to the death...I broke my back helping Izuku...so can we just pretend you beat me?  
  
Hisashi hates Aizawa...they went to U.A together...Hisashi blames him for Shirakumo and also for the apprehension test...NO ONE would do anything to Izuku by abusing power   
  
Hisashi: I'm going to expel you but expel your dead grandmother.  
  
Aizawa: and you are a...em...a...um 

Hisashi mentally: heh i waited years for this  
  
Hisashi: a good father?  
  
Aizawa: THAT WAIT NO NO NO NO THAT WAS WHAT I SAID  
  
Hisashi: You didn't have to clarify it, I already know that I am a good father and a good Samaritan.   
  
Hisashi and Endeavor are cousins, they often go to the same bar called ""the forgotten ones"" in fact almost all the heroes go there...surprisingly because it is a seedy bar and the owner is a one-eyed man.   
  
Hisashi also works as a private teacher in training for students.   
  
Hisashi: the fee is in yen but if you want heavy training it is in dollars  
  
Hawks and Hisashi planned for the HPSC to gradually lose power and Hisashi planned for Hawks being the new president.

All Might gave OFA to Izuku because Hisashi threatened him  
  
although in reality it was more like this  
  
All Might: pffff it's obvious that the United States will win the nationals on basketball this year  
  
Hisashi: if Japan wins you give One For All to my son  
  
All Might: aaaaaah yes and yes em...  
  
Hisashi: are you drunk?  
  
All Might: em, yes, the United States, I'll give it to Mirio.  
  
Hisashi: okay   
  
Weeks later he was forced to wake up and see Hisashi pointing a shotgun at him.  
  
Hisashi: I don't care if you were drunk, give OFA to my son  
  
Yes, let's say that Hisashi and Nighteye are water and oil and are capable of arguing over the slightest and in fact one time Hisashi left Nigtheye with a black eye because according to Hisashi Nighteye ordered refined food at the bar and this caused an argument  
  
Fat gum: did you record it?  
  
Gang Orca: yup

Hi all, sharing this in hopes someone else will relate or perhaps shed their personal insights on this topic:

I’m 26F, I’ve been struggling to connect with other women for the past 3 years. The older I’ve gotten, the less interested I find myself in regards to connecting with others. My husband says I’m too picky with the type of women I want to connect with. I’m into hiking, book clubs, coffee dates, exploring local shops, venturing out and discovering local areas, museums, getting creative and doing adventurous activities that challenge you. I’ve never been the type of woman who is into groupies or cliques, I’ve considered myself to be a solitary woman for as long as I’ve known myself, but lately, being alone has been bothering me. I work from home, Monday through Friday, so that’s also a major setback (I don’t have the opportunity to interact with others in real time), spending all week long at home in silence and then waiting for the weekend to come and not have anything exciting going on. I don’t have any children, so my lifestyle is pretty much work, be alone majority of the time, and doing some sort of cardio/strength training activity throughout the week. My “fun” activities consist of looking up local farmer’s market (which is hard given the area we’re in — super boring and dull) to pass time.

However recently I started getting more into matcha particularly with matcha lattes, fruit syrups, and cream toppings. I've been exploring recipes and sharing them with friends all of whom enjoys (hopefully they aren't lying lol). 

I recently starting considering maybe hosting a matcha bar at a local farmers market. I believe this can definitely be something of a passion project of mine to espace the 9-5 life.

So I am here to ask, what are some gaps you guys find about current matcha bars out there?

","The dimly lit coffee shop was bustling with the usual afternoon crowd. Among them sat Isabella, a 28-year-old Latina with long, dark hair, olive skin, and warm, brown eyes. She was absorbed in a book, her slender fingers nervously tracing the spine. Across from her, a tall, broad-shouldered man named Lucas sat, his muscular frame barely fitting into the small chair. His piercing blue eyes were fixed on Isabella, a small smile playing on his lips.

""You know, it's rude to stare,"" Isabella said without looking up, her voice soft but firm.

Lucas chuckled, ""I can't help it. You're captivating.""

Isabella finally looked up, her cheeks flushing slightly. ""You're too forward,"" she replied, but her eyes sparkled with amusement.

""Only with you,"" Lucas responded, his voice low and sultry. ""Tell me, what are you reading?""

""Just a mystery novel,"" she said, holding up the book. ""It's nothing interesting.""

""Everything about you is interesting,"" Lucas countered. ""How about dinner? Tomorrow night?""

Isabella hesitated before nodding. ""Okay. But only if you promise not to be so forward.""

Lucas laughed, extending his hand. ""Deal.""

The next evening, they met at an intimate Italian restaurant. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, the soft candlelight casting a glow over their table. Isabella wore a simple black dress that accentuated her curves, while Lucas looked handsome in a dark suit.

""You look beautiful, Bella,"" Lucas said as he pulled out her chair.

""Thank you,"" she replied, her eyes meeting his. ""You're not so bad yourself.""

Dinner was filled with laughter and easy conversation. Lucas was charming and witty, making Isabella laugh more than she had in a long time. As they finished their dessert, Lucas reached across the table, taking Isabella's hand in his.

""I really enjoy your company, Bella,"" he said sincerely.

Isabella felt a warmth spread through her. ""I enjoy yours too, Lucas.""

The night ended with a soft kiss on Isabella's cheek. The next few weeks were filled with dates—movies, walks in the park, and late-night talks. Each time, Lucas would drop her off at her doorstep with a tender kiss, leaving her wanting more.

One evening, as they sat on her couch watching a movie, Lucas turned to face her. ""You know, I've been wanting to do this for a while,"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. He leaned in, his lips brushing against hers. Isabella hesitated for a moment before kissing him back, her hands sliding up to his chest.

Lucas deepened the kiss, his tongue gently exploring her mouth. Isabella moaned softly, her body pressing against his. Lucas broke the kiss, his eyes locked onto hers. ""I want you, Bella,"" he said, his voice hoarse with desire.

Isabella's breath hitched, her heart pounding in her chest. ""I-I want you too,"" she admitted.

Lucas smiled, pulling her closer. Their kisses became more passionate, their hands roaming over each other's bodies. Lucas's hand slipped under Isabella's shirt, his fingers tracing the line of her waist. She gasped as he cupped her breast, his thumb circling her nipple through the fabric.

""You're so beautiful,"" he murmured against her lips.

Isabella pulled back slightly, her eyes wide with desire. ""Show me,"" she whispered.

Lucas smiled, his hands moving to the hem of her shirt. He lifted it slowly, revealing her soft, creamy skin. He leaned in, his lips capturing one of her nipples through the thin fabric of her bra. Isabella arched her back, a soft moan escaping her lips.

""You taste amazing,"" Lucas said, his voice filled with desire. He unhooked her bra, his mouth capturing her nipple again, this time with no barrier. Isabella cried out, her hands tangling in his hair.

Lucas moved to her other breast, giving it the same attention. Isabella's body was on fire, her skin sensitive to his touch. She could feel the wetness between her legs, her body aching for more.

Lucas moved lower, his lips trailing kisses down her stomach. He unbuttoned her jeans, his fingers slipping inside to stroke her clit through her panties. Isabella moaned, her hips bucking against his hand.

""You're so wet,"" he murmured, his voice filled with lust. ""I want to taste you.""

Isabella nodded, her breath coming in short gasps. Lucas slipped off her jeans and panties, leaving her completely exposed. He settled between her legs, his tongue licking her slowly. Isabella cried out, her hands gripping the couch cushions.

Lucas's tongue was relentless, licking and sucking her clit until Isabella was on the edge of orgasm. ""Lucas,"" she gasped, her body trembling. ""I'm going to come.""

Lucas didn't stop, his tongue working her clit until Isabella screamed his name, her body convulsing with pleasure. Lucas kissed her thighs, his hands caressing her body.

""That was incredible,"" Isabella said, her breath still ragged.

Lucas smiled, unbuttoning his pants. ""And I'm not done yet.""

Isabella looked at him, her eyes filled with desire. ""Show me,"" she said again.

Lucas slid his pants off, his cock hard and ready. Isabella licked her lips, her eyes locked onto it. ""I want to taste you,"" she said, her voice filled with lust.

Lucas groaned, his cock twitching at her words. He moved closer, his cock inches from her face. Isabella leaned in, her tongue licking the tip. Lucas moaned, his hands tangling in her hair.

""Suck it, Bella,"" he groaned. ""Take me deep.""

Isabella opened her mouth, taking him in as far as she could. Lucas threw his head back, a groan escaping his lips. ""That feels so good,"" he murmured.

Isabella sucked harder, her hands stroking his shaft. Lucas's hips moved, his cock sliding in and out of her mouth. ""Faster, Bella,"" he groaned. ""Suck me faster.""

Isabella did as he asked, her head bobbing up and down on his cock. Lucas's breath was coming in short gasps, his body tensing. ""I'm going to come, Bella,"" he warned.

Isabella sucked harder, her hand stroking his cock. Lucas threw his head back, a groan escaping his lips as he came, his hot cum filling Isabella's mouth. She swallowed, her eyes locked onto his.

Lucas pulled her up, his lips capturing hers in a passionate kiss. ""You're incredible,"" he murmured against her lips.

They have cups and cans and bottles all over their nightstand and desk and have even had a cup under their bed on the dresser before, and they’re never empty either. They also go home every weekend so they don’t really have dishes or real food here so they’re all Starbucks and Dunkin’ cups, so half full coffees just sitting there separating for weeks as they go home and come back.

I planned to source to a local small business preferably a coffee shop of some sort and offer a free analysis of their setup and coverage along with security. Though looking I was not aware of how expensive some of these tools were. I do not feel like spending money but may if needed.

I feel a little in over my head but it is already an approved project so I kind of have to roll with it now, the plan was to of course get permission from a shop owner and get a floor plan. From there use Netspot to map out any noise in the building that may be causing any potential interference. With that, do passive scanning from my computer on the dBm signals ranging over the site and find any potential dead zones.  I would then have my document of the floor plan along with the different dBm levels over the areas. 

After the survey is done, I would look into their security with permission such as WPA being used, guest network, default passwords, and such. 

With all that I would do a write-up of my findings to provide to my professor as well as shop owner and discuss any small recommendations. I do not feel comfortable quite yet telling them to buy anything but would make recommendations on tweaking any specific settings or maybe placement of current modem or AP. 

That is the plan, this is a first for me but I just wanted an outside perspective of if there is something I am missing or tools that others find useful in site surveys I can take a look at that are not too expensive. Any input would be useful!!",1,1728095780.0,networking,2,1.0,False

30F 260lb 5’8

Physical Conditions: PMDD (suspected), high cholesterol

Meds: loestrin, Flonase generic (daily), newly prescribed albuterol inhaler as needed up to 4 times/day 

Normal BP, blood panel, liver/kidney function, heart and lung sound normal under stethoscope according to MD yesterday morning

I will start by saying if it doesn’t clear up over the weekend, I’m booking an appointment for someone to look at my lungs. 

I have never had bad allergies. I live in an area that is notoriously bad for allergy sufferers, but only started having mild seasonal allergies in college. I skirted by without necessarily needing meds, but would take from time to time if the symptoms were bothering me. I know Flonase is a daily med, but I have not been taking it regularly enough to have its protection unfortunately. I’ve never been tested for allergies but I believe I’m allergic to mold especially. I also have an adult onset pecan allergy that’s mild but not tested to see if it has worsened. 

So this Tuesday I felt sluggish, like my body felt like sludge and I had brain fog. I didn’t have other allergy symptoms like PND, hives, etc. I asked my partner how they were feeling and they said they felt terrible from allergies, too. I chalked it up to that. 

Wednesday started normally (took some Flonase in the morning) but after a midday walk I felt my throat close up a bit and my breathing restrict, like I couldn’t easily take a full breath. It’s a similar reaction to when I eat pecans without the hives. I return inside, take a Claritin midday, and rest while my body calms down. I return to feeling okay as the Claritin worked and I could breathe comfortably. I go outside to hang out/sit in the front yard and I start feeling poorly again. My face gets slightly tingly in my sinuses and I feel like I can’t take a deep breath. No apparent arrhythmia or heart palps, but I think the anxiety around the reaction is making me cognizant of my body functions I’m noticing. (My anxiety doesn’t usually present like this.) 

Went to the doctor as a last minute annual exam that would also address my current issue Thursday morning. MD listened to my heart and lungs but said they were normal. I got my annual bloodwork which did show high cholesterol, but that is something I anticipated and I’ve been working on this latter half of the year to reduce when my partner got diagnosed as pre diabetic. Liver/kidney function normal, RBC/WBC normal, vitamin normal, not pre- or diabetic, thyroid normal. MD prescribed an inhaler which I picked up today. 

I had another “attack” today before I could pick up my inhaler, though. I had been outside normal at a coffee shop’s outdoor seating for around an hour without issue, but when returning to my workplace and being outside in the yard I had a bad reaction again (face tingling, could breathe but couldn’t comfortably take a deep breath). I took another Claritin but it took a minute to kick in and I really didn’t feel relief until after I picked up and took the albuterol inhaler. I went home and napped and felt better after resting. I was able to go out to dinner with my partner on a patio and while I was conscious of my breathing and heart beat, I don’t think I was struggling or anything while out on the patio. 

More context: I am currently menstruating because I accidentally missed three active pills in the second week. My OB prescribed that I skip the placebo week and jump straight to the second pack. Not pregnant. Not covid positive. No fever. Some on and off headache since Tuesday when I missed my third pill. I’ve had Covid twice in 2022, strep in 2023, have sensitive sinuses but my last sinus infection was February 2024. 

I know it’s better addressed by a professional in person, but I was just curious if my case is pointing to anything specific? Again, if it persists over the weekend I will make an appointment specific to my lungs. Also, sorry if there’s too much irrelevant info; I wasn’t sure if any of it would help. Thanks!

""Yeah, baby, just like that,"" John said, his voice strained with pleasure.

Sarah continued to bob her head up and down on John's cock, her hands playing with his balls and stroking his shaft. John could feel himself getting close to the edge, his balls tightening up as he prepared to cum.

""I'm gonna cum, Sarah,"" John said, his voice hoarse with pleasure.

Sarah pulled back, stroking John's cock with her hand as he erupted, cum shooting out in thick, white ropes all over her face and tits.

""Fuck, yeah,"" John moaned, collapsing back onto the couch as Sarah licked the remaining cum off her fingers.

I don't want to take the easy way out. M32 F32 ,"TL;DR Hey guys needing some help and advice. My partner of a year ended really bad four days ago.(Me being kicked out and sleeping in my car on my birthday no where to go as I don't have family or support in Australia)

We have been a little up and down throughout and alot of it has been me being insecure but she did start off the relionship with messaging someone else and it hurt me bad, but the fighting got progressively worse I don't think on my part because I learnt to not call names or dive into it when she got angry and aggressive but she would continue to do this when she didnt like what i would say or my feelings. 

I would always try explain my feelings and be emotionally mature. I know what I need to change exactly as I have thought long and hard about this and us living serpately will defuse alot of stress on both of us.I would explain I feel this when you do this to me but that would kick her off.  Was I wrong to explain myself ?  But she would always get angry or kick off when I would explain it like she hated feeling guilty or she would just loose it and start yelling or aggressive. U want this relationship to work you were the one insecure and controlling all sorts. Would still call me names and what not just got nasty. But i never stopped loving her and she loved me im sure.

 We had amazing time when we didn't fight but it lead to 4 days ago she lost her shit I tried to console her and she started pushing me and yelling I told her to calm down and relax everything is ok. We will get coffee and have a chill out she kept going and before u know it she was so out of control. So all I wanted to do is hold her and cuddle her telling her everything is ok while she did this she was scratching and going crazy then she wanted to drive I said babe your not driving your not ok. Please don't so I stood near the door and she was still screaming. So I finally had to let her go and I said please don't do anything silly. Then I go to get a drink and then police are at home with her they arrest me for not being of good behaviour to her as we had a previous history. I honestly don't think I did anything wrong apart from not letting her go as soon as she raised her voice but it came from a good place just wanting to make sure she was ok. So yeah obviously they see it as DV because I didn't let her go when she wanted to and the rest I did tell them I didn't want to let her out of my sights while she was in this mood but they still charged me and now I have to face court. 


I miss her so much but they have imposed no contact so it makes it hard to organise stuff mind you she did ring me and say to email her as she didn't want call logs on her phone. So I guess I will leave it a few days. Find a place and remove my stuff from hers next week. But I do want to work on things and show her what growing I can do and maybe we don't live together anymore but revisit things again. I have written a email for closure for myself that I am happy to share aswell. She said she wants my stuff out for closure so she can move on with her life. I feel like she is doing everything she can to force herself to forget about me. Saying she doesn't want to see or hear my voice etc. I know she loved me and cared for me. Just this happened and now obviously her friends and family will be supporting her. This has taken a massive toll on me and contemplating life atm, but my kids (to another women) are keeping me afloat. ",1,1728094935.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

","One day, in the bustling city of New York, a young man named Jake was walking home from work when he noticed a beautiful woman standing in the rain, looking lost. He approached her and asked if she needed help. She looked up at him with her piercing green eyes and shook her head.

""I'm fine,"" she said, her voice dripping with sadness. ""I just had a fight with my boyfriend.""

Jake's heart went out to her. He introduced himself and offered to buy her a cup of coffee. She hesitated for a moment before agreeing. Over the next few hours, they talked and laughed like old friends. Jake couldn't help but feel drawn to this mysterious woman.

""I'm sorry,"" she said, looking down at her hands. ""I didn't even tell you my name. It's Yumi.""

Jake's heart skipped a beat. He had never met anyone like Yumi before. They exchanged numbers and promised to keep in touch.

Over the next few weeks, Jake and Yumi grew closer. They texted every day, and Jake found himself falling for her more and more. He asked her out on a date, and she said yes.

They went to a fancy restaurant in Manhattan, and Jake couldn't take his eyes off of Yumi. She looked stunning in her little black dress. They laughed and joked, and Jake felt like he was on top of the world.

As the night went on, Yumi leaned in closer to Jake.

""I want you,"" she whispered in his ear.

Jake's heart raced. He had never been with a woman like Yumi before. She was confident, seductive, and just a little bit dangerous.

They left the restaurant and went back to Jake's apartment. Yumi pushed him up against the wall and kissed him deeply. Jake's hands explored her body, and he could feel the heat radiating off of her.

""Take me to the bedroom,"" Yumi demanded.

Jake led her to the bedroom, and they fell onto the bed in a tangle of limbs. Yumi pulled off Jake's shirt and ran her hands over his chest.

""You're so hot,"" she murmured.

Jake kissed her neck and nibbled on her earlobe. He could feel her heart racing.

""I want to taste you,"" he whispered.

Yumi smiled and spread her legs. Jake kissed his way down her body, taking in the scent of her arousal. He licked her clit, and she gasped.

""Oh, yes, just like that,"" she moaned.

Jake licked and sucked on her clit, feeling her body tremble beneath him. He slid a finger inside of her, and she moaned louder.

""Fuck, yes, don't stop,"" she begged.

Jake continued to lick and finger her, feeling her body tense up. She cried out as she came, her juices flowing onto Jake's face.

""I want you inside of me,"" Yumi demanded.

Jake climbed on top of her and slid his cock inside of her. She was so wet and tight, and Jake couldn't help but moan.

""Oh, fuck, you feel amazing,"" he said.

Yumi wrapped her legs around Jake's waist and pulled him deeper inside of her.

""Harder,"" she demanded.

Jake thrust harder and harder, feeling his own orgasm building.

""I'm going to cum,"" he said.

""Cum inside of me,"" Yumi demanded.

Jake groaned as he came, filling Yumi with his seed.

""That was amazing,"" Jake said, collapsing onto the bed next to Yumi.

""Yes, it was,"" Yumi agreed, a sly smile on her face. ""But I'm not done with you yet.""",1,1728094698.0,u_Real_Button_2421,0,1.0,False
